Why schools?  Just because in a few years we will have to work with graduates of these schools. <br><br>  Our goal, which allows us to more accurately guide the development of a technopark, is to accumulate technical and organizational competencies that enable us to accomplish the tasks of creating our own space program in the horizon for 10-15 years.  It may be nonsense, but the goal is beautiful and quite clear.  I confess that the successes of <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/search/%3Fq%3D%255B%25D0%25AD%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%2520%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%255D%26target_type%3Dposts">Elon Mask</a> are haunting, it is even possible that the creation of an electric car and the development of solar energy will be the main goal before the creation of the spacecraft;)

Not the fact that something will turn out, all the same it is a venture.  But if someone is engaged in similar developments, we will be happy to talk! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ac5/872/2c5/ac58722c5a8d39de3dce80cec5c4edb2.jpg"><br><br>  I will tell about these projects another time, but today's post is devoted to the makertons.  This is a marathon limited by a specific time and place for assembling something technically complex.  <a href="https://vk.com/tarakanov_sv">Semyon Tarakanov</a> , the manager and creator of the hackspace Navigator campus, came up with a new format, and we are now distributing it.  The Makertones are a cool thing with their philosophy, and let some say that it‚Äôs not new, it doesn‚Äôt develop brains and kills creativity in a person, but this is what the critical innovative extremism about us, Russians, says;) <br><br>  The makertones are called upon to involve wide strata of the population in technical creativity, to propagate the philosophy of very good hands and to prove to everyone that 3D printers, copters, CNC machine tools and all that ‚Äî this is not difficult and accessible to everyone who wants to learn and work. <br>  The makertones are designed to create a community and introduce people interested in technology to each other. <br>  The makertons popularize specific open source developments and, in general, the entire open source concept in electronics and robotics, in 3D printing. <br>  Finally, the makertones make it quite cheap to get your 3D printer or other device.  For example, for comparison, the cost of the cheapest kit is 69,000, and the cost of participation in makerton is 50,000. Of course, you can get the parts yourself.  Perhaps it will be cheaper, but it will be an order of magnitude longer and more labor intensive. <br><br>  The makertones are not an established format, they are a challenge and an experiment.  We are now starting to carry out makertones on Ultimaker <a href="http://makerton.org/">3D printers</a> , on <a href="http://www.makerton.ru/">NOVA printers from</a> our Ennova resident, on <a href="https://vk.com/videos-71280119%3Fz%3Dvideo-71280119_168496839%252Fclub71280119">Copters</a> (including two months of piloting training).  Would do more, but not enough time, people, money ... everything is as usual. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f05/5d7/666/f055d76664553e0e6606c8b2676196ce.jpg"><br><br>  July 4 is the first <s>all-Union</s> Russian day of the makertones on Ultimaker printers.  The makertons will be held in almost ten cities immense.  <a href="http://makerton.org/">Here</a> you can see if the organizer of the makerton was found in your city and, if not found yet, become one.  You can subscribe to updates in your city about providing makertones.  Attention!  It's not just about 3D printers, but generally about any makerton. <br>  Now we are forced to order parts one month before the makerton, everything that is available is divergent (110 sets went off in May), so if someone doesn‚Äôt have enough details on July 4th, they will have to wait until August, the makertones will be held monthly.  The minimum number of participants on each makerton is 3, the maximum is 10. <br><br>  And today, May 26, begins a series of <a href="http://makerton.marabaka.ru/">makertones for schoolchildren of</a> Tatarstan on the order of the Government of the Republic.  100 printers, 100 schools, 300 students, 100 teachers and two weeks.  All for an adult. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7b9/612/e1b/7b9612e1b111b8d0e88b430f5b92fcb8.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Assembling schoolchildren vs delivery ready printers</b> <br>  The participant assembles the printer himself and at the same time examines the 3D printer device in detail.  This is a completely new level of involvement in engineering, design and invention.  A completely new quality of vocational orientation and learning material. <br>  The student does not refer to the printer as a ‚Äúblack box‚Äù.  He understands the printing process well. <br>  Gathered printer is not afraid to interfere with the printer and is not afraid to break it.  Still, he collected it himself! <br>  The participant begins to believe in their own strength.  A simple student can do anything. <br><br>  As a result, the story of computers in the early 2000s may well be repeated, when students pushed teachers away and asked him not to interfere with messing around with smart hardware that they understand better than adults. <br><br>  Why open source, and not some well-known manufacturer? <br>  You can modify Open source yourself, improve the design and change parts, you do not have to wait long for warranty repairs - all drawings are available and you can even repair the printer yourself. <br>  Ultimaker is the most common model opensource 3D printer with the largest community itself.  This means a lot of ready-made instructions and experience.  This means that the member of the makerton will learn from the vast open world community. <br>  Let me remind you that the Navigator Fund has invested in the <a href="http://www.evaprin.com/">Kazan developer of 3D printers</a> and it would be logical to promote them, especially since the guys have a great printer, but long-term goals in this case are more important than short-term benefits.  NOVA, like other Russian printer manufacturers, does not have a large enough user community yet. <br><br>  <b>What then?</b> <br>  All participants are registered in the <a href="http://marabaka.ru/">social network for crazy</a> ‚ÄúMarabaka‚Äù <a href="http://marabaka.ru/">pens</a> , they will post their results (printed models, made printer upgrades), comment and even just pop like it. <br>  The marabic will have training materials in all areas that are necessary for the effective use of a 3D printer so that participants do not have problems with the machine. <br>  Participants will receive tasks through the social network.  For example, we plan to print out <a href="&amp;xid=25657,15700021,15700043,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhq3AuZEwphxxX448L3PT-dw7WteQ#facrc=_&amp;imgdii=_&amp;imgrc=RzZ63OLLpP963M%253A%3BUD0XCReVApRTNM%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fvenagid.ru%252Fwp-content%252Fuploads%252F2011%252F07%252Fkazan.jpg%3B">part of the Kazan Kremlin</a> in Minecraft style with the help of 100 printers (attention, we need crafter volunteers, write <a href="https://vk.com/bazanski">Gleb</a> ).  Each team on its printer will print and paint a small part of the composition, and then we will assemble all the parts into one whole. <br>  Through the social network, participants will receive training materials and will be able to consult with engineers of the hackspace Navigator on Skype. <br><br>  After several test makertones, we realized that the instructions on the Internet are no good.  They are outdated, incomprehensible.  We have developed for our participants our own version of the instructions for assembling a 3D printer (we will post it after a full run-in).  Separately, we made a training manual for teachers on the use of 3D printing in the educational process, so that teachers know how to use new machines (we will also lay out in open access).  Also for schoolchildren, with the help of participants of our hackspace, we conducted quite labor-intensive preparation of parts, made preparations for large-block assembly.  We collected everything that is boring in Ultimaker, in advance, in order not to load schoolchildren with a routine that does not provide any educational benefits, and the number of assembly errors increases significantly. <br>  Makerton completes the calibration of the printer and the printout of the calibration model, which will confirm the quality assembly of each printer.  There is still a competitive moment: the best and fastest teams receive small prizes. <br><br>  As participants, students were selected from all schools of Tatarstan (evenly across all districts, even the most remote and rural), who formed teams, told about themselves, why they need a printer and how they are going to use it. <br>  In general, the makerton organization was not as simple as it was supposed at the beginning.  In the course of preparation, we stepped on all possible rakes that we have overcome in time and are now teaching our residents the tricks of finding suppliers, organizing logistics, assembling, testing, packaging and other processes.  And sometimes we do not teach, but just take it upon ourselves. <br><br>  According to the results of the makertones, we will definitely tell you about the results. <br><br>  Is 3D printing possible in schools?  Full  Affordable 3D printing?  Accessible does not happen.  Is it possible to do this in your area?  Yes, we are quite ready for this. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/224071/">https://habr.com/ru/post/224071/</a></p>
