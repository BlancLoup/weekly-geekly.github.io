Sorry for the curse, but so - briefly, emotionally and correctly.  I will try to justify it long and without emotion, and without the word logic.  At the same time I will share a couple of their conclusions. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In order not to argue in vain, let's agree on terms.  And so, hereinafter " <em>Logic is a way of making decisions, through <strong>conscious</strong> reasoning</em> ."  I do not know how there can be unconscious inference.  It seems to me that Mendeleev invented his table in a dream that way.  In addition to the periodic system in school, we were also taught that our brain consists of gray and white matter.  The first is responsible for the consciousness, the second - for the subconscious.  Given evolution, a conscious way to live 2,000 times younger than the intuitive, that is, based on white matter.  Less does not mean worse or newer; younger means <em>less.</em>  Do not rush to evaluate. <br><br>  Consciousness and subconsciousness, to evaluate and feel ... Obviously, the subconsciousness plays the leading role.  Do not agree?  Then conduct an experiment (found it in V.Levi): <br><ul><li>  we remember 10-20 things that you think are valuable; </li><li>  arrange the resulting list number 1 in ascending order; </li><li>  we remember 10-20 things that sincerely pleased you, you are happy to remember this for a certain period (for example, for 2009); </li><li>  arrange the resulting list number 2 in ascending order; </li><li>  over the same period, we recall 10-20 things that have grieved you; </li><li>  arrange the resulting list number 3 in ascending order; </li><li>  wonder how far the first list is from the second and third. </li></ul><br>  Why is that?  Because our joy or grief is determined by our subconscious.  It is more important, it reinforces your success and defeat emotional state, that is, feelings. <br><br>  Let's look at how these relationships of consciousness and subconsciousness work on concrete examples. <br><blockquote>  The opinion is formed in the first 5 seconds.  It is called the first impression and is very difficult to change. </blockquote><br>  How it looks: the subconscious collected information from the sense of smell, sight, hearing and processed it in 0.2-0.5 seconds.  Slower can not, otherwise you would have eaten 20 thousand years ago.  And then the subconscious gave one of the commands: ‚ÄúMark‚Äù, ‚ÄúRun‚Äù, ‚ÄúEat‚Äù, <s>‚ÄúFuck‚Äù</s> , ‚ÄúSeduce‚Äù.  And already consciousness, having received this command, quickly looks for what to cling to.  Dirty shoes at the guy, the curve layout at the site, spelling error in the article.  These are signs that the object is bad.  All these <strong>logical signs work only if there is no emotional evaluation from the subconscious</strong> or they coincide.  Signs are a reason to recognize a conclusion, but not a reason.  What will happen if they do not coincide with the assessment of the subconscious?  It will be like in that joke: "You say that goat as if it were bad." <br><blockquote>  In our telepathy and telekinesis training groups, 85% of students have a university degree. </blockquote><br>  I saw this phrase in some charlatan reklamka that paper spammers are distributed on the streets.  The funny thing is that they do not lie.  According to statistics, it is.  Members are involved in deception.  Self-deception, to be exact.  People want paranormal abilities.  This is normal.  It is abnormal that <strong>people with higher education are taught how best to deceive themselves by reason</strong> .  Having perfected their self-deception skills, they are more likely to fall for the tricks of the charlatans.  It is necessary to learn not only work with the outside world, but also with the inner.

      It took me 3 years after university to understand the seemingly obvious things: <br><ul><li>  I do not want to find a good employer, I want a payer; </li><li>  I do not want a permanent relationship, I want regular and quality sex; </li><li>  and so on (sorry to hesitate to publish). </li></ul><br>  Oh, by the way, about uni.  Being an applicant, I heard this: <br><blockquote>  Having finished our specialty, you will be highly qualified specialists. </blockquote><br>  So I became.  Not because the teachers prepared me this way, they helped me in this.  The reason is different.  In that I believed that I would become so.  I convinced myself of that.  " <strong>You can convince yourself of anything"</strong> is one of my favorite phrases.  It elegantly aligns the balance of "Consciousness Vs Subconsciousness".  In general, the balance of the conscious and subconscious is a topic for a separate article.  I call people who have it <em>congruent</em> .  They do not contradict themselves or the environment, they simply do not need it.  They are holistic.  I believe I believe that this is most easily achieved by faith.  Moreover, whatever.  Best in your strength. <br><br>  In conclusion, practical recommendations on the application of the conclusions of this article: <br><ol><li>  Your logical reasoning, nothing before the test of time.  Trust more often your mother's intuition. </li><li>  Try to answer the questions " <em>Why ...</em> " when the arguments are already exhausted, answer " <em>I am sure that it is so right</em> " and not repeat the second round or all the more lose my temper. </li><li>  Despite the fact that the line between self-deception and self-suggestion is very subtle, remember: " <em>to engage in self-deception is one of the forms of self-satisfaction</em> ." </li><li>  More often look at yourself from others, others see you only this way. </li><li>  Believe.  Believe anything.  For example, the fact that these 5 points work. </li></ol><br><br>  <b>UPD</b> .  For those who were looking for <i>girls</i> : <br>  Logic is a tool controlled by consciousness.  Consciousness is very changeable, in contrast to the subconscious.  Here is the article and calls for <b>more trust in your intuition</b> . <br>  <a href="http://galkin.in.ua/logika-eto-prostitutka/">Original source</a> <br>  <b>UPD2</b> .  Moved to blog "I'm crazy." </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/80597/">https://habr.com/ru/post/80597/</a></p>
