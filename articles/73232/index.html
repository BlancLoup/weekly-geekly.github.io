      First of all, I would like to thank <a href="http://www.becompact.ru/notebook/sony/aw/Sony-Vaio-VGN-AW2XRY-Q">these</a> kind people for not being afraid to provide a laptop for a test.  Not every company will agree to give a laptop worth one hundred thousand rubles to the first passerby.  And <a href="http://pentar.ru/catalog/product/qm-productId-eq-1259284411187244.htm">this miracle</a> for the photos;) <br><br>  Yes, friends, it is a pleasure to work with ASUS, but ... I did not sign any documents about the fact that I couldn‚Äôt write about something else and that I would put all the dissidents on a stake.  As there was not a word about the fact that I should write about ASUS only positive reviews, etc ... I just write detailed reviews that the IT audience reads - I think any manufacturer would be interested in this.  The fact that a large company is not afraid to take even bloggers into its service is only a plus for it) Therefore, one should not look for any causal relationships. <br><br>  And yet, so that ASUS is not offended with me) in this review, the <b>Sony VAIO</b> laptop I will compare with the <b>ASUS VX5 Lamborghini</b> laptop, about which I recently did a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/asus/blog/70632/">detailed review</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7c2/e63/48b/7c2e6348b4b1432d877412250d9ab52c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I think this is logical - the price category they have is the same, the weight, size and purpose are also similar.  Only here, in the first review, so often they said, ‚Äú <i>oh well nafig, vayo is much better,</i> ‚Äù so I even wonder what they will say this time.  I feel that the storm in the glass will calm down only after I do reviews of the latest MacBooks) <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/apple/72913/">By the way</a> ) <br><br>  So let's see ... what is your VAIO and how much better is it? That's it, let's not pull the cat by the tail - let's go. <br><br><h2>  Equipment </h2><br>  The box surprised me.  This is not some kind of boxing in which it would not be a shame to give a laptop ... this is the most common cardboard.  With a complete set just the same trouble - for a laptop with a space cost, they did not bother to put either a mouse or a leather bag - nothing.  I really hope that this problem is only a sample that I got, and not the whole batch ... otherwise it's just not serious. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/99a/9e3/c9f/99a9e3c9f7792ee22e46933a4d857446.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In the box was: <br><br>  - <b>VAIO VGN-AW2XRY / Q laptop</b> ; <br>  - Battery; <br>  - Remote control; <br>  - AC adapter with power cable; <br>  - Adapter to a laptop for a TV antenna; <br>  - Quick Installation Guide and some other paper. <br><br>  The battery is Li-Ion at 4800mAh (11.1V, 58Wh).  Instructions, as such, in paper form, too, no - instead, only the black-and-white Russian-Ukrainian quick installation guide.  The manual itself was later found in electronic form - a detailed and useful thing.  The network adapter is big and heavy, I hope that at least it is of high quality) There were no complaints about it during the work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3ac/8ee/759/3ac8ee759b12ede3c28631d6df1b82d8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  Appearance </h2><br>  First, let's talk about the remote.  Here I am also somewhat disappointed ... so someone who, and Sony should have done beautifully!  Here is the most common console of cheap plastic, in which there is almost nothing remarkable.  Compare it at least with the remote controls (from the TV and popcorn) of BBK, which for some reason, many people dislike, even if they have never seen its products. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d9e/c41/0a7/d9ec410a70abf15e96695f9717d7b280.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/510/44a/10b/51044a10bbbf28a47aa60218516f0ddc.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c5d/78d/ca4/c5d78dca45b02affc82d3a5603a5b72b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I think comments are unnecessary) There are a lot of buttons on the remote, but in terms of functionality it is very standard.  The brightest button, round with the Windows logo, allows you to launch a Windows MCE (Media Center Edition) shell on a laptop.  An extremely nice thing, you can read about it on the Internet (I partially also wrote). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5de/5b0/362/5de5b0362930ae7ad0995f1b04a1f1bb.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Now you can talk about the laptop itself) It is just huge (437x289x36.9 / 39.7mm) - it didn't fit into any of the notebook bags that were on hand.  Therefore, without a bag in the kit it is doubly bad - not in the Ashanov package to carry it.  Weight - almost 4 kilograms.  But as a reward for physical exhaustion - a screen diagonal of 18.4 inches. <br>  For comparison, ASUS VX5 weighed 3.3kg with dimensions of 394x2274x48mm and a diagonal of 16.4 ‚Äùand the‚Äú strong men ‚Äùwere beginning to be indignant already on this note) <br><br>  The laptop is really beautiful - here you can not argue.  His appearance immediately inspires some confidence ... one feels that they have carefully thought over and worked on many details.  But not over all.  For example, the front cover is made of black glossy plastic (there is no rag to remove prints in the kit), it is just like all glossy surfaces. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/41a/643/5f5/41a6435f58ef954b38cd2d8ae096fa54.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9cc/4d8/51c/9cc4d851c55dea30be456384b7b9ebec.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Inside, the gloss is much less - although it calms.  Gloss can for marketing and good, but in practice it is continuous inconvenience. <br><br>  I liked the variety of connectors that are present on the body of this machine, which makes it very versatile.  On the left side there are ventilation holes, a USB port, a VGA and HDMI connector, a card reader for CF cards, an ExpressCard slot and an S400 connector (I meet for the first time). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/04a/824/e67/04a824e67de236f534930f4651195744.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the right is the Bluray drive, two more USB ports, an optical output jack and a microphone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c84/84a/f52/c8484af5269f26d44060d707f77eccce.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  A little later, a small flip-up plug was found behind the drive - behind it is a 100-megabit network connector, an antenna hole and ... a telephone cable.  Yes, yes, inside there is a modem v.92 56K ........) If there was no SSD disk inside, I would have thought that I had made a wrong choice with a laptop at least for an era. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/66d/a83/a76/66da83a76f70f42c9fcf3621559d6a08.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  If you look at the laptop from the front, you can see the following functional elements - two slots for memory cards (SD and Memory Stick), an IR receiver window and a Wi-Fi switch (Off-on). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/002/a5c/a6d/002a5ca6d7cd298977eb7f5b89a30cbe.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c5c/533/6fb/c5c5336fb19894b9900a4a66edb67f7b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Just below it all (even at the bottom of the laptop) is the MagicGate connector cover, which is quite difficult to open (there is nothing to catch on).  Judging by the tooltip when typing a search query in Yandex "magic gate what is", I'm not alone)) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ae0/db6/652/ae0db6652c03eec29a7f924715d2eca1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  There is nothing behind, except a little battery. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/586/e54/04b/586e5404bb465bec7d83811d7a63a6ac.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  A solid metallic chrome ‚Äúribbon‚Äù of the molding goes on all the ends, on which in some places explanatory signs are inscribed above the ports. <br>  On the "bottom" - a few ventilation holes, three small round rubber feet and two large high, and the latter can not be removed.  It would be better to have done both on keyboards, as well as extra half centimeters of growth. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1ae/dda/c53/1aeddac530a38a28567de371edcf5c58.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/87f/c67/7b0/87fc677b057504200e842d052ef5b27d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The two parts of the laptop are connected by a massive hinge, from one end of which there is a power connector, on the other - a transparent power button.  The hinge holds the screen perfectly, it opens and closes without sound, does not falter and, in general, seemed to me very reliable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/756/c14/55f/756c1455fcafe6f0142af25858c1e813.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7f7/408/282/7f7408282b899cef025ce363ed2f0285.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The screen is not glossy and not matte - something in between.  I liked him very much, we must take an example from him.  Apparently, for this screen there are so many card slots on the case, so that photographers can really admire their pictures;) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/501/5c2/b3e/5015c2b3e3186041541ade5be0ab989a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ece/e35/2df/ecee352dfc39b09992c1186498b0e989.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The frame around the screen is matte - finally.  On top of it is a webcam with 1.3 megapixels on board.  By the way, they are also interpolated. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a25/1de/8e6/a251de8e6da9d3a7b6f0f7f0a298edbf.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Immediately below the screen is a fine grid, behind which are located 2.1-speakers.  In this grid, a panel with seven touch buttons is inserted and a fingerprint scanner is a nice bonus. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9c7/749/842/9c7749842f1adddd9349e7a22056b837.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b74/af6/b50/b74af6b50603c0f81bb45b3e938b74e7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The keyboard is ‚Äúlike a VAIO‚Äù - in principle, in the best traditions) But in this particular case I did not like it in part with its layout.  The small right Shift and Enter are like on the VX5, but there is still a digital block, due to which these buttons (especially the Del at the top) in the dark cannot be distinguished.  Therefore, to send a message in ICQ or a comment, CTRL + Enter will have to search.  But for some reason they made (on the keyboard) a hardware button for opening the drive, a very nice bonus, which can come in handy by chance while watching a movie from a disk. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e95/5c5/d83/e955c5d8387ea6f3be82ae0c00e7c8b0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Otherwise ... everything is not bad.  Split square keys with rounded edges, quiet and tactilely pleasant keystrokes, a small keystroke ... for complete happiness, I would like to highlight - in the same VX5 it just is. <br><br>  The touchpad without any frills - the most common rectangular (with rounded edges) touchpad.  Rough, with a dotted texture, not pressed into the main part of the body.  It‚Äôs nice to work with fingers, I haven‚Äôt tried anything else) There is a scroll area on the right, but it is not marked in any way (maybe for the best).  But the fact that there is no multisensory, can upset some.  Under the touchpad two elastic buttons. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f01/8e8/446/f018e8446d02bc568710ca05eca77616.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I forgot an important point) Immediately after opening the "book", the material that covered the surface under the keyboard rushed into the eyes (and around the touchpad, respectively).  At first it seemed to me that it was leather (for such a price it should be at least the skin of the president of Venezuela), but the very first touch (and even if you just peer into the texture) said that it was not even leatherette.  This is just a rubberized surface. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cff/d0b/350/cffd0b350afb7aa60c5615e260ae0685.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Very pleasant to the touch and, I hope, practical, coverage ... but damn ... where are the chips then that SO influence the pricing?  :) Well, if the filling does not disappoint - deliberately removed the specifications to the bottom) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a49/994/8cc/a499948cc011e0da84d35c44b28f8bac.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  Turn on and work </h2><br>  Switching on is done by pressing the button on the right side - right after that it lights up in green, like a small diode strip in the hinge.  The light green buttons on the front of the touch buttons are lit ‚Äî so unobtrusively, pleasantly.  It‚Äôs impossible to call a device quiet - it is clearly audible in silence, but in an office setting you don‚Äôt pay much attention to it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/809/b73/ec1/809b73ec1509ee79c78c1a0162553cc4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In the VX5, many have scolded the heat removal system - they say that it‚Äôs generally for such cuts in the side of the device ... well then) Here are exactly the same cuts, only they ‚Äúwarm‚Äù not only to the side, but also downwards (thanks to the beveled part of the bottom ).  If you put a laptop on your knees and put a resource-intensive film, then the first discomfort will appear even before ‚Äústarring‚Äù.  So the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/72222/">stand</a> was very helpful. <br><br>  The driving out tray does not rest on the surface under it - it‚Äôs a frequent pitfall, you have to be careful. <br><br>  After starting the system, there are a lot of shortcuts on the desktop - you can restore order.  On the software a little lower. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/57f/cc8/957/57fcc895715545a78df9af4a888a587a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Battery life, oh gods, is exactly 1 hour. <br><br><h2>  Performance </h2><br>  With this indicator, everything seems fine.  The <b>Mobile Intel¬Æ PM45 Express</b> chipset is equipped with an <b>Intel¬Æ Core ‚Ñ¢ 2 Duo T9800 processor</b> with a clock frequency of <b>2.93 GHz</b> ( <b>1066 MHz</b> bus frequency, 6MB L2 cache) - one of the best stones in the Core2Duo line (above only <s>the</s> T9900 <s>star</s> with 3.06 GHz).  On board - 4GB of RAM (DDR2, 800 MHz) and a discrete <b>NVIDIA GeForce 9600M GT graphics card</b> with 512MB of memory.  This alignment allows you to achieve good performance, sufficient for most tasks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/125/02d/76e/12502d76e06506b47018630dc3388a46.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/128/b06/57e/128b0657eb95d489491fe54aa3e8d92f.png" alt="image"><br><br>  All kinds of movies - absolutely no problem.  Games - the installed <b>Crysis was</b> freely launched and even gave a tolerable play, however, far from the maximum settings and even not at high.  Something more objective can say synthetic tests that are used to measure ... measure) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e2c/660/f26/e2c660f26d25f46f53d66aa8ab08297f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  So, after disabling everything unnecessary from services and applications in the tray, I launch the <b>SuperPi 1.5</b> program.  The number of "Pi" to a million mark is <b>22</b> seconds, which is not bad. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/52b/22e/2af/52b22e2afc110a4c9e665ca82645f72e.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Math test <b>CPU FreeBenchmark 2.2</b> ends already after <b>23.14</b> seconds - it is even a bit faster than in Lambo. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0e1/3a3/f64/0e13a3f64bd1716ce30b53d9438f31c9.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>3DMark05</b> at a resolution of 1024x768 (without AA) scored <b>10573</b> points, <b>3DMark06</b> at a resolution of 1280x1024 - <b>5275</b> .  Slightly lag. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/36a/158/209/36a15820935fd173b2585e92350260ca.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/91c/bf3/66a/91cbf366ab1f30c8b9b796321ed857aa.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>3DMarkVantage 1.0.1</b> - scored <b>P1718</b> points on the Performance profile (GPU - <b>1390</b> , CPU - <b>6889</b> ), and on the High profile - <b>H911</b> (GPU - <b>793</b> , CPU - <b>5702</b> ). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/897/065/eb4/897065eb456c55191d4033bf55ef7fa5.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Actually, such pies) no brakes were found.  Oh yeah, the installed Windows Vista Ultimate system gave a performance index of <b>5.5</b> - like on a sports car. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7e1/7cf/b2d/7e17cfb2d10b671e47615891887a6c53.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Now you can talk about another nice thing, although, as I understand it, there are two of them at once. <br>  The total amount of space for the data on this laptop is 628GB - to a 500GB hard drive, two SSD disks of 64GB each (with support for Raid 0) came to help.  And here I have a few questions.  The first and foremost of which is ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù.  Silent system here it seems like it was not designed.  Judging by the weight and size, the device is also not intended for active travels (as a last resort, you can stuff a flash drive with a flash drive).  A multimedia laptop is supposed to store a lot of content, however, 128GB is a bit at all ... I would even say it‚Äôs only 3 films in blur) Okay, we‚Äôll assume that this bundle will please with its performance, for example, in the OS ... but I assure - The target audience of this notebook will not even know about it.  SSD is, of course, good, but it‚Äôs not at all clear what the manufacturer was guided by. <br>  Tolley case from ASUS VX5) There is a choice of either an array of two disks per total terabyte, or the same (!!!) volume completely on the SSD, but for thousands more.  To whom that is necessary, he chooses, and no problems. <br><br>  Nevertheless, SSDs in Soni VAIO proved to be very worthy.  Judge for yourself - a graph of linear reading speed and random access time. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2b5/b70/f31/2b5b70f312dbb8328e86429e00acbcf8.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c44/49c/1f1/c4449c1f1eddc622d8c8acf3bd03b3e7.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ba7/340/294/ba7340294dfc0b5f47d412604692dbb8.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e08/26e/297/e0826e29703a507199f75ef334fce0b9.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The usual hard disk is not famous for records - there was no more than 50 MB / c. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c13/b0c/e9d/c13b0ce9d2ab30d78e98cab42012d99a.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d76/fde/153/d76fde153dcc3db110d197493934e9c0.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e76/941/1c3/e769411c35ff9735767464f20ff83c23.png" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  Software </h2><br>  In many ASUS reviews, I skip this chapter, because often the software just repeats from device to device - I only write about innovations.  But I would like to stop at Sonya in detail - for many there will not be anything new, but I personally was pleased to meet you. <br><br>  So, right after launch, a small window is visible on the desktop - ‚Äú <b>Me and my VAIO</b> ‚Äù.  When you click on it, a large window opens where the main actions based on the main software are placed.  It is necessary, for example, to work with the photo - select the desired item and see the available actions.  Sort, burn, edit, etc.  - select, for example, "Edit" and immediately become available programs for editing.  In the specific case of <b>Photoshop Elements</b> and <b>Picture Motion Browser</b> .  And so by analogy.  In fact, such a launcher is very convenient and will appeal to people other than geeks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/42e/300/3c8/42e3003c8559318f2c5bc0dfc8cdce44.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6e4/2c9/068/6e42c9068c02385aea8e3df95e3e8a3e.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The <b>VAIO Smart Network</b> utility is also not superfluous - starting up with the operating system, it hangs unobtrusively right under the webcam.  Allows you to very detailed configure network settings and connections, create a couple of profiles for quick switching. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a62/5b3/2e0/a625b32e0d0b512e21571b3a87ddcaa3.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/136/e6c/9d8/136e6c9d8397d01ab60986e2d7ca0c79.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The third-party program <b>ArcSoft WebCam Companion</b> is responsible for the work of the webcam (more and more I start to love ArcSoft - they do a lot of things and at a good level).  There may not be as many <b>settings</b> as in <b>ASUS LifeFrame</b> , but also a lot of things.  Of the unusual, I liked the fact that instead of myself I could show some character who will partially repeat your actions.  lol. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e93/1cd/fbf/e931cdfbfb6030f7ba936e36c8be403c.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9b6/c63/700/9b6c63700fab1d939a50062c92d8af1d.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The fingerprint sensor is also a nice bonus - I always liked it because you can log in quickly.  Immediately besides the login, there are several other functions - encryption, launching applications, <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a8b/d51/2c2/a8bd512c2d4d325da864be9664f03f2f.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1b7/79a/fa7/1b779afa71dfc0e79df0dfb0dfcf4f6b.png" alt="image"><br><br>  As a separate item, I liked the <b>PMB</b> ( <b>Picture Motion Browser</b> ) program mentioned above.  Thanks to it, you can really very quickly and conveniently sort the photos - use a sheer pleasure. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/263/6be/620/2636be620db0a1ab5eddc0e7db9dd7db.png" alt="image"><br><br>  As I said, there are touch buttons above the keyboard - in addition to the player control buttons, there are two buttons <b>S1</b> and <b>S2</b> . <br>  The first, S1, launches the <b>Sony Center</b> - a kind of laptop control panel.  I really liked this tool, because everything is collected in one place.  What all"?  General system information (nothing superfluous), power management settings (very flexible), display settings (or displays), sound, security, and keyboard buttons.  Well done, very nice soft. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2dc/c32/2d8/2dcc322d8a01dc0555c4bc03e3fd8083.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/165/8c1/f04/1658c1f044ac1a26058bbe4c0b74bccc.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/af3/304/ecf/af3304ecf55244b81ce4040dbc3818ec.png" alt="image"><br><br>  When you press S2, the <b>Dolby Control Center</b> is launched by default - a small window with a pseudo three-dimensional room where you can change the bass level by moving the single slider) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bf4/c29/071/bf4c2907144fe067ded2251908b5bc23.png" alt="image"><br><br>  In general, it is hardly useful to anyone, so you can immediately perebindit. <br><br>  In general, I liked the software - not too much, and what is - hidden.  It is not difficult to find and who will have enough regular functionality - they will appreciate it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e2e/20c/cd2/e2e20ccd222553fb57f931c92094ccd2.png" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  Check weighing </h2><br>  <u>pros</u> <br>  - Stylish appearance and expensive finishing materials, high-quality assembly; <br>  - High performance, many different connectors; <br>  - Bright and colorful screen, fingerprint scanner; <br>  - Comfortable keyboard with split keys; <br>  - SSD-disk, Bluray-drive, remote control. <br>  - With software everything is OK) <br><br>  <u>Minuses</u> <br>  - Scanty equipment; <br>  - Huge size and weight; <br>  - Glossy cover is very marking; <br>  - Ugly remote, sometimes uncomfortable layout (you can get used to), there is no backlight; <br>  - Not the most successful design for heat dissipation; <br>  - A short battery life; <br>  - Price (100,000 rubles). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e0f/15c/2ba/e0f15c2ba507141b791660683310c720.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  Total </h2><br>  Do not say anything, I understand everything) ‚Äú <i>nafig laptop XXX, better vaio!</i>  "In 99% of the cases, it means that they mean the X, Z, TT or SR series - stylish, small, powerful and expensive cars that are really cool.  But ... it seems to me that most often it is said by those who cannot afford either one or the other, but want to say something.  Friends, you need to be easier) Well, or at least specify - it seems, Sonya Sonya.  Hence the title of the article - taking the opportunity to take the "top" model, and in it damn so many compromises. <br>  At one time, I slightly asked myself the question of studying the lineup of Sony laptops and I know that the AW series is positioned as a multimedia one, in fact it is even a DTR system (Desktop Replace).  And here it is worth nodding your head - the multimedia capabilities of the laptop discourage one hundred percent.  But then I, all the more, do not understand the claims to the VX5, which is lighter, longer-playing and, in my opinion, more aggressive-sympathetic) He can do the same thing + you can take it with you.  If I hadn‚Äôt written about VX5, this article would probably be in a more positive way, because there wouldn‚Äôt be a comparison and everything would seem more unique.  And no ‚Äú <i>ASUS will not allow writing</i> ‚Äù has nothing to do with it.  Nevermind.  I do not impose either this or that. <br>  In general, the laptop made a positive impression - everything in it is harmoniously assembled, thought out and debugged, although there are a lot of controversial issues (one modem is worth something).  BUT ... judging more globally - there is absolutely nothing in it to cost 100 thousand.  In my opinion, for such a configuration, the price is almost doubled. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/500/49c/855/50049c8555b0c0d9543e5bd5a46af302.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  There was very little time for the test, so if I didn‚Äôt figure it out (and this is the place to be), then do not swear, but supplement.
