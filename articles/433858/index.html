Of course, this does not mean that one report is much worse than another: if you change the calculation method, places can easily change.  In reality, we changed it, now the ‚Äúsoft quorum‚Äù version of the rating is used, taking into account the number of participants present at the report.  This approach has its drawbacks (for example, more people come to the keyout than to the regular report, simply because the audience has no choice), but in general it gives a better picture of what happened. </p><br><p>  Under the cut - and videos of the best reports, and links to their presentations, and short descriptions, and a link to the full playlist. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ku/k1/k_/kuk1k_wsg4vrndfivljkjsyxmfa.jpeg"></p><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1 id="polnyy-pleylist">  Full playlist </h1><br><p>  The full playlist with all the videos that will be discussed below is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist%3Flist%3DPLVe-2wcL84b9CC4_PMCxQrDYywz7J0beo%26disable_polymer%3Dtrue">available here</a> . </p><br><h1 id="10-linux-container-performance-tools-for-jvm-applications">  10.

Nevertheless, Java has always had some problems and peculiarities with it, which will be discussed in the report of Sasha Goldstein. </p><br><p>  Sasha is a serial creator of performance hardcore.  Last year at JPoint, he gave a great talk about using the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D0qI31tdlV-k">Berkeley Packet Filter for JVM</a> (I desperately recommend watching the recording on YouTube), and it was only a matter of time before he gets to the detailed containerization parsing.  The world goes to the clouds and dockers, which in turn brings us many new problems.  As you can see, most low-level debugging and profiling systems after their application to containers are overgrown with various features and jambs.  Sasha skated around the main scenarios (CPU loading, IO responsiveness, access to shared databases, etc.) through the prism of using modern tools on the GNU / Linux platform, including BCC and perf. </p><br><p>  This specificity is needed not by all.  This is one of the reasons why the report was only in tenth place - it was attended by about two hundred people (compare with more than a thousand from Tolkachev and Borisov), and our rating calculation algorithm is very sensitive to the size of the audience. </p><br><p>  For those who are somehow connected with containers, this report is a must-see.  Save a lot of time on an independent search for all the details using the method of complete enumeration of the countless number of utilities and ways to use them. </p><br><p>  I would also like to note that Sasha‚Äôs report out of all the top 10 is almost the densest in terms of the amount of practical information per unit of time.  Almost every slide you can copy yourself some useful things.  In order not to engage in a detailed retelling, I will show only the surface structure of the presentation: </p><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Report outline</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><ul><li>  How are containers arranged? <br><ul><li>  Control groups: CPU, memory, block I / O; </li><li>  Namespaces: pid namespace, mount namespace, network namespace; </li></ul></li><li>  The difference between the problems: <br><ul><li>  On the host; </li><li>  In the container; </li><li>  Examples of problems with solutions: <br><ul><li>  Connect to JVM? </li><li>  Performance data JVM? </li></ul></li><li>  Demo of JVM tools on the host; </li></ul></li><li>  Resource information tools: <br><ul><li>  sidecar for monitoring; </li><li>  docker stats; </li><li>  systemd-cgtop; </li><li>  htop + cgroup ID; </li><li>  nsenter or docker exec; </li><li>  Container resource demo; </li></ul></li><li>  CPU container profiling: <br><ul><li>  perf on the host: -G, symbol mapping, PID mapping, sharing perf map (perf-map-agent); </li><li>  Demo with flamegraphs;  oos; </li><li>  perf in a container in unprivileged mode; </li><li>  honest-profiler, async-profiler, perf vs async-profiler; </li><li>  Demo async-profiler; </li><li>  BCC is a profiling tool (it solves a number of problems on its own, but it only works on Linux 4.9+); </li><li>  Throttling; </li></ul></li><li>  Other ways to monitor: <br><ul><li>  cAdvisor, SysDig, New Relic, DataDog ... </li></ul></li></ul></div></div><br><h1 id="9-odin-raz-v-god-sady-cvetut-razbor-semantiki-exactly-once-apache-kafka">  9.

This is the man who released nearly two hundred issues of the podcast Debriefing, the author of a heap of reports, texts, posts and even the book ‚ÄúEnterprise Web Development‚Äù of O'Reilly.  The very presence of Gamow makes anything better.  I am sure he could, with the same intonation, tell not about Kafka, but about the growth of geranium on the window sill, and it would still be fascinating. </p><br><p>  Here we have a special case: initially holivornaya topic about the semantics of "exactly once".  Kafka was rushed to use everything on an extraordinary scale, which required reworking the traditional semantics of message delivery.  Kafka didn‚Äôt put a finger in his mouth - they pereobulsya on the go under the correct protocol and message format and did everything you need.  Throughout the report, Victor tells how it works inside and what it affects. </p><br><p>  Two news, good and bad.  Good: in Kafka, everything is configured.  The bad: in Kafka everything is set up.  To live with this, you need to understand how it works and where to climb with your dirty hands. </p><br><p>  You could expect some kind of smoothie from Viktor, but then you got a desperate hardcore, and something like this: </p><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Report outline</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><ul><li>  Introduction to Kafka: <br><ul><li>  Topics </li><li>  Partitions </li><li>  Logs and offsets </li><li>  Replicas and Leaders </li><li>  Customers: Producers and Consumers </li></ul></li><li>  Producer <br><ul><li>  How it works on examples </li><li>  Producer protocol </li></ul></li><li>  Consumer <br><ul><li>  How it works on examples </li><li>  Consumer Protocol </li></ul></li><li>  Processing model <br><ul><li>  Read, count, write </li><li>  Types of failures (everything broke, zombies) </li></ul></li><li>  Processing semantics <br><ul><li>  At-least-once, at-most-once, exactly-once </li></ul></li><li>  The semantics "exactly once" <br><ul><li>  With examples </li><li>  Weakness <br><ul><li>  unsafe replays </li><li>  non-atomic record with offset </li><li>  zombie </li></ul></li></ul></li><li>  We fix the first weakness: idempotent producer </li><li>  We fix the second weakness: <br><ul><li>  Chandy Lampport Snapshots <br><ul><li>  Principle </li><li>  How to live malfunctioning? <br><ul><li>  Hard: crash during processing </li><li>  Soft: fail before or during snapshot removal </li></ul></li></ul></li><li>  Transactions in Kafka <br><ul><li>  Two types of markers (COMMIT, ABORT) </li><li>  Atomic writing to multiple partitions (Including! _Consumer_offsets) </li></ul></li></ul></li><li>  Fix third weakness: zombie fencing </li><li>  Isolation of reading at the bureau </li><li>  end-to-end eos <br><ul><li>  Kafka Connect Source </li><li>  Kafka streams </li><li>  Kafka Connect Sink </li></ul></li></ul></div></div><br><h1 id="8-boremsya-s-russian-hackers-s-pomoschyu-kafka-streams-i-firehose-api">  8.

Again Gamov!  Yes, and with Baruch Sadogursky ( <a href="https://habr.com/users/jbaruch/" class="user_link">jbaruch</a> ) now.  Nevertheless, this report is not a smoothie, but a very concrete practical thing about how on the Bintray platform (of which Baruch is the god) using Apache Kafka (for which Victor is responsible) and Firehose analyze behavioral patterns, process large amounts of data. </p><br><p>  If the previous report about Kafka's insides had 245 slides, then this one is only 17. That's because you need to watch it!  This is primarily a lively dialogue between the leading and live demos.  Do not linger, open vidosik and look. </p><br><h1 id="7-apparatnaya-tranzakcionnaya-pamyat-v-java">  7.

His report contrasts strongly with the ‚ÄúRussian hackers‚Äù, because it‚Äôs not a light entertaining read, but a story about the intricate insides of a VM.  If you look at the <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/oxjq45e8ilak/6NuXQpuOnSmCco0y206ysc/9714ac8347ba5f64762bd1cd5f12ab8a/Nikita_Koval_HTM_in_Java.pdf">slides</a> , you can find 150 sheets, most of which are code. </p><br><p>  If you were on JBreak in the beginning of 2018, you could find Nikita‚Äôs story about completely different things - writing a fast multi-threaded hash table using the power of modern multi-core architectures and special algorithms.  Agree, Nikita has a <em>style</em> .  I immediately recall Shipilev. </p><br><p>  This time we will talk about transactional memory, which gradually appears in modern processors, but which is still not clear how to use an ordinary person from the JVM world.  Outside the JVM, of course, everything is easier.  But imagine how you tell the usual Spring web developer: "Yes, you just edit the vmstructs, load your intrinsics, rebuild OpenJDK and you're done!"  And he said: "Well, of course, I do it every day!".  Nikita just very clearly talks about how to use it, what optimization already exists in OpenJDK and how to perform transactions directly from Java code. </p><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Report outline</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><ul><li>  Introduction: Why we need multithreading </li><li>  Approaches to the construction of algorithms <br><ul><li>  Rough lock </li><li>  Slim lock </li><li>  Non-blocking sync </li><li>  All three types are illustrated on an example task about a toy bank. </li></ul></li><li>  Multithreading is hard.

Interestingly, before taking up the low-latency code in Java, he worked at Intel as a performance engineer of compilers for C / C ++ / FORTRAN languages.  This report also has a perf!  :-) There is also about the hardware features of the processors and Intel Processor Trace technology, which allows you to take the next step in the accuracy of profiling and to reconstruct the execution of the program section.  There are quite a few such reports (for example, you can find <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DR0AlpLqhwPQ">the Andi Kleen report</a> at the Tracing Summit 2015), they usually leave a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DR0AlpLqhwPQ">lot of</a> questions and do not shine with practicality in relation to Java.

On the past Joker, he had a little less than a thousand people - a record in terms of audience size on a regular non-keyout report.  In this he is helped by a decade of experience in virtual machines and the ability to explain technical hardcore so that it can be repeated in practice. </p><br><p>  Many people do not quite understand why digging into a virtual machine if you have a regular application on a computer, with a database and everything is as it should be.  In this report, there is a good argument at the level of "how to understand which query will pull a lot of data?"  If you try to instrument the code with the help of JMX, then something strange is happening with the performance.  First, it is possible to understand why this is happening, and secondly, what can be done with it.  In my opinion, this report is valuable not so much as a set of tools (although there is a little about helfy), as a demonstration of the correct mindsets developer OpenJDK and how to behave in difficult situations.  It says the existence and explanation of the specific things like TLAB, Code Cache, Constant Pool, etc. </p><br><h1 id="4-korutiny-v-kotlin">  4.

Roman talked about specific things - what, how and why in the design of korutin, and how to use it, and I need it to improve my programming skills on Kotlin.  Here, Andrew ( <a href="https://habr.com/users/abreslav/" class="user_link">abreslav</a> ) tells things that improve knowledge of life in general and give an understanding of their place in the world.  If you have seen all these languages ‚Äã‚Äãwith your own eyes - Java, C #, Scala, Groovy, Python, Gosu - this is even more interesting, because there is a reason for discussion (conference visitors probably could have taken the opportunity and really discussed their understanding of things live in the discussion area ).

The stars came together in the right order, and two top speakers appeared on the scene with a wealth of experience and practice in conducting paired reports to discuss an interesting topic for both of them.  Why I emphasize it this way - usually, viewers have no idea what the creation of such a presentation is worth, and take everything for granted. </p><br><p>  But the result justified the investment.  Judge for yourself, this is an evening keyout, the most recent report of the conference, during which people are already exhausted by two days of tin, they want to sleep, someone needs to fly home right now and so on.  And yet, in the hall there are more than 600 people for sure. </p><br><p>  This is not a reference report, but a report-show, you need to watch it.  In it, Holmes and Watson will uncover several riddles that you have encountered, encountered or will encounter in everyday development.  There will be no gutters of garbage collectors and bytecode, but there will be tools, libraries and frameworks that perplex ordinary developers in their daily routines, leading to downtime, dead footing and prolonged depressions.  In fact, in this report, Sherlock and Watson save your forehead from the facepalm and the rake, which someone has already attacked. </p><br><p>  Therefore, the summary content here again will not be - just start the video and watch. </p><br><h1 id="1-boot-yourself-spring-is-coming">  1. Boot yourself, Spring is coming </h1><br><p>  ‚Üí <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/lavcraft/boot-yourself-spring-is-coming">Download slides</a> </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UYre4_bytD4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wQcZK0Tln30" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><p>  Baruch + Gamov, Baruch + Borisov, who is missing among the authors of the popular pair reports?  That's right, Borisov + Tolkachev ( <a href="https://habr.com/users/tolkkv/" class="user_link">tolkkv</a> ).  Another cool report that, not being a keyout, gathered a record number of participants - more than a thousand.  The material turned out to be so much, and it is so interesting that they allocated as many as two slots in the conference program - and you‚Äôll have to watch two whole videos on YouTube, respectively. </p><br><p>  Many years ago, Java programmers used ‚Äúnew‚Äù to create services.  They did a lot of manual actions and mixed configuration with business logic.  They even used copy-paste techniques.  It was written many lines of poor code, which at times even worked. </p><br><p>  Then Spring appeared.  With him, much has changed ... We got a lot of "magic" from the magic cylinder of Spring, and our code has become more clean, simple and maintained. </p><br><p>  And there was Spring Boot.  On the one hand, it solves thousands of previously existing problems: version conflicts, configuration tasks, work with infrastructure bins, the problem of setting up the environment and, of course, launching or deploying the application, including building jar / war archives.  On the other hand, Spring Boot added even more magic to our magic cylinder.  As a result, there are two scenarios: </p><br><ul><li>  Everything works great, although no one knows how. </li><li>  Nothing works, and no one knows why. </li></ul><br><p>  This report reveals the basic secrets of Spring Boot magic.  You understand the basic principles and conventions by which typical Spring Boot applications work.  The task of Cyril and Eugene is that all the magic from the cylinder turns into a much more transparent process for you and you can not only have fun when everything works, but also understand the essence of the problems that arise and can solve them without using ambulance and other services available urgent calls. </p><br><h1 id="zaklyuchenie">  Conclusion </h1><br><p>  It took me a few days to watch all the videos from the list.  It was not easy, but it is clear that it was worth it.  In reality, there were much more reports at the conference, and watching the top ten of them is a good start for a much larger way.  If you also watch these reports - do not be lazy to write your reviews in the comments on Habr√©! </p><br><blockquote>  Meanwhile, it is already possible to purchase tickets for the next JPoint.  It will be held April 5-6, 2019 at the WTC Congress Center.
