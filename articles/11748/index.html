  <section class="page js-page"><h1>QSOFT offers a new service in the web development market</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  QSOFT, a leading Russian Web integrator, announced the launch of a new service in the web development market - a comprehensive technical audit of sites created on the basis of 1C-Bitrix: Site Management. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Website audit - the service for Runet is not new, but so far has been limited to proposals for search engine optimization aimed at ensuring the promotion of the project and increasing its attendance.  And only a few companies offered their customers a superficial analysis of the usability of the resource, which often boiled down to optimizing the appearance of the pages.  But the technical side of the issue, on which the viability of any project depends, has remained in the shadows until this point. <br><br>  During the creation of the site, the developers, trying to take into account all the wishes of the client, do not always follow the rules and standards defined by Bitrix for the integration of projects with the system, and do not fully reflect the results of their work in the project documentation.  And after the end of development, throughout the entire existence of the project, the structure of the site and its elements undergoes constant transformations, which is connected, first of all, with the owner‚Äôs desire to make their resource more practical and convenient for users.  But, unfortunately, such changes are not always carried out correctly and not in the best way affect the functioning of the site as a whole: because of the tight deadlines, the code is written in a hurry - ‚Äújust to work‚Äù, proper testing is not performed, and the result suffers all elements and spoils the overall impression of the project. <br><br>  In order to help owners of sites based on 1C-Bitrix: Site Management to avoid system failures that are fraught for owners with significant loss of effort, time and money, QSOFT offered its customers a new service - a technical audit.  It allows you to make sure that the integration of the site was carried out correctly and correctly, that switching to a new version of 1C-Bitrix and / or another DBMS will not affect the viability of the resource, that moving to another hosting or updating the server software will pass without problems and will cause problems with the project.  Assessing the status of project documentation, checking the quality of integration and analyzing the settings of the modules makes it possible to determine how effectively the 1C-Bitrix features and server hardware resources are used on the site, that the 1C-Bitrix functionality is not compromised due to the short development time, that the design documentation corresponds to reality, etc.
