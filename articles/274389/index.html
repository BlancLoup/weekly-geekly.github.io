He confirms the high competence of the company in building cloud platforms that meet international standards and creating world-class cloud services. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b37/213/a53/b37213a534334af67cb1ab48dbabf9d4.png" width="300"><br><br>  This is the next step in the development of the company's cloud strategy.  Within the framework of this program, Infobox will offer high-quality, reliable and productive services based on Microsoft technologies, created with its expert support.  Customers will be able to use our services from data centers located on the territory of the Russian Federation, such as <br><ul><li>  <a href="https://office24.ru/">cloud solutions to improve business productivity</a> (business class mail, unified communications and collaboration, telephony, CRM).  Services are based on Microsoft products, such as Microsoft Exchange Server, Microsoft SharePoint Server, Microsoft Lync Server, Microsoft Dynamics CRM; </li><li>  Russian cloud infrastructure (IaaS) based on the Azure Pack for medium and large businesses, built as part of a joint project of Infobox and Microsoft, developed with the participation of Microsoft Consulting Services architects, certified by Microsoft and verified by Huawei.  The launch of this solution will take place in 2016, very soon. </li></ul><br><br><h5>  <b>Best hosting in Russia according to the results of the Russian competition among Microsoft partners</b> </h5><br>  According to the results of the Russian competition among Microsoft partners, Infobox with the <a href="http://office24.ru/">Office24</a> solution was recognized as the best company in the ‚ÄúHosting‚Äù nomination, thereby confirming the best expertise in the field of IT solutions for businesses. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/50d/6c6/a79/50d6c6a79594ed027167cb3fed1e2b10.png" width="250"><br><br>  Office24 is the Russian equivalent of the Office 365 service from Microsoft and is a unified system for communications, combining mail, a corporate portal and a conference call.  Additionally, Infobox integrated Microsoft software solutions with a virtual PBX and offered telephony features to customers.  Thus, Infobox created a unique solution package, which is integrated into Office24.  Infobox customers received a complete set of services that covers all the needs of any company in terms of communications and collaboration, which will allow them to focus on business tasks, and not on the selection of individual services from different suppliers. <br><br><blockquote>  <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/5M4aiYnXuh/">Infobox on the red carpet.</a>  <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/5M4aiYnXuh/">People like Infobox over the world!</a>  <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/5M4aiYnXuh/">))) #infobox #microsoft # wpc2015 #hosting #cloud #usa #orlando</a> A video posted by Alexey Bakhtiarov (@alyabushe) on Jul 16, 2015 at 8:00 am PDT </blockquote><br><br>  The ceremonial awarding of Infobox and other winners of the Russian competition was held on July 16, 2015 in Orlando, USA, at the International Partner Conference Worldwide Partner Conference 2015. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f48/fed/f02/f48fedf02e0c9cdea8566a15810676af.jpg" width="800"><br><br>  Every year, Microsoft names the best partners in an international IT-solutions competition.  Along with the traditional international competition, a similar Russian competition is being held.  The winners of the local partnership competition were those companies that were able to demonstrate an innovative approach to doing business and creating solutions based on Microsoft technologies, and also used the advantages of working with Microsoft to search for new opportunities and promote their products on the market. <br><br>  <a href="http://news.microsoft.com/ru-ru/opredeleny-pobediteli-konkursa-partnerskih-reshenij-microsoft/">Microsoft Press Release &gt;&gt;</a> <br><br><h5>  <b>New InfoboxCloud Cloud Region: St. Petersburg!</b> </h5><br>  In 2015, we launched a new region of the Russian cloud infrastructure InfoboxCloud in our own data center in St. Petersburg!
