  <section class="page js-page"><h1>CodePlex is closing</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <i>This is not an April Fool's joke.</i> <br><br>  11 years after we created CodePlex, it's time to say goodbye.  We launched CodePlex in 2006 because we, like others in the industry, saw the need for a great place to share software.  Over the years, we have seen a lot of great CodePlex counterparts, but at the moment GitHub is the de facto place to share open source files, and most open source projects have migrated there. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  We also migrated.  As many of you know, Microsoft has invested in Visual Studio Team Services of our ‚ÄúUnified Engineering System‚Äù for proprietary projects, and we have unveiled many of our key open source projects on GitHub (Visual Studio Code, TypeScript, .NET, Cognitive Toolkit and others ).  In fact, our organization at GitHub now has more than 16,000 open source developers ‚Äî more than any other organization ‚Äî and we are proud to work closely with GitHub to promote open source. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0ad/7b8/445/0ad7b8445146487caf33a005089c7136.png"></div><br>  Over the past few years, we have seen how many CodePlex projects have migrated.  During the same period, we had to tackle several issues, including the spam epidemic for several months in 2015, because spammers sought to use the CodePlex.com domain to enhance their illegal activities.  We are also seeing a significant reduction in usage: at the time of this writing, fewer than 350 projects have fixed source code in the last 30 days.

      <b>Outage plan</b> <br><br>  So, it's time to say goodbye to CodePlex.  At this point, we have disabled the ability to create new CodePlex projects.  In October, we will install only read-only mode in CodePlex before completely deactivating it on December 15, 2017. <br><br>  <b>Archive CodePlex</b> <br><br>  We will make a final full backup of the site before the closure and decommissioning of the existing site and CodePlex servers. <br><br>  CodePlex.com will begin to serve a read-only, lightweight archive that allows you to view all published projects ‚Äî their source code, downloads, documentation, licenses, and issues ‚Äî the way they looked when CodePlex switched to read-only mode.  You can also upload an archive file with the contents of your project, all entirely.  Where possible, we will create a redirect so that existing URLs work or at least redirect you to a new project page in the archive.  In addition, the archive will support the ‚ÄúI moved‚Äù setting, if you use it, to redirect users to the new home of your project. <br><br>  Currently, there is no end date for archive storage. <br><br>  <b>Data transfer</b> <br><br>  We offer two first-class ways to extract your data from CodePlex: <br><br>  First, we work with GitHub to provide simplified imports to help you bring the CodePlex source code, license, and documentation to GitHub.  The migration tool for issues is also in development and will be available soon - we will update <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/bharry/2017/03/31/shutting-down-codeplex/">this</a> blog post (as soon as such a tool is available).  In addition, we have added a new option to your project to install the ‚ÄúI have moved‚Äù banner, which will direct your users to the new home of your project.  A step-by-step guide in the <a href="https://aka.ms/codeplex-guide">CodePlex wiki</a> will guide you through the migration process. <br><br>  Secondly, the CodePlex archive will allow you to download the archive file as described above. <br><br>  If you want to transfer only the source code, you have many options depending on the type of your source code.  For Git users, many Git hostings, including Visual Studio Team Services and BitBucket, offer a simple data import that will help you transfer.  Bitbucket also offers imports for Mercurial users. <br><br>  <b>We are here to help</b> <br><br>  In the process of using these tools, CodePlex support can help by email.  GitHub is also ready to help if you have any problems with import. <br><br>  <i>Thank,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Brian</i> <br><br>  <b>PS</b> In the comments, the author of the post indicated that: It is not April fools joke.  (This is not an April Fool's joke), but on CodePlex a die appeared ‚ÄúCodePlex is shutting down.  Read about the shutdown plan, including Brian Harry's blog. "(" CodePlex closes. Read about the closure plan, including archive and migration information, on Brian Harry's blog ").  The text in the blog is also published March 31, 2017. <br><br>  <b>PPS</b> I specifically checked, when creating a new project, ‚Äúproject creation is disabled‚Äù pops up (‚Äúcreation of new projects is disabled‚Äù) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/325404/">https://habr.com/ru/post/325404/</a></p>
