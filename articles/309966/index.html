Provide a high level of performance and at the same time minimize the space occupied by the equipment will allow converged solution Dell PowerEdge FX. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a22/d46/841/a22d4684182546b184b321dee39a03cb.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  When it comes to data center infrastructure, every centimeter of free space is valuable, because you need to have a margin for future performance increases.  Increasing the density of computing power and storage can save not only space, but also reduce power consumption, cooling costs, number of ports, etc. However, not every organization is able to pull the acquisition of a full-sized blade solution.  In such cases, Dell PowerEdge FX comes to the rescue. <br><br><h3>  All inclusive </h3><br>  The new generation Dell PowerEdge FX platform is a 2U form factor case in which up to six Dell PowerEdge servers are installed, embedded modular data storage, as well as modules for connecting to external network resources (supporting redundancy of all connections), compatible with the FX2 chassis and supporting various workloads.  Equipped with built-in remote access and administration features, the Dell PowerEdge FX platform provides ease of setup, easy management, and on-demand capacity and computing capacity expansion, helping to form ready-made IT infrastructure blocks for performing tasks.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2c2/d77/ae8/2c2d77ae8ba646dd8c90d7165dfbfcff.jpg"><br><br>  The Dell PowerEdge FX converged architecture with shared power, input / output system, control, and built-in switching capabilities allows you to achieve a significant density of server resources: 40 dvuhsoketny servers occupy only 10U rack space.  Built on the 13th generation of Dell PowerEdge servers, PowerEdge FX2 includes advanced remote access and administration features that greatly simplify operations and data center management. <br><br><h3>  What's inside? </h3><br>  The converged FX architecture is based on server modules based on the latest Intel Xeon processors.  These include several models.  The FC430 is a two-processor, one-quarter wide, 1U wide server that provides high density.  Configuration of this model with InfiniBand is possible.  The FC630 heavy-duty, 1U heavy-duty dual-processor server module is ideal for a wide range of business applications.  A 4U full-width, 4-processor server with a 1U height is intended for data centers of medium-sized companies and large enterprises.  The set also includes a 1U FM120x4 half-width module, accommodating up to four separate single-processor servers based on Intel Atom processors.  Thus, up to 16 microservers can be installed in the FX2 2U case. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ede/342/6b9/ede3426b95734be0b292aef018ce9fdd.jpg"><br><br>  In addition, the Dell PowerEdge FX portfolio includes three new modules that offer businesses even more options optimized for specific business objectives.  This is the FD332 storage module, as well as the FC830 and FC430 servers.  They enable customers to add or change standard IT blocks in a single converged chassis in a 2U package. <br><br>  The PowerEdge FD332 block is a half-width data storage module that contains up to 16 small form factor (SFF) drives with direct connectivity and provides ultra-flexible, high-density scalable solutions.  Customers will be able to use up to 48 SFF disks in a 2U form factor based on the FX2 chassis.  FD332 in combination with PowerEdge FX allows customers to combine servers and storage systems of various configurations to support specific work requests. <br><br>  The one-processor, 1U width of a 1U form factor accommodates applications in small, physically discrete servers to minimize the risk of system errors.  It is equipped with Intel Xeon E5-2600 v3 processors and supports up to 8 DIMM memory modules.  The module comes in two versions - with one or two 1.8-inch SATA flash drives.  The dual disk configuration is suitable for core corporate workloads and distributed environments with a higher level of reliability.  The single-drive version has an InfiniBand port and is designed for applications with low latency levels, such as HPC calculations. <br><br>  The full-width PowerEdge FC830 server module is equipped with four processors.  It handles a wide range of mission-critical applications in enterprise data centers for medium and large companies.  The FC830 supports up to four multi-core Intel Xeon processors, 3TB of memory, up to eight PCIe expansion slots and up to sixteen 1.8-inch SATA flash drives (or up to eight 2.5-inch drives), as well as Express Flash NVMe PCIe SSD drives . <br><br><h3>  Customer Benefits </h3><br>  The PowerEdge FX architecture with integrated management capabilities makes it easy to configure, manage, and add capacity to easily handle specific workloads.  Organizations can choose a management style that best suits their needs: individual server management, typical of traditional rack servers, or collective management, typical of blade servers.  PowerEdge products are managed using the Active System Manager interface, third-party plug-ins, and technologies from the Dell OpenManage solution suite based on the Dell Integrated Remote Access Controller (iDRAC) without using agents with a lifecycle controller embedded in each server. <br><br>  Dell PowerEdge FX gives you the ability to manage, scale, and budget corporate infrastructures, both for your existing business needs and for the future.  The architecture combines the density and efficiency of server modules, the simplicity and cost-effectiveness of rack-mount systems, ensuring reliability, availability and serviceability, and allowing customers to cope with the ever-increasing demands of workloads.  Its application will be effective in many areas - both for large Internet businesses, and for investment management organizations or online communities for programmers. <br><br>  For questions contact: <u>dell@muk.ua</u> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/309966/">https://habr.com/ru/post/309966/</a></p>
