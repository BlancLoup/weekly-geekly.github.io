Antonym (anti-interaction and non-behavior) does not exist, and it is impossible not to interact. <br>  Everything on the site interacts with the user.  The location of the blocks, copywriting, text color, alignment of forms, the absence or presence of a grid are all parts of communication.  With a man, the same thing - the message carries everything from the type of gait to the skin color and the length of the skirt.  And all people perceive these messages almost instantly. <br><br>  Somewhere there was a study that girls decide whether to sleep with a boy (or vice versa) within a half second after they saw him.  And the site has about the same time to make an impression of a pleasant, necessary and interesting.  Well, maybe a little bit more, because the mechanism for evaluating other individuals has evolved longer than the algorithm for recognizing the necessary pages on the Internet.  The metric considers visits as less than 15 seconds as failures, but this is more likely an indicator of visitors, who seem to understand what you are doing, and for some reason this did not suit them.  But in &lt;5 seconds, people who may be in need of your services leave, but loading the page, they think ‚Äúoh my god, this is where I went‚Äù, and leave, having lost forever the opportunity to transform your life with the help of your dream site . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  For example, consider 2 sites for real estate search (I do not advertise any of the resources and have no relation to them): <br><h6>  1. CIAN </h6><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5f9/14d/b1f/5f914db1f47390c9b54f8acc6a470577.png"><br><br>  Suppose we do not know that this is a huge monstrous base throughout real estate (you don‚Äôt know? I envy, it means that the housing problem did not spoil you). <br>  What do you have time to understand in a half second? <br>  Everything, as in the passport office, it is obvious that there will be no beautiful smiling girls and martinis. <br>  According to the headings, it is clear that the site is about real estate, it seems throughout Russia (the column on the right).  The numbers (56,425 apartments in Moscow) are terrible, that is, there is a lot of data.  That is, if you have time to dig in this pile, you will have an apartment in the Central Administrative District without furniture, with white walls for 30,000, but the journey will be a long one.

    <h6>  2. And from our window </h6><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e55/28a/2fb/e5528a2fb09fc8c99dca146d422458e8.png"><br><br>  It quickly becomes clear that this is a cute, human place, no official organ.  There are few offers (in fact, there are only 3 of them), but since there is little information, it means that it is somewhat special. <br>  At a quick glance it is more or less clear that this is all happiness only in Moscow. <br><br>  So what messages do we get? <br><ol><li>  Brand character - business-corporate, luxurious, cozy </li><li>  The purpose of the site - what to do on it?  Read, buy, talk? </li><li>  The amount of information - is it a palace of sports or a temporary building?  How much time does it take for me?  Is there anything else here? </li></ol><br>  And if the first characteristic is more or less personal, and the third tends to change over time, then the site‚Äôs income directly depends on the second one.  If visitors incorrectly evaluate why the site is needed, it is either not touched or used incorrectly.  It‚Äôs as if the aborigines have found a lighter: it can change their whole life, but if they don‚Äôt get interested in it, or start using it like picking their nose, the culinary revolution will not happen. <br><br>  What should be done to use the site for its intended purpose?  There are two ways - simple and complex.  You can turn the page, place accents and priorities, make eye-catching interface.  And you can just introduce yourself. <br><br>  If a person in a white dressing gown and a hat comes up to you, you will most likely guess that he will treat your cold.  At the same time, with the same obviousness, you will understand that the one standing before you is a doctor, if he simply says so with a sufficient degree of conviction. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/de6/3f2/643/de63f264306fb54693c12b46befb7d20.jpg"><br><br>  For example, the site "They will find here" has a rather unusual and complex pattern of functioning. <br>  Therefore, in addition to the detailed FAQ and the form, at the very beginning there are several lines that explain what is happening: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/633/8fd/215/6338fd215c5c3832bdfe1f1500aa6366.png"><br><br>  The same, only a little more expensive and lengthy way to tell about yourself is the trailer.  For example, Dropbox prefers to explain how it will change your life for the better using video: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5bc/bf2/271/5bcbf2271e89a15be7428c3458540244.png"><br><br>  Trailers have an advantage - during the video you can show your advantages, fall in love with your product and create a clear image.  On the other hand, at the same dropbox clip takes two minutes.  That is, if the user does not have the extra two minutes, what will he do on this site, he will not understand.  Maybe there are boxes sold? <br><br>  (In a recent post, ‚Äú <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/146645/">Why I hate YouTube,</a> ‚Äù the author explained in detail why he doesn‚Äôt like to watch long videos, when you can say the same thing in two words. The article was about manuals, but it can be easily extrapolated to the promo pages) <br><br>  For example, here's the Prezi home page: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/16c/cc7/842/16ccc7842954aca3206b7ad6ed55d300.png"><br><br>  Even if I don‚Äôt watch the video, in less than a second I‚Äôll understand that you can create presentations on the site (drop-down or approaching, or it‚Äôs not yet known what, and to find out which, you can watch the video). <br><br>  On news sites there is the concept of lead - a short sentence that reflects the essence of the news.  The reader quickly perceives the news "In Yakutia, discovered the wreckage of a missing helicopter," "CERN announced the discovery of a new subatomic particle," and if he is interested, he will read in which area of ‚Äã‚ÄãYakutia the helicopter fell, its brand, number of passengers, or details of the Higgs boson.  But he had already learned the main events of the day in the first couple of seconds. <br><br>  On the other hand, if the service is not too complicated and has some single, simple and main function, what to do with it should be clear from the context, right? <br>  If your application, like a door, performs only one function, it should be clear from its appearance what you can do with it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/46e/413/596/46e413596c3d4b950511235ecb9fa859.jpg"><br><br>  On this door it is obvious that it needs to be pulled or pushed.  And the site should be clear how to use it.  If you need to buy on the site, it means that there should be goods there, prices and ‚Äúbuy‚Äù buttons. <br>  For example, here is an online store selling sporting goods, including tents: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/821/0a7/c91/8210a7c916063da8b25552f92bacb46a.png"><br><br>  Surely, the long text written by SEOs is optimized for the search algorithm.  Maybe it was thanks to him, the site on the first page in Google.  But the problem is that it does not look like an online store.  Cards with goods are on the second, if not on the third screen, and I doubt that a large number of users are interested in the text about ‚Äútourist tents, camping tents, buy a tourist tent‚Äù so much that it scrolls down. <br>  Imagine a sports shop, where the entire large hall is plastered with posters about a healthy lifestyle, and the goods lie in a small utility room in the far corner. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8af/d76/98d/8afd7698d64be36d2552c655cc095e36.jpg"><br>  <i>* only a thousand pixels below the first screen start the desired tents</i> <br><br><h5>  Results </h5><br>  The site should have on the main page, in the first screen, the typical signs of their specialization.  The shop has cards with goods, the air carrier has a set of forms somewhere, the search engine has a search line. <br><br>  Site description no longer than 5-6 words in a prominent place.  Mockinbird is an online prototyping tool, Dropbox is a cloud-based data store, Basecamph is a project management and collaboration tool.  It sounds like the captain's remarks Obviously, only for projects whose number of users has exceeded that pleasant line when the developers already have an impressive bank account, and at least every second of the target audience has heard about the project. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/147250/">https://habr.com/ru/post/147250/</a></p>
