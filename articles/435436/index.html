Under the cut - about serverless computing, "personal" quantum computers and AI systems. <br><br> <a href="https://habr.com/company/it-grad/blog/435436/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pq/jy/km/pqjykmnvdnqpt-alhawxsaid-pm.jpeg"></a> <a name="habracut"></a><br>  <font color="#A9A9A9"><i>/ photo <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/53255320%40N07/15770890033">16: 9clue</a> <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">CC BY</a></i></font> <br><br><h2>  1. Demand for serverless computing will grow </h2><br>  Serverless architecture (serverless) is an approach in which third-party providers take on the task of maintaining servers.  Thus, developers and system administrators do not have to spend resources on iron maintenance. 
      <br>

      Serverless systems offer all the necessary functionality in the form of services.  They can be either separate solutions (like the <a href="https://fnproject.io/">Fn Project</a> ) or entire ecosystems (for example, <a href="https://openwhisk.apache.org/">Apache OpenWhisk</a> or proprietary Azure). <br><br>  Serverless architecture, according to Gartner, will be one of the hottest trends this year.  Now less than 5% of companies around the world use a serverless approach, and by 2020 this figure will increase to 20%.  Already, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Serverless-Design-Patterns-Best-Practices/dp/178862064X">special literature</a> , <a href="https://github.com/serverless/serverless">frameworks</a> , <a href="http://serverlessconf.io/">conferences</a> are being held ( <a href="https://www.meetup.com/ru-RU/moscow-serverless/events/past/">including in Russia</a> ). <br><br>  One of the drivers of the growing popularity of serverless systems is <a href="https://www.ciodive.com/news/empowered-developers-cost-savings-drive-serverless-computing-adoption/542529/">reducing the</a> cost of configuration and iron content.  It is believed that system administrators spend about 30-40% of their time on setting up equipment.  Serverless architectures release these resources - the efforts of engineers can be directed to the development of the company's products and services. <br><br>  It is also expected that the ‚Äúboom‚Äù of machine learning algorithms <a href="https://hub.packtpub.com/how-serverless-computing-is-making-ai-development-easier/">will affect the</a> popularity of the serverless approach.  Cloud vendors are making a lot of effort to ensure the availability and scalability of IT infrastructure.  And these are the two most important components in the development of intelligent systems. <br><br><h2>  2. More companies will start using multi-cloud </h2><br>  According to a <a href="https://www.rightscale.com/lp/state-of-the-cloud">study by</a> Rightscale from 2018, about 80% of companies (out of a thousand respondents) have already switched to multi-cloud IT infrastructure.  This year this figure will grow - in Gartner they say that by 2020 it <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2017-04-05-gartner-says-a-massive-shift-to-hybrid-infrastructure-services-is-underway">will reach</a> 90%. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/opinions/why-multi-cloud-has-to-be-the-end-game/">The reasons for the</a> popularity of multi-cloud are cost savings and flexibility in the use of infrastructure.  Companies can choose the services of several cloud providers whose services suit them at a price.  At the same time to simplify the migration of applications between different environments are increasingly used containers.  According to <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3273347/security/containers-are-here-what-about-container-security.html">the</a> company ESG Research, by 2020, 33% of all workloads in the cloud will be containerized (today this number is 19%). <br><br>  Analysts call one of the most popular containerization technologies Kubernetes.  It is expected that in 2019 more solutions <a href="https://www.cio.com/article/3137946/cloud-computing/6-trends-that-will-shape-cloud-computing-in-2017.html">will appear</a> on the market to simplify the implementation of this orchestration tool.  For example, at the end of last year, VMware <a href="https://habr.com/company/it-grad/blog/430714/">acquired the</a> Heptio startup, developing solutions for the deployment of Kubernetes.  Kubernetes is also developing IBM as an instrument for creating hybrid cloud solutions, which acquired Red Hat for this purpose (also in 2018). <br><br><h2>  3. Clouds will help telecom operators with 5G sweep. </h2><br>  Deloitte predicts that the first commercial 5G networks will appear in 2019.  Already by 2020 the number of users of new generation networks will be 15‚Äì20 million people.  5G plan to use to maintain the operation of IoT-devices of <a href="https://www.verizon.com/about/our-company/5G/how-5g-can-power-industrial-internet-things">industrial systems</a> and " <a href="https://www.smartcitiesworld.net/news/news/orange-and-nokia-present-5g-use-cases-3331">smart cities</a> ".  In this case, the number of gadgets of the Internet of things in the coming years <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/471264/iot-number-of-connected-devices-worldwide/">will grow exponentially</a> . <br><br>  To cope with this load, telecommunications companies must provide a high level of infrastructure scalability.  Here <a href="https://habr.com/company/it-grad/blog/353686/">cloud technologies will come</a> to their aid. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rj/_0/f2/rj_0f2miz_lpzurr0yesw9w1ik0.jpeg"><br>  <font color="#A9A9A9"><i>/ photo by <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sagesolar/29108138033/">Derek Finch</a> <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">CC BY</a> (cropped)</i></font> <br><br>  VMware is <a href="https://ir.vmware.com/overview/press-releases/press-release-details/2018/VMware-Enables-Communications-Service-Providers-to-Chart-Their-Course-to-5G/">developing</a> virtual solutions that make it easier to work with the core of the wireless network architecture and offer customers new features.  An example would be VMware vCloud NFV for working with services and applications in a private and public cloud environment.  Nokia <a href="https://devops.com/nokia-releases-upgraded-cloudband-infrastructure-software-to-secure-5g-cloud-deployments-enhance-service-delivery-and-reduce-costs-for-customers/">created a</a> similar platform specifically for operators - the service uses OpenStack technologies to manage containers and virtual machines. <br><br>  In this case, not only the cloud will help the spread of 5G, but, conversely, the networks of the new generation will make cloud platforms more popular.  In Deloitte <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3308378/cloud-computing/5g-will-bring-cloud-computing-to-everyone.html">they say</a> that 5G will allow residents of remote regions where there is no high-speed Internet to use clouds. <br><br><h2>  4. Quantum machines will become more accessible to users. </h2><br>  IT companies are developing ever more powerful quantum processors.  Last year, Intel <a href="https://habr.com/company/it-grad/blog/347044/">introduced the</a> 49-qubit chip, and <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/03/a-preview-of-bristlecone-googles-new.html">Google</a> - 72-qubit. <br><br>  Some devices based on qubits can already be accessed through cloud services, such as Alibaba Cloud and <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/features/ibm-q-quantum-computing/">IBM Q.</a>  The quantum machines of these IT giants help research organizations and universities to create complex models that are difficult to give to ‚Äúclassic‚Äù computers, for example, to <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-a-quantum-computer-is-and-why-it-needs-to-be-more/">simulate the</a> behavior of a person‚Äôs immune system. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gs/tl/pu/gstlpuiprc83wgjs_9uv3cx3m3s.jpeg"><br>  <font color="#A9A9A9"><i>/ photo <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ibm_research_zurich/15499591645">IBM Research</a> <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/2.0/">CC BY</a></i></font> <br><br>  At the same time, 2019 may be the year of <b>"personal" quantum machines</b> .  In early January, IBM at CES 2019 <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ibm-unveils-ibm-q-system-one-the-first-commercial-quantum-computer-2019-1">showed Q System One</a> , the prototype of a commercial quantum computer for business.  This is a 20-qubit machine that, unlike other quantum computers, can operate outside the lab.  The necessary conditions for the functioning of the computer are created in a special sealed container-case. <br><br>  There is also a possibility that in 2019 a ‚Äúquantum superiority‚Äù will finally be achieved.  This is the moment in time when machines with qubits <a href="https://habr.com/company/it-grad/blog/347044/">start</a> solving a number of computational problems faster than classic computers.  Such tasks, for example, include the enumeration of keys SHA-256.  To prove the quantum superiority hypothesis, at the beginning of the year, Google plans to hold a performance competition with the NASA supercomputer.  The results of the experiment will be known in the summer. <br><br><h2>  5. Intelligent systems will manage the cloud </h2><br>  Machine learning will be used more frequently in managing multi-cloud systems and equipment in the data center.  Such technologies are called AIOps - AI for IT Operations.  The growing popularity of AIOps is predicted <a href="https://www.networkworld.com/article/3324050/data-center/10-predictions-for-the-data-center-and-the-cloud-in-2019.html">by</a> Network World and Gartner.  In 2019, 25% of organizations <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/06/05/aiops_can_ai_deliver_bsm_dreams_just_more_bs/">will</a> use intelligent algorithms to manage their IT infrastructure. <br><br>  AI systems for working with the cloud are already available in <a href="https://wikibon.com/oracle-brings-artificial-intelligence-data-management-toolchain/">Oracle</a> and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/janakirammsv/2018/12/09/5-artificial-intelligence-trends-to-watch-out-for-in-2019">Microsoft</a> services.  They help predict possible system failures and optimize workloads.  There is a case where the Azure Cloud Learning Algorithm <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/improving-azure-virtual-machine-resiliency-with-predictive-ml-and-live-migration/">predicted a</a> failure of one of the disks 20 minutes before it occurred.  This made it possible to quickly migrate the load from the failed server. <br><br>  Platforms for managing equipment in the data center are also developing - this service was created by HPE.  According <a href="https://thestack.com/data-centre/2018/11/19/hpe-brings-ai-cloud-management-direct-to-data-centre-servers/">to</a> company representatives, the platform helped customers reduce operating expenses by 79%, and the number of server failures - by 86%. <br><br><hr><br>  What we write about in the First blog about corporate IaaS: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/tendencii/pochemu-korporativnye-zakazchiki-ispolzuyut-virtualnye-mashiny-a-ne-kontejnery/">Why corporate customers use VMs, not containers</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/tendencii/kak-iaas-pomogaet-razvivat-biznes-tri-zadachi-kotorye-reshit-oblako/">How IaaS helps grow your business: three tasks that the cloud will solve</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/tendencii/besservernye-vychisleniya-v-oblake-trend-sovremennosti-ili-neobxodimost/">Serverless computing in the cloud - a trend of modernity or necessity?</a> </li></ul><br>  Posts from our Telegram channel: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://t.me/iaasblog/187">IT architecture of the future - who prepares for it and how</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://t.me/iaasblog/186">Blockchain in the work of a cloud provider - 3 areas of application</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://t.me/iaasblog/180">Data centers with your own DNA - how is it?</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/435436/">https://habr.com/ru/post/435436/</a></p>
