      In 2017, our language and speech applications will become more multilingual.  But this means not only expanding the list of languages ‚Äã‚Äãsupported by the system.  Of course, we will add new languages.  However, besides this, we will create systems that can understand, process and use a language that is a link between two languages ‚Äã‚Äãin bilinguals (for example, people who speak English and Spanish, French and Arabic, Hindi and English), when during a conversation, and sometimes and in the course of one sentence, they effortlessly move from one language to another. <br><br>  <i>What will be the main achievements or the most discussed technologies in the field of speech processing and natural language in 2027?</i> <i><br></i> <br>  Language models will be deeply embedded in cognitive models, which will enable artificial intelligence systems (AI) to justify their decisions and communicate with people without special efforts, adapt to different social situations, negotiate, argue and persuade people.  Computational sociolinguistics and pragmatic models will play an important role in creating AI, taking into account sociocultural factors. <br><br><hr><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3af/537/524/3af5375249d843bea2b26883aff11522.jpg" align="left" width="120">  <b><a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/jchayes/">Jennifer Chace</a> , scientist, managing director, research laboratories in New England and New York</b> <br><br>  <i>What are the most important <b>machine learning</b> improvements <b>to</b> be expected in 2017?</i> <br><br>  Deep learning transforms a multitude of technologies.  However, most of the existing algorithms remain heuristic, they rely on the experience and intuition of managers.  In 2017, we will come to a more structured understanding of deep learning and, therefore, we will be able to develop more powerful algorithms.  This area is developing thanks to developments in various disciplines, including statistical physics and computer science. <br><br>  <i>What will be the main achievements or the most discussed technologies in the field of machine learning algorithms in 2027?</i> <br><br>  Artificial intelligence and machine learning systems will greatly facilitate our lives.  The existing algorithms are often biased with respect to data, they can be manipulated by entering obviously wrong information.  One of the major improvements over the next ten years will be the development of objective algorithms that are resistant to data manipulation attempts. <br><br><hr><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4ef/677/23a/4ef67723a2de46ac9ad21e150c2735a0.jpg" align="left" width="120">  <b><a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/sdumais/">Susan Dume</a> , Scientist and Deputy Director, Research Laboratory in Redmond, Washington, USA</b> <br><br>  <i>What are the most important improvements <b>in search and information</b> to expect in 2017?</i> <br><br>  In the field of searching and receiving information, the possibilities of deep learning will be fully involved.  Over the past few years, we have witnessed breakthroughs in speech recognition, image recognition and natural language processing.  These new features are due to the emergence of new deep learning architectures combined with an increase in data volume and an increase in computing power.  Next year, deep learning models will improve the quality of search on the Internet; they will learn how to better understand documents and formulate queries using a machine. <br><br>  <i>What will be the main achievements or the most discussed technologies in the field of searching and receiving information in 2027?</i> <br><br>  The search field that we are used to will disappear.  Instead, the ubiquitous built-in context-sensitive search functionality will appear.  The beginning of this transformation can be considered voice requests, especially when using mobile devices and ‚Äúsmart home‚Äù systems.  This trend will evolve; it will be possible to issue search queries consisting of sound, images, and video, using the context for proactively obtaining information related to the current location, materials, objects, or actions without sending the requests explicitly. <br><br><hr><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d68/177/117/d68177117fcf4291835b482575f437d3.jpg" align="left" width="120">  <b><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/sarajand/">Sarah Jane Dunn</a> , scientist, research laboratory in Cambridge, UK</b> <br><br>  <i>What are the most important improvements <b>in biological computing</b> expected in 2017?</i> <br><br>  Despite the widespread use of computer and technical analogies for the "explanation" of biology, the calculations performed by cells are carried out in a completely different way than calculations in microprocessors.  In the short term, an important achievement will be a theoretical justification for understanding the processing of biological information: this is very important because our goal is to model, change and reprogram the behavior of cells. <br><br>  <i>What will be the main achievements or the most discussed technologies in the field of biological computing in 2027?</i> <br><br>  If we talk about the development of programming based on biological models, in ten years completely new industries and solutions may arise in various fields, from agriculture and medicine to energy, materials and computing systems.  Over the past 50 years, people's lives have radically changed thanks to the creation of programs for silicon microprocessors.  But now we are waiting for a new revolution: the era of live programs. <br><br><hr><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/19a/d77/042/19ad7704254a418d85ab09d99994dd42.jpg" align="left" width="120">  <b><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/margon/">Mar Gonzalez Franco</a> , Researcher, MSR NExT, Redmond, Washington, USA</b> <br><br>  <i>What are the most important improvements <b>in virtual reality to</b> be expected in 2017?</i> <br><br>  In 2017, virtual reality devices will appear with an improved body tracking function.  Due to this, it will be possible to create virtual "avatars" and manage them, looking at the virtual world from the first person. <br><br>  <i>What will be the main achievements or the most discussed technologies in the field of virtual reality in 2027?</i> <br><br>  By 2027, virtual reality systems will be used everywhere, they will use several senses at once, and are able to mix perceived reality with virtual reality or to change it.  With this technology, people will be able to restore, change or improve their perception of reality.  Unlike existing virtual reality systems that model only image and sound, in the future it will be possible to use other modes, such as tactile impact. <br><br><hr><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/914/f70/3cd/914f703cd9a440beaba37d55ddf98649.jpg" align="left" width="120">  <b><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/mlg/">Mary Gray</a> , Senior Researcher, New England Research Lab</b> <br><br>  <i>What are the most important improvements and changes <b>in the social sciences to</b> be expected in 2017?</i> <br><br>  Social scientists and computer scientists will together develop new methods to compare and evaluate cultural, economic and political ‚Äúfilter bubbles‚Äù (isolated streams of personalized news and information on the Internet), as well as determine how they affect the daily lives of people outside the Internet. <br><br>  <i>What will be the main achievements or the most discussed technologies in the social sciences in 2027?</i> <br><br>  By 2027, almost 30% of the US adult population will be involved in work using artificial intelligence: these can be products manufactured using AI, or services, such as tax or medical advice.  Consumers may not know whether people are involved in creating the goods and services they consume.  Social sciences will play an important role in the development of technologies and policies to create a new 21st century security network that takes into account the model of work using AI. <br><br><hr><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b46/cd9/70b/b46cd970b6b34f88be6df19e0ff704e9.jpg" align="left" width="120">  <b><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/kahofman/">Katya Hofman</a> , researcher, research laboratory in Cambridge, UK</b> <br><br>  <i>What are the most important improvements <b>in artificial intelligence and machine learning to</b> be expected in 2017?</i> <br><br>  In 2017, the main focus of the development of AI will be computer games.  Experimental gaming-based platforms will make it possible to quickly test new ideas.  One of them is <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/project-malmo/">Project Malmo</a> .  This is the development of my team, aimed at conducting experiments with AI in the game Minecraft.  Personally, I really like the potential of using AI for collaboration.  We have almost reached an understanding of how AI can learn from us and work with us to help us achieve our goals. <br><br>  <i>What will be the main achievements or the most discussed technologies in the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning in 2027?</i> <br><br>  AI is developing very quickly.  It is difficult to overestimate its role in creating new opportunities and solving important global challenges.  For me, the most important topic for discussion is the practical application of these discoveries and the enormous potential in the form of technologies that bring the greatest benefit to society. <br><br><hr><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/48f/e6d/8ef/48fe6d8ef22343c6a82df9b0089a5abf.jpg" align="left" width="120">  <b><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/nicimm/">Nicole Immorlika</a> , Senior Researcher, New England Research Lab</b> <br><br>  <i>What are the most important breakthroughs <b>in economics and game theory to</b> be expected in 2017?</i> <br><br>  In the era of big data, people have to make increasingly complex decisions, put more effort into making the right choice.  In the future, economists will develop new theories about non-optimal behavior due to excessive complexity, and IT specialists will create automated machine learning tools that can help people in such situations. <br><br>  <i>What will be the main achievements or the most discussed technologies in economics and game theory in 2027?</i> <br><br>  By 2027, automation will lead to the creation of a new economy in which the social contribution of most people will be determined by the data they create, rather than the work they do.  Economists will look for ways to equitably reward people for this contribution.  This will most likely require a larger-scale redistribution of funds through mechanisms such as taxes and social programs. <br><br><hr><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/092/166/ac9/092166ac95dc4ced93caa17d6b362664.jpg" align="left" width="120">  <b><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/klauter/">Christine Lauter</a> , Principal Researcher, Research Laboratory in Redmond, Washington, USA</b> <br><br>  <i>What are the most important breakthroughs <b>in math and encryption</b> to expect in 2017?</i> <br><br>  To protect the medical and genetic data of patients and hospitals, new mathematical solutions will be deployed that support calculations with encrypted data.  New homomorphic encryption schemes protect data, while retaining the ability to predict risk, analyze and issue alerts using cloud computing.  Solutions based on homomorphic encryption will soon be deployed in the financial sector to protect important bank data. <br><br>  <i>What will be the main achievements or the most discussed technologies in mathematics and encryption in 2027?</i> <br><br>  Mathematical discoveries will form the basis of a new generation of encryption systems.  By 2027, quantum computers will appear capable of cracking at least the least resistant traditional ciphers.  If we talk about long-term data protection, then we are already developing the first wave of ‚Äúpost-quantum‚Äù encryption systems based on the recently inaccessible mathematical problems proposed.  Taking into account the development of mathematical methods and algorithms, in ten years a second wave of ‚Äúpost-quantum‚Äù encryption systems should appear, more effective than all existing systems. <br><br><hr><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f8e/6d8/ff4/f8e6d8ff43914309a385c615f1c53765.jpg" align="left" width="120">  <b><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/mckinley/">Catherine McKinley</a> , Principal Investigator, Redmond Research Laboratory, Washington, USA</b> <br><br>  <i>What are the most important improvements <b>in programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãand software development to</b> be expected in 2017?</i> <br><br>  In programming languages, the most significant step will be probabilistic programming, in which developers will create models that evaluate the real world and explicitly justify the uncertainty in data and calculations.  At the heart of the new software will continue to be the program code, and by the end of 2017 there will be new interesting applications. <br><br>  <i>What will be the main achievements or the most discussed technologies in programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãand software creation in 2027?</i> <br><br>  By 2027, most software engineers will be free to navigate programming systems that work on the basis of estimates and create models with statistical methods.  This change will make it possible to release applications that process data from sensors, use machine learning and approximation to interact with people in a completely new way. <br><br><hr><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5ac/a32/b01/5aca32b01c9c48e8804c46623fdab594.jpg" align="left" width="120">  <b><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/cecilym/">Cecily Morrison</a> , Researcher, Cambridge, UK, research laboratory</b> <br><br>  <i>What are the most important improvements <b>in anthropocentric computing and accessibility</b> to expect in 2017?</i> <br><br>  People with visual impairments will make extensive use of individual means of assistance, new technologies in this area will find technical implementation. <br><br>  <i>What will be the main achievements or the most discussed technologies in the field of anthropocentric computing and accessibility in 2027?</i> <br><br>  All children, including those with disabilities, will be able to learn programming if they want.

Users will be less likely to install applications on their devices, and applications will increasingly turn into background services like chat bots and personal assistants. <br><br>  <i>What will be the main achievements or the most discussed technologies for mobile devices in 2027?</i> <br><br>  The main improvement in mobile devices in 2027 will be a significant expansion of interaction with the digital world, it will cover almost any objects and technologies used by people.  We will use personal intellectual systems that are truly capable of understanding us, deserving our trust and knowing us so well, in order not only to satisfy our needs, but also to foresee them. <br><br><hr><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fb7/ad7/bdb/fb7ad7bdb5ec4ce69c8ada157ff74ebf.jpg" align="left" width="120">  <b><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/astar/">Asta Roseway</a> , Principal Researcher, Research Laboratory in Redmond, Washington, USA</b> <br><br>  <i>What are the most important improvements <b>in environmental care, environmental protection and design</b> to expect in 2017?</i> <br><br>  In 2017, research will begin on the use of the Internet of Things in agriculture, including the widespread use of sensors, computer vision and cloud storage capabilities for intensive machine learning and analytics.  Using such solutions, farmers will be able to monitor, analyze and diagnose the state of their farms at all levels. <br><br>  <i>What will be the main achievements or the most discussed technologies in the field of environmental care, environmental protection and design in 2027?</i> <br><br>  Farmers will use the capabilities of artificial intelligence to maintain high yields, regardless of climate change, droughts and natural disasters.  The future of food production depends on our ability to conserve the most important resources of our planet and use them more efficiently, to reduce the area of ‚Äã‚Äãland used in agriculture, due to the transition from traditional to alternative methods with lower energy consumption, for example, to vertical farms and aquaponic.  With regard to ecology, the focus will be on preserving forests using modern technologies and sensor readings, as well as more active use of urban space to meet our agricultural needs. <br><br><hr><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fac/a2e/48d/faca2e48d0de47c9bb924626dec092e4.jpg" align="left" width="120">  <b><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/kstrauss/">Karin Strauss</a> , Senior Researcher, Research Laboratory in Redmond, Washington, USA</b> <br><br>  <i>What are the most important improvements <b>in equipment and devices</b> to expect in 2017?</i> <br><br>  Moore's Law is slowly slowing down.  Maintaining the pace of development of general-purpose silicon-based processors and with capacitive memory is too expensive.  Therefore, in 2017, a number of new specialized hardware accelerators will appear, mainly in the form of FPGA processors.  They will be used in the cloud to improve performance while reducing costs (instead of linear capacity increase according to Moore's law).  Of course, general-purpose processors will continue to improve, although not as rapidly as before.  As a result, we will get more interesting, faster and safer cloud based services.  New devices and accessories for virtual and augmented reality, both cheap and expensive, will also appear on the market.  As a result, new applications will appear on these platforms, as well as interesting developments in the field of creating content for virtual and augmented reality, including 360-degree video filming and similar solutions. <br><br>  <i>What will be the main achievements or the most discussed technologies for equipment and devices in 2027?</i> <br><br>  By 2027, we can expect the development of a number of new technologies that are not associated with a linear increase in the power of silicon microprocessors.  Carbon nanotubes and other molecular production techniques, new architectures, in particular, computational approaches closer to the data, new computational and storage paradigms of data, such as quantum computers and DNA-based storage devices, may be developed to become available for commercial use.  There will be a jump in the development of AI technologies with reduced energy consumption, as well as screens located near the user's eyes, due to which we will get more intelligent devices and enhanced capabilities of augmented and virtual reality. <br><br><hr><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/868/544/f93/868544f937744d21824f2140bd493844.jpg" align="left" width="120">  <b><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/xysun/">Xiaoyan Song</a> , Lead Researcher, Asia Research Lab</b> <br><br>  <i>What are the most important advances <b>in computer vision</b> to expect in 2017?</i> <br><br>  In 2017, the development of computer vision technologies based on deep learning techniques will continue.

The necessary information will be generated automatically and offered by the user based on contextual analytical information.  When forming and proposing information, the user's reaction is taken into account, thereby creating an effective and fast feedback loop.  Users will be able to perform analytical tasks, spending less time and effort. <br><br>  <i>What will be the main achievements or the most discussed technologies in the field of analytics and data representation in 2027?</i> <br><br>  Thanks to improvements in analytics and data presentation in 2027, cross-analytics of data from different sources and different fields at different semantic levels will be available.
