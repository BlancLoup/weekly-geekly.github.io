  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Quite another tomorrow (story)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the morning I woke up from a light sea breeze, a gentle touch and a barely audible kiss.  I liked it.  No wonder yesterday I spent half an hour searching the web for an appropriate program for the alarm. <br><br>  After enjoying the last seconds of bliss, I jumped out of bed.  Seconds now cost a lot of money, and you should not spend it on any nonsense.  It is said that our ancestors worked eight hours a day and believed that they were breaking out.  Now the official working day is 12 hours, but rarely is this limited.  Young and motivated people work fourteen and sometimes sixteen hours a day.  Seven days a week.  I am not an exception, I am not a bummer. <br><br>  Hastily went into the bathroom and turned on the device for morning hygiene.  I met my eyes with my reflection, and I did not like it.  I quickly corrected the mirror settings, and here, in the intervals between advertising, a fresh and fit young man was looking at me.  That's better! <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/fb0/4b1/7b6/fb04b17b6f324cfd8c8dbc1c7306ed71.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Judging by the muttering in the ear of a newsader, today there were wide checkered trousers and tight-fitting acid-colored T-shirts in fashion.  Prices bite them, and I spent a couple of minutes reading Asian sites.  Once again, I thanked myself for learning baihua and a couple of thousand hieroglyphs a year ago.  Because of this, I saved about thirty percent a day, ordering things and sometimes products straight from the manufacturer.

      After just a couple of minutes, the divider was clicked, and I took out the clothes sewn from the needle.  Just think, and in fact I remember those times when the parcel had to wait a few days or even weeks!  How old I am. <br><br>  Having dressed in a hurry, I sat down opposite a working visualizer.  Volumetric charts, diagrams and, at the same time, the physiognomy of my boss, dressed in the latest fashion in an acid-fitting T-shirt, surfaced above the table.  The soulless machine paid only working seconds, so I started gesticulating desperately for the same hour, from which the images above the table twisted in an insane dance.  I compared the columns of the tables, generated new charts, pointed to extremum points in automatically generated reports. <br><br>  A little further and diagonally stood the second (my personal) visualizer.  He displayed a globe on which green dots flashed every now and then ‚Äî my friends went online.  My friends are my pride, because I purchased them not by a five-dollar subscription for a thousand pieces at a time, but in live network communication, discussing various philosophical topics, and sometimes arguing to a nervous breakdown about something very important. <br><br>  I even saw one of them offline.  It happened three years ago, during an accident at an electrical substation.  Then the frightened citizens began to look out the windows, and I saw the face of my friend in the house opposite.  It seems that he recognized me too then, because his look had changed.  Fortunately, the accident was quickly eliminated.  A few days later I was a little nervous when I met him online, but, fortunately, he had the tact not to discuss that meeting. <br><br>  The car highly appreciated every second of my time, and I tried not to stop manipulating the charts even when I looked through the new visualizer for new catalogs of fashionable things or communicated with friends. <br><br>  The divider peacefully clicked, delivering the things I ordered.  But I did not waste time getting them out of the box.  The fact of delivery of these expensive and fashionable things was displayed in my profile, and this was enough to maintain status.  And I would spend such precious seconds walking from the table to the divider.  However, for the meal I had to get up after all.  And I once again thought about moving the workplace closer to the divider. <br><br>  It's time to order a permutation in the apartment.  I need five rooms and two tiers to maintain status, but it is extremely tiring and time consuming to walk around them.  Of course, the thought of the trouble required for the reshuffle frightened me.  First you need to order redevelopment to the designers so that the bed, shower, table and divider are located nearby, and everything else is placed in unused rooms.  Then you need to choose a company that will undertake the implementation of the plan and send their robots to move the furniture.  But the most difficult thing is to find such performers who do not display the result of activity in the profile.  If someone finds out that I do not use the entire area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe apartment, then the cost of renting themselves will not be worth it. <br><br>  Once I read an anonymous report of one manager.  Brought to the pen, he manually rearranged the furniture in his apartment so that no one would know about it.  But I can not spend time on physical labor, I need to earn money.  Maintaining a standard of living is not cheap. <br><br>  And then it dawned on me!  Trying not to be distracted from graphs and diagrams, I looked through the catalogs of the newest models of visualizers and selected the best one.  The delivator did not have time to click, and I already posted an ad: "An experienced analyst of sales statistics is looking for work." <br><br>  After half an hour, a third visualizer was on my workplace, and on it, in addition to graphs and diagrams, was the face of another boss.  And although the performance indicators on the first visualizer lowered slightly in the evening, the total operating time per day increased one and a half times!  Now I can afford a bigger apartment and a new newsloader and priority status on the divider!  Tomorrow all this will be displayed in my profile.  Tomorrow I will have a completely different life! <br><br>  Tired but pleased, I turned off the computers, threw out-of-date clothing and the items I purchased during the day into the waste recycler‚Äôs basket and went to bed. <br><br>  Text - D.Ivanov <br>  Illustration - O.Ivanova </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/373645/">https://habr.com/ru/post/373645/</a></p>
