Not so long ago, I got to the test a marvelous thing - a wireless column ... a headset ... stereo ... I, I confess, I don‚Äôt know what to call this engineering marvel.  Let there be a wireless audio system.  Her name is <b>SoundBlaster</b> <b><i>Axx</i></b> <b>SBX-20</b> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8a3/45f/dfc/8a345fdfc30714560815338a68cf96e0.jpg"><br><br>  In its modest capabilities - playing (and recording) sound without wires (and by wires), working with all popular operating systems and mobile devices, a lot of smart electronic functions and powerful software, but let's do everything in order ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Appearance </h4><br>  Let's start with the unique design of this wonderful combine.  The entire line of <b><i>Axx</i></b> (and in it, for now, three devices - SBX-20, SBX-10, SBX-8) is a hexagonal tower with touch control of its top.  Such architectural refinement is already patented by Creative (and where without it in our times), so the hexagonal towers with sloping peaks, seen by you in some electronics store, are almost 100% one of <b><i>Axx</i></b> 's.

      The height of the turret at the top model is 40 centimeters with a pretty penny.  The appearance is quite unusual, and those who saw this device for the first time and in the off state had quite different thoughts about what this thing was for and why it was here. <br><br>  On the rear panel, in addition to the phase inverter and a small panel with connectors (micro USB for power, 3.5 mm MiniJack for audio input / output and a single button with the BlueTooth icon, there is nothing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b61/485/ae1/b61485ae1d87bedb01c92b2b6d11ef83.jpg"><br><br>  All other six faces are tightened with a fine upholstery mesh.  The top is designed concisely and neatly - on the hexagonal touch panel - six hexagonal control buttons and a volume slider.  Everything. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d82/722/d33/d82722d33d3e96c654c5b37ddf698a7e.jpg"><br><br>  Someone, it may seem that this is not enough, who knows, maybe in the second version the information on the hexagonal oled display will be dynamically displayed there.  In the meantime, what is is enough to control the basic functions of the audio system. <br><br><h4>  What to connect? </h4><br>  In my opinion, the main ‚Äúaudience‚Äù of the devices that <b>SoundBlaster</b> <b><i>Axx</i></b> will work <b><i>with</i></b> are smartphones and tablets.  On the second place are laptops, nettops and monoblocks.  And the personals and other big brothers are a very small segment, usually, they have more serious acoustics or headphones.  So what is this ‚Äúkid‚Äù capable of? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/651/601/36a/65160136af31e1742b6efa61afad3b24.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Functional </h4><br>  The first and most important function is, of course, sound reproduction.  The source is BlueTooth A2DP or an incoming wired signal through the classic three and a half millimeters.  Playback quality ... well, this topic is sick for Habr. <br><br>  You should not expect a shaky floor from the bass, crystal-clear treble, elastic and rich sound on the ‚Äúmiddle‚Äù and warm tube even harmonics.  For devices of similar size and class - the sound is more than worthy, especially since in such a form factor and with such a wide functionality of the device is not found at all.  The volume is sufficient for a small kitchen or bedroom, it will be ‚Äúhollow‚Äù in the living room, and if the voice of the speaker transmits normally, then in terms of playing music of amazing volume it is not worth waiting.  On the other hand, again, given the size and purpose of such a thing - the result is quite decent. <br><br>  The second main function is voice recording and transmission.  This is where, where, and here everything is very, very cool.  First of all, the device from both the hardware and software sides is very well-grounded: an array of multi-directional microphones and sly electronics inside can work wonders.  Here you are both tracking the sound source with automatic volume adjustments, and noise reduction for a variety of hardware-software solutions, and the ‚Äúsound beam‚Äù function (turning on narrowly directed microphones and cutting off the ‚Äúbackground‚Äù), and just high-quality hardware - the sound is, of course, not studio sound. qualities, but the voice remains well and clearly recognizable, unless you, of course, wish the opposite (more on that later). <br><br>  The ‚Äújunior‚Äù functionality is embedded in the software that is available for Android, iOS, PC and Macs.  The possibilities of it ... well, they are not limitless, but they crammed all sly algorithms.  Several different sound improvers (which I personally don‚Äôt really believe, but they influence the sound, though not very much), which are only suitable for compensating the quality of the audio track on a downloaded rip or series;  EQ and a set of proprietary noise reduction features with the ability to customize them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/159/87c/250/15987c2509f7f754730d9e835cec0d26.jpg"><br><br>  As a bonus, there is a fun utility called <b>VoiceFX</b> - a digital voice ‚Äúdistortor‚Äù that has a set of presets that allow you to ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù the sound of your voice.  Not a bad thing for jokes and practical jokes, but no more.  It is unlikely that anyone in their right mind would want to speak in the voice of a robot or a child.  But to slightly lower the tone of the voice and, picking up the phone, answer ‚Äúthe base of torpedo boats‚Äù or some other heresy ... :) <br><br><h4>  Interiors and Characteristics </h4><br>  At the heart of the <b>SoundBlaster</b> <b><i>Axx</i></b> is the powerful quad-core ‚Äústone‚Äù <b>SB-Axx1</b> , designed specifically for the <b><i>Axx</i></b> line.  In addition to hardware acceleration and compression when encoding / decoding audio, it is responsible for the excellent performance of the noise suppressors and other ‚Äúmicrophone tricks‚Äù.  Of course, the merit of clever algorithms and other hardware components should not be written off, but according to the information that I was given along with the device, most of the magic is in the new processor and its capabilities. <br><br>  There are three <b>SoundBlaster</b> <b><i>Axx</i></b> models on the market: the SBX-20 and SBX-10 with fully wireless connectivity with devices, as well as the pure PC-based and Mac version of the SBX-8, connected via USB, which I know the least about. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e3d/ea4/8d5/e3dea48d5eab27c6fd3bf1d4d8111a62.jpg"><br><br>  The official feature list states that the device: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Works with all Bluetooth wireless devices. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Support for iOS, Android, PC and Mac apps <br>  ‚Ä¢ Two corner speakers for stereo sound <br>  ‚Ä¢ Dual microphone with voice focus technology <br>  ‚Ä¢ Noise reduction and voice focusing technology <br>  ‚Ä¢ SBX Pro Studio and CrystalVoice technologies with hardware acceleration <br>  ‚Ä¢ Control buttons integrated in backlit touch panel <br>  ‚Ä¢ Aux-In for wired connection to audio sources <br><br>  This list of features is relevant for the "twenty" and "ten", the eight, perhaps, lost not only the wireless interface, but also some software features. <br><br>  The power consumption is quite small - the column works confidently from USB charging from a phone or a <a href="http://www.luxa2.com/product_showroom.aspx%3Fs%3D67">Luxa2 P1</a> standalone battery (which I will write about, too, on occasion). <br><br><h4>  Thinking out loud </h4><br>  Yes, in <b><i>Axx</i></b> there is no tube amplifier, oxygen-free copper, tears of Vlad Vladimych Puten, a fragment of the Mayan calendar or a latent image of a Vitruvian man.  But there is a very nice set of features and good sound for compact acoustics, designed for laptops and tablets / smartphones. <br><br>  And the excellent voice recording, noise reduction and volume equalization capabilities make it possible to use <b><i>Axx</i></b> as a headset at work or at home without any problems.  A pleasant bonus is the possibility of using several devices in different parts of the room or at home - the signal will calmly go to the <b><i>Axx</i></b> 's nearest you and the music, interlocutor or Skype conference will always be there, they will always hear you and you - them perfectly. <br><br>  The price of the SBX-20 is at the level of 8-10 thousand rubles, depending on the store.  A little less powerful system SBX-10 should cost about seven and a half thousand.  Deprived of SBX-8 wireless interfaces ‚Äî even less than four and a half. <br><br>  Is <b><i>Axx</i></b> worth the money?  I think it is worth it.  Firstly, the sound quality of this baby is more than decent (relative to its size).  Secondly, working as a microphone deserves a separate study and a deep and thoughtful article in which it is necessary to test the noise level, take measurements on expensive equipment and other abstruse things that are not so interesting to people who are used to ‚Äúbought, turned on, use, happy at all 100 ".  But it is precisely to such a juke-case that <b><i>Axx has</i></b> . <br><br>  Well, if you are not interested in ‚Äúmicrophone‚Äù functions, then attention should be paid to the Creative Zii Sound line, which is in the next issue. <br><br>  <b>ps:</b> Noticed a mistake?  Have questions?  Write to the PM, I will gladly correct, answer and help as much as I can. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/163487/">https://habr.com/ru/post/163487/</a></p>
