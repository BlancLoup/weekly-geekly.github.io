  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Employee survey. Main mistake</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  When planning a survey of employees, there is usually a lot of talk about methodology, samples, and other statistical terms.  But for a successful survey, its organizers usually lack the main thing - to look at employees not as respondents (read: experimental rats), but as people whose opinion is really important to find out.  This directly affects the quality of the sample, because most often the response to the survey leaves much to be desired, and it consists mostly of answers from new and ‚Äúguilty‚Äù ones.  The report on the results of such a survey is completely useless for the company, and information taken seriously can be dangerous. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sf/or/cw/sforcwl1wxdymhotio3pwnthuk4.jpeg" alt="image"></div>  <i>Source: zooplandia.ru</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The organizers of the study sometimes try to solve the problem of low response by ‚Äúadministrative leverage‚Äù, but the answers ‚Äúunder the lash‚Äù usually do not reflect the real opinion of employees. <br><br><h2>  How to get a good response when interviewing employees? </h2><br><h3>  1. Motivation </h3><br>  At the invitation to the survey, stimulate employees.  You should not choose the incentive time of day off or bonuses, it will not work in favor of the seriousness of the study.  Practice shows that feedback is a good incentive for employees.  Assure about this even in the text of the invitation to the survey and be sure to keep the promise.  When evaluating employees, you can send out personal reports (using an <a href="https://www.testograf.ru/ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dopros_sotrudnikov_glavnaya_oshibka">online survey service</a> with automated processing of results is a matter of a few clicks).  If you ask to rate the company, after completing the survey, share a report and a list of measures that were decided to be taken based on the survey results.  Everyone values ‚Äã‚Äãtheir time and wants to see the results of their activities.  Prove to employees that participating in a survey is a useful 5 minutes of their lives.  This will increase both the response and the degree of deliberation and sincerity of the answers.

      If previously the company did not have the practice of mandatory feedback after participating in a survey, do not expect instant results, trust will have to be earned.  This will help send reports to those employees who did not respond to the survey.  It is necessary to show that the voices of employees are heard. <br><br><h3>  2. Brevity </h3><br>  A quick survey looks more attractive to employees.  Often the wording can be reduced by half, as well as to remove the questions asked on the basis of the logic "then we ask it too."  In non-anonymous surveys you can not include questions about the name, position, etc.  - You can add this information yourself. <br><br>  Also it is worth informing the staff the number of questions and the expected time of completion.  If the survey went beyond 10-12 questions, you can diversify it with pictures, add a star rating or smilies, and if possible reduce matrix (tabular) questions.  It happens that employees drop a survey without completing it.  The fill indicator can help to increase the number of completed surveys (when an employee sees how many questions or% are left to fill). <br><br><h3>  3. Anonymity </h3><br>  Often, employees are assured of the complete anonymity of the survey, while asking for gender, age, position, and even a department.  This data is almost always enough to identify an employee. <br><br>  Sending a survey to employees by e-mail also causes them to doubt the anonymity of the study.  And for good reason.  E-mail surveys using the online polling service link the e-mail address to the employee‚Äôs response. <br><br>  A reliable way to conduct an anonymous survey is an anonymous link.  To increase employee confidence in the introductory text, list the steps you have taken to ensure the anonymity of the study. <br><br>  If the survey is not anonymous, explain how employees are protected from punitive management measures in the event of, for example, negative company evaluations.  It is better if non-anonymous answers will be analyzed cumulatively and not considered separately.  This is also worth mentioning in the information before the survey. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ai/d2/at/aid2attn1nftfa5avhjvmwcf8ke.jpeg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Source: pikabu.ru</i> <br><br><h3>  4. Time </h3><br>  If there is an opportunity, it is worthwhile to give employees time to respond to the survey.  Solving urgent work tasks even interested employees can simply forget about it.  It is also better not to stretch the collection of responses, and limit the late evening of the same day.  In this case, the probability of forgetting or postponing until later and forgetting becomes lower. <br><br>  To summarize  When organizing employee surveys, people often forget that in order to increase conversion and sincerity of answers, it is necessary to take into account the interests of the employees themselves and to build trust with them. <br><br>  If you selected an online survey as a way to conduct an employee survey, the article ‚Äú <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297686/">5 services for online surveys</a> ‚Äù will be useful to you. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/452182/">https://habr.com/ru/post/452182/</a></p>
