  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Circus left. What to do to those who stayed? (In the wake of the 4th Startup Weekend in Moscow)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  As a result of the discussion about Arkady Fomich Moreynis‚Äôs article <a href="http://roem.ru/2011/02/07/moreinis01/">‚ÄúHow to defend an idea?‚Äù</a> , Finally, an adequate understanding of the importance of normal startup ideas emerged from the underground.  Little by little, the slender chorus of investors and their frantic supporters managed to bring confusion.  And put on the forefront of the project IDE, moving programmers and web designers. <br><br>  Why is the idea behind the project important and its author must be protected?  - Because without them we see only what, by and large, is called the start-up movement.  After one of the points, German Klimenko noted low training and qualifications of those who spoke and presented their projects.  There were practically no people who would ‚Äúhurt‚Äù their ideas.  In fact, in the first months of the work of Glavstart LLC by A. Moreinis, it turned out that 90% of young and not so young Internet entrepreneurs come with developments and ideas resembling outright slag. <br><br>  Even a list of more than 60 projects on Glavstarta site, placed on the so-called <a href="http://glavstart.ru/vitrina.shtml">"Storefront"</a> , i.e.  the projects ‚Äúhave gone through Startup Weekend and continue their work‚Äù, frankly not impressive.  Three projects received (or allegedly received) investments from Glavstarta;  the fate of the rest is foggy.  Social network of classical music lovers ... Playing in the city "tag" ... N-yes ... Startups like "Tutochki" or "Yandex Metro" are remembered right away from the first weekend. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It has already become clear that there is a catastrophic shortage of well-developed ideas.  At the same time, there is no shortage of technical specialists.  They used to be in bulk, and after a series of posts on Habr√© ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/glavstart/blog/112434/">one</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/glavstart/blog/112515/">two</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/glavstart/blog/112635/">three</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/glavstart/blog/113003/">four</a> ) the number increased dramatically due to the involvement of a number of web studios and teams of freelancers.  It turned out that they, possessing a certain professionalism and (or) experience, understanding of the Internet and its audience, and the like, nevertheless, showed great interest in the opportunity to get a share in a startup for their work resources.  And why?  Why don‚Äôt they themselves launch one or several projects? Why do they need ‚ÄúIdeas that cost nothing‚Äù?

    <h5>  And then, that they have nothing to run. </h5><br>  They just do not know what to pile.  And Glavstart basically does not know that either.  Because there are neither normal concepts, nor those who will become a project visionary. <br><br>  Much of this is expected from the 4th Weekend.  The Internet was filled with rumors that there was a hard selection even at the pre-stage, during which deliberately impassable projects were eliminated.  A. Moreinis announced his departure from StartPoint, focusing on Glavstart.  Probably because the points have already fulfilled their advertising function and, in general, have exhausted themselves.  And the Weekends should have offered something new. <br>  Yeah, well. <br><br>  The fourth weekend in the not yet officially launched hall of the Digital October showed only what had previously been on the surface.  Ideally intelligent projects (if such exist at all, which we should assume) for the most part did not come to shine on Startup Weekend.  German Klimenko spoke about this trend in an interview.  Yes, and Arkady on StartPpoint somehow mentioned that "There are good examples of projects that have passed all start-up infrastructure (Merry Farmer, etc.) and were not exposed to crash tests."  A large number of normal people (not freaks) did not want to participate in clowning.  Although Arkady on Friday said that SuW is not an "attraction of start-ups", but in my opinion, it looked like an attraction.  In any case, the format is more conducive to superficial communication, jokes, "get-together" and the like, but not effective work.  The conveyor of the presentations, run through the pipe experts, SketchFlow "on the fingers." <br><br>  Surprisingly, with all this, Glavstart makes participation in SuW a prerequisite for the provision of <a href="http://glavstart.ru/glavinvest.shtml">investment</a> .  I quote: "Only on the weekend do you have the opportunity to show yourself, your abilities and capabilities in real work - in the 54-hour marathon." <br><br>  The 54-hour marathon is not ‚Äúreal work‚Äù, but a strange thing on vegetable oil.  In total, about 70 projects of various levels were allowed to participate in the 4th Weekend.  This is very, very much.  Both for the participants themselves and for the experts.  And it is unclear exactly what benefits the marathon brought in this format.  The picture of the resources that were in one bottle turned out to be so mosaic that it could hardly have yielded any meaningful results. <br>  Why did you need to mix in one pile: <br><ul><li>  working resources (Workzilla, IdealLady); </li><li>  ‚Äúa la Victor Petrik‚Äù technologies (Universal Test Machine, Irbis, United Window for Borrowers, 100 Brands, Statistical Analyzer, Direct Sales); </li><li>  foggy developments in the style of "The Beetle-2" (Life Card, Volmy); </li><li>  sites ‚Äúgo there, I don‚Äôt know where, bring it, I don‚Äôt know what‚Äù (Newtryst, Unitoff, StartupCase, Contentis, Find.fm and many others); </li><li>  semi-fraudulent schemes or Lokhotron 2.0 (TiMoDo); </li><li>  clones (Apartama, Cloud CMS, Aggregator Stupon Sites, Mindtrack) </li></ul><br>  and normal ideas that their teams (creators) and experts should really think about in a calm environment (for example, Findpresent, ListenNews, DoReMi, ChooseaPlaceofRest, Road &amp; Listen, DreamStore, Surroservice)? <br><br>  Is it possible to compare the benefits that an adequate project can get in such a crowd of startups, or who will be in a one-on-one conversation with an expert or a group of experts?  It would have been better to have a normal preliminary selection of several dozen projects in order to focus the attention of experts and devote more time to the worthy ones. <br><br>  Although it is fun to control the air conditioner via twitter, as it was done on SuW.  Not sure, however, that the event was conceived just for a healthy laugh. <br><br>  German Klimenko, already mentioned above, correctly said: ‚ÄúPoints are a question of the show for the sake of the show.  Why should I bring a good idea to the party - I will take it for myself and implement it. ‚Äù <br><br>  In my opinion, a startup with a well-thought-out project idea and concept should understand that he has nothing to do in a crush.  This is especially true of owners of "non-technological" ideas that are not tied to a specific team of programmers.  Catching the illuminated idea, intelligent programmers blind their own project.  Without the participation of the founder. <br><br>  Therefore, if you want to earn, then forget about going to the festival.  If there‚Äôs an idea at the weekend, there‚Äôs no money.  The best way is ‚Äúcontractual‚Äù - we draw a prototype, work out the concept and stomp to an adequate investor.  Maximum for 50 thousand dollars, or even for a smaller amount.  Let him recommend programmers if he wants.  But it does not discard the founders. <br><br>  This was indirectly acknowledged by A. Moreynis, who offered to write to him directly to the email address and promised to arrange a pitch-event for one sane project with one listener - him. <br>  We need an adequate project leader who could implicitly answer investor questions, be able to listen to the advice of smart people and lead the project further, taking it as a personal emotion.  Not a boy in a suit.  Not a programmer who has no idea what to make.  Not familiar guy from the crowd. <br>  A Founder.  Anyone who, according to A. Moreinis, should: clearly understand what he is saying;  explain what he understands;  and whose eyes are burning. <br><br>  <b>I wish good luck to all those with good ideas.</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/113751/">https://habr.com/ru/post/113751/</a></p>
