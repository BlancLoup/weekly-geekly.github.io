On the other hand, companies are not ready to abandon the usual quality level of corporate phones. <br><br>  <b>In response to numerous requests from partners, Escene launches sales of new low-cost IP phones, with the most attractive price in the ES corporate lineup.</b> <br><br>  The compact office phone ES205, retains the quality features of the corporate line (cast tube, separate plastic round buttons, stand) for less money than the older models. <br>  The phone is made in a strict and elegant style, made of high quality materials, has a large clear screen, two independent lines, an intuitive interface in Russian, a large set of functions, two Ethernet ports and power over PoE (optional), and also supports voice transmission in HD quality.

delivered in a cardboard box, on the side of the package there is a sticker with the model number and barcode of the device.  Inside the phone is neatly packed, there is nothing superfluous in the box.  Obviously, this equipment reduces the cost of the phone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/55f/fb7/fce/55ffb7fce79246e9ec3228839703c4bd.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Packaging</font></i> <br><br>  <b>Phone kit</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Telephone set. </li><li>  Handset. </li><li>  Handset cord. </li><li>  RJ45 patch cord to connect to the network. </li><li>  Instruction and warranty card. </li><li>  Power supply <b>Escence AD200</b> <b>(for model ES205-N)</b> . </li></ul><br>  The delivery package for the <b>Escene ES205-PN</b> model is <b>missing the Escence AD200</b> power <b>supply unit</b> (5 volts), it must be ordered separately. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a2a/48e/a22/a2a48ea22d411b11356ef7131c5a4c55.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Phone</font></i> <br><br>  <b>Front panel and hardware buttons</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/130/901/e1f/130901e1f19bc855804cff161a552ba4.jpg"><br><br>  The buttons on the phone are less than on older models, but this does not nearly interfere with its configuration and use.  It seems that more buttons are not needed. <br><br>  Conventionally, there are three blocks of buttons: <br><br>  <b>1. The multifunction buttons</b> are four soft buttons under the phone screen, each of the multifunction buttons shows the function currently active, for example, ‚ÄúNew call‚Äù, end a call, ‚ÄúDo not disturb‚Äù, ‚ÄúCall transfer‚Äù and others. <br><br>  When navigating the menu, these buttons are also used for navigation, for example, ‚ÄúBack‚Äù, ‚ÄúEnter‚Äù and others, besides there are two navigation buttons ‚ÄúUp‚Äù and ‚ÄúDown‚Äù in the block and the multifunctional button for deleting the ‚ÄúC‚Äù symbol. <br><br>  <b>2. Line control buttons</b> - the phone has two independent SIP accounts (two SIP lines).  By default, outgoing calls are established from line 1, unless of course it is set up, if necessary to make a call from line 2, you need to press the line button, then dial the number ‚Äî the phone will send the call through the second SIP account.  The phone can accept two simultaneous calls.  The ‚ÄúLine 1‚Äù and ‚ÄúLine 2‚Äù buttons are the light indication, when a call arrives, the diode of the line to which the call is being received flashes.  If the line is busy, the line button is lit in red; if it is flashing, an incoming call has arrived.  If the line is green, an active call is on the line; if it is flashing, the call is held on the line. <br><br>  <b>3. Service buttons</b> - Redial redial button, two buttons for volume control and a speakerphone on button. <br><br>  <b>Back of phone</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/055/d48/bd7/055d48bd7b030a63d9abe36f0ed84d51.jpg"><br><br>  On the back of the phone is a standard sticker with the model number, serial number and MAC address.  If, for convenience, you need to bring the handset wires or power cables to the top of the phone, you can put them on the phone body, for this, there are two grooves on the panel. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f1f/cf8/39d/f1fcf839d4a57d0c597c9f2abf655d1b.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Installation stand</font></i> <br><br>  The phone stand is very easy to install - you need to align the lower guides of the stand with the slots in the phone case, then leaning on the lower guides to raise the stand counterclockwise until it clicks.  As can be seen from the image, the stand can be fixed in two positions. <br><br>  <b>Phone Interfaces &amp; Connectors</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e5a/bf0/872/e5abf08725cf9882a1ae9c3269a5f8c9.jpg"><br><br>  The first photo shows a block of interfaces.  For AC power using the power adapter, there is a 5 volt socket on the panel, a connector for connecting a tube with an RJ9 socket.  Two Ethernet interfaces - PC for connecting the phone to a computer and LAN for connecting to a local network and PoE power. <br>  Below in the image is a view of the back panel with the wires connected, I did not begin to remove them.  Wires do not interfere with the phone is exactly on the table and does not move during dialing, conversation and other actions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b2e/6f2/eec/b2e6f2eec8cb8967028002bf3f2f59b1.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Rear panel with connected wires</font></i> <br><br>  <b>View of the phone on the table</b> <br><br>  So the phone looks assembled, high-quality plastic, the screen backlight is missing, but the contrast of the text and the screen is quite bright.  When the phone first appears on the table, it feels how compact it is. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2e1/a28/4e6/2e1a284e66bf5be1385277c989deef50.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Phone screen</b> <br><br>  It is worth noting a nice screen with good resolution.  The phone has a monochrome LCD screen without backlight size 128 * 64, small, but its size is enough to easily read the information from the screen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7eb/cf6/124/7ebcf6124230809870eadae3edb1e0e7.jpg"><br><br>  This is how the phone screen with the registered line in Russian looks.  ‚ÄúLine1‚Äù and ‚ÄúLine 2‚Äù is an arbitrary label that is configured in the ‚ÄúSIP Accounts‚Äù menu and is called ‚ÄúLabel‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/65f/c71/d1c/65fc71d1cc8902fefeabd46c78a3ec0c.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Enter and dial numbers.</b>  When you enter a number, the numbers on the screen are large and readable.  When you enter the first digits of the phone number, it shows the most similar numbers by the dialed mask.  When dialing a number, the button of the line through which the number is dialed lights up in red. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/afb/f0c/749/afbf0c749ca69b415f22f7eeb784177a.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Incoming call.</b>  In addition to the beep and on-screen indications, when an incoming call is in progress, the button of the line to which the call has arrived flashes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/26b/083/139/26b0831393e864de91e2a742533a237d.jpg"><br><br>  <b>State of conversation.</b>  During a call, the line button is green.  There is a talk time timer on the screen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/428/f38/842/428f38842f57c9135a28bef16c8d8ed6.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Call logs.</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/72a/06d/058/72a06d0580c163964ea397366f212d3a.jpg"><br><br>  View of the menu on the phone screen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/98a/601/60f/98a60160f5730b5f8d15e69cddb5af19.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Phone setup </h2><br>  The phone can be configured either using the on-screen menu or using the web-based interface.  Unlike most phones from other manufacturers, which leave a minimum of settings in the phone menu and a larger number only through the web interface, the Escene developers decided to make available from the phone menu in addition to the standard settings, settings related to SIP accounts.  That is, the phone can be fully customized using the on-screen menu. <br><br>  Such a move is fully justified, in some cases, you can configure the phone faster.  In addition, sometimes there may be problems with access to the phone through a web-interface or it may be necessary to explain to an employee remotely how to reconfigure his phone.  It will be easier for an unprepared person to use the phone menu, rather than a web interface. <br><br>  <b>Initial setup using phone buttons</b> <br><br>  So, we turned on the phone, connected the LAN port to the local network that has access to the IP PBX.  Employee's computer through the cable connected to the PC port. <br><br>  Now we need to include the Russian language in the menu.  Press the softkey "Menu", it is located on the left below the screen, a menu will open.  Use the Up or Down navigation buttons to navigate the menu, press the corresponding button on the phone‚Äôs dialer or a soft button (for example, Enter) to select a menu item, use the Back button to return to the previous item. <br><br>  Next, press the number 3, which corresponds to the choice of the ‚ÄúSystem Settings‚Äù menu, then select ‚ÄúPhone Setting‚Äù (number 3), then ‚ÄúLanguage‚Äù (number 1), using the Up or Down buttons to select ‚ÄúRussian‚Äù and Click "OK" <br>  Then press the "C" button until you exit the menu. <br><br>  <b>Configure network settings:</b> <br><br>  Click "Menu", then select the "System Settings" menu (or press the number 3), number 2 - "Advanced Settings", the default password is empty, just click "OK".  If you need to configure a VLAN (menu item 2 - ‚ÄúNetwork‚Äù, 3 - VLAN), go to the appropriate menu and configure its ID and priority.  Next, select "Network", then "LAN port", by default, after loading the phone, a DHCP client is enabled, which is trying to obtain an IP address, therefore there must be a DHCP server on the network where the IP phone is located.  If all settings are correct, the phone will receive an IP address and will be ready for further configuration. <br><br>  If you need to use a static IP address, while in the ‚ÄúLAN port‚Äù menu, select ‚ÄúStatic‚Äù and click ‚ÄúOK‚Äù.  By default, the phone is configured with IP 192.168.0.149, to change the settings of the IP address, mask, gateway and DNS, use the menu buttons and navigation keys, after saving the settings, the phone will reboot.  I pay attention that in this menu ‚ÄúLAN port‚Äù you can configure the port for access to the web-interface, by default it is 80, and also the port for access to the phone via telnet. <br><br>  The PC port setting deserves special attention (Menu -&gt; Settings -&gt; Advanced Settings -&gt; Network -&gt; PC Port).  Here you can configure the network operation mode between the PC and LAN ports.  In bridge mode, this is a two-port switch with support for a separate tagged or untagged VLAN for a LAN or PC port.  If you set the ‚ÄúRouter‚Äù mode, the PC port is assigned an IP and a mask, the NAT address translation is enabled between the LAN and the PC, you can also enable the DHCP server.  Thus, the phone becomes also a router with NAT support. <br><br>  Now you need to check the correctness of the network settings and see the IP address that was assigned by DHCP, to do this, click "Menu", press the number 1 - "View status", use the Up or Down navigation buttons, find the IP assigned to the phone, in my case the IP address assigned by DHCP: 192.168.1.14 <br><br>  <b>Setting up additional phone features</b> <br><br>  All these settings are made in the ‚ÄúMenu‚Äù -&gt; ‚ÄúFunctions‚Äù (number 2) <br><br><ul><li>  ‚ÄúAuto Answer‚Äù allows you to set up an automatic answer to a call without lifting the handset. </li><li>  DND allows you to reject all calls when the subscriber is busy. </li><li>  The ‚Äúhot line‚Äù allows you to set automatic dialing of a given number immediately or with a set timeout. </li><li>  Call Forwarding allows you to set conditional and unconditional forwarding to specified numbers. </li><li>  Call waiting allows you to enable or disable the ability to take a second call during a call. </li></ul><br><h2>  Support for additional services (DVO) and programmable buttons </h2><br>  The phone supports two independent SIP accounts, that is, registration on two different IP PBXs.  At simultaneous registration of both lines, by default, the first line will be used.  To switch to the second line (it should be configured) and return to the first one, use the ‚ÄúLine 1‚Äù and ‚ÄúLine 2‚Äù buttons. <br><br>  I note that the phone supports two simultaneous calls, so to use simultaneous SIP registration on both lines in the SIP account settings for each line, you must set the "Number of lines used by the account" parameter to 1 (default value is 2).  That is, the device supports only two lines, you can distribute them at your discretion: either assign both lines to the first SIP account, or distribute one line to each SIP account and register both at the same time. <br><br>  As for the DVO, they all work correctly: <br><br><ul><li>  The "Confr" soft button allows you to transfer a call, the call transfer is implemented using the contact information in the SIP 302 Moved Temporarily message.  This message is currently supported by almost all IP PBXs on the market. </li><li>  The ‚ÄúTransfer‚Äù soft button - call transfer with consultation and blindly, also uses SIP 302 Moved Temporarily. </li><li>  The Hold button (also Pickup) allows you to either put a call on hold during a call or pick up a call.  By default, pressing this button triggers the standard 123 combination, it can be reassigned via the web interface in the menu ‚ÄúAdvanced settings‚Äù -&gt; ‚ÄúPhone settings‚Äù -&gt; ‚ÄúBasic‚Äù -&gt; ‚ÄúCalls‚Äù, ‚ÄúCall pickup code‚Äù parameter. </li><li>  The ‚ÄúRedial‚Äù button allows you to redial the last number. </li><li>  The ‚ÄúSpeakerphone‚Äù button allows you to turn on or off the speakerphone, answer the call with the speakerphone on, or end the call if the conversation is held over the speakerphone. </li><li>  ‚ÄúMute‚Äù button - allows you to turn off the microphone during a call.  An indication appears on the phone screen. </li></ul><br>  <b>To access call logs:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Method 1: Press the ‚ÄúJournal‚Äù button.

They should be made non-standard if the phone is on an untrusted network (for example, with an external IP address on the Internet). <br>  Also here you can configure Paging - group notification. <br><br>  <b>Menu "Network" -&gt; "PC port"</b> <br><br>  L2 switching is switched on by default between the LAN and PC ports of the telephone - the ‚ÄúBridge‚Äù mode.  The phone can switch to L3 routing mode ‚Äî a NAT address translation will start on the LAN port, an IP address will need to be configured on the PC port, and if necessary, a DHCP server must be enabled in which to set the pool of IP addresses for clients. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/38d/2c5/839/38d2c58390c64b8bf8d5a5aae02524d2.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">PC port setup.</font></i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ec0/2ae/55b/ec02ae55b315631df3a9e32ebdb08819.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">PC port in routing mode.</font></i> <br><br>  <b>Menu "Network" -&gt; "Advanced Settings"</b> <br><br>  <i>VPN Settings tab</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/766/06c/10f/76606c10fdb2fc0b2baa646e870672ec.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">VPN configuration</font></i> <br><br>  If you need to connect your phone via a secure VPN channel, this can be done directly from the phone, without buying additional equipment (for example, a VPN router), the phone supports L2TP and OpenVPN (SSL VPN).  This is a very useful feature for several reasons. <br><br>  Firstly, if you have several phones that need to be delivered to a remote office, there is no need to buy a VPN hub at each remote location, you just need to configure the VPN client built into the phone.  Further, through the tunnel to register his phone on the IP PBX in the central office. <br><br>  Secondly, VPN improves security, more and more administrators are thinking about how to protect terminals that are on the Internet, two problems are becoming more acute: the danger of hacking the terminal and the difficulty of accessing telecoms operators to configure it, because often the terminal is behind NAT.  Using a VPN client solves both of these problems, so this useful feature will become increasingly popular.  In the example, using the VPN type L2TP, a connection to the vpn.ucexpert.ru server was created. <br><br>  <i>VLAN Settings Tab</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0a1/c2a/b51/0a1c2ab51afe18f7512c0b97e396a20e.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">VLAN configuration</font></i> <br><br>  In a corporate network, it is recommended to isolate the computer network traffic from the voice network traffic, this is most often implemented using two VLANs.  The phone supports VLAN on both ports. <br><br>  <b>VoIP Settings</b> <br>  The phone allows you to manage a large number of SIP signaling settings and settings for RTP media traffic. <br><br>  <b>Menu "SIP accounts" -&gt; "Account 1"</b> <br><br>  <i>Tab "Basic"</i> <br>  In addition to the standard SIP account settings - User Name (UserID), Name (AuthID) and password, there is a ‚ÄúLabel‚Äù field, it allows you to insert an arbitrary line description that will be displayed on the phone screen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/760/02b/f63/76002bf636405fb830812ce3b239204f.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">SIP account setup</font></i> <br><br>  In addition to the primary IP address of the SIP server, you can add an additional IP SIP server.  In case of unsuccessful registration during the timeout, which by default is 32 seconds, the address of the additional SIP server will be used for registration.  The setting ‚ÄúNumber of lines used by the account‚Äù should be equal to 1 if you need to use both lines, because the second line must be assigned to the second account.  If you leave the value equal to 2, then when applying the settings of the second line, the phone will display a message that there are not enough lines. <br><br>  <i>Calls tab</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e21/eac/017/e21eac017f9c99b45474c3ba1ca618d4.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Additional SIP account settings</font></i> <br><br>  Here you can specify additional settings to overcome NAT, enable DNS SRV. <br><br>  <i>Security tab</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/894/47f/0b2/89447f0b214697729b460dc52246c690.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Encryption Setting</font></i> <br><br>  The phone supports encryption of RTP and SIP signaling traffic using TLS protocol. <br><br>  <b>Menu "Phone Settings" -&gt; "Basic"</b> <br><br>  <i>Tab "Basic"</i> <br><br>  Here you can configure various functions of the phone, such as the ‚ÄúHotline‚Äù - when you pick up the handset, the preset number is automatically dialed, you can turn on auto-search in the address book during dialing and auto answer the call. <br><br>  The important setting is DTMF type - by default it is set to RFC2833. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/169/920/68d/16992068df5aca1caa28d1bf60fc3244.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Basic phone settings</font></i> <br><br>  <i>Calls tab</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/061/5a3/a01/0615a3a0106a2cec88ab70d1c2b32409.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Basic phone settings - Calls</font></i> <br><br>  In this menu, global functions for the phone are configured. <br><br>  If you set up the SIP settings here, they will be applied to both lines automatically, except for the settings ‚ÄúLocal SIP port‚Äù and ‚ÄúRTP port range‚Äù, which can be useful for properly configuring the firewall. <br><br>  In case the call transfer is required to be performed with a special key combination (old code), instead of the standard SIP message 302, this can be specified in the setting ‚ÄúSpecial code for call transfer‚Äù.  A useful setting that allows you not to break the connection in the conference, if it left the initiator.  You can set call forwarding by condition (busy and ‚Äúno answer‚Äù) and unconditional. <br><br>  Here you can also set codes that will be transmitted when you press the ‚ÄúPickup‚Äù buttons (the value in the ‚ÄúCall Pickup Code‚Äù field) and ‚ÄúVoice Mail‚Äù (the value in the ‚ÄúVoice Mail Number‚Äù field). <br><br>  Intercept the call in three ways: <br><br><ul><li>  Assigning a function to one of the buttons on the phone. </li><li>  Using an explicit dialing combination on the phone keypad. </li></ul><br>  The important setting is ‚ÄúReturn Code on Failure‚Äù and ‚ÄúReturn Code at DND‚Äù, by default IP PBX returns SIP message 603 Decline, these messages can be changed to others, if necessary for correct interpretation of the reason for the release. <br><br>  <i>Tab "Forwarding VOIP calls"</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f8b/892/3a3/f8b8923a30ec5336f9cd777c0afbfed0.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Call Forwarding</font></i> <br><br>  The tab is set forwarding: unconditional, if the subscriber did not answer or the line is busy. <br><br>  <b>Menu "Phone Settings" -&gt; "Advanced Settings"</b> <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúSound - Basic‚Äù and ‚ÄúSound - Extended‚Äù tabs</i> <br><br>  Here you can set the volume of the telephone, speaker and ringing tone.  Also, the volume settings of the microphone tube and speakerphone.  By default, when calling, the phone claims all possible codecs.  If necessary, unused codecs can be disabled.  Here you can enable echo cancellation and VAD.  Moreover, you can download your own ringtone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/742/9cf/381/7429cf38148f3a3da7b01a5ad1c6329f.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Media setup</font></i> <br><br>  <i>Line tab</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/427/106/5d1/4271065d163c294af3ea9c5b611ffbc6.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Customize line button functions</font></i> <br><br>  The Account selection menu can take the values ‚Äã‚ÄãAccount1 / Account2 / Any and becomes active if the button is assigned a dialing mode, for example, speed dial, DTMF or speed dial prefix. <br><br>  <i>Function Keys Tab</i> <br>  In this menu, you can assign an action to the function buttons of the phone if the actions they perform by default for some reason should be different.  To do this, in the drop-down menu of the choice, specify the action that will be performed when you press the button. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2e4/556/100/2e45561006f1e50dd890eeffbf886777.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Setting the function buttons</font></i> <br><br>  <b>Soft keys</b> <br>  Allows you to manage the sets of soft buttons that appear on the phone screen depending on the state of the phone (handset is on, handset is off, connected, talking, etc.) This is a very useful feature that allows you to control the functions available to the user. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2a6/1fd/d88/2a61fdd8848156472cdb72f38cc99980.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Customize soft buttons</font></i> <br><br>  <b>Menu "Phonebook"</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/749/5d9/4be/7495d94be628fd22217ade26891891bd.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Internal phone book</font></i> <br><br>  The phone has a built-in phone book, which is quite advanced.  It allows you to store up to 300 contact entries, each of which can store up to 3 phone numbers.  Entries can be made via the phone's on-screen menu using the web-based interface.  To download or save an already-created phone book in XML format, use the Phone Service menu -&gt; Update over HTTP -&gt; XML Phone Book; here you can save or load the phone book in XML format. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3ba/123/e09/3ba123e0961de07d41a1dcf5e05f1134.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">LDAP Corporate Book Setup</font></i> <br><br>  If your company uses an LDAP server, you can connect a phone to it and synchronize corporate contacts.  2 and 3 protocol versions are supported, as well as using the ‚ÄúLDAP Lookup For Incoming Call‚Äù and ‚ÄúLDAP Lookup For PreDial / Dial‚Äù settings, you can search for the contact name for an incoming and outgoing call.  If the contact is in the LDAP directory, then its name will be automatically added to the number. <br><br>  The phone also supports blacklists or ban lists: an unwanted phone number is added to such a list and can no longer reach you. <br><br><h2>  Service Settings </h2><br>  <b>Menu "Phone Settings" -&gt; "Basic"</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6ed/5b9/433/6ed5b94337c4b247b4864d8dc41da87d.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Update and backup your phone</font></i> <br><br>  You can copy configuration files using three different protocols.
