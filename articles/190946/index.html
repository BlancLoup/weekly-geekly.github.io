  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Does your company have an electronic knowledge base?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Each employee is a carrier of certain knowledge - it can be knowledge of technology, architecture, technical contacts, skills, current development status, plans for the future and much more.  This all makes up the knowledge base. <br>  Knowledge in electronic form is documentation for products in several formats (for developers, for testers, for technical support, for end users), documentation for technology and development techniques, lists of technical and business contacts, history of correspondence, orders, announcements, and so on. <br><br>  I think it‚Äôs not a big lie if I say that transfer of knowledge to electronic form is not practiced.  Because there is no experience, this is not accepted, there are no technical means, another thousand reasons do not allocate time for this.  It turns out that most of this knowledge is stored in the heads of employees or, perhaps, in notebooks, but not on electronic media.  To transfer such knowledge is difficult. <br>  Or maybe I'm wrong? <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      From <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2591%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9">Wikipedia</a> : <br><blockquote>  The main goal of creating such bases is to help less experienced people to find an existing description of how to solve a problem. </blockquote><br><br>  One of the scenarios of how I see myself working with the knowledge base: <br>  Vasya goes on vacation, Petya partially replaces him.  An old client, Ivan Ivanovich, who had communicated with Vasya before, addressed Petya with a technical problem.  Can Petya see Ivan Ivanovich‚Äôs correspondence with Vasya, determine the current state of their negotiations or the history of a technical problem?  Can he independently find the answer in the knowledge base and solve the problem of Ivan Ivanovich. <br><br>  Or this: Vasya became cool and he was promoted or even transferred to another branch.  Peter will work instead of Vasya.  So Petya needs to know what Vasya was doing, where he stopped, to which everything had to come. <br><br>  The third option: expanded the staff of administrators, Vasya and Peter - junior, got a job with a difference of 2 weeks.  And the technical leader was sent for a month for refresher courses and can tell you the technical details of the work by phone or on Skype, but he doesn't want to tell the same thing twice. <br><br>  But the most unpleasant option for the company: Vasya quit, he is running out of two weeks of work, and he hasn‚Äôt yet found a replacement for Petya.  Existing employees do not have the qualifications of Vasya or are busy with urgent tasks from which it is impossible to distract.  In general, Vasya left. <br><br>  As a result, it only seems that the person is a cog and there are no irreplaceable ones.  By skills - yes, you can find someone with the same skills.  A new programmer will be able to program, an analyst will use Microsoft Visio, an office manager will receive mail.  And in terms of the volume of the corporate knowledge base there will be a loss.  The new programmer will do everything in Ruby, the system analyst will design new modules without taking into account the existing technical solutions, the office manager will forget to congratulate his colleagues on his birthday :) <br><br>  Once I watched as about 2% of the team left the company in 2 months, namely managers and the technical department.  Personally, I, an ASP web application developer, had to deal with technical issues of IP-telephony of the Radius packet trace level and debugging of C ++ code.  I could not find the arguments and confidence in the voice to refuse.  And I remembered almost nothing of what the departing people tried to convey to me in 4 hours of a continuous stream of consciousness.  Did I become a qualified specialist in 4 hours?  Can I fully replace them and at least fix current technical problems, and even more so develop the direction of development? <br><br>  Personally, it bothers me.  I want to rely on my colleagues, I want them to be able to replace me even in difficult issues.  And likewise I want to be their reliable support.  Otherwise, this may lead to such a situation as the transfer of leave to an inconvenient time, or in the case of time trouble, you will have to deal with two or three problems at the same time.  Therefore, with the consent of the management, accumulation of information about research, technical solutions, negotiations protocols, even a record of negotiations, documentation for developers and users is stored in the wiki.  Not the most convenient place to store media information (in fact, these are all attachments to articles), but better than nothing. <br>  According to the results of work, experience exchange, meetings between parties, seminars are held.  Not so often and not on all issues as we would like, but this is better than nothing at all. <br><br>  Do you share your knowledge? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/190946/">https://habr.com/ru/post/190946/</a></p>
