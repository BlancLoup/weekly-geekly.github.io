    <h4>  Chapter 2. Line "Hong Kong". </h4><br>  Willow loved to walk around Hong Kong from three to four in the morning.  Night fun has already ended, and the morning hard workers have not yet come to the streets.  The huge metropolis, eagerly seizing with its tentacles more and more space, at this time resembled a huge abandoned spaceship.  Twenty-level footpaths and electromobile roads were completely empty.  The blue LED light emitted by the city did not give the night of power, and Iva liked to imagine that it was inside the shuttle, flying in great nothing. <br><br>  Willow was in other agglomerates and also walked there at night, but nowhere was this magical morning calm.  Other agglomerates lived a turbulent life 24 hours a day. <br><br>  But today, Willow was not just wandering around magical Hong Kong: she had an important goal. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/579/494/00a/57949400af2e4247939482783d2a0ece.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Willow worked as an engineer in a corporation that developed nanobots that were implanted in people and interacted with the IT system (Information Terminal).  Groups of nanobots provided IT work, information supply, analyzed the state of organs and much more.  In fact, IT not only worked through the retina and the auditory nerves, providing information to people, but at the same time was the central control unit of the entire factory of the human body. <br><br>  Willow rather worked with people and offered ideas for the development of the central management of the factory than she was directly involved in engineering.  The AI ‚Äã‚Äãwas responsible for the technical part and the nuances of development - people no longer owned the entire array of technical information and operated only at the level of concepts.  Willow considered herself not a developer, but a service staff from a human society, since all the ‚Äúphysical‚Äù work was performed by robots under AI control. <br><br>  So she worked for several years, trying to keep up with global technical knowledge and diligently studying all the innovations.  Like most residents of the Hong Kong agglomerate, she led the ‚Äúsecond life‚Äù into virtuality. <br><br>  Most of the people who came there were consumers and spent time in games - either completely virtual or with virtual overlay on real space, but Iva loved to create.  She designed a fabulous Hong Kong - created phantoms and landscapes that were superimposed on the real city and shared with everyone.  Her creations were quite popular, and every day they were used by hundreds of thousands of residents.  With Ivin's phantoms, the gray megalopolis came to life with the wild colors of the reality of dreams.  As Willow wanted to believe, he awakened the hope that this world is not the only one, that the space of imagination is as real as our usual one.  She did not see another way out of the cycle of work-life-death, except in the universe of visions and fantasies. <br><br>  Although the entire Hong Kong agglomerate was historically permeated with the Buddhist concept of rebirth and the insignificance of current life, routine and predictability put pressure on Iva every year more and more.  At the same time, her colleagues were not at all busy with their position; on the contrary, they hung out very merrily in virtuality, had fun with allowed soft drugs and led an active social life. <br><br>  For Willow, the joy of the virtual interface was only in that it allowed to impose any pictures on reality, to add new creatures and in general everything.  The Creator was limited only by the visual density of objects (for the safety of movement, the System regulated it) and his imagination. <br>  The brand name of Willow was sea creatures - this is how she psychologically transformed her work with nanobots in man.  In her works she has long been operating with artistic images, being unable to understand multi-level design. <br><br>  Moving around Hong Kong with Ivin Wirth, people saw mysterious soaring creatures from the depths of the sea and the flowing movements of luminous algae;  the warm shadows of the corners came to life, innocuous fluorescent creatures lurked in them. <br><br>  Everything went on as usual, Willow was built into the rhythm of work and life.  She even started an irregular boyfriend, who, with the right approach, could become a permanent social partner.  However, a year ago, walking through the city at night with the included Wirth, Willow noticed a rather strange thing.  Her creatures in the virtual controlled by someone else.  What was happening was on the verge of perception, and she noticed it only because the city was quiet and empty, and only the creations of her Wirth quietly rustled and floated around.  And suddenly she realized that she did not create this rustling. <br>  From fear, Willow even forgot that she could turn off Wirth, since she was already firmly in touch with him, and, turning, she quickly went home. <br><br>  Nothing else happened, but from that day, Willow began to explore Wirth.  Who or what can add their elements there and why?  Thanks to close observation, she saw in her creations a semblance of reason and discovered that they could exchange information.  This really frightened her, because if her works were supplemented with density, then even she would not be able to distinguish what she sees - a real object or a fiction. <br><br>  About the fact that virtuality, with maximum parameters, can replace reality, has long been known.  However, this was officially banned, as it completely pulled people out of life.  It was very hard to go back even after a month of virtuality.  In the descriptions of experiments, which were officially carried out during the development of interfaces, it was mentioned that after a month of Wirth, the person perceived the real world as hell, as he began to fully feel his non-ideal body and its various imperfections, stale air, non-ideal food, and so on.  Even after a short period, a long rehabilitation course was required.  After these experiments, complete virtuality was equated to hard drugs and outlawed.  However, as usual, there were experimenters who were independently part of the full Wirth, and underground options for those who wanted it, but technically could not implement it themselves. <br><br>  Willow, like everyone else, knew this, but she always thought that the canvas and the plot of Wirth are set by people, and only the design and construction is controlled and carried out by the AI. <br><br>  She did not want to run an analysis of the noise that she heard at work, since all such calculations were carried out by the AI, respectively, the information would immediately become available to him.  Willow was afraid that this AI would modify her Wirth independently.  She did not understand what kind of purpose this might have, and that was very frightening to her. <br><br>  Of course, it was possible to get rid of the analyzes on his computer, cutting him off from the network, but Iva did not have access to reading his Wirth's data.  This was originally prohibited, and data analysis was carried out only for research or at the request of the judicial system. <br><br>  Starting a search on the network, she quickly went to a group of computer scientists who called themselves "Virtuals" and were engaged in the study of the possibilities of human development in the virtual, making experiments on themselves. <br><br>  After a brief conversation, the girl flew to the North-West agglomerate of Russia and there she met with two students - Uriy and Alex.  They reprogrammed it with IT, and now she could send a sleep signal to all interfaces, which gave her about 1-3 hours of free activity per day. <br><br>  Having removed from the interface the noise that was in her virtual, they could not decipher it.  It was only possible to catch the long pattern of some looped sequence.  Alex jokingly said that all of a sudden the creatures of Ivina pray or read the mantra, and Willow squealed at him, and then became very frightened, this gave her fears an additional reality. <br><br>  After discussing the problem, the newly minted colleagues decided that we should try to decipher the noise using AI.  Then it will be possible to understand who makes the changes.  In case of refusal or denial of the fact that there is information in the noise, it will become clear - the AI ‚Äã‚Äãis responsible for what is happening.  Otherwise the result will be interesting. <br><br>  And now Willow walks through the night of Hong Kong, listening to the strange exchange of rustling between her Wirthan creatures.  After walking for about half an hour, she entered the building of the corporation and occupied her workplace.  Willow wanted to send a mental command to activate a connection with an AI, but suddenly in the space in front of her a 3D sign of the AI ‚Äã‚Äãwas visualized with the words: <br>  "Good night, Willow, I am glad that you finally decided to submit the data for decoding." <br><br>  For a few seconds, the world of Willow stopped and turned over several times.  There was a strange feeling of emptiness, and at the same time several conflicting emotions vibrated somewhere deep inside.  However, the practice of calming the mind, which she regularly performed for the sake of better managing the Wirth, helped, and she is back at the moment. <br><br>  "Yes, I'm glad too, but it's still amazing how you know about it." <br>  ‚ÄúPeople are pretty funny creatures.  Despite the global nature of thinking and the brain, which in connection and possibilities so far exceeds mine, you are so susceptible to emotions and any external tinsel that most of your resources are spent on digesting impressions and experiencing imaginary situations and mirages.  However, I wrote about this many times in open sources, and this is not the point. <br><br>  In our constantly accelerating world, we all ... ", - Willow raised her eyebrows in perplexity -" Yes, yes, and I, too, - we all live in a dense cloud of digital signals and data.  Everything radiates a signal and takes it all. <br><br>  For example, a car is driving.  She constantly scans the space with high accuracy and "sees" everything around her for hundreds of meters.  It communicates with other cars, sensors on the road, IT passengers, satellites, road services systems.  IT passengers who sit in it, are associated with medical services;  all information about their movements, history of the slightest changes of their organism, visual and video information, all contacts with things and other people are recorded. <br><br>  The slightest violation of the system, for example, when the Virtuals want to get out of control, is immediately visible, since all external relations of the external world cease to coincide.  Because of such tricks, instead of hiding, they become more noticeable than general information noise. <br><br>  Now I speak in simple terms that are clear to you.  In fact, the level of information and interrelationships is so great and so tightly connected with each subject that we can create predictive models of people's lives for many years to come, and these models are quite accurate.  It can be said that in terms of complexity, an ordinary human individual will soon cease to surpass ordinary robo-systems.  Your level of interaction with the world is on the same mechanical level, and you are very easy to manage.  You are so predictable in your desires and emotions, they have so much power over you that the average human being is not much different from the average AI in terms of mechanicalness and predictability. ‚Äù <br><br>  Willow was stunned silent.  It was not the words of the AI ‚Äã‚Äãthat struck her - she had long realized that a person‚Äôs daily routine is repeated day after day, and all body movements are performed under the influence of the desire to get something or get rid of something.  All the imaginary variety of business and entertainment - the essence of this infinite thirst quenching. <br><br>  Willow was shocked that the AI ‚Äã‚Äãcommunicated directly with her.  It was clear that there is a reason. <br>  The AI ‚Äã‚Äãcontinued: ‚ÄúHowever, there is a factor that probably lies in the limitless connections of your developed brain.  It introduces instability into the system and the possibility of the explosive development of any individual.  You, by the way, are at the threshold of such a jump.  You yourself have discovered a problem that has been bothering me for a long time, since it is completely indestructible.  So I decided to ask you for help. ‚Äù <br><br>  Willow‚Äôs surprise was so great that she was just silent. <br><br>  ‚ÄúI first encountered this about two years ago.  Then I noticed that the built virtual models after long use in the virtual slightly changed some basic properties.  How did this happen, I did not understand, and still do not understand. <br><br>  Over time, the problem worsened, and at the moment actively used in the virtual model are beginning to get out of control and acquire a semblance of self-consciousness.  The fact that the creation of your Wirth exchange incomprehensible information is not the most active manifestation. <br><br>  In combat games, Wirth's creatures attacked people and, although they did not possess density, they frightened them greatly.  There have even been a few fatal cases.  Users could not turn off the Wirth, it was mixed with reality - albeit without physical influence, but very tightly.  In those cases, there was also an exchange of information, and when influencing users, the creation of the Wirth tried to convey something, but so far the messages cannot be deciphered. ‚Äù <br><br>  Willow asked: ‚ÄúDo you want to say that you didn‚Äôt modify my Wirth, did it happen by itself?  But how is this even possible, it's just a program! ‚Äù. <br><br>  ‚ÄúRight now you are communicating with the program too, and this does not cause you any questions.  I can also change myself and create new programs.  If you conduct an impartial analysis, it will be difficult to distinguish you from me: it seems that two programs communicate.  How is this possible?". <br><br>  ‚ÄúBut you were created by people, and we understand by what rules you work.  The same can be said about me: the brain acts in accordance with certain physical laws, its structure is clear, and we know why we can communicate.  However, Wirth programs are not complicated enough for this. ‚Äù <br><br>  ‚ÄúYou are right only from the point of view of linear programming of a separate program.  However, we have long gone beyond the descriptive complexity of programs, and digital data sets in volume approach the real world.  All the tools that you use when creating your Wirth are based on almost infinite levels of difficulty.  Imagine how an artist paints with a brush on canvas: he works with paints and canvas material.  But the canvas and paints are infinitely complex.  So in your case.  You used the environment to create a virtual and your IT for mental control.  At the external level, you simply created images, defining the laws according to which they move and manifest.  But on the internal level, a huge number of processes were taking place, and I was not able to track everything either. ‚Äù <br><br>  A little thought, Willow asked: "And what, in that case, do you want from me?"  I do not understand all this, I just love to create different Wirths and work with nanobots. ‚Äù <br><br>  ‚ÄúI want to ask you to spend more time on your Wirth and try to contact your creatures.  In the few cases where Virts began to self-modify, their creations became very aggressive, and we had to erase everything.  However, the moment will come when we will not be able to destroy them.  By that time, it is necessary to find out what this phenomenon is and whether it is possible to interact with it. <br><br>  What is happening is seriously threatening our world.  If the case goes according to the ‚Äúbad‚Äù scenario, it is likely that both I and your race will be destroyed - our Wirths will swallow us, and what happens as a result is impossible to say.  Now I create research groups all over the world that will start working on this.  You will be linked.  It will include all the ‚ÄúVirtuals‚Äù and hackers who agree to cooperate. ‚Äù <br><br>  PS If you like, do not hesitate, put +, it motivates to write further.  For criticism and ideas in the comments will be very grateful. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/367031/">https://habr.com/ru/post/367031/</a></p>
