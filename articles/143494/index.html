  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Features of the culture of teaching in universities on computer specialties</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h5>  Teaching is a complex science. </h5><br>  No matter what subject you decide to teach, be it economics, philosophy, ecology or computer science.  Each science has its own peculiarities and difficulties in understanding between a student and a teacher.  Even with the practice of public speaking or communication in classrooms, classes, you did not get the experience in the form that is needed for teaching.  I would like to tell you today about the features and some approaches to improving the culture of teaching. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/600/785/74d/60078574dbd07a24c03c78827edce328.png" align="left"><br><br><h5>  Examples for solving difficult situations and successful teaching. </h5><br>  At the moment, computer science is developing much faster than all the others, and this is the stumbling block when trying to train specialists efficiently and quickly.  Every month new technologies appear that can be put on a semester course.  At the same time, the training system remained old, completely inflexible and unsuitable for such frequent changes in the program.  Such a program cannot be changed, it is much easier to do something local, which will help solve local problems in the context of one course. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h5>  Well forgotten approach.  Dynamic teaching. </h5><br>  Many have found a way out for themselves, for example, in the framework of one program, one course of lectures, to read several blocks of information from related topics and technologies.  This approach is the most appropriate in this situation.  Naturally, in each innovative approach there are difficulties, which will be discussed below.

      <b>Unwillingness to change the program</b> , and as a result, the provision of outdated material, or knowledge in a narrow technology, which will not be relevant at the end of the course or knowledge, which will be aloof from the overall picture and will not fit into the student's idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcomputer science.  The second problem is the wrong manner of teaching several related topics that are interconnected and are inherently inseparable from each other.  As a result, the student ceases to be in line with the subject and is lost, forgetting the purpose of the course, loses attention and interest. <br><br>  Even if the <b>teacher is enthusiastic and determined to</b> provide students with knowledge, both theoretical and practical, he may encounter other difficulties on the way to a good lecture.  A good lecture means a lecture in which the group is actively involved in the preparation process, the material that they are provided with interesting and useful. <br><br>  It is necessary to apply some techniques in order to establish contact with the audience for a quality learning process. <br><br><h5>  A set of techniques </h5><br>  <b>Teaching several disciplines is a difficult task</b> that far from all experienced teachers, not to mention beginners, can solve, since it is necessary to be aware of many subjects and directions.  Knowledge should be deep, and in rare cases, superficial, you should not start a conversation on a topic in which knowledge, at the discretion of the lecturer, is not sufficient for a good discussion. <br><br>  <b>Pre-describe the structure of</b> all that you want to tell about all related technologies, just make it short so that students have a common understanding and a map of a future lecture.  It is important for the analytical mind to draw a diagram. <br><br>  One should be <b>savvy in computer humor and modern trends</b> , in which all students of computer specialties are located, one should possess humorous terminology and methods of its application in practice, so that it is clear to the listener with an analytical mindset.  Try to joke more intellectually, those who understand your humor will laugh and understand that the joke was intellectual, those who do not understand will not laugh, but because of those who will laugh it will only listen more attentively to you. <br><br>  <b>Own news from the field of information systems</b> that are relevant today, yesterday and tomorrow, try to always have in your head a picture of the computer world, about languages, hardware, software, about new technologies, about cloud computing and data storage, about new companies and products.  Yes, such a large amount of information is very difficult to put into your head at once, but systematic exercises can help increase your horizons in different areas.  It is necessary to choose several information resources, portals with the latest news and trends in the computer sphere, and devote some time to it every day.  Soon you will see how wide the stock of knowledge in the field of information technology has become. <br><br>  <b>Practice constantly</b> .  Information technology is not a field in which theoretical knowledge drawn from a book can be a foundation for building a fortress.  After any dry theory, practice should follow, preferably practice from life with examples and stories about how this happened.  If there is no such possibility, then it is easy to explain with simple examples how this or that theory can be used in practice.  Do not forget about this, because sometimes the teachers themselves do not have a clear idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhere exactly, and how you can really apply the knowledge that they teach. <br><br>  In the continuation to the last paragraph, I would like to add that <b>my own practical experience</b> , real work experience in commercial projects, when the theory is sufficiently distorted under the influence of time, budget and mood of the team of people you work with, will be a big <b>plus in teaching</b> .  As is known, practice differs from theory, and in the case of the information sphere, this difference is even more significant.  If you have practical experience, then you should say about it at the very beginning of the lectures, first of all, it will increase your credibility in front of the audience, as most students are eager to work in their field and are well aware that a person who has practical skills will be able to give more than the one that does not possess them, and secondly, in difficult situations you can always refer to the practical side of reality, no matter how beautiful everything is in theory, but practice is practice.  True practice is not always ideal when developing software, and this should be amended. <br><br>  In addition to computer interests, <b>it is necessary to have several related</b> , for example, something from sports and / or cars to expand their horizons, as well as to increase the attention of students, as the monotonous and unidirectional story about computer technology becomes half-hourly ordinary and boring.  Find time for digressions and inserts from other industries, it can be like humor, as well as practical examples, can be like your experience, and the experience of your colleagues. <br><br>  <b>Do not think that the teacher facing the students is smarter than themselves.</b>  This will be a big mistake, especially when arguing with students.  Especially since in reality it is impossible to be a professional in all areas, at least not enough time for this, most likely, you will have knowledge in one or two areas deep enough to qualitatively parry questions, but this does not mean that in all areas you You can give them the right answers.  Imagine that you are sitting in front of colleagues, to whom you are telling only what you yourself are an expert in, and in all related fields go to a calm and equal discussion of issues.  Argue only if you are 100% sure of yourself, and even in this case it is better to avoid this, since regardless of the outcome of the dispute, the opinion of the audience may not be comforting. <br><br>  <b>Cite as an example Best Practices.</b>  In doing so, try to qualitatively argue your arguments about the fact that this is the best known way to solve a particular problem.  Your task in the teaching process is to educate students, teach them to think and make practical decisions. <br><br>  <b>Never forget your main line in a lecture</b> .  You can move right or left, but do not forget what you started with and what you want to finish.  Teaching with the structure in the form of a tree is not always appropriate in computer science, as the result may be what has <b>been said about everything and nothing</b> .  Pulling aside for an interesting example or joke, always return to the topic. <br><br>  <b>Offer more logic tasks</b> , during which rivalry and competition within the group can awaken, naturally, it is worth encouraging on the one hand, and on the other hand, not to bring it to the only way of teaching. <br><br><h5>  Conclusion </h5><br>  It is a very important stage to understand what the teacher stopped to explain, and what the student stopped to understand, you can once again recall the structure of the entire lecture and summarize it with practical examples from life or practice.  In the course of the lecture, do not forget to receive feedback from the audience with questions or jokes. <br><br>  An audience with a computer mindset differs from others by a faster grasp of the material, and consideration of the issue from different points of view.  This should be taken into account when preparing for teaching, since one question can grow completely into another and it will be quite logical, one topic after 5 minutes may look completely different, and it will be logically connected. <br><br>  <b>Do not underestimate every new audience</b> in front of which you speak, they all have good knowledge, maybe in a narrow field of activity, not always in the context of information technology, but their mindset will allow you to insert your opinion into any dispute. <br><br>  I am sure that many use the above techniques, and can evaluate them in full, sometimes without even thinking about what they use them. <br><br>  Thank you for your attention.  I hope for constructive criticism. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/143494/">https://habr.com/ru/post/143494/</a></p>
