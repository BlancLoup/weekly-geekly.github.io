  <section class="page js-page"><h1>New information technologies in the field of management</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ca1/7e6/60b/ca17e660b771457caffb75065d9cbb56.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The increase in the volume of information and large changes in the demand for information have begun to place new demands on the organization of information and documentation services in the organization. <br>  Requirements for information and document support services began to change.  Abroad, they were called the service of management (or management) information and documentation resources, in our country, the service of documentation management of management (DOW). <br>  The main direction of improving the DOE, adapting it to modern conditions was the use of the latest computer and telecommunications technology, the formation on its basis of highly efficient information and management technologies in working with documents. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Today, the state of information technology in preschool educational institutions can be characterized: <br>  ‚Ä¢ the presence of a large amount of databases containing information about the activities of the organization; <br>  ‚Ä¢ creation of technologies that provide interactive user access to information resources; <br>  ‚Ä¢ expansion of the functionality of information systems and technologies that provide information processing, the creation of local multifunctional problem-oriented information systems for various purposes; <br>  One of the main factors influencing the scientific and technical progress on all spheres of human activity is the widespread use of new information technologies.  Among the most important and massive areas in which information technology plays a crucial role, a special place is occupied by the sphere of management.  Under the influence of new information technologies, fundamental changes are taking place in management technology (processes of substantiation and decision-making are being automated, organization of their implementation), and the skills and professionalism of specialists engaged in management activities are increasing. <br>  The scope of application of new information technologies based on personal computers and developed means of communication is very extensive.  It includes various aspects, from ensuring the simplest functions of official correspondence to system analysis and support for complex decision-making tasks.  Personal computers, laser and optical equipment, media and various types of communication (including satellite communications) allow institutions, enterprises, companies, organizations, work teams and individual specialists to receive the necessary information for the implementation of professional, educational, cultural and similar purposes. <br>  The meaning of the information provision is the organic combination of scientific knowledge, scientific methodology and methodology with the latest technical tools in all manifestations of information work. <br>  In automatic systems, the information process can be implemented without human intervention.  However, in automated systems, the mandatory collaborator of the information process is a person. <br>  Information technology is a system of methods and means of implementing information processes, as well as ways to use these tools.  So, for example, a modern system focused on the process of electronic document circulation offers: <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Reduction of access time to information</b> - electronic document circulation allows to avoid paper movement of documents.  Any document can be sent by e-mail or at the expense of the communication means of the electronic document management system. <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Reducing duplication of documents and information</b> - in the electronic document management system, one copy of the document may be available to all authorized users, including users who are outside the organization. <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Simplify access to data</b> - electronic document management systems allow you to access the necessary data through the search and export of data directly from business systems (such as CRM or ERP systems). <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Optimize document and data</b> storage ‚Äî a single data store reduces the need to store multiple copies of documents.  Access and indexing of documents that use electronic document management systems, allows users to instantly access the necessary documents and other information. <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Automation of business processes</b> - electronic document management systems involve the execution of a given document processing process.  Based on actions with documents, business applications can be automatically updated, new documents created, and communication with internal and external users established. <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Improving customer service quality</b> - due to quick access to the necessary information, customers can quickly receive answers to their inquiries. <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Improving discipline and quality of work</b> - electronic document management systems set strict rules and procedures for employees.  The system will not allow employees to violate these rules.  All documents are stored in the system, have the necessary identification and order of movement.  Employees will not be able to change the state of the document without performing the specified actions. <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Reuse of information</b> - due to electronic processing and storage of information, it becomes possible to reuse data entered into the system.  For example, when filling out sample forms or reporting. <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Improving data quality</b> - in electronic document management systems, many forms and documents are filled in automatically, which reduces the risk of errors.  In addition, it reduces the number of repeated checks of documents and their corrections. <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Improving the security of documents and information</b> - at the expense of access control, you can strictly control employee access to information and documents.  The presence of a single database allows you to archive and restore information in a short period of time. <br><br>  Information technology should be focused on reducing the complexity of the processes of using the information resource, as well as increasing their reliability and efficiency.  In organizational systems apply automated information technology, that is, human-machine technology.  Of all types of human-machine technologies, information technologies in the management sphere place the highest demands on the ‚Äúhuman factor‚Äù, exerting a fundamental influence on the qualifications of an employee, the content of his work, physical and mental stress, professional perspectives and the level of social relations. <br>  Specific new information technology for its implementation requires the presence of: <br>  ‚Ä¢ a set of relevant technical means implementing the information process itself; <br>  ‚Ä¢ systems of control facilities of the technical complex (for computer equipment, this is software); <br>  ‚Ä¢ organizational and methodological support linking the implementation of all actions of technical equipment and personnel into a single technological process in accordance with the purpose of a specific information process within the framework of ensuring a certain function of management activities. <br>  Thus, management activities are based on the implementation of all the listed types of information technologies in accordance with the sequence and content of the individual stages of the decision-making process.  Therefore, modern information technologies for providing management activities are based on the integrated use of various types of information processes on the basis of a single technical complex, which is based on computer technology. <br><br><blockquote>  The article was published in 2012 or 2013 in a collection of articles by students of technical specialties. <br>  Despite the rapid development of IT in the field of preschool education, I still think that it has not lost its relevance to this day. <br>  Thanks for attention! </blockquote></div>
