  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The marketing department of an IT company and its performance</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently faced with an interesting situation.  Some companies take only one person for the position of Internet marketer, believing that a good specialist will do all the marketing work for the company.  Unfortunately, good and fast "mnogostanochniki" too great a rarity. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5d7/854/66d/5d785466dde547fba67bb1271e112629.jpg" alt="internet marketer duties"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Now in the IT sphere, the emphasis in marketing is not on brand management or PR, as it was before, but on internet marketing.  Internet marketers are already considered synonymous with SEO, director, content marketer, email marketer, SMM manager, PR, analytics, brand manager, mobile marketer, designer, coder and creative. <br><br>  I did not write enough texts for websites, but I spent many hours at the analytical work, so ‚ÄúI ask you to forgive my clutch‚Äù (¬© Pratchett).

      As in the correct scientific article, we first give the definition of my favorite position.  It would seem, well, that difficult: "Internet marketer is a person who uses all channels of marketing communications through the world wide web".  Now put the "four" for inaccuracies in the definition of the university textbook and go to the realities. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/03a/686/640/03a68664037347c0b86df9fc0f123beb.jpg" alt="internet marketer"><br><br>  In my opinion (a person who has worked in marketing for the last 5 years and did not stop learning), the Internet marketer should really have an idea about the 4P complex (and more) that the list of specialists mentioned at the beginning deals with.  But he may not be the only marketer in the company.  Only if you are not a small online store or a startup of several people.  If you still have a small IT company (up to 50 employees), for some employees there will be a maximum of 1-3 hours per day.  In this case, for the development of the company you need at least three marketing specialists: <br><br><ol><li>  Department head <br><ul><li>  strategy building; </li><li>  determining the ROI (return on investment in marketing) and its improvement; </li><li>  analysis of the market and competitors, other analytics (both in Internet marketing and in mobile marketing); </li><li>  coordination of tasks within the department and involvement of employees of other departments (in this case, programmers and web-designers) for some tasks; </li><li>  search for new communication channels; </li><li>  generation of ideas (in other words, creative for banners, videos, viral marketing); </li><li>  communication with customers, partners and contractors; </li><li>  full accountability for the work of the department and the performance of its work. </li></ul><br></li><li>  Internet marketer (SEO + context specialist) <br><ul><li>  analytics on website promotion; </li><li>  work with internal optimization (optimization of markup, linking and other factors); </li><li>  work with external optimizations (social signals, quality links, if you still have non-commercial inquiries); </li><li>  content marketing; </li><li>  generation of ideas; </li><li>  contextual advertising and improvement of its performance; </li><li>  reporting on your job site. </li></ul><br></li><li>  PR manager <br><ul><li>  direct marketing (mailing according to a well-thought-out strategy); </li><li>  SMM (not just maintaining groups in social networks, but also tracking returns from them); </li><li>  establishing contacts with thematic media; </li><li>  preparation of presentations and other promotional materials; </li><li>  generation of ideas; </li><li>  organizational activities (exhibitions, conferences, webinars, etc.); </li><li>  reports on your job site. </li></ul><br></li></ol><br><br>  You also need a high-quality content marketer / copywriter, but several freelancers often pick him up instead.  The above command is their TK.  Keep in staff such very expensive. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/12c/d0b/939/12cd0b939cef4dbf90b1b70d4be8dfd5.jpg" alt="marketing department in an IT company"><br><br>  I think this is more than enough to start.  As the workload grows, the number of necessary specialists will increase and it is better to take people with a narrow specialization into the company (see the list again at the beginning).  Everything seems to be pretty obvious.  But it turns out that a problem with this still exists, and there will be nothing more than that. <br><br>  We now turn to the indicators with which an effective marketing department should work. <br><br>  The other day I learned that my company had not previously evaluated the activities of an internet marketer with reference to business results.  To put it mildly, it struck me.  Let's go over internet marketing indicators that my colleagues have come up with not for beautiful reports. <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Number of leads</b> <br>  Lead is a potential client from Central Asia who approached us because the marketer was able to interest him (the client saw contextual advertising, the site had a cool and useful text, the product was clearly and succinctly presented at the exhibition, etc.).  Not so long ago even the lead generation service appeared.  Not cheap, but an excellent marketing feature.  It saves customers a lot of nerves and money in the short term, but a rare marketer is ready to provide it with 100% quality. <br>  Another important thing to note: when counting all the leads, you need to segment all applications by communication channels (you do not need to appropriate other people's merits).  It‚Äôs like two and two, it‚Äôs clear - the more customers, the bigger the company's profit. <br></li><li>  <b>Costs for 1 lead</b> <br>  This is the amount of money spent on attracting 1 application from a potential client.  This figure first appears to the marketer when launching an advertising campaign or buying other paid communication services.  In the extreme case, if you are too tight with the advertising budget, you can calculate this figure by dividing your salary by the number of customers you have attracted to the company.  Having identified costs for a lead for the first time, the marketer is obliged to reduce it by all possible means: choose more efficient channels, achieve economies of scale, run viral advertising, etc.  Here is a very wide field for creativity. <br>  This indicator and the total number of leads are your personal performance indicators. <br></li><li>  <b>ROI</b> <br>  The most important indicator in marketing is the return on investment.  This indicator shows how valuable you are for the company as a specialist.  For example, you have excellent site traffic, good conversion, high CTR contextual advertising in your niche, cool reports on brand awareness, etc.  All these indicators do not matter to me, until I look at the ROI - if your marketing costs exceed the amount of income from customers who came thanks to you, then I would ask you to correct it. <br></li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/316/265/a52/316265a52a6b4fb59c6f1dd1a6d693d8.jpg" alt="internet marketing figures"><br><br>  It is from the tasks to start the creation of OMiR (marketing and advertising department) in an IT company.  I think they sound close to ‚Äúincrease our sales of software / applications / equipment / services‚Äù (underline).  I would replace with "increase profits."  This and demand from your marketers.  And the magic numbers of ROI, costs / lead and the number of leads will help you with this. <br><br>  PS Order corporate gifts in the first half of October, otherwise you will have to receive them after the New Year. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aed/eb8/93b/aedeb893bcc24ceebcaca883cba32fac.jpg" alt="gifts from internet marketer"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/237845/">https://habr.com/ru/post/237845/</a></p>
