Oh no. <br><br>  The Firefly stars Natan Fillion (“Castle”) and Alan Tudik announced joint work on the comedy series “Con Man” (the name can be decoded as “fraudster”, while the plot comes from the words “convention man”, i.e. a person attending fan congresses).  The plot of the series, the heroes of Nathan and Alan were starred in the cult TV series “Spectrum”, after which the hero Nathan smiled luck, and he became famous, and the hero Alan is content with wanderings at numerous fan congresses.  Alan Tudik acts as the main creator and screenwriter of the series. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a38/2b3/79a/a382b379a50c4cb4844eceb8347233ff.jpg">

      Friends decided to take advantage of crowdfunding and <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/con-man">launched a campaign to raise funds</a> for the series on the site Indiegogo.  Initially, they hoped to raise funds for three episodes, but only for the first day of the campaign more than doubled their requests already, and now they updated the “ladder of achievements” to 12 episodes, i.e.  until the whole season.  Apparently, the target of $ 1.75 million will be easily achieved - now the campaign has already collected more than $ 1.1 million. <br><br>  The promotional video reveals that the partners of Nathan and Alan on the comedy series will be Catherine Felicia Day (“Buffy the Vampire Slayer”, “The Doctor Horrible Music Blog”, “The Supernatural”), Seth Green (“Robotsyp”, voice “Mass Effect” ), Gina Torres (another actress from the main part of “Firefly”) and James Gunn (the creator of the “Guardians of the galaxy”). <br><br>  The creators of the series explain that with the help of crowdfunding they want to escape from the oppression of television networks that close the series for unknown reasons.  In the video, Alan and Nathan say that if the company succeeds, “they will build a spacecraft, where Nathan will be the captain, and Alan will manage it,” which can be regarded as a hint of the revival of the Firefly.  I do not know how anyone, but I already crossed my toes. <br><br>  The series "Firefly" for the authorship of "Joss" Whedon (the creator of such magnificent series as Buffy the Vampire Slayer "," Angel "," Dollhouse ") combined elements of Western and space opera.  He talked about the adventures of the Firefly class crew of the Serenity spacecraft in 2517.  The series became a cult, but for some reason his filming was suddenly stopped by the FOX television channel, and only 11 of the 14 episodes filmed were shown on television.  This led to the emergence of numerous petitions from fans, demanding to continue shooting the series.  Despite this, the shooting was not resumed.  Three years after that, the full-length film “Mission of Serenity” was shot, the plot of which completed the series’s plot. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/377269/">https://habr.com/ru/post/377269/</a></p>
