  <section class="page js-page"><h1>ProfsoUX-2014 - videos and overview</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A couple of weeks ago, in St. Petersburg, the usability conference of <a rel="nofollow" href="http://2014.profsoux.ru/">ProfsoUX-2014 was held</a> , with its “trade union” name denoting precisely the industrialism of the problems heard at the meeting of Leningrad workers in the field of Usability and UX.  As if it’s a joke, although the reality is developing in such a direction that the “trade unions of workers of the person-oriented design of interactive systems for electronic computers of GOSMINERGO” will really appear soon. <br><br>  Everything was positive - here <a rel="nofollow" href="http://ux-spb.ru/itogi-profsoux-14/">is a brief report</a> , hundreds of four people gathered in two halls, plus you could watch the broadcast and ask questions through Twitter. <br><br>  In addition to the broadcast, I recorded the conference, and good-quality video recordings (editing from three cameras and a screen, sound from microphones) were given, giving a full effect of presence.  All reports are vigorous and dynamic (exceptions were <i>energized</i> during installation), with good quality slides - after all, the selection by the Program Committee was strict, with control of materials and obligatory listening of all speakers.

      Here, as an illustrative video, a three-minute overview video of all the reports of the conference. <br><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/90816889&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjz0-yOjT1N6MmOLupCqjNJlB52uA" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" title="Review movie ProfsoUX-2014" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  And now, under the cut, I offer a brief review-classification with links to the video, so that you can see exactly what you are potentially interested in. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><hr><h3>  UX Philosophy </h3><br>  There are reports about the global and strategic: trends, concepts, approaches. <br><br>  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://talks.rosalab.com/index.php%3Ftitle%3D20140426-12">Taras Brizitsky: “Stupid Things”</a> - About the frustrating world of <s>predatory,</s> <s>clever</s> stupid “things of the future”, appearing like without a “creative design”, a pure evolution through mutations, and with a result like “doublefaceplm” and “killmepls”.  On the other hand, UX-designer's thoughts about light bulbs ... let's say, reminded the UX-anecdote “How many UX-designers do you need to screw in a light bulb?  - P @ u, they now also want to screw the light bulb ... ". <br><br>  It is possible that there would be no mediocre dullness and creative ugliness, and all that, it’s necessary that the UX not only had a conveyor process from narrow specialists, but a brilliant engineering genius, who boldly resolved the seemingly insoluble problems of contradictory requirements.  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://talks.rosalab.com/20140426-28">Andrey Kuryan</a> told about the well-known TRIZ - Theory of Inventive Problem Solving, on the example of a simple designer puzzle, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://talks.rosalab.com/20140426-28">in “Caffeine for UX”</a> . <br><br>  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://talks.rosalab.com/20140426-11">Andrew Zusman “Designing Cognitive Engagement for Everyone”</a> “Abroad” traditionally defended minorities and people with disabilities - this time they didn’t care even about color blind people, but about illiterate dyslexics - “how poor they will feel on the Internet we designed”.  Personally, it seems to me that they are not 10%, as the speaker said, but all 90%, and they feel great on these very Internet sites.  The report is English-speaking, but understandable, because, the author, as a whole, is our person: “Israel + Russian wife”. <br><br><hr><h3>  Research </h3><br>  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://talks.rosalab.com/20140426-13">Sofya Chebanova: “A Great History of Games User Research”</a> - A half-hour overview lecture on computer games and the evolution of approaches in their research from a leading specialist in wargaming.  On the one hand, it was academic, and on the other hand, it is not taught at the institutes yet, and knowledge of the history of evolution (interfaces, research methods, programming languages ​​...) is a great way to start to see trends. <br><br>  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://talks.rosalab.com/20140426-26">Ekaterina Shafeeva: “Interface research is obvious things that you can forget about”</a> - how to do a mind-mapping so that “the meter does not affect the object of study and the result”.  The speaker is clearly a professional - a girl in strict glasses, an interest in role-playing games, and obviously not a "cook" - I am not a cook at all, but the cake in the photo can not be "Napoleon". <br><br>  And in continuation of this - the subtleties of the questionnaire studies: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://talks.rosalab.com/20140426-24">Anna Biryukova “K <sub>ux</sub> - we measure Godzilla.</a>  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://talks.rosalab.com/20140426-24">How and why to measure UX in numbers</a> . <a rel="nofollow" href="http://talks.rosalab.com/20140426-24">”</a>  How to derive from the heap of “paper answers” ​​with the magic formula the Right Quality Factor, with which you can already work, compare, etc. <br><br><br>  Aaaah <s>, a shahid in the hall ... The</s> famous Dutch researcher and teacher <i>Suleman Shahid</i> with " <a rel="nofollow" href="http://talks.rosalab.com/Measuring_%25E2%2580%2598the_Must%25E2%2580%2599_%25E2%2580%2594_Going_Beyond_Usability_%2528Suleman_Shahid,_ProfsoUX-2014%2529">Measuring the Must - Going Beyond Usability</a> " first spoke at length about the importance of emotions in the UX, essentially retelling the famous book by Donald Norman, and then did the knight's move, telling that such ephemeral parameters as emotions, can be easily, without experts from the “Theory of Lie”, read on an industrial scale with a special software and webcam.  Well and, accordingly, to use in measurements, especially when another way from the user is difficult to achieve a sane answer (children, the disabled, etc.).  But, although the speaker assured the technology is reliable, and not “rocket-sains”, I personally doubt the theories from the book of Norman and that recognition of facial expressions will be effective on Russian users who reliably hide their emotions under the guise of Grumpy Cat. <br><br>  In any case, this is a well-known specialist and an excellent report - second place for reviews, so, <s>but, no, do not go yet - the video is closed for viewing, because the speaker has burned several slides under the NDA, and now there is a discussion about what to do about it.</s>  <s>But, I think, in a couple of weeks, we will remake and declassify this video, and put</s> everything there, again you can watch. <br><br><hr><h3>  Subject stories </h3><br>  There are specific stories about aspects and practices in real business, from “production workers”, not “trainers”. <br><br>  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://talks.rosalab.com/20140426-21">Alexander Bezborodov: "How do we cope with the substantive and technical complexity"</a> - Two letters - "1C".  For many years, the company has been friends with usabilityists, has been training employees, is being promoted at UX conferences, ... and still receives questions in the spirit of “Are you the main player on UX in 1C?  Wow.  And when will you start? ” <br><br>  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://talks.rosalab.com/20140426-22">Ekaterina Yulina: “How to ask for money through the TV?”</a> - Oh, these little and stupid SmartTVs, from which the business people want to make a video rental machine.  So far, everything is not very much there, and what the problems are exactly - the speaker and the audience told me.  Personally, I hope that the optimal SmartTV will help up to a normal laptop and it will have Popcorn Time, Anidub ... and all that. <br><br>  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://talks.rosalab.com/20140426-17">Margarita Titova: "How we work with web analytics data and what comes out of it</a> . <a rel="nofollow" href="http://talks.rosalab.com/20140426-17">"</a>  A simple case is “online tours”, a simple tool is Google Analytics, and with this, what can be done precisely to improve UX and conversion, which hypotheses arise, and how to test them. <br><br><hr><h3>  Process </h3><br>  There are more likely short-talk reports about where the UX actually lives, what is its place in development, how to build interaction and resolve conflicts with customers and with the team of testers, analysts / designers and developers, project and product managers. <br><br>  Muddy productions orally or in detail prescribed multi-volume unreadable TK?  Waterfall, or throw out assholes and break through the week?  Different projects, different companies, different approaches. <br><br><br>  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://talks.rosalab.com/20140426-18">Sasha Kutsenko: “Why and when to write a specification”</a> is the first step towards the formalization of processes, at least fixing statements and specifications, moving to guidelines and other regulations.  The audience (young and female) wondered incredulously how it was possible, although in essence the speaker described the first and necessary steps to move from chaos to predictability. <br><br><br>  The next step is <a rel="nofollow" href="http://talks.rosalab.com/20140426-15">Lydia Bogdanovich: “Slender processes = effective interface.</a>  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://talks.rosalab.com/20140426-15">How to build workflows in the design department so that everyone loves you ”</a> , already about the separation of roles and responsibilities, so that no one“ plays around with the design ”and another skew occurs, and how to finally build a real UX Conveyor (Love?). <br><br>  The next level of formalization, probably already beyond rationality, is <a rel="nofollow" href="http://talks.rosalab.com/20140426-19">Yevgeny Ovcharenko: “Processes in government contracts”</a> .  Speaker - UX-consultant of the “state portals”, shares insiders.  The audience listens, being interested mainly in “how much money there is,” and whether this game is worth the candle. <br><br><br>  And in contrast to these reports - what to do when it is necessary YESTERDAY and ANY COST - the best estimated conference report - <a rel="nofollow" href="http://talks.rosalab.com/20140426-14">Anton Utkin: “Keeping short, complex and serious cross-media design projects in wartime conditions</a> ” was dragged off on Twitter for quotes.  “Do not work with assholes”, “Remove agencies”, “Remove all unnecessary” ... “All these bastards will not help the cause in any way”, “Stop writing TK” - a short report (&lt;10 min) and, in a military way, clear.  Recommendations leading dog breeders! <br><br>  Well, whatever the process, the problem is muddy customers, although they are either unclear or impossible (“seven red lines” <a rel="nofollow" href="http://alex-aka-jj.livejournal.com/66984.html"></a>  ), and how to remove and identify the requirements in them - about this <a rel="nofollow" href="http://talks.rosalab.com/20140426-27">Sergey Pavelchuk "Require or offer?"</a> . <br><br><hr><h2>  Misc </h2>  Separately pull out a couple of reports. <br><br>  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://talks.rosalab.com/20140426-25">Victor Filippov: “The initiative is punishable”</a> - despite the frightening and demotivating name - about self-motivation.  The fact that "it is ideal only where we are not," and that one should not wait for mercy from nature, because everything - including the meaning of life, can certainly be found even in current work. <br><br>  And although the conference turned out to be more practical - i.e.  scientific and educational kind of like should be left out, here they tried to arrange a <a rel="nofollow" href="http://talks.rosalab.com/20140426-1a">round table "Questions of UX-education"</a> , gathering Russian and foreign <a rel="nofollow" href="http://talks.rosalab.com/20140426-1a">UX-</a> teachers, coaches and students, both academic and business.  There were several mini-reports with slides, and a bunch of suggestions of varying degrees of intelligence, and a discussion with the audience, where the youngest was present for less than a year. <br><br><hr>  So, I hope the dear reader will find something of interest. <br><br>  By the way, these are still beta versions of the video, they have “debug information” embroidered in them - for example, red time markers of the true time.  So if all of a sudden, you find some critical bug in the video (the sound is gone, you need to make the screen bigger in order to read something, or vice versa, remove the screen to see the laser pointer) - write <a rel="nofollow" href="">me</a> , or comment to the video, or BOS, in general, as you please - specifying this very range of time and problem - as long as (a couple of weeks), you can still fix it. <br><br>  Well, if you want more UX-speeches - look <a rel="nofollow" href="http://talks.rosalab.com/%25D0%259A%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F:%25D0%25AE%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8">here</a> - there are almost a hundred UX-reports I shot. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/222415/">https://habr.com/ru/post/222415/</a></p>
