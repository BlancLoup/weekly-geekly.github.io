  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Rambler turned off the TV</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <a href="http://www.ramblermedia.com/">Rambler Media has</a> officially announced a deal to sell its owned TV channel <a href="http://www.rambler-tv.ru/">Rambler-TV</a> .  The amount of the transaction has not yet been disclosed and will be announced only after its completion and receiving the necessary approvals from the Russian authorities.  A well-known holding company <a href="http://www.profmedia.ru/">Prof-Media</a> acted as the buyer of the TV channel through the offshore Osgora Production, whose assets include the newspapers <a href="http://www.kp.ru/">Komsomolskaya Pravda</a> and <a href="http://www.sovsport.ru/">Sovetsky Sport</a> , the cinema chain <a href="http://www.sinemapark.ru/">Cinema Park</a> , <a href="http://www.avtoradio.ru/">Avtoradio</a> , Internet projects <a href="http://www.afisha.ru/">Afisha.Ru</a> and <a href="http://www.e-xecutive.ru/">E-xecutive</a> .  The holding is a member of the largest Russian financial and industrial group <a href="http://www.interros.ru/">Interross</a> . <br><br>  Rambler went on the air in 2002, becoming the first Russian Internet company to decide on such a move.  Rambler-TV has chosen a scientific and educational concept for itself, intending to occupy an appropriate niche on Russian TV.  To date, the potential audience of the channel in Russia is 40 million people.  However, at the age of 6 to 54 years, ‚ÄúRambler‚Äù is watched by only 0.43% of viewers.  The channel‚Äôs financial performance is improving, but its business remains unprofitable: last year Rambler-TV‚Äôs revenue was $ 2.8 million, loss before taxes and depreciation expenses was $ 3.27 million. In the first half of this year, Rambler -TV "amounted to $ 2.15 million and $ 1.4 million, respectively <br><br>  ‚ÄúIn the first half of 2006, Rambler-TV showed a two-fold increase in the revenues of Rambler-TV compared to the same period in 2005,‚Äù said Irina Hoffman, general director of Rambler Media.  ‚ÄúHowever, we believe that the channel will bring greater income to the owner, who has his own air frequency in Moscow.‚Äù  Now Rambler will focus on online projects.  Although the company had high hopes for the TV division: its presence was one of the most attractive factors for investors when the company entered the London Stock Exchange, and Ms. Hoffman herself came to Rambler from the television business (she had previously worked on the TV channel 3).

      ‚ÄúRambler-TV‚Äù broadcasts in open mode via satellite, and the channel's broadcasts are retransmitted by a number of regional TV companies.  In Moscow, where all the TV channels are exclusive, Rambler unsuccessfully tried to get its own frequency.  Now the channel is available only to subscribers of paid television networks and residents of some of the Moscow region cities where Rambler has agreed to relay its signal with local television stations. <br><br>  But last year, the TV channel gained access to the northern capital by <a href="http://www.media-online.ru/index.php3%3Fid%3D12571">purchasing the St. Petersburg network NBN</a> .  Thanks to this deal, we managed to find buyers on Rambler-TV.  As acknowledged by Prof. Media's general director, Rafael Akopov, the holding was interested first and foremost not in the channel itself, but in its St. Petersburg frequency.  Now it will launch the recently acquired Prof-Media Moscow TV channel 2x2, at which the <a href="http://www.press-attache.ru/Article.aspx/news/2910">holding intends to show cartoons</a> .  ‚ÄúThe purchase of Rambler-TV is an important step in the development of 2x2, which will become a TV channel for young and active residents of the two capitals,‚Äù says Mr. Akopov.  What will happen to Rambler-TV was not explained in Prof-Media, saying only that its regional network is a separate asset for the holding.  Since the announcement of the sale of Rambler-TV was made late in the evening, investors had not yet had time to respond to it with any change in the stock price of Rambler Media. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4584/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4584/</a></p>
