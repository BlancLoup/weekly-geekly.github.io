This is not customary to speak out loud, but I want to confess.  I do knee-applied DIY.  Many of you will understand me. <br><br>  And I also love karate, or rather Kyokushin karate.  Once in training, we worked out the reaction time.  The essence of the exercise was that the back touch your shoulder and you have to hit the pear with the smallest time lag. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/539/0d6/9ea/5390d69ea7324a7b8292b34f3fed5e8e.jpg">

      With a more detailed study of the issue, it turned out that strikes on light and sound triggers were practiced in shock sports as early as the 20th century.  I was looking for a ready-made device that could turn any punching bag into a smart one, but did not find it.  And why not try to make such a narrowly specialized fitness tracker of a certain activity for combat sports?  No sooner said than done!  Almost‚Ä¶ <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">I have already told my story of the formation of a knee-applied DIY</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  My name is Vyacheslav Golitsyn, and I am GIK!  It all started at school, and my friends from the physics and mathematics class put me up to it.  At recess, sneaking in the toilet and around the corner of the school, we were discussing new gadgets and circuits for radio transmitter bugs.  I thought I would just indulge, but then I could not get off.  The electronics that I was going to fix, no one had ever seen working in the house, during the next enchanting outburst I had cruelly killed the ‚ÄúElectronics 302‚Äù tape recorder.  I was punished, but I could not completely give up my addiction, so I became a secret geek, but even in the radio club I was not accepted for my own, yes, there is little noticeable in the clubs, because of the pathos everything is upside down.  When I exchanged my new snow scooter for the textbook of A. Marchenko and the designer of the car receiver, I realized that I was rolling on the bottom!  They began to recognize me in the face on the radio markets and in electronics stores, I read ‚ÄúYouth Technique‚Äù and mediocre forums at night on dialup.  I started to wear glasses with simple glasses, because  and so everyone called me "bespectacled."  Even my own father somehow put me 3 in classmates. <br><br>  I finally broke off when a girl left me, then I suffered ... I bought a new soldering station, and my account on Aliexpress began to demand blood - an increasing part of my modest salary. <br></div></div><br><br>  <b>Gadget requirements:</b> <br><ul><li>  Counting the number of strokes </li><li>  Counting the "approximate" impact force based on the displacement and deflection angle. </li><li>  Training mode with the ability to set the intervals from and to between the alarm about the need to strike </li><li>  Verification mode  Formation of the progress chart and the average time lag between the signal and the impact. </li><li>  Send information via Bluetooth to your Android device. </li><li>  The possibility of differentiated light indication of the need to make various blows, for example, with legs or hands. </li></ul><br><br>  <b>I assembled a prototype of what turned out to be in the pantry:</b> <br><ul><li>  Arduino Mega 2560 </li><li>  Gyro MPU-6050 GY-521 </li><li>  Piezo emitter </li><li>  LED matrix </li><li>  Battery </li><li>  Bluetoth module HC-05 </li></ul><br><br>  KickBrick is a sports gadget that allows you to train the speed of reaction and the speed of impact, the gadget is mounted on a punching bag with a belt.  Setting up and receiving information about the success of a workout is done when synchronizing with a mobile phone or tablet via Bluetooth, KickBrick uses light and sound indication to signal the need for a strike.  Sensors in the device record the moment of impact and the time lag since the alarm. <br><br><h3>  Video </h3><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Lz620itmhFA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Search for utility models did not bring results, the closest that I managed to <a href="http://www1.fips.ru/fips_servl/fips_servlet%3FDB%3DRUPM%26DocNumber%3D88276%26TypeFile%3Dhtml">find</a> . <br><br>  According to <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/paullamkin/2016/02/17/wearable-tech-market-to-be-worth-34-billion-by-2020/">Forbes,</a> the wearable electronics market will reach $ 34 billion by 2020, and there will be a share for highly specialized gadgets for certain sports in this market.
