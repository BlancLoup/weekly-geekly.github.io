I was hoping to get to the necropolis in the Kremlin wall, which did not work out for me <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/274661/">last visit</a> in April.  But, alas, no luck again - Red Square was closed for the presentation of certificates.  I watched the childhood adventures of Sharpe‚Äôs shooter, I recently learned and appreciated books and a television series about the adventures of Horatio Hornblower, so Napoleon was quite an interesting option.  In addition, there was a temporary exhibition of weapons and armor of the Renaissance. <br><br>  <b>Admission</b> : 550 rubles for a comprehensive ticket to the permanent exhibition and another exhibition. <br>  <b>Photographing</b> : Free for permanent exposure, 100 p for an additional exhibition. <br>  <b>Overall rating</b> : A great museum for those interested in history. <br><br>  Despite the fact that people of the past were limited in technology, they still found ways to create impressionable things.  For example, a duel set that Napoleon presented to General Berthier. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d25/19b/b8f/d2519bb8fe8c4ff893494b6e9398c23a.jpg"><br><br>  The guns with the funnel at the end of the barrel, now depicted in cartoons in cartoons, have a real prototype - musketons.  A short rifle, often used by cavalry, was loaded with a canister, and the funnel facilitated the reloading process.  In addition, at that time there was an erroneous opinion that such a barrel increases the expansion of the canister. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b19/db7/2ce/b19db72ced384d86bc6fc43549ca0dcd.jpg"><br><br>  A great toy for the 19th century geek is a three-barreled pistol.  For more peaceful minded geeks - sextant and level.  By the way, the sextant was also used in space - when the Gemini-12 refused docking radar, the astronaut Buzz Aldrin managed to get close to the Agen target, using only his and complex mathematics. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/757/033/10d/75703310dd4949aebb1e9fac7e4e3179.jpg"><br><br>  Classic era - smooth-barrel muzzle-loading guns. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d6a/c70/3ab/d6ac703abf574b0489e32b1eb765b868.jpg"><br><br>  Order.  By the way, the Danish Order of the Elephant is still awarded. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e0a/290/8a2/e0a2908a27b74251b41014365ad46dcf.jpg"><br><br>  A fool studies martial arts, a smarter man is tactics, a clever man is a strategy, and a wise man is logistic.  Like any aphorism, this is a simplification, but without logistics, no army can fight.  The field kitchen does not look like a high-tech, if you don‚Äôt know that constructively it was a water bath in which the food could not be burnt.  The kitchen could work on the march, was transported with just one horse and had a lot of other pleasant technical details.  And a hungry soldier goes slowly and fights badly. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/07a/95d/d73/07a95dd731834a47a2bd0b0b0374fcc6.jpg"><br><br>  A well-known artifact is a bullet that injured Lieutenant Khlopov at Borodino.  The second lieutenant survived and was promoted to colonel, but died after an operation to retrieve a bullet in 1840.  The widow put a bullet in a silver frame for memory. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8ea/9ff/0af/8ea9ff0af9e04422be05b0d059675a61.jpg"><br><br>  Travel set.

What motivated these people who decayed five hundred years ago?  Just by order of the gentleman or the need to feed himself and the family, the artist will not give all the best.  Ambition  Ambition, the desire to do a mega-cool thing, so that all who see it, gasp.  While such people are among us, I am optimistic about the future of mankind.  Realizing their ambitions, people achieve personal success, while inevitably moving humanity forward, and shine a beacon for those who want to stand on their shoulders and realize their ambitions. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/c8GLo0aQ3LU%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500004,15700002,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhg0PtPOH24nyhjhrCGuW9qmkFcomw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h4>  Museum of railway equipment at the Riga station </h4><br><br>  At the Riga station is a monument to the first satellite.  Someone bent the satellite antennas for some reason, the angle from which it looks more or less decently had to be chosen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/85e/cd7/7cd/85ecd77cd8354e58b4c58f87ca2033da.jpg"><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">The railway equipment museum at the Riga station has no direct relation to space, therefore, under the spoiler</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  <b>Admission</b> : 100 rubles. <br>  <b>Photographing</b> : 200 rubles. <br>  <b>General assessment</b> : A great choice for those interested in equipment and railways. <br><br>  The museum has an open-air exhibition, where in four rows are locomotives, diesel locomotives, electric locomotives, various cars, and an indoor exposition, which was closed on the day of my visit.  The beginning of the exhibition, steam engine OV, the legendary "sheep". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e55/c30/e99/e55c30e99f604011a4d2c1882bed1aec.jpg"><br><br>  Stylish in front of a steam locomotive FD is a smoke chute so that smoke does not obscure the driver's cab.  What is curious, this decision was ambiguous, considering that the smoke screen worsens the view, and the steam-engine building plants alternated the production of steam locomotives with and without smoke screens. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b36/f63/11a/b36f6311a4c144ff983d3a906847d492.jpg"><br><br>  Some exhibits can be climbed.

It is a pity that this is no longer done. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c6c/80d/5f2/c6c80d5f25fc483b9e54997f64282dd1.jpg"><br><br>  A strange technical solution - the windows in the car, from which you can only look at the other car.  By the way, this is an elite class saloon car with six axles and a bath. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6f6/74b/5cb/6f674b5cb9a0456b95b6a5c9ef513876.jpg"><br><br>  Smooth lines change in angles.

Therefore, if in April I advised to visit this museum, now I advise you to go there every quarter or every visit to Moscow.  It will be interesting. <br><br>  Compared with April, the Space Age Pioneers Hall has been updated. <br><br>  Stand dedicated to the designer Viktor Ivanovich Kuznetsov (gyroscopic devices).

Batteries degraded less than expected. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bc2/a24/d97/bc2a24d972174c2b979f7e227dfacb31.jpg"><br><br>  Navigational beacon and batteries. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/60c/7f1/6ea/60c7f16ea2524a37b6aff95b2329eece.jpg"><br><br>  Rolled solar battery.
