Having fluently reviewed that I haven‚Äôt had it anywhere I decided to look in online stores - I found only ‚Äúinitial bleed‚Äù coolers from 12.5 dollars and having estimated that despite the fact that there is an Intel Pentium 4 CPU 2.66 GHz and an ASRock 775i65PE motherboard I‚Äôm not going to deal with the overclocking on this system, I‚Äôll understand that there‚Äôs absolutely no need for such overclocking, and I don‚Äôt really need much cooling, although this configuration will be fine as a file server or second home  his PC, for example. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img src="http://hostpic.ru/?di=WLPO" alt="image">

      After all these reflections, I decided to more thoroughly rummage around the PC accessories and suddenly remembered that there is somewhere a boxed cooler from Intel CPU i7-2600K 3.4GHz, which is not used because of the purchase and installation of CoolerMaster V10 immediately to allow for a relatively cruel overclock unlocked processor.  From memory, the attachments are the same, and the compatibility of 1155 and 1156 inspired hope.  Visually on the photo, the sockets are also identical. <br><br><img src="http://hostpic.ru/?di=QPW6" alt="image"><br><br>  Having rejoiced at the discovery, I began to try on a cooler to the motherboard and a discrepancy between the holes and a spread of about 5 mm was found.  That is, the 775th has a smaller hole distance from the center of the socket compared to 1155. <br>  I did a web search for a compatibility issue and found an installation option for a cooler from the 775th for the 1155 processor, written by the way on our website ().  Judging by this research, backward compatibility is absent in principle. <br>  However, deciding not to lose hope and eventually go on an experiment for the sake of pure interest, he used a little brute force for the initial cramming into the nests of the base attachment legs.  It immediately became clear that it should not stand like that and the skew was present.  Having shoved all four legs (you shouldn't be afraid that it will break - with due effort without busting or using screwdrivers, everything goes in quite well, despite perpendicular unevenness), the main task remained - setting the latches to the fixing position, which required pressing on them and passing the core through the center of the latches in the holes of the motherboard.  This is precisely what caused the fear of possible damage to either the cooler itself, or the very same - the motherboard itself. <br>  Armed with caution, I decided to try it all the same: a very tight pressure and the subsequent dubious but clear clicks marked the fixing of the cooler in the socket.  Visually, the fit of the cooler is correct, the heads of the clips obviously stand in collapse.  Well, nothing - the main thing to work! <br><br><img src="http://hostpic.ru/?di=E9FP" alt="image"><br><br>  As a test of the correct installation of the cooler, I decided to test for warming up the processor: the system was used on an open bench, measuring the temperature according to the readings of the motherboard itself after 32 hours of operation showed 32 degrees.  This testifies to the excellent fit of the cooler, and even among avid pisimistov can not cause distrust in such a setup. <br><br><img src="http://hostpic.ru/?di=FSR9" alt="image"><br><br>  Well, so briefly, I announced my struggle with fears and fears.  I hope that those who wish to make such iron assemblies will give my post confidence both in their abilities and in the correct actions.  Good luck! <br><br><img src="http://hostpic.ru/?di=YF3F" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://hostpic.ru/?di=R4D4" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/167949/">https://habr.com/ru/post/167949/</a></p>
