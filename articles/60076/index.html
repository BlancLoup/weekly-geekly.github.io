  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The book "Secrets of Google Web Applications"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello.  My name is Denis Baluyev and I am writing a book about Google‚Äôs web applications.  Sounds like a confession from anonymous alcoholics club member, right?  I like it too.  About how the book is created, I will tell you on this blog with your permission.  You give a literary reality show about how a book is created from scratch - from the first chapters of a draft to getting delicious smelling of ink on printed copies of authors and reviews of first readers! <br><br>  I am a non-professional writer.  From the second class I dreamed of becoming a programmer and ten years later I became one after all.  Developed and implemented enterprise management systems (ERP) and customer relations (CRM).  Then he was engaged in the optimization of production processes, and therefore I know firsthand what Kaizen is and, pardon me, muda.  In addition, I occasionally wrote articles on technical topics in various magazines - most of them were printed by Computerra magazine, dearly loved by me since school.  I also accidentally won a competition for the best fantastic story in the magazine "If."  Since then, ‚ÄúYandex‚Äù is full of <a href="">links to the audio version of my story ‚ÄúLatecomers‚Äù</a> .  Some even know me as the author of the blog <a href="http://lifehack.ru/">LifeHack.ru</a> - one of the first in RuNet on the subject of ‚Äúlife hacking‚Äù. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Why did I decide to write a book about Google?  Perhaps one of the advantages that I definitely have (in general there are few of them, and modesty is clearly not one of them) is the ability to explain rather complicated things in a simple and understandable language.  The emergence of this skill is obvious: the fact is that I myself ... not very intelligent :) And if I could explain something to myself, I can explain it to anyone!  Amazingly, this skill only works for things that I like - apparently there is some kind of psychological trick to this.  I use Google services almost from the moment of their creation - they are made as it is convenient for me, powerful, modern and really beautiful.  I like them, understand?  At the same time, not a single good book in Russian about Google services exists in any way.  In any case, neither Ozone, Yandex, nor the seller of a bookstore near my house know about them.  And I would like to talk about Google services so that they become understandable and convenient for people who are not very well aware of what web services are.  I would like to write a book, after reading which, my mother would have got herself an account in Gmail.  It would be very convenient to communicate with her through Gmail Chat.

      I have not written a single book before (except for the science fiction novel that I started in the first year of the institute and almost finished writing to the end, but hopelessly stuck in the end. Yes, perhaps we will not take it into account), I don‚Äôt know the subtleties communication with publishers, I don‚Äôt know how to promote a book to the market, and, probably, I don‚Äôt have any idea about a million different ‚Äúfine points‚Äù appearing on the way of writing a book and publishing it.  The more interesting it will be to readers of the blog dedicated to these things!  The advice of future readers of the book will also be useful to me - let's discuss together what should appear in it, as well as what should not be there!  In the <a href="http://gappsbook.ru/">GAppsBook.ru</a> blog <a href="http://gappsbook.ru/">,</a> I will post excerpts of chapters, news related to the world of Google, training videos.  By the way, my first video on survey forms in Google Docs: <br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/tXBoHWz8CQ0%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhhsUUkqQ9tz5EdgcScEwRLlR4JNJg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  As always, the author is open to suggestions and suggestions.  Write in the commentary or to the address baluev@gmail.com - I will try to answer very quickly and clearly.  In the meantime, you can read the <a href="http://gappsbook.ru/%3Fp%3D15">content of the</a> future book and a <a href="http://gappsbook.ru/%3Fp%3D18">small preface to it</a> .  At the moment, four chapters out of ten have been written, in total 4 copyright sheets (160 thousand characters).  I plan to finish the book in mid-August. <br><br>  Wish me good luck. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/60076/">https://habr.com/ru/post/60076/</a></p>
