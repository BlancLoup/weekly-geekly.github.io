  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What happens with google?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Yesterday, March 24, 2008, around 12:30 Moscow time, my google-box met me not with new letters, but with a concise message about a temporary error 502 and advice to try to enter in a few minutes.  Several minutes stretched out to several tens of minutes, and then several hours, but the box showed no signs of life.  Simultaneously my GTalk also died - it willingly connected, but the roster was empty, and the attempt to write to someone caused an error. <a name="habracut"></a>  Gugldokami everything was in order. <br>  I‚Äôm tied to the mailbox a lot, like many, probably (the main thing is working correspondence), and Google‚Äôs Jabber‚Äôs even more =) So it‚Äôs not surprising that this state of affairs not only did not suit me, but also caused a slight panic .  A study of Internet sources was undertaken, which at that time did not reveal much excitement in the Runet. <br>  But on Google's Discussion Boards, everything was not so smooth - the forum was full of 502 numbers in the headers.  As it turned out, quite a significant part of Google users encountered an error 502 and did not have access to their boxes for several hours.  It also affected users of Goggle apps using Google services on their domains.  This relationship didn‚Äôt have a relationship with the provider and the user‚Äôs network ‚Äî often one of the two employees sitting nearby had an ill-fated mistake, and the other with the mail was all right.  Attempts to log in to another computer, clean the cache, reboot and dance with a tambourine did not lead to success.  There was also no specific territorial binding of the problem, although I saw a lot of Russian nicknames on the forum.  A couple of my internet friends also ran into this problem. <br>  On the <a href="https://mail.google.com/support/bin/request.py%3Fcontact_type%3Dgtag_server%26ctx%3Dgtag_server">page for accessing</a> the support, you could see only a few tips to try to search for a solution to the problem in other sources, apparently, the reception of letters was limited due to overloading the service.  But in the evening I accidentally managed to get on this page a form of contacting the support directly, which I immediately took advantage of =) To Google‚Äôs honor, I even received an answer to the specified contact e-mail, and at about 11 pm I was able to log in and connect in gtalk. <br>  In the evening of March 24, Google‚Äôs support published a <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/gmail-help-alerts/browse_frm/thread/10300c331443dfc8">Gmail alert</a> about this error, which contained a log of engineers ‚Äôactions.  On the night of March 25, engineers reported that they had dealt with the problem, but complaints from users <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/Gmail-Help-issues-logging-in/topics">continue to flow</a> . <br><br>  I publish this report, because  did not find sufficient coverage of the problem in Runet.  Faced with a similar situation - try to write through the support contact form, but keep in mind that it is not always issued there.  You can also report your problems <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/Gmail-Help-issues-logging-in/topics">on the</a> Google <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/Gmail-Help-issues-logging-in/topics">discussion board</a> , but this, judging by experience, is less effective than referring directly. <br><br>  The story is not over yet. <br>  Many people do not see me online in Google Jabber, although it is possible to communicate at the same time. <br>  Google translators do not work - they give out the same phrase that you feed them (upd - now they give out server error in general).
