  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How Heisenbug works</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p>  Heisenbug 2018 Moscow recently passed.  Not only testers gathered under one roof, but also programmers, specialists in automatic and load testing, team managers and all the others for whom testing is the most important part of life.  This post is a photo report, in which we will once again look at how it was (carefully, traffic).  Photos in really good quality will arrive a little later, and this is what we took on ourselves along the way.  At the end there will be a couple of words about the next Heisenbug 2019 Piter and how to submit your report to it. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-g/3s/wi/-g3swilluti6trl0fsniprhnlaa.jpeg"></p><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1 id="podgotovka-i-matchast">  Preparation and materiel </h1><br><p>  Hi, I am Oleg, I was lucky to help a little in organizing Heisenbug, and I also had a camera.  There will be a few pieces that participants usually do not see, absorbed by the next report. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mr/10/6u/mr106ujufgg8qsb_dygyxfpzk3k.jpeg"></p><br><p>  So, about nine in the morning.  The first participants have not yet arrived, and Baruh Sadogursky has already ‚Äúbanished‚Äù his keyout before the program committee - for the last time before the actual performance.  To be in time, speaks at double speed.  Even for him it is not easy, in one breath you need to say a lot of words. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/px/yo/-g/pxyo-g4pqyzt9slt9ycl882bpac.png"></p><br><p>  Subsequently, a girl appeared at the site, who outlined the reports in this original way: </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hg/5d/uc/hg5duc7nlja-w5macr3_dhyzmsc.png"></p><br><p>  Actually, this is the report of Baruch.  The first Facebook comment about this picture: ‚ÄúIs this a report on‚Äú grocery mindset ‚Äù?‚Äù :-) </p><br><blockquote>  <strong>UPD</strong> : found the author‚Äôs twitter picture: <a href="https://twitter.com/ManukhinaDarya">@ManukhinaDarya</a> .  I strongly recommend to subscribe! </blockquote><p>  At the same time, an online broadcasting studio opens, and Vsevolod Brekelov and I discuss the opening interview: </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pt/ze/ih/ptzeiheqvgjswwkajy3atuwpwqc.jpeg"></p><br><p>  The interview is conducted by Zhenya Trifonov and I, each time inviting speakers, program committee members and key community members to the studio.  Subsequently, what is recorded in this studio will not only get on YouTube, but also on the screens between presentations. </p><br><p>  All equipment of the online broadcast is hidden in special cubes filled with everything necessary, from a mixing console to the capture of four microphones: </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/re/o5/dr/reo5druqfg_86-m-n3-rxokhumy.png"></p><br><p>  At the beginning, at the studio door, there was just a sign with the name, but along the way, valuable advice began to appear on the door to people running into it: </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gu/dg/3m/gudg3mprucp45d-lwogmppjbyps.png"></p><br><p>  Nearby is the room in which the broadcast operators are sitting.  This is at least three people - Maxim <a href="https://habr.com/users/m1skam/" class="user_link">m1skam</a> Zverev, Alexander <a href="https://habr.com/users/alsion/" class="user_link">alsion</a> Ivanov and Artem Nikonov.  On the TV, on the left, you can see the image from the cameras of all the halls, on the right - along the graph you can see traffic flowing to the Internet. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8u/j_/s6/8uj_s6fybikpvrfjj9ch2ffokdw.jpeg"></p><br><p>  Look at the most important devices that support life during multi-day conferences: energy, coffee and cola.  Now on the table is a whole battery of redbully. </p><br><p>  Max and Artyom are still doing a lot of things on the court, and Alexander reigns supreme with such a MIDI remote control: </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nw/4d/ha/nw4dhamz5mhwjjbr9uacmhsm6ws.png"></p><br><p>  The remote control allows you to quickly burn through those buttons that control the mouse is extremely inconvenient. </p><br><p>  All arriving speakers need to be photographed in good quality.  To do this, there is a dedicated photographer who, on the <a href="https://market.yandex.ru/product--zerkalnyi-fotoapparat-canon-eos-5d-mark-iv-body/14202707">EOS 5D Mark IV,</a> photographs everyone who stands on this line on the floor: </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/t9/gz/zp/t9gzzpylxexblhqeuxqmp897riw.png"></p><br><p>  If you see glamorous pictures of speakers on the network, then these are just those who have undergone heavy post-processing. </p><br><p>  If you are a speaker and don‚Äôt know how to find a photographer, you will be helped by nyadzhnye unicorns on her feet: </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cb/_r/wa/cb_rwaxmxkk3og4ymdy0xnccwpu.png"></p><br><p>  Our large racks with equipment are deployed in the halls: </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/t9/mr/cx/t9mrcxkhhycrgh4jwhjz8__wcl4.jpeg"></p><br><p>  On the right in this photo you can see the signs that show the speakers for 20, 15, 10, 5 minutes before the end of time. </p><br><p>  Similar iron stood on aftepati, but with an additional remote control.  On the left of the photo - our main in terms of hardware, Bogdan Zaitsev, we owe him a lot of normal work and the existence of all these clever self-made racks and consoles: </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/am/fg/di/amfgdibzd2s7zymqmf67r-mhat4.png"></p><br><p>  Speakers are here for such departments: </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ju/ja/-p/juja-pn978dobejachx51evypoq.png"></p><br><p>  But this is not a simple notebook stand, because something interesting is hidden inside: </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/iy/ma/fv/iymafv4z5rcq0amc0paofwoijba.png"></p><br><p>  At the speaker, however, they are looking directly at the eyes with super bright lamps and a super bright projector.  They really blind the eyes.  This is a sacrifice that the speakers and organizers have to bring for the participants to see everything well, and after the conference you will receive videotapes with a high-quality, clear and juicy picture (but only if you fill in the feedback form!) </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/uw/sj/tu/uwsjtuwqm64fqpdrwtuotclwxve.png"></p><br><p>  Zhenya Trifonov and I do not use anything other than hand-held microphones and buttonholes.  The rest of the equipment is stored in special cases, and communication takes place over walkie-talkies. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/da/v1/wa/dav1waxvy82a5rpmjk2oxqsmu_4.png"></p><br><p>  The speakers are not available on the radio, but they read the Telegram and are often in the speaker‚Äôs room, where they spend time between performances, prepare for their reports and simply communicate.  The speaker room is a standard meeting place. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/f5/hz/te/f5hzteu3-avh-ajnesvwzhscdpw.png"></p><br><p>  In addition, you can navigate through several halls where the reports are held.  All of them are called famous names on gold plates with a special color "Slavic": </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ts/bs/9o/tsbs9oaqusdbx6ullc-uvsa8ndq.png"></p><br><p>  Whistling everyone in Pushkin, the first day begins! </p><br><h1 id="den-pervyy">  The first day </h1><br><p>  First of all, participants are met at the registration desk.  For speakers there is an extra small stand. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/9u/1x/yz/9u1xyzjdy7djp4vkbyh6vhgro18.png"></p><br><p>  The most valuable thing in registration is handing over the duck! </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/3o/qi/f5/3oqif5lqgxevag8oqqvvpzybwz0.jpeg"></p><br><p>  This is followed by the opening ritual, including a speech by the directors of the JUG.ru Group and sponsors. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8m/vn/qh/8mvnqhkynuvyzehwmbtv2e5jqvq.png"></p><br><h1 id="otkryvayuschiy-keynout">  Opening keyout </h1><br><p> <a href="https://heisenbug-moscow.ru/2018/msk/talks/6pqi4xyovicyiaeyuoousi/">Keynout</a> leads <a href="https://heisenbug-moscow.ru/2018/msk/talks/6pqi4xyovicyiaeyuoousi/">Baruh</a> Sadogursky.  ‚ÄúLet's dismiss all testers‚Äù is a provocative topic, and who would have thought - Baruch could very clearly and rationally explain the topic so that at the end it was necessary to seriously try not to agree with the conclusions. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bb/ox/n2/bboxn2ys0t3xlycmotriar-_b7e.jpeg"></p><br><p>  I brought a large pack <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Liquid-Software-Achieve-Trusted-Continuous/dp/1981855726">of my own authorship books</a> with me and distributed them to everyone for free.  The books went like hot cakes.  Wishing to get an autograph found Nemer.  For example, we are lying on binbegs next to the Badoo stand, and Baruch continues to sign, even in a lying state. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/2u/d6/iy/2ud6iy4phsgnua4boyovc541tic.jpeg"></p><br><p>  By the way, a completely different kind of books were sold nearby in the demo zone.  It is absolutely impossible to resist the desire to take a picture with your favorite C ++: </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/4m/xi/1k/4mxi1khr46vy4l1c3oqunrcvmzu.jpeg"></p><br><p>  Further reports are in normal mode.  In each slot there are three reports, three speakers, three discussion zones.  Heisenbag loves a trinity. </p><br><p>  Below are links to all the description of the reports, and the photos correspond to the list from left to right.  Links can be used to quickly look at the slides of the relevant report.  Videos will be sent to the participants after filling out the feedback form. </p><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://heisenbug-moscow.ru/2018/msk/talks/2dbie0buyoyk0eso2meaou">Need to do a project refactoring?</a>  <a href="https://heisenbug-moscow.ru/2018/msk/talks/2dbie0buyoyk0eso2meaou">Have an IDEA!</a>  - Artem Eroshenko </li><li>  <a href="https://heisenbug-moscow.ru/2018/msk/talks/5fjrzpxgkaqcygmyog2moo">How we wrote the Sealant framework for searching for memory leaks in JS</a> - Sergey Dokuchaev </li><li>  <a href="https://heisenbug-moscow.ru/2018/msk/talks/4izuup5qqcgyuaw0qimgiq">Let's go write your Selenoid Mesos framework!</a>  - Anna Chernysheva, Alisa Kokoreva </li></ul><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/o5/th/ml/o5thmlrnbdvjp2x7achvyj3kauo.png"></p><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://heisenbug-moscow.ru/2018/msk/talks/3ys0j5doimiasciioo20ea">It's just too slow:</a> Doug Sillars </li><li>  <a href="https://heisenbug-moscow.ru/2018/msk/talks/2dp0ymjeiuseqm6kq22gsa">Java project and Reactor</a> - what about tests?  - Kirill Merkushev </li><li>  <a href="https://heisenbug-moscow.ru/2018/msk/talks/3xgx4o7l6gcyke24eoakye">Features of visual interface testing</a> - Anton Usmansky </li></ul><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ue/yu/sz/ueyuszqsrxdw5fdhbigpgfybxjm.png"></p><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://heisenbug-moscow.ru/2018/msk/talks/3epihofb0s2s6wwgccucau">Zelochki in Selenium WebDriver</a> - Alexey Barantsev </li><li>  <a href="https://heisenbug-moscow.ru/2018/msk/talks/4ygxznohe8gmi4aocikg6s">How to build ‚ÄúAutomation Test as a Service‚Äù for large-scale e-commerce website in eBay</a> - Bingsheng Ru </li><li>  <a href="https://heisenbug-moscow.ru/2018/msk/talks/6rhc8zkbfueay2eai4gg4u">Selenoid Cluster Management with Terraform</a> - Leonid Rudenko </li></ul><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mw/ax/sf/mwaxsf1263ywq4r77tfstyvwoys.png"></p><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://heisenbug-moscow.ru/2018/msk/talks/1cncaz3lz2csgwk4wuyqk">One thousand and one UI-bug, or How to teach the developer to avoid typical errors in the UI</a> - Ekaterina Mikheeva </li><li>  <a href="https://heisenbug-moscow.ru/2018/msk/talks/2ago8baqiki26qycsy2koo">Flying start into contract testing</a> - Piotr Kubowicz </li><li>  <a href="https://heisenbug-moscow.ru/2018/msk/talks/5wqyxfycocssa02gcky0ce">Recipes for creating from scratch and development of a load testing system</a> - Anatoly Plaskovsky </li></ul><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/im/d8/r0/imd8r0l1ons1ljqalqqe3wli-_i.png"></p><br><h1 id="zakryvayuschiy-keynout-pervogo-dnya">  First day closing keyout </h1><br><p>  The day was completed by a report by YouTube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Wylsacom">Wylsacom</a> , known for critical reviews of technology and especially for apple devices. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/t5/rx/5c/t5rx5cgkmedj8okehyy0xmgwjne.jpeg"></p><br><p>  According to <a href="https://socialblade.com/youtube/top/country/ru/mostsubscribed">Socialblade</a> , he is now the ninth largest blogger on YouTube. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8s/zy/ob/8szyoblkrfekitui2bl8o-xql0e.png"></p><br><p>  The report was mixed.  Valentine told everything in his usual half-room style - just like he does on his own channel.  Those who watched his videos at least once understood what to expect.  But some were clearly unprepared.  Someone started collecting flash mobs in a chat to play him while he was on stage. </p><br><p>  Despite all this, so many people leaned into the discussion area that they almost crushed against the wall.  To take this picture, I had to defend an impressive line of people who wanted to make selfies. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-n/0b/ma/-n0bmak_xq_tflrvys7kxl4hwwm.jpeg"></p><br><p>  Well, another self-defense campaign on human rights, which waited for Wils for an hour and remained until the very end of the discussion area and conference day in general: </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/6q/wa/kb/6qwakbkhgou7ibj8we2uma2kg-q.png"></p><br><p>  In this picture there is a notable share of irony - the conquerors of YouTube and Habra came together, with an incomprehensible outcome.  In general, the discussion area was very different from comments on YouTube and was reduced to two conversations for half an hour long: what problems have gadgets and what trends are on YouTube now.  Vilsa shared his plans for the development of the channel there, but I don‚Äôt feel right to post it here - it looks like the infa was semi-private, and he told it only on the influx of feelings. </p><br><h1 id="diskussionnye-zony">  Discussion areas </h1><br><p>  Of course, after each report there were discussion zones.  This is the most famous feature of the conference, so I won't talk about it for a long time, here are a couple of random photos: </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jx/uu/y6/jxuuy6odqa0gr74qu6gjvtrxclo.jpeg"></p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/j2/pc/xc/j2pcxcduduh9nicswjq4ol_vq9w.jpeg"></p><br><h1 id="sponsorskie-aktivnosti-demo-stage-i-mnogoe-drugoe">  Sponsorship, Demo Stage and more. </h1><br><p>  This time the conference had a lot of sponsors, and they did a terrible job to make fun between presentations.  But if you list them all, then this habrapost will never end!  Therefore, for reasons of honesty, I will not publish any photos on this topic, those who wish can watch them in our <a href="https://vk.com/heisenbugconf">group on VKontakte</a> . </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/il/nt/hb/ilnthbwfcxowji5_xhfli_ahzzo.jpeg"></p><br><p>  I'll tell you better about the Demo Stage.  On it, during the report, the most filled hall was broadcast, plus various mini-activities sometimes took place during the breaks.  On the one hand, its main task is a purely utilitarian solution to the problem of temporary overcrowding in the halls.  On the other hand, it turned out to be a place of attraction and a convenient meeting place for the participants.  Unfortunately, for the same reason I have almost no photos from this zone: I tried to walk there in stealth mode, so as not to prevent people from listening to the report. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/i9/9r/ll/i99rllcw7emfluvaoqtwufyi3eo.jpeg"></p><br><p>  In general, photographing at such a concentration of people in such a way that it does not bother anyone is very difficult. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ar/su/hi/arsuhiwe2ci_dqycdtot5dkotmg.jpeg"></p><br><h1 id="birds-of-a-feather-flock-together">  Birds of a feather flock together! </h1><br><p>  Immediately after the end of the main program of the first day, two parallel BOF sessions were waiting for us: </p><br><ul><li>  ‚ÄúDo we need the role of a tester or all migrate to the SDET, development, etc.  " (in Russian) </li><li>  ¬´Career in testing: develop skills in one tech stack vs.  many different stacks (Java, Python, C #, C ++, etc.) ‚Äù(in English) </li></ul><br><p>  BOF is now a traditional format at our conferences.  Something like a round table or discussion group in which everyone can take part.  This format historically goes back to the first informal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birds_of_a_feather_(computing)">discussion groups of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)</a> . </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0c/lb/1n/0clb1n5gpbujlseflss0y9lpfli.png"></p><br><p>  Some problem, it seemed to me, was the overcrowding of the first BOF session.  Previously, this format had a rather limited number of discussion lovers - I remind you that there was a party at the same time where you could do the same thing, but in a more fun format with music and beer.  But this time turned out to be special - there were as many people in the room as there are in not every report.  All this seriously complicated the situation for those who came late, for them the BOF was just another report.  Most likely, this situation will try to fix the following Heisenbug. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/5b/p_/so/5bp_so8sogbysy5xg_7lftzeobc.png"></p><br><p>  But at the English-speaking session of the people there were exactly as many as needed.  Even a little bit small. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ep/ng/n6/epngn6v9rkgou5y-mfqqwjli1fo.jpeg"></p><br><h1 id="vecherinka">  A party </h1><br><p>  As an alternative to bofam, there was a party with drinks, snacks, and music.  Party fire! </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1f/qi/m_/1fqim_7kxlmywke_0w_7iketj_o.jpeg"></p><br><h1 id="ignite-karaoke-battle">  Ignite Karaoke Battle </h1><br><p>  In the afternoon, in the middle of the hall, there appeared such a sign: </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fl/bo/ld/flboldbo_0dsabxucummixttjmw.jpeg"></p><br><p>  By evening, it was already filled. </p><br><p>  The rules are simple: two participants take the stage, and they have to tell something on the basis of slides, which they, of course, have never seen before.  And the slides are selected that you need, believe me!  Participants tried to build a coherent story, telling one after another.  Who can not cope - flew out of the tournament.  And so - until the winner. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vw/sr/kr/vwsrkrnpqdusw8tq1uj0gbuy-tg.jpeg"></p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/33/jg/tj/33jgtjdjpqnt77sh3h-sfuagkew.jpeg"></p><br><p>  Even Zhenya Trifonov ( <a href="https://habr.com/users/phillennium/" class="user_link">phillennium</a> ) decided to <a href="https://habr.com/users/phillennium/" class="user_link">take part</a> .  I was even a little afraid that he would win (he is known for the frightening ability to rap at x2.5, that is, he has a dishonest advantage over ordinary people).

With his own eyes, he saw how he perfected the slide selection algorithm while sitting in the speaker‚Äôs room.  Everything is written there in a very simple JavaScript, everything is completely transparent and fair, but I will not tell the implementation details :) </p><br><p>  In general, it turned out very fun and cool, waiting for the next time. </p><br><h1 id="den-vtoroy">  Second day </h1><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://heisenbug-moscow.ru/2018/msk/talks/2u7tvlnin60cgy68usmigq">Kotlin Tooling QA</a> - testing tools around a programming language - Liliya Abdulina </li><li>  <a href="https://heisenbug-moscow.ru/2018/msk/talks/4gjiduaauwiiayoaygmki6">Elegant integration testing of a microservice zoo using TestContainers and JUnit 5 using the example of a global SMS platform</a> - Andrey Markelov </li><li>  <a href="https://heisenbug-moscow.ru/2018/msk/talks/2bvwczxr7auqyo26yk6asm">Rediscover exploratory testing</a> - Ingo Philipp </li></ul><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/9s/ba/3h/9sba3hja47gskv2lnjx_7wjfh5m.png"></p><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://heisenbug-moscow.ru/2018/msk/talks/3bzyot4tgacm4oqquyckmo">Voyeurism tester, or How monitoring by users will help you</a> - Antonina Khisametdinova </li><li>  <a href="https://heisenbug-moscow.ru/2018/msk/talks/3vjkn0micguu6sqgu2kkyu">Finding security issues in open source</a> - Alexander Todorov </li><li>  <a href="https://heisenbug-moscow.ru/2018/msk/talks/6awjbm80nyeosmk6yse6ag">Testing systems with external dependencies: problems, solutions, Mountebank</a> - Andrey Glazkov </li></ul><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dp/k8/kk/dpk8kk4aflm83_-4ec_udhbp-xw.png"></p><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://heisenbug-moscow.ru/2018/msk/talks/1yioqtzumegeusoguec4ki">Find 10 differences, or How and why test the layout</a> - Lyudmila Mzhachikh </li><li>  <a href="https://heisenbug-moscow.ru/2018/msk/talks/5oxrmkpfzu0oiqi6wmkcak">Public blockchains: What could possibly go wrong?</a>  - Rhian Lewis </li><li>  <a href="https://heisenbug-moscow.ru/2018/msk/talks/6brpu4ituiaw2eksmucaom">Profiled, profiled, yes not ... or Why profile end-to-end mobile application tests</a> - Vyacheslav Frolov </li></ul><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/u6/he/sr/u6hesrjed-npsgicn2motc8emoi.png"></p><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://heisenbug-moscow.ru/2018/msk/talks/2tkgfd1pfkusyasuu4iyi6">Testing and crying with Spring Boot Test</a> - Kirill Tolkachev </li><li>  <a href="https://heisenbug-moscow.ru/2018/msk/talks/2l8hdnhhzs0sgkc8q4k4k4">Unit tests - from theory to practice</a> - Vadim Pushtaev </li><li>  <a href="https://heisenbug-moscow.ru/2018/msk/talks/63rnjwahyamm882mqwmecs">Candy Crush Saga</a> - Alexander Andelkovic </li></ul><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/oj/wz/z6/ojwzz6ilh981wlzy_ujjqobudso.png"></p><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://heisenbug-moscow.ru/2018/msk/talks/6alqyqqgfuiuccwoeamwco">What can static analyzers do?

All you need to know is Vitaly Friedman, one of our most beloved and popular speakers, who made bright and memorable presentations. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fa/o8/j6/fao8j6pk-czrfnbbyriswzgs20u.jpeg"></p><br><h1>  Next Heisenbug and Call for Papers </h1><br><p>  This post would be incomplete without the announcement of the <a href="https://heisenbug-piter.ru/">next <b>Heisenbug</b></a> .  It will be held <b>May 17-18, 2019 in St. Petersburg</b> . </p><br><p>  And, of course, you can submit your own report.  This is real.  Remember the feedback form, which is filled after the conference?  In response to the question ‚Äúwho should I call for a report next time?‚Äù Many participants answer ‚Äúme‚Äù. </p><br><p>  Program committees read completely all applications and carefully consider them.  Yes, there are many famous personalities in the list of speakers, but it is quite possible to get there.  It is necessary, of course, to work well on the content and on the feed, but you will be helped by people who are well versed in this. </p><br><p>  There are very specific criteria for the adoption of the report, which can simply be met.  There is a specific process that begins with the acceptance of an application and ends with a speech at a conference. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xt/gz/3m/xtgz3myzznwg6kfbx0pmgnmfc6u.png"></p><br><p>  To start your journey as a speaker, you need to <a href="https://heisenbug-piter.ru/callforpapers/">follow the link</a> , read everything there carefully and do as it is written. </p><br><h1>  Early bird </h1><br><p>  If you go to <a href="https://heisenbug-piter.ru/">the Heisenbug 2019 Piter website</a> or to our groups in social networks, you will see that everything is just beginning.  The program committee has not yet laid out even the first version of the program, we are still collecting feedback from the participants of the Moscow conference, photos in the process of processing, and so on.  The team is now starting its six-month journey to the perfect Heisenbag. </p><br><p>  Right now, at the very start of the conference, you can buy tickets at the best price.  This is an option for people and companies who are willing to invest in creating the best testing conference in Russia and are confident that we can do it.  Is there any reason for such confidence - judge for yourself on the just-past Moscow Heisenbug. </p><br><p>  Another point: at the last two of our conferences (DotNext and HolyJS) all tickets were bought out in two weeks and it‚Äôs not a fact that this will not happen again.  All have long been accustomed to, that this happens at music concerts, and plan them in advance.  It is also possible to get a Heisenbug ticket strategically.  If you agree - open the <a href="https://heisenbug-piter.ru/registration/">appropriate page of the</a> site (until <b>January 1,</b> the cheapest tickets are available). </p><br><p>  In any case, thank you for being with us and for reading this post to the end. </p><br><h1>  See you at Heisenbug 2019 Piter! </h1><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/eh/mw/la/ehmwla7971stq2dbgxsw6gyrvx8.jpeg"></p></div>
