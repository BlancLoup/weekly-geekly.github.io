  <section class="page js-page"><h1>VeeRoute is the winner of the it track</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Companies of all sizes involved in shipping and delivery often face various logistical challenges.  Sometimes it is quite difficult to calculate the optimal route, while saving time and, accordingly, money.  This problem is particularly relevant for large companies that need to calculate hundreds of routes per day. <br><br>  VeeRoute came to the rescue.  This company is developing special algorithms that allow you to build routes in real time.  The product is intended for online stores, retailers, distributors, courier services and service companies.  It can be used by companies that have up to 10 cars, and those who have a car fleet. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The program allows automatic scheduling with sending the route to the driver‚Äôs smartphone.  VeeRoute saves 60 hours on planning and up to 50 thousand rubles a month on gasoline and salaries. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"

      <br>
      So, the product has the following advantages: <br>  ‚Ä¢ Automatic scheduling <br>  ‚Ä¢ Manual route adjustment <br>  ‚Ä¢ Android application for drivers <br>  ‚Ä¢ Plan-fact analysis in real time <br>  ‚Ä¢ SMS notification of planned arrival time and delays. <br><br>  The creators of VeeRoute, Vladislav and Mikhail Kudinov, describe their project as follows: ‚ÄúOur algorithms allow us to build routes, practically, in real time.  Planning for 10,000 addresses takes 10 minutes.  We cooperate with leading suppliers of geo-information services (PTV, Telogis, Yandex, etc.), which provide current maps and traffic data.  The service is designed in such a way that the flexibility and availability of the REST API allows us to take into account the specifics of the company and integrate into existing business processes. ‚Äù <br>  It is worth noting that the company employs leading experts: students and graduates of ITMO University, world champions in algorithmic programming, Russian developers who have vast experience in promoting similar products in the US market. <br><br>  Vladislav Kudinov answered our questions: <br><br>  <b>- Vladislav, how have you and your team changed thanks to the acceleration program?</b> <br><br>  <i>By the beginning of acceleration, we only finalized the product and realized that we are ready to enter the market.</i>  <i>Therefore, in fact, we can say that we have grown an infinite number of times: from 0 to 7 clients, from 0 to 365 thousand rubles.</i>  <i>payments per month.</i> <br><br>  <b>- The idea / quote / advice / comment of one of the mentors who really helped, sunk into the soul?</b> <br><br>  <i>To be honest, Alexander Borodich made the greatest contribution to our victory, when after the semifinal he said at dinner: ‚ÄúAnd someone has a VERY good project, but he VERY terribly presents,‚Äù and then he added: ‚Äúare you anyway?</i>  <i>so present?</i>  <i>and you teach others as well ‚Äù(at the expense of others you teach - I just took up the project, 2011-2013 was the head of the business incubator of the ITMO University).</i>  <i>This, in general, was the case, because after the semifinal, I took only 7th place and, thank God, that it was not 5 projects that went to the IT track final, as in the other tracks, but 9.</i>  <i>After that, I, together with the team for 3 days, almost without sleep, completely reworked the presentation.</i>  <i>Well, you know the result.</i> <br><br>  <b>- What is the originality of your solution for the Russian, international market?</b> <br><br>  <i>For us, this question has probably become the most frequent lately, since</i>  <i>we are solving a problem that many of us already know from the university bench - the task of a traveling salesman.</i>  <i>Our uniqueness is in the algorithms.</i>  <i>We spent a year and a half solving the problem of how to make the algorithms take into account a huge number of factors, including traffic jams, and at the same time worked at the click of a finger.</i>  <i>We succeeded only because we have a unique fusion of young geniuses, represented by world champions in algorithmic programming and people who for 15‚Äì20 years have been creating and implementing transport systems to leading companies in Russia, Europe and the USA.</i> <br><br>  <b>- How old are you, and how did you get the idea to try to create your own business, when most of their peers do not bother with this?</b> <br><br>  <i>I'm already 29 years old.</i>  <i>In general, this is not my first startup, I started my first friends in 2006, and from 2011 to 2014, I, as director of the business incubator, ITMO already actively promoted the benefits of my own project to young people, when everything depends on you and You immediately see the return on investment.</i>  <i>As for VeeRoute, we have many projects in the incubator that are faced with the fact that there are very bad courier services in Russia, which are constantly late and disrupting orders, and I will not even mention Russia mail.</i>  <i>So, I began to study the causes more deeply, and I realized that no small role in this is played by the fact that no one knows how to build good routes and manage their couriers.</i>  <i>In general, we solve this problem.</i> <br><br>  <b>- How far in the future do you look: think only about current problems, set goals for 3-5 years?</b> <br><br>  <i>My brothers and I were always ambitious people, when we did the incubator, we planned to create the best incubator in Eastern Europe and we succeeded in part.</i>  <i>Now also the situation - we want to create a great technology company that will cost at least a billion dollars, and we know how to do it in 5 years, so we have already launched several new directions in parallel, which we will release to the market in the near future.</i>  <i>Some say, but how to focus on one direction - but it is easier for us, because there are three of us.</i> <br><br>  The VeeRoute project on October 9, 2014, won the special nomination of the Skolkovo Foundation within the framework of the Web ReadyGeneration S final. The team received a special prize - 100 thousand rubles.  And on October 16, 2014, VeeRoute became the winner of the IT track of the GenerationS contest! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/241505/">https://habr.com/ru/post/241505/</a></p>
