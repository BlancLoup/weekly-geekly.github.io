      <b><i>In general, now it is in the past, gentlemen.</i></b>  I present to you a wonderful thing: <a href="http://www.adata.com.tw/en/product_show.php%3FProductNo%3DATRAZZZWH"><b>A-DATA Reader Series microSD Trio</b></a> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  This is a great idea to make an SD card that can be read on any computer without a card reader.  A-DATA embodied it.  This is a microSD adapter to SD format with a built-in USB-connector.  In the picture you can see everything - on the side of this miniature card reader a microSD card is inserted, and from below (on the opposite side from the SD connectors) a removable cap under which the USB connector is detected. <br><br>  Of course, the USB connector is a bit thinner than the SD itself and does not have a casing like the full-fledged connectors, so it doesn‚Äôt hold well in all USB connectors, and also doesn‚Äôt end up on some recessed sockets, which makes it a little crooked , lifting up spring contacts in the computer, due to which there may be not very good contact. <br><br>  The cover of the USB connector sits quite tightly;  fear that the microSD will fall inside the card reader is also not necessary.  In general, I am extremely pleased with this purchase.  The main advantage for me is that I can store a USB flash drive directly in a laptop, and at the same time write to it. <br><br>  I tested the card reader with the included microSD card (4GB) for the read and write speed of the program HD_Speed ‚Äã‚Äã1.5.3.64 from SteelBytes on my EeePC 1000. The results are as follows: <br>  When working as an <b>SD card</b> : <b>read</b> speed <b>17Mb \ s</b> , <b>write</b> speed <b>15Mb \ s</b> <br>  When working as a <b>USB flash drive</b> : read speed <b>17Mb \ s</b> , write speed <b>12Mb \ s</b> <br><br>  <b>The kit includes:</b> <br>  - card reader itself <br>  - the cap for the USB-connector (worn, climbs into the SD connector with the cap on and does not stick out) <br>  - microSD card <br><br>  Also inside is a LED that lights up blue when working via USB.  When working as an SD, it was not possible to see if it was on.  I can say that since the LED is hidden under a thin white plastic, it almost does not cut the eyes. <br><br>  <b>Not advertising:</b> <br>  I bought myself such a little thing with a 4GB card in a set at NeoTorg at the River Station for <b>1290 rubles</b> .  Also there were found the same kits with a 1GB card for 330 (it seems) rubles.  There were no kits with an 8GB card. <br><br>  Also, there were simply found SD-cards with a USB-interface (not card readers) for 4 GB of A-Data ("A-Data SD Duo").  Unfortunately, did not notice - <a href="http://www.adata.com.tw/en/product_show.php%3FProductNo%3DASDUZZZBK">Speedy</a> or <a href="http://www.adata.com.tw/en/product_show.php%3FProductNo%3DASU2CL6BK">Turbo</a> .  The capacity is also 4GB, 8GB was not. <br><br>  <b>PS&gt;</b> In my EeePC 1000 as a USB, it ‚Äúsat‚Äù well only in the left slot.  Perhaps the quality of the assembly, and perhaps - the right ones loosened.  He also installed the driver when connected via USB (he found not a removable disk, but a card reader), and asked for a reboot.  However, without it, everything worked well. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/48362/">https://habr.com/ru/post/48362/</a></p>
