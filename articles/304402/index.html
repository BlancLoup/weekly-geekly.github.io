Now you have the last step to successfully enroll and receive scholarships - writing motivational and three recommendation letters.  However, these 4 letters are decisive and essential for decision making by the selection committee.  Because, the previous stages are just the minimum requirements, so to say the elimination of candidates. <br><br>  <b>Motivation letter</b> (hereinafter referred to as MP) 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

      <br>
      In a cover or motivation letter, you must <b>‚Äúsell‚Äù yourself</b> . <br><br>  In this context, the word ‚Äúsell‚Äù has no bad meaning, but it is meant to demonstrate / present / show oneself from the best side. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In MP there are several aspects that should be listed: <br><br>  1. <b>Introduce yourself as an individual.</b>  The reader should feel intimacy with you, find out what you like about your type of activity and hobby.  I have once said that they sponsor students who will potentially contribute to the name of the university, namely to culture, to the educational process, etc.  Therefore, if you are a professional pianist, athlete, masterfully play the balalaika, this will also be a plus in your favor.  I am sure even the fact that I am from Kazakhstan helped in my case - having studied the statistics of international students, it seems that I am the very first Kazakh and a citizen of the Republic of Kazakhstan at Baylor University.  And they are interested in what new students from the CIS, for example, can bring to their society. <br><br>  2. <b>Your motivation and reason.</b>  The standard question is the same as in the job interview ‚ÄúWhy are you a worthy candidate?‚Äù. <br><br>  <i>I apologize in advance to the person about whom I will tell.</i> <br><br>  I once heard that one guy told in his MP about his hard school life.  (Attention! Not to be confused with pity. The story of a strong will, not difficulties)!  The young man who loved physics lived in the village, and in the villages of the KZ the level of education is weak.  Therefore, it was necessary for him to study physics at least in the district center, which is located 60 km from his village.  Since every day getting there costs money, he started a mini-business - collecting eggs and selling, a mini chicken factory, so to speak, very, very mini.  That was just enough for him to travel daily on the bus at both ends.  So he began to study physics physically in an olympiad school in the district center, and his efforts led him to top places in the Republican Olympiad in Physics, moreover, he shone on the world stage! <br><br>  Well kaaaak?  How can such a story not like the selection committee?  No way!  Even Nike's motivational videos fade with his real story.  As a result, full funding in the MIT undergraduate university itself. <br><br>  I remember the film ‚ÄúTwenty-one‚Äù, where at the end of the film for an interview at Harvard Medical School, the hero of the film, after telling his story, asked: <br><br>  - Did I dazzle you?  (Have I blinded you?) <br><br>  So, your task is to try to blind the reader with your story and / or motivation. <br><br>  <b>3. Your achievements.</b>  Since, you will send your resume, where you list your achievements, in the MP list, the achievement may be an extra tautology.  But I think all the same it is worthwhile to finish my mini-stories with the result you have achieved.  The main thing is not to overdo it, and maintain balance.  For example, I talked about founding with friends of my IT startup.  He told about the ups and downs that we faced from the second year, and the result we achieved.  Two hares were shot down here: he showed his individual qualities and teamwork, which is an important criterion for university teachers.  After all, in order to do research, you need to be able to work in a team, and even conduct it <br>  <b>4. The nature of the essay and hope for the future.</b>  Do not be afraid to show your optimism and vision of your future.  What is normal in our society is pessimistic for Americans.  And the fact that we are optimistic, they are in the order of things.  In any interview, they consider the candidate as if he exaggerates his qualities.  Therefore, talk about yourself a bit more than it actually is, perhaps, how would you like to see yourself. <br><br>  If the main part of your essay is appropriate, then in conclusion tell me that you have an intention to pursue science and continue your studies and research as a PhD. <br><br>  <b>5. Volume of essay.</b>  If the university does not specify the boundaries of the number of words in the MP, write on 2-3 pages. <br><br>  It seems the main points of writing the MP I listed.  Let's go further <br><br>  <b>Recommendation</b> (hereinafter RP) <br><br>  As a rule, universities and programs require 3 RPs (reference or recommendation letter).  As well as in MP, you are a product that you need to sell, and the recommender is already selling it.  It is worth noting that your friend may even be a referee. <br><br>  How well the referee knows you is more important than his position and status.  However, let's not forget about status <br><br>  Let it be better if the assistant professor, with whom you did research on your diploma, than the dean of a PhD with over 100,500 awards, with whom you work a little as a rule. <br><br>  It is also important to know that it is desirable that each RP shows your <b>individual good qualities</b> .  For example, in my case, the first RP described me as a startup, the second - a programmer, and the third - a teacher.  However, it is not necessary to "burn", even in each RP there will be standard general values ‚Äã‚Äãthat you are supposedly an outstanding student with good academic skills and so on.  As well as in MP, in RP your qualities should be exaggerated a bit. <br><br>  The volume of the RP is already smaller - with a header and a signature one page, the text is somewhere <b>in half A4</b> . <br><br>  <b>Interview</b> <br><br>  I almost forgot to tell you about skype-interviews.  Usually, after selecting candidates for a program, universities may ask you to have a short skype interview.  If you received a letter about the interviews, rejoice - this is a good sign that you will get your way.  As a rule, the interview is the very last stage, at which a small percentage of the candidates who have already passed can be eliminated.  An intro usually takes from 10 to 30 minutes.  However, you need to properly prepare for it!  Repeat theoretical materials, climb through different forums and get ready for sample standard questions.  I'm sure if you received a notice of the interview - you are lucky! <br><br>  So, I hope I was able to deliver the main requirements and points about admission to the free magistracy in the USA.  I sincerely hope that the topic will help readers to enter the magistracy and already return home with good specialists in their field. <br><br>  Well, as I receive additional thoughts about the master's program and not only, I will share with you! <br><br>  <i>To be continued...</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/304402/">https://habr.com/ru/post/304402/</a></p>
