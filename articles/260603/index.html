  <section class="page js-page"><h1>VeeamON Forum 2015 Moscow. Results</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On June 2, the VeeamON Forum was held in Moscow - the first event in Russia dedicated to technologies ensuring data availability.  We gathered the leading virtualization industry vendors, invited you to Ritz Carlton Moscow and spent the day discussing advanced technologies that help implement the concept of Always On-Business. <br><br>  Under the cut, we share our impressions, materials from the forum and announce the name of the lucky person who said the code word ‚ÄúHello, Habr!‚Äù When registering, and won the Xbox. <br><br><h4>  "Energy rushing!" </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c6a/821/5bb/c6a8215bbc3748c09bc49b04c14e1058.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The number of participants in the VeeamON Forum exceeded all our expectations.  We counted on 350-370 people, but by noon there were 550 registrations!  Such a cluster of like-minded people created a special atmosphere for the event: the hall was buzzing like a beehive, and everyone had a place in it.  People communicated, gathered at live screens, listened to engineers at the demo stands, or worked with labs.

      The audience came so prepared that we were pleasantly surprised.  No wonder they organized a separate Q &amp; A zone, where system engineers answered the guests' questions.  According to one of the engineers, he answered questions from ten in the morning until four in the evening - six hours without a break!  Even though the forum is over, we are happy to continue the discussion of data availability in virtual environments - visit us on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/VeeamRussia" title="Veeam on Facebook">Facebook</a> , join <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/veeam-software" title="Veeam on LinkedIn">LinkedIn</a> , ask on <a href="https://twitter.com/Veeam_RU" title="Veeam on Twitter">Twitter</a> or leave comments on the Veeam posts on Habr√©. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/971/8ea/2a9/9718ea2a9ec74f5ebd87664466a3ba0c.jpg"><br><br>  VeeamON Forum was led by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mkozloff" title="Mikhail Kozlov on LinkedIn">Mikhail Kozlov</a> , director of business development for the ActiveCloud group of companies and business consultant, a well-known person in the domestic IT business.  Mikhail personally knows all the speakers, which added ‚Äúsalt and pepper‚Äù to his interviews with speakers: he did not hesitate to ask provocative questions to his interlocutors.  I recommend listening to at least some of the conversations in the <a href="http://go.veeam.com/veeamon-forum-moscow" title="VeeamON Forum Moscow">recording</a> - it will be curious. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/924/f6e/902/924f6e902267493cab841abca0640f86.jpg"><br><br>  Predictably, an interview with the president of Veeam Software, Ratmir Timashev, collected the largest "rating" among the viewers.  The hall is filled with people to failure, the number of connections to the broadcast has reached a peak - everyone wanted to hear firsthand the history and development plans of an IT company, which in just 8 years gained millions of turns and entered the number of ‚Äúvisionary companies‚Äù (Visionaries) according to Gartner .  If you are also wondering whether Veeam will go to IPO, what place the company occupies in the global market and how the business has changed in Russia, according to Ratmir Timashev, watch the <a href="https://vimeo.com/130048359" title="Interview with Ratmir Timashev at VeeamON Forum Moscow">interview in the record</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/959/cb7/fa1/959cb7fa19b44aa0bfc5f51c9446314b.jpg"><br><br>  The VeeamON Forum has already become international and has been held in Dubai, Paris, London and Frankfurt.  However, the Moscow forum was a special event for Ratmir Timashev.  According to Ratmir, he enjoyed the event immensely.  He was pleased to see in his homeland a high interest in modern technologies of virtualization and data availability, which are supported and developed by Veeam. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8ab/536/278/8ab53627850843c397187be817d6bc82.jpg"><br><br>  Theory and common words are good, but practical experience is always more interesting.  Representatives of RaiffeisenBank, MTS and Uniastrum Bank told about how they implemented the Veeam solutions and what tasks were solved in their infrastructures.  Real examples aroused such a keen interest among the audience that the discussion went beyond all temporary regulations and continued in the lobby.  It is better to learn from the mistakes of others, and to learn from a successful experience is invaluable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9d8/478/942/9d8478942cd24a9290fa73629392f164.jpg"><br><br><h4>  We recorded everything for you! </h4><br>  All the forum materials we carefully collected and laid out on the shelves.
