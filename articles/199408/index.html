From these non-systematic sales, I had a dollar balance in PayPal.  Most often, it was empty, since the conclusion for Russian users was impossible (I mean the conclusion without any tricks) and everything that was formed on this balance was spent on some trifle on the same Ebay. <br><br>  The principle <i>‚ÄúTo buy something unnecessary, you must first sell something unnecessary‚Äù</i> worked with a bang for many years, until under the influence of numerous posts on Habr√© devoted to opening a virtual account in the US through the Payoneer payment system, the card of the same name was not opened.

      It was not possible to take advantage of this excellent opportunity, because in the middle of this summer, a wonderful, as it seemed, news came that PayPal is coming to Russia and the Russian user will be able to access the bank account. <br><br>  And now, the coveted day has come - September 16.  From that day, the payment system upgraded PayPal‚Äôs Russian users ‚Äôoffices. <br><br>  The first slight disappointment visited while contemplating the page of the site of the payment system devoted to linking a bank account: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fc3/c09/922/fc3c09922d7e4968bc1c3879bc51f1b5.png" alt="image"><br>  As you can see in the screenshot, the form for filling contains the BIC field, which means that it is unlikely that any Payoneer virtual account can be linked now.  Also, after a chaotic reading of the new rules, it was found that the tied account should be a ruble. <br><br>  So, inconvenience number 1: <br>  <b>Transfer of funds from the balance can only be made to a ruble account in a Russian bank.</b> <br><br>  By the way, interesting comments from someone at the time of the introduction of changes has already been linked to a Payoneer virtual account ( <s>I think that she drowned</s> ). <br><br>  The inconvenience of number 2 was discovered when trying to transfer a small dollar amount to <a href="http://mymaster.livejournal.com/">Anton Buslov</a> - in response, PayPal showed the following warning: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f34/0c3/696/f340c3696afb01801948f81a3c5c048c.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Payments between Russian PayPal users can only be made in rubles.</b> <br><br>  This is understandable, for good reason the Central Bank of Russia has issued a license to the payment system. <br><br>  But this is a very inconvenient innovation, and you know why?  Yes, ‚Äúopen the balance in rubles and spend your 7 dollars on them, and after transferring it to any user inside the Russian Federation,‚Äù you answer quite reasonably with a question.  But it was not there ... and here we come to the inconvenience of number 3: <br><br>  <b>The conversion of funds between the balances of the same PayPal account is closed and will no longer be available for use.</b> <br><br>  I didn‚Äôt believe it either, got into Help and rightfully discovered the instructions for action there, which always worked fine: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5bb/6ac/521/5bb6ac5219971b6e5b69c7c2bc5de311.png" alt="image"><br><br>  After a slight confusion, I turned to support, hoping to get an answer that this is a temporary technical problem and it will soon be corrected, but the answer convinced me of the senselessness of my optimism: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/21a/c69/f17/21ac69f17cbb17baaada9030be1c5360.png" alt="image"><br><br>  This means that I cannot generate a ruble amount on the balance only if another user does not send it to me: from my card.  To say that it is inconvenient and illogical - to say nothing. <br><br>  This is just the tip of the iceberg, which suddenly turned over in September for PayPal users with its back side.  Surely, more experienced users of the payment system found other ‚Äúsurprises‚Äù, but I noted the most obvious in this note and maybe (the probability of this tends to zero) the payment system will back up and return at least partially familiar and convenient functions. <br><br>  In the meantime, it can be summarized that ease of use has fallen dramatically since the September innovations. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/199408/">https://habr.com/ru/post/199408/</a></p>
