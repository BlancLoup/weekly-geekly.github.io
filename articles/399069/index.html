Not scary.  Black Friday may have ended, but there is still no opportunity to save on it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c2c/98b/671/c2c98b67168806f5fa69f0344cc91e01.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>- Well, why did you take it?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- So the discount was ...</i> <br><br>  The return policy in the US is such that many people take everything on sale without thinking about the need.  After a couple of days, many end up with a bunch of completely unnecessary, or even unsuitable things, bought just to have it - or to grab the last copy. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  US Return Policy </h2><br>  In Russian realities, this is money thrown to the wind.  But the majority of foreign online stores offer a program for the return of goods up to 30 days (some American online stores - and up to 90 days).

      Gave and did not like?  You can return the product to the store, and get the money.  Bought too much?  Can I return.  Does not fit the size or color?  Urgently to the store! <br><br>  Sellers are required to return money to the buyer within the specified period.  Of course, it can be shorter than 30 days - but all dates are indicated directly on the official website.  And unless otherwise indicated, the default for returning the electronics is enough ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt fit / dislike‚Äù. <br><br><h2>  What do they return? </h2><br>  Because of this, after the Black Friday in the United States begins a stir.  Sometimes the queues for the return of goods exceed the queue for the purchase.  But the basic rule of the great American law of commerce: the customer is always right. <br><br>  The largest returns, according to tradition, will fall on consumer electronics and children's products.  TV sets, washing machines and refrigerators go to the shops in the hundreds.  Smaller items, such as game consoles or components, are returned no less willingly.  In this category, the return reaches 30-40 percent of the amount purchased on the day of the sale. <br><br>  The flagship portable technology is often peredarivatsya, or resold to other regions.  But many return it.  There is evidence that a brand new iPhone 5 smartphone dared to return to the store every 300th American (Apple, by the way, did not confirm this information). <br><br>  Other smartphones are returning less willingly.  But laptops (especially the first) come back very actively.  Apparently, the point is quite wide customization possibilities in the USA - if 3-5 modifications of popular MacBook or Dell XPS 13 models are available in Russia, then a choice of a couple of dozen options is available for residents of the United States. <br><br><h2>  Openbox - what is it? </h2><br>  How can you save on this?  Great, fast and very serious.  In American trade, there is the concept of openbox-goods.  This is the name of electronics, the packaging of which has been opened.  As a rule, she returns to the point of sale with the wording ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt like it‚Äù. <br><br>  In the USA, they try not to buy such equipment.  Back in the early 1990s, psychologists found that even a 50% discount is not an argument for purchasing such goods - consumers are ‚Äúused‚Äù, ‚Äúpotentially unreliable‚Äù, ‚Äúdefective‚Äù and even ‚Äúdangerous to use‚Äù. <br><br>  In fact, almost 90% of openbox products are opened by the first owners solely for the sake of curiosity.  Tearing the protective tape, people know that they will still return the electronics box to the store. <br><br>  This applies to most casual purchases or "unwanted gifts."  Someone wants to see the color, others - the form, and others - just hold it before returning to the store. <br><br>  As a result, the biggest trade experts advise buying openbox products after Black Friday or Christmas (New Year).  This is the only period in the year when electronics can be bought below the purchase price.  Even a supermarket does not earn a cent on a special offer. <br><br>  Moreover, discounts work like this: suppose the laptop initially cost $ 1,000, as part of the promotion, it lost 300 in price - and was sold for $ 700.  But in order to sell the returned copy, the store needs to reduce the cost of the product relative to the selling price - so an excellent computer loses another 40-50% in price.  Total, its cost will be only $ 350 - less than half of the initial price.  If you do not disdain open boxes - you can lay out walls with smartphones. <br><br><h2>  How to save money by buying openbox products? </h2><br>  If you did not manage to purchase the desired goods during Black Friday, you should wait a week or two.  New lots with the brand ‚Äúopenbox‚Äù or ‚Äúused‚Äù and a notice about the period of use will be on sale.  All such devices will be covered by a standard manufacturer‚Äôs warranty or a similar offer from the seller (but we are planning to purchase on a large site like Amazon). <br><br>  Thus, it will be possible to save 20-40% of the purchase. <br><br>  <b>Deliver parcels by mail:</b> <br><br>  In one package of USPS we can bring a gadget with a battery + an additional battery.  Or up to 5 batteries by sea (details in private messages and on the website).  Or up to 5 Raspberry Pi Zero in one shipment. <br><br> <a href="http://pochtoy.com/%3Flang%3Drus%26utm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dgeeks16"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/91a/388/404/91a3884042444f849c2fec2aa3d4cbce.png"></a> <br><br>  By tradition - a discount of $ 5 on the first order of delivery of <a href="http://pochtoy.com/%3Flang%3Drus%26utm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dgeeks16">Pochtoy</a> from the USA for all who read up to this place on the <b>supergeek</b> promotion code. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/399069/">https://habr.com/ru/post/399069/</a></p>
