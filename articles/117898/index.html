No seriously. <br><br>  When was the last time you purposefully and consciously tuned exactly to the quality of FM that suits you completely?  Do you remember with difficulty?  Not surprising. <br><br>  It's simple.  We are so accustomed to modern ways of communicating with content, whether it be a blog post on Habrahabr, an audio or video clip, that the notorious disc jockey can no longer surprise us, tune out to our surroundings, enter our social group.  He will never be able to.

      How about radio stations on the Internet?  It seems that the soil is much more fruitful here.  I didn‚Äôt like one thing - I switched on another, ‚Äúloved‚Äù the third, liked the fourth ... And still, he still lacks something.  Which of my friends are listening to the same wave?  Express your wish to DJ?  We still often cannot get what we want.  All because most of the resources that provide such an opportunity, namely, to listen to a good radio on the Internet, does not use a small share of open opportunities. <br><br>  For this reason, <a href="http://frodio.com/">Frodio</a> was <a href="http://frodio.com/">born</a> - a social platform for interactive broadcasting and, of course, radio listening, on the web. <br><br>  How do we do it?  All in order. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In fact, the Frodio design concept begins where traditional broadcasting ends.  He lacks the very interactivity and sociality that listeners want from him. <br><br>  Let's not bend our fingers like a fan, telling us that everything looks like in a dream.  There is something to work on, and with each release Frodio is getting better, getting closer to people. <br><br>  Listeners and Broadcasters (whether you are a radio host, DJ or station owner) are met in one place, with a full range of social functions. <br><br>  The basis of everything: Frodio Social Radio System, abbreviated as SRS, which integrates existing radio stations.  In the near future, we will also provide the opportunity to create our own station with us - specifically for this, we built Frodio on the basis of the cloud infrastructure of Selektel in order to give you complete freedom of action. <br><br>  We offer listeners <a href="http://frodio.com/stations/">42 best streams</a> in real time, each of which will be appreciated by a habrauser.  All of them are selected by community members, and in the future we will give everyone the opportunity to independently select and evaluate the best radio stations. <br><br>  Everyone decides for himself which stations to evaluate so that friends on the network find out about it.  Frodio is integrated with such music services as: Last.fm and Musicbrainz, not to mention the most popular social networks: Facebook, Twitter, VK.  In the end, we can search for information about the performers on Wikipedia - who is not picky? <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/475e1e4f/41762021/706ea856/31695959.png" align="right"><br><br>  But besides the listeners, we also appreciate those who create the radio.  Presenters, DJs of all stripes, and podcasting fans - this is for you! <br><br>  What have we achieved in the last couple of months?  Judge for yourself: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/6793e73f/f238a793/79b60607/0e220091.png"><br><h4>  Serpent Tempter </h4><br>  But enough about what is happening behind closed doors of the TochkaK company and on Frodio servers, it's time to introduce you to our face - <a href="http://frd.io/app">Frodio's iOS app</a> . <br><br>  Immediately, I‚Äôll note that everyone who has great Android-based smartphones shouldn‚Äôt get upset - soon our application will appear for their gadgets, very soon. <br><br>  Do not take away your iPad or iPhone - far, you will definitely need it when you want to install our application.  The reason is simple: it is better not to find it :) <br><br>  This is the front-end of all technologies and ideas embodied in Frodio, which we are proud of. <br>  The application has existed for two months and for all this time more than 6,000 listeners managed to download it.  Most of them live in Russia, but foreign audiences from the USA and European and Asian countries are also interested in good radio. <br><br>  We made this application especially for people who want to simply tune in to the desired wave and have fun - you will not find there all these complicated, unnecessary pieces that some programs abound in.  Not for robots, for listeners. <br><br>  Let's look into each other's eyes: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/27d97519/478ed6b4/d90aab23/3e71ceeb.jpg"><br>  Scroll through radio stations in Cover Flow <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/d2a8db92/f32d73ef/858376bf/65d1b020.jpg"><br>  Pictures of artists are catching up with Last.fm <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/dd4d240c/fcc279fa/ecfd7f15/7ffe691b.jpg"><br>  Sending tracks to social networks <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/61740c80/51c09c5b/b5957046/2350b144.jpg"><br>  Sync favorites with the orbital station Frodio.com <br><br>  Application statistics: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/833c1ab0/fbb3af24/872493f5/bbc906a0.png"><br>  As you can see, in almost two months our application managed to download 6,000 people - we believe that this is a good result. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/a1d3b595/83ac1bb7/33b58123/d3a3740e.png"><br>  As already mentioned, a large part of the audience is Russian, so it can be said with confidence that we are the most listening nation :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/51f0df4f/ef3e1498/f6188a74/cdfbc5c7.png"><br>  We are highly appreciated, and this is an additional motivation for our team. <br><br>  Listen good! <br>  <a href="http://twitter.com/">Frodio team</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/117898/">https://habr.com/ru/post/117898/</a></p>
