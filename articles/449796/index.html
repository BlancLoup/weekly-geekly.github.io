    <h4>  Retreat </h4><br>  As you remember (and if you don‚Äôt remember, please re-read the article <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/437298/">‚ÄúAbout one guy‚Äù</a> to understand the context), this guy claimed that he understood something in business and its processes.  He helped to increase profits there, reduce costs, achieve business goals, and argued that not only could they do it, but programmers, and not just anyone, should. <br><br>  So, among his achievements and practices was such crap as the acceleration of the work of programmers.  The guy argued that the acceleration is quite achievable 10 times.  At the enterprise mentioned in the previous article, he achieved acceleration 4 times.  Where he worked after, reached the number 10. <br><br>  But he, in the context of this topic, always had two problems.  First - he could not prove that acceleration is real.  Well, think for yourself - would you believe that it is possible to make programmers accomplish as much in 3 days of work as they do now in a month?  Okay, let's divide his fantasies by at least 5 - how can you say that in 2 weeks you can make as much as you do in a month?  Crap, right? <br><br>  So he could not prove.  The companies in which he used this practice were not IT-based, and there was nothing to compare with anyone and nothing.  Well, programmers made 100 applications per month, and they began to make 400. Who cares about this?  And after all, there are a lot of arguments in favor of the fact that all this is from the evil one, just juggling numbers, dividing tasks into smaller ones and nothing more than trying to splash eyes to get more money or political points. <br><br>  The second problem is that if the enterprise is not IT, then it is not possible to convert acceleration into money.  Express in money, he tried, but it turned out, again, forks on the water.  For example, through the cost of maintenance, cost of accounting, etc. <br><br>  When he worked at the plant, he even managed to cut personnel costs, but he could not tie up the acceleration of the work of programmers to the WEF.  The head and the owner were adequate people, and they saw that there was something in it, but they were not completely permeated by his ideas.  Even when he applied them not on programmers, but on designers, for example, he accelerated their work several times over one week, thanks to which they closed the project that lasted for years. <br><br>  That's how he suffered with these problems.  He applied his methods in his work, and he whole-heartedly worried that he could not in any way bring this experience beyond the limits of his practice. <br>  And then a girl appeared. <br><br><h4>  Girl </h4><br>  The girl, with a high probability, will read this article, so I immediately ask her for forgiveness.  The guy called her only by name, and spoke of her very flattering and respectful.  She, as they say, and clever, and beauty - the picture showed, I confirm. <br><br>  At the time of acquaintance with the guy this girl worked as the head of the escort department in a fairly large franche 1C.  I must say that the acquaintance was purely business, and so it remained. <br><br>  I know that you stay away from the world of 1C, so I will briefly explain.  The maintenance department consists of several programmers solving small client tasks.  Not projects, not large sales of software or licenses, but small tasks, within a few hours.  Krupnyak in franchah engaged in other departments. <br><br>  Financial mathematics is also very simple.  There is an hourly rate - say, 2,000 rubles.  The client wants to do some nonsense for himself, they coordinate some task with him, and discuss the clock - for example, four.  The programmer makes, hands over to the customer, he pays 8 tr.  It's simple. <br><br>  So, this girl lived for herself, she worked and did not know grief.  And then, by chance, I stumbled upon texts written by our hero somewhere - just about speeding up the development.  Unlike other readers, she, for some reason, believed it. <br><br>  And so they met. <br><br><h4>  A meeting </h4><br>  The guy, exhausted by the disbelief of the whole world in his ideas, came to some 1st seminar, and read a couple of reports about his experience.  After the report, several people approached him, as usual, asked questions - but the guy knew that interest would run out on that.  I got ready to dump the hotel room, but then a girl approached him.  Yes, not one, but with its director. <br><br>  We went to the coffee shop, nice talked for an hour.  They asked specific questions, delved into the details, evaluated the risks.  But the guy, naturally, was in seventh heaven with happiness - for the first time, his ideas became very seriously interested in his ideas. <br><br>  The girl and her director were interested in the same problem that the guy considered key - how to turn the acceleration of the work of programmers into money.  After some deliberation, a hypothesis was put forward - to equalize the clock. <br><br>  Any task of the maintenance department has several metrics in hours.  The first assessment is the one that the programmer gives (‚Äúwell, I‚Äôll do it in 4 hours‚Äù).  The second assessment is the one agreed with the client.  The third metric is how much a programmer actually spent. <br><br>  So, in the escort departments, if to summarize, the actual time spent is always more than that sold.  Often, the programmer is mistaken in the assessment - we are peculiar to optimism.  Often the manager cannot sell the task for the hours it costs.  Often, the task is evaluated by one programmer, and the other one is evaluated by the one that is less versed in context.  There are many reasons, but the fact is that it sells less hours than it spends. <br><br>  This guy watches and proposed to equalize - this is the goal.  He claimed that he can accelerate programmers?  If you make sure that the watches sold are equal to the spent, then, like, and the money should be more.  On that and went. <br><br><h4>  Start </h4><br>  A few days, then - a few weeks, the guy was waiting for what they write to him or call - or the girl, or her director.  But from them - neither hearing, nor spirit.  At first the guy was upset, he tried to write himself a couple of times, but he did not dare.  In the end, he convinced himself that they were regular interested ones. <br><br>  But after two months, sometime in November, they wrote to him.  There was no limit to delight - they were really preparing to switch to his methods!  A limited number of participants - only 5 people, but really, really go! <br><br>  The girl asked questions about the methodology, asked if there were any developments in task management systems, so as not to make a fuss, but at that time the guy had nothing.  Of course, he answered questions, studied the plan of changes, tried to give some advice.  But the girl was gone again. <br><br><h4>  First results </h4><br>  It appeared two months later, at the end of January.  Her test team had been working under the new rules for a month. <br><br>  The guy explained to me like that.  Of all that he knows about the acceleration of the work of programmers, about 10% were published in the public domain.  The girl from these 10% took about half of the methods and practices.  So, she took advantage of 5% of his knowledge. <br><br>  The results of the first month were simply stunned by the girl - she managed to increase the ratio of hours sold to hours spent by 40%.  Roughly speaking, now programmers spent 60% of the time trying to sell the same amount in money. <br><br>  The guy was extremely happy, but the letter was written to the girl in rather restrained tones. <br><br><h4>  Fracture </h4><br>  The second month of using the practice did not bring any special results.  As the guy told me, it almost always happens - the euphoria of the first month overshadows the eyes, and at best everything remains in place, and there is a regression, which makes one doubt the success. <br><br>  However, the third month put everything in its place.  Right now, attention.  As the dead Mikhail Zadornov said now, alas, take more air in the chest ... <br><br>  In the third month, they increased revenues by 1.5 times.  Or in another way - by 50%.  Profit also increased, because  fixed costs remain the same. <br><br>  After these results, a fracture occurred.  Moreover, the guy and the girl. <br><br>  The guy, having learned about such results, went into a two-day binge.  He says this happened to him for the first time in his life.  The result of the girl decided not only his two problems - to prove the effectiveness of the technique and transfer it to money, but also the third one - rejection.  This problem was not acute, but already realized. <br><br>  It is understandable.  The guy turned out to speed up work in two companies, but he himself was the key link in the system - everything was done not only in his presence, but also under his direct supervision.  And here his participation, in fact, was limited to one meeting before the start of work and several letters filled with more polite business phrases than useful information. <br><br>  A turning point in the girl's life was not so joyful.  After consulting with the director, she decided to talk about her experience at the general meeting of the company. <br><br><h4>  Surface current </h4><br>  At the general meeting, according to tradition, was attended by all employees of the company.  The girl made a presentation, spoke about the essence of the changes and, most importantly, the results.  There was a thin applause, and the meeting ended.  Its format did not involve discussions. <br><br>  The next morning she went to work, anticipating a lot of meetings, conversations and pleasant words from her colleagues.  Guess how many colleagues came to her to learn the details? <br><br>  That's right, exactly zero.  As if nothing had happened.  Just think - the revenue grew by one and a half times, without costs, consultants, new accounting systems, changes in motivation, etc.  Does this happen every month in every company? <br><br>  She worried for a couple of days, but being a serious girl and focused on results, she spat and stopped waiting - just continued her activities. <br><br>  First of all, I expanded the scale of my experiment to the whole department.  Began to introduce a couple more chips from the materials of that guy.  Began to more closely analyze the results.  But then it was time for a regular meeting with the director. <br><br>  And here, as they say, it turned out.  It turned out that the director had already managed to talk with all managers about the new approach and its results.  Managers divided into two camps: neutral and opponents. <br><br>  Neutrals, as expected, said: yes, not bad, but let's see what happens next.  Opponents, naturally, said that garbage is all.  Just random success.  Not at all related to its changes.  It's not enough - there are more applications from customers, or they successfully passed them quickly, without ordinary iterations.  Although the numbers showed that there were no more applications. <br><br>  Thus, a surface current of resistance appeared, which tried to carry our girl into the open ocean.  Just so, just in case. <br><br>  But suddenly found undercurrent. <br><br><h4>  Underwater current </h4><br>  If you are not familiar with the typical system of remuneration of programmers in French 1C, then I will briefly explain.  They receive piecework wages for hours sold to customers.  For example, 400 rubles per hour.  I don‚Äôt know what their bet was there, but the principle is the same in most cases. <br><br>  Main feature - only sold hours are paid.  If a client pays for work for 4 hours, and you do it in 8 hours, you still get it in 4 hours. <br><br>  And now recall the results.  Revenue, i.e.  the number of hours sold increased by 1.5 times.  There were no distortions in people, i.e.  for each programmer in the test group, the output increased, on average, by 1.5 times.  Well, and a simple conclusion - they began to earn 1.5 times more money. <br><br>  Naturally, the rest of the programmers in the company found out about this.  First - colleagues from the same escort department, then all the rest. <br><br>  The situation was aggravated by the fact that the test group was much easier to work with.  They, unlike the others, in general, from the word completely, stopped working on weekends and overtime.  They had no deadlines for the tasks and, as a result, hassle, unpleasant conversations with customers and sales managers, time-trouble, etc.  Now, when they began to receive more money, in general began to go to work, as on a holiday. <br><br>  Programmers from other departments discussed these lucky ones, mostly among themselves.  Those who tried to talk to their leaders received a tough response and did not try again.  But the undercurrent intensified. <br><br><h4>  Defectors </h4><br>  Some programmers could not sit still, and asked to be transferred to the support department.  Basically, these were the guys from the project teams who occupied far from leading roles there - as they say, bring and serve. <br><br>  In general, the practice of transitions took place before, but mainly in the opposite direction.  New employees came, as a rule, to the support department, they learned the basics of programming on 1C and standard configurations, and when they reached a certain level, they were taken to projects. <br><br>  The stereotype that the main money comes from projects has been and remains very strong.  Therefore, transfers to the escort department, which were previously considered something of a lowering or reference to hard labor, were puzzling. <br><br>  The first two defectors were released without problems - as mentioned above, they were not very valuable employees.  The third has already had a scandal. <br><br>  Heads of other departments and project teams came together to the director with a complaint.  They sincerely believed that the girl leads a secret war, lures employees, and, in general, destroys the company. <br><br>  The director had to make a difficult decision and freeze transitions.  The third defector was denied the translation.  Jobs in the escort department also had to be closed in order to appease the strong surface current. <br><br>  And in the accompaniment department everything was spiky. <br><br><h4>  Success development </h4><br>  Over the next month, the entire escort department switched to a new method of work.  The increase in revenue did not happen, but there was no fall - just remained at a factor of 1.5. <br>  But the next month was another breakthrough - 1.8 (in relation to the average revenue before the start of changes).  Another month, and the ratio rose to 2. <br><br>  The girl continued to correspond with the guy, about once a month.  He tried to tell her about other methods and new practices.  And the girl told him, basically, about the political component of the transition process - in fact, from there all the information presented in this article. <br><br>  The farther away, the less she was concerned about the opinions of her colleagues.  At first, if you remember, she was going through - well, just a few days.  Now she was completely indifferent to what others think.  The only person-manager whose opinion mattered is the director. <br><br>  The director could spoil everything if he went in the wake of the majority.  For a short while, the truth is - the girl understood that she would not abandon the methods she had mastered.  As a last resort, you can always go to another company, to a similar position, and continue your practice there. <br><br>  The director probably understood this (for sure, neither I, nor the boy, nor the girl know this).  A successful circumstance was that the director was at the same time the owner of the company, so raising the profits of one of the departments was his direct interest. <br><br>  Therefore, the director continued to balance.  The girl supported, but secretly.  In open space, adhered to neutrality.  Certain adjustments to calm other leaders, as I wrote above, made.  In general, well done director. <br><br><h4>  Feedback </h4><br>  Amazing things started to happen here, from a completely unexpected side.  But more about that another time. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/449796/">https://habr.com/ru/post/449796/</a></p>
