I didn‚Äôt think that I‚Äôll ever publish so far from IT here, but let's try it, since new topics allow it.  Now I will tell you exactly how we teach our sellers.  If you physically sell something - this is a guide, how not to mess it up.  Mechanics grind about three years. <br><br>  <b>So, first and foremost in retail - the seller must be confident in his product.</b>  If the product sucks, which needs to be put in, then the seller will receive such a wild curvature of the psyche in a month that it will not be possible to release it to living people.  The product must be such that you can calmly sincerely talk about it - and so that people take it after that.  This is the basis of marketing.  Confidence in the product - the basis for all other principles.

      Now look at the process of sale.  It is divided into five steps - greeting, ambush, development, presentation, sale.  The most common mistake of greeting is that the seller is most likely not a doctor.  Therefore, ‚ÄúCan I help you with anything?‚Äù Is anywhere, but not in the walls of our store.  Properly smile and say hello to a man when he comes to the point.  Set the mood and indicate that you saw it.  And that's all.  Do not climb to it and do not even approach.  The man came in - no need to lash out. <br><br>  Although not, before proceeding to the points, we will discuss the preparation. <br><br>  Our main principle in the attitude of the buyer is to treat him as a friend.  These are not beautiful words, but one very concrete thing - do not do anything that you would not do with a friend. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  If you are asked to advise - advise as advised to a friend.  Confident and accurate.  If you do not know, say so, and find someone who knows.  If a friend wants to buy something that he does not need - dissuade.  Yes, our sellers can discourage them - for example, this often happens when dad wants to buy a helicopter for a 4-year-old child.  The average duration of such a flight is one and a half seconds;  from the floor to the chandelier.  Therefore, if dad takes exactly the little son (and not himself) and stands, dripping saliva on the floor with a wad of money in his hand - you have to politely move this pack aside and advise him a typewriter.  Even if it is cheaper.  Even if there is a chance that after this he will understand that the helicopter is not the goal of life, and will go to another place. <br><br>  Because with your friend you would do the same.  More precisely, for a friend. <br><br>  You can sell games for less than the customer wants - because they fit better.  You can do a lot to make your friend feel good.  Because if a person understands that they are helping him here, and not pushing him in - and, for example, you will help choose a very good gift - he will come back.  Because they will trust you. <br><br>  One person buys for 3-4 years seven and a half games.  Seven and a half!  That is, giving up a slightly more effective "here and now" strategy for aggressive selling, you do so that the check increases several times.  In perspective. <br><br>  Continuing about the training.  The store should be clean (we have a whole checklist, how to check it), and the seller should look normal.  Therefore, the seller also has requirements.  The first is the look.  We don‚Äôt care what a person looks like if he doesn‚Äôt create an impression of negative with his appearance.  Actually, this is at the discretion of the senior point, but in order not to cause unnecessary questions, we introduced two simple rules - nothing black in clothes and nothing that would inevitably infuriate your parents - like a kilogram of metal on your face.  Well, even after a couple of cases, a ban on ultrashort shorts (which are shorter than the ass) was introduced.  Red hair is not a question.  Mohawk and tie - no question.  Swimsuit - well, probably not in Moscow.  In general, you understand.  Sometimes these requirements are imposed on top of the requirements of the shopping center.  For example, headphones are strictly forbidden at some airports, and in the Golden Babylon you should never replace slippers. <br><br>  During the shift, you cannot talk on the cell phone and push it into it (the exception is the business phone of the store).  The device should not call - is transferred to silent mode.  Naturally, something urgent is not a question, but when a buyer comes in and the seller speaks by phone, this is a complete star.  In some stores we have corporate clothes - accordingly, you need to prepare winter and summer uniforms for people in advance.  The seller must also have a badge with a large, clearly and legibly written name.  From the seller, of course, should not smell tobacco or alcohol.  In a number of shopping centers there are requirements for dress code for makeup, shavenness, unshavenness, and so on. <br><br><h3>  Ambush </h3><br>  Now for the sale process.  In fact, the second step is called ‚Äúestablishing contact‚Äù, but its essence is completely different.  So you do not stare, but while watching the buyer.  Where he went, what he saw, what was in his hands, why he even went at all, and so on.  After two or three months of work, it is already possible by the person‚Äôs mind to say that he wants to buy.  But still there are surprises. <br><br>  So, greeted and moved away.  By the way, it is very important how they said hello.  Our inner school is taught this: it is important to stand, not blocking the path to the buyer.  In each store there are two "hot" ways - the trajectory from which the inspection of the goods begins.  You can not stand on them.  Even at this moment it is not necessary to somehow show your coldness.  It is clear that a good mood and ability to greet comes with experience.  But so far there is no experience - at least make sure not to take a closed posture (for example, arms crossed over your chest).  The timbre and loudness of the voice are also important, not too quiet, not too loud.  You need to look into your eyes when you greet.  Best nod.  And, of course, smile, but not an American aggressive smile, but a normal one, without a sense of conscious need.  Then all this can be forgotten and even from the threshold of throwing a ball to a person with a shout of ‚ÄúCatch‚Äù, if suddenly you understand that you need to do this. <br><br>  You can say hello like this: ‚ÄúGood afternoon!‚Äù - and in a couple of seconds add, - ‚ÄúIf you need something, I‚Äôm standing there, okay?‚Äù. <br><br>  Now the man himself goes to the store, gets pleasure.  Watch what he does.  If you walked up to a rack with children's games and watched one by one, you probably choose a gift for your child (note that such things require clear navigation inside the store). <br><br>  Now you need not to miss the signal that the person is still waiting for the seller.  Such a signal could be a turn of the head in search of someone alive (looked, looked, and then looked around), just a question for the seller.  If there is a feeling that now you can come up, and it doesn‚Äôt hurt (a minute at the second minimum) - you should come up and start a dialogue.  If it didn‚Äôt go away, go away again and don‚Äôt bother without direct treatment. <br><br>  The dialogue is usually based on the information collected.  For example, it could be: <br>  - Good game.  Yes, this one is in your hands.  Yesterday we just played with friends.  Do you want to open the box, I'll show you everything? <br>  - Yes, tell me, please. <br><br>  <i>or</i> <br>  - Are you looking for a gift for your daughter? <br>  - Yes, and you have something for 6 years? <br><br>  <i>or here's how a couple of days ago on Tverskaya:</i> <br>  - Listen, you have so many packages with you.  Let's put them here to make it easier for you? <br><br>  <i>or, as it was, when I saw a man in the ‚Äúturtle‚Äù on Taganskaya:</i> <br>  - Man, put this thing.  You need a more complicated game, right? <br>  - Well, great.  How did you guess? <br>  - You're a biker.  You are standing in a shop on Taganskaya, you watch ‚ÄúBoom‚Äù.  I think you defended your doctor yesterday. <br>  - Candidate and the day before ... Stop, eh, from where? <br><br>  These ‚Äúhits‚Äù often mean the beginning of completely plague stories.  Once, for example, a very sad girl came to us to a store in Petersburg and said the following in a dull voice: <br>  - And show me the game more interesting. <br>  The seller thought and said: <br>  - I will not. <br>  The girl looked at him with big eyes and asked a few surprised: <br>  - Why? <br>  - Because while you are so sad, you still can not play.  You will still be.  What happened? <br>  - Yes, my brother got married today. <br>  - And you need the most terrible game, so that he and his wife quarreled while they are playing? <br>  The flame in his eyes fired up. <br>  - Oh, no, this is for my girlfriend ... <br>  For the next 10 minutes, the normal mood returned to the girl, she played Jenga, told about herself, her brother, then left for half an hour and returned with a friend to choose more games. <br><br>  Dialogue must begin at the correct distance - usually an outstretched hand.  Next - impolite, closer - already personal area.  In different cities, the optimal distance is different, by the way.  It is necessary to stand either from the side or for three hours - but not in the front and not behind. <br><br><h3>  There is a contact </h3><br>  If a person is talking - the next step begins.  You need to understand what and for what he needs.  This identification needs.  In our case, it is important to understand how much a person will be, how old a person is or who is preparing a gift.  Any details can be important: the time of the event, where it will be played (the train!), What style of games you like, whether you need a bright gift box.  For typical cases (a combination of age and number of people), there are already well-known games - we calculate them for those after which the person most often returns.  The logic is that the more people like the game, the greater the chance to fly with a minimum of data.  This is the usual mathematics - we choose products that are optimal from the point of view of game theory, and we deliver them to the sellers in the form of priority goods in the display.  But, as a rule, a good seller still receives information that allows you to advise something more special (the benefit in one store is usually from 175 to 450 game titles). <br><br>  It is important not to ask closed questions at this stage ‚Äî that is, those that can be answered with ‚Äúyes‚Äù or ‚Äúno.‚Äù  Questions should be open. <br><br>  Choose a pair of those games that are best suited.  First, the first is shown, if suddenly something is wrong - the second and third.  This stage of the relationship is called ‚Äúpresentation.‚Äù  It is necessary to give the buyer a box in his hands so that he can touch it, smell it, leave the wall, then open everything and show it.  Ideally, play quickly so that he understands the sweetest.  For this stage, we also have a salesman‚Äôs school - we learn to play the most interesting moments in games in 30-50 seconds.  This is, in fact, part of the animation, which is why the retail world knows us, in particular, for the technology of replacing sellers with animators in stores. <br><br>  Super-complex games are not so laid out, but 90 percent of the range has a special ‚Äúdemo version‚Äù, which the seller knows how to quickly show.  Naturally, we keep open boxes for almost everything (the exception is rare single games, but we will open them too, if necessary - they just don‚Äôt open up).  At this stage, frequent mistakes are the explanation for the box (without giving it open to the person), and the game is too complicated. <br><br>  Now a little distracted.  What does the seller do in the store?  Obviously sells.  Why can not replace it with a machine with a button?  Because the seller is able to show and tell about the goods, choosing it for people.  In practice, this means that a person, perhaps, went behind one specific game, bought it, calmed down - and then played with him in another 2-3, and he decided for himself what to take next time.  Or just looked for an abstract gift, and then I realized that we have a lot of things in particular, and you can always go before birthdays and a new year.  Or even wanted one thing, and he sold something better and cheaper.  In general, active selling is when the seller has done something, which has made the person more understandable and better.  When a buyer enters the store, the seller shows him the game, he likes it, but he does not buy - this is also an active sale.  The man left with knowledge about this game, most likely, will return a couple of weeks after the payday. <br><br>  However, usually the good work of the seller leads to an increase in the average number of goods in the check.  As a single metric, it is not necessary to use it (because if you evaluate the work of the store only by this parameter, postcards and erasers will appear in the checks), but in combination with the number of checks and the average sale price - it taxis. <br><br>  In general, as Uncle Willingheim said, <i>‚ÄúTo sell means to help the buyer to get what he needs, and to contribute to his good mood before, during and after the purchase.‚Äù</i> <br><br>  When there is no product, there is such an old etude.  I will quote this piece from our book ‚ÄúBusiness as a game‚Äù: <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúA man enters the store, asks for a game, which is obviously not there.  But then it is in the ‚ÄúChildren's World‚Äù in two blocks.  The first attempt is to propose an analogue unobtrusively.  But if you suddenly need a specific position - print the map and explain where to find someone else's store.  For most sellers it sounds like a uniform idiocy.  But let's look at the options from the point of view of game theory: the seller can try to tell that no one has such a position.  To lie.  The result - the client finds out the truth (and it's hard not to find out) and takes offense.  Minus three years of shopping in our expectation.  The seller can do nothing, simply saying that there is no game.  The client will leave, everything is at zero.  Then he will find somewhere or forget.  The seller can advise someone else's shop.  The buyer will go and buy his position.  And be happy.  And he will remember: we are so frostbitten that we help even in such cases.  Guess where he will go next time to buy a birthday present for a friend?  That is why we recommend doing this.  But at the same time, we know that only a seller who understands the essence will do so. ‚Äù <br></blockquote><br>  If a person leaves the store without a purchase, you must give him a business card with a 3% discount (we throw three such into the package at the time of sale - this is for friends, or for those who have not issued a card in the process). <br><br><h3>  Securing the sale </h3><br>  This is the last step.  Classical work with objections and the conviction that everything will be fine.  At this stage, the seller usually explains about the returns "if you have not approached the wallpaper," if the game in the action - specifies when this action ends.  Then, in fact, the technical part of the sale takes place - at the checkout, receiving payment, etc.  We have in the same place - filling out the questionnaire on the card, if a person needs it.  Immediately sellers warn that it will be at a discount in 3-4 days, if the person did not say in advance what he needs, for example, for his birthday tomorrow.  This is especially important to do for retirees, because they choose gifts in advance, and there is time, well, and because they are very worried when they buy something, and then the discount falls on it.  Again, you would also warn a friend. <br><br>  At the final stage, so-called upsell and cross-sell are made.  This is when you sell (or show) the supplement immediately with the main game.  Or when you, knowing that the game is a gift, offer packaging.  A more mundane example not from our sphere is this: a person buys hand weights for luggage.  You can sell him a battery right away (in case the first one sits down, the bundle is usually incomprehensible), but you can guess that it flies by Victory, and offer a light capacious briefcase. <br><br>  By the way, batteries.  The store should always have a lot of batteries for everything that is on sale (not the most expensive, but working).  And one set is always given free of charge, even if the batteries in the product itself are not included.  Because the goods are carried to play, and if it fails to turn on immediately, there will be a negative. <br><br>  At the same stage, a person usually sees valid promotions - in front of the cashier we have exhibited a handful of games of the week with discounts.  The mere type of discount that ends the day after tomorrow often evokes the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãbuying a game for the future. <br><br>  Now doubts to the ticket office.  Doubts usually arise as a result of our actions, when the seller did not give the buyer enough information or did not answer the questions correctly.  We are confident in the product, and it is necessary to convey this confidence.  If, at the presentation stage, the seller, by the way, talked about how he played it with friends ‚Äî or that he has such a game at home ‚Äî then the buyer believes more.  The personal word of the seller, whom you believe - it means a lot.  Therefore, in our free time, our people always play - not only to understand, but also to gain personal experience. <br><br>  Examples of bad options: <br><br>  - Well, I don't know.  See more shopping. <br>  So, with the choice of the game did not get.  Most likely, we are already losing the buyer, but we must try to take a blank check and show another good cheap game.  Why inexpensive - because the same can be a doubt about "there is not so much money." <br><br>  - It is expensive. <br>  This is what those who have money in half the shop surely say.  But you almost never hear this phrase as the only reason from a person who has 1000 rubles to pay.  Therefore, if a person says ‚ÄúThis is expensive‚Äù - this is not ‚ÄúI have no money‚Äù, but ‚ÄúJustify the price‚Äù.  And it is necessary to substantiate, for example - ‚ÄúLook, here is a box made of wood, plastic cards, and tin figures.  Do you want the same game cheaper - here, cardboard, wooden chips, thinner cards ... Or else cheaper with the same mechanics. ‚Äù <br><br>  Sometimes the buyer thinks hard and fluctuates between the options.  In this scenario, an experienced seller takes the situation into his own hands and decides for the buyer, - "Take this one, that's why."  And, of course, reminds about the trouble-free return.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Because if you choose will not work - a person will leave without anything at all. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Weeds are like this: suddenly argue with the buyer and somehow enter into disagreements, say parasitic words like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù (correctly - ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, but now I‚Äôll call for someone who played‚Äù), ‚ÄúWait‚Äù ( like hell?), ‚ÄúYou are wrong‚Äù (‚ÄúIt seems to me that there is a misunderstanding, look ...‚Äù), ‚ÄúI am new here‚Äù (and what?), ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs over there‚Äù (you have to go and show it) and so on . Although hell, of course, sometimes happens out of the blue. For example, just yesterday, one ice cream vendor to my question about the price just cut off: "The price tag is in front of you." She sincerely thinks that she must have something from the Soviet times, probably.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If for some reason, a negative or a dispute is brewing, you need to apologize and call the elder. All the problems and their solutions lie on his shoulders. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At the checkout, it is important to observe cash discipline. Simple things - first money in hand, then goods (there are </font></font><a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/mosigra/blog/225611/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">divorce schemes</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> that are based on non-compliance with this simple rule). At the checkout, it is important to give a free package, business cards for a discount in a package with an explanation that this is for friends (it works so brutally), put our ‚Äúnewspaper‚Äù in the package - a big flyer with something to read in the subway. In the same place - a card and the questionnaire or search of the person by phone, a surname or its bar code if the card is with him. In general, technical things. By the way, why else shops come across, where you can forget the card, and you will not be found by phone number, I can not imagine.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At the same stage, it is important to apply all the discounts that a person may have. Here you have to turn your head sometimes. For example, if, in general, the girl is not offended if she is asked if she is a student (this is a compliment to age), then once I rejected the signing of agreements on club cards Spartak and Dynamo, because they had a clause that it is necessary to ask at the box office whether a person is ill for Spartak or Dynamo. And so in the face for a short while to grab because of the question.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And, finally, once again - if a client is standing and giving you money, and you understand that he will not be happier, the transaction must be interrupted. Well, try to talk it out once. An example was such on Taganskaya. A girl of about sixteen is standing, she is spinning a hefty pink duck-heating pad in her hands (this is a microwave oven, she then gives out heat for about 20 minutes). The intern is ready to sell, suitable senior: </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Sorry. Is this for your boyfriend? </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Yes, he is so wonderful, he is an athlete, he runs; will be here after training on his feet to put, and he will be fine! </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Do you understand that the day when you present it to him may be the last day of your relationship? </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Why ?! </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Because it is a pink duck. I‚Äôm not very sure that a sportsman will like a soft toy. Pink Duck.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúHmm ... What then?‚Äù </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For two minutes they were still talking, after which our senior showed karting tickets through the quarter. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">She left, naturally, without buying anything. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The intern, a little podofigel, came up and asked: </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- I, of course, understand everything. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You are the eldest. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But what was it now? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">She was standing with money!</font></font> How so? <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At this moment the store door opens again, and there this girl smiles with all her teeth: </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Aah! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And I forgot to thank you! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You are so cool! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Now you will always come before the holidays, and I will bring more friends!</font></font></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/306592/">https://habr.com/ru/post/306592/</a></p>
