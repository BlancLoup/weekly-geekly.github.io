      The result of the <a href="http://rublacklist.net/6707/">annual monitoring of the</a> enforcement of laws on blocking (139- and 187-), during which information on blocked Internet resources was collected and analyzed from the relevant registries, the following data was obtained. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  During the year from the side of Roskomnadzor, Federal Drug Control Service and Rospotrebnadzor, the registers for 139-FZ ( <a href="http://eais.rkn.gov.ru/">eais.rkn.gov.ru</a> ) and 187-FZ ( <a href="https://nap.rkn.gov.ru/">nap.rkn.gov.ru</a> ) were entered for blocking and were subjected to it during the annual enforcement: <br>  <b>- 741 IP address;</b> <b><br></b>  <b>- 1392 Internet resource</b> . <br><br>  I emphasize that these are only those IP-addresses and sites that were downloaded by telecom operators to limit access to these resources. <br>  In total, much more resources were entered into the registry, according to which the decision was made that the information on them is prohibited in Russia, but later these sites either ceased to exist or deleted information that anonymous experts of supervisory agencies did not like. <br>  And as it was published on the Roskomnadzor website, such Internet resources of all were recorded in the register of more than 14.5 thousand. <br><br>  Returning to the blocked IP-addresses, as a result of the analysis of finding on them other domains that are not listed in the registries, it was revealed that: <br>  <b>83 215 Internet resources were improperly blocked</b> <br>  (due to finding these respectable resources at the same network addresses as this or that banned site) <br>  Or as a percentage: 98% of the total number of blocked resources. <br><br>  The graph shows the data of the <a href="http://rublacklist.net/bypass/monitoring-reestra-zapreschyonnyh-saitov/">monthly monitoring of the registry</a> : <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b3a/79b/4dd/b3a79b4dd423f130504f6352dec204cf.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><br>  Even if we discard the periodic jumps in the graph, there is a well-observed trend of increasing the number of locks of respectable Internet resources throughout the existence of the registry and law enforcement on blocking. <br><br>  Nevertheless, attempts are being made by the authorities to expand the categories of prohibited and illegal content. <br><br>  Let me remind you that now we are actively working on ‚Äúanti-piracy‚Äù legislation. <br>  A number of initiatives have already been drawn up to the bills and submitted to the State Duma: <br>  <a href="http://asozd2.duma.gov.ru/main.nsf/(Spravka)%3FOpenAgent%26RN%3D303374-6%2602">Bill No. 303374-6</a> (from Govorukhin - about fines for informational agents for 187-FZ); <br>  <a href="http://asozd2.duma.gov.ru/main.nsf/(Spravka)%3FOpenAgent%26RN%3D336400-6">Bill No. 336400-6</a> (from the Communist Party of the Russian Federation - the anti-anti-piracy bill on the abolition of 187-FZ) <br>  <a href="http://asozd2.duma.gov.ru/main.nsf/(Spravka)%3FOpenAgent%26RN%3D342640-6">Bill No. 342640-6</a> (from Schlegel - expansion of information categories on 187-FZ to all objects of copyright + separate edits leveling the negative impact of 187-) <br><br>  And in the middle of October, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/197828/">a</a> new draft law <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/197828/">appeared in the network</a> , expanding the ‚Äúanti-piracy‚Äù law, which was being prepared behind the doors of the Presidential Administration closed by the public. <br><br>  Also on one or another aspect in the sphere of ‚Äúanti-piracy‚Äù topics public discussions were conducted: <br>  - at the State Duma site on the bill of MP Schlegel: <a href="http://veche.duma.gov.ru/">veche.duma.gov.ru</a> <br>  - on the independent <a href="http://dialog.so/">dialog.so</a> site <br><br>  Deputy Schlegel is currently processing proposals and comments on the results of these discussions for submission to the relevant committee of the State Duma. <br><br>  Naturally, it is worth remembering how the experts at the ‚ÄúOpen Government‚Äù handled the requirements outlined <a href="https://www.roi.ru/complete/petition/gosudarstvennoe_upravlenie1/otmenit-zakon-o-proizvolnyh-blokirovkah-internet-resursov-ot-02072013-187-fz-zakon-protiv-interneta/">in our petition</a> . <br>  The text of the decision and expert opinion were presented <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/199006/">in the appropriate post on Habr√©</a> . <br>  And with the results of the vote <a href="http://nag.ru/articles/article/24046/reshenie-ekspertov-po-petitsii-zakonu-protiv-interneta-byit-.html">can be found here</a> . <br><br>  Recently, the ‚ÄúPirate Party of Russia‚Äù presented the so-called ‚Äú <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/temychk/ss-27914982">Anti-piracy Manifesto</a> ‚Äù (on the concept of a new social contract on copyright in the digital age). <br>  Connect to his discussion <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/201086/">can be on Habr√©</a> . <br>  But I think it is better to bring it to a wider platform for public discussion and the formation of a consensus position on the vision of how the relationship between the author, consumer and intermediaries between them should be built. <br><br>  <b>Well, from the side of state structures the active phase of monetization of laws on blocking has begun.</b> <br><br>  After adopting 187-FZ, in early August of this year, the Ministry of Communications in a note to the <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/temychk/97-187">draft Government Decree</a> on entrusting Roskomnadzor with the responsibility to maintain another registry, now illegal, asked to allocate from the budget <b>97 million rubles a year</b> for the supervisory authority to carry out its functions -FZ. <br>  But I ran into a problem: when adopting this law, the relevant committees of the State Duma decided that the adoption of the law ‚Äúwill not require additional expenses from the federal budget‚Äù and therefore does not require the conclusion of the text of the draft law by the Government of the Russian Federation.  Thus, if Roskomnadzor allocates at least 1 ruble from the state treasury to support the activities of 187-FZ, the process of adopting this law will go to the category of unconstitutional actions. <br><br>  Yesterday at a meeting of the Infopolitics Committee in the State Duma, it turned out which officials <a href="http://www.vedomosti.ru/tech/news/18436411/avtomat-dlya-piratov">found a way out</a> <br><blockquote>  Coordination with the government and ministries will not be necessary, since the amendments to the budget do not imply additional expenses, but only redistribute funds already allocated under the Information Society program, explains State Duma Deputy Speaker Sergei Zheleznyak </blockquote><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7c7/e88/c11/7c7e88c11d4da98cf786b7a7b26fb85b.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><br>  Irina Levova (RAEC) handed over the legal backlash in her <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php%3Ffbid%3D602339419825459%26set%3Da.426171857442217.97927.100001482188941%26type%3D1%26relevant_count%3D1">mini-report</a> from this meeting. <br>  Indicative and cheerful faces of the officials there in the photo. <br><br>  <b>And now attention: contests!</b> <br><br>  Roskomnadzor decided to go deep into the question of what else should be banned on the Internet, which areas and categories of information can still be covered by the law on ‚Äúblack lists of sites‚Äù and announced a competition to search for professional analysts who will, among other things, study pornographic content and provide Office services for the relevant examination of materials published on the Internet. <br>  <b>The initial contract price is 43 750 000 rubles.</b> <br>  <a href="http://zakupki.gov.ru/pgz/public/action/orders/info/common_info/show%3Fsource%3DEPZ%26notificationId%3D7247732">Government Procurement Contest Page</a> <br>  The name of the order: ‚ÄúThe right to conclude a state contract for the provision of services for the examination of materials and (or) information disseminated by means of the Internet information and telecommunications network to confirm the presence or absence of information in them, the dissemination of which is prohibited in the Russian Federation‚Äù. <br>  Customer: Roskomnadzor <br>  The deadline for submission of tender documentation: from 10.10.2013 to 12.11.2013 <br><br>  Many on the Web have already dubbed it a dream job: watch porn, analyze it, earn millions.  Well, share, of course, do not forget, how can it be without us, in Russia. <br><br>  A couple of days later, the Moscow City Court announced its competition, which accepts applications from right holders to impose preliminary interim measures to block Internet resources on the ‚Äúanti-piracy‚Äù 187-FZ.  This court also maintains a database of accepted statements and its definitions on blocking, which it gives Roskomnadzor for further actions to restrict access to sites. <br><br>  And so <a href="http://digit.ru/state/20131029/407381978.html">the question arose</a> of the need to automate the consideration of cases on the decision to block information: <br><blockquote> ‚ÄúThe Moscow City Court is looking for a developer solution for the automated support of the consideration of cases related to the protection of exclusive rights to films, including on the Internet.  The initial (maximum) price of a government contract is 100 million rubles, follows from the application posted on the government procurement portal. <br>  According to the technical requirements for the tender, the state contractor should provide opportunities for automatic submission of claims by the right holders, court proceedings in the Moscow City Court on cases of protecting the rights to films, providing access to information on the progress of cases, as well as informational interaction between the court and Roskomnadzor. data on the progress of cases). ‚Äù </blockquote><br><br>  Information about this competition on the portal "State Procurement" could not be found, but there is information about the competition from the Ministry of Communications.  Perhaps this is the very competition, although some data are different from what RIA Novosti brought in its publication. <br><br>  <b>The initial contract price is 71,246,500 rubles.</b> <br>  <a href="http://zakupki.gov.ru/pgz/public/action/orders/info/common_info/show%3Fsource%3DEPZ%26notificationId%3D7270140">Government Procurement Contest Page</a> <br>  The name of the order: ‚ÄúAn open competition for the right to conclude a state contract for technological work on the creation of an information system that provides identification and recording of recorded audiovisual works and phonograms in digital form, as well as informing about the established mode of their use, as part of the national information and communication platform for distribution of digital content, and conducting a study to assess the effectiveness of system implementation.
