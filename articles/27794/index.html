  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Victory! Victory! Victory?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  What to write in the first post?  And what worries, about that and write. <br>  And I have been worried lately by the dizzying achievements of the great and immense country in which we live.  And worries, not because it is bad, but because it is good.  Very good. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Putin <br>  Well, what can I say, our former president, in spite of all the criticism and the "stones in his garden", led the country to the TOP level.  And there are many indicators.  Life during the eight years of Putin's rule has consistently improved. <br>  LEGALITY in these years was not an empty sound, now any sane citizen can offhand retell several articles from labor, angular or other codes, I‚Äôm not talking about the Administrative Code, soon motorists will know it by heart.  In one of the latest issues of Computerra, I read a detailed article on an automated system for monitoring road violations, which will be launched in Moscow in the near future.  This system consists of cameras installed on the roads and a head processing center, punishing unsuspecting drivers and sending fines directly to car owners.  And this system, just, will bring the law to a new level, saving us from the fat-bellied wizards with striped magic sticks.  And who used to think about how to pay taxes on a car or not?  The progress of legality can be observed in the field of information technology.  About 10 years ago, someone thought about what he wrote in the forums, what software he should buy a license or a disc with hundreds of first-class programs, then you need a license for telematic services for a hosting provider (the person who wanted to get a license for telematics would be considered alien).  Is it possible 10 years ago to imagine a company operating completely in the "white"? <br>  The word LAW is no longer an empty sound for us. <br>  SPORTS in Russia is also on the rise.  Zenit wins the UEFA Cup.  Achievement.  Bilan takes first place in Eurovision.  Achievement.  For the first time in 15 years - the world hockey champions.  Achievement.  European Football Championship.  This is not Eurovision for you ... This is the most popular and most ‚Äúclassroom‚Äù sport in the world.  These are 23 most athletic, young and strong guys of the country.  This is a prepared team of like-minded people together ready for anything.  Russia in the quarter finals.  First!  Achievement!  Let's see what will happen in the game with the Dutch.  As soon as they started to win, all the yards were filled with young, playing football.  What does it mean?  And only that in 10 years we will have a team even stronger! <br>  REGIONS are not now associated with the beginning of the 90s.  The Medvedev project on gasification of the whole country is being successfully implemented, I can confirm this, according to friends who received gas in the villages.  The Internet penetrates deeper and deeper into the regions - all regional centers are already on the ‚Äúleased line‚Äù. <br>  INDUSTRY.  Sore spot.  Every child knows that for the development of the country it is necessary to raise industry.  They waited!  Plant LOGOVAZ plans to build a new plant and release five (!) New models within five years.  Oil and gas are not discussed at all - today every day one can hear about plans to build more and more new "pipes" for pumping dollars in exchange for gas.  Began to come news about the design of new passenger aircraft.  For the first time in 10 years, a satellite was launched into space from the Amur base in Russia. <br><br>  Excites.  Excites because it is good.  Because it is very good.  Strange.  Fearfully. <br></div>
