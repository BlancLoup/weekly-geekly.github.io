  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Conference ProfsoUX-2013 - review-classification + video</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Last year I filmed and broadcast the St. Petersburg conference <a rel="nofollow" href="http://2013.profsoux.ru/">ProfsoUX-2013</a> , dedicated exclusively to usability.  All records were promptly mounted (“speaker + screen + hall”) and published a week later. <br>  But it’s only now that I’ve got my hands on seeing them myself, and offering a quick review-classification, with links to videos, so that you can see exactly what you’re potentially interested in (alas, nobody wrote a review except me, I have to do everything myself ).  However, UX is a fundamental thing and all ideas, thoughts, solutions are still relevant. <br>  All reports were short (&lt;20 minutes) and dynamic, the industry is young, there are no academic wedding old generals, only young professionals, leading UX-dog breeders, masters of eytreker and neurotransmitters, I will also try to make the review brief, without spreading my thoughts on the tree, making simple homemade classification. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><br><h3>  UX Philosophy </h3>  There are reports about the global and strategic: trends, concepts, approaches. <br><br><br>  “ <a rel="nofollow" href="https://vimeo.com/66770649">Little Tips for Designers</a> ” - Imposing Maxim Tkachuk, dressed in the style of “Stevjobs, and even in designer glasses”, reflected on the evolution, both in the design and the UX, and on the evolution of the career of a proper usability.  The history of design as a conscious competitive advantage, about the main trends and their causes (“post-war minimalism”, “ipad spawned adaptive design”), and, in fact, practical advice on both design (“Small First”) and career (“Zoom Out, remove Photoshop and go to the dark business side).  By the way, he was given the main prize of the conference. <hr>  “ <a rel="nofollow" href="https://vimeo.com/66770783">Second-hand design</a> ” - Yes, everyone knows that “Un artista copia, un gran artista roba”, which in the design world has long become “steal @ prosper”, and then just about how to do it right, do not become the laughing stock and victim of cargo (“govnosayty under Win8”), and vice versa, where you can relax with research, and trust trends (“carousel or parallax?”, “skeomorphism or delicious flat chest?” ...) adding only “animating” trifles . <hr>  “ <a rel="nofollow" href="https://vimeo.com/66770844">NUI or why the hand will not get tired</a> ” - Evolution of interfaces from the good old command line to the unknown Natural UI.  Stories about wearable computers, augmented reality, Aytreker interfaces for people with disabilities and neural interfaces for additional non-verbalization.  Reflections on where this may be necessary, and where <s>not having sewn it on are</s> probably unnecessary.  It is a pity that even though the speaker brought a box with Leap Motion, nothing was shown live.  I highly recommend speakers on this topic to do Tru demonstrations → here, back in 2011, there were <a rel="nofollow" href="https://vimeo.com/33406131">live NUI demonstrations with self-written software</a> on WUD.  Unfortunately, there was also no clear answer - what UX-designers are actually preparing for - here I will take this opportunity to recommend the series “ <a rel="nofollow" href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A7%25D1%2591%25D1%2580%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE_%2528%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%2529">Black Mirror</a> ”. <hr>  “ <a rel="nofollow" href="https://vimeo.com/66781143">Gamification in Action</a> ” is, of course, about the “gamification” that hovered in everyone’s ears, at least everyone knows that it’s all about “karma, badges and other achievements”.  However, if you need to systematically design game mechanics, this knowledge is not enough - it turns out in the spirit of “we will make karma and rob korovanovy”, then you need some matan who needs to eat either from thick books and long courses on the cursor, or - looking at this short report, where a formal octalization system for building a balanced game model.

    <h3>  Best practices </h3>  There are specific stories about aspects and practices, how to do it correctly. <br><br><br>  Let's start with the design - “ <a rel="nofollow" href="https://vimeo.com/66776710">“ Methods for describing and visualizing UX</a> ”- how to do it effectively?  Stupid to describe the actions of the characters?  Long and dreary.  “Story Mapping” - highlight goals, decompose into tasks, and search for the basis of UX-tools for solving?  "Question answer"?  "Customer Journey"?  Or even quit writing, and drawing more comic books is Story Boarding. <hr>  After a descriptive design drawing, it is important to start getting feedback and pumping up hypotheses for efficiency - and this is “ <a rel="nofollow" href="https://vimeo.com/66770743">Rapid Prototyping for the Web and Mobile Devices</a> ” - a report by a Canadian specialist in English, but with a cool almost-simultaneous translation (as observed, the translation is more successful in the original report ).  Here and Prototype Philosophy (or some ignoramuses confuse the prototype with information architecture, layout, wireframe, and the first versions of the software), to specific tool tips - from Powerpoint + Keynote (very controversial idea, IMHO) to probably the most popular Axure (more than half of the audience raised their hands), and more fashionable web services, such as proto.io. <hr>  How to improve a product when the first steps of technical tasks and prototypes are already discarded, the product is alive and in flight?  - “ <a rel="nofollow" href="https://vimeo.com/68124570">Hand in hand with efficiency - split tests</a> ”.  Do not waste time on subjective focus groups - A / B testing on the entire real audience will give the most correct answer.  More conversion, more!  Grow Hacking!  Actually here, yes, marketing is also related to the UX area, but still different - hardly at least one designer and UX-er can use Comic Sans in its presentation (the audience was shocked, Twitter exploded, and the speaker was interested on the sidelines " such? "). <hr>  “ <a rel="nofollow" href="https://vimeo.com/66776656">Designing an adaptive interface</a> ” - Yes, the advent of smartphones and other tablets is forced to cram in nevpihuemye dextkopno-web interfaces into the embrasures of mobile phones - and then how to design and do it, how information blocks should be transformed, how to change content (“address and how to get more important in the mobile version ”), which khaki of human perception (gestalt-cropping pictures) can be used. <hr>  " <a rel="nofollow" href="https://vimeo.com/66770862">Screen applications with a lot of information</a> ."  It's very cool when you can design an interface in the spirit of aesthetic minimalism ( <a rel="nofollow" href="">picture-pro-interface-google-epp-ibusinessformi.jpg</a> ) for relaxed users who can be pampered with empty space and the beauty of parallax, and save on development and support using the above-mentioned adaptive design.  The question is what to do if the interface basically consists of tables with data - financial accounting interfaces, and at the same time, efficiency is needed - that is,  driving is not the aunt who needs to fill a dozen form-cards per day, but, for example, an amphetamine-charged trader.  Every pixel and movement counts here, and it’s necessary to understand how to pack as much information as possible and so that everything moves at the very least, without requiring many years of training. <hr>  And of course, a separate world of interfaces - games.  There was a fresh look at the igromir from the point of view of the classic webUXer - “ <a rel="nofollow" href="https://vimeo.com/66770699">Can a web interaction designer become a designer in the gaming industry?</a>  ".  On the one hand, it seems to be more complicated, and heaped worlds, classical metrics and generally many guitars are not applicable, on the other hand, this is the Environment that rules the user (I recommend Pelevinsky Minotaur Helmet as the mystical UX philosophy of computer environments) and yes , here they really steer a “helmet”, changing the camera angles in a cunning way, not letting them get distracted by constant animation, frightening them with sound, it’s scary to think what will happen when real helmets / 3D glasses come to the masses. <br>  A separate topic is the service interfaces of games, which can also be weakly gamified.  They still have an unsolved mystery - “Very often, the players look into the barrel of their tank before the start of the battle, for some reason we cannot understand” - can anyone explain in the comments? <br>  By the way, on the topic of “usability and World of Tanks” I shot other reports → “ <a rel="nofollow" href="https://vimeo.com/83564722">Year in the TANK.</a>  <a rel="nofollow" href="https://vimeo.com/83564722">Chronicles of the UX-laboratory</a> "," <a rel="nofollow" href="https://vimeo.com/31899422">Designing interaction in multiplayer online games</a> . " <br><br><h3>  Process </h3> There are more likely short-talk reports about where the UX actually lives, what is its place in development, how to build interaction and resolve conflicts with customers and with the team of testers, analysts / designers and developers, project and product managers. <br><br><br>  “ <a rel="nofollow" href="https://vimeo.com/66770680">UX research at all stages of product development</a> ” is a financial and accounting software, but it has been developed for a long time (See “ <a rel="nofollow" href="https://vimeo.com/23323542">Extreme Agile - Everybody Dances</a> ”) by a single large team with usability inside.  Do we need a medically cold usability laboratory, or home comfort, what conflicts have usbers with coders and designers, and how did they manage to win (“the programmers themselves asked for research!”), How to implement usability, and where to knock out resources.  The story in pictures and photos, everything is visually, although in some places it is sad to see the team’s densely-broken open space - can you really make a beautiful design in such difficult conditions? <hr>  “ <a rel="nofollow" href="https://vimeo.com/66770809">Where does design end and design start?</a>  "- clearly a business management view from customized development - as opposed to a purely designer-perfectionist approach, which is allowed only in very large product approaches.  Immediately you need to understand this line, between design, design and drawing, so as not to “play into the design” ( <i>forget the word “not like”</i> ), do not zafeit terms-money, and how to most effectively satisfy <i>exactly the customer</i> who makes the decision.  Conversely, in some places it is worth spending, so as not to scare the customer with rude sketches, and follow at least minimal classical advice to “non-designers about design” (white space, typography, grids, contrasts ...), or use standard Axuro libraries. <hr>  <a rel="nofollow" href="https://vimeo.com/66776688">Toyota</a> 's <a rel="nofollow" href="https://vimeo.com/66776688">Secret Samurai Technique</a> is also a managerial kung-fu on the topic of prioritization.  It’s rather a hybrid of the Lean UX with a very strange matan (a clever matrix of prioritizing coefficients, from some weakly defined <s>ceiling</s> figures for features that calculate their priorities. True, the speaker admitted that managers look at them, but act in their own way - and this is probably correct. <hr>  “ <a rel="nofollow" href="https://vimeo.com/66770887">Interface Research in Yandex</a> ” - Well, this is the pinnacle of the process, when the guys have EVERYTHING, and you can afford to make an Ideal Research-process (only research, no recommendations, strict scientific clarity and detachment - designing is a matter of the caste of engineers).  While most companies only dream of research, and the coolest are recorded in a queue to rent a couple of hours in an equipped laboratory with an eytreker (if someone doesn’t know, these devices cost tens of thousands, Tobii X120 $ 40K- $ 70K) I repeat, there is everything.  And an equipped laboratory with one-sided mirrors and a bunch of IT trackers (there are disturbing cases with portable IT trackers for trips) + neurotrackers +….  Own user base and <s>detective agency</s> contractors to search for special copies ("45-year-old iPhone user with ten leams in his pocket is going to buy an apartment", "Oh, how difficult it was to find a user whose main search was mail.ru").  In general, it is good to be rich and healthy + smart and beautiful.  Envy, OK. <br>  Nontrivial cases were also considered - “a blind girl keeps a blog, illustrating it with pictures from a search”.  By the way, almost no one approaches such a complex projectile as computer interfaces for the blind, and here, taking this opportunity, I will give a link to a report describing a complete desktop for the blind, written by the blind programmer himself → “ <a rel="nofollow" href="https://vimeo.com/75574535">Luwrain.</a>  <a rel="nofollow" href="https://vimeo.com/75574535">OS for people with vision problems</a> . <hr>  Here it is.  I hope someone will choose something for this weekend. <br>  But not everything got on the record - there were also blitz reports in the hall (I <a rel="nofollow" href="http://wiki.4intra.net/Blog:%25D0%25A1%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581_%25D0%25A4%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD/ProfsoUX-2013">also spoke about double panels there</a> ), and a workshop section (I didn’t take pictures, because from experience, it’s interesting to participate in master classes, but not so much), and communication on the sidelines, where you could catch the real responsible for the insane in your opinion the interface of some product and service.  Also, participants were rewarded there for activity (questions, contests there, etc.), so think - can you <a rel="nofollow" href="http://habrahabr.ru/events/4038/">reasonably participate live in ProfsoUX-2014</a> ? <br><br>  BTW, if you are interested in usability reports, I <a href="http://talks.rosalab.com/%25D0%259A%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F:%25D0%25AE%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8">still have them</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/214253/">https://habr.com/ru/post/214253/</a></p>
