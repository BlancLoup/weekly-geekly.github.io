  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Sure step vista?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  ‚ÄúMicrosoft confirmed that there was an error in the Windows Home Server operating system that was reported by several users.  It lies in the fact that when saving files of some applications, such as Vista photo gallery, One Note and Quicken, the files are damaged, which can lead to their loss.  Microsoft explains this by saying that the above applications do not have full support for shared folders, so when editing them on the server errors may occur. " <a name="habracut"></a>  How many idiotic mistakes have the most reliable system in the world already had?  Loss of files - it is generally in any gate.  And small-time happily report on all new copies sold of Vista.  I wonder if there are statistics killed Whist?  I personally only in December carried them down a dozen.  Licensed.  People buy laptops, ordinary systems with pre-installed Vista.  Those.  money is paid for this whist, small-sized ones in reports receive another plus sign.  Users enjoy some time for beautiful.  Then a few are puzzled by the so-called convenience and supposedly intuitive interface.  And, in a maximum of a week, the question follows: Lech, can you pour XP here?  Yes Easy! <br><br>  I do not know a single person who bought the whist and continues to work with it.  I know one who works with a pirate.  He draws cartoons in 3d.  So, 64-bit addressing gives a boost in rendering huge scenes.  This is the only plus, because of which people moved to whist.  Not paying a penny for it.  At the same time, for more or less pleasant work, I had to overclock the operative from one to four gigabytes.  Five more familiar to me engineers of service centers refused to work with Vista, at least until the first service pack (in the hope that it would somehow change something).  And 15 people, known to me, who bought whist, work with XP. <br><br>  I even put XP on the F3 series, for which they don‚Äôt have firewood on the official websites.  It is easier for people to rebuild XP installation distributions and dig the Internet in search of firewood for XP (well, or pay money to those who reassemble and dig) than to work with Vista, under which everything is, and under which this series is sharpened.  Which without whists and not even buy.  Judging by the forums, including English-speaking, where such issues are discussed, this is not a local situation with my neighbors, co-workers and drinking companions.

      Vista is bought by millions, and how many people are blowing it down?  It would be interesting to know, at least approximately, what percentage of whist purchased went into the trash bins, or abandoned in deep crates up to the best (for whist) times?  This is not about holivarah, (I have my opinion about whist, is familiar with the opposite and respect him, although I do not agree), but about simple statistics.  Does someone lead this?  Whist and praise and curse, but at the same time a lot of information about the millions of sales of information, and unpleasant for small-scale figures can not be found. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/19295/">https://habr.com/ru/post/19295/</a></p>
