      A standard account completely solves the tasks of a small team, but you already have to pay for the ‚Äúextra equipment‚Äù. <br><br>  The cool bonus from Slack is integration with many services (such as Dropbox, Google services, social networks, etc.).  For example, we have made our integration with <a href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a> , and more recently with Carrot Quest. <br><br><h3>  <b>WHY NECESSARY INTEGRATION</b> </h3><br>  The <a href="http://www.carrotquest.io/%3Futm_source%3Dblog%26utm_medium%3Dcontent%26utm_term%3Dsoldatov%26utm_content%3Dslack%26utm_campaign%3Dtools">Carrot quest service</a> monitors your users on the site (actions, completed forms, etc.) and enters this data into an individual user card.  You can be aware of all the actions of the visitor, know his name and email, his needs.  This knowledge will improve communication with the customer and will be a springboard for effective marketing. <br><br>  Monitoring of any event (almost any) can be configured in our service.  There are such events that it makes sense to monitor in real time.  For example, if a ‚Äúwarm lead‚Äù has entered your site, then the operator, having learned this, can immediately respond and involve him in a conversation, to spend on a purchase.  If we had not instantly received such a notice, the ‚Äúwarm lead‚Äù could have disappeared, and we would have missed the client. <br><br>  For such situations, where the speed of action is very important, we have integrated our service with Slack. <br><br>  In addition to notifications about events, you can also receive user data (names, emails, company sites, etc.). <br><br>  <b>Examples of why you need to receive notifications:</b> <br><br><ol><li>  A ‚Äúwarm lead‚Äù has come to you (a user who has already been interested in your product several times).  Involving him in communication will be an excellent step, after which, bring him to purchase.  Respond, write to him.  It is possible that he is already thinking about buying, he just needs a little "help." </li><li>  To understand which user came to the site, what product he bought in the end.  After that, in manual mode, start communicating and convert the client into a brand adherent. </li><li>  Payment.  If you have an online service, knowing that users pay consistently is important.  If you set up notifications about this, then there will be not only benefit, but also joy.  Agree, notifications about new payments - this is the reason for a great mood. </li><li>  The user has not completed the order (for example, dropped the basket), and has not yet left an email.  Before he leaves, you need to contact him and convince him to buy ( <a href="http://www.carrotquest.io/blog/triggernyj-chat-i-pop-up-speshat-na-pomoshh-esli-polzovatel-ne-ostavil-email//%3Futm_source%3Dblog%26utm_medium%3Dcontent%26utm_term%3Dsoldatov%26utm_content%3Dslack%26utm_campaign%3Dtools">chat and pop-up will help with this</a> ). </li><li>  Is there a place in your service where visitors stumble?  Receive notification as soon as a visitor has reached this place.  Go to his personal card and help him. </li><li>  The user has written a review or comment.  Most customers trust reviews posted on the site.  Therefore, it is necessary not only to monitor, but also to react to it.  This is important in different contexts.  For example, if you regularly do content marketing, then an excellent connection with the "reader" is guaranteed. </li><li>  And etc. </li></ol><br><h3>  <b>HOW WE USE INTEGRATION</b> </h3><br>  To improve our own product, we set up notifications in Slack about several client actions: <br><ol><li>  I went to the registration page 2 (the user entered their data); </li><li>  I went to the registration page 3 (the user started the site); </li><li>  Created a new application (client added a new site). </li></ol><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/32d/7ed/7cc/32d7ed7ccc4c39fc6d39514dac3b087c.jpg" alt="image07" width="868" height="536"></a> <br><br>  We follow the registrations to know exactly which customer registered with us and where he came from.  When we receive a notification, we review its website and relate to a specific area of ‚Äã‚Äãbusiness.  We will define and show you how our service will help to improve the work of his company.  Having done this, we can offer a useful selection of content for the client: instructions, articles, cases. <br><br>  After the first acquaintance with the service, some customers start using it on their other projects.  We have this event called "created a new application."  Our reaction in this case is the same as in the notification of registration steps. <br><br>  This is customer focus, isn't it?  After all, it allows you to instantly help customers of our service. <br><br>  Another small change, creating notifications about important targeted actions, you will provide yourself with a great mood - it's great to see that users need your product. <br><br>  About Slack and our other favorite tools we wrote <a href="http://siliconrus.com/2015/05/saas-tools/">an article</a> on Zuckerberg Call. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/5dc/f6b/f97/5dcf6bf974b136cb8f6501b21bc15797.png" alt="image06" width="990" height="343"></a> <br><br><br><br>  Each of the events created can be sent to Slack, and as soon as it is completed, you will immediately receive a notification (plus a link to the user card). <br><br>  Try different possibilities, it helped us. <br><br>  Big conversions and great mood.
