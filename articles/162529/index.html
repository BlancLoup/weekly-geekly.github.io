  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Creating the perfect player</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/900/ccc/a6c/900ccca6c0a7aacabe59bbf2e059ea3a.png"><br><br>  We all love music. <br>  With the advent of smartphones, portable players have become less in demand - no one wants to be hung with appliances from head to toe.  Music mobile applications are now more popular than ever. <br>  Thousands of applications claim to be the # 1 player in our devices.  But what do we get?  See how many players are installed on your music device?  One for podcasts, another for playing music from a phone, a separate application for searching texts and clips, and, most likely, a Vkontakte client for listening to their audio recordings (where can it be without it?).  Counted?  Well, as you say to deal with all this mess?  After all, everything can be much more convenient and better! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Let me introduce you to a truly convenient player that will combine all your music from various sources into a single playlist!  Why exactly Boomfox will become your player number 1? <br><br><h1>  All on the shelves </h1><br>  A convenient interface is like a clean room: and it‚Äôs nicer to stay, and you always know where things are.  We are sure that this is very important for music lovers, in whose library there are several hundreds or even thousands of compositions.  When designing Boomfox, we relied on three main criteria for an ideal music player: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      - Convenient interface.  The player should be as simple as possible and yet functional.  And, besides, mobile - so that it is convenient to manage it on the road. <br>  - Not just a big, but a huge music library.  The player must have access to all major music resources.  Including the resources that provide near-music information - lyrics, videos, biographies of the performers. <br>  - Autonomy or, in other words, independence from the Internet connection.  We want to listen to music without dividing the space on online and offline! <br><br><h5>  Without all this, the player becomes unnecessary, ordinary and inconspicuous.  So why save in your phone unnecessary and useless applications? </h5><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e5d/f80/3c1/e5df803c1468f9ea6cbe0e56cd78697e.png"><br><br><h1>  Sources </h1><br>  The basis of the player is the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãworking simultaneously with multiple sources of music.  While the player plays local music and audio from VKontakte.  Why did we give such priority to VKontakte music?  With all the controversies unfolding around this network, it still remains the most succulent source of music in runet.  In the future we will connect even more resources. <br>  However, in addition to music itself, Boomfox can collect near-music information ‚Äî for example, search for lyrics.  Now we teach him to issue smart recommendations and information on performers. <br>  In addition, for fans of statistics, support for Last.fm is built into Boomfox and all listened tracks are carefully scrambled, including tracks played without an internet connection. <br><br><img width="100" align="right" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/793/235/eda/793235edad6d74e5e81d0fafff4a5b47.png"><br><br><h1>  Play queue </h1><br>  It often happens that you find a track and you want to listen to it as follows, but creating a separate playlist for this is too lazy.  It does not matter - it is for this that we made a play queue - a dynamic playlist, accessible from any screen, in which you can always add new tracks or change their order. <br><br><h1>  Search </h1><br>  We are looking for everything, we are always looking, we are looking everywhere.  We are looking for thoroughly.  Boomfox can search simultaneously on all connected sources.  Smart search will first give the best matches for tracks already on the device, and then attach results from the connected resources to them. <br><br><h1>  Somewhere I have already heard ... </h1><br>  If you are crazy about indie rock, then why not add The Kooks or, for example, the same Kasabian to your player?  A fantastic convenient feature is available for this in Boomfox - a tape with recommendations.  The application automatically selects for the user new artists based on individual perception statistics. <br><br><h1>  In short, Sklifosovsky! </h1><br> <a href="http://boomfox.ru/"><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0d7/6f2/8bb/0d76f28bb74fb98c1b3697386a9de8d4.png"></a>  Our goal is to create a simple, breathtakingly convenient and at the same time functional player.  We subject every detail to thorough examination and carefully listen to the opinion of our users.  And without false modesty we can say - we succeed.  Do not believe?  Just <a href="http://boomfox.ru/">try it</a> ! <br><br><blockquote>  <font color="#666666"><i>While Bumfox is available only for users of Android devices, however, we are working hard on the iPhone version</i></font> </blockquote><br><h1>  PS </h1><br>  By the way, if someone is interested in some nuances of development for Android / iPhone - write about it in the comments, we will be happy to write an article or two to our blog :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/162529/">https://habr.com/ru/post/162529/</a></p>
