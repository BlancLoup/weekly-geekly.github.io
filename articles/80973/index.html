  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to get direct contacts of the CEO</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  There is a whole science called Overcoming the Secretary.  A lot of articles have been written on this topic and many techniques have been developed.  You can familiarize yourself with this direction of marketing.  For example, read Evgeny Balakirev (http://www.ippnou.ru/article.php?idarticle=002449) or Alexander Kormilitsyna (http://www.forbysip.ru/724212/1/Preodolenie-sekretarya).  Our talk today is not about that.  We will talk about how to get Boss's contact information without getting involved in exhausting negotiations with his cerbers and gatekeepers. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Office and personal e-mail</b> <br><br>  The email addresses of most CEOs are nowhere to be found, including on corporate websites.  However, you never know where you will find, where you will lose.  Therefore, still start by exploring the page of the website, which lists the contacts of staff.  If there is no link to the general mailbox there, wander around the site in order to clarify how personal email addresses are created in this company.  For example, if the address of a specialist in public relations Galina Petrova is g.petrova@company.ru, then the address of general director Viktor Ivanov is most likely: v.ivanov@company.ru.  Try sending a letter to him.  If it returns as undeliverable, create another one, and in the "address" field, drive in all possible options: vi@company.ru, viktor@company.ru, vikiv@company.ru, viktoriv@company.ru, vivanov@company.ru .  That address, the letter from which has not returned, is the required one.  The method works in 90% of cases.

      If your case hits the remaining 10%, try the following: <br><br>  First of all, look at the page of your favorite search engine: just enter the first and last name of the desired CEO.  A subsequent study of the results can lead us to the right person - if, of course, he somehow left his mark on the network. <br><br>  This approach will be very effective if the wanted person has a homepage, a weblog or profiles in countless social networks.  But this will only help if it is registered under its real name. <br><br>  Now the user is unlikely to be persuaded to voluntarily enter your address into a certain database, so there is no serious search engine for e-mail addresses today.  But you can try to search for the address on the InfoSpace portal, (www.infospace.com/info/wp/email). <br><br>  Particularly noteworthy are the popular social networks of our time, such as Odnoklassniki (www.odnoklassniki.ru) and VKontakte (www.vkontakte.ru).  Most likely, you can find the desired citizen in at least one of them.  True, this does not mean that his e-mail address will be listed there, let alone his phones.  Concerns about spam, as well as unwillingness to advertise yourself, usually take over.  Fortunately, social networks allow you to simply send messages to the PM.  However, the contacts made on these semi-entertainment resources are usually quite superficial and lightweight, which does not lead to serious conversations. <br><br>  It is quite another thing - business portals, for example, Webby (www.webby.ru) and Professionals (http://professionali.ru/Home).  Since most of the business people registered there are interested in new contacts, many leave an email address, and sometimes even a mobile phone number. <br><br>  If the current general once looked for work himself, there is a chance to find him on the site HeadHunter (http://hh.ru). <br><br>  <b>Work and home phones</b> <br><br>  All this is good, but there is one problem: among the bosses there are still often reactionaries that do not own a computer and are missing even in Odnoklassniki.  What to do if only a dull ‚Äúrequired combination of words is not found‚Äù is displayed in the search result window (or was the name so widespread that Google or Rambler provided hundreds of links)? <br><br>  An effective strategy in this case will be to search for telephone directories such as <a href="http://www.infobroker.ru/">www.infobroker.ru</a> , <a href="http://www.nomer.org/">www.nomer.org</a> , <a href="http://www.phone.rin.ru/">www.phone.rin.ru</a> (paid search), and so on. <br><br>  It is also popular in Russia (which remarkably characterizes the mentality of our compatriots) the Phonebook phone directory, which is banned by civilians.  The fact that it was released for internal use by the Ministry of Internal Affairs did not prevent it from penetrating virtually every home ÔÅä.  Ask your acquaintances, and with a maximum of the third attempt you will find the owner of such a secret reference book and ask him to copy the database to you on a disk. <br><br>  I hope you are lucky, and sooner or later you will hear in the receiver the coveted voice of the general.  And if he asks where you got his number from, answer honestly and ‚Äúwith a blue eye‚Äù: <br>  - I found it on the Internet. <br><br>  <b>Workaround</b> <br><br>  If none of the methods worked, do a little research: surf the Internet and the press for any events and people (including former employees) related to the company you need.  Print out all that you have found, then re-read the materials and circle the names one way or another connected with the company and the general director.  Pay more attention not to business, but to Boss‚Äôs public contacts.  The above methods try to find the phones of the most likely "suspects".  Then call and just ask the number of the general.  Surely one of them will be so vigilant that it will give you this terrible secret. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/80973/">https://habr.com/ru/post/80973/</a></p>
