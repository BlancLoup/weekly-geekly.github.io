      The proposal is relevant for media in major cities and companies providing services in the field of education, training, besides, you can cooperate with advertising agencies engaged in sales of online advertising.  You need to start providing paid advice on how to advertise in your media, develop training courses and take money for it. <br>  For hyper-local media here, perhaps, even more space.  Some of them are already teaching local business.  Some even take care of their sites.  This is an additional income. <br>  Here you can also organize direct marketing services via the Internet.  You can take money either for the development of an advertising campaign or for the number of recipients of the e-mail you send. <br><br><h4>  Business Exchange </h4><br>  Suitable for: media major cities, business publications <br><br>  You can organize a platform on which local businesses can publish information about their services, search for contractors, and announce tenders.  Here the local government will post announcements on public procurement and competitions.  Business will pay for access to the platform.  Such sites already <a href="http://www.rfpdb.com/">exist</a> , but you know better local business, you have direct access to the market.  In addition, such a niche audience will be easier to sell your specialized media products: analytics, reviews, research. <br>  Along the way, organize a catalog of companies and enterprises. <br><br><h4>  Membership </h4><br>  Suitable for: all <br><br>  Radio stations have been using this scheme for decades, handing out bags, hats, umbrellas for payments in support of them.  As the example of the New York Times shows, now it works for newspapers. <br>  It is not necessary to concentrate on souvenirs.  The Times for its members organizes meetings with popular journalists.  A similar scheme can work with access to certain types of content, events. <br><br><h4>  Event Organization and Promotion </h4><br>  Suitable for: all <br><br>  If the success of online media depends on the ability to develop and communicate with your audience, then gathering an audience in real life is a way to make money.  The Voice of San Diego believes that organizing events is a way to convey your content to readers, whether it is an analysis of past elections or an economic forum. <br>  Brooklyn Based organizes and advertises a lot of such events and takes a percentage of the tickets sold.  Revenues from this activity far exceed those that come from advertising on the site.  The <a href="http://www.brownstoner.com/">Brownstoner.com</a> blog has organized an incredibly popular <a href="http://brownstoner.com/brooklynflea/">flea market</a> .  Its author Jonathan Butler (Jonathan Butler) said that the market brought him much greater benefit than the opening of offices in other cities. <br><br><h4>  Cafe </h4><br>  Suitable for: media major cities <br><br>  Here you have an extreme variant of forming an audience - opening your own cafe.  Than to build the towers of your offices up to heaven, organize an editorial and newsroom right in the midst of the people.  Cafe will help you build a brand, of course, if the coffee will be delicious, and at the same time will become a platform for your events. <br>  This idea has already been implemented by the <a href="http://www.futuroom.cz/">Futuroom</a> project, whose goal is to ‚Äúreunite newspapers with readers and advertisers based on immediate needs in the neighborhood.‚Äù <br><br><h4>  New distribution and revenue model </h4><br>  Suitable for: media major cities and niche publications <br><br>  New distribution models will offer media new ways to make money in the near future.  Some newspapers have already opened an API to access their content and databases. <br>  Reverse syndication allows journalists to earn money regardless of links and clicks.  Politico.com has created a network in which members can publish their articles, and advertising is attached to them.  Then network members receive their percentage depending on the amount of impressions that their materials attracted.  Such a scheme is likely to work better on a national scale, but if you make a special framework for it, it will be effective for the media of large cities and for niche publications. <br>  You should also pay attention to the possibility of creating embedded newspapers provided by <a href="http://www.apture.com/">Apture</a> and <a href="http://www.observer.com/2009/media/google-launches-web-elements-and-times-all-over-it">Google Web Elements</a> . <br><br><h4>  Gift cards </h4><br>  Suitable for: media major cities <br><br>  A somewhat mysterious system in which media of the <a href="http://www.timesleader.com/features">Times-Leader type</a> sells advertising in exchange for gift certificates.  Then the reader buys these certificates for half the price from the media.  All remain with the fat. <br><br>  ================================== <br><br>  Who cares, look here again these publications and translations: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/mass_media/56516/">21st century media.</a>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/mass_media/56516/">Part 5.
