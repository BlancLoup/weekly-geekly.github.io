Who cares - welcome under cat. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Immediately upset - HD2 is the one that you really want to talk about, it's interesting to write and in general you can tell a lot of things - so the review will be in two parts.  Despite the huge number of new products that have appeared in the last month or two, the HTC HD2 is still not losing ground and for many remains the object of close attention.  If you do one review, it will be either ‚Äúempty‚Äù or so big that no one will master it ... Therefore, the first part will be about the piece of metal itself, and the second part will tell you about the stuffing - so that everything falls into place.

Well, the last thing - if you have any questions - ask me or look for answers in other reviews that are not on the Internet for the first day. <br><br><h2>  Intro </h2><br>  The HTC HD2, also known as the HTC Leo, is a model that went onto the mainstream market this fall.  Despite the fact that now most manufacturers have focused on Android, HTC decided to release the flagship on the good old Windows Mobile, version 6.5. <br><br>  The novelty is unequivocally interesting - there has never been such a productive filling in such a thin case.  Yes, and the screen size in 4.3 '' is probably the first time (at least on the mass market). <br><br>  TTX novelties are as follows: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1e6/351/f31/1e6351f31799871f4e55a0718239fcac.png" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  Go-go-go! </h2><br>  The box is the same as the HTC Hero - a small brick made of thick cardboard that fits easily in one hand.  At first, this causes some joy - beautiful, minimalist ... but subconsciously you quickly realize that there was definitely no space inside for velcro accessories for mounting into a car.  I bought the same HTC P3300 in the maximum configuration - which wasn‚Äôt there ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6bd/fcf/2cc/6bdfcf2cc349e1d47ad824ea1ccb0b9e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Inside the device is securely mounted on a special substrate, under which is everything else.  Namely: <br><br>  - Case; <br>  - USB wire; <br>  - Battery; <br>  - Memory card; <br>  - Wired stereo headset; <br>  - Adapter for charging; <br>  - Quick Start Guide. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c05/814/91a/c0581491a8150fb4658217d936b62d3d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>The quick start guide is</b> subtle and black and white - only the highlights are spelled out.  On the one hand, this phone is unlikely to be bought by a person who is far from technology - there should be no problems in mastering the problems.  On the other hand, to any technically complex device there should be a detailed description, moreover, in paper form - so that without having a computer at hand, one could know everything and everyone. <br>  <b>The adapter</b> has a removable plug - apparently, in order to make it easier to lose one of the parts;) (in fact, this is done so as not to produce adapters - you can simply change the plug depending on the region).  There is no wire from the adapter - there is only a USB-connector in which you need to insert a USB-cord.  In general, not the most versatile option, however, you can charge. <br>  <b>The wire</b> from the USB-microUSB kit ‚Äî something that upset me a little too.  Why the company left miniUSB, which is much more versatile and was previously unclear in most models.  For example, now in the span there is an auto-charging from the P3300 kit, not to mention the fact that now you need to carry 1 more cord.  And in case of loss of the wire, the wire with microUSB will still have to be searched ... and in terms of reliability it does not cause me any confidence, somehow everything is as good.  You can certainly buy an adapter microUSB-miniUSB, but IMHO, it should be included.  Nevertheless, everything has been working fine for a month already, although a small residue has remained. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/46d/b0d/59f/46db0d59f76aa7c0327718a128c30f10.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>A</b> 2GB microSD <b>memory</b> card from SanDisk contains Navitel navigation software, comes with an adapter to a regular SD card. <br>  <b>Battery</b> - 1230 mAh, 3.7V, 4.55Wh. <br>  <b>The headset is the</b> most common - black glossy earbuds, on the wire which is a small remote (to control music, receive calls).  Even despite the removable clip - they are hardly anything better than headphones from an iPhone), so I immediately put them back in the box. <br>  <b>A case</b> of young dermantine leather)) In fact, the case is very good - it is dark gray in color and has a yellow line around the perimeter, and inside - a fleecy cover so as not to scratch the phone.  But initially it is sooo tight.  So much so that getting the phone out of it was a problem) After a week of active wear, the situation improved - the cover was a little spread, I additionally stretched it under the hairdryer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4e1/b01/263/4e1b01263b487bc5a6748466dced3925.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Actually, everything.  But the most terrible (for myself) I learned a little later - at the time of purchase, there were no original accessories in Russia anywhere) More precisely, of course something started to hurt - films on the screen (500r), self-made silicone silicone cases (500r) or even from crocodile skin (3000r), but it was all ‚Äúnot right‚Äù (although I bought a non-original case with a ‚Äútongue‚Äù).  Everyone is waiting for the original supply - they promise in January-February (although something can already be found on the internet).  In general, while with high-quality accessories tugovato) <br><br><h2>  Kind outside </h2><br>  Usually I take pictures of the devices immediately after the ‚Äúopening‚Äù - as long as there are no prints, dust particles and other misfortunes on them - yet, in the photos it looks more advantageous and more pleasant.  But here the willpower was simply not enough) Yes, and the people in the office could not be stopped - even the owners of Hero (whom in the office at that time were already three) put everything off in order to slap the new small screen) <br>  Nevertheless, everything turned out to be much more optimistic - the device is extremely resistant to external stimuli and here's why. <br>  Almost the entire front part is occupied by a capacitive screen, the diagonal of which is an honest 4.3 inches (resolution 480x800, WVGA, 88x56 mm) - it is reliably protected by a layer of glass. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e66/51c/d57/e6651cd57053a1571dedbc0cea475224.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It would seem that in the device can be made of materials more defenseless than glass?  However, field trials showed quite the opposite.  Take a look at this video (see HD version): <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/nPPpWz66TUo%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgAymWTzd62CINxyap-LxseZ2lhxA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  It is logical to assume that a knife with a diamond sharpening will do its job) But in my whole life, for example, I have never had a chance to walk with a similar knife and phone in one pocket.  The screen is more than resistant to attack - scratching it did not work out even intentionally ... and since it takes up almost all the space, the communicator will still look "new" for a long time, even if you just carry it in your pocket.  Not to mention the case ... <br>  The glass is quite brandy - prints easily remain ... but they are also easily erased - by hand, sleeve, or on the leg). The frame is almost absent - for greater convenience when controlling with your fingers.  Everything is clearly visible in the sun on the screen - this is rare.  Auto brightness control knows its business. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/715/b4c/7e2/715b4c7e2211465283c69f2140300cc4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  ‚Äú <b>And what are these points and stripes on the screen ?!</b>  "- there was a question from the audience)) Perhaps, this is one of the most frequent questions that are generally asked about this communicator. <br>  Indeed, the screen is covered with many ‚Äúartifacts‚Äù, among which are diagonal strokes with an interval of approximately 5 mm (and since the strokes are at two angles, they eventually form a grid) and two types of points ‚Äî one at the intersection of the strokes, the second with intervals about 2 mm (these were still on the P3300).  Why all this ‚Äúdisgrace‚Äù is needed - I don‚Äôt know, but it is visible only when a bright light hits the screen (solar or reflection from a lamp).  In everyday use, they are almost invisible and DO NOT interfere.  I tried to convey everything in the photographs (by the way, it is these points and grids, as well as the villi from the plush ball that create on the video above the appearance that the screen has been scratched). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/15f/122/7c1/15f1227c1511f0c8c4204dec08cb8290.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/953/441/8ec/9534418ecb48b7e7738a370fb5bfc9b2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In general, for the practicality of the screen I put 6 points out of five.  However, as for the quality of the picture, but more on that later. <br><br>  Above the screen there is an ‚Äúear‚Äù sensor, a light sensor and a fine speaker grid - below it there are also functional LEDs.  Below the display there are 5 buttons - in relief, they are divided into 4 buttons, but in fact this is all one big detail that just bends under your fingers.  Because of this, it is minimal backlash, but there is no discomfort. <br><br>  The reverse side is also interesting - in the middle about 60% is occupied by a metal battery cover (with fine polishing texture), and above and below there is a soft plastic-tach type plastic (the rest of the body is made from it).  Above the lid there is a rather prominent protrusion of a five-megapixel camera (to some extent it is even <a href="">sharp</a> ), a dual LED flash and a speaker grid (for statistics, 22 holes). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/97d/322/e43/97d322e433be0bac2495ccbe24902959.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The lid is removed very tightly, but you can catch it;) But it is encouraging that nothing will be erased there ... and the lid will be firmly fixed all the time.  Under it is a battery, a slot for a microSD card and a SIM card slot.  As well as the red "point" to restart.  A memory card and SIM card can be changed without removing the battery - this is a plus.  But the fact that the Reset is hidden in a place inaccessible to the pin is perhaps a minus (although the phone has never hung up all the time). <br><br>  There is nothing above and to the right, but on the left side there is a ‚Äúrocker‚Äù for volume control.  Bottom - a microphone, headset jack and microUSB-hole. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f5a/a14/024/f5aa1402422708cc55fd761824afb17f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The design of the device is really pleasant, at least with such a screen it would be difficult to come up with something else.  It happens, you use the device, having closed eyes on its appearance ... here everything suits me absolutely.  No glamorous chrome inserts, extra decor - nothing!  Not even gloss!  Hooray! <br><br>  The dimensions of the device are (in mm) 67x121x11 and the weight is 157 grams - very worthy.  This is the largest of the communicators (and the thinnest) that I have ever seen - even a little bit and it would be inconvenient to hold it in my hand ... but this model is still ‚Äúon the verge‚Äù - a day later I got used to its size. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1b7/177/851/1b71778511ff0f0c3afc1ef28c9a6235.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Speaker volume is good - you definitely will not miss the call.  But listening to music through it is a pleasure from dubious, it is much better to use headphones.  Vibrating alert is strong - it is felt even in the case of the inside pocket of the thick winter down jacket (true). <br><br>  Opening hours - in standby mode, the phone may well lie for two days, or even more.  With my own pace of use, it lasts exactly a day.  ‚ÄúMy pace‚Äù is the auto brightness control of the screen, about an hour of conversation per day, 10 photos per camera, a couple of hours in ICQ (here with minimal backlight), and 30 minutes of twitter, opera, navigation and playing Teeter. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/dfc/d43/8a3/dfcd438a3e5e04109c09c6fdeafd2414.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In the case of watching a video or listening to music, the device lives even less, but fortunately, these functions are delegated to me by the profile devices. I'll write about the video playback separately in the second part. <br><br>  The communicator connects to the computer without any firewood, the speed of work through the cord is as follows: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/277/385/9d6/2773859d644ba759cfcfd0f7a1f2e307.png" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  to be honest </h2><br>  In the first part I will not summarize, list the pros and cons - I will only list a couple of points that I (personally) liked (without going into the program details). <br><br>  <b><u>Liked</u> :</b> <br>  (* - norms, *** - super) <br><br>  ** Thin, stylish, youth; <br>  *** Just a damn huge screen !!!  Its color and vitality; <br>  *** Metal and matte plastic - the body is simply superb!  It is also convenient to hold it in your hand; <br>  *** High performance, I have all the wireless interfaces I need; <br>  ** Copes with unconverted video; <br>  ** Memory card support; <br>  ** WM - this is a plus for me; <br>  * The camera makes a generally good pictures; <br><br>  Pleasantly pleased with the practicality of the case - the back side of the same Hero is scratched with a fingernail without problems, not to mention the glossy cover of the phone.  Android may be good, but I didn‚Äôt ask anyone - no one told me a single obvious advantage, because of which it would be possible for me to run at breakne head speed to change the device and OS.  But for a couple of years I got used to WM - I decided on the software, I know where, what and how ... and what is most surprising - I am perfectly working with all this. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1b5/d56/ca3/1b5d56ca356bac64edcc78a614733f62.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  By the way about oyfon) He has everything - from single-celled blondes to gopniki - at least because of this pop of his I don‚Äôt want him (although I agree that he is not bad at all else).  And if earlier ‚ÄúiPhone killers‚Äù had to make only miserable attempts, here ... I will not say that the iPhone was killed - this can be said in the second part of the review)) But this device is at least not ashamed to get out of your pocket ... and, as shown practice, the owners of iPhones unwittingly break away from their screens and start to think in a perplexed way, something like ‚ÄúI have <i>n‚Äôt smelled it ... and what is this awesome thing?‚Äù</i>  "And trying in vain to" catch "a glance for the apple logo on the case - for scrolling, hoping to make sure that this is still Apple and that at home it will definitely find info about the new iPhone) And yet, I hope, there will not be any holivars in the cabs I think everyone is tired of it. <br><br>  <b><u>Did not like</u> :</b> <br>  (* - garbage, *** - very bad) <br><br>  * Some kosyachki in the configuration, the lack of currently original accessories; <br>  ** MicroUSB instead of miniUSB; <br>  * On the back of the camera bulges hard enough, its protrusion is somewhat sharp; <br>  * Tightly removed battery cover, hidden reset; <br>  *** A small battery life (day).  Although for such a screen ... <br>  *** The ‚Äútenacity‚Äù of the camera does not allow to shoot more dynamically than the scene or in motion - 4 frames out of 5 are blurry; <br>  * The sound of the speaker is clearly not enough bass; <br>  * <s>Almost always after turning on the phone asks you to specify the desired time zone - enough!</s>  <s>) It was</s> <a href="http://4pda.ru/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D144008%26st%3D140%26p%3D3514871%26">decided</a> <br>  * I will miss the screen off button at the top on the right side; <br>  * Extremely sensitive screen; <br>  ** Price. <br><br>  To break the display on such a device (and, in general, somehow to quest it) hardly anyone wants - I strongly recommend wearing it in a case, with it there are more chances to survive.  Accessories still have to appear - most of all I expect high-quality velcro to the car, the cradle on the table and the stylus (there are times when it would be convenient with it). <br>  The battery life is dictated by a powerful processor and a hefty screen - this is expected and must be borne in mind when buying. <br>  The camera ... was surprised - waited for the best (the same Samsung Jet fotkal is much faster).  I hope to fix them with some patches, but I‚Äôll tell you about the second part ... Speaker - it‚Äôs great for calls (although I use vibrating alert 99% of the time), and listening to music is much better through headphones), so the speaker eat and fine.  Everything else is essentially trivial. <br>  The sensitivity of the screen can be reduced programmatically, but in general, all the discomfort in me, in fact, is caused by the fact that I previously printed mainly on a resistive screen - the difference is significant and requires re-learning. <br>  The price is now from 25 to 30 thousand ... considering that this is a new flagship, it cannot be cheap by definition.  And considering that it is, in fact, image-based - it is assumed that Central Asian babos should be even in times of crisis) And yet, of course expensive. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1ee/c8a/6f1/1eec8a6f1175e558de0fe959d35881e2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  To be continue </h2><br>  The second part is almost ready - I plan to publish it in the very near future.  If the device is interesting, but did not see the answer to the interesting question in the first part or have any suggestions - write, I will try to include everything in the second part of the review.  In addition, I can advise a thread on the forum w3bsit3-dns.com, where there are answers, probably, to any questions. <br><br>  <b>* UPD *</b> At the request of workers - the <b><a href="http://bit.ly/7ABiuL">soundtrack</a></b> to the video <br><br>  <b>Successes!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/80508/">https://habr.com/ru/post/80508/</a></p>
