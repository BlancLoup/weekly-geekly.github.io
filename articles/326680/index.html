One of these technologies is the blockchain, which can be used far not only for financial transactions.  Dubai is likely to become the first city in the world, whose infrastructure will be managed on the basis of the blockchain. <br><br>  According to representatives of Dubai, the blockchain with the above purpose can be used next year.  El Kaissi, a representative of the <a href="http://www.smartdubai.ae/">Dubai Smart Government</a> organization, stated that if over the next few years, 10-15 tasks can be solved with the help of the blockchain, this will be a breakthrough.  What challenges does Dubai hope to solve? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  First of all, it is management of all state document circulation.  The fact that this will be done in the near future, Dubai's crown prince Hamdan ibn Mohammed Al Maktoum said at the end of last year.  Now the initial plan began to implement.  ‚ÄúThe emirate is constantly working on an important task - to grasp the future and keep up with the fourth industrial revolution with the prospects of increasing efficiency,‚Äù the prince said.

      Dubai names real estate, banking, healthcare, transportation, urban construction, energy infrastructure, e-commerce and tourism among the areas of activity that can take advantage of the blockchain.  Plus, the created platform will be open for other regions. <br><br>  The technology of the blockchain, despite its prospects for the economy, is only at the very beginning of its technological cycle.  Bitcoin is the first and most famous application of this technology.  Now the blockchain exists separately from Bitcoin, various companies and private developers are creating more and more new technologies based on the blockchain.  IBM supports it and tries to develop this technology using all available methods. <br><br>  Thanks to this system, all human economic activity can be rebuilt.  Many people find it difficult to think about this technology without being tied to Bitcoin, but as other areas of use of the blockchain appear, the situation changes.  Interestingly, the sphere of financial services is only one of the niche scenarios for the blockchain, in fact, the possibilities of this technology are much wider.  As an example, we can cite several cases of work with the blockchain of modern companies without being tied to finance and Bitcoin. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b86/73e/8c6/b8673e8c68914858afcfbc13a8b9d358.jpg"><br><br>  The blockchain does not need the participation of any central authority.  Due to this, the system remains stable and self-regulating.  In addition, a big plus blockchain is that it is one of the most low-cost ways to market for any of the companies.  You can send both physical and digital assets without centralized management. <br><br>  As mentioned above, the project will be implemented by the Dubai Smart Government.  This organization will be able to provide participating startups and providers with different services based on the blockchain.  In addition to IBM, the company Consen Sys will take part in this project.  Thanks to the joint work with IBM and other partners, the Dubai municipal authorities will have the opportunity to work with the blockchain to implement other projects in the field of the Internet of things, in the medical and transport fields. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/326680/">https://habr.com/ru/post/326680/</a></p>
