The audience of online broadcasts is growing every year.  During the championship, I occasionally looked at thematic resources, and in this material I will share my impressions of what I saw.  Broadcast championat.ru, liveresult.ru, sports.ru, 08euro.ru, euro2008.lenta.ru got into the review. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  I'll start with the brainchild of the newspaper.ru.  <a href="http://08euro.ru/">08euro.ru</a> turned out to be the most ‚Äúanti-socially active‚Äù - there is no place for UGC.  The user on the page online can get acquainted with the composition of the teams and the arrangement of players on the field.  I would like to mention the creativity of designers - the players are marked with blue and red bars.  Bars reminded me of charts in Excel.  I agree, the pole is ideally suited to designate Roman Shirokov in a match with the Spaniards, but not quite suitable for designating the same Torres.  Online tape is updated on average every 2 minutes.  Goals are often accompanied not only by a brief description, but also by a photo.  Recording Example: <em>50 'GOL!</em>  <em>The Spaniards conducted an attack - Iniesta shot into the penalty area, where Xavi from the central zone struck irresistible ...</em> <br><br>  Broadcast <a href="http://liveresult.ru/">liveresult.ru</a> not much different from the above.  Is that the update rate is slightly higher, an average of 1 entry per minute.  The description of the same goal looks like this: <em>GO-OO-OO-OO!</em>  <em>0: 1!</em>  <em>Xavi!</em>  <em>Slept through our defenders.</em>  <em>Iniesta on the left flank beat Anyukov, and then made a pitch on the goalkeeper's line, and Xavi shot Akinfeev in touch at close range.</em>

      Broadcast <a href="http://championat.ru/">championat.ru</a> stands out by the presence of a user comments feed.  At the end of the match there are football scores and brief statistics on the amount of shots, corners, offside.  Example: <em>Iniesta fiddled with the ball for a long time, shoots along the gate, and Xavi knocks the ball into the net.</em> <em><br></em> <br>  At first glance, the <a href="http://sports.ru/">brainchild of sports.ru</a> seems perfect.  Here you will find both a broadcast tape, and a commentary of ordinary users, and pre-match quotes of bookmakers, and detailed statistics.  I would especially like to note the excellent implementation of the statistics of strikes: the authors provide a full ‚Äúdrawing‚Äù of strikes per match.  Thanks to this, it is possible to learn not only that for the entire match Germany-Turkey, the Germans struck 3 shots on target, but also to make sure that only 4 of all German strikes were made from the penalty area.  Pros sports.ru noted, I will go over the minuses.  The main stream is terrible!  Somehow belatedly turn on the TV, they take away the Romanian football player with a bandage on his face.  I find out the information on the online broadcast, but nothing happened there.  After some time, dry replacement information.  Well, okay, we missed the moment, were too lazy to write or something else, but how can I write this: <br>  <em>22 'Foul.</em>  <em>Villa breaks the rules.</em>  <em>Anyukov suffered.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>21 'Foul.</em>  <em>Senna is breaking the rules.</em>  <em>Semak suffered.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>19 'Foul.</em>  <em>Senna is breaking the rules.</em>  <em>Saenko suffered.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>17 'Foul.</em>  <em>Semshov violates the rules.</em>  <em>Senna suffered.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>16 'Shot.</em>  <em>Pavlyuchenko beats.</em>  <em>The ball flies by.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>15 'Foul.</em>  <em>Puyol breaks the rules.</em>  <em>Arshavin suffered.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>15 'Foul.</em>  <em>Torres is breaking the rules.</em>  <em>Ignashevich suffered.</em> <br>  Excellent description of 7 minutes of the match.  5 points bot and 2 points if it is a person. <br><br>  Translation <a href="http://ru.euro2008.uefa.com/">ru.euro2008.uefa.com</a> performed on a solid 11 points on a ten-point scale.  It becomes immediately clear where other resources draw information from.  Everything is there: the statistics of strikes, violations, possession of the ball, the run of each player and the whole team.  Information is well structured, usability at the highest level.  I have no words! <br><br>  <a href="http://euro2008.lenta.ru/">Euro2008.lenta.ru</a> broadcasts differ from the aforementioned ones by the presentation style.  The tape team is packed up before the match with beer and acts according to the principle: ‚ÄúWhat I see, about that and I sing.‚Äù It turns out not just a goblin translation of the match, but <a href="http://nl.livejournal.com/729055.html">an excellent broadcast in the stembe key</a> for people who want to catch the spirit of the match through the Internet, and not just a dry statement of facts.  In Melnikova and Polivanov‚Äôs warmed-up beer, the comments are very emotional: <br>  <em>56 'GOOOL!</em>  <em>Kovalchuk!</em>  <em>Yo-yo-yo!</em>  <em>Pavlyuchenko!</em>  <em>Fuck, sorry.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>56 'Arshavin gave to Semak, he hung, Pavlyuchenko with one foot touch - at the gate.</em>  <em>This is GOOOOOOL!</em>  <em>Some swear words in my head.</em>  <em>Sorry again.</em> <br>  With the statistics on the tape did not particularly bother.  There are teams, goals, replacements and deletions.  For gamblers, there are bookmakers' quotes on the outcome of the match and on winning the championship of playing teams.  It was especially interesting to observe the change in the coefficients in matches with the participation of the Turkish team.  The disadvantages of this project I would consider the need to manually update the page.  Before the match, the authors honestly warn readers about this: <br>  <em>22:08 'The principle of updating our online: "F5 without Ctrl - like tequila without beer."</em>  <em>That is, it makes no sense.</em>  <em>That is, you need Ctrl + F5.</em> <br><br>  PS In the last paragraph I wanted to summarize the review, but instead I would advise football fans to turn on the TV and forget about the computer for a few hours. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/287518/">https://habr.com/ru/post/287518/</a></p>
