Namely, what price a person pays for his success.  The IT field has an increased interest in this topic.  Since, even being at home, a person works on a computer deleted.  You can spend all your time on work, on promoting your brand, service, but your family thinks about it differently. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e6f/4dc/c3c/e6f4dcc3c7a83cd0e425b95a2ddac174.jpg"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The scheme of work of an ordinary person looks like this: Work-Home-Weekend-Vacation-Work.  Thus, a person divides his activities and spends a lot of time with his family.  He can always count on weekends and holidays, when all his time will belong only to him.

      Scheme of work of a manager / entrepreneur looks like: Work-House (preparation and collection of information) - Weekends (holding meetings) - Vacation (problem of delegation of authority) - Work.  As you can see, a person has less free time, as he needs to prepare all the information and make operational changes to his work. <br><br>  As for a specialist in the field of IT, very often he needs to be online almost 24/7.  Wherever he is, he always has access to work information.  Of course, it is not always possible to work as productively as in the office, but it is possible. <br><br>  As a result, many specialists in the field of IT, there comes a time when he can not do nothing.  Even when he is resting, he thinks about something useful. <br><br>  When I came to an interview at a local ISP company, I ran into two very strange people, then they seemed strange to me.  Now I understand that many behave about as well. <br>  Telecommunications Specialist.  A very funny man, who besides being able to find a common language with any client, also plays great in World of Warcraft.  It is a pity that his wife left him and took the children.  According to him, his wife was annoyed that she could talk to him only by calling the help desk. <br><br>  Well, and then I was struck by the phrase: "Yesterday, during sex, with my girlfriend, I thought that we need to pave new ways."  This not normal.  Well, when a person takes a shower and thinks about the meaning of life, but not so much. <br><br>  High dedication, ability to work remotely turn IT specialists into people who no longer care about anything other than numbers.  And this trend is really scary. <br><br>  Most companies have a cafe, fitness rooms and other items in their offices.  But they do this so that the person will be longer at work and think about work all the time. <br><br>  I would like to know how you can find a balance between work and home.  And what does your girlfriend / wife think about your job? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/147201/">https://habr.com/ru/post/147201/</a></p>
