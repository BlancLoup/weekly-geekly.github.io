We traditionally see off the winter and meet the spring with the online stage of the hacker competition!  The online stage NeoQUEST 2016 will take place <b>from March</b> 11-21. <br><br>  At the end of the online stage, the best participants will be selected, who will be invited to St. Petersburg for the summer confrontation, giving them the opportunity to win cool prizes and a trip to one of the international conferences on cybersecurity!  More about the topics and tasks NeoQUEST-2016 - under the cut! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  <b>For those who first hear about NeoQUEST</b> </h4><br>  NeoQUEST is an annual cybersecurity competition for individual participants, conducted in two stages: the online stage and the face-to-face stage (often referred to as the ‚Äúface-to-face‚Äù). <br><br>  As part of the online stage, anyone can register on the event website and complete tasks posted there, combined by an interesting legend.  All tasks have a different level of complexity, some of them are able to pass even to beginners in cybersecurity.  The main thing is savvy and attentiveness!  In accordance with the dynamic scale, points are awarded for each task completed.  The more participants passed the task, the less points will be awarded for it, and vice versa.  Also, the earlier the participant passed the task - the more points he gets!  All those who have completed at least one task are expected to receive small prizes from the NeoQUEST team!

      And the best of the best, in addition to the prizes, also receive an invitation as a participant in the hackquest for the summer ‚Äúconfrontation‚Äù in St. Petersburg, where they will have 8 hours to meet with their rivals in the online stage in reality and fight for the main prize - a trip to one of the international cyber security conferences! <br><br>  Those who are not among the best at the end of the online stage should not despair - as long as participants go through the hackquest, everyone can enjoy a vivid event, including: <br><ul><li>  interesting reports from information security practices; </li><li>  exciting and fun contests; </li><li>  online quiz on <a href="https://twitter.com/NeoquestSupport">Twitter NeoQUEST</a> "USE"; </li><li>  workshops on cybersecurity (for example, at the on-site stage NeoQUEST-2014 a cold-boot attack was demonstrated using liquid nitrogen, you can see the photos <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/neobit/blog/230579/">here</a> ). </li></ul><br>  At the end of the evening, the results of the competition are summed up: the hackquest winners are awarded with gifts, the winner of the "Examination on Unified Security System" is announced. <br><br><h4>  <b>And now - to NeoQUEST-2016!</b> </h4><br>  This year, NeoQUEST-2016 is dedicated to the confrontation between the police and the mafia, and each participant can choose the side that he likes the most!  Each side has its own legend, its own goals and its own path to the "ruling elite".  Only tasks remain to be united - fascinating, different in the level of complexity. <br><br>  Speaking of tasks!  Attentive participants will be rewarded - an additional task will open to them, not at all difficult, however, the additional points received for it can be decisive! <br><br>  What else awaits the mafia / police? <br><ul><li>  chess game: who is ready to beat the bot, making a "knight's move" in memory? </li><li>  a virtual Schr√∂der that destroyed an important document </li><li>  green men, without whom no NeoQUEST can do: play with them into the game and outwit them when they try to crush you with quantity! </li><li>  Do you speak ******?  Or work with atypical language queries to data. </li><li>  What is the standoff between the mafia and the police without a crazy chase?  See if you can keep up with the enemy!  Or maybe they will chase you?  In any case, squeeze the maximum out of this car! </li></ul><br>  As well as unconventional ways to use computer components, bitter " <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor">onion</a> " tears and much more! <br><br>  Tasks, as always, can be completed in any order. <br>  In addition to the prizes, the best participants of NeoQUEST rely on the ‚Äúeducational‚Äù bonus: their success in the competition is taken into account when they enroll in the magistracy and graduate school at the ‚ÄúCyber ‚Äã‚ÄãSecurity‚Äù department of the St. Petersburg Polytechnic University! <br><br><h4>  <b>Time to choose your side</b> </h4><br>  For all questions related to NeoQUEST, write to support@neoquest.ru.  It is also recommended to write there when you have questions about the tasks! <br><br>  All the time that the online stage lasts, Twitter publishes news about how successful participants are, who takes the leading position, and how many points others are behind the leader.  In addition to Twitter, you can find out the latest news on the <a href="http://neoquest.ru/">official</a> NeoQUEST <a href="http://neoquest.ru/">website</a> . <br><br>  So who are you  Dexterous and cunning fraudster, a representative of the street mafia, who will stop at nothing, just to clean up the thread of one of the first persons of the state?  Or are you a representative of order, an incorruptible guardian of the law, ready to persecute scammers? <br>  It's time to make a decision!  Whose side are you on?  <a href="http://2016.neoquest.ru/">Make your choice</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/277247/">https://habr.com/ru/post/277247/</a></p>
