  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Links from social networks</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Social networks have gradually replaced for many users a large number of different resources, which are why they are considered the most visited resources in the world.  There is no need to visit different sites, when almost all large and medium-sized companies have their own communities in social networks. <br>  Vkontakte is considered the most popular network in Russia, and only after it is Yandex.  Involuntarily think about it, and what percentage of content falls into the index of search engines?  And what percentage of links from social networks is taken into account by search engines?  Links from which social networks Yandex takes into account? <br><br>  Everything is in order. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  As a method of analysis, the links in the panel for webmasters of Yandex were analyzed (large information portals, online stores).  It was prompted by the fact that once these links are displayed here, it means that Yandex somehow takes them into account.  Among the links highlighted only popular social networks, such as: <br>  In contact with, <br>  Facebook, <br>  Twitter, <br>  Google Plus, <br>  YouTube, <br>  Instagram, <br>  Classmates <br>  Pinterest. <br><br>  Favorite in Russia Vkontakte, in the backlinks of Yandex is displayed by the construction vk.com/away.php, which 302 redirect leads to the desired page.  From Vkontakte Yandex displays only the latest added materials.  A large information portal, to which thousands of links from social networks lead, Yandex counts only a little more than 300 links. <br>  Comparing large sites with high traffic with smaller ones, he noted that the time interval in which Yandex considers links varies, there is probably a certain limit on links from social networks.

      Links from Facebook are not displayed in the Yandex webmaster‚Äôs panel; however, when I started working with the table in Excel, I found downloaded links from Facebook. <br>  Again, a large information portal that actively maintains a page on Facebook has several working links that Yandex took into account. <br><br>  In Twitter for Yandex, retweets from statuses are important, and it can also display some profiles.  Of the 30 references, 20 are profiles, and only 8 are statuses.  For example, I decided to compare the data in the Yandex webmaster panel and in the exported table in Excel - again the number of links is different (in the Excel table it is much less). <br><br>  With Google Plus, the situation is similar to Twitter.  Links are taken into account mainly from personal profiles and communities. <br><br>  The reason for which, in fact, my research was started is the search for the interaction between Yandex search engine and links with YouTube.  After analyzing the information, he noted that Yandex takes into account the links from the description of the video, despite the fact that they are closed in nofollow.  In addition, links from the page of the official channel of the site are taken into account. <br><br>  Instagram does not like unnecessary links and insert a link can only be in the profile.  Yandex takes into account such links and displays them on the webmaster panel and in the exported table. <br><br>  Only one online store from those I analyzed had an account on the Odnoklassniki social network.  But despite the efforts of the owner of the resource to develop on this site, not a single link from this social network was found.  I cannot rely on a single case, so I will observe further. <br><br>  And at the request of our marketer, I checked how Yandex relates to Pinterest.  I was pleasantly surprised that although this social network is not among the most popular (perhaps for now), but the search engine takes back links from it both those that are listed in the user profile and those that are placed along with the pins. <br><br>  Summing up, I‚Äôll note that all social networks, except Vkontakte, close the links in nofollow, but Yandex displays them.  There is a certain regularity (so far there is little data, because the experiment is still ongoing) on ‚Äã‚Äãthe influence of links from social networks on the growth of the site‚Äôs positions. <br><br>  I will definitely note that there is a benefit when promoting a site in using links from Twitter, Pinterest, Google Plus, Vkontakte, Instagram and YouTube.  Unclear efficacy of links from Facebook and Odnoklassniki. <br>  The experiment continues.  Hope the information was helpful. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/294998/">https://habr.com/ru/post/294998/</a></p>
