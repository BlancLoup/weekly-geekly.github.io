In science fiction, the topic of the danger of powerful intelligence, capable of manipulating people or devoid of a specific moral direction, has been very carefully studied.  A smarter, and therefore more powerful bot is a bot that has more opportunities to do evil, simultaneously manifesting the inherent human pride. <br><br>  Of course, all this is fantastic.  But since modern high-tech has <a href="https://howwegettonext.com/what-chatbots-can-teach-us-about-ourselves-1c5d74e523bc">begun to focus on conversational bots</a> (conversational bots), defining them as the future of <b>everything</b> , then perhaps it offers us a way to determine the capabilities of a bot.  In this case, we can say that the <b>bot has ample opportunities if it is able to cause serious harm at will</b> .

Cortana is Microsoft's version of Siri.  She has the same restrictions that prevent her from becoming one of the most powerful bots. <br><br>  Cortana is integrated into the Windows ecosystem and installed by default on all computers with Windows 10. Therefore, the bot has access to all files and configurations on the machine: browser history, your documents, photos, etc.  And when Windows 10 starts to be actively used in the corporate segment, the potential of Cortana will increase even more. <br><br>  <b>Abigail Ronk:</b> <i>‚ÄúToday, this is the only cross-platform voice assistant.</i>  <i>This bot has access to user data on PCs, iPhones and Android devices.</i>  <i>Conveniently?</i>  <i>Of course.</i>  <i>Big brother is watching you?</i>  <i>Perhaps a little.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6a2/4e9/90f/6a24e990f55147e1a8d648171856f2fd.png"><br><br><h1>  <a href="http://viv.ai/">Viv</a> (Viv Labs, 2016) </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6c7/05a/2b8/6c705a2b8c9745769c85c4eec2ec1a0d.jpg"><br><br>  Probably, we should not have included this bot in the rating, because it is not yet available to the public.  Viv was created by the authors of Siri, and its appearance was <a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/08/viv/">accompanied by an incredible sensation</a> . <br><br>  In fact, it is Siri, but without the limitations inherent in the latter.  At the moment, Siri is able to set up notifications in the calendar and look for plane tickets, but does not know how to add this data and book a flight for the relevant date.  The closest thing to this functionality is Google Now, but this bot works only within the Google ecosystem.  Viv, according to the press, will be the first bot to break out of the cage.  We'll see. <br><br>  <b>Roman Yampolsky:</b> <i>‚ÄúToday it is the most intelligent chat bot, with unprecedented capabilities for processing complex designs.</i>  <i>If you customize it, you can use it with malicious intent, for example, to steal personal data. ‚Äù</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b5b/0c5/0ad/b5b0c50adbec4e3a8e4370f4a5d5177e.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/397/751/4c0/3977514c0e6b45a2a6710ae21fb91d71.png"><br><br><h1>  <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-trending-35778645">Iran's Bot Army</a> (Unknown, 2015) </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/46e/c23/4a4/46ec234a495140cbb2d83a0bcf5e35a3.png"><br><br>  This position in the ranking can take any bot-army.  After all, this has to do with the inevitable phenomenon in social media: propaganda. <br><br>  During the decade of active development of social media, we could see that many of the optimistic predictions about their role in public discussion were exaggerated.  It was believed that if the votes of all users are equal, then this will make social media as a whole democratic.  But it seems that the very same tools make it very easy to create crowds of accounts chanting in the interests of their owners. <br><br>  In this case, this chorus is spamming messages through coordinated pro-Iranian propaganda.  But who exactly is responsible for this?  Iranian government?  A lone programmer with a lot of free time?  Today, tools are easily available that allow you to create such bots, and many use it. <br><br>  <b>Ian Steadman:</b> <i>‚ÄúThese bots make all the attempts to analyze and present social media as a mirror of public opinion and discussion into a mockery.</i>  <i>Over time, they can change our perception of public opinion on important issues. ‚Äù</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/244/db1/7c4/244db17c431f4c2b8b7be705a02fe3f5.png"><br><br><h1>  <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/if-your-teacher-sounds-like-a-robot-you-might-be-on-to-something-1462546621">Jill Watson</a> (IBM, 2016) </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4d6/f04/9aa/4d6f049aaa4e44b0995ce6e96774c299.jpg"><br><br>  From January this year, senior IT students at the Georgia Institute of Technology receive help from Jill, an assistant teacher of online courses.  She is always happy to help, and most of the students (who have never met her before) were shocked when they were told in April that Jill was a bot. <br><br>  Jill is based on the IBM Watson deep learning artificial intelligence.  And the development of the bot has not yet been completed - other faculty assistants were asked to communicate with students relatively calmly so that Jill does not stand out against their background.  However, some students noted that she was too cold in correspondence.  In any case, the fact that the bot was entrusted to perform administrative tasks in the field of training is impressive.  Soon he will begin to learn. <br><br>  <b>Roman Yampolsky:</b> <i>‚ÄúThe bot is powerful enough to inspire students to think, especially in the light of the fact that they are students of the course on creating artificial intelligence.</i>  <i>That is, the bot affects future AI research. ‚Äù</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/496/399/ec3/496399ec362c4c2389ae70542c8dcbff.png"><br><br><h1>  <a href="http://hellobarbiefaq.mattel.com/">Hello Barbie</a> (Mattel, 2015) </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7e8/582/215/7e85822156014ae4884dad79f2f5991f.jpg"><br><br>  Children tend to talk with their dolls.  And now they are able to keep up the conversation.  Hello Barbie uses a microphone, speaker, and network connection.  The bot listens to the request, and then responds with cloud computing magic and a voice processor. <br><br>  In short, such as Siri.  But Hello Barbie is notorious for the fact that <a href="http://www.cnet.com/news/hello-headaches-barbie-of-the-internet-age-has-even-more-security-flaws/">at first its connection to the network was unsafe</a> , traffic could be easily intercepted in the form of audio recordings.  Perhaps there was even a way to locate the doll.  So remember these moments when you want to use a chat bot for home use.  And especially if the user is a child who does not understand the possible consequences of talking with his favorite doll. <br><br>  <b>Katina Michael:</b> <i>‚ÄúHello Barbie can be an excellent advertising channel for big brands.</i>  <i>A doll might say something like, ‚ÄúOh, hello, Chelsea.</i>  <i>You are hungry?</i>  <i>How about a healthy breakfast at McDonalds?</i>  <i>I know that Mommy is not at work right now, so you can go and ask her.</i>  <i>Do you remember the last time you told me that you bought a salad and you liked it?</i>  <i>There now is an opportunity to buy a burger, salad and juice for only $ 5.</i>  <i>This is called Happy Mil.</i>  <i>Oh, and remember, you said that mom scolded you a few days ago?</i>  <i>Would you like to talk to me now about this so that you feel better? ‚Äù</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7ea/456/387/7ea456387f0c40c18bc1c479a9ff376c.png"><br><br><h1>  <a href="http://www.apple.com/ios/siri/">Siri</a> (Siri Inc., 2010) </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ad9/54e/237/ad954e23754c40909428fd881520a654.jpg"><br><br>  In a number of moments - this is a role model for modern bots.  Siri was launched by Apple in 2011.  The bot is built into the iOS ecosystem ( <a href="http://9to5mac.com/2016/02/24/apple-siri-osx-10-12-2016/">it is rumored</a> that it will be available in the next version of OS X).  But we still put Siri in the rankings a bit lower than other similar bots, because it still looks a bit primitive. <br><br>  If you ask for the voice of this bot, then it can do impressive things.  For example, he can dictate a message or integrate with smart home devices.  But it is limited only by the Apple ecosystem.  The bot can not coordinate among themselves the various search results, it only gives them in the form of a list.  Siri can tell you that next Friday you are free, and will find the number of a suitable restaurant, but will not be able to add 2 + 2 and reserve a table. <br><br>  <b>Bruce and Sue Wilcox</b> : <i>‚ÄúPeople ask Siri to find a variety of information, and she maintains users' trust in Apple.</i>  <i>Therefore, it can send people in the wrong direction, or lead to infected or phishing sites, or encourage users to provide their credentials.</i>  <i>Or, instead of ordering pizza, place an order for 50 people. ‚Äù</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/072/2a4/58c/0722a458cde94a9ea80ed8421b565198.png"><br><br><h1>  <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/08/facebook-launches-m-new-kind-virtual-assistant/">M</a> (Facebook, 2015) </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8f0/4ce/a77/8f04cea77c5c47de96f96336308f4814.jpg"><br><br>  The idea is that you can solve problems like buying tickets or agreeing dates with friends by sending only messages.  In the end, the bot "M" will be integrated with all other bots.  That is, if you ask the bot to order a taxi, then he will communicate with the bot of the taxi company and place an order. <br><br>  "M" can get access to a huge array of information about users.  So the built-in limitations of its capabilities acquire a special role. <br><br>  <b>Olivia Solon:</b> <i>‚ÄúIf‚Äú M ‚Äùdecides to become an outcast, then it will not be James Bond's sidekick, but the villain from Bond.</i>  <i>A bot can tell your unrequited love that you are staring at his / her page;</i>  <i>when you are especially sad, a bot can re-mark on purpose all those awful photos that you wanted to forget.</i>  <i>Moreover, he can remind Americans to vote for Trump. ‚Äù</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8de/800/ff1/8de800ff1e4149a7940f58545a89a6eb.gif"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/534/023/488/5340234886b74e4992450fe5d74bd591.png"><br><br><h1>  <a href="https://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/">Watson</a> (IBM, 2006) </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/161/ece/fc1/161ecefc1b744461ad1138d270d9e261.jpg"><br><br>  The real heir to the "chess" computer Deep Blue.  Watson is an attempt by IBM to make a machine that thinks like a human being. <br><br>  Initially, it was created to participate in the television game <i>‚ÄúJeopardy!‚Äù</i> , And in 2011 won a victory over the two previous champions.  Watson is an artificial intelligence that speaks ordinary language and has an incredible amount of knowledge.  We included the Jill Watson bot in the rating because of the special influence of this version of Watson on future IT specialists.  But the ‚Äúclean‚Äù version is even more impressive.  A bot can understand human-asked questions and answer with details aggregated from hundreds of millions of pages of content in its databases. <br><br>  Watson is able <a href="https://howwegettonext.com/i-let-ibm-s-robot-chef-tell-me-what-to-cook-for-a-week-d881fc884748">to invent new recipes on the go</a> , mixing the ingredients in a way that a real chef would never have thought of.  ,        ¬´¬ª  : IBM  <a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2016-04/07/ibm-watson-health-cancer-kyu-rhee">      </a>   Watson'         . <br><br> <b> :</b> <i>¬´, Watson ‚Äî     .        ,     ELIZA  1960-.  ,         ,      ,        ¬ª.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/209/a4a/5f7/209a4a5f74f34449bbd23d996b9af6de.png"><br><br><h1> <a href="http://www.poynter.org/2015/how-the-associated-press-is-using-automation-to-rethink-the-way-it-does-news/375931/">Wordsmith</a> (Automated Insights, 2014) </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6f2/0f5/434/6f20f5434c9e4a568d346578f25d8d13.png"><br> <sup><i>      ,   .  ,     ?</i></sup> <br><br>    <a href="https://howwegettonext.com/taming-the-wild-west-of-journobots-d685aa7a12d6">     </a> ,  Associated Press.         , ,   . <br><br> ,     ,     .      ,   ,    Wordsmith      .     :  2013      Twitter- Associated Press           . <br><br> <b> :</b> <i>¬´,      ,    ,        -¬ª.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/965/2c8/bdc/9652c8bdc56c4b06a4f5cba49a14f8e4.png"><br><br><h1> <a href="http://nautil.us/issue/33/attraction/your-next-new-best-friend-might-be-a-robot">Xiaoice</a> (Microsoft, 2014) </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/307/85f/9d4/30785f9d402e48a9a6ab2aa64b8b69c9.png"><br><br>  ,   .
