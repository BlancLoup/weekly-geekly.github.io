Please tell me how much you get per hour? <br>  - Well, actually, 500. Why? <br>  ‚ÄúDad,‚Äù the son looked up at him with very serious eyes.  - Dad, can you borrow me 300? <br>  - You asked only so that I could give you money for some stupid toy?  - he shouted.  - Immediately march to your room and go to bed! .. You can not be such an egotist!  I work all day, I get tired, and you behave yourself so stupidly. <br>  The kid quietly went into his room and closed the door behind him.  And his father continued to stand in the doorway and get angry at his son's requests.  How dare he ask me about his salary, then ask for money? <br>  But after a while he calmed down and began to reason sensibly: Maybe he really needs to buy something very important.  Yes, to hell with them, with three hundred, he's still never even asked me for money.  When he entered the nursery, his son was already in bed. <br><br>  - Are you awake, son?  - he asked. <br>  - No, Dad.  Just lying, - answered the boy. <br>  ‚ÄúI seem to be too rude to you,‚Äù said the father.  - I had a hard day, and I just broke.  Forgive me.  Here, hold the money you asked for. <br>  The boy sat up in bed and smiled. <br>  - Oh, folder, thanks!  He exclaimed happily. <br>  Then he climbed under the pillow and took out some more crumpled banknotes.  His father, seeing that the child already had money, became angry again.  And the kid put all the money together and carefully counted the bills, and then looked at his father again.

      - Why did you ask for money if you already have it?  - grumbled that. <br>  - Because I had not enough.  But now I just have enough, - the child replied. <br>  - Dad, there are exactly five hundred.  Can I buy one hour of your time?  Please come home from work tomorrow, I want you to have dinner with us. <br><br>  taken from <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/vek_rebenka/">http://community.livejournal.com/vek_rebenka/</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/65685/">https://habr.com/ru/post/65685/</a></p>
