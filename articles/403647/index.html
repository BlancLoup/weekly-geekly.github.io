    <h2>  What is the difference between Roboze One and Roboze One + 400? </h2><br><br><h3>  <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/roboze-one.html"><b><u>Roboze one</u></b></a> </h3><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/19d/b8e/856/19db8e8562bb41f097141538b5f44791.JPG"></div><br><br>  <b>Working area:</b> 280220200 mm <br>  <b>Platform heating:</b> up to 100 ¬∞ C <br>  <b>Extrusion temperature:</b> up to 300 ¬∞ C <br>  <b>Resolution:</b> 25 microns <br>  <b>Price:</b> from 499,000 rubles, depending on options and printer modifications. <br><br>  Roboze One - a personal printer with high printing accuracy.  High accuracy and repeatability of movements is achieved due to the rejection of belt drives, which are not in the printer (all drives are gear-rack gears). <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/f54/9a3/f28/f549a3f28175462ab5f6cfdaafd493bd.JPG"></div><br>  The printer's extruder maintains the temperature up to 300 degrees Celsius, the heating of the printing table - up to 100 degrees, which provides a large amount of materials used.  Printing accuracy is 25 microns (0.025 mm), and the size of the print area is 280 x 220 x 200 mm. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/92f/a9f/9bd/92fa9f9bdf0b40668ef8c3ecb5ef3aae.JPG"></div><br>  Galvanized steel chassis, internal components in stainless steel 6082 and AISI 303. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/088/932/653/0889326537fa48eb8f9bbdc2720a216d.JPG"></div><br>  The extruder is made entirely of stainless steel, which increases its lifespan by two and a half times. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/ab1/277/37d/ab127737db604747878d747508c7feab.JPG"></div><br><h3>  <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/3d-printer-robozeone-400.html"><b><u>Roboze One + 400</u></b></a> </h3><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/d7c/4a5/a18/d7c4a5a18b4a478683dc334adf15d78c.JPG"></div><br><br>  <b>Working area:</b> 200x200x200 mm <br>  <b>Platform heating:</b> up to 150 ¬∞ C <br>  <b>Extrusion temperature:</b> up to 400 ¬∞ C <br>  <b>Resolution:</b> 50 microns <br>  <b>Price:</b> from 2 880 000 rubles, depending on the options. <br><br>  Roboze One + 400 - the industrial version of the Roboze One.  Its main difference from the ‚Äúyounger brother‚Äù is the temperature of extruder operation increased to 400 degrees and up to 150 - the printing table, in this connection - the ability to print industrial materials with high viscosity, requiring high temperatures, and create working prototypes of products from them. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/1f3/83b/5de/1f383b5de56a462f83fbe7a7f227da6c.JPG"></div><br>  The model can be completed with two extruders, for printing with two different materials at the same time. <br><br>  The main control is a 3.5 ‚Äùtouch screen. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/851/713/ce9/851713ce9eb2401286bb031786a2a1ca.JPG"></div><br>  Accuracy of printing provides the same concept as in the younger model - untimely rack and gear transmission. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/61c/eac/dfb/61ceacdfbfec443b9a717cd542674da7.JPG"></div><br>  The resolution of the industrial printer, however, is two times less than that of its personal counterpart - only 50 microns.  And the size of the print area is slightly smaller - 200x200x200 mm.  But even with these characteristics, print quality does not disappoint. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/bd9/d03/6c8/bd9d036c8d4c40ebb0b4b9e904868edb.JPG"><br><br><h2>  What is printed? </h2><br>  Roboze printers print any synthetic material used for FDM printing, including especially abrasive and high-temperature extrusion.
