      <b>Appearance and formation</b> <br><br>  The colocation services along with the data centers caused a commercial boom in online business.  Companies without exception mastered the great and mighty Internet, more and more needing places to put their servers.  But creating your own data centers did not always allow finances.  In addition, building a building is only part of the business.  It is much more important to provide suitable conditions for successful and trouble-free operation of the server.  Thus, there was a need for hosters who would undertake the implementation of this daunting task.  Colocation services have become especially popular for online startups, offering young companies affordable hosting that meets their primary needs. <br><br>  The first centers of colocation appeared around the mid-90s.  One of the pioneers among providers was a native of Silicon Valley, Mike Leber.  In 1994, he founded Hurricane Electric, a communications company in his garage, which, together with web hosting services, began to rent out space for servers of other companies.  This idea appealed to consumers and the process gained serious momentum. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4e6/724/3ba/4e67243ba7924120996f6638e188e06b.jpg"><br><br>  Throughout its existence, the colocation has been maintained on the market due to the reliability of the services provided and the reduction of their costs.  Trying to keep up with the times, the providers constantly improved their services.  This is how the ‚Äúnew generation‚Äù collocations arose, which began to support computing with higher density, unify management portals, and connect information technology infrastructures.  The quality of the services provided has improved, allowing organizations to quickly integrate technology systems, data and applications.  The colocation market was actively developing, offering something new and interesting. <br><br>  Modern trends among hosters slightly change the concept of collocation - it is no longer just a commercial and standardized service.  They improve, increase maneuverability, improve the design of data centers, expand management capabilities, modernize data center infrastructure management (DCIM) and create their own portals.  Modular switches are transformed by mounting them in racks and maintaining high performance with low latency.  New services such as corporate network computing are being introduced.  Much and all automated, so that the customer has the opportunity to run, change settings and perform other actions with servers in real time. <br><br>  <b>Cloud and colocation</b> <br><br>  Quite a relevant topic is the interaction of colocations and clouds.  Indeed, the popularity of the latter is constantly growing, which, in turn, may affect the demand for colocation services.  The cloud has a strong place in the field of hosting.  But on the other hand, this is a good incentive for colocation providers to further expand the capabilities of their services. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/265/60e/943/26560e9432ad402e83b1312358dad79b.jpg"><br><br>  Collocations are inferior to cloud technologies in flexibility and scaling, since they have a more complex system of connecting additional services.  To change the package, the client has to change the iron, in some cases, also rent additional racks.  In the cloud, everything can be done in a few clicks.  In addition, the cloud is much more mobile.  The collocation has a geo-referencing, where the data center, there and the server. <br><br>  But the indisputable advantage of colocation to the cloud is reliability.  All the same, cloud services can not boast of such high data integrity.  And for large companies, security is a priority. <br><br>  And yet, one complements the other.  Colocation provides a platform for cloud technologies, ensuring reliable security of customer data.  In the meantime, a cloud independent of a certain territory is rapidly developing and expanding its capabilities. <br><br>  <b>How not to be trapped</b> <br><br>  Given the abundance of offers and the availability of a data center, it is not so easy to choose a suitable provider.  But there are simple rules, following which you can find the most suitable and reliable option. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a5a/cee/40a/a5acee40a48246b19c19ab4e9829165a.png"><br><br>  1. The quality of the Internet <br><br>  Access to equipment should be permanent, and the exchange of information - effective.  Accordingly, the Internet assumes fast and high-quality work without failures.  Therefore, it is important that the data center has several Internet channels, uplinks, uplink redundancy, channel redundancy in power for surges, and good connectivity. <br><br>  2. Geographical location <br><br>  The geographical location of the data center is important.  It is necessary to take into account the climatic conditions, possible problems with electricity, logistics and transport infrastructure.  Remoteness from main highways, unfavorable climate and other ‚Äúcharms‚Äù can spoil the work of the data center. <br><br>  For power supply it is preferable to places with underground highways, rather than suspended ones.  Then the occurrence of problems due to weather conditions will be reduced to a minimum (such as a power failure due to the fault of fallen trees or road accidents). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c17/1c4/cfe/c171c4cfe78d4f938d1fe33e548ec077.jpg"><br><br>  3. Level of conditions <br><br>  The server should not only be in a suitable place, but also provide all the necessary conditions - cooling, favorable microclimate, the right temperature and permissible humidity.  Systems of guaranteed power supply and heat removal are the basis of the data center operation.  Everything serves the safety and good work equipment. <br><br>  It is also a good idea to understand whether the provider is the owner of the data center or rents space from another company.  In the case of the second option, it would be good to find out in advance about the conditions and terms of the lease, so that you do not have to quickly collapse and move to a new place. <br><br>  4. Security <br><br>  The better and more carefully protected the territory of the data center, the higher its security.  But inside must be made a strict account of visits, controlled access to the equipment.  Video surveillance and biometric access system will be a definite plus.  Yes, and such a trifle, as separately protected cabinets that are under lock and key, still looks safer than open racks in a common cage. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a24/e68/5a0/a24e685a0ca14428874ea9c3287a51fb.jpg"><br><br>  5. 24-hour technical support <br><br>  Support should be made around the clock and the only way.  No weekend, holidays, breaks.  Questions and problems arise at different times, regardless of the time of day.  And the reaction time to them is of great importance, one might say, decisive. <br><br>  This also includes the qualification of the staff, whether they are sufficiently competent.  You can assess the level of professionalism of employees by calling them on the hotline or writing in the chat.  The speed and quality of the response will give an overview of the competence of technical support workers. <br><br>  5. Experience provider <br><br>  Solid experience speaks about experience and stability in any industry.  Therefore, a supplier that has long proven itself in the market will cause more trust than just emerging companies.  On the other hand, let the stability of the business and the successful growth start up and deserve respect, but at the same time they do not give 100% guarantees. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0e3/a2a/7ec/0e3a2a7ecd9e40e0a3157ba4b9f607c5.jpg"><br><br>  6. Financial stability <br><br>  Profitability of the company, as a rule, indicates that its customers are satisfied.  Financially sustainable data centers can improve pricing, technical conditions and provide the most modern support.  It is best to choose a consistently profitable hosting provider who did not claim bankruptcy and was not famous for serious staff cuts. <br><br>  7. Universality of business <br><br>  An important point - the main activity of the company.  Simply put, what else does a provider providing colocation services do?  If the company primarily specializes in telephone service or web hosting, the service may be more expensive.  And while there are no guarantees that the quality of services is consistent with the price. <br><br>  8. Power Supply <br><br>  Any data center should be provided with uninterrupted power supply of all equipment - servers, climate devices like cooling systems and the like.  Uninterruptible power supplies must function even in the event of power surges or a temporary power outage.  Therefore, it is important that there is a backup power source.  Modern data centers use a diesel generator that provides operation in the event of a long power outage. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6ab/147/938/6ab147938d314b61baf8fc26130f9a6d.jpg"><br><br>  9. The presence of large customers <br><br>  If reputable and large companies operating around the world have entrusted their servers with data arrays to a particular data center, then most likely it is really reliable.  A hoster who has brand names among his clients inspires confidence. <br><br>  10. Scope of colocation <br><br>  The presence of several data centers in different parts of the world - although not the primary, but still significant criterion for choosing the data center.  At a minimum, he points to the solid financial position of the company.  It means that it has a stronger financial and technological basis, which provides its business with such global opportunities. <br><br>  11. Price issue <br><br>  An important factor in any business.  But here everyone determines his own budget, under which it will be necessary to look for suitable colocation services. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/04a/9fb/aee/04a9fbaeedad4ed58037898feb8c9397.jpg"><br><br>  And something else about what is worth asking the hoster: <br><br>  - if you need to put more than one server, but you don‚Äôt want to rent a part of the cabinet, whether traffic between servers will be considered.  Not only external traffic is taken into account; <br><br>  - whether support is provided for DDoS attacks.  Despite the everyday occurrence of this problem, many providers of such a service are not provided; <br><br>  - what is the cost of electricity.  The monthly payment includes a certain amount of watts (50-100), but as a rule, it is not enough even for a weak server.  Exceeding the limit can unpleasantly surprise with its value; <br><br>  - paid or free remote control services in manual mode.  The cost can be very solid, so this moment is better to clarify immediately. <cut></cut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/270523/">https://habr.com/ru/post/270523/</a></p>
