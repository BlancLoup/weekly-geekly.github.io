Viewing the source helps to find out how technically information about images is collected.  For example, defining a Linux distribution <a href="https://github.com/anchore/anchore/blob/ffbcd64e2384f947d68bf7cb77e8ce719b0a6d6e/anchore/util/resources.py">is</a> trivially running <code>lsb_release</code> .

      It should also be clarified that, since in different repositories of images follow different release cycles, in this study, the authors took into account only the operating system from the last protected release.  For some images ( <code>library/swarm:latest</code> given as an example), it was impossible to determine the OS, since  "Such images are often statically collected binaries and do not require anything beyond this to run." <br><br>  Finally, at the moment only Docker Hub images were analyzed, but in the future we plan to add statistics on the Amazon EC2 Container Registry (Amazon ECR). <br><br><h2>  Used OS </h2><br><h3>  Official images </h3><br>  The clear favorite among distributions used as the base operating systems for official images is <b>Debian</b> , and Alpine and Ubuntu are far behind it: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/3fa/e00/e62/3fae00e6223c48d685d51fafb20fc200.png"><br><br>  How have the preferences for base distributions changed over the last year? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/897/934/16b/89793416bdfe454788facdb7baa9a9a9.png"><br><br>  Of the more or less stable trends, one can only note the gradual growth of Alpine (due to a slight decrease in the popularity of Debian), but it is too early to predict anything based on these data. <br><br>  Which versions of Debian are preferred?  Everything is logical: with the release of 9 "Stretch" (in June), this release began to "take away" a share from the previous release - 8 "Jessie". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/b2f/691/773/b2f691773454431295cfef9e9f78a68f.png"><br><br><h3>  Public images </h3><br>  Official repositories are perhaps the most popular, but in quantitative terms this is only a small part of everything that can be found on the Docker Hub.  Therefore, the images from the community (public) were also analyzed in Anchore, and the results were somewhat different. <br><br>  The most popular distribution is ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/a7d/444/98c/a7d44498c6784b95930b835e554073cb.png"><br><br>  ... yes, again Debian.  However, the difference with Alpine is already minimal.  But if we look at the time perspective, then the leadership was not eternal: at one time, Debian was inferior to both Ubuntu (December '16 ‚Äî January'17), and Alpine (June '17). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/d25/42b/2a3/d2542b2a3d2147abb08f0751357330b7.png"><br><br>  In general, there is a similar tendency: lately, the popularity of Debian has slightly decreased, while in Alpine it has been growing.  The third distribution, Ubuntu, reached its minimum in June, but went up again.  Appearing in the Raspbian distributions rating indicates the community‚Äôs interest in Docker images on the respective devices. <br><br><h2>  Image size </h2><br>  The choice of the base operating system for containers for many is due to the size of the final image: really, why (all other things being equal) drag files into the image that will not be used in it exactly?  Therefore, experts from Anchore included this criterion in their research. <br><br>  It is unlikely that anyone will be surprised that the image of the base OS is minimal in BusyBox and Alpine.  Of the ‚Äúgeneral purpose‚Äù distributions, Debian / Ubuntu and openSUSE occupy a middle position (about 110-120 MB), while Oracle Linux and Fedora (more than 200 MB) are the ‚Äúthickest‚Äù ones. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/6b2/382/dce/6b2382dce3c542278fc7c63f0b49861c.png"><br><br>  What are the size of the final images based on different systems?  It's pretty obvious: ‚Äúon average in the hospital‚Äù the smallest images are based on BusyBox and Alpine, and the largest ones are from CentOS, Ubuntu and Debian.  For obvious reasons, Raspbian shows an excellent indicator.  At the same time, official images, as a rule, are on average much smaller than images from the community.  But it is interesting that Alpine turned out to be the ‚Äúblack sheep‚Äù here, the images from the community based on which are on average less official. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/9da/2de/19b/9da2de19b31e4e7ba79b173bea472f6f.png"><br><br><h2>  PS </h2><br>  Finally, the <a href="https://blog.docker.com/2016/10/introducing-infrakit-an-open-source-toolkit-for-declarative-infrastructure/">statistics of a</a> slightly different kind from last year - about the increase in the number of pull'ov in the Docker Hub against the background of the Docker development stages <i>(to find a newer one, unfortunately, is not possible)</i> : <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/c84/577/a9a/c84577a9a9c84244adf8f6a0ee26dcae.jpg"><br><br>  We use Ubuntu as the base system for our images, and you? <br><br>  <i>PPS Read also in our blog:</i> <br><br><ul><li>  <i>‚Äú <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/flant/blog/324274/">We assemble Docker images for CI / CD quickly and conveniently along with dapp (review and video)</a> ‚Äù.</i> </li><li>  <i>‚Äú <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/flant/blog/326784/">What famous companies use Docker in production and for what?‚Äù</a></i>  <i>"</i> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/337448/">https://habr.com/ru/post/337448/</a></p>
