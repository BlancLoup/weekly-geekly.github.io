Thank you very much, now I will call them. <br>  please tell me how is this possible?  if you don‚Äôt have access to a donut, how can you pick up a domain through another registrar? <br>  17:25 support: Apparently, someone got access. <br>  How it happened - we can not know. <br>  Maybe through the mail. <br>  me: where access? <br>  support: Maybe through correspondence with their support. <br>  17:26 Access to the Directi panel where your domain was registered. <br>  20 minutes. <br>  17:46 I: But who gives this EPP code? <br>  gave the code? <br>  support: As you have already been informed, our panel did not participate. <br>  17:47 I: so write to me at directi.com or at resellerclub.com? <br>  17:48 support: Since the domain was registered through us, you can use support.resellerclub.com <br><br><h6>  I‚Äôve already unsubscribed to the support of the reseller, waiting for their answer.  Checked for viruses - clean.  The mail was open all day and about every new letter I received a notification.  Although, if the transfer of the domain did not go through onet.ru, mail has nothing to do with it. <br><br>  Can you please tell me how to proceed?  After all, if without any passwords, the domain can go nowhere, it becomes scary to live.  Can / should-if nunet.ru assist in this case, are they responsible for the safety of the domains hosted in their panel? <br><br>  PS: Unsubscribed on Habre, because  there is a maximum concentration of IT-literate people.  I really hope for help with advice in this situation. </h6><br><br>  UPD: Today (10/05/09), in the afternoon, I found in my admin panel an ‚Äúescaped‚Äù domain.  Definitely, an error occurred in the directives, which they wrote to me several times during these days while they were solving this problem. <br>  After returning the domain, the tech support directive did not write anything (thanks, even though the domain was returned to the site). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/71244/">https://habr.com/ru/post/71244/</a></p>
