  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Transfer online dating to offline: statistics of a single dating service</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Arguments about how people get acquainted on the Internet.  The observations are supported by statistical data obtained from the admin panel of one regional dating service. <br><br>  I work on a regional Internet portal.  Portal city.  In order to serve the needs of the residents of the megalopolis, it is filled with a variety of services - here you can buy or sell an apartment, rent property, get a new car and get rid of the old one, find out which bank has the most favorable euro rate and place your unexpectedly born puppies bolognese.  In completion of all this diversity in the summer of 2010, we screwed the Dating service to the portal.  Standard service - profiles, photos, the ability to communicate via PM, ratings of the most active and most popular ... <br><br><h4>  Automatic sympathy </h4><br>  A year has passed - the service scored an audience.  With a daily attendance of the portal of 350 thousand people, the service got its 60 thousand unique users per month (Liveinternet data).  Growth has slowed down, there was a desire to somehow cheer the audience ... We thought up to make the option Invite for a date.  The point is that users with a rating of more than 50% (stars are earned by carefully filling out a questionnaire and regular service visits) began to see the “Invite to a date” button on someone else's questionnaires.  Clicking on it, the user automatically invited the attracted individual to meet.  The invitee receives a notification to which he can respond either negatively or positively (of course, after evaluating the counterparty's questionnaire).  If the invitation is accepted, the couple comes to the office of the portal, gets a ticket to some entertainment institution of the city (for example, invitations to the cinema) and goes on a date.  The service developers personally see the results of their work, wipe the tears of emotion and believe that thanks to them there will be fewer single people on the planet.

      I was lucky to be a service moderator for more than two months.  During this time, I watched who, whom and how invites to a date.  I will share some numbers and comments. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  In just 2 months, 1021 appointments were sent.  Most often, the initiators were men, only every 20th invitation was sent by a woman.  Strangely enough, men prefer their peers - in 60% of cases they decide to meet with women of the same age as they are or 1-3 years younger than themselves.  The remaining 40%, respectively, choose girls 4-10 years younger than themselves.  At the same time, women never try to get acquainted with young people who are younger than them. <br><br>  So, over two months, users sent over 1000 invites, of which 636 were left unanswered, 120 invitations were canceled by the initiator - after a lack of reaction, after 3-5 days, people simply got tired of waiting.  98 invitations were rejected.  And between getting an invite and giving it up, as a rule, it took less than a day.  From this we can conclude that the invitees studied the questionnaires, but did not communicate with those who ordered them a date.  That is, the goal of maximizing the automation of the invitation to the meeting was achieved - no personal interaction, a simple assessment of the questionnaire and the decision made.  Dry and without unnecessary emotions. <br><br><h4>  Earthly love </h4><br>  Now for those to whom the option “Invite to a date” still helped to meet.  The prevailing couples turned out to be 264. The average age for dating is 28 years.  There is no information about whether these meetings have resulted in something more, unfortunately.  You understand, no one was holding a candle. <br><br>  I would like to make a couple of comments about who is still meeting on the Internet.  One of my friends, having studied the profiles of our service, noticed that there are not enough beautiful girls.  And it is true.  On our service, earthly aunts and earthly uncles get quite familiar with themselves.  Many are over 30, many have a failed marriage and have children.  But people continue to search.  A lot of those who are 40-50 years old.  And they actively use the opportunity to find a couple on the Internet.  And in this regard, our dating service is not quite typical.  But this is understandable.  Traffic-generating on the portal is not the Dating section, but various forums and services described at the beginning of the topic.  That is, the profiles on Dating are filled by people who are not led to a resource by the need to brighten up loneliness, but by some completely different needs.  In this regard, the audience turns out to be very vague, but quite adult and sharpened for long-term relationships, and not one-time meetings.  There are almost no professional gigolos and girls who are shot.  Unfortunately, this data is very difficult to convey to advertisers.  Despite the fact that the portal as a whole is not overcrowded - banner places are booked a year in advance, they reluctantly get into the Dating section.  The main argument is that there are only anxious youngsters hanging out there.  Such a stereotype ... <br><br>  Finally, I want to say that while I moderated this service, my colleagues called me an Internet matchmaker.  There was even a thought to dress me up, giving out a couple of movie tickets, to Cupid.  But my functionality was not limited to the moderation of Dating, so the idea was not implemented ... The wings did not grow. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/129361/">https://habr.com/ru/post/129361/</a></p>
