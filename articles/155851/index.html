  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Digital barrier</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  For a long time I have been trying to understand what the new configuration of the world, which has included the Internet, can lead to.  Cyberspace, being a part of reality, is at the same time a new, alternative reality, because it interacts with the inner world of a person through its senses as fully and comprehensively as real reality can act.  Of course, vision and hearing are predominantly exploited, but soon touch, smell and taste will be connected - and when this happens, each of us will think about how much he needs the offline reality around him.  Why do I need this whole boundless world without the possibility of instantly transferring the ‚Äúassembly point‚Äù to any place?  Do I want to turn my attention to someone who is physically close to me, despite his flaws, while distracting from ideal, perfect digital creatures?  Is a person of interest to me who is not present on the Web brightly and visibly, is he able to take me a little bit, winning the competition for attention with millions of video-tactile-scent interactive broadcasts?  This is the danger I see in the image of the future. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Already, a person who has created a blog for himself on the Net and regularly hosts one gets a significant advantage over a person with the same experience, but without a blog.  First, a virtual anchor point appears: you can regularly learn new things about this person, about his thoughts, about his interests, just by reading a blog.  Secondly, a person travels the world - the point remains.  You can always be in touch - convenient, simple, accessible.  Thirdly, you can communicate: ask questions in the comments, share your thoughts, learn and reason.  A person will know your thoughts and respond - answer questions, agree or argue with you.  Fourthly, the person himself, asking questions in his blog to readers or conducting surveys, will learn, learn new things, get answers.  Fifthly, if the comments are open, a community will be formed - discussions, branches, topics.  Such a pastime lasts for hours and captures, captures, captures ... Welcome - you are on the web.  So, you have less time for reality. <br><br>  But let's see what happens next.  You posted the information, your friends read it, you just keep writing.  Spider search engines scan the Web day and night for new sites and updated old ones.  And now, after a few years (yes, just like that) you become famous and popular, because suddenly you are good at writing (with experience, it‚Äôs better).  Now you have a real (really virtual) community of ‚Äúfriends‚Äù that craves every record of you.  And suddenly it turns out that you wanted to change your occupation or you decided that spending so much time on writing the letters on the screen is too much.  Or you simply cannot spend so much time on the Internet - your eyesight has deteriorated or a child has been born.  And you discover something interesting.  First of all, you already can not delete anything.  What is the point of rubbing your site that you are tired of, make changes to the pages or delete an account from the social network?  In the cache of search engines ALL will be forever.  Secondly, you will be sorry to part with ... this set of little letters, these answers and design, and so on.  You don't even want to delete it all, do you?  Third, you do not want to part with the community.  Why, you have been saving them, your ‚Äúfriends‚Äù for so many years (by the way, who is this ZYZYTUT? I don‚Äôt know. But let it be, he wrote a lot of comments in my journal ...).  They helped you, answered your questions, scolded you and laughed with you - and you want to quit them?  Fourth, you are already so used to solving issues through your blog.  Find a kindergarten for a child through a search engine?  Easier to ask in your blog.  Need an employee?  Ask the blog and take a familiar person (in fact, you just exchanged a dozen comments, but it does not matter).  Fifth, you simply do not know what to do with the vacant time.  From a child you get tired, read reluctantly, go shopping?  Boredom.  Well, how can you not share your mood with readers?  And here is a chain stronger than a steel rope that bound you hand and foot.  Your advantage over a zero-blooded companion is growing, but you have to pay for everything.  Sleepless nights, inflamed eyes and a twisted back at the monitor, voluntarily pumping vital energy into countless kilobytes of comments on forums, in chat rooms and social networks, which you will never remember later, but which will be stored forever. <br><br>  So far, no one who has used the Internet since birth has died of old age, since the Web is only 35 years old (how short!) But during this time she managed to penetrate everywhere.  Our children will be fully covered by the Internet: from birth to death.  He will be everywhere.  And it will change the world of men more than anything else.  Why be able to write, if in all your life you may not have to write a single letter?  Why learn the rules for solving quadratic equations, if there are mobile online services that are always and everywhere with you?  Why know outdated writers Tolstoy and Dostoevsky, if there is Pelevin and Lukyanenko?  Why study at all on paper, pens, textbooks, looking at the board?  All this is already dead, right now.  Webinars and interactive shows are what swiftly replace education.  The non-logistical comrade is already dead: he does not exist.  There is nothing about him on the Internet, he does not conduct his video blog and podcast, and therefore does not attract the attention of customers, employers and investors.  And the money passes by.  While attractive blondes and strong guys, promoted on YouTube, live for your pleasure.  They are invited even on TV, where they teach us to live with you.

      Transparency is progressing: new digital people create services for old pre-digital people, hacking public procurement systems, corruption schemes, offshore capital outflow schemes, kicking sluggish bureaucrats, catching bribe-takers and embezzlers.  But they are neither liberals nor patriots, likewise exposing liars-oppositionists, the fraudulent schemes of NGOs and external control.  They are neither rich nor poor - they have a minimum of property, but a maximum of managerial knowledge that allows them to manage the online users of their own universes.  And this is what I came to: the very future in which we will live depends on them.  If these guys en masse will help us, make our lives more comfortable and more beautiful, teach us knowledge, useful in our lives, and make us the same as they are, then we have a future.  If these guys will guide us around the rat race, control us as slaves, manipulate us and leave us without key management knowledge, then we have no future. <br><br>  This is, in my understanding, the digital barrier.  Which we must overcome ourselves and help others in this.  And once on the other side, try somehow not to confuse the generated image on the retina with a view of the freshly mown meadow in the morning.  Probably the only way to do this in the future will be to mow on your own, spitting on the ineffectiveness of these actions for the global economy and personal well-being and cooled coffee near the constantly sticking Skype. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/155851/">https://habr.com/ru/post/155851/</a></p>
