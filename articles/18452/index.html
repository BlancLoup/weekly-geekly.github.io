  <section class="page js-page"><h1>"Web 4.0, or in the fourth world war will fight with batons"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Once Albert Einstein said: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what will fight in the third world war, but in the fourth world people will fight with batons‚Äù. <br>  I would like to rephrase the scientist according to the same scheme: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what‚Äú Web 3.0 ‚Äùwill look like, but I think that‚Äú Web 4.0 ‚Äùwill be characterized by maximum closeness of social connections and personal data‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>When the Internet appeared</b> , it first of all became a means of <i>connecting</i> people to each other.  Its convenience for the communication of people was unequivocally undeniable (we will omit other praises). <br>  People were <i>connected to</i> each other, but approximately as people hold hands in a dark room: ‚ÄúI know whose palm is in my left hand, whose hand is in my right, but I don‚Äôt know with whom these people are connected with free hands.‚Äù  One can argue a lot about the conventionality of terms, but be that as it may, we take this system as ‚ÄúWeb 1.0‚Äù. <br><br>  Time went on as usual, the Internet also developed.  The desire of people to <i>connect</i> , to find people with common interests and common acquaintances was noticed by people who are sensitive to the structure of the moment.  There are <i>social networks</i> , clearly showing people's <i>connections</i> .  In the dark room they turned on the light - and a lot of surprisingly interesting things turned out to be visible to the eyes not accustomed to bright light: ‚Äúwhat acquaintance is connected with whom, what hands, and who and not only with hands;  but there, in the corner, and not even with your hands. ‚Äù  So there was what is now called "Web 2.0".  &lt;p text-align: justify&gt; Probably, it is difficult to be a futurologist.  Usually, this is quite a thankless task - to predict what is not yet obvious to everyone.  Therefore, I will try, let's say, to dream ... <a name="habracut"></a>

      <b>The evolution of IT-technology</b> does not stand still.  With a certain degree of confidence, the next stage in the development of the Internet can be predicted, namely: those social networks that have been formed and which have not yet come into being will be used to control the behavior of people in offline life.  No, it is unlikely to be like movies in the dystopian genre.  On the Internet, nothing can happen that cannot happen in real life, and vice versa - simply because, in my opinion, there is no separation of reality into ‚Äúreal‚Äù and ‚Äúvirtual‚Äù (I apologize for the tautology). <br><br>  <b>Nothing unusual will happen: it is</b> just that in our room, described in the two examples above, an official, a businessman, and a peace officer will be found.  They will look at us all, read, and each of them will find how to use it for their own needs.  Our motivations, preferences, desires, <i>connections</i> , likes and dislikes, moods and attitudes will be read as in an open book, stitched into a thick folder, and used.  &lt;Of course, all this knowledge that we shared will be used on us.  And for ourselves.  For our benefit, or our harm, is not the point.  The main nuance is that this knowledge will be used implicitly, as closed data of sociological research.  But with selectivity, not to a ‚Äúsocial group‚Äù, but to a specific person.  And this influence on us, in the first place, will be used in offline life.  Summing up, you can try to form such a definition: ‚ÄúThe use and adaptation of‚Äú Web 2.0 ‚Äùservices to dominate the usual institutions of government and business in all areas of the lives of ordinary people is the main feature of the Internet version of‚Äú Web 3.0 ‚Äù.‚Äù <br><br>  However, as I said, everything written about Web 3.0 is fantasy.  Which may be such, may not be, but may be, but only partially. <br>  One thing is certain: in the era of ‚ÄúWeb 3.0‚Äù (whatever it may be) people will more and more openly express their preferences and <i>connections</i> with other people.  But, as is always the case after an excessive hobby for something, more and more people will realize (some - due to their own negative experience) that the connections / preferences open to each and every one are not such a necessary thing.  Moreover, it may sometimes be unnecessary.  And sometimes even dangerous.  And then a rollback of the same inadequate power will be reversed.  Towards anonymity.  So ‚ÄúWeb 4.0‚Äù will appear. <br><br>  <b>The main features of ‚ÄúWeb 4.0‚Äù</b> are closeness or lack of public social connections of people.  The paranoia principle elevated to the rank of a good form: privacy of any personal information, encryption of any data transmitted over the network, de-identification of its presence on the Internet.  I will try to show how I see it on the example of the already mentioned ‚Äúroom‚Äù. <br>  Perhaps the light still remains on.  But all the people in the room will put on masks, open their hands, and put gloves on their hands (in case of possible contact). <br>  ‚Äú- / friends?  I have no friends.  / tags?  I have no / tags.  And if there is, then those are not my / tags.  And in general, it was not me.  Nickname?  I don't have any ‚Äúnickname‚Äù.  /profile.php?  What do you mean?  Such a page does not exist at all for a hundred years, you live just like in the last century ... " <br>  The word "social" will acquire a negative connotation.  And all the ‚Äúsocial‚Äù services, previously popular with people, will turn into ‚Äúpersonal‚Äù services.  Many services, the ‚Äúsociality‚Äù of which was a key success factor, can suffer very serious losses, and turn into services with access to information only for one person, using ssh login password.  Circles of people's interests will turn into dry statistics: <i>‚Äú1024 users love‚Äú sex ‚Äù‚Äù</i> - but who these people will be will be impossible to see - because of privacy. <br>  Maybe people rushed in the opposite direction will be a minority.  Maybe ‚ÄúWeb 3.0‚Äù will become such a significant factor in public life that some people simply will not be able to <i>disconnect</i> .  And others will not be allowed to do this. <br><br>  However, this is also a fantasy.  And perhaps, by the terms Web 1/2/3 / 4.0, I described something quite different from what other people understand.  Or maybe with someone my thoughts, on the contrary, converge. <br>  I want in the near future to make a small "private" site-service, focused on people who do not want to advertise their information.  Or someone will do this before me, not the essence.  The main thing is that as users of such a resource grow, it will be possible to judge how the words in this article resemble the truth. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/18452/">https://habr.com/ru/post/18452/</a></p>
