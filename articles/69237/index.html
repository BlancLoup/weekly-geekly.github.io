But the battle for the information environment will occur precisely between these three: Apple, Google and Microsoft. <br><br>  All three companies are constantly fighting with each other on different fronts: for search engines, software and hardware, services and services. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Apple‚Äôs ban on Google‚Äôs voice apps from iTunes on iTunes was just the first shot that unleashed a lengthy war over control of the flow of world communication and information.

      What will this battle be?  Understanding where each of the companies is currently located will help assess rates and understand who is winning. <br><br>  I conducted a small study of each of the companies regarding the range offered to users - from music to phones and Internet services - and I got interesting results: The largest of the upcoming battles will happen between Apple and Google, and which, using a variety of digital resources, is controlled by the users themselves.  Why exactly Apple and Google?  We see that Apple leads on each of the platforms. <br><br>  And Google has an indisputable advantage in the field of search engines and a huge gateway to various user services that it does not yet provide, but it redirects users to other sites. <br><br><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_bJJJYSjRDfE/SqiyE2d9y0I/AAAAAAAAA3w/pshwnnbXMRA/s800/%D0%A1%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%BE%D0%BA%20%D1%8D%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B0%201.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Microsoft is clearly dominant in terms of operating systems, with such a share in the global market, that Apple and Google will not soon be able to get close to it.  However, the existing government restrictions for Windows significantly impede its development in new markets such as search engines, music and other new industries.  So the number of Windows Mobile users is impressive, but it seems to be losing ground in front of Apple‚Äôs iPhone. <br><br>  Apple's ‚Äúecosystem‚Äù of technical support - iPods, iPhones - the main threat to Google.  These devices contribute to the development of Apple and network services (iTunes, Safari, MobileMe, and the like). This is the main reason why Google is trying to get a foothold with its own system software for mobile phones - the Android platform.  Reports indicate that 1.5 million Android system phones were sold.  Not much compared with sales of the iPhone, but, nevertheless, noticeable.  The biggest threat to Google is that Apple seems to be the only company in the world that is considered ‚Äúcooler‚Äù by Google.  Changing the course of the game Apple steps in the field of music and phones is not easy to repeat.  Just compare with the Palm Pre or Microsoft Zune.  Being cool is not easy. <br><br>  In the ideal world, Microsoft could embed anything into Windows.  And this would make it very difficult to get your market share for both Apple and Google.  However, since the software becomes a ‚Äúservice‚Äù rather than an installed program, this advantage would most likely disappear over time.  Isn't it a mockery that most of Google‚Äôs employees came from Netscape, which Microsoft defeated as a fanfare in the software market.  However, this time it is not related to the software, it is network services, server farms, distribution of network information controlled by the end user. <br><br>  There are other dangers for the trinity mentioned above, and the biggest of them is facebook, which has over 200 million users worldwide.  But for a variety of reasons, it is still not so easy to overthrow any of the above. <br><br>  About 5 years ago I would say that Apple is the new Sony, and Pixar is the new Disney (both are led by Steve Jobs).  Today, Pixar owns Disney, and Apple is the undisputed king in the world of electronic media for music, television, movies, applications, and much more provided by them. <br><br>  Why else did Amazon launch its own ebook reader, the Kindle?  Because Apple's iPods would at one point be the number one e-book reader, just like it was with music. <br><br>  Who will win this battle?  I think Apple now has an advantage, due to the fact that they have been on the market for 32 years, and had experience of mistakes (even large ones, as in the case when they helped Microsoft), they had their ups and downs with products and guidance.  Experience and ability to produce cool new products supports consumer demand (look at Apple‚Äôs latest balance sheet). <br><br>  To achieve the same, Microsoft will need to accelerate its development in the field of consumer-oriented services and create many new services.  Not Yahoo, but Twitter, Facebook. <br><br>  Google also needs experts from Apple to better understand consumer experience.  Look at Orkut - they still have problems and server failures over the years.  The Google Base database will not beat Craigslist.  Google Docs is not overthrown by Office.  Even the Android platform is more like a technical solution than a consumer one. <br><br>  <i>Ps.</i>  <i>Transferred to Research and forecasts (seems to fit).</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/69237/">https://habr.com/ru/post/69237/</a></p>
