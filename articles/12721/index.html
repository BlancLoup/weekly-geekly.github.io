It would seem that the wand for cleaning the ears is such a trifle that you should not pay attention to.  But it is hardly worthwhile to stumble upon this product in black, as it immediately attracts attention.  Especially if you are Japanese, but more on that later. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/782/b45/59e/782b4559e1454f48aabba795cf2992c6.jpg" width="450" height="302" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  When this product, invented and manufactured by Heiwa Medic, appeared in Japanese stores a couple of years ago, various media outlets and simple bloggers immediately thought it necessary to inform about it.  Of course, the novelty then attracted attention.  After all, these sticks are usually white.  Sometimes there are other colors, but black is the first time. <br>  On the black wool, moreover, pollution due to contrast is noticeable no less than on white.  Not to mention the fact that the black color of the inhabitants of the Land of the Rising Sun is associated with purity and, consequently, with a set of other virtues arising from this virtue.

      And now about these black sticks started talking again.  The reason for this is not only in the new marketing moves that the company has begun to make again, but also in some trends in the Japanese market that affect the most diverse products. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/1ea/5d0/c46/1ea5d0c46d3785ab25156dc83cbca6b3.jpg" width="450" height="305" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br>  Actually, we are talking about a steady increase in the popularity of koro goods in Japan - that‚Äôs the word ‚Äúblack‚Äù in Japanese black goods). <br><br>  By the way, the aforementioned company is not alone in its desire to literally denigrate its hygienic products.  Here, for example, the company Jacks began to produce toothbrushes, which are made of black plastic;  and their stubble is also almost black. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/dc4/31c/a8c/dc431ca8c278696dbcc645ffc3cf3888.jpg" width="450" height="172" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  It was not without progressive innovations: these bristles are made with the addition of some special ceramics with platinum, combating dental plaque and other dental monsters from advertising.  Moreover, as reported, innovation is so effective that it allows you to even forget about the toothpaste and do without it at all. <br><br>  However, the owner of such a wonderful device without paste can not do.  And the point here is not at all that the paste will contrast with the black brush, casting obligatory reflections on the harmony of yin and yang and other aesthetic problems.  A suitable paste will not be contrasted, because, as you guessed, it also ‚Äúis found‚Äù in Japanese stores in a black ‚Äúformat‚Äù. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/9ab/fd6/03f/9abfd603f6ed043aeb06106eda1de12d.jpg" width="450" height="341" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  All this of course is understandable: solidity, cleanliness, accuracy.  For the sake of all this, someone is ready to challenge their fears and brush their teeth with such brushes and stick their own chopsticks into their ears.  But black toothpaste ... <br><br>  No, the Japanese have a completely different mindset - well, not at all the same as in the West.  After all, this paste, which produces the Japanese company Three-Hills, is in demand. <br>  But let's talk about something more pleasant.  About food, for example. <br>  According to legend, since ancient times, the secret of Japanese cuisine ... Damn, and everything is black! <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/12b/5ff/1b8/12b5ff1b8d418a298bfc5becece9b197.jpg" width="450" height="288" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  The board for cutting, of course, is very good if it is made of ceramic material.  Ceramics is not really rotting and does not really rust, and does not absorb odors, it is easy to wash it, but it doesn‚Äôt spit on bacteria.  It is also very good if it bends.  It is not clear what is good, and what kind of ceramics was used for this, but in general - great.  However, this board is also black. <br><br>  The Japanese company OTOKOMAE TOFUTEN produces tofu - bean curd, which is made from the same soy milk.  It would seem that he could not be black.  It is actually not black, but some black beans are added to one of the varieties of such cottage cheese, so this product can also be credited to the black list - in the first approximation ... <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/457/5ba/9eb/4575ba9ebf32fd60f87bf67ec46f650d.jpg" width="450" height="242" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  A normal person will not shove salt into bamboo stalks, and then fry them on charcoal.  But that is a normal European person.  But a normal Japanese person will be and still will be - especially if he works at Gensen Ginmi, which, among other products, makes such a strange salt.  They say this salt is delicious.  But this is not so important: the main thing is that it is black. <br><br>  What we will salt?  Of course, the eggs!  What are eggs?  Naturally, black! <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/870/7dc/1f7/8707dc1f7a4c5ce9a93256f4153da46d.jpg" width="450" height="192" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  What kind of bird in Japan rushing black eggs - you do not know?  We do not know either, but we know that Japanese businessmen in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Owakudani Valley (Owakudani) cook eggs of ordinary birds (most likely, chickens) in hot sulfur springs.  As a result of any chemical reactions that occur during cooking, the shell turns black.  And this is great! <br><br>  No, you just imagine what a furore you will make if you take a black egg out of a pocket of a black jacket and start to eat it with an appetite!  This will have a particularly powerful effect on others if you do it on board a Star Flyer passenger aircraft. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/ba9/ce8/185/ba9ce81852e94cbd6547c57e6f7674e1.jpg" width="450" height="306" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  Since March 2006, Star Flyer flights are carried out between two Japanese cities - Tokyo and Kitakyushu.  Of course, you already understood that we spoke about him for a reason.  Yes Yes Yes.  He is really black outside - mostly (his picture is in the very first illustration). <br><br>  And inside it, by the way, is also clean and solid.  We wanted to say black.  Not completely, however, black - only the floor and leather seats, but still. <br><br>  The main role of this color is given not only in the cabin.  Star Flyer in the toilet even paper of the appropriate color  That's where it is, civilization! <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/144/609/1c1/1446091c15fbbd97e049dd34d196822f.jpg" width="450" height="265" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  On this optimistic note, we end our message about the black, but not at all pessimistic, trend of the Japanese market. <br><br>  via <a href="http://www.membrana.ru/">www.membrana.ru</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/12721/">https://habr.com/ru/post/12721/</a></p>
