  <section class="page js-page"><h1>BayanICQ</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Sometimes it is so difficult to find an ICQ client that would suit the user in all respects ... Some work not as stable as we would like, the other lacks functionality, and the third does not suit the interface.  And all this even with the current diversity of the relevant programs!  The situation is even more aggravated when it comes to the ICQ-client on a mobile device, for example, one of the many Nokia smartphones running Symbian S60 3rd Edition.  Yes, a considerable number of various instant messengers were made under this platform, but for me personally, each of them had significant shortcomings, forcing to try more and more new clients in the pursuit of perfection. <br>  So, in this article I will talk about a relatively new ICQ-client for Symbian 9, which, in my opinion, is closer to the ideal than the rest - this is BayanICQ. <br><br><img title="BayanICQ" alt="ICQ" src="http://i042.radikal.ru/0812/a2/ee8b80bb49bd.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  What is so special about this client?  First of all, it performs all the same functions as the others ‚Äî it sends and receives ICQ messages, and it does it really well ‚Äî there was not a single loss noticed during all the time I use it (approximately from the beginning of September) messages (both incoming and outgoing) that are not related to failures directly on AOL's servers (then all clients had glitches in this area).  In addition, the program has a lot of nice features, and here are some of them (highlighted only those that are not in every mobile ICQ client): <br><ul><li>  Animated smiley support </li><li>  Display report delivery message to the server, or to the addressee </li><li>  Storage and ability to export message history to a text file </li><li>  Two-way typing notification </li><li>  Antispam </li><li>  Full set of basic and additional statuses </li><li>  The installation of the security statute </li><li>  Installation "Ball of Joy" </li><li>  Service messages (a kind of log containing information about who entered / left, read your status, etc.) </li><li>  Jobs with private lists (visibility, invisibility and ignore on the server, as well as a list of blocking at the client level) </li><li>  Choice: download contact list every time or use local copy </li><li>  Deleting yourself from someone else's contact list and, conversely, allowing the contact to add yourself </li><li>  Definition of the client user (there is not all, but the main ones are) </li><li>  Local search (searches by nickname and number in the contact list) </li><li>  Advanced sound and vibration settings </li><li>  Displaying a window with a status on top of all windows (including when the client is minimized) </li><li>  Displaying pop-up messages when the contact status changes, as well as when someone starts writing to you and when a message arrives (including when the client is minimized, in the manner of popup windows in computer clients) </li><li>  Message notification by flashing backlight </li><li>  Run in portrait and landscape modes </li><li>  Support for "skins", as well as the ability to set the theme of the phone as a design </li><li>  Customizable font sizes </li><li>  Configure Hot Keys </li><li>  Support for simultaneous work with multiple profiles </li></ul>  The functionality of the program is increased from version to version, and at the same time, no matter how surprising it is, the client does not become cumbersome and does not begin to consume too much memory, which is important for devices with a small amount of RAM.  Test versions of the client, available for download on the official forum, are published quite often and usually contain all sorts of minor improvements and fixes, and sometimes several new features.  The stable versions are available for download directly from the developer‚Äôs main page - they are released much less frequently, but they contain all the ‚Äúchips‚Äù of previously released test versions all at once, and they have been thoroughly tested. <br>  At the moment, the last stable version is 0.097, the test version is 0.1rc3. <br><br>  <i>Frequently asked questions:</i>

      Q: Why do my skins get cut off from above, I download the skins of my permission ... <br>  A: Click on the Full Screen mode hot key in the contacts menu. <br>  Q: Why can not see the disabled contacts? <br>  A: It is necessary to press the "Hide / show disabled" hot key. <br>  Q: I put the Bayan, chose animated emoticons, but they do not plow, even after a restart, what should I do? <br>  A: It is necessary to select a memory reserve (Settings&gt; System) of at least 4 MB and restart the Bayan. <br>  Q: And what does contact blocking give? <br>  A: As you know, the ignore list in ICQ is not rubber.  In search of a solution to this problem, the contact has been blocked.  If a lock is displayed over the contact, the user's messages will no longer disturb you, and the user will not be able to read your x-status. <br>  Q: I put a fresh version of Bayan, but he does not connect and immediately flies out ... <br>  A: You need to delete the file on the way!: / System / Apps / bayanICQ / settings.dat and then go again.  If it does not enter again, then set ‚ÄúUse access point‚Äù settings to ‚ÄúNo‚Äù. <br>  Q: Again, it does not turn around!  What to do? <br>  A: Delete the file!: / System / Apps / bayanICQ / users.us and go to Bayan again. <br>  Q: It does not connect when the automatic connection is set. <br>  A: Delete the settings.dat file, which is responsible for the profile settings and, in particular, for the auto-connect parameter.  Having removed it, you should not experience any problems with entering this plan. <br>  Q: The program after installation does not respond to the click on the icon, it does not start at all, what should I do? <br>  A: You must delete the file!: / System / Data / BayanICQ.heap <br><br><img title="BayanICQ" alt="ICQ" src="http://i055.radikal.ru/0812/b7/047830dee176.jpg"><img title="BayanICQ" alt="ICQ" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/837/516/271/837516271a8208d1d0c16121933a7096.jpg"><br><br>  Of course, in order to better understand all the possibilities and advantages of BayanICQ, it is necessary to ‚Äúfeel‚Äù the program yourself.  Within the framework of a small review it is difficult to tell about all the nuances of this messenger.  However, even a little that was able to tell, it is enough to come to the conclusion that BayanICQ is a very good ICQ-client that will allow you to be constantly in touch. <br><br>  Developer: Alexander Barobin. <br>  Official website: <a href="http://www.barobin.com/">http://www.barobin.com/</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/46930/">https://habr.com/ru/post/46930/</a></p>
