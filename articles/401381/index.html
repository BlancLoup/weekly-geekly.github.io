Frequently, a hologram is called a stereoscopic image formed in a special way, but this makes little difference.  Technologies for reproducing such images have become familiar.  So familiar that even politicians use them. <br><br>  For example, Jean-Luc Melenchon (Jean-Luc Melenchon), presidential candidate of France.  Last Sunday, <a href="http://www.lemonde.fr/election-presidentielle-2017/video/2017/02/06/jean-luc-melenchon-apparait-en-meeting-sous-forme-d-hologramme_5075207_4854003.html">he decided to</a> use the three-dimensional image to show his performance in two cities at once.  Obviously, potential voters would hardly approve the video.  But the hologram is able to attract the attention of even people who are far from the games of the servants of the people.  As a result, he visited both the center of Lyon and Paris, 450 km from Lyon.  The fact that this is a hologram was understandable by the transparency of the image and the muffled voice. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  According to pre-technology experts, Melenshon is trying to circumvent Marine Le Pen and other rivals using modern technologies.  The cost of the system for a voluminous broadcast of a politician speech per 500 km (with a two-second delay in playback) ranged from 30 to 40 thousand euros.

In 2014, it was Tayyip Erdogan, who duplicated his speech with a huge hologram.  This, by the way, was a good step, which drew attention to the speech of the leader of Turkey.  And the Indian politician Narendra Modi showed voluminous images of his own performance to residents of small villages in the country. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f75/e3d/47e/f75e3d47e46d6bc2405e4cd45c324658.jpg" width="850"><br>  <font color="gray">The hardware installed on the stage with the politician <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-election-idUSKBN15K0Q7">made it possible to</a> broadcast his voluminous video copy to another French city, where Melenchon simply did not have time to perform live</font> <br><br>  As for Erdogan, he, not having time to come to Izmir in 2014, decided to take advantage of modern technologies and form his own three-dimensional image on the stage. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CaA-UeHKbdE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Holograms are used not only by politicians, but also by pop stars, commercial enterprises.  Back in 2011, Manchester Airport began using volumetric images of real employees to improve the speed and quality of customer service.  These holograms <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/112862/">greet passengers</a> at the entrance to the inspection area, explaining the restrictions on the transfer of liquids on the plane. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want anyone to throw away a drink or cosmetics, so we tried many different ways to propagate the rules for transporting liquids, from posters to people dressed as giant deodorants,‚Äù said airport employee Julie Keper, who became the prototype for the chart. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ej0GMLD4HwI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  According to the developers, such three-dimensional images can provide an improvement in the quality of service not only for airport passengers, but also for customers of various stores, catering outlets, and similar organizations and companies. <br><br>  In 2015, <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/248982/">a</a> protest march of holograms <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/248982/">was organized</a> in Madrid.  The action lasted about an hour, and more than 2000 people took part in it, who became unhappy with the introduction of restrictions on holding mass meetings.  The authors of the project decided to demonstrate the ephemeral nature of any public demonstrations, since, in their opinion, such events are now controlled by the Spanish authorities. <br><br>  In New York, a similar action was earlier organized by opponents of the removal of Edward Snowden‚Äôs bust set in Fort Green.  Members of the Illuminator movement decided to replace this bust with a holographic image, which stood for about two hours, after which the police removed it. <br><br>  Used volumetric images and representatives of the stage.  Virtual singer Hatsune Miku with a synthesized voice often performs in Japan.  The company Crypton Future Media developed this technology (having invented the identity of the singer herself).  The differences in the behavior of the participants of the virtual star concert from the behavior of visitors to the performances of real artists are not noticed.  At one time, holograms of Tupac Shakur, Michael Jackson and other performers performed on the stage. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/401381/">https://habr.com/ru/post/401381/</a></p>
