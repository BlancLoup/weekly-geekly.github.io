And I have just on the bow hiking on May holidays, a sin not to get acquainted with the material.  The material says that, when he was his deputy, Alexander Chupriyan raised the actual question of regulating rescue actions and global accounting for tourist groups, routes and other data for the prompt rescue of tourists in case of a sudden emergency.  And such activities at that time in some regions are already underway.  And they will prepare a multi-year plan to extend this activity to all regions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cf8/15a/6fb/cf815a6fb25345974db9bdd21b1c6181.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  ‚ÄúTourists should know that they are protected!‚Äù - Alexander Chupriyan set the task for his colleagues in the service.  It was back in 2007.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Well, many years have passed, for sure the Ministry of Emergency Situations has coped with the task - I thought.  Moreover, in the news reports, the ministries constantly flash recommendations to travel groups to register when leaving the route, register with the local State Administration, receive weather reports and emergency forecasts from them.  Probably I should register my event, although it will take place only 4 days in the forests of the Karelian Isthmus, but no one has canceled wild animals, injuries, storms and thunderstorms.  I am asking about the necessity of registering a group of cyclists at the Main Directorate of the Ministry of Emergency Situations in LO.  Contrary to all expectations, they do not ask me to provide the route, the size of the group and the exit / return dates according to the recommendations, but ... refer this question to the Committee for Physical Culture and Sports of the Leningrad Region and the administration of the area where my route will go.  Of course, I sent a request, but I doubt that in case of a sudden hurricane, the sports committee will promptly notify me via SMS, send a search team to my route, and in general will remember that there were some tourists in the forest ... Indeed, in 2007 they planned to register make on the basis of MES. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a71/d35/d7f/a71d35d7f25c1f7f27fa0d93c6ba1df6.jpg" alt="image"><br></a> <br><br>  And how are the neighbors?  The search for ‚Äúregistration of tourist groups of the Ministry of Emergency Situations‚Äù gives an elegant selection of recommendations and tips, and in the Republic of Karelia there is even a special section on the website of the Ministry of Emergency Situations designed to facilitate and automate the process.  Judging by indirect signs, the service has existed since 2014.  Just think, it took only seven years for the regional government department to implement such a useful innovation.  In an interview taken in September 2014 ( <a href="http://10.mchs.gov.ru/pressroom/intervju/item/247888">10.mchs.gov.ru/pressroom/intervju/item/247888</a> ), the Head of the Main Office of the Ministry of Emergency Situations in the Republic of Karelia recommends using this service. <br>  I quote: "In addition, the site has a resource" I am a tourist ", which allows you to inform rescuers about your tourist route. Information about the need for registration is regularly posted on tourist portals, in the media, as well as on elements of the territorial subsystem OKSION." <br><br>  And indeed, there is a section on registration of tourist groups on the site, which for some reason takes us to a third-party company site, which was last updated, according to (C), in the same 2014.  The site has a form for making your own route, a tourist registration form.  And, for some reason, access to the database is registered. <br>  Full access. <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/TuuqC1Lr42k%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700019,15700043,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhi7YfBO4wmtlzcS69pFQ2eUzv1uqw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  I will say right away - at that time, when I started a small journalistic experiment, the base was pristine and there were no tourists on the routes.  In any case, the fields visible in the database.  Having no problems getting a new tourist, I went to the accounting section and deleted it.  Repeated.  Repeated from different computers to exclude the possibility of binding the display of a particular tourist to a specific computer.  Everything went well - having taken a tourist on the same computer, I easily deleted it from another PC. <br>  Even in the database, there was a very up-to-date notification service for all registered tourists about an emergency / storm / bad weather via SMS distribution.  I repent, sent for the experiment one message to myself.  Ready to reimburse 2 rubles to the ministry.  The service is working.  Any joker can go to the website of the Ministry of Emergency Situations on behalf of the Ministry to inform someone about something. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/695/192/c3b/695192c3badfc2cb88dee149cfb71e23.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Of course, I immediately contacted the Ministry of Emergency Situations of the Russian Federation, notifying them about the security hole, asked for contacts of the Karelian Department and sent them a message with a detailed description of the problem.  Hopefully, they will quickly solve this situation. <br><br>  But the thought is tormenting how many tourists over the years have taken advantage of this service and blithely went for a walk in the woods, hoping that if something happens, they will be saved and not thinking that any attacker can ‚Äúclean out‚Äù the EMERCOM accounting database?  Why are ministry employees so careless?  Did they realize the task they were given almost 10 years ago at the highest level? <br><br>  If you believe the website of the Ministry of Emergency Situations, Alexander Chupriyan is still in the position of deputy minister and I take this opportunity to turn to him: <br><br>  <b><i>Alexander Petrovich, are the tourists protected?</i></b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/282145/">https://habr.com/ru/post/282145/</a></p>
