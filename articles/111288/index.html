      Today, when the world changes in the blink of an eye, it is becoming increasingly difficult to keep afloat, especially for people in the field of information technology.  Having the desire, little experience, strength and capable thinking, I was faced with the problem of choice.  It would seem obvious to work in the field of IT or how my friends answer the question of choice: ‚Äúyou can do it with computers, so work with them.‚Äù  It turns out not so simple. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0a1/ed1/fc7/0a1ed1fc779eb43a9c3032f8c393b4c0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  However, having decided to surrender to the field of information technology, the issue was not resolved.  Having studied the demand for the market and labor and average wages, all the same it was possible to concretize. <br><ul><li>  System Administrator </li><li>  programmer </li></ul><br><br>  After analyzing my desires, I came to the conclusion that I can be realized in a large company.  Such companies take, for example, a network salesman who raises a network with a mop.  And not because the network fell, but because it seemed.  Such a networker, of course, can create queries to the database and can quickly read ‚ÄúIt Works!‚Äù In the browser.  But he doesn‚Äôt do it, for this there is a DBA and a web programmer who knows how to set up ip-addresses, but they call the first one in order not to bother with this nonsense.  So you need to specialize more. <br><br>  So we come to the conclusion that system administrators are also different and the choice does not end there.  Working as an advanced enikeyschikom, I touch on many aspects of the life of a sysadmin.  Attachment to the site, the zeal of the cleaners, the imperfection of the iron - all this does not allow a well-tuned system to work without failures once.  And therefore requires constant presence.  By virtue of my hobby, I do not like it. <br><br>  Another thing is a programmer.  It can work anywhere (hereafter: maybe it doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean).  Something does not work there mainly because of the programmer‚Äôs fault, and not because the pipe exploded and the server was flooded.  Problem solving rarely requires urgent departure.  So the choice falls on the programmer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a38/d22/ec8/a38d22ec89b7a9619f677d05b74e9b9a.png" alt="image"><br><br>  However, not everything is so simple, programmers turn out to be different and the issue of choice is not resolved.  The diagram is too general scheme.  On Habr√© many polls, comparisons of programming languages.  The choice is great and difficult.  Choosing a language, you need to spend enough time to learn it.  And I really would not want to spend this time in vain.  I put it on JAVA - the issue was resolved recently and the results are even impossible to predict. <br><br>  There are a lot of tips, there is someone to help, thanks to Q &amp; A - they send it well there, but one day a survey appeared on Habr√© (I won‚Äôt find a link) about what language java-programmers are going to learn ... OMG!  They are also in front of a choice. <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/riJRkURWitk%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhiwCONw_6WHfn-4cChgH1m9tYtBgQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  So the question "What to do?" Will never leave me?  Are there universal solutions?  I would very much like to hear ‚Äútake care of it, you will need 5 years of life, but then you will not know misfortune‚Äù.  Or is it just as utopian as the applicant's thoughts about a bright future, his graduated, after uni? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/111288/">https://habr.com/ru/post/111288/</a></p>
