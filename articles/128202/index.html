  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Details about the new programming language Google Dart (Dash)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A couple of days ago, the Web spread <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/google/128058/">news</a> that Google is going to present in October 2011 a new web programming language Dart.  Unfortunately, there was no additional information on this topic.  However, the newsgroup com.googlegroups.google-caja-discuss archived a <a href="http://markmail.org/message/uro3jtoitlmq6x7t">letter</a> with the title ‚ÄúFuture of Javascript doc from our internal JavaScript Summit‚Äù, dated November 16, 2010, which gives at least some idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat Dash is (there is mentioned such a name).  The letter is based on the internal meeting of leading Google developers on the development of client-side web programming languages. <br><br>  In short, Google is developing Dash as a replacement / alternative to Javascript.  At the meeting, developers agreed that Javascript has ‚Äúfundamental‚Äù flaws that cannot be fixed by evolutionary development. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  There are two solutions to the problem.  The first is an attempt to correct the disadvantages of Javacript that are possible (the Harmony project).  This work will take years and in any case will not be 100% successful, because the fundamental flaws and historical baggage will still remain. <br><br>  The second option, in parallel with the first, is the creation of a new Dash programming language, which will preserve the dynamic nature of Javascript, but will provide better performance and will be suitable for use in large projects.  At the same time, Google will ensure the openness of the language and will contribute to its support by other browsers.  In addition, developers will get a cross-compiler, so the Dash code can be translated into Javascript for browsers that do not natively support Dash. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      The second option is more risky, but if successful, it provides a real breakthrough. <br><br>  Google has no right to bet only on the second option, because in case of failure, Google‚Äôs leadership positions on the web will be seriously undermined, and the development process of Javascript will slow down.  So it is planned to simultaneously promote both options.  The first is a safety net in case of failure of the second.  The Harmony project will be actively promoted by Google, as well as Dash. <br><br>  Dash is a revolutionary option.  A programming language that can completely replace Javascript.  It is designed with three main objectives in mind: <br><ul><li>  <b>Performance.</b>  Dash virtual machines will not have the performance problems that all EcmaScript machines have. </li><li>  <b>Ease of development.</b>  The dynamic, easy-to-learn, compilation-free nature of Javascript will be preserved, making the web platform the absolute leader among amateur programmers. </li><li>  <b>Support for code editors and additional tools.</b>  Dash is designed to make it easier to use additional tools for large, serious projects that require support, including functions such as refactoring and searching for places to call functions.  At the same time, Dash will not necessarily require the use of a code editor for efficient programming, so an ordinary developer may well be satisfied with the work in a text editor. </li></ul>  Dash should also provide maximum security where this task does not conflict with the three main ones. <br><br>  It is assumed that Dash support will be built into all browsers as the main native client language (instead of Javascript), it will also be used on front-end servers, as well as in cross-compilers. <br><br>  The Dash language is developed by the famous programmer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lars_Bak_(computer_programmer)">Lars</a> Bak and his development team in the Danish office.  Additional tools are created by the Bruce Johnson team in Atlanta, and Web Inspector support for Dash and Harmony is done by Pavel Feldman (Pavel Feldman) with developers from Google's office in St. Petersburg. <br><br>  In November 2010, it was assumed that the first fragments of Dash support in the Chrome browser will appear within a year.  For other browsers, a cross-compiler will be released, and native support will appear much later, and you will have to wait up to several years.  Lars Buck promised ‚Äúnice talk‚Äù with the developers of other browsers about the Dash language, and if the product turns out to be very high-quality, then they themselves will want to implement its support as soon as possible. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/128202/">https://habr.com/ru/post/128202/</a></p>
