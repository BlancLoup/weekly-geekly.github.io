One of the directions of such work is the blockchain technology offer as a service for developers.  To help developers more quickly understand the corporate use of this technology, IBM has transferred about 44,000 lines of code to the open <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/">project Hyperledger of</a> the Linux Foundation consortium.  In addition, the source code is also posted on <a href="https://github.com/openblockchain">GitHub</a> . <br><br>  "This is one of the fastest growing projects within the Linux Foundation in our memory," said Tom Rosamilia, senior vice president of IBM Systems, in a report at the IBM-sponsored PartnerWorld Leadership conference. Now a large number of economists are confident that There is a great future behind the blockchain technology. Perhaps, experts say, blockchain will help change the approach to the implementation of financial transactions. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  IBM also made several announcements about expanding the scope of blockchain technology:

      <b>New blockchain services in IBM Cloud</b> : services of this type help to create and manage blockchain networks to support the work of a new class of distributed financial applications.  Now developers will be able to create digital assets and corresponding business logic, which will open up the possibility for a more secure and confidential transfer of assets between participants of the blockchain test network with limited and protected access rights.  Using IBM's new blockchain technology, available on Bluemix, developers can use fully integrated DevOps tools to create, deploy, launch and monitor blockchain applications on the IBM Cloud.  Applications of this type can also be deployed on <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/ibm/blog/279571/">IBM z Systems</a> , providing an additional level of security for especially valuable data.  Blockchain applications can access existing systems on Z Systems distributed servers and computers through an API, thus supporting new types of payment, transaction, procurement and business management procedures. <br><br>  <b>Connecting IoT data to the blockchain</b> : using the Watson IoT Platform, IBM will use such types of data as device positioning coordinates using radio modules, readable bar codes, or data received from devices directly.  IoT gadgets themselves will be able to work with distributed blockchain logs to update and view contact data.  For example, the location and temperature of the package, when using this technology, will be automatically recorded and recorded in the blockchain.  At the same time, all parties related to the package will be able to receive an update of its status. <br><br>  <b>IBM Garages for blockchain developers</b> : IBM Garages is, one might say, maintenance stations that are planned to open in the near future in London, New York, Singapore and Tokyo.  This is done in order to allow IBM representatives to work with developers involved in the design and implementation of blockchains for business needs.  IBM Global Business Services also plans to extend consulting services on blockchain issues to clients in the financial and banking sectors, plus in the logistics sector.  It is planned to start working with IBM Interactive Experience (IBM iX) in the development of implementation options for the blockchain in more than 25 IBM studios around the world (IBM Studios). <br><br>  IBM has several of the largest partners in the financial sector, including the London Stock Exchange - the London Stock Exchange Group and the Finnish business development organization - Kouvola Innovation. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe London Stock Exchange Group is directly involved in the development of open blockchain technologies with IBM, and we are extremely happy to help create risk management tools and bring additional transparency to global financial markets.  We believe that this technology can trigger changes in our business, but we need to develop it together with clients and industry participants, adhering to the principles of open source, ‚Äùsaid Mois Kohari, executive vice president and head of technological innovation at the London Stock Exchange Group. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/583/a2e/c06/583a2ec0689b41e0bd01c21dde93abcc.png"><br><br>  As for the Hyperledger project of the Linux Foundation consortium, about 35 international-class specialists, as well as about 100 technical architects, took part in its creation.  The project was created solely for the purpose of preparing blockchain technology for business services. <br><br>  As a result of the project to open the source code of the blockchain technology, the business received an improved identity management process, which is based on the latest achievements of cryptography, means of monitoring and controlling privacy and confidentiality, as well as smart contracts based on Java and Go with the ability to define user rights who have access to these contracts. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/279801/">https://habr.com/ru/post/279801/</a></p>
