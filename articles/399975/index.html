On the eve of all these events, a shopping spree begins with the goal of preparing everything for the holidays and get gifts in advance for all loved ones.  And it was very well at this time that the universal electronic card Dadjet came into my hands, which is designed to save space in your pocket and save money.  How it turns out, see under the cut.  Well, who is too lazy to read - at the end of the material there will be a video where I will step by step tell about the work of the card. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8d3/0f4/0a6/8d30f40a6b144639a69b6645f656e30f.JPG"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The idea to collect all the bonus and discount cards in one place soared for a long time.  Special wallets for cards are very popular.  But to carry with you, in addition to documents, rights, keys to the house / car / work, there is also a separate wallet with discount cards?  No, thank you!  Therefore, I was left without discounts more and more when, in obedience to the impulse, I went to the store for a thing I liked.  Everything was decided literally in one day, when I received the coveted package from the courier's hands.  In the package was a small box with a device inside. <br><br>  The kit includes a card reader with a cable.

Working with the device is intuitive and even a computer is not required for these simple actions.  All you need is all available loyalty cards, a USB port with power (suitable for charging the phone) and a smartphone with Android or iOS on board. <br><br>  <b>Cut the cards to one</b> <br><br>  Start by installing the application.  It is easy to find by the name of Cardberry. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/90b/14b/6f0/90b14b6f0bc448acaf32384f20ca5968.jpg"></div><br>  During the registration of the application, you are required to provide your number, as it is used for binding.  In the case of a phone change, it will be enough to log in using the old number and get a list of all available cards.  When registering send SMS with confirmation code. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/30e/36b/4d8/30e36b4d87fe45179fc626a2cae46a6e.jpg"></div><br>  Next, in a few steps, add a new map.  First we photograph from the application from two sides.  This will then identify it visually, although you can search by name. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7a1/927/ec5/7a1927ec5a14449abb4c0489f5a11609.jpg"></div><br>  The next step is to choose the method of identification cards in the store: it is a bar code and / or magnetic stripe.  Put the appropriate checkboxes and the scanner window appears.  If the bar code is simply scanned by the camera, then you must contact the card reader to read the magnetic strip.  It must be connected to power and we just roll the card.  On the screen we get a QR code and it is read by the camera of the smartphone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ca0/dee/aab/ca0deeaab740459d9dacf233aa255fe8.jpg"><br><br>  Cards can be classified by type (discount, accumulative, bonus, other) and purpose (food, car parts, etc.).  Gradually, the list will be updated and the application will look like this. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/082/2c0/9fd/0822c09fd78447389033310c54c04414.jpg"></div><br>  <b>How to behave in the store</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5e2/0d1/5b4/5e20d15b4a614fe7a4a1a0fa7fbcadd4.jpg"><br><br>  What to do with this card next?  And now you can take with you only one card and go shopping.  Before purchasing, it is enough to turn on the map with a button (one second to see the flashing blue LED), launch the application and select the desired card.  The smartphone will communicate with the card via Bluetooth and transfer the data to the chip, but the latter will already magnetize the tape, as required.  If the map is only with a bar code, it is enough to show the screen of the smartphone - the bar code is displayed on it.  There is one more possibility to work with a bar code: it‚Äôs enough to bring a laser scanner to the LED and it blinks the required code - this is less convenient, since it‚Äôs usually crowded at the checkout counter and it‚Äôs a long time to explain to the cashier  You can simply show the screen of the smartphone. <br><br>  <b>Difficulties</b> <br><br>  What difficulties may arise?  The first thing you will inevitably encounter is the surprised look of the cashier, who does not understand what card you are transmitting.  After an explanation and verification, there are smiles and joy ‚Äî these are the metamorphoses. <br><br>  The second thing you will encounter is better to check the work at home, since the card remains active for several minutes, and data transfer to it takes from a couple to ten seconds.  (In fact, it takes longer to search the map if there are many active Bluetooth devices around). <br><br>  <b>Security</b> <br><br>  Everyone immediately has a question: Is it possible to clone a bank card?  I answer: you can.  But such a card instead of a bank will immediately cause a lot of questions and most likely you will be asked to pay in cash.  In addition, most of the cards currently being produced are chip-based and, after carrying out a magnetic stripe, the terminal will ask you to use a card chip.  And the card manufacturers themselves do not recommend cloning a bank card, since the issue of storing a clone of a card remains open.  In general, it is better not to joke with money. <br><br>  <b>Bonuses</b> <br><br>  I add that there is a great bonus, which causes even more interest.  The developers have provided the opportunity to exchange bonus cards between friends.  In the contact list, separate labels appear opposite those friends who have already registered the Cardberry application.  You can see a list of their open cards (cards can be opened or left for private use) and ask to use any.  If the user gives the go-ahead, then you have a day to take advantage of the ‚Äúalien‚Äù discount.  We are at the start of the community education, which will exchange discounts and increase the number of bonuses.  How shops will react to this is not yet clear. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion</b> <br>  Using the card was not easy, but very simple.  She replaced almost three dozen cards, which were rolled with me every day for many years just like that, just in case.  Now the purse does not look so plump and attractive for lovers of others, but shopping with two cards - banking and discount - has become much easier.  Well, with the opportunity to share or borrow a discount from friends, you have to struggle with the desire to go shopping. <br>  All the holidays!  Here is the promised video. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YHwIbWdnbLM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <a href="https://dadget.ru/katalog/travel/universalnaya-plastikovaya-karta/%3Futm_referrer%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_term%3Duniversalnaya-plastikovaya-karta%26utm_content%3Duniversalnaya-plastikovaya-karta%26utm_campaign%3Duniversalnaya-plastikovaya-karta_397">You can buy a universal electronic card</a> with a 10% discount on the GEEKT-UK promotional code for 14 days. <br><br>  <b>I was asked to post information for authors:</b> <br><br>  The company "Dadzhet" is interested in publishing independent objective reviews of dadzhetov in various kinds of media.  The company ‚ÄúDjadzhet‚Äù will gladly provide dadzhetov bloggers and authors who want to test them and write a review. <br><br>  The device after writing a review remains with the author.  The company is not trying to tell the author what to write about our product, but asks to show the article before publication.  In this case, it is possible to clarify information and prevent errors.  Whether to consider company comments or not is always up to the discretion of the author.  <a href="https://dadget.ru/cooperation/">Read more ...</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/399975/">https://habr.com/ru/post/399975/</a></p>
