There are even fewer good designers who do not hide the flaws of work behind simple techniques.  Well, there are almost no good designers who understand the specifics of working with the Web, in our wilderness.  I did not have time to get a new job - I already wanted to curse the local designer. <br><br>  Now I will explain why.  Moreover, this business is not even a professional one, almost anyone who wants to make their web page on the web can face this.  If you do not decide to go the easy way of tying up a template for an open source site or, even worse, use the service that has become a bad taste masterpiece narod.ru.

    <a name="habracut"></a>  In general, well, for starters, they gave me a small task for layout.  Bulletin board for this site.  Send me ... a 4 by 3 thousand pixel jpeg.  In this case, with a rather complex graphics.  What the...?  Yes, give me a normal source in PSD!  Yep  The bosses are written off with the designer, and after a few minutes PSD-schnichek appears in my working folder.  One name, not a PSD.  Also 4 by 3 thousand pixels, and, naturally, in one layer.  Where are the normal layers so that I can properly cut the same graphic backgrounds?  How did he do it?  It turned out - the designer is not a Weber at all, he is a printer (and not so hot, but more on that later).  And I drew everything in ... Adobe Illustrator, from which I thoughtlessly (without even thinking about the screen resolution) exported to all other formats!  No, I understand everything, for graphics such graphics is the most, because it can be scaled as you like and printed on anything, it does not depend on the fixed position of the points, but on the drawn geometric figures, their proportions and position.  BUT!  The website itself is tied to the screen, to those points.  And that is why, right now, I will say one rule.  If you make websites not on a vector flash (and there is nothing good in this IMHO), THEN: <br><br><blockquote>  <strong>Design (at worst - give layout) websites ONLY in raster graphics editors!</strong> </blockquote><br><br>  Photoshop taxis.  Yes, at worst, even MS Paint will come down, although without the support of layers it is still sometimes difficult.  And if you are accustomed to drawing in a vector and otherwise you can‚Äôt, well, then at least bother to export normally. <br><br>  Well, okay, they made the designer still suffer.  He sends the next day a kind of layer.  Although the text from the substrates was divided, and that is good.  Another thing is that ALL substrates were merged into one, but this is not gut.  And simple copying-copy-paste will not get off there.  Because these substrates on the page were a complex system of gradients.  Both horizontal and vertical.  Vertical caused me another attack of foul language.  For how else, if not obscene, explain that this is on the print width-height are constant, pervert as you like.  And the height of each web page is different from the rest - for we do only the PATTERN, and how long its content will be is not known in advance.  Correspondingly, the gradient fill extending from the center and stretching to the full width of the page will not work for us.  Similarly, with the filling of individual text blocks, we do not think that they should all be straight, of equal length, right?  Accordingly, here is another rule for you: <br><br><blockquote>  Site is not a static picture!  Before turning around a lot of things, think about how it will look with different content. </blockquote><br><br>  It was a long and tedious struggle to deal with this, because, I repeat, it was all merged into one layer.  I tried to do something about this page, eventually, looking at this pornography, scored.  For starters, I ripped out a small piece from the top of the page, where the substrate was horizontal.  I made this the main background of the html layout that was being edited, and prescribed a fixed height for it for a while, so that just something could be seen ... opened in the browser and made a screenshot.  This screenshot already in Photoshop superimposed a layer copied from the original with column headers (why these graphic headers - I will say further, is also not so hot what solution), and from there began to cut the graphics.  Perversion, right? <br><br>  So, that's why the graphic headers.  In general, to be honest, as a supporter of clear informativeness, speed of loading, and generally like a person who has been sitting on gprs for a long time with images turned off ... I DO NOT LOVE graphic menus, headers and so on.  And I think the menu on flash in the absence of a site map or some other alternative is the height of insanity.  Try to turn off the pictures, and you will understand why.  Much better is a text link, and under it is already some kind of darling graphic substrate.  But no, here the designer freaked out, completely cutting off the very possibility of this.  The fact is that the same font is used for the title of the page, the menu and subtitles (consisting of a picture and a caption).  Completely absent in the standard delivery of any OS.  And therefore, if you prescribe the display of the text in this font, then most users will be shown instead what is not clear.  Yes, it is on the press deeply do not care, but on the Web we still need to take care of users.  In this case, I had to do everything with graphics, prescribing alternative text for pictureless cards.  But still it is pornography, IMHO.  So - one more thing that I recommend to hack on my nose: <br><br><blockquote>  <strong>Do not abuse graphics.</strong> </blockquote><br><br>  Standard fonts are also beautiful, and the search engine will notice the text title rather than the alt to the picture. <br><br>  And further.  Again, if you don‚Äôt make static pages on the people. Ru, which is the day before yesterday, then it‚Äôs time to finally find out that most elements of the web page are generated automatically, and therefore many elements are made on the same model and have a standard layout.  I said STANDARD!  And then on those blocks with graphic headings, which, in theory, should be displayed in one script for one sample, there were also frames.  In one block, the indentation of this frame is 20 pixels, in the other - 15, in the third it is generally incomprehensible where it left.  And since it was organically inscribed in the headings and I somehow did not want to mess around with the alteration, the framework was also removed altogether.  Yes, the headlines, due to the different sizes of the pictures in the text, are also somewhat uneven.  And should I tell the output script that it is in this cell that the position of the content should be changed?  The moral of this story is: <br><br><blockquote>  <strong>Follow the same style.</strong>  <strong>Have pity on automation.</strong> </blockquote><br><br>  And finally learn how to use the ‚Äúalignment‚Äù tool, available in any serious graphic editor. <br><br>  Such a tirade.  Please do not repeat the above errors.  Otherwise it will only reinforce the view that <br><br><blockquote>  <strong>Printers have nothing to do in web design!</strong> </blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/15971/">https://habr.com/ru/post/15971/</a></p>
