  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why is the OneMarkt product tape an effective means for selling online stores?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Let's imagine a typical online store on the Internet or social network.  At its core, this is a showcase where the proposed goods of this store are presented.  The seller as the sales of the old product replenishes the range and makes small promo, like, "We have a new delivery", "Discounts for the old collection", "New buyers discount", etc.  Yes, you can also send a mailing list to all customers of the store and try to return them for another purchase.  And along with all this, the seller makes permanent advertising in search engines and social networks.  Often, all the goods sold can not recoup the cost of advertising online store. <br><br>  OneMarkt solves this problem with the help of Ribbon products on its website. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Each new product added to the storefront of a store is immediately displayed in the feed.  In this case, any buyer not only can go to the page of the most liked product, but also visit the individual site of the store, subscribe to its news, share it in the social network and mark the product as ‚Äúlike‚Äù.  And now let's think about how it can be useful for online stores for participants? 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      First, the Ribbon and the news in it are open not only to the subscribers of this store, but also to all the buyers who have visited the site.  Thus, the seller can not focus on advertising - cheating users in his group in the social network, but directly on the sale of a product.  In addition, in the Ribbon, in addition to downloading a new product, you can download news and photos of an old product, such as a small reminder: ‚ÄúHey, we have another thing!  We offer a discount! ".  Or you can send a text message with information about the ongoing action or discounts. <br><br>  In general, doing 3-4 posts per day in Lenta about his new and old product, the seller will attract the attention of more potential buyers than if he would also do it only for his subscribers in the group.  It is proved that if for some time the buyer sees information about the store, he will certainly go into it and make a purchase.  In the tape your store will always be in sight. <br><br>  There are also impulsive buyers who make a purchase within 10 minutes after they see the product they like.  Scrolling Ribbon, he will be able to see your offer and make a purchase, even if he did not plan to purchase anything. <br><br>  Secondly, there are several buttons in your post in the Ribbon.  These are ‚Äúvisit site‚Äù, ‚ÄúI like‚Äù, ‚Äúsubscribe‚Äù and ‚Äúshare‚Äù.  The first and last button allows you to attract customers to your own website and advertise products in the social network.  "Subscribe" allows customers to maintain their own tape of interesting stores and to keep track of new products, discounts and promotions.  The ‚ÄúLike‚Äù button, in addition to the traditional understanding of product approval or recording, will soon have an additional function that will allow sellers to work with buyers as efficiently as possible.  Stay with us and you will learn all the secrets of the OneMarkt service. <br><br>  OneMarkt helps to significantly reduce the cost of maintaining and maintaining an online store: our sellers do not need to spend money on creating their own website, buying a domain and hosting, hiring employees to maintain the site itself and its promotion.  We allow to concentrate solely on the sale of goods and the promotion of the store itself. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/294996/">https://habr.com/ru/post/294996/</a></p>
