  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Ancient Slavic Calendar</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The ancient Slavic Calendar is based on a hexadecimal number system and forms long periods of time, called Svarog Circles, in each of which the Sun passes all 16 Chaltogges for 180 Circles of Life.  This is the day of Svarog.  (By the way, 180 Circles of Life x 144 Years = 25 920 Years - this is the known period of the orbital revolution of our Yaryla-sun around the center of our galaxy). <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The Circle of Life contains 144 Years.

      Summer - three seasons: Owen, Winter and Spring - this is one Summer (hence the concepts in Russian: chronicle, chronology, how old are you? And so on) <br><br>  Summer - 9 months <br><br>  month - 41 or 40 days (depending on whether it is odd or even), <br><br>  day - 16 hours <br><br>  hour - 144 parts <br><br>  part - 1 296 shares, <br><br>  a share - 72 moments, <br><br>  instant - 760 minutes, <br><br>  The moment - 160 sigov (from here in Russian language ‚Äúsiganut‚Äù, i.e., to move quickly) <br><br>  sig - 14 000 centigs. <br><br>  Such accuracy is unattainable even by modern atomic chronometers. <br><br>  New days of Svarog started earlier at the time of the Yarily-Sun setting on the day of equinox - very simple and visual. <br><br>  Earlier (when there was no widespread use of watches), the new day began with the setting of the Sun. <br><br>  The term "day" appeared a little over 110 thousand years ago.  And the word "day" is only in the Slavic languages.  Neither in English, nor in French, nor in it. Nor in other languages ‚Äã‚Äãthis word is present.  And the etymology of it is simple: comprehend, intercourse - i.e.  connect together (TC).  O - Y - transient vowels.  That is, DAYS - woven, docked together day and night. <br><br>  Now the day begins at night when everyone is asleep.  But even if they didn‚Äôt sleep, it is still impossible to fix the beginning of a new day, because there is nothing to observe at that moment in the sky. <br><br>  The week consisted of nine days: Monday, Tuesday, tritheynik, Thursday, Friday, sixties, seventies, ovitsa and a week.  Recall the phrases from the uncorrected "historians" of fairy tales: "and on the first seven he went to the city of the capital" (Little Humpbacked Horse), "here‚Äôs the octagon already gone and the week has come" (Stone bowl). <br><br>  All months began on strictly certain days of the week.  For example, if the first month of the year begins on Tuesday, then all other odd months will begin on Tuesday, and even even months - on the week of the week.  Therefore, the calendar that we carry with us today and which contains 12 different nameplates for months, used to contain only two nameplates: one for odd months, the other for even ones. <br><br>  All the years of the Circle of Chislobog always began on strictly certain days of the week. <br><br>  Many elements of the Slavic Calendar have reached our days in the form of sayings and customs, the sources of which, unfortunately, have already been forgotten.  For example, the Great Trizna, that is, the commemoration of a deceased relative, takes place in a week (9 days) and in a month (40 days), that is, on the ninth and fortieth day. <br><br>  For seven months the mother bears a child in her womb and forty-forty (forty months) then feeds it with breast milk. <br><br>  And after forty-forty (or four summers and four months) after the birth of the first child in women, there comes a period of life improvement, as a result of which she becomes the Knowing Mother or the Aftermath. <br><br>  369 weeks after the birth of man, the period of his Spiritual Education begins, for in nine years the first Great communion with the Ancient Wisdom of the Gods and Ancestors takes place. <br><br>  When children from Slavic clans turned 12 years old (108 months) and they reached a height of 7 spans in their foreheads (124 cm), a new stage in their life began for children.  A person comes of age at the age of 108 months (or at the age of 12), and he undergo the rites of the age of majority and the naming convention, after which the boys begin to be taught generic crafts and martial arts. <br><br>  And after 108 months, that is, in the 24th summer, he, accepting the Spiritual Sanctification by the Sacred Fire, will know the true meaning of being of his Kind and the true meaning of the Generic Name. <br><br>  In 33 years, the time of spiritual development comes. <br><br>  And in 369 months or in 41 years, the era of Spiritual Illumination begins. <br><br>  A girl could marry only after 16 years or 144 months, which is the Single Circle of the Circle.  Until that time, she is in charge - she knows the Message, that is, she is trained in housekeeping, taking care of children, needlework, and at the age of 16 she finishes reporting and becomes a bride. <br><br>  The widespread use of the ancient Slavic Calendar ceased, unfortunately, when Peter I introduced a foreign calendar. <br><br>  Accordingly, the modern calendar was complicated in favor of political interests. <br><br>  The week was shortened to seven days, in favor of fans of the moon cult.  The number of months in the year has increased and their names have changed. <br><br>  Currently, if we use the modern calendar, then it would be more correct to apply it only for the events of the last three hundred years.  And more ancient events, for a clear understanding of their essence, should be dated in the system of chronology, which was used until 1700.  Otherwise, misinterpretation of our chronicle, culture, traditions and customs is possible. <br><br>  ____________________ <br>  I could not find the author </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/14856/">https://habr.com/ru/post/14856/</a></p>
