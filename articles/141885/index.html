  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The perfect Android player for non-music</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  When I tried to find a player in which it would be convenient for me to listen to podcasts, audiobooks and similar things, I tried at least a dozen two or three applications both from the top of the music category and from the last pages of search results for various crazy combinations of keywords. <br><br>  At that time, I did not consider special podcast players, as I wanted a universal solution for all audio content.  Later I looked at several specialized applications, but in no one did I like the organization of the download process.  Personally, it is more convenient for me to download everything from the desktop and throw it on the phone through the cord, which means there are no problems in order to listen to everything through one program. <br><br>  So here.  All tested players were divided into three categories: <br>  1. The most extensive.  Players who believe that everyone listens to music exclusively in albums.  Provide no opportunity to play directories.  A catalog with 100-200 songs of various artists turns the catalog of music of such programs into a tape that goes to infinity, where nothing can be found.  The playback position, as a rule, is not saved, but everything is very beautiful. <br>  2. Players that allow listening to catalogs and / or listening-oriented audiobooks.  If in the previous category all applications differed only in icons, and the general ideology of the interface was about the same, then there are no similarities here, but there are a lot of unique ideas, sometimes to the point of delusion.  In some applications, books must be imported, otherwise they will not see them.  Some of them show and sort files only by tags, but we know very well what kind of mess there is in audiobook tags, right?  In general, in each program, something did not suit me, and in some places frankly enraged.  In addition, every second of these programs (as a rule, the most original ones in terms of the interface) suffered from a severe decline. <br>  3. <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dde.zorillasoft.musicfolderplayer">Music Folder Player Free</a>

I know, I know, I am in the minority here, but personally it is much more convenient for me. </li><li>  Memorization of the current file and position in it in each directory.  That is, you can throw the book, go listen to the podcast, then throw the podcast, go listen to the music, then close everything altogether, and then continue any of the three from the same place where you left off.  And all this with a sufficiently small interval is stored in a separate file in each directory and even if the phone hangs, the position is not lost - the restoration of the position occurs with a bounce back seconds to 5-10, and it is saved more often.  You won't believe it, but <i>most</i> audiobook players during the test for abnormal program termination during playback lost not only the position, but also the current file, and the book and everything. </li><li>  Protection from accidentally poking at another time in the slider or moving to the next file: after such actions, the ‚Äúprevious file‚Äù button becomes ‚Äúundo‚Äù and allows you to return to the position from which the jump was made. </li><li>  4 buttons with which you can jump on the current file.  Each is adjusted to the direction and interval (either in seconds or in percent) of the jump, the selected values ‚Äã‚Äãare then visible on the buttons themselves.  Yes, by the way, these buttons and slider are not visible by default, they need to be added from the menu. </li><li>  You can select one or more directories in which the player will search for music.  No more left-handed mp3s scattering in the catalogs of installed games!  :) </li><li>  There is a small, but useful feature: stop playing when pulling out the headphones. </li><li>  In case of any other audio activity (voice prompts of the navigator, SMS notifications, incoming call, finally), the playback is paused, at the end of extraneous sounds resumes.  Obvious, it would seem a thing, but some other candidates did not know how. </li><li>  Stability.  Sometimes MIUI begins to sausage and everything at my moments falls from everything from basic system services to individual applications.  FBReader starts and immediately crashes, Google Play does not crash right away, but after a little thinking, Wi-Fi does not turn on at all, messages that google apps, google framework, etc. have crashed once a minute.  Music Folder Player in these conditions is launched, it works fine, does not fall, it is controlled both from the screen and from the headset, as if nothing is happening around it.  The last time it was so bad that I could not run anything at all but him.  And, you know, I listened for one and a half hours ‚Äúwithout breaks‚Äù until I reached home and there was time to reanimate the phone.  No, I'm lying.  There is another program that runs and does not crash.  This is MIUI Backup.  Convenient, right?  :) </li></ul><br>  <b>Disadvantages:</b> <br><ul><li>  No speed control playback.  Some texts are well-read so unhurriedly that on other devices I increased the speed sometimes as much as 2x, and 1.25x or 1.5x were generally common. </li><li>  There is no directory hierarchy.  Those.  If you are used to carrying your entire music collection with you, this player is definitely not for you.  For me, this is not a drawback, I cite solely for the sake of objectivity :) </li><li>  After interrupting listening to a telephone conversation, the application loses its association with the control from the headset: if after a call to press the headset button, either nothing happens or a regular audio player from MIUI starts playing and a random mp3 starts to play.  Unfortunately, Music Folder Player cannot be set as the default audio player in the system settings, but even changing the default player to the third player didn‚Äôt affect anything: for some reason, it‚Äôs still a regular one.  This is what infuriates the most.  Hope to fix it sooner or later.  There have already been allegations in the changelog about correcting this bug, but nothing has changed for me personally. </li><li>  The design is rather austere, but not disgusting.  I have a complicated attitude to design: sometimes I can use the most terrible program, respecting it for functionality, and sometimes after just one look I don‚Äôt want to understand the functionality :) I definitely endure the design of this player, maybe because there is no design No, just a set of buttons :) </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/141885/">https://habr.com/ru/post/141885/</a></p>
