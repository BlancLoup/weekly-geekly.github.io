However, if you want to call a taxi, you will have to use it.  And it‚Äôs good if you know the numbers of a couple-three checked taxi companies, but during rush hour it may not work, moreover, you can‚Äôt get away from a conversation with the dispatcher - and here again: the address, destination, repeat, hard to hear, how much will come, how much it costs and so on.  Fortunately, there are mobile technologies that are already in a hurry to save us from such inconveniences. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Not a telephone or even a call </h4><br>  Thus, in Moscow over the past six months, several applications for smartphones have appeared, developing the direction of ordering a taxi with one touch.  The following of them work today: inTaxi, Yandex.Taxi, Wheely and GetTaxi.  The first three are aggregators with a set of convenient features, that is, already existing tax fleets are connected to their system, and your order is redirected to them.  The third is essentially the same taxis, only with a fundamentally new ordering system and even more features.  However, something in this diversity is still not enough.  What exactly - does not immediately catch the eye, so we decided to dig a little deeper and that is what we came to. <br><br> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.jettaxi"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4d1/447/e97/4d1447e97aa240afafc7585539920ca1.png"></a> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.jettaxi"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bd0/14f/194/bd014f1946b0de7d56ecd3bd88d879f8.png"></a>

    <br><h4>  But </h4><br> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.jettaxi"><img align="right" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/573/e8e/a3a/573e8ea3a2d0e9630aa061cb33b1bda0.png"></a> <br>  <i>‚ÄúVery simple,‚Äù said the elder.</i>  <i>- You, apparently, never had to come into contact with our offices.</i>  <i>Any such contact is only apparent.</i>  <i>To you, because of the ignorance of all our affairs, it seems to be something real. ‚Äù</i> <br><br>  The driver, as the direct supplier of the service, is still separated from the passenger by the offices, which, among other things, contribute to the existing mutual misunderstanding (although in reality it is only apparent).  Despite the fact that now the movement of the designated taxi driver can be seen on the map, and the rating system may make him smiling and more helpful, he cannot express himself as an individual market player.  All right, after these words, it remains only to go and create a society for the protection of taxi drivers.  )) <br><br><br clear="all"><h4>  Here is </h4><br> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.jettaxi"><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fe3/9f4/dda/fe39f4ddaedc90af914a914f3a1a108d.png"></a> <br>  In fact, it is not about glorifying taxi drivers, but about elementary balance.  Of course, when we, for example, come to the store, we think that we have predominantly rights, while sellers have only duties in general.  Moreover, this scheme even sometimes works, and we get an acceptable quality of service, but, in my opinion, it is seeming.  After all, there is another shopping scheme in the store - ebay.com - here everyone can be both a seller and a buyer, without changing the account.  Everyone is equal, and the interaction takes place at a completely different level - more naturally, if something - while both sides win.  Yes, the rating system is also present here and even plays a fundamental role, but this is not the same rating system as in corporations, when after visiting the sales office you receive an SMS asking you to evaluate the quality of service of this or that employee. <br><br><br clear="all"><br><h4>  From Prelude to Fugue </h4><br>  Finally, we got to <a href="http://jettaxi.mobi/">Taxi Jet</a> , a mobile app for Android and iOS, which connects the nearest taxi drivers and passengers directly.  We decided not to reinvent the wheel, but to try to organize a peer-to-peer taxi market like Ebay or Airbnb, so the application has two modes - ‚ÄúPassenger‚Äù and ‚ÄúDriver‚Äù.  In this case, all the convenient features of course present.  We list them in thesis form. <br><br>  Features of the "Passenger" mode: <br><ul><li>  The address is determined automatically. </li><li>  All available taxis are displayed on the map. </li><li>  The passenger himself chooses the driver depending on the fare, individual rating and distance.  Also available are his photo and car model. </li><li>  After ordering, you can track the driver's movements in real time on the map. </li><li>  The cost of the trip is calculated according to GPS taximeter. </li></ul><br><br>  Features of the "Driver": <br><ul><li>  Receive orders directly from passengers. </li><li>  Setting your own fare. </li><li>  Interactive map shows where the clusters of potential passengers. </li><li>  For each incoming order, the client‚Äôs location on the map and its rating is displayed. </li><li>  Instant notification of a new order is like a phone call - you just need to accept or reject it. </li></ul><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/AuAkuRdwepA%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhiPAuy_RivaOmhO0gAgbki0ldu4AQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h4>  Important </h4><br> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.jettaxi"><img align="right" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d27/0b2/385/d270b2385fb8bdab34f7a38966ea31d7.png"></a> <br>  Now the application is in beta test.  Registration is completely free - each driver receives 3,000 welcome rubles, which is enough for 2 months.  During this period, there may be no drivers or passengers near you, but do not despair, we are working on attracting users, and everyone who registers can help us in this, and the most active participants will be rewarded.  Details on our website: <a href="http://jettaxi.mobi/promo">http://jettaxi.mobi/promo</a> <br><br>  Your opinion and suggestions that you can leave on our mini-forum in the technical section are very important for us.  support <a href="https://jettaxiru.uservoice.com/">https://jettaxiru.uservoice.com/</a> <br><br>  The ideas with the most votes will be implemented. <br><br clear="all"><h4>  Now and then </h4><br>  It remains to talk about some of the unlisted features.  The application works wherever there is a Google map, but in the very near future we plan to switch to OpenStreetMap.  <a href="http://jettaxi.mobi/ios/subscribe">The iOS version is</a> completely ready, but the moderators from Cupertino unpleasantly "surprised" the presence of Qiwi and PayPal payment systems in the application.  Already altered and are waiting for approval this week.  Work on a version for <a href="http://jettaxi.mobi/wp/subscribe">Windows Phone 7 has</a> also begun.  Anticipating questions about the legitimacy of taxi drivers, I will say that for now every user can try himself as a driver, but at the end of the beta test an authentication mechanism will be introduced.  By the way, another important plan for the future is the "legalization of bombing".  The fact is that illegal passenger transportation still accounts for a huge market share, while its uselessness is often repelled by the use of people‚Äôs licenses due to taxpayers and dispatching offices.  If we manage to help at least some of the drivers work according to the law, well, it will be great. <br><br><h4>  Da capo al fine </h4><br>  <i>In the Castle, as I was told, the phone seemed to work fine, they constantly call there, which, of course, greatly speeds up the work.</i>  <i>These uninterrupted telephone conversations reach us on the local apparatus in the form of noise and</i> <i><br></i>  <i>singing, you probably heard it too.</i>  <i>So, the only thing you can believe is noise and singing, they are real, and everything else is a deception.</i> <br><br>  <a href="https://jettaxiru.uservoice.com/">Support Service</a> |  <a href="http://jettaxi.mobi/">Website</a> |  <a href="http://jettaxi.mobi/">Competition</a> |  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.jettaxi%26referrer%3Dutm_source%253Dhabrahabr%2526utm_medium%253Darticle%2526utm_campaign%253Dhabrahabr1">Android App</a> | <br>  <a href="http://jettaxi.mobi/ios/subscribe">IPhone / iPad App</a> |  <a href="http://jettaxi.mobi/wp/subscribe">Application for Windows Phone</a> |  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/jettaxiapp">Facebook</a> |  <a href="http://vk.com/jettaxiapp">VK</a> |  <a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> <br><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e86/068/fa3/e86068fa38ad8dd7edbb9e567331f99b.png"></div></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/139846/">https://habr.com/ru/post/139846/</a></p>
