  <section class="page js-page"><h1>We write for UEFI BIOS in Visual Studio. Part 1 - Deploying the development environment, compiling and running to debug</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h3>  Introduction </h3><br>  This article will describe how to quickly start programming for <b>UEFI</b> in the <a href="http://www.tianocore.org/">edk2</a> framework in <b>Visual Studio</b> without spending a lot of time setting up the environment in the usual way, using the original manuals.  It is enough to give the <b>git clone</b> command <b>...</b> in the root directory of the disk, and this is actually all, the environment will be fully installed and ready to go.  Requires 64-bit <b>Windows 7</b> and higher with <b>Visual Studio 2008-2015</b> .  These two conditions are not obligatory, but then you have to work a little to <b>assemble the edk2</b> system - <b>Visual Studio</b> as a whole, a brief memo will be given. <br><br>  The purpose of the article is to lead the beginner by the hand on the first <b>UEFI</b> project, remaining in his familiar environment.  For more experienced people, I hope it will be interesting to work in <b>VS</b> instead of the usual command line, or to disassemble the approach and transfer it to your favorite <b>Eclipse</b> . <br><br>  Let's start with simple things, output the string to the console and Russify (a pretty demanded thing, and simple to implement), then there will be work with forms in <b>HII</b> (what was commonly called <b>BIOS Setup</b> pages), then graphics, then <b>Boot Manager</b> , and then It will be seen (s).

We will spend half a page on this at the start, so as not to waste half a day and at the end understand that you need something completely different.  Or, I hope, on the contrary - to catch fire with enthusiasm and find time to read the article. <br><br><h4>  Good at first </h4><br>  1) Hardware is not needed from the word at all.  No <a href="https://minnowboard.org/">Evaluation Boards</a> , no <a href="https://designintools.intel.com/product_p/itpxdp3brext.htm">Intel BlueBox JTAG</a> for $ 3000.  Everything will be debugged in a 32-bit <b>OVMF</b> virtual machine - <b>Intel</b> 's ported <b>qemu</b> virtual machine for debugging <b>UEFI Firmware</b> .  To recompile for a real platform, then after debugging it‚Äôs enough to rearrange a pair of keys in the compilation settings, and that‚Äôs it. <br><br>  2) We will work with all the capabilities of <b>Visual Studio</b> , i.e.  breakpoints, watch, step execution and the rest are available.  Recompiling and running a simple module takes 8-10 seconds. <br><br>  3) The virtual file system is available on a Windows machine for write-read.  It is very useful if you need to edit the <b>UEFI Shel</b> l scripts, after launching to see screenshots and analyze logs using Windows. <br><br>  4) No <b>assembler</b> , only <b>C / C ++</b> . <br><br><h4>  Now that we will not do </h4><br>  1) We will work in <b>DXE</b> (where there is already a <a href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/uefi-shell">UEFI Shell</a> ) and late phases.  We won't get into earlier phases, since nobody will let us in there, at least for Intel processors.  Later there will be an explanation of why.  If you want to make a full cycle, from switching on to OS loading, and quickly and without scoring a bunch of unnecessary and uninteresting information at the moment, you don‚Äôt need to manually configure the system at all - don‚Äôt read further, and type in <b>"coreboot"</b> in Google. <br><br>  2) "Graphic" UEFI with a mouse and buttons, like Dell, MSI and others, will not be here.  These are paid environments for use in large companies.  There are, of course, enthusiasts who create them themselves with their own hands, without first answering the question ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù, But usually their enthusiasm ends on the second form with buttons. <br><br>  3) We will work with the <b>Visual Studio</b> compiler.  Those interested can set up <b>gcc</b> in <b>cygwin</b> , or <b>icc</b> , but at the moment it‚Äôs not a task to get the optimal fast code, but it‚Äôs a task to quickly go to the beginning of full-fledged work. <br><br>  All, the preliminary dances are over, who is necessary - inspired, who is necessary - scared. <br><br><h3>  Getting down to business </h3><br>  First of all, download the repository to the root of the disk.  It will turn in <b>with: / FW</b> .  If the FW directory in the root of the disk already exists, then it would be better to rename it, because all configs are configured exactly in absolute paths.  Not according to Feng Shui, but perfectionists can always correct absolute relative paths by writing the corresponding script that does this. <br><br>  So, whoever has <b>git</b> on the command line on the machine, executes the command in the <b>cmd window</b> (or in <b>Far Commander</b> , not the essence) from the root directory: <br><br> <code>git clone https://github.com/ProgrammingInUEFI/FW</code> <br> <br>  and those who do not, follow the link to <b>github</b> , download the zip-file and open it in the directory <b>with: / FW</b> . <br><br>  As previously promised, we give a hint from the Intel training on the use of a different configuration, different from that indicated at the beginning of the article.  Look for your combination in the plate, if the proposed for some reason does not fit: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/fc9/2dc/aa3/fc92dcaa3a8344f68c6a4fcaefbba4e8.png"><br><br><h4>  Configuring the environment for a version other than VS2010 </h4><br>  Open the file <b>c: \ FW \ edk2 \ Conf \ target.txt</b> and in the line <br> <code>TOOL_CHAIN_TAG = VS2010x86</code> <br> <br>  Replace <b>VS2010x86</b> with the tag of the version of <b>Visual Studio</b> you have installed.  For <b>Visual Studio 2010, the</b> tag will remain as it is, for other versions of VS - see the picture above, or the list at the beginning of the file <b>c: \ FW \ edk2 \ Conf \ tools_def.txt</b> <br><br>  Actually, the <b>edk2</b> development environment is <b>fully</b> deployed and you can work from the command line.  Some people work all their lives (‚Äúto steal from hardcore, maintain the spirit of the old school and all that‚Äù - (c) CodeRush in its <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/274463/">classic article</a> ).  But we still go further, to transfer a person from MSVS back to the command line is inhumane, especially in 2017. <br><br><h3>  We configure the project in the Visual Studio </h3><br>  Open <b>Visual Studio</b> , open <b>Solution NT32.sln in it</b> from the directory <b>C: \ FW \ VS \ NT32</b> .  In order to reduce the time of entry into the theme, the solution has already created the <b>NT32</b> project of the same name, in which the settings described below have already been made.  This is if you fail to create it yourself - in order to have guaranteed working project settings.  This approach will greatly reduce the time to search for the source of problems, if they occur.  Nevertheless, it is better to go through the path described below, and to understand the meaning of the settings - this will make it easier to set up the following projects. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">A little advice for those who caught fire seriously</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  It will be useful to set up the working directory on <b>c: \ FW \ VS</b> in <b>Tools-&gt; Options</b> right away, but if another working project is being run in VS, then you don‚Äôt need to do so: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/5e7/1d8/139/5e71d813959748f28e01a427c2a11356.png"><br></div></div><br>  So, in steps: <br><br><h3>  Project creation </h3><br>  Create a new project for <b>Visual C ++</b> in <b>Solution NT32</b> (right- <b>click</b> on <b>Solution NT32, Add-&gt; New Project</b> , select the <b>Makefile Project</b> option), and call it <b>MyFirstUEFIProject</b> (or anything else).  Click <b>Finish</b> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/693/845/b7c/693845b7ca984489a0d6027accb5ccef.png"><br><br>  Select the <b>NT32</b> project in the <b>Solution</b> , select <b>Project-&gt; Properties</b> from the context menu and make project settings. <br><br><h3>  Setting NMake Options </h3><br>  In the window on the left, select the line <b>Configurarion Properties ‚Üí NMake</b> , in the window on the right - the line <b>Build Command Line</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/3e0/2a7/6ea/3e02a76ea14f4f6db071520323f8a061.png"><br><br>  Click <b>Edit ...</b> and in the opened text box we enter: <br><br><pre> <code class="dos hljs"><span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">set</span></span> NASM_PREFIX=C:\FW\NASM\ <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">call</span></span> c:\FW\edk2\edksetup.bat --nt32 build</code> </pre> <br>  Now it is worth explaining a little what we do.  In fact, we are writing in this window a regular batch bat file instead of a makefile. <br><br>  The first line sets the <b>NASM_PREFIX</b> assembler environment variable as understood by <b>edk2</b> , that is, the path that the <b>nasm.exe</b> file lies on.  We will not write on the assembler ourselves, but our assembly system needs an assembler. <br><br>  The second line calls the <b>edk2</b> environment settings script and sets up environment variables for this compilation and launch session (these variables are not reflected outside VS).  The <b>‚Äìnt32 switch</b> tells the build system to compile the sources for the <b>Nt32Pkg</b> package, located in <b>C: \ FW \ edk2 \ Nt32Pkg</b> .  There are many packages there, we will consider them, but not now. <br><br>  In the third line, we give the command to compile in the newly configured environment ( <b>build.exe</b> is in <b>C: \ FW \ edk2 \ BaseTools \ Bin \ Win32</b> , this path is <b>written</b> in the previous line, in <b>edksetup.bat</b> ) <br><br>  So, this is what we should have in the <b>Build Command Line</b> text box: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/209/5c0/2ba/2095c02badad459ca5ad3ddee74483b6.png"><br><br>  Then, in the next line, enter the <b>Rebuild Command Line</b> in the window that opened under <b>Edit ...</b> window <br><br><pre> <code class="dos hljs"><span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">set</span></span> NASM_PREFIX=C:\FW\NASM\ <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">call</span></span> c:\FW\edk2\edksetup.bat --nt32 build clean build</code> </pre> <br>  The <b>build clean</b> command means the very thing that you assume.  It makes a complete restructuring of the project with recompilation of all modules. <br><br>  What we enter in the window from <b>Clean Command Line</b> , probably, everyone already guessed: <br><br><pre> <code class="dos hljs"><span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">set</span></span> NASM_PREFIX=C:\FW\NASM\ <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">call</span></span> c:\FW\edk2\edksetup.bat --nt32 build clean</code> </pre> <br>  Honestly, this option is not needed, in 99% of cases <b>Rebuild</b> will be enough, but let it be - for example, clear the environment to transfer it to another place or upload it to github. <br>  As a result, we should have this window: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/8ff/f55/461/8fff5546183d48b7bca31d098833e051.png"><br><br>  All with <b>NMake</b> setup. <br><br><h3>  Debugging option setting </h3><br>  So, open the <b>Debugging</b> line and enter: <br>  In the <b>Command</b> line: <br><br><pre> <code class="dos hljs"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-function">C:\</span><span class="hljs-title"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">FW</span></span></span><span class="hljs-function">\</span><span class="hljs-title"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">edk2</span></span></span><span class="hljs-function">\</span><span class="hljs-title"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">Build</span></span></span><span class="hljs-function">\</span><span class="hljs-title"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">NT32IA32</span></span></span><span class="hljs-function">\</span><span class="hljs-title"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">DEBUG_VS2010x86</span></span></span><span class="hljs-function">\</span><span class="hljs-title"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">IA32</span></span></span><span class="hljs-function">\</span><span class="hljs-title"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">SecMain.exe</span></span></span></span></code> </pre> <br>  In the line <b>‚ÄúWorking Directory‚Äù</b> : <br><br><pre> <code class="dos hljs"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-function">C:\</span><span class="hljs-title"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">FW</span></span></span><span class="hljs-function">\</span><span class="hljs-title"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">edk2</span></span></span><span class="hljs-function">\</span><span class="hljs-title"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">Build</span></span></span><span class="hljs-function">\</span><span class="hljs-title"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">NT32IA32</span></span></span><span class="hljs-function">\</span><span class="hljs-title"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">DEBUG_VS2010x86</span></span></span><span class="hljs-function">\</span><span class="hljs-title"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">IA32</span></span></span><span class="hljs-function">\</span></span></code> </pre> <br>  A couple of comments: <br><br>  <b>SecMain.exe</b> - to explain now what it is - for a long time, if very briefly and simplified - then this is an analogue of the bootloader, which runs everything else. <br><br>  Working directory - all successfully created modules will be placed here, and they will be accessible all at once from the command line. <br><br>  So, this is what we should get after the settings in this window: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/206/896/438/206896438d0a41f99a2808f7c173cd5b.png"><br><br>  That's all with the project settings. <br><br><h3>  Build the project </h3><br>  Call <b>Build Solution</b> , look at the screen for about a minute, during which there is the greatest risk of being cursed by the compiler, and go to drink coffee - it will all be created 10-15 minutes, depending on the resources of your computer.  Nothing boring is forever, and in the end we get the message: <br><br> <code>========== Build: 1 succeeded, 0 failed, 0 up-to-date, 0 skipped ==========</code> <br> <br>  If instead something else is obtained, see if you have completed all the steps correctly.  The worst case is to get: <br><br> <code>LINK : fatal error LNK1123: failure during conversion to COFF: file invalid or corrupt</code> <br> <br>  This is a VS2010 environment bug and means that VS2010 is installed without SP1.  Put SP1, or look for ways to plug this error in the internet. <br><br>  If you got an error and it is not clear from the compiler messages what it is - rearrange the default project on <b>NT32</b> and run it for compilation with debugging.  If there is an error, check <b>TOOL_CHAIN_TAG for the</b> predefined values ‚Äã‚Äãdescribed in <b>tools_def.txt</b> .  Nothing else can rest there, except that Visual Studio itself is installed, hmm, not quite standard, or it uses a third-party compiler. <br><br><h3>  Jobs at UEFI Shell </h3><br>  So, everything compiled well, and you read these lines.  Now click on your favorite <b>F5</b> and after about a minute of working with the disk (we will shorten this time later) we get the following picture: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/7e4/1f2/771/7e41f277196c4de382d4319e1faffff5.png"><br><br>  Actually, this is the <b>UEFI Shell</b> .  How to work in it - a lot of manuals are written, take a look at Google, but for now we will do a few things in it. <br><br>  1. We look that we compiled there for these 10 minutes.  <b>Enter fs0:</b> ( <b>UEFI Shell</b> is case-insensitive) and then <b>ls ‚Äìb</b> , where the <b>‚Äìb</b> option means waiting for Enter to scroll the page, because the list is large, not on a single screen. <br><br>  Now it became clear what the <b>‚ÄúWorking Directory‚Äù</b> parameter in the Visual Studio project option settings meant - <b>C: \ FW \ edk2 \ Build \ NT32IA32 \ DEBUG_VS2010x86 \ IA32 \</b> .  There is the same list of files, and it is better to watch it (and edit scripts) through the developed <b>Far Commander</b> (or <b>Total Commander</b> ) shell than from the command line in the <b>UEFI Shell</b> . <br><br>  2. In <b>UEFI Shell</b> and type ‚Äúhel‚Äù, press Tab and see <b>Helloworld.efi</b> on the screen.  Not that we had no idea what would happen if you press Enter after that, but you need to check!  Click and get three times <b>UEFI Hello World!</b>  .  The number of repetitions is an external parameter configurable in the environment settings (and not in the source code), and we will analyze this configuration later. <br><br>  3. Type <b>exit</b> and get into our favorite and familiar window: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/f89/7fb/3a7/f897fb3a7ccd492e86b21d2d42ff7ced.png"><br><br>  Well, you can admire the fruits of their labors.  After that, the arrows drive the focus to the <b>Reset</b> and the virtual machine closes, returning us to the familiar MSVC window. <br><br><h3>  Print our string </h3><br>  Creating your application completely will require quite a lot of settings, which will be better considered in the next article - otherwise you will get a large amount, and no one will read long sheets.  However, ‚ÄúProgramming‚Äù is written in the title of this article, but for the time being we were only engaged in tuning.  To keep the promise, let's make a very simple modification of the <b>HelloWorld</b> application in this article using its existing set of files, and in the next article we will create our own, using the Intel <b>UEFI Driver Wizard</b> utility, since we can run beginners through the full cycle of creating a set of files for the UEFI driver ( applications) is nonhuman, wildly routine and bears the risk of losing 90% of the audience.  If a person hooks - he will come to this with time, and if you just want to play, it makes no sense to spend a lot of time on it, since much has already been done automatically through the <b>UEFI Driver Wizard</b> , and feng shui, which is naive to expect from a beginner. <br><br>  So, open the file in <b>Visual Studio</b> <br> <code>C:\FW\edk2\MdeModulePkg\Application\HelloWorld\HelloWorld.c</code> <br> <br>  And we will add our simple line immediately after the declaration of variables in a single function: <br><br><pre> <code class="cpp hljs">Print (<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">L"I did it in UEFI!\r\n"</span></span>);</code> </pre> <br>  Of course, the text can be replaced by anything, only in English letters - the Russian font <b>edk2</b> still does not understand, we will add it in the following articles.  You can put an ordinary breakpoint on this line and see how Visual Studio behaves. <br><br>  Click <b>F5</b> , after compiling and eliminating errors, enter <b>‚Äúfs0:‚Äù</b> , <b>HelloWorld.efi</b> and get the following output: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/e83/ca1/b1b/e83ca1b1bb4143119c9bf12b5dffc7fa.png"><br><br>  That's all.  In the next article, we will work a little bit in <b>UEFI Shell</b> to get the hang of it, and analyze a bit of theory. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/338264/">https://habr.com/ru/post/338264/</a></p>
