I understand, it‚Äôs boring, sad and not interesting to talk about this topic, but if it‚Äôs hard to answer for yourself, look at the old people - at least your grandparents, what are they doing now?  What does this question have to do with technology? <br><br>  IT companies are constantly inventing something, developing, promoting technology to the masses, qualitatively improving our lives, and this is good.  But a whole group of people, albeit <a href="http://www.gks.ru/wps/wcm/connect/rosstat_main/rosstat/ru/statistics/population/generation/">not the largest audience of</a> potential users, remain "behind the board" of progress.  Why? <br><br>  Meanwhile, they, in part of their mass, are the target audience, but only because of their age they are completely unsuitable for enjoying all the benefits of civilization. <a name="habracut"></a>

    <h5>  My example </h5><br>  Grandmother lives in the town of Z, L-region.  My work, family (husband, child), as well as all worldly vanity, do not allow to visit her more than twice a month.  The phone solves the problem of communication.  Thanks to those companies that, in their assortment, continue to keep non-prompt devices with a monochrome display and huge buttons with outstanding numbers in them.  We call up.  But the possibilities are not limited to this!  You just need to take the time to a loved one to explain the work of some Internet services, without sending your grandmother to ‚ÄúGrandma Online‚Äù, which, by the way, also needs to be told how to log in and how to use the service. <br><br><h5>  What was done </h5><br>  Initially, all possible options for how to bring grandmother to the life of our family were identified.  Immediately, I note that she does not want to move in with us, she is physically strong, healthy, ttt, normal, so for now she lives about 25-30 kilometers from us. <br><br>  This is the only person on Earth who sincerely delights our latest photos from Thailand or from anywhere, but not to print the whole of 100,500 frames for this.  First, the problem was solved with a flash drive - you download, take it with you, and then, on the spot, you drop it into a folder on the desktop of her computer.  But sometimes you forget about a flash drive, so you set up a dropbox with a shared folder, where you periodically drop something new to view.  How to look - explained simply. <br><br>  Another grandmother likes to watch movies, though not soap operas, but modern films of this kind, as well as classic films.  Ivi.ru helps you in this respect.  They set up an account, logged in with remembering passwords in the browser, replenished Grandma's account and, when she has a need, she watches movies there.  In the summer the least: a vegetable garden, a goat, chickens ‚Äî all this, naturally, takes a lot of time, although it keeps a very small farm, really only for oneself and for pleasure.  In the winter - more often.  The interface is simple, but there were some problems with using it. <br><br>  Thanks to these ‚Äúrural‚Äù interests, Grandma, including herself, is exploring the open spaces of the network in the part where they have pages of gardening and gardening websites.  Her information is periodically shocked, which is available on some resources, the so-called farms of articles created for earnings on adsens / YAN.  What kind of tips there are sometimes not published, alas.  For the convenience of using the sites, three lectures with practical exercises were held: what is a browser, how does it work - how to find sites that you need to go to in order to avoid advertising, how to distinguish between TOS and SDL.  But I, of course, write it this way; with these words, I explained it to my grandmother in other words.  In addition, a step-by-step memo of actions was drawn up, which was periodically supplemented with new items, and then was transformed into infographics on a notebook sheet, after about three months of my grandmother's active use of the Internet. <br><br><h5>  What can not be done </h5><br>  Maybe it is not impossible, it‚Äôs just not necessary for the grandmother - look at what is happening with the computer system, install or remove any programs.  If only because we come to the village not so rarely, to solve the problems that arise and to make the necessary service work with the equipment, plus, we have found a fellow computer programmer who can quickly help the granny for an adequate, literally symbolic fee-gratitude.  He genuinely surprises how we were able to explain to a man born in 1937 how the Internet works, while he told his mother two times younger than our grandmother in age, told a couple of months how an inexpensive touch smartphone works, which he presented to her birthday. <br><br>  Here is a story.  And how do you solve the problem of introducing the older generation to the achievements of information progress? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/236891/">https://habr.com/ru/post/236891/</a></p>
