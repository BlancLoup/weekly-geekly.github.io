  <section class="page js-page"><h1>A little about the conference Microsoft TechEd 2012</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In this article, I would like to share my impressions of the Microsoft TechEd technology conference on November 27-28.  Just want to say that the reports on Lync, Exchange, Dynamics and InfoSec were not considered in this article. <br>  The plenary speech was opened by Nikolai Pryanishnikov, President of Microsoft Rus, who in his report focused on the arrival of a new era of cloud technologies and cloud services. In turn, Steve Balmer spoke on the arrival of this new golden era of cloud solutions for companies, developers and customers.  Next was the speech of Kirill Tatarinov, President of Business Solutions, he highlighted the universal interfaces that allow the same type of control of various devices on Microsoft platforms that do not require additional training.  Another new trend is the ‚Äúbig data‚Äù of SQL Azure, data that is processed in the cloud, and of course <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/159895/">‚ÄúCloud Compute‚Äù, ‚ÄúBig Compute‚Äù</a> .  Also, a single system of authentication was highlighted, which allows you to manage subscriptions, CRM-online and Office 365. Winter Olympic Games, which will be held in Sochi, will also be based on all the main products of the company.  Then Cyril continued his report on Microsoft Dynamics.  After the demonstration of Dynamics CRM, Scott Guthrie, corporate vice president of Microsoft Azure, appears on the scene, emphasizing the main advantage of Windows 8, which is integrated with work in the cloud.  The demonstration of Windows 8 was held by Mikhail Cheronomordikov - the head of the group of experts. <br>  On the features of software development was the report of Stas Pavlov - an expert on strategic technologies.  There was a demonstration of the development of the corporate application "Advance Reports" in Visual Studio 2012. Next, Mikhail Cheronomordikov spoke a little about the devices on WP8.  Then there were presentations on Office 2013, SharePoint2012 and Office365, Windows 2012. At the end of the plenary speech, Scott Guthrie gave a detailed demonstration of the Windows Azure cloud platform. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a04/625/460/a04625460022c670d35cef4f4c48a164.jpg"><br>  After the plenary report, we rise to the 4th floor, where the exhibition itself and all thematic reports of the conference are held.  At the entrance, visitors are greeted by a charming girl who gives out all kinds of tickets for prize draws. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/aa4/e5f/ee6/aa4e5fee6f810466342085fd66f60e38.jpg"><br>  I want to mention several exhibition stands that I personally liked, these are: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bff/15d/8b7/bff15d8b741812c3644d90fa49148954.jpg"><br>  - Windows Azure booth where you could register your account in Azure system for free and get prizes.  There were many people who wanted to feel the cloud; <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9ec/b76/f45/9ecb76f45fcc719a0792b38522954100.jpg"><br>  - Visual Studio 2012, where you could actually install VS2012 and activate it; <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2b3/34e/145/2b334e145b69632d40bf4a8f84dfa991.jpg"><br>  - <a href="http://www.msdevcon.ru/">DevConf 2013</a> - conference booth for developers; <br>  I would like to note that I personally liked it: <br>  Labs, foreign speakers Scott Guthrie and Mark Russinovich, and also wanted to mention Dmitry Robsman‚Äôs reports on cloud technologies and reports on Java and F # development. <br>  <b>First day:</b> <br>  <u>INF 306</u> Virtual Machines and Networks in Windows Azure - <a href="http://www.msteched.ru/speakers%3FsearchString%3D%26SpeakersList%3D12">Mark Russinovich</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/257/6fe/feb/2576fefeba3efd387e97ae8ac1606cb0.jpg"><br>  <u>AZR 302</u> Inside Windows Azure - <a href="http://www.msteched.ru/speakers%3FsearchString%3D%26SpeakersList%3D12">Mark Russinovich</a> <br>  The reports of Mark Russinovich made a special impression.  Mark in the reports quite clearly showed the internal structure of Window Azure on the example of their experimental cluster.  Demonstrated a new portal, as well as all the opportunities to create virtual machines in the cloud including.  on open source systems.  Mark has long been engaged in the development of OS Windows and in recent years has been working on the Windows Azure cloud technology, so for him the main task was to show all the insides of this cloud technology. <br>  <u>AZR 203 CT</u> Scott Guthrie - Q &amp; A - <a href="http://www.msteched.ru/speakers%3FsearchString%3D%26SpeakersList%3D1">Scott Guthrie</a> <br>  The question and answer session with Scott Guthrie also added a lot.  In particular, Scott shared his plans for creating data centers in Hong Kong, and also said that the creation of a data center in Russia is in Microsoft‚Äôs plans and this is not far off. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/377/e9d/532/377e9d5320908234e9cdb30fba41fb5b.jpg"><br>  <u>AZR 207</u> Round table with Dmitry Robsman - Windows Azure cloud platform first hand - cloud technologies, services and functionality - <a href="http://www.msteched.ru/speakers%3FsearchString%3D%26SpeakersList%3D31">Dmitry Robsman</a> , <a href="http://www.msteched.ru/speakers%3FsearchString%3D%26SpeakersList%3D215">Alexey Bokov</a> <br>  Dmitry Robsman shared information about the development of the Windows Azure cloud technology, namely about the development of AD Service, which is already available in America and Europe and that soon, in 1-1.5 years, will be available in Russia.  Responding to questions from the audience and Alexei Bokov, he spoke a little about CDN.  He cited statistics that most of the information stored in blobs is not used for reading and is stored there as a backup.  Particular emphasis was placed on the development of media services, namely video transcoding using Azure resources, which significantly reduces the time spent on this process. <br>  <b>Second day:</b> <br>  The second day was spent on visiting reports and laboratory work on software development for W8 / WP8 on C # / F # as well as some AD and CIO. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f67/1d3/58e/f671d358e48d6d080926dd94e6a07501.jpg"><br>  <u>INF 323</u> Claim-based authentication in traditional and cloud environments with AD FS <br>  <a href="http://www.msteched.ru/speakers%3FsearchString%3D%26SpeakersList%3D102">Nikolay Salnikov</a> <br>  The report on AD looked at the new AD FS 2.1, which is part of Windows 2012. We listened a little about authentication and security. <br>  <u>CIO 206</u> Personnel Management Issues in an IT Company Based on the Example of Microsoft Russia <br>  <a href="http://www.msteched.ru/speakers%3FsearchString%3D%26SpeakersList%3D86">Vladimir Himanych</a> <br>  On the CIO report, we heard how Microsoft effectively manages its employees.  I really liked the TOP-50 best people system and the TOP-50 key roles, which is aimed at ensuring that the best employee holds a key role in the company. <br>  <u>INF 331</u> Inexplicable case 2012: Mark Russinovich reveals faults in Windows <br>  <a href="http://www.msteched.ru/speakers%3FsearchString%3D%26SpeakersList%3D12">Mark Russinovich</a> <br>  Very self-critical report, I advise everyone to see <a href="http://www.msteched.ru/online">http://www.msteched.ru/online</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b62/a4c/565/b62a4c565fd89efec66da74f78803b5e.jpg"><br>  <u>DEV 307</u> Tools and approaches for creating fast and high-quality JavaScript applications in Visual Studio 2012 <br>  <a href="http://www.spugachev.com/">Sergey Pugachev</a> <br>  <u>WPH 201 ILL</u> Windows Phone 8 Development: New Features <br>  <a href="http://www.spugachev.com/">Sergey Pugachev</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/401/7d6/84f/4017d684fc17e8afda5f1108f5c8d6e8.jpg"><br>  <u>DEV 211</u> F #: Functional Programming in the Service of Corporations, Startups, Researchers <br>  <a href="http://www.msteched.ru/speakers%3FsearchString%3D%26SpeakersList%3D55">Dmitry Soshnikov</a> <br>  In the labs and reports for developers, we learned a little about the development in C # for the W8 / WP8 OS.  We tried to do it ourselves and completed 4 tasks in the laboratory work on WP8, the work was devoted to the development of an application like iCook, Hungry.  Especially in the labs, touchscreen displays appealed, which allows testing applications with touch. <br>  At the end of the conference, according to the Microsoft custom, there were raffles of valuable prizes. <br>  Findings: <br>  - We are waiting for AD Azure, MS Data Centers in Russia; <br>  - We develop high-performance software using the resources of Azure Mobile Service, we participate in the <a href="http://imaginecup.com/">ImagineCup</a> ; <br>  - We develop software using corporate services, which can also be located in the cloud; <br>  - We think about what is better to transfer to the cloud, and what to leave on-permise. </div>
