To prepare, strengthen ‚Äúprotection‚Äù and take appropriate preventive measures, it is very important not to lose sight of the most notable (at least) incidents in the field of information security. <br><br>  To do this, we decided to take the most rated materials that went on Hacker News, and everything that was published on the topic of WannaCry on Habrahabr and Geektimes.ru.  We supplemented the final selection with comments from the experts of ITMO University. <br><br> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/spbifmo/blog/329512/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/e51/3bf/2f6/e513bf2f60f5479fbf13b4984fce5e24.jpg"></a> <a name="habracut"></a>  <i>Flickr / <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/e-coli/">Michele MF</a> / <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/">CC</a></i>

Fair reward or self-promotion of "generous" companies - you decide. </blockquote><br>  <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-wannacrypt-ransomware/">All the necessary information about WannaCry, Wcry and WannaCrypt</a> <br><blockquote>  Troy Hunt, an information security expert with a direct relationship to Microsoft, began collecting data on WannaCry on May 13th.  As events unfolded, the material was supplemented with technological details and various analytics (including the financial results of the "work" of the cryptographer-extortionist).  Among other things, Troy wrote a <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/dont-tell-people-to-turn-off-windows-update-just-dont/">separate material</a> about why you should not refuse to update the OS. </blockquote><br>  <a href="https://blog.comae.io/wannacry-the-largest-ransom-ware-infection-in-history-f37da8e30a58">WannaCry: the most popular extortion virus in history</a> <br><blockquote>  One of Microsoft's MVPs gathered his wiki page on everything that the cryptographer-extortionist had managed to do.  Here you can find information on how the infection occurs and get recommendations on preventive measures.  The material is filled with a huge number of useful links (including the three subsequent parts of the expert's story). </blockquote><br>  <a href="https://blog.comae.io/wannacry-new-variants-detected-b8908fefea7e">New variations of WannaCry found</a> <br><blockquote>  A brief note on what the new WannaCry species is.

In addition to the story of a random discovery that ‚Äúsaved the Internet‚Äù, you can read about how <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/289169/">Microsoft accused the NSA</a> of accumulating exploits and <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/289153/">new variations of WannaCry</a> , including without a stop crane. </blockquote><br>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/kaspersky/blog/329098/">Fake WannaCry, HP has a keylogger on firewood, Chrome downloads extra</a> <br><blockquote>  "Kaspersky Lab" examines the effects of the hype about malware.  As an example, a couple of recent news is presented, which once again reminds us that the most basic and innocuous software functionality is the first thing that attackers are adopting. </blockquote><br>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/pt/blog/328804/">Parse vulnerability CVE-2017-0263 for privilege escalation in Windows</a> <br><blockquote>  The company Positive Technologies decided to follow in the footsteps of news about WannaCry and tell about the context menu vulnerability and exploitation options. </blockquote><br><hr><br>  Kuzmich Pavel Alekseevich, Director of the Laboratory of Computer Forensic Science at the ITMO University: <br><br><blockquote>  Most likely, the employees of those organizations where they recorded the infection, used computers to receive mail and ‚Äúsurfing‚Äù on the Internet and, without being convinced of the security of the letters received and the websites being opened, downloaded malicious software onto them. <br><br>  It is quite possible that in this way confidential information of their clients could be compromised - in the case of commercial organizations, as well as large amounts of personal data - in the case of government departments.  It is hoped that such information was not processed on these computers. <br><br>  Ransomware is a well-known method of fraud and there are some specific approaches to protect.  First of all, you need to be attentive to referring to certain links on the web.  Similarly, with e-mail - very often viruses spread in files attached to letters allegedly from your Internet provider or bank.  Thirdly, it is important at least sometimes to make backup copies of important documents on separate removable media. <br><br>  The most common infection and active phase of the virus - data encryption - manifests itself in the form of a significant reduction in computer performance.  This is a consequence of the fact that encryption is an extremely resource-intensive process.  This can also be noticed when files with an incomprehensible extension appear, but usually at this stage it is too late to take any action. </blockquote><br><hr><br>  Grigory Sablin, virus analyst, expert in the field of information security of ITMO University, winner of international competition for the protection of computer information: <br><br><blockquote>  Attackers exploit a vulnerability in the SMB protocol MS17_010 - the patch is already on Microsoft servers.  Those who are not updated, can fall under the distribution.  But one can say these users are to blame themselves - they used pirated software or did not update Windows.  I myself am wondering how the situation will develop: a similar story was with MS08_67, it was then used by the Kido worm, and then too many people became infected. <br><br>  Not the fact that it will be possible to recover all locked files.  This virus can penetrate anywhere due to the fact that many computers have not yet been updated.  By the way, this exploit was taken from the archive, which was ‚Äúleaked‚Äù from the US National Security Agency (NSA), that is, this is an example of how special services can act in any emergency situation. </blockquote><br>  <i>PS We will appreciate the discussion in the comments of additional materials and opinions that you found interesting.</i>  <i>Let's put this collection together :)</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/329512/">https://habr.com/ru/post/329512/</a></p>
