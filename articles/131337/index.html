  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Home Digital Television</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  If you want to learn more about IPTV, the principles of operation of services, subscriber devices and in general, to understand how the TV has changed in recent years, welcome to Cat. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/139da68e/617bb241/d11dfa1c/ea8dcf62.jpg"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  The Home Digital TV service and all services are based on the Microsoft Media Room platform: today, in my experience, it is the most stable and universal platform that enables the deployment of IPTV services.  Most people still perceive television as something of the past, where apart from six channels and ballet, especially there is nothing to see.  However, over the years, the TV has evolved: I learned to record programs, put a ‚Äúlive‚Äù broadcast on pause, rewind, order various films from the extensive online film library (without having to register somewhere or download something for a long time), give access to various social networks , right from the TV screen and more.

    <h4>  Let us consider in more detail the features of IPTV functions. </h4><br>  In order for the Beeline home digital television to appear in the apartment, you need to stretch the cable to the apartment through which the signal will be transmitted.  This is not a traditional antenna cable, but a twisted pair (Ethernet).  One cable can transmit both TV and Internet signals simultaneously.  Then a TV set-top box is connected to the TV: this is the device that will output the signal to the TV, decode it, record the air and perform many more functions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/71dd4733/008126a9/9bb594a2/29eb3455.png"><br>  <sup>Network layout</sup> <br><br>  We are developing alternative connection methods.  For example, very soon, the client will be able to use the software client built into the TV or computer itself, without the need to buy or rent a set-top box.  It will be enough just to download the IPTV client to a computer, unpack and install.  After that, on the computer it will be possible to use all the functionality that a regular TV set-top box carries and even more.  Almost the same situation with the TV: if it supports the currently popular function of SMART-TV, all that needs to be done is to transfer the client on the flash drive from the computer to the TV.  After that, it will be possible to use almost all the functionality of IPTV. <br><br><h4>  What is IPTV cooler than regular broadcast? </h4><br>  First of all, these are well-known and favorite subscriber control functions of the air: recording, pause and rewind.  All TV set-top boxes that are used in our network are equipped with a hard disk with a capacity of 320 or 500 GB: thanks to this, the set-top box can work with a ‚Äúlive‚Äù broadcast and record it. <br>  The subscriber is in no way limited in the number of channels or broadcasts that can be recorded, or in the ability to record several channels simultaneously. <br><br>  The recording works in real time and can be activated by pressing a single button on the remote.  You can assign a record of a future program, having previously performed its search in an electronic TV program, or by searching for it by the first letters of the name.  The prefix itself will turn on at the right time, record and turn off.  There is a mode in which the console can record a series or series of programs.  The prefix itself takes control of the TV program and begins to track all the issues of a given program, methodically recording them.  Recorded issues can be viewed at any time.  The number of views is also unlimited. <br><br>  The pause function works quite simply.  At any time you press a button on the remote and the image freezes.  If you need to urgently answer the phone, or just take a break for a few minutes, then the pause function is very useful for you.  The prefix does not just stop the image, it turns on the background recording and as long as the image remains static, the recording of the broadcast will be saved to disk.  Accordingly, when viewing is resumed, everything that happens on the screen will be shown to you as if you are watching the broadcast. <br><br>  The rewind function also works simply, and its functionality also depends on the presence of a hard disk.  At the moment when you switch to the channel and start its continuous viewing, the console records everything that happens on the screen in the background.  This does not interfere with the transmission viewing, since the recording does not produce itself.  At any time while watching the program, you have the opportunity to click on the rewind button and return to the ‚Äúpast‚Äù.  If desired, even a few hours ago.  This is very useful when watching sports or feature films. <br><br><h4>  More about buns </h4><br>  Now our subscribers have access to various content.  Subscriptions for TV shows or video rental.  Plus, the capabilities of the platform are not limited to air control functions.  For example, already now users of Beeline-TV can use access to social networks directly from the TV screen.  Due to the fact that all data is transmitted in XML format, the capabilities of the platform are limited only by copyright and the imagination of developers.  In fact, you can create any application that will have any functionality, for example, a pager based on the ICQ-protocol. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/059d54a0/53f300fc/b3b2e6e1/8dcedc81.jpg"><br>  <sup>Popular TV services</sup> <br><br>  Some also need a device that allows you to enter large amounts of text and quickly edit it.  Such devices are already there, but their percentage is still very small, due to the low demand from users.  Of course, as soon as we realize that interest in such services is growing, they will also appear in our clients.  Agree, it is tempting, sitting at home and watching the next Eurovision Song Contest, discuss it right there in the running line, along with several thousand more spectators.  Or, having come home and turned on the TV, write to your friends ‚ÄúHello everyone!  And who is watching now? ‚Äù- and immediately see on the screen the ratings of programs and the number of viewers. <br><br>  Yes, even with a negative balance <b>,</b> broadcasting of the main domestic channels is <b>maintained</b> .  In particular, among them are Channel One, Russian Television, Russian Information Channel (RIC), Culture, Sport, Children‚Äôs Youth Channel, NTV, Petersburg - Channel 5. <br><br>  What do you think will happen to television in the future?  What services would you like to see? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/131337/">https://habr.com/ru/post/131337/</a></p>
