  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The United States is ready to respond to hacker attacks with a military strike, or how the virtual becomes real</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  At <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/books/92592/">the suggestion of Habr</a> , I reread the book ‚ÄúFull Root‚Äù by Alexander Chubaryan, which I liked a few years ago.  This time, the book seemed a bit more innocent and more amusing, and not least because of the strong dissonance between the reality we are used to and the one described in the book. <a name="habracut"></a>  Namely - the book tells about the future, in which network crimes are considered the heaviest and they are either given terms as in Soviet times under political articles, or a nude man is destroyed during detention.  There is also a brief historical background - it all started after the hackers landed six airplanes past the runway, fulfilling contracts with al-Qaeda. <br><br>  Strange.  They sit down not just the runway, but we‚Äôve already seen the planes right on the houses with people, and it was almost nine years ago, and there were not six planes, as many as 11 (if memory serves), one of them even The Pentagon turned into Kvadrogron.  And, it seems, we have the network police - if I do not confuse the United States with these issues for a long time, the National Security Agency (NSA) has been dealing with, we have the department K (?).  But something is not heard about the carte blanche and the murder license for these structures, the cases of hackers being caught are infrequent, the word ‚Äúhacker‚Äù does not inspire anyone in horror ... That is why the situation described in the book seems like some sort of absurd theater.  Well, I can not believe that for sending two bytes can quite a pain in the head or give life. <br><br>  But everything changes subtly - Deputy Minister of Defense for Political Affairs James Miller <a href="http://newsru.com/world/13may2010/cybercommand.html">declares</a> that the United States can and is ready to respond to attacks by hackers.

      Yes, while it is not clear to whom.  It is not clear where.  It is not clear what exactly.  But already ready.  I launched a port scanner (sorry - this is the wisest phrase I read 10 years ago in Hacker magazine and which is still remembered) - get a carpet bombing.  The absurdity is not so absurd. <br><br>  Not surprising.  We have cyber army.  Cyber ‚Äã‚Äãattacks can cause serious damage.  But cyber warfare is transient.  The recovery period after any cyberdiversion is a <a href="http://infowatch.livejournal.com/95355.html">matter of hours</a> .  In English, this is called hit-and-run.  And it seems to be all.  Damage done.  War is over.  The cyber opponent is ready and awaits a response in cyberspace ‚Äî that‚Äôs why these actions are likely to be without or little effect.  The fight is over.  And after a fight they do not wave their fists. <br><br>  But soon they will wave, but not with virtual fists.  Give only time.  Guys, the world is changing before our eyes.  We‚Äôve got used to the fact that they are really imprisoned for LJ, and for Twitter they are just, but also really, fined (this is MICRO-blog, figl).  Now let's get used to the fact that the virtual aggressors will in real life be forced to peace. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/93450/">https://habr.com/ru/post/93450/</a></p>
