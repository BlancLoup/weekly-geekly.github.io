      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

      <br>
      <b>How to participate?</b> <br>  1. Your project should use open data, create data from unstructured sources of information, or should collect information from citizens to solve social problems. <br><br>  2. Projects can be in the form of desktop applications, web applications, applications using the Abobe AIR platform, Java applications, mobile applications and, in general, any platform that you like.  For nomination for designers - this can be infographics on Flash, HTML5 or other visualization products. <br><br>  3. Available source code under MIT, New BSD, GPL or similar licenses is strongly encouraged and will be a significant plus when evaluating your project. <br><br>  4. Your project should not be associated with any political party or movement or be against any party or movement.  We are ready to accept projects dedicated to controlling the decisions of politicians, but not political projects. <br><br>  5. You must complete the application form at <a href="http://www.apps4russia.ru/submit/">http://www.apps4russia.ru/submit/</a> .  Soon after the announcement of the competition, we will begin to publish applications on the site. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  However, in order to once again invite you all to participate in our wonderful contest <a href="http://apps4russia.ru/">Apps4Russia,</a> I want to ask all of you a few questions, as well as listen to your suggestions. <br><br>  Questions such: <br>  1. Do I need a separate nomination or prize for projects in the field of Linked Data and the Semantic Web?  If yes, we will establish and add them, but I would like to see at least 5 participants on this topic.  Is there a chance to see them?  Are there any good ideas you can do in the field of Linked Data? <br><br>  2. What open data is needed most of all that I want to create in the near future, but why is there no prepared data?  There is a lot of data and you can cook even more - the question is what is needed first. <br><br>  3. We are looking for partners in order to convey information about the competition to the widest possible audience.  If you are ready to help us with this - we will be happy to add you to the list and we will be grateful for the publication of the contest and the banner of the contest.  Write me on ibegtin (dog) infoculture.ru or comment here. <br><br>  4. To support the competition, we created a special public organization " <a href="http://infoculture.ru/">Information Culture</a> " for which the competition is now the main activity, but not the only one.  The idea is to become the same as the <a href="http://okfn.org/">Open Knowledge Foundation</a> and <a href="http://sunlightlabs.org/">Sunlight Labs</a> .  Cool and tech.  But we are only at the very start, and the main thing that is lacking so far is the people and the means to launch everything that we want to do.  We are now actively looking for funds for this and I hope that we will find people to whom it is not indifferent.  I invite everyone who is ready to help us to participate and listen to all the proposals for projects that can and should be supported, funding that can be attracted and so on. <br><br>  5. Now there are many competitions around civil projects, but our difference is that we are clear about open data.  I will not praise or criticize those who make parallel initiatives - I believe that the main thing is to create an environment in which public projects would appear.  I just want to make two important accents.  Openness is openness.  Purity of principles matters here.  The source code must be open, the data must be open and everything else too.  Open Licenses, Open Data, Open Content, Open Knowledge, Open Government and many others. <br><br>  I will be especially grateful to the answers to the questions above. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/143561/">https://habr.com/ru/post/143561/</a></p>
