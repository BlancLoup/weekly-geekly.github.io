  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The Start-Up Visa Program is a new emigration program to Canada for startups and research participants.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8a3/6eb/1b3/8a36eb1b38b4a5c2e786275b25b0523f.png"><br>  When at the end of the 80's and the beginning of the 90, my friends and I were finishing the institute, many people dreamed of immigration.  The West then attracted its mystery and new opportunities ... Among all countries, perhaps the most popular was Canada.  As a country with a high degree of tolerance of the population, a fairly high standard of living, a large territory, rich in natural resources, good development of high technologies and a large Russian-speaking diaspora.  And of course close to our climate!  Many classmates have since gone to both Canada and the USA and Australia.  Only one returned.  From Australia, with no daughter and wife. <br>  Now the spiral of history has made another round and again I began to seriously think about immigration.  Similar thoughts settled in the minds of a large number of talented young people who do not want to make a career in law enforcement agencies or go to the officials hoping for a good salary increase in the form of kickbacks ... The risks of starting and running your own business become higher every day, and the prospects of losing your own business and perhaps freedom overnight is more real. <br><a name="habracut"></a>  For such people I want to talk a little bit about the immigration program for talented start-up entrepreneurs. <br><br>  The federal program to support entrepreneurs in Canada started in the distant 1970s, and according to the Canadian government is not so effective.  Its main criteria were minimum equity capital, business experience, and guaranteed status of a permanent resident, provided that at least one workplace was created over 3 years ‚Äî hardly high criteria.  Thus, the program did not encourage investors to invest in innovative enterprises, but rather promoted the reduction of investments - paradoxically, isn‚Äôt it?  On July 1, 2011, the Ministry of Citizenship and Immigration Canada imposed a temporary moratorium on new amendments to the program supporting entrepreneurs, while the program is being revised.  No one is going to cancel the moratorium. <br>  Instead, Canada began in 2012 to develop another concept, which is primarily aimed at supporting entrepreneurs who are introducing innovative ideas and world-class research programs.  Under this plan, the government intends to create a fast and flexible immigration system that would satisfy the new growing needs of the Canadian economy.  The Start-Up Visa Program is an important part of this plan. <br>  Introduction of a new visa program - an innovative approach to economic immigration <br>  Canada is looking for talented entrepreneurs who could create dynamic companies that can compete globally.  The Start-Up Visa Program will help immigrant entrepreneurs to establish contact with private organizations that have already earned a reputation, and have dealt with start-ups more than once. <br>  Over the next five years, this program will be experimental.  The Ministry of Citizenship and Immigration Canada assumes that initially, due to the narrow focus of the program, the number of applications will be small.  However, the main goal of the program is the ‚Äúquality‚Äù of applications, not their quantity.  At the initial stage, it is necessary to create a solid platform for the further development of the program and an increase in the number of applications.  If during these five years the program will pay off, the Citizenship and Immigration Canada will make it part of the Immigration and Refugee Rights Act. <br><br><h5>  Benefits of the program </h5>

      The Start-up Visa Program will allow immigrant entrepreneurs to create cutting-edge companies that will offer projects that can compete globally. <br><br>  helps you understand the organization of the business sector in Canada, which is very important for start-ups. <br><br>  open to private firms access to a huge base of entrepreneurs and allow them to hire the most talented personnel from around the world. <br><br><h5>  Program partners </h5><br><br>  Initially, partners will be: Canadian Venture and Direct Investment Association and the National Organization of ‚Äúbusiness angels‚Äú <br><br><br>  Canadian Department of Citizenship and Immigration continues negotiations with the National Organization of Business Incubators of Canada to include it in the program <br><br>  These parent organizations, based on agreements with the Ministry of Citizenship and Immigration of Canada, will nominate the most worthy candidates for participation in the Start-Up Visa Program, will form expert groups that will assist the Ministry in the event of difficulties, and will also monitor compliance with industrial standards. <br><br>  What ‚Äúbusiness angel‚Äù organizations and venture funds will participate in the project will be decided early this year.  A similar question regarding business incubator organizations will be discussed a little later. <br><br>  Foreign entrepreneurs will have to enlist the support of ‚Äúbusiness angel‚Äù organizations, venture funds or incubator organizations before they become members of the Start-Up Visa Program.  Foreign entrepreneurs should also meet certain criteria, namely, have a good command of the language, have high professional skills.  The full list of criteria will be published in spring 2013.  Applications for participation in the program will be open on April 1st, 2013. <br>  Look for details and news on the official website: <a href="http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/hire/index.asp">www.cic.gc.ca/english/hire/index.asp</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/169489/">https://habr.com/ru/post/169489/</a></p>
