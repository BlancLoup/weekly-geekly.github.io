In this small article, I want to share some of the problems in the promotion, promotion and relevance of ‚Äúlocal‚Äù news resources. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  I myself am a system administrator, editor, designer, programmer, telephone operator, and the ‚Äúeditor‚Äù proudly flaunts the workbook, which actually brings us to the first problem. <br><br><h5>  Misunderstanding </h5><br>  The problem is extremely common and not new, because I will run over it only in passing.  ‚ÄúTyzhprogrammist‚Äù and, in fact, nothing more to say.  In my opinion, the problem lies in the lack of funding, or fear of funding.

      Poorly versed leadership in the essence of the publication of the publication in the network is not eager to invest in human resources whose task they are not particularly clear. <br><br>  Oh, just a minute.  Of course, it‚Äôs not difficult for management to explain who a web designer is and why he is needed, just like a SEO promoter.  But you try to explain why it is in a good way to be different people and why you cannot do all this.  ‚ÄúTyzhprogrammist‚Äù. <br><br>  If you start to paint, to prove, and even worse, to give up the work that was not laid out to you, then you will most likely be fired and hired by a longhand who will become both the administrator and the designer and everyone, for 15 thousand a month. <br><br>  As a result, we have simply terrifying design of the vast majority of provincial Internet resources.  I'm not just talking about the media, go to any website of the administration of any city. <br><br>  The solution here can be only one thing - to occupy a management position as an understanding person, aimed at work.  And what is important is the organization‚Äôs awareness that a modern web resource is a whole range of activities, costs, and time.  A lot of time. <br><br><h5>  Frames </h5><br>  As I said, my organization has been engaged in publishing a newspaper all my life.  This is today its main goal and objective.  But at the same time, ‚Äúfrom above‚Äù want to see more and more integration of regions in the global information network. <br>  It would seem, what problems may arise with the staffing and filling the site with content?  But it's not like that <br>  simply. <br><br>  The experienced journalists, who have been working for 10-15 years in a newspaper, point blank do not understand why the sites do not care how many lines will be written to them.  Do not understand the style and presentation of notes.  They are used to paint everything in detail, beautifully with notable journalistic stylistic turns of speech.  Believe me, it is very and very difficult to ask such journalists to write briefly and succinctly and not to stretch the story about the geographic planting of a lawn in the park by such and such a party for 8 paragraphs. <br><br>  But the worst is time.  You see, the journalist in the newspaper (even if the newspaper is like our daily) leaves on the assignment in the morning, arrives in the evening, unsubscribes, the proofreader checks it, the text is transferred to the layout and only in the morning the article is published.  They are not in a hurry.  To pour a person into a rhythm is very difficult.  To explain that the Internet bill on news sites is not even for hours - for minutes it is extremely difficult.  It requires a complete restructuring of the brain and a different perception of the information flow. <br><br>  Of course, it is much easier to dismiss the old squad and recruit a new one, designed for specified goals, but this is too radical.  In addition, many provincial leaders simply can not believe in the death of print publications. <br><br>  The question of the death of publications is certainly controversial, and I want to say that the circulation of absolutely all newspapers is falling.  And fall rapidly, every day.  If it is really fair - today publications only keep on the voluntary-compulsory subscriptions of schools, hospitals and other social services.  institutions.  It all depends on the influence of the leadership.  Do not believe the statisticians.  A live subscriber today is a grandmother from a deaf village. <br><br>  Sooner or later, one way or another, management will have to make a choice - a newspaper or website. <br><br><h5>  Relevance </h5><br>  Those.  what I want to say.  And you need it?  If something very global happens in your region, you will definitely read it on lenta.ru, and the articles with the headlines ‚ÄúThe best librarian works in Storozhivka‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe Ministry of Agriculture of the region predicts to collect 3.7 million tons of grain this year‚Äù.  Seriously.  Do you need it? <br><br>  Want to tell you what sites in my region make traffic to?  By the way, moving away from the topic of the average attendance of sites in my region from 2,000 to 10,000 per day.  And they come mainly to read the news about the plans of events for the City Day, about turning off the water in such and such areas, and of course on headlines like ‚ÄúKicking a policeman while playing Saratovtsu‚Äú shines ‚Äùup to 5 years in prison.‚Äù <br><br>  Crime is a separate topic.  No one is stingy with it.  People this hawala.  Hawala, hawala and will hawala.  Crime on such resources as pornography on young trackers - to attract users.  There is little left of the media here, and the public agenda of the city is able to cope with the plan of the event for the day of the city. <br><br>  I do not want to say that local news resources are not needed.  I want to say that what they write is rubbish. <br>  Urban portals, including a news feed as one of the many useful services for citizens, will have relevance and usefulness. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/288294/">https://habr.com/ru/post/288294/</a></p>
