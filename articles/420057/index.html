At the end of it, I promised to write a new post on the topic "How to become a successful freelancer," <sub>to maintain balance in the universe</sub> .  In addition, in the private messages flew a few wishes about the new post, on the contrary.  I mean the good sides of freelancing. <br><br>  Well, it is said - done.  And I began to write.  First, I wrote out all the topics that relate to the work and life of a freelancer.  Then he broke them into subtopics, each of which can be disclosed in a separate post.  As a result, only the main topics turned out to be 20, in each of which there are 3-4 sub-topics.  That is about 60-80 posts, if you disclose each nuance separately.  This is either a whole book, or your blog, or youtube channel. <br><br>  I already had my blog, but video content is a completely new phenomenon for me.  Therefore, it was decided to take up the experiment with youtube, and kill two birds with one stone - make a post about successful freelancing and learn how to create a video.

By the way, how this video was created, in itself, is a separate fable.  About this backstage, I probably will tell in a separate post, because I did not think that it takes so much time and effort. <br><br>  Actually, under the cut edited video transcription. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, <i>8 rules of a successful freelancer</i> , which I follow and my friends.  Each of us has 10+ years of freelancing behind our backs.  During this time, we have developed our own rules and principles, to which each reached their own.  As usual, through stuffing cones and the attack on the rake.  In freelancing you get everything yourself, because you work for yourself.  Push or customize no one. <br><br>  These are the rules of a successful freelancer: <br><br><h3>  Rule number 1.  Self discipline </h3><br>  Self-discipline includes: <br><br><ul><li>  Schedule for yourself </li><li>  Schedule </li><li>  Stay in touch with the client when not working (always online) </li><li>  Stick to the terms </li><li>  Always respond to customer messages and calls </li><li>  Warn in case of delays or force majeure when you can not work </li></ul><br>  Self-discipline is the basis of your freelancing career success.  You will not have an uncle-manager who will stand over the soul.  In freelance there is no drover.  All your freelancing activities should be built on responsibility and self-discipline. <br><br><h3>  Rule number 2.  Monitor the health </h3><br>  Successful freelancer monitors their health.  On their own.  First of all, this means that it is not processed, it monitors the load on current projects and does not forget to rest. <br><br>  <a href="https://habr.com/post/318340/">In no case does not fade.</a>  When he feels very tired - the freelancer is resting. <br><br>  Also, monitoring health means: eating well, getting enough sleep and doing physical exertion.  You can start with a walk, then gradually move to jogging. <br><br>  If there is no desire to go to the gym - let the gym come to you (can be arranged at home). <br>  For example for myself, I bought a barbell and a dumbbell.  The best way to distract the brain from mental exertion is physical activity. <br><br>  I rocked - and you can continue to work. <br><br><h3>  Rule number 3.  This is a convenient workplace and fast "iron" </h3><br>  You should not have discomfort and stress during work.  Personally, I need a large table where you can place two monitors, a laptop.  Comfortable chair, comfortable "clave".  And of course fast iron, on which the Wind or Mac flies. <br>  Rule number 3 is a personal convenience that you organize for yourself. <br><br><h3>  Rule number 4.  Excellent communication </h3><br>  Not everyone can be a god of negotiations or a super salesman, but you need to be able to talk with a client. <br><br>  Even if you are a nerd or a programmer with a beard in the final stage.  Anyway, the ability to communicate well is a skill that customers love and which will allow you to take large orders with high rates.  And also build trust.  Trusting relationships are also the basis for long-term and stable work with the customer. <br><br><h3>  Rule number 5.  Only quality! </h3><br>  The fifth rule of a successful freelancer is a quality job.  Is always.  More often, customers receive an uncovered hack that does not meet the requirements and expectations.  A qualified freelancer is now a rarity, for which good money is paid. <br><br>  (The statement was taken from the experience of the customer on the freelance exchange. Among the hundreds of applications worthy - 2-3, and those - the cat in the bag. I heard the same thing from my clients.) <br><br><h3>  Rule number 6.  Safety bag </h3><br>  Every freelancer, sooner or later forced to look for a new order.  Or take a timeout. <br>  In this case, we need time and money to somehow stretch, before we find a new stable client. <br><br>  Therefore, the rule number 6 successful freelancer - it is always to have a safety cushion. <br><br>  Postponing the stash can be starting with the first project.  For a little bit, for a bit, and when over time the amount of your savings will be substantial, you can invest it and live on passive income from the percentage of investments. <br><br>  (By the way, one of my freelance acquaintances gets 50% + of monthly income from investing in a trader. His plans for the next 2 years are to live on passive income completely. <a href="https://habr.com/post/152995/">Accumulate assets and avoid liabilities</a> - remember, yes?) <br><br>  <i>What else is needed for the airbag?</i> <br><br>  In addition to waiting out the time needed to find a new order, the ‚Äúpillow‚Äù will be needed when we want to pause our freelancing activity.  To go about your business, or go on vacation, or start your project.  It could be a month, two, three.  As far as finances and size of pillows allow. <br><br>  Second moment.  When we have money, we work with clients more confidently.  When we don‚Äôt have the money, we take on any job, lower the rate, do any <i>additions</i> , and generally work on <i>it</i> , because we depend on this money.  Because we really need them now and we have no stock.  Therefore, rule number 6 is to have and grow an airbag. <br><br><h3>  Rule number 7.  Delegation </h3><br>  The next rule of a successful freelancer is delegation.  That is, to give other performers part of their work. <br><br>  This is especially true for routine tasks (such as data entry), tasks in which you do not have enough qualifications or they are beyond your specialization.  There are cases when it is simply impossible to do (for inexperienced). <br><br>  Many freelancers are afraid to get a bullshit as a result, or they do everything in principle, or simply the toad presses to pay for part of their work. <br><br>  There is some truth in this approach, but if you are afraid of everything, your income will not grow. <br><br>  In any case, if you want to scale, take more orders and earn more - learn to delegate.  Learn to find performers and give them part or all of your work.  At the same time carefully controlling the result and willingness to finish the masterpiece. <br><br><h3>  Rule number 8.  Permanent training </h3><br>  And last but not least.  Rule number 8 - Permanent training. <br>  In freelancing, as nowhere else, you need to be able to learn quickly.  Each new order is a new subject area, new tools and technologies, a new team (even if it is one customer). <br><br>  If you are young - the brain absorbs new information faster.  If experienced, then most likely you are moving within your technology stack and skills.  But learning is still necessary.  Constantly.  Himself. <br><br>  Summary.  Do not stand still, constantly improve your skills.  Learn new things.  And ultimately you will become a universal soldier who knows everything, and replaces the whole department. <br><br><hr><br><h3>  In custody </h3><br>  Perhaps someone rules seem obvious and captain.  But when I started, I did not have any schedule, I worked haphazardly, in three nights and at dawn.  Winda terribly braked on the Duron 800mhz 64mb ram.  Although there was money to deliver the brain or take a computer more powerful. <br><br>  Then I sat on a wooden chair, earning a slouch.  About communication and responsibility - it is better to remain silent.  She almost was not.  The only thing that happened was the desire to learn.  Constantly improve. <br><br>  Therefore, I hope that beginners and those who are going to freelance post will be useful. <br>  And an experienced freelancer will analyze whether everything is in his place and note something. <br><br>  Thanks for attention. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/420057/">https://habr.com/ru/post/420057/</a></p>
