    <h2>  The problem is the lack of sales growth in the expansion of production. </h2><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúWe started a business in Moscow, then went to the regions.  By 2014, more than 40 sites were built, 90% of them in the capital and the region.  Customers were attracted by advertising products with the help of catalogs, booklets and presentations.  40% of sales brought us a website and promotion on the Internet.  Given the expansion of production, there was an acute problem of lack of new customers, there was no growth in sales.  We understood that our site and its promotion need to be improved. ‚Äù </blockquote>  Alexey Krasnikov, General Director, Zabava Group <br><br>  In 2014, the Group of Companies needed to organize high-quality and effective customer acquisition from the Internet, since it was not possible to scale offline channels in the face of fierce competition in Moscow.  To solve its problems, Zabava Group of Companies turned to the <a href="https://www.obrazstroy.ru/">Web-Center Internet agency</a> , in which I manage the marketing department.  The strategy of the online agency to increase customer sales were 3 main areas.  <b>A bunch of these three areas was to ensure a steady growth in turnover and profits for the Group of Companies:</b> <br><br>  1. Complete rework of an outdated site. <br>  2. High-quality SEO promotion. <br>  3. Implementing a conversion improvement process. <br><br>  I will tell you more about each stage, I think this practical knowledge will be useful to many readers. <br><br>  <b>Stage 1. We remake the site</b> <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúToday, companies make a complete redesign of the site on average once every 4-5 years, and this period is shortened every year.  This is due to the development of new technologies and tools, CMS capabilities, changes in the behavior of web users.  By 2014, the site of the Zabava Group of Companies was very outdated in terms of technology - it was not adaptive, CMS did not allow for a major improvement in SEO promotion.  High competition in the Moscow market made it difficult for the company to maintain its position in search engines. ‚Äù </blockquote>  Roman Plotnikov, Director of the Web-Center Internet Agency <br><br>  In the new site <a href="http://www.zabava-sport.ru/">zabava-sport.ru</a> were implemented: <br><br><ul><li>  Adaptive design. </li><li>  Full catalog with the possibility of quick feedback. </li><li>  Section with ready projects of sports grounds. </li><li>  Information about completed projects with photos. </li><li>  Content sections of the site for high-quality SEO-promotion. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/1d4/cc2/5f1/1d4cc25f1fb54206a69e87f53a65f3e8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Stage 2. Doing the right SEO promotion</b> <br><br>  Data analysis and site preparation were carried out: <br><br><ul><li>  checking the age of the domain, external links, imposed sanctions, content analysis, </li><li>  competitors check, comparison of semantic kernels, </li><li>  distribution of promoted requests and determination of landing pages, </li><li>  technical check to speed up indexing, </li><li>  formation of metadata, ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù snippet, etc. </li></ul><br>  Further, on the basis of the analysis, the technical task and plan for the development of landing pages (content plan) were prepared.  Then, changes to the site in accordance with the terms of reference have already begun: <br><br><ul><li>  writing unique metadata to all pages of the site, tags Title, H1, image attributes, optimization of headings, </li><li>  setting up robots and sitemap files, </li><li>  work with Yandex.Webmaster, </li><li>  writing texts for landing pages, </li><li>  work on commercial and behavioral factors </li><li>  site navigation optimization, etc. </li></ul><br>  After the main work several times a month, the results are analyzed, problems are searched, work is under way to solve them and continuously improve the website‚Äôs position in search results. <br><br>  Friends, I understand that SEO works are described rather superficially, but in order to describe the process in detail, it would take several articles.  Therefore, <b>I can send everyone a free checklist of SEO promotion</b> , which we use in an online agency.  To do this, contact me in any convenient way, contacts are available in the <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/vasyk/">profile</a> . <br><br>  <b>Stage 3. Increase conversion</b> <br><br>  Improving the conversion and selling properties of a site is a cyclical process that consists of the following basic steps: <br><br><ol><li>  Analysis of data and key performance indicators of the site (technical analysis, heuristic analysis, usability analysis, web analytics). </li><li>  Making strong hypotheses to increase conversion and A / B testing. </li><li>  Correction of errors, improvements and experiments to increase conversion. </li></ol><br>  I described in detail the process of increasing conversion <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/295084/">in this article on Habr√©</a> , it has not lost its relevance, use it. <br><br><h2>  Where are the results? </h2><br>  <b>Steady growth in search traffic, low bounce rate</b> <br><br>  From 2014 to 2017, Yandex.Metrica shows a steady increase in traffic with seasonality: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/6bf/89e/438/6bf89e4387904052a839fadff91e59e8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Below is the growth of search traffic in May (over the past 4 years): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/09d/df8/4aa/09ddf84aa69b40e58600e960721279d8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The share of search traffic for the last year is 72.6%: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/c99/56e/9f5/c9956e9f539d429189032a4a9dfe30b9.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The bounce rate on the site decreases every year, and the depth of views increases: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/1bb/a67/841/1bba6784199d4289a33b0df0326c90d6.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Sales growth by 60%, gross profit by 30%, market share by 3.5%</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/7aa/64c/889/7aa64c8899c7429fa4ab1904c80a7945.png" alt="image"><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúSales are growing in accordance with the website analytics indicators both in Moscow and in other regions of Central Russia.  From 2014 to 2017, sales grew by 60%, gross profit by 30%, we increased our market share by 3.5%.  The increase in the volume of work was 250%.
