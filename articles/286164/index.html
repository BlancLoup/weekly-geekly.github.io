  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The most "smart" watches: crowdfunding, demand, forecasts, results</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Another reason for discussing the prospects of "smart" watches was the <a href="http://top.rbc.ru/technology_and_media/24/02/2015/54ecb1f29a79477111c29532">results of a</a> fundraising in support of the new model - <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/madrobots/blog/246338/">Pebble Time</a> : in an hour they managed to raise $ 2 million on Kickstarter.  Is this direction so promising that even a crowdfunding startup is taking off?  Or is it entirely due to Pebble? <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The first model of Pebble watches was recognized as the most successful Kickstarter startup in 2012, receiving more than $ 10 million from 69 thousand users.  ‚ÄúSmart‚Äù watches were connected to smartphones based on iOS or Android via Bluetooth and could display information about SMS, incoming calls and letters on the screen made using electronic ink technology. <br><br>  Then, in 2014, the company released a second watch model - Pebble Steel with a stainless steel case.  And so, in February, a new model came out, which collected over $ 2 million with an initial level of $ 500,000. The fundraising will last another month. <br>  Of the innovations can be noted 64-color display and microphone - with it, you can create notes and voice messages.

          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

      <br>
      In addition, on the watch of any model, you can install applications from the online store of Pebble Technology. <br><br>  The company is located in Palo Alto (California).  According to estimates from Crunchbase, about $ 27.5 million were invested in Pebble Technology from 2011 to 2013.  At the moment, the company has about 130 employees. <br><br>  For those who want to buy a Pebble Time clock faster and cheaper, a pre-order is open at Kickstarter.  They will be available in May for $ 159 or $ 179.  Retail watches will be priced at $ 199. <br><br><h4>  Competitors are not asleep </h4><br><br>  Apple plans to release its ‚Äúsmart‚Äù watch in three versions: regular, sports and premium class.  The cheapest of them will cost around $ 350.  As Apple CEO Tim Cook said, the biggest surprise for users will be how many Apple Watch tasks are performed. <br><br>  The general director of the Swiss company Swatch, Nick Hayek, in turn, said that after two or three months, the Swatch Touch watch, which does not require recharging the battery, will be released.  In addition, they implemented the function of counting steps taken and calories burned. <br><br>  Once such serious companies are involved in the struggle, it means that there really are prospects.  But are users willing to pay that kind of money for it?  What does <a href="http://androidinsider.ru/analitika/skolko-chasov-na-android-wear-prodano-za-2014-god-i-kakie-iz-nih-samyie-prodavaemyie.html">statistics</a> say about this? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/d81/16b/0f7/d8116b0f7c22bcb68ba7830dccf8a3d0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  How popular are smart watches? </h4><br><br>  In this question, the platform matters, which is supported by the clock.  The main ones are Android, Android Wear and iOS.  However, according to analysts of Canalys, Android Wear lost its position in 2014, and only 720 thousand devices were sold, which is 15% of 2013 sales.  Such manufacturers as Samsung, LG, Sony, producing a part of models based on Android Wear have already received disappointing results.  But in relation to the two other platforms, the audience is logically divided into users of Android smartphones and iOS smartphones. <br><br>  This situation largely explains the success of Pebble watches, which support two platforms at once: Android and iOS.  During 2013, over 400 thousand hours were sold.  In 2014, Pebble announced that it had sold 1 million of its watches.  If we consider that Pebble is a young startup, then this is a very serious claim to success. <br><br>  As for the Russian market, by the end of 2014, according to Svyaznoy, a little more than 220,000 ‚Äúsmart‚Äù accessories of various manufacturers were purchased. <br><br>  However, in general, the demand for smart watches is not yet high, as evidenced by GfK statistics.  But he has every chance to grow with the release of Apple Watch and the further development of Pebble Technology.  So, everything is just beginning. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/286164/">https://habr.com/ru/post/286164/</a></p>
