One semester in college in Minsk, by correspondence. <br><br>  It was then that I decided that I wanted to develop a lot of good web and only in the process of work could I learn this quickly.  About 8 years have passed and my employers are satisfied with my work.  But the thought that I did not feel the smell of the diploma did not leave me.

      So, I started searching for a university with certain conditions: <ul><li>  internet profile program </li><li>  quality and recognized education </li><li>  on-the-job distance learning </li></ul><br><br><h4>  <b>Where to search and how to check</b> </h4><br>  First, I reconciled with the fact that the next 3-4 years I will spend on getting a bachelor degree. <br>  Therefore, I received a lot of good offers for " <a href="https://www.google.com/search%3Fq%3Dbsc%2Bcomputer%2Bscience%2Bdistance%2Blearning">bsc computer science distance learning</a> ".  It is quite simple to check the quality of a university; it is worth looking for it in fresh ratings: <ul><li>  QS: <a href="http://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/2012/subject-rankings/technology/computer-science">computer science world ranking</a> </li><li>  Guardian: <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/table/2012/may/21/university-league-table-2013">top British universities</a> </li><li>  Guardian: the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/table/2012/may/22/university-guide-computer-sciences-it">best IT universities in England</a> </li></ul><br><br><h4>  <s>B</s> <b>MSc</b> </h4><br>  Along the way, looking into the master's programs, I began to notice that many universities agree to work experience instead of undergraduate.  And this is very reasonable, since undergraduate studies are practical knowledge that can be obtained through hard work.  Therefore, I decided to use the accumulated experience and get a higher degree in a couple of years. <br><br>  Change the letter <i>b</i> to <i>m</i> and on request " <a href="https://www.google.com/search%3Fq%3Dmsc%2Bcomputer%2Bscience%2Bdistance%2Blearning">msc computer science distance learning</a> " we get even more suggestions.  By the way, there are aggregators that allow you to conveniently find a university (for example, <a href="http://www.masterstudies.com/">masterstudies.com</a> ). <br><br><h4>  <b>What to do</b> </h4><br>  I liked the <a href="http://bit.ly/PCIrQC">MSc in Internet Systems</a> program <a href="http://bit.ly/PCIrQC">from the University of Liverpool</a> .  The university takes a good place in the ratings, and the program is a miracle for me.  I sent a request with a description of my situation and the consultant (Enrolment advisor) called back and told me about the university and the future plan. <br><br>  What documents were required: <ul><li>  <b>CV</b> - CV with achievements </li><li>  <b>Reference letter</b> - <b>letter of</b> recommendation from the manager </li><li>  <b>Motivation statement</b> - an explanation of why I want to do, why it is for them, why it is for this program, what this education will give me.  By the way, it is for this letter that they evaluate the level of English, no TOEFL tests (although I am going to pass this test). </li><li>  <b>Diploma &amp; certificates</b> - I do not have a diploma, so I sent a certificate and certificates to CIW.  By the way, the University of Liverpool has a staff translator from the Russian language, that is, there is no need to translate anything. </li></ul><br><br>  On all the way, the consultant helps in every way and checks the documents (by the way, without prepayment). <br>  And now, after a couple of weeks, I received a long-awaited greeting: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/506/8cd/3e1/5068cd3e187acb7fa9a97b2989163196.png"><br><br><h4>  <b>Where to pay</b> </h4><br>  Next, the consultant sends a student agreement in accordance with the selected payment mode (one-time, three approaches, by module, every month for three years or every month for four years). <br><br>  The cost of training consists of the following items: <ul><li>  170 euros - payment for the work of a consultant and admission committee, one time </li><li>  500 euro - reservation of place (prepayment of tuition), one time </li><li>  550 euros - tuition, every month, 36 times </li><li>  buying textbooks (the first two on Amazon came to me at 70 euros, but the university has its own store of new and used books) </li></ul><br><br><h4>  <b>How to study</b> </h4><br>  The University of Liverpool is building a distance system with the organization <a href="http://www.laureate.net/">Laureate</a> , which has vast experience in these systems.  On a <a href="http://success.ohecampus.com/">special site for beginners</a> there is a lot of information about what will happen next and what you should be ready for (webinars are especially pleasant). <br><br>  Training begins in October, but first you need to go through the zero module - student training.  In short, you need to write a text about yourself, place it on Turnitin (anti-cheating system) and on a common board, meet other students from around the world and go through a few more steps. <br><br>  After successfully completing this training module, students are credited to the first module. <br>  In my case, this is Computer Structures, which will begin in a couple of weeks. <br><br><h6>  I am happy to answer questions.  Thank! </h6></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/151844/">https://habr.com/ru/post/151844/</a></p>
