  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Getting amateur category</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The topic of amateur radio communication in the format ‚Äúfor beginners‚Äù <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/127862/">has</a> already been raised <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/127235/">several</a> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/127862/">times</a> on Habr√©, but the procedure itself for obtaining the amateur category and call sign has not been considered in detail.  It should be noted that this procedure is quite simple and, moreover, free of charge, but some nuances of a purely bureaucratic-procedural nature are taking place, so the instruction can save someone a little time. <br><br>  I do not pretend to be a guru in this issue, moreover, it just so happened that recently I needed to get a call sign and register a simple portable transceiver.  Whether it will ever lead me to the ranks of the athletes-radio amateurs is hard to say, for the time being I have not attributed myself to them. <br><br>  Interested please under the cat. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  To begin with, about a year ago, the procedure for checking qualifications was standardized, which somewhat simplifies preparation.

      Next, the points. <br><br>  <b>1. Required information.</b>  The first thing you need to do is, in fact, take on the <a href="http://www.srr.ru/HF/exam.php">website of the SRR</a> (Union of Radio Amateurs of Russia) <a href="">questions</a> for the exam and the <a href="">program</a> for self-testing. <br><br>  <b>2. Preparation.</b>  Prepare best for category 3.  The questions are almost the same as 4, so why not.  You can officially pass on 2 external speaker, even on 1, but in most radio clubs you will be sent very far with this idea.  For nothing.  If you strongly need - look to them again in a month. <br>  By the method of preparation - then someone likes that.  Having some initial knowledge base and a good memory, I just read the questions with the answers and was ready to give up.  Some of my acquaintances simply dug in the programs until they began to get a stable result, since at the end of the exam you are given statistics on which you can deal with your mistakes.  If in electronics and radio communications you are a complete zero, it is not superfluous to read something clever like <a href="http://www.cqham.ru/xe1.htm">this</a> .  In general, the tests are simple and pass, if desired, as the right - everything. <br><br>  <b>3. Verification.</b>  First you need to find a local radio club.  As a rule, it is located in the DOSAAF building, if there is one.  In Kazan, where I personally surrendered, they even have a <a href="http://radioklub.narod.ru/kdk/kdk.html">saytik</a> with all the necessary information.  The exam is usually held once a month.  It is better to drop in or at least call the club in advance and find out what is required to have with you, whether it is necessary to declare in advance and whether there are any special fees or rules in the local club.  Let's say that the whole procedure is free of charge for us, and with us you only need to have a completed <a href="http://radioklub.narod.ru/kdk/zayavlenie.doc">application of a</a> standard form.  I was not even asked for an identity document. <br>  And yes!  People are different everywhere, but be prepared for the flow of stupid questions of the class ‚ÄúMan, but why do you need it?‚Äù And ‚ÄúAnd the equipment, that is / what / why / where / how much / and if I find it?‚Äù.  It's all clear.  Radio amateurs today are their own rather closed and few parties, which you, like, are going to enter.  Consider such issues as a kind of adequacy test or face control.  Personally, I almost failed, with a fright and from surprise. <br><br>  <b>4. Call sign.</b>  If everything went well, then you get into your hands a document with the harsh name ‚ÄúExtract from the minutes of the meeting of the commission for checking the compliance of operational and technical readiness to the minimum requirements for radio operators in the amateur service‚Äù.  Here it is.  My looks like this <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Statement</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/094/df5/8d8/094df58d8452e157283d0efd16654eef.jpg" alt="image"></div></div>  , but in general it may slightly differ from club to club. <br>  You also need to fill out <a href="http://www.srr.ru/DOCUMENTS/docs/zayavlenie_fizlitsa.doc">a</a> standard form <a href="http://www.srr.ru/DOCUMENTS/docs/zayavlenie_fizlitsa.doc">application</a> .  Everything is simple, the main thing is not to get confused with the translation of the name and surname into the Latin alphabet and indicate the correct line in the section ‚ÄúNote‚Äù.  There are <a href="http://www.srr.ru/DOCUMENTS/docs/recommendations_of_srr_grchtc.pdf">recommendations</a> for filling. <br>  The received two documents need to be scanned and sent to the mail grfc@grfc.ru.  It is possible to send by mail in paper, but this option is strongly recommended by experienced people. <br><br>  <b>5. We are waiting.</b>  Actually at this stage while I am.  We are waiting for about two weeks for the HRCC decision on your documents and something about ‚Äúforever‚Äù until our beloved ‚ÄúRussian Post‚Äù has already delivered the HAREC certificate with your call sign and assigned category. <br><br>  <b>6. Registration of equipment.</b>  If there are any, all your radio stations, transceivers and other receivers need to be registered in the local branch of the RKN personally.  Address can be found on the <a href="http://www.rsoc.ru/">official website</a> .  For Kazan information <a href="http://16.rsoc.ru/about/contacts/">here</a> .  For some other regions, a replacement of the number at the beginning of the link to the number of your region may work. <br>  Please note that if you do not live in a private house, then you will have to discuss the installation of the HF antenna separately with local residents. <br><br>  As I make my own progress in the path of amateur radio, the post can be supplemented, or it can grow into a small series. <br>  I will be glad to see tips from more experienced people. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/178329/">https://habr.com/ru/post/178329/</a></p>
