Alas, apparently all comes to an end.  Two cases will be considered, unlawful blocking of the resource and billing contrary to the tariffs. <br>  Let's start ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Foreword </h4><br>  When Yota appeared on the market as a cellular operator, I almost immediately switched to them, since the ideology and conditions against the background of the Big Three were like a breath of fresh air: no asterisks and footnotes, lots of tariffs, options, packages and other things.  Everything is clear and understandable: I want so many minutes, here‚Äôs the slider, here‚Äôs the amount of the monthly fee.  When Yota canceled no-limit for the Internet, I was not really upset, I don‚Äôt spend a lot of traffic, with the new tariffs it became possible to pay even less.  Support has always responded quickly and promptly. <br>  But‚Ä¶

    <h4>  The essence </h4><br>  The first bell was a problem with access to the documentation on the Home-Assistant, I actively use this thing and often look at the component help.  However, in October, the site became unavailable.  Yota technical support was concise: Roskomnadzor.  But I am a meticulous person, I thought, why not ask the RKN, on what basis this resource is actually blocked.  The ILF sent (after sufficiently long buttouts in the email correspondence) the official, certified by an electronic signature, the answer, in which it was unequivocally said that the home-assistant.io resource was not listed in the block lists.  I sent this answer to Yota in joy, believing that since there is a RKN resolution, the resource is unblocked, but it was not there.  Yota rested on the fact that although the domain name was not blocked, the IP address on which the site is located is blacklisted for the company with the entire subnet.  Well, ok, maybe the guys do not know how to use nslookup, I did it for them and sent information about the alternative IP, on which the site is available and which is not blocked in the territory of the Russian Federation.  However, according to the Yota technical support response, they cannot reconfigure rezolv domains in other IPs, and all that is proposed to be done in this situation is to accept.  I sent a written claim on this question (no answer yet) and switched to the OpenNIC DNS, but this does not solve the problem on the mobile, where you can not set your own DNS server. <br><br>  The second problem, which became the last straw and prompted to make this public, is connected with tariffs.  I am a practical person and I like to optimize, so I figured that 100 minutes (minimum package of minutes per month) I do not slander, moreover, I usually do not slander 50r (the cost of this package) either.  Therefore, I took the opportunity to choose 0 minutes and pay by the minute.  And here began the oddities.  On the official website yota.ru, under the link ‚Äúmore about the tariff‚Äù all are indicated (in fact, there are no) pricing details, namely: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-v/0e/4x/-v0e4xvtibrixkpvbrsxltuxnt4.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  But then came the new settlement period, and I was surprised to find that in the official application there is another figure: ‚Äúfrom 2.9 ppm‚Äù.  My fair question about how, on the site, it is written in black and white that 2.5r / min, I had to ask four (!) Yota employees, and each time I received different answers, both in content and degree of adequacy . <br><br>  The first employee didn‚Äôt bother to get into the essence of the problem at all, dropped a link to the detailed description of the tariff (which is hidden in About Company -&gt; Documents), and told further questions about writing a paper claim.  I studied this document and found two provisions related to this issue: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/iv/9y/g0/iv9yg0_0arw_htvtgy4univ6mly.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-c/90/zx/-c90zxajcnqvlw6j3k3dmb9og60.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  Okay, as it turned out, in the absence of a package of minutes, special conditions apply (which is not a word in the description on the fare page, even with a footnote), billing follows the so-called  "Basic" tariff.  We look at its description: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/3c/wq/cs/3cwqcs_zgz1edw_xjrtnzo413wc.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  And again there is not a single mention of the number 2.9!  The second manager, having familiarized himself with the correspondence, said that the colleague was sealed, the billing of course is 2.5p, everything is fine, they say, if you do not believe, look at the details.  And the fact that the application 2.9r - fix. <br>  Since the new tariff has just entered into force, I haven‚Äôt had any calls yet and I decided to check.  I called, chatted for 2 and a half minutes (which Yota kindly rounded up to three) and, having made some simple mathematical calculations, found out that 2.9 p / min is charged.  With new knowledge, I again turned to support.  The third manager said that the first colleague was right, and the second was not, and the reason for the difference in tariff and real value was suggested by the wrong region.  I, of course, checked: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yx/it/xf/yxitxfke7dshrxg8l-qiyokdixe.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  I was again advised to write a paper claim and buy a package of minutes, it‚Äôs profitable.  As a result, the fourth manager finally admitted that the information on the site does not correspond to reality, and they will definitely correct it.  Unfortunately, the information on where exactly the site contains incorrect billing (recall, the figure 2.5 appears in at least two sections), and how long the site has been given false, in fact, they refused to give me the information.  Recalculate the write-off according to current prices on the site - too. <br><br><h4>  Finally, some lyrics </h4><br>  The point, of course, is not in the extra 40 kopecks, I still don‚Äôt call too much.  The point is with respect to customers, when it is possible to charge against the prices on the site, to spit on the failure to render services to customers, hiding behind the ILV (which contradicts their contract, which clearly states that the operator must provide communication services of good quality) own tariff line and one after another disproving the words of previous colleagues and so on.  The saddest thing is that this happens at one of the best representatives of the class of operators and there is simply no one to go to, except to refuse from mobile communication at all.  But I think that this should be made public, perhaps sooner or later, the critical mass will be gained. <br><br>  <b>UPD.</b>  The application has been reviewed, the conditions on the website have been changed, and now, if you select 0 minutes, under the General Conditions section, additional conditions appear with a tariff of 2.9 p / min. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/431482/">https://habr.com/ru/post/431482/</a></p>
