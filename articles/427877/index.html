In Russia, it occurs less frequently, but in English-speaking countries, many are already tired.  And the British .NET developer <b>Dylan Beatty is</b> particularly keen on him: he is a fan of rock music, so he sees well how far this ‚Äúrockstar‚Äù is from real rockstars. <br><br>  As a result, Dylan started the programming language Rockstar, the code on which should be similar to rock / metal texts.  Firstly, if you can make such a project noticeable, you can take away the words ‚Äúrockstar developer‚Äù from recruiters, giving them a new meaning.  And secondly, it is interesting to try to compile the lyrics of your favorite songs!  Well, doing stickers on a certified rockstar developer laptop is also fun.

      Of course, all this sounds like a joke, and initially it was, but now it is becoming more and more real.  Details - under the cut. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It all started with the fact that developers began ironically to beat the notion of "rockstar developer", recalling the real rock stars.  You may remember this picture: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/w-/t7/zs/w-t7zsq0q2sqmngztcrzixmyvvk.jpeg"><br><br>  And such jokes eventually reached such a tweet: <br><br><div class="oembed"><twitter-widget class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered" id="twitter-widget-0" style="position: static; visibility: visible; display: block; transform: rotate(0deg); max-width: 100%; width: 500px; min-width: 220px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;" data-tweet-id="1013960369465782273"></twitter-widget><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br><br>  It is unlikely that the author of this tweet suggested that anyone would ever really undertake to do this.  Here you need a person who loves programming, rock music, and humor at the same time, and is ready to do a lot of work for the sake of one successful joke. <br><br>  But Dylan Beatty is just that.  He has long been making programmer parodies of rock hits - that is, he just connects programming, rock music and humor, spending a fair amount of time on it.  You can listen, for example, to his version of Pink Floyd's Another Brick in the Wall, which comes to a bang at IT conference parties: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mq1MD5qXI08" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Dylan recalled the already existing esoteric languages, where they did not set the goal ‚Äúto become more popular than C ++‚Äù, but set the goal ‚Äúlet's implement an interesting idea, simply because we can‚Äù.  Among them are those who introduced vocabulary and stylistics from some other area into the code: for example, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakespeare_Programming_Language">Shakespeare</a> language, styling programs for Shakespeare's plays, and Lingua :: Romana :: Perligata, positioned as ‚ÄúPerl in Latin‚Äù.  Yes, nobody writes in production on them, but the very fact of their existence makes our world a little bit more colorful. <br><br>  With these thoughts, he decided to create a language where FizzBuzz might look like this: <br><br><pre><code class="hljs pgsql">Midnight takes your heart <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">and</span></span> your soul <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">While</span></span> your heart <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">is</span></span> <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">as</span></span> high <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">as</span></span> your soul Put your heart <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">without</span></span> your soul <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">into</span></span> your heart Give back your heart Desire <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">is</span></span> a lovestruck ladykiller My world <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">is</span></span> <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">nothing</span></span> Fire <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">is</span></span> ice Hate <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">is</span></span> water <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">Until</span></span> my world <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">is</span></span> Desire, Build my world up <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">If</span></span> Midnight taking my world, Fire <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">is</span></span> <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">nothing</span></span> <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">and</span></span> Midnight taking my world, Hate <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">is</span></span> <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">nothing</span></span> Shout "FizzBuzz!"

Take it <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">to</span></span> the top Whisper my world</code> </pre> <br><br>  In August, Dylan started a <a href="https://github.com/dylanbeattie/rockstar">repository</a> on GitHub and wrote about his idea <a href="https://twitter.com/dylanbeattie/status/1020769511086219264">on Twitter</a> , without expecting any particular reaction - and suddenly everything exploded with retweets and githab stars.  Circles have diverged to the point that he was <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/meet-the-boffin-behind-a-computer-programming-language-based-on-power-ballads">interviewed</a> by Classic Rock magazine. <br><br>  In this interview, Dylan remarked that starting a similar project is ‚Äúhow to try to go around Canada on a monocycle: this is not done to solve a real problem, but to see what you can achieve by driving yourself into an unusual frame.‚Äù <br><br>  I also noticed that with all the hype, the future of the project is in question: the Internet very quickly switches to new jokes, so the next day Rockstar may be forgotten, not having time to be realized. <br><br>  However, although the first wave of interest really subsided, the project does not look abandoned.  And now he looks much more elaborate than a simple joke for one day.  When you read the <a href="https://github.com/dylanbeattie/rockstar">specification</a> , it is impressive in two ways.  Firstly, it shows that they really thought ‚Äúhow such a language should look like‚Äù, and not just sketched something in five minutes and forgot.  And secondly, it is very funny in some places: <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe use of comments is not encouraged.  This is rock and roll, the audience should make sense in the text! ‚Äù <br><br>  "The type system is similar to ECMAScript, only <i>undefined</i> doesn't sound rock-n-roll enough, so we decided to use the word <i>mysterious</i> ." <br><br>  ‚ÄúSince Rockstar combines programming, English and rock and roll, everything is difficult with apostrophes.  In programming, they are used for string values ‚Äã‚Äã- 'like this'.  In English for abbreviated forms - you're, he.  And in rock and roll, it seems, they use randomly at all: sweet child o 'mine, ain't talkin' bout love, guns n 'roses'. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ow/zi/qz/owziqzkc_2ht83x4odggqraug8o.jpeg"><br><br>  We decided to clarify some details with Dylan himself: <br><br>  <b>- At first glance, this idea looks like a ‚Äújoke on one commit‚Äù, which will not be followed by a second one.</b>  <b>But now there are 132 commits in the project - do we understand correctly that he is alive?</b> <br><br>  - Yes!  It began as a joke - the first draft of the language specification I wrote, sitting in a bar at a laptop.  I posted it on GitHub, posted links on Twitter ... and got over a thousand stars on GitHub.  And then people do the implementations.  Someone created a transpaser Rockstar-JavaScript, someone else - syntax highlighting for Sublime Text and VS Code.  People created pull requests, opened an issue, did their own implementations - it was awesome. <br><br>  Now there is a whole small team engaged in the reference implementation of Rockstar;  There is a group in Discord, where we discuss language design.  It is still a comic language - but it is a comic language with a set of integration tests and a recursive descending parser, and in November we plan to release 1.0. <br><br>  <b>- Is this language strictly for rock fans?</b>  <b>Fans of hip-hop or pop music have nothing to catch here?</b> <br><br>  - I do not even know!  The original idea was that recruiters could no longer talk about ‚Äúrockstar developers‚Äù ... is there such a thing as a hip-hop developer?  But the language is designed to match the lyrics of the songs as a whole, there are no things strictly requiring the use of precisely rock vocabulary.  I am sure that you can write such a hip-hop text, which will be a valid program. <br><br>  <b>- Do you want to somehow combine Rockstar with the parodies that you are famous for?</b> <br><br>  - To write such a parody of a rock song that will also be a valid Rockstar program at the same time?  Sounds interesting ... maybe I'll try after we finalize specification 1.0 :) <br><br><blockquote>  Finally, a small announcement.  We know Dylan due to the fact that he regularly speaks at our .NET-conference DotNext: his reports each time receive excellent reviews, showing that he is good not only in parodies.  And at the nearest <b><a href="https://dotnext-moscow.ru/">DotNext 2018 Moscow</a></b> (November 22-23), he will close the conference with the ‚ÄúCtrl-Alt-Del: learning to love legacy code‚Äù report.  And he will surely, as usual, grab a guitar with him in order to perform his parodies in front of everyone at a conference party.  In general, if you want to discuss Rockstar with him, see him as a speaker or hear his work alive - you know <a href="https://dotnext-moscow.ru/">where it can be done</a> . <br></blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/427877/">https://habr.com/ru/post/427877/</a></p>
