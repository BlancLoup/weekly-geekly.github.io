It will be possible to take part in the <s>auction of unprecedented generosity</s> until 22:00 on November 29, Moscow time. <br><br>  This year, the creators of Steam together with the sale announced another event that will be held in December of this year - the game award of the <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/SteamAwardNominations/">Steam</a> Community community, where the best games in the nominations listed are determined by the players themselves. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Sale will be already quite ordinary.  Every day new games will be added to the sales window.  Steam also abandoned the practice of "floating" discounts and flash discounts.  Now the published discount on the game is final and will not be changed until the end of the event.

      The sale may already please gamers with decent discounts on GTA V (if you have not purchased it for so many years), The Witcher 3 and other interesting titles.  Unfortunately, for the latest arrivals in the form of Civilization VI, the discount is either scanty or absent altogether. <br><br>  Much more interesting organized award Steam Awards.  In the gaming industry there is no consensus as to which award is the most prestigious among gamers.  Many are equal in the Golden Joystick, but not everyone participates in its voting. <br><br>  Creating a personal premium in the framework of the most popular PC game store is a good one: the Steam audience numbers millions of gamers around the world, and some of them also take an active part in community life.  In this case, everyone can take part in the voting. <br><br>  Participation in the Steam Awards can be divided into two stages: the voting itself and the execution of tasks to raise the level of the Steam profile and get a profile. <br><br>  In total, the award creators propose to determine the best games in eight nominations approved by the organizers and one selected by the community: <br><br><ul><li>  Award "Tested by time"; </li><li>  Award "I do not cry, just something in my eye"; </li><li>  Award "Well, another five minutes"; </li><li>  Award "NIFIGASEBE!"; </li><li>  Prize "The villain who wants to hug"; </li><li>  Prize "Playing in the game"; </li><li>  Award ‚ÄúI liked this game even before it became a hit‚Äù; </li><li>  Award "The best use of rural living creatures"; </li><li>  Award "We have not thought of everything" (determined by the community). </li></ul><br>  A detailed description of the nominations can be found <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/SteamAwardNominations/">on the Steam website</a> or in the PC application. <br><br>  Perhaps the first pancake came out lumpy, but here you will not find the usual nominations "game of the year", "MOBA of the year" or "Strategy of the year."  Instead, we are offered to choose a game with the most charismatic villain, a game with the best use of livestock or the best mini-game inside. <br><br>  The Internet has begun the expected activity around the last, yet uncertain nomination.  Many offer options that come down to "a game that needs to be continued."  Yes, exactly what you thought: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/aa0/964/9ea/aa09649ea9655950b64c2ff91237f523.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In addition, they did not bypass the recent theme of the patient, namely, cheating on CS: GO servers: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3a5/b60/433/3a5b6043384f51e7d307c48c2ff1dee7.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Perhaps, the creators of the award sought to move away from the canon of the genre, but the impossibility of clearly defining the list of games or at least conducting a genre vote, choosing "Game of the Year" and "Failure of the Year" (hi NMS!) Is somewhat depressing.  Although, taking into account the army of fans of CS: GO and Dota 2 on Steam, these Valve projects would become the game of the year from time to time, which, you will agree, would look a bit strange. <br><br>  In any case, this is the first such event from the Steam and Valve team and, we hope, not the last.  In addition, voting is a kind of marketing research for a more subtle understanding of the preferences of the public, because it‚Äôs one thing to buy a game and another to play. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/399395/">https://habr.com/ru/post/399395/</a></p>
