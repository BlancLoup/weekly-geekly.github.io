At about the same time, our director came across the Habrovsky announcement of TechCrunch Moscow, and we unanimously decided: ‚ÄúOf course we will go!‚Äù, Especially since the occasion was worthy - the launch of a stable version 7.0 and the first official release of <a href="http://www.teamlab.com/ru">Teamlab Office</a> . <br>  But today is not only about us. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  <b>War and the world of technology business</b> </h4><br>  This year, the theme of the event was chosen specific - "War and Peace".  The idea is very interesting: young, daring newcomers and startups are against market leaders, established traditions and monsters of the IT industry.  We, with our ambitions, of course, were among the bold startups. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d4b/ef9/387/d4bef938793de1eb10e3355f887d6163.jpg">

      For two days in non-stop mode, you could learn all about the latest trends in cloud technologies, the best ways to attract investments, successful case studies to foreign markets and, of course, exchange contacts.  After two days of participation, we were convinced that the atmosphere at <a href="http://tc.digitaloctober.ru/">TechCrunch Moscow is</a> indeed very emotional.  In the corridors one could easily meet Anton Nosik, Petr Didenko and Mike Butcher himself, the editor-in-chief of TechCrunch Europe.  The bar managed to have a snack with the guys from Bitrix, in the meantime talk with representatives of Mail.ru Group and Ckolkovo.  Official and pathos - zero, and this, you know, is very conducive to pleasant communication.  Special thanks for this to the Digital October team and, of course, to <b>Maria Adamyan</b> , the center's curator. <br><br>  PS Turkey rolls were just a treat! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6ad/c03/410/6adc034109d4b8b8f6b663a81480eec1.jpg"><br>  <i>* Alexandra, Teamlab Marketing Manager, invites you for a lunch break.</i> <br><br><h4>  <b>There were three key events for us:</b> </h4><br>  1. <b>Demo day.</b>  44 start-ups, eager to get to the final, were thrown by 3-minute pitches from the stage of the conference hall in front of the jury and Mike Butcher. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/30f/02c/7df/30f02c7df873d0102d0c85a09ede42c3.jpg"><br>  <i>* Teamlab 3-minute pitch.</i>  <i>Demo day.</i> <br><br>  2. <b>LaunchPad.</b>  The teams that appointed the launch of their projects for December 9-10, as well as those who prepared new versions for these numbers (well, like us, for example), could publicly announce this from the stage of the pressroom before the bloggers and journalists. <br><br>  3. <b>Battle Startups.</b>  The final round for those who have passed the qualifying round.  Only 6 startups out of 44. This time, the pitch was given 6 minutes and the jury had the opportunity to ask questions. <br>  At the same time, both days there was an active work on the stands of the Startup Alley, in the conference room there were heated discussions on ‚Äúweather, fashion and cinema‚Äù, Zeptolab and Dnevnik.ru performances, venture panels and presentations. <br><br><h4>  <b>6 best startups TechCrunch Moscow 2012</b> </h4><br>  Let's look at the finalists (from left to right). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a6d/9d7/661/a6d9d7661969612811eb78c26ec50e46.jpg"><br><br>  <a href="https://ohmystats.com/">OhMyStats</a> - offering, it would seem, the dream of marketers.  Analytics for ecommerce, answering 3 main questions: the cost of attracting each user, the profit from it and the most effective channels. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.adeasy.ru/">AdEasy</a> is an advertising sales automation that works in 3 clicks: creating a banner, choosing placement days and paying. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.excursiopedia.com/">ExcursioPedia</a> is a godsend for those who love to plan their own travel.  Allows you to make an individual tour, taking into account the interests, prices and opportunities. <br><br>  <a href="http://realtimeboard.com/">RealtimeBoard</a> is a tool for collaboration on ideas and projects.  According to the authors - endless virtual boards.  We admit, we really liked both the idea and the design. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.teamlab.com/ru">Teamlab Office</a> , that is, we. <br><br>  <a href="http://endorphin.me/">Endorphin.me</a> - simplifies the search for the right contacts using your first and second level connections in social networks. <br><br>  As you can see, the finalists got really really strong, and, perhaps, you can devote a separate post to each pitch.  But we are still in the Teamlab blog, so I dare to talk about the preparation and participation in a little more detail. <br><br><h5>  <b>Section "sharing experience"</b> </h5><br>  Preparation for the pitches was about a week, and what we got is the result of active teamwork, because by TechCrunch Moscow we launched a <a href="http://www.teamlab.com/ru">new site</a> and a new version of the product. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bdb/1dd/35c/bdb1dd35c368939375674d5cf7bacd0a.png"><br><br>  All departments of the company were involved: while in the marketing department the written speech was criticized and edited, the designers worked on the presentation, the testing department unanimously caught bugs so that during the exhibition there were no misunderstandings and the programmers were actively preparing for the release of the new product.  Great work has been done. <br>  By the way, writing a speech for 3 minutes, fitting all the necessary information into it is not as easy as it may seem at the beginning.  But we managed) I hope the simultaneous interpreter is not too offended by us. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2d9/c0f/016/2d9c0f01633c25457dd51a3cbef6f9de.jpg"><br>  <i>* Teamlab opens faces.</i>  <i>Our speaker Nina and our ‚ÄúFreaky‚Äù team)</i> <br><br>  For those who plan to participate in TechCrunch 2013, of course, there are parting words. <br><br>  First, by pitches.  Do not pour water.  No water at all.  You have only 180 seconds to explain the uniqueness of your product, and the unsubstantiated ‚Äúworld's first‚Äù or ‚Äúunique technology‚Äù is not shot here.  Clearly: problem, solution, audience, market, competitors, advantages, plans for distribution.  Unfortunately, this time there were those who for 3 minutes failed to show the product once. <br><br>  Secondly, let me speak from my heart.  The official language of TechCrunch is English.  Among the guests, the press and the most influential members of the jury there are people who DO NOT UNDERSTAND in Russian.  If you realize that your English is far from intelligible, then you need to do something with it.  It will be very offensive if the uniqueness of the project can not be assessed only because of the language barrier. <br><br>  Thirdly, in addition to the speeches, you have to do a lot of work at the stand, which you should also carefully prepare for.  Make a presentation for plasma as attractive and tasty.  When a person walks along the corridor of 44 booths, the screenshots and texts will not catch him exactly.  Prepare a workplace: the lack of laptops and talkative representatives of your project is a trifle for which you may miss someone important. <br><br>  As an example, the video that we prepared for the exhibition. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/ii1u2xcVqgQ%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgF0AT33p4jMfbvsue_qNVEe9qtXQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h4>  <b>Profit</b> </h4><br>  If someone else is not sure about the expediency of participation - doubt away!  In addition to the opportunity to meet, socialize, shine and share, you will find a lot of positive emotions and invaluable experience that you want to share and share.  You can endlessly talk about why TechCrunch Moscow is a <b>must go</b> , but you are probably already tired of reading, so for entertainment and educational purposes, we offer you a recording of our three-minute pitch in the translation of Goblin. <br>  Yes, yes, you heard right.  <b>You can laugh!</b> <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/wb_aoQfl1dM%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhVMYyebE6A0aMQ82q71a3G70utVg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/162981/">https://habr.com/ru/post/162981/</a></p>
