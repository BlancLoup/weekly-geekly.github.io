I am the director of WebCanape.  For the next few months, I want to spend on systematizing the knowledge and experience that helped WebCanape enter the top 100 web studios and start earning in the most competitive market ‚Äî website development.  I plan to reduce this experience into 15 materials that, perhaps (very much I hope), will be for web studios with a small staff and big ambitions - useful practical instructions in this difficult path. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  I will not write about how to look for customers and build sales.  I will not write about what should be the design, about the quality of the code, etc. I will describe in stages the creation of a working business - a sequence of steps, including business planning, technology, motivation system, KPI system, search and organization of work with employees, accounting , work with leads, organization of work of departments, accounting of subscriber services, etc. Exactly as if I now opened a web studio from the very beginning.  My task is to tell how to make the studio work more efficiently, more profitably and quickly.  For the studio's profit lies in the time it loses in vain for routine operations.

    <h3>  Why am I doing this? </h3><br>  First of all, I would like to systematize my experience in order to develop further.  We have a working system, where my participation is now minimal.  I am sure that, having finished this work, I will have a clear vision of where to go next.  And your questions and comments, your experience of using our developments will also help in this. <br><br><h3>  Why do you need it? </h3><br>  I am sure that if you listen to the advice, then in 2-3 years you can build a company that will make a profit every month, say, with a brand new foreign car (unless of course you don‚Äôt invest everything in development :) And you can spend 2 years of your life and be disappointed in this business.  You decide. <br><br>  Be prepared that in the technology that I will describe there are many places that can be improved, and for some people they have already been solved.  Fine.  We will develop together.  We are not at the beginning, we are in the middle of the road. <br><br><h3>  So a couple of words about WebCanape </h3><br>  Today, <a href="http://www.web-canape.ru/">WebCanape</a> processes approximately 120 applications for the development of the site per month, 80 applications for advertising and promotion, issues 30-40 sites, enters the top 100 studios according to cmsmagazine and most importantly, enters the top 3 (out of 5000 studios) who work with budgets up to 100,000 rubles.  Why is it important?  Because clients with budgets less than 100,000 rubles are the majority, it‚Äôs easier to find a beginner studio, but it‚Äôs hardest to work with them (to be profitable).  Anyone who learns to do this - can be calm for their future.  You do not depend on a specific client.  Even if someone pulls in with payment, you will have the means to pay the RFP.  If you think this is nothing, then I will tell you that it is on this trifle that most of the studios are closed. <br><br>  For some, our indicators look impressive, but for someone it is not much at all.  In fact, it does not matter a lot or a little.  Everything is very relative and everyone decides for himself.  The most important thing is that this is a system and it works.  Works and performs the basic rule - the creation of value and the systematic extraction of profits. <br><br>  Due to what you can earn more - the price.  WebCanape works at a minimal price.  For us it was a matter of principle.  We tested ourselves for strength and created conditions in which innovations can be born that can overcome difficulties.  I can say with great confidence that something we do can be sold more expensive, which is what some of our partners are doing.  If we increase prices by 30%, our turnover will increase by 30 percent, our profits will increase by 30%.  This is substantial money, and for customers it will not be so noticeable. <br><br>  This is the chart that hangs in the WebCanape office and every day we see how we are closer to the intended results. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/758/a13/378/758a13378997417da5e823236f11179a.jpg"><br><br>  You will also approach your goal every day. <br><br><h3>  And in the conclusion about the budget sites </h3><br>  And let someone tell you that you are doing ‚Äú <s>shit</s> budget sites.‚Äù  Do not rush to respond to this.  You make websites that really help a business to earn its first money.  Just learn how to do it well and quickly.  Our client "Rehau Portal" started from the site for 12 000 rubles.  Today, he has a turnover of only advertising 40 times the cost of the site.  He continues to work with us and is in the first lines of the search.  Together with him and we earn.  Our client, Sushi To-Se, today has more than a hundred orders and goes to other regions.  He also started from the site for 12 000. <br><br><h3>  How will I build my story? </h3><br>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/twins/blog/309608/">1) Business planning work web studio</a> <br>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/twins/blog/310568/">2) Team, roles and responsibilities</a> <br>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/twins/blog/311380/">3) Product formation: hours, time, profitability</a> <br>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/twins/blog/313550/">4) Set up business processes in CRM and order chain</a> <br>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/twins/blog/332412/">5) Virtual site development pipeline and automation</a> <br>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/twins/blog/333456/">6) The last mile or how to pass the finished site to the client</a> <br>  7) Monitoring of production work - necessary metrics <br>  8) Setting up a staff motivation system <br>  9) Organization of work support services <br>  10) Organization of the work of the advertising and promotion department <br>  11) Meetings, debriefing, planning and control <br>  12) Analytics, decision making technique <br>  13) Employees: search, involvement, growth system (basic characteristic of a person) <br>  14) Office organization <br>  15) PR studios <br><br>  In the course of the description, I will share the tools that we use.
