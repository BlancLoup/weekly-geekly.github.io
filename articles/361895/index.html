  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Is Leap.it a real Google threat?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently, the former executive director of AOL Inc.  Steve Case held another start-up competition, in which the winner was a new search engine Leap.it.  It would seem, why the world has another search engine?  What is new, they suggested that they hit the jackpot in the amount of 100 thousand dollars, and even received 3 million investments?  Let's see. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  According to the developers themselves, their main difference is as follows: <br><blockquote>  The search engine is socially based.  Search results depend on networks and other networks, which are then integrated with web results. <br>  <i>Forbes</i> </blockquote><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Hidden text</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  [Our] search engine is built on a social basis.  Search results depend on the number of mentions on Twitter and other social networks, and then they are integrated with the obtained web results. </div></div><br>  That is, the relevance of the issue is determined not only by the indexing of the site on the network, but also by the number of its mentions on social networks, first of all, on Twitter.  Among other things, the following two features can be distinguished from the special features of the new search engine: they are not output as links, but are visualized (which has a negative effect on the formation of the result page), and ‚Äúprospects‚Äù - group queries.  These very ‚Äúperspectives‚Äù allow in theory to get something meaningful for requests like: <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúBest Actors of the Past 50 Years‚Äù or the best amusement park rides. <br>  <i>Forbes</i> </blockquote><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Hidden text</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  "The best actors in the last 50 years" or what to do in New York or the best amusement park. </div></div><br>  But the key word, as always, is ‚Äúin theory‚Äù.  I decided to conduct my own test and compare Leap.it and Google on requests other than those that were kindly provided by Forbes as an example from the creators of the search engine (on these specific three requests, by the way, Leap.it really gave meaningful information to " prospects ", but Google didn‚Äôt put pressure).  Russian-speaking Twitter is quite extensive, so I thought it would be fair to enter requests in Russian. <br>  So, the first request from the category of ‚Äúthat is easier‚Äù: the best actors in 20 years.  Google's results, despite the fact that he gave only links to the site, and not himself assessed the situation, is nevertheless more informative, rather than the results of Leap.it.  By the way, in the issuance of Leap.it, English-language sites still somehow started.  So there is no doubt 1: 0 in favor of Google. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0f9/1a8/71b/0f91a871b8fd30e59369246b816eff90.jpg" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/586/2d4/c11/5862d4c112fe905830cf49652cdb7bfc.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Warm up over.  Next request: the best song in human history.  You all see for yourself.  2: 0 <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c3d/1b1/299/c3d1b12994ff0a9be55bc6f83b21603e.jpg" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/30f/158/b56/30f158b564c57044a3cba1c9d1fc13c2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And the last question that worries many: what is the meaning of life?  Google in the case gave the first link to Wikipedia, Leap.it - ‚Äã‚Äãincomprehensible freaks.  3: 0. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/71d/272/aea/71d272aea1ad9b1f8b29733ae2973c6c.jpg" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8b1/560/393/8b156039336b735bd4742bb84ebcdb52.jpg" alt="image">

      So, in a fair fight won Google. <br><br>  Of course, this whole test is just a joke.  Leap.it is a really interesting idea that has a lot of potential, but at the moment the system is still very raw and not finished.  Developers will have to do a lot more, for example, to speed up the loading time of the results and optimize for different languages.  Can Leap.it be a threat to Google?  At the moment, it is unlikely.  The Google search robot is incomparable to anything in the search for information, which is the main direction of the search giant, but in the ‚Äúsocial search‚Äù niche it is still inferior to Leap.it.  On the other hand, for the entire existence of Google, loyal fans and fans gathered around it, what can I say, a whole cult of Google has formed, which Leap.it.  On the third hand, Google and Leap.it are not competitors at all due to the different search directions.  So the loud statement of the founders of Leap.it about their calling Google is nothing more than PR and empty words.  At least for now. <br><br>  // PS Thanks to those who pointed out the broken pictures to me. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/361895/">https://habr.com/ru/post/361895/</a></p>
