  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Little trick - great opportunity. Keyword Optimization</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Prehistory  Yesterday, Apple sent me a letter of happiness that my program violates the copyrights of one company.  Of course, I use their trademark.  Of course, I immediately began to understand that yes, as I discovered a registered trademark in the list of my keywords for the English localization of the application.  It turned out there, thanks to the SensorTower keyword service.  This keyword was hotly recommended to me, in terms of the traffic generated / ease of getting to the top.  I got to the top, but how it turned out.  And further developments have led me to the realization of one interesting feature of the App Store about which I want to tell you. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/68b/2d7/756/68b2d775673bf134b4bdf16474ccec40.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  My application is sold (well, as it is sold - distributed) all over the world and has two localizations.  English and Russian.  At the same time, the entire audience of the application is concentrated in Russia.  Percentage of users - 97.3.  I begin to frantically check the Russian localization and breathe out with joy, when the word-which-it-is-impossible to speak there does not reveal. <br><br>  Then everything is simple.  I delete the application from all markets except Russia.  I am writing an apology letter to two addresses: Apple and the copyright holder (I really wish I had smoked the issue of copyright, but stupidly trusted the service).  I inform you that with the next update I will delete the keyword in the English-speaking market, but in order not to annoy anyone, I remove the application from there in principle.  But I will leave it in Russia because there is no trademark in the keywords there (I don‚Äôt seem to break anything).  With a sinking heart, waiting for an answer.

      A few hours later they write - thanks.  See that you removed from the United States.  But the bad luck from Russia is not.  We ought to do something about it.  I fall into a stupor.  I count to ten and start thinking.  The first thing I write is the answer, that this is the way, and so your keyword is not in the Russian locale.  I attach a screenshot.  I write something there further.  Sorry.  Update.  Please forgive me. <br><br>  I go to the iTunes App Store, the one that is Russian.  I check twice that I am in a Russian shop.  I drive into the search for a trademark.  Voila, on the 3rd place right after the copyright holder I see my application.  Check again that I am in the Russian market.  I enter the request and again I see myself.  I repeat the procedure on the phone - the result is the same.  I add to the letter what is going on some sort of nonsense.  In the keywords in the Russian locale you do not have, but in the issue according to your word really is.  I say that I will update everything in the coming days, but apparently there is some App Store feature or bug, and I hope for a comment from an Apple representative. <br><br>  From all the above, I make a simple but <b>very interesting conclusion</b> : <br>  The application in the Russian App Store is wonderfully located by the keywords and the name of the application from the English localization.  What can help you to optimize your keywords well for the Russian market if you, like me, have keywords duplicated in some places. <br><br>  Having a little bit gone deep into a question it is possible to notice that the similar hack works also for other locales.  For example, I checked German and French localizations of another application of mine.  In the absence of some keywords from the English locale in the German and French applications, these missing keywords are successfully located.  That is, you can have a double set of keywords for each localization of English + locale.  Thus, having not 100 characters for keywords, but consider that 200. Believe me, this is very useful.  I was thus able to remove duplicates from German, Russian and French localizations and add more keywords to each locale, and these are additional downloads and the best places in the top, and as a result, money.  More money.  More money :) <br><br>  This is probably a well-known fact, but after reading a little Habr on this topic and googling, I did not find a single similar topic.  So I will be glad if the developers will help my observation. <br><br>  Well, we should not forget to draw <b>another conclusion</b> : <br>  Do not use registered trademarks in your keywords.  This is not good.  This violates the copyright and leads to negative consequences, including the need to discontinue the application before the update is released with the corrected keywords. <br><br>  I hope you had a good time and learned something new for yourself.  Thanks for attention! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/206592/">https://habr.com/ru/post/206592/</a></p>
