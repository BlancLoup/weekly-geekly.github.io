  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Not a very brief reminder of the passage of DHL parcel customs clearance</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Thanks to my own stupidity, I was pleased with the fascinating procedure of customs clearance of a parcel at DHL, despite the abundance of horrors described in the network, the procedure went quite smoothly, although it took a decent amount of time.  In order to reduce the time spent by the habra people who still have to perform this action (and myself if the sclerosis tortures), I am writing this memo in order to have before me a clear and working plan of action.  I am writing focusing primarily on Moscow, so I will be glad to hear additions to other cities and countries. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Lyrical digression for those who are not familiar with the pleasures of orders in our country.  It is best to ship goods from abroad by regular mail (indicated in stores as Air Mail / USPS), or in case of emergency EMS, for goods under 5,000.  In this case, the package will get to you without hassle and extra costs, although you may have to wait (a week around the world and two weeks in Russia is a normal situation).  If you managed to get on the delivery of DHL / FedEx / USP (the seller is paranoid) - get ready to fork out. <br><br>  Action plan: <br>  1. When we receive a shipment message from the seller, we begin to track where our package is located using the airway bill number reported by the seller (aka tracking number).  You can track it either on dhl.ru, or on third-party services, for example <a href="http://boxoh.com/">boxoh.com</a> .  After 3-4 days the parcel should arrive at customs.  Theoretically, at this moment you should be notified from DHL.  In practice, I could not find 5 working days, by two phones, both of which were near me all the time, well, you understood.

      <br>
      The moment of arrival of the parcel and departure to customs can be indicated, for example, by the following entries. <br><br>  Monday, November 23, 2009 <br>  Cargo is in the process of customs clearance North of Moscow - Russian Federation, The <br>  Friday, November 20, 2009 <br>  Departure is in the process of customs clearance North of Moscow - Russian Federation, The <br>  The shipment arrived at the DHL transit point at &lt;&gt; North of Moscow - Russian Federation, The <br><br>  2. We will assume that you have not received a call, we take the initiative and call the number (495) 956-1000, we ask you to find out who is responsible for your package, for this we inform you the invoice number.  You must be given the name of the employee assigned to the package and its extension number.  In my case, the employee was absent, but the girl from the reception left a message (just in case I repeated my contact details to her).  By the way, they contacted me only every other day. <br><br>  3. There comes a moment of difficult choice.  You can pay a small amount for brokerage services (2500 in my case) and continue to enjoy life.  But, of course, this is not an option for real men.  Therefore, we inform the employee of DHL that we will be the customs.  He \ She will ask for your e-mail address in which the <b>invoice</b> and <b>invoice</b> will be sent, as well as the address, working hours and extension number of the customs commissioner.  If suddenly you are told that he will not communicate with you, or that you have to pay for the movement of documents, you can safely stand in a pose and demand documents (it took my brother to go through the customs clearance procedure in misfortune).  You are required to issue these documents and you do not need to pay money for them.  Be prepared that the customs commissioner works at the most inconvenient hours.  In my case (I do not know if he is alone there), the work time was from 10 to 11 and from 14 to 15, on weekdays minus Thursday. <br><br>  4. We start collecting documents.  We make a photocopy of the passport (page with photo and registration), print the invoice and invoice.  We make a printout of the online store page / price list / etc where the price of the goods is indicated.  We make a printout of the document on which you can understand that you have been charged money for the goods.  In my case, it was a printout of a letter from paypal indicating the size of the debit from the card and extracting debits on the card account.  Since I have a card from a savings bank, I had to go to the branch where I received the card (rays of diarrhea to the employees of the savings bank who did not manage to send me to where it should go right away) and get a statement of the account with the seal of the branch and the signature of the issuer.  At the same time, we‚Äôll print a letter from the DHL employee; it will contain his name and telephone number for communication. <br><br>  5. Preparing for customs clearance.  First of all, we climb onto the site <a href="http://www.tks.ru/db/tnved/tree">www.tks.ru/db/tnved/tree</a> and look for the item that most reflects the contents of each element of the package, then click on the percent sign and record the following data. <br>  1. Directly code <br>  2. Amount of duty <br>  3. VAT rate <br><br>  We consider how much money we need to take: 250r + (the amount of the purchase on the day of customs clearance * duty * VAT).  Those.  if the duty is 15% (for example, photographic equipment), then you pay extra 35.7% (100% * 1.15 * 1.18) of the price (a lot, but very often it still turns out cheaper than buying from us) <br><br>  6. We prepare documents for the customs commission.  Honestly to say that this item did not work for me.  2 papers are required - an application for admission to customs, indicating that the parcel will be used for personal purposes and a list of the contents of the parcel, indicating the TN VED codes and cost.  I honestly tried to search for them online for at least a couple of hours.  So if someone knows where to find these documents, please unsubscribe.  In any case, the commissioner will issue these documents, but it would be possible to fill them in advance. <br><br>  7. We are going to DHL, at st. 8, Marta St., 14.  On the approach we see - on the left a beautiful yellow house, and on the right are storage rooms behind the fence.  We need to go to the warehouse, through the entrance with the guard and then right up to the sign "service department".  Inside, there will be a reception right in front of you, it‚Äôs not necessary there, but the door to the right is necessary. <br><br>  8. Fill out the documents (it is worth taking your own pen) or return the already completed ones to the commissioner.  Potentially answer questions on the load.  My question caused a difference of 20 euro between the invoice and the price in the store, I had to explain that this is the difference in the rates on the day of purchase + conversion between the card in euros, payment in dollars and depositing funds in rubles for it.  At this stage, it is worth remembering that the commissioner is not an employee of the DHL, well, calmly answer questions.  At the end of the paperwork, the commissioner will tell you that the reception should receive a letter with an invoice. <br><br>  9. We speed up the process, at the exit from the Komissar we immediately call the employee with whom we communicated for the first time about the parcel (so as not to look for the phone by name and recommend printing the letter), we inform you that we‚Äôve finished with the Commissioner and ask you to send the parcel to the mail documents.  This can theoretically not be done, but I lost an extra hour because of this (and the person who was passing in parallel, but the person tied to another employee did not have to do anything, but was reinstated).  Within 30 minutes the documents for payment should come, pay them. <br><br>  10. If you wish, you can immediately receive the parcel, but since this may require a decent wait, I have gone home with a sense of accomplishment.  Those who wish to receive the package can immediately once again pull the employee of DHL with whom they spoke in clause 9, tell him that you paid for everything and ask if you can pick up the cargo today.  If possible, he will forward the parcel to the reception, where you will pick it up. <br><br>  As a small resume - if the whole process is prepared in advance, it will take about two hours, the main thing is to understand that DHL is a rash-bureaucratic machine that wants money, so you have to kick it as often as possible. <br><br>  Additions, corrections and personal experiences are very welcome. <br><br><h4>  Article Amendments </h4><br>  Correct cost limits for customs: <br>  Mail - to 10.000r. <br>  Courier service - up to 5.000r. <br><br>  Mail is Russian Post and EMS Russian Post. <br>  Courier service - this is all sorts of DHL, FedEx, Pony Express, etc. <br><br>  Thank you <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/oisee/" class="user_link">oisee</a> and <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/oisee/" class="user_link">lazarus</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/77306/">https://habr.com/ru/post/77306/</a></p>
