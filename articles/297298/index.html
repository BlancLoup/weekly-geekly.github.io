That is what their value is.  Testing helps us to understand whether our hypothesis is correct, how accurately we defined the target audience and how we understood its problems, values, selection criteria, and how exactly we got into it with a selling text, landing page, website, ad.  Let's start testing. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Let me remind you in the past parts we have disassembled: <br>  <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/spagece/blog/21258/">1.

      If we learned all the information from real customers, then this test can be skipped.  If we determine the benefits of customers, taking their place and thinking through their behavior, then we need to strictly test them with the real world, real people.  The more people who confirm our thoughts through testing, the better.  Even if we had experience in dealing with customers, another test will never be over. <br><br>  The greatest number of respondents gives the most accurate understanding of ‚Äúwhat customers want‚Äù, which means we can offer the best solution to their problem and therefore we will earn more. <br><br>  Who to find out? <br><ul><li>  Family (especially mom) </li><li>  Friends </li><li>  Business partners </li><li>  Target audience habitats (forums, groups in social networks, thematic sites, shopping centers, shops) </li><li>  Our potential customers </li></ul><br><br>  Show the target audience the written benefits, look at their reaction.  What suggestions are potentially interesting?  Would they like to buy something? <br><br>  The best test, of course, is to talk with real customers and learn from them. <br><br>  How to find out?  Here are some questions that will help you think in the right direction. <br><ol><li>  I have such an offer for you ... </li><li>  You are interested?  Like?  Would you like to buy? </li><li>  What could be added to make you interested? </li><li>  What is the most important factor when making a decision? </li><li>  What do you pay the most attention to when choosing? </li><li>  What do not you like? </li><li>  What is more important to you?  Speed ‚Äã‚Äãor quality?  Warranty or technical support? </li><li>  Etc. </li></ol><br><br><blockquote>  <font color="#5bbd72">What to do:</font> <font color="#5bbd72"><br></font> <ol><li>  Write out 20 - 30 benefits (what the client will receive when working with you) for the selected avatar </li><li>  To conduct a crash test on real people </li><li>  Highlight the most important benefits (5 pieces) using the crash test </li></ol></blockquote><br><br><h2>  <font color="#5b6166">Highlighting benefits and creating a unique sales offer.</font> </h2><br><br>  As a result of the past crash test assignment, we received 5 of the most powerful benefits.  We allocate 2 - 3 benefits from them and combine them into 3 different unique trade offers (USP). <br><br>  Now read what happened.  UTP makes you interested?  After reading the text I want to know more? <br>  In people, when reading your UTP, the thoughts in your head should be something like this: <br><ul><li>  This is very interesting, we should see ... </li><li>  Wow  I have not seen this yet, and what else can they do? </li><li>  An interesting offer, let's see more ... </li><li>  Come on?  How do they do it? </li><li>  Can you really  I want to know exactly what you can ... </li><li>  Etc. </li></ul><br><br>  Your UTP must necessarily cling when reading.  This is important, since we have a moment in time when a potential client saw our UTP interested in them, or threw a leaflet into the ballot box, ignored the ad and left the site.  UTP should be so strong that an adequate sane person could not refuse him, could not click, did not fill out an application.  And after reading it, I did not close my browser, but continued to look at what we offer it.  It is very important. <br><br>  Again, get an opinion from the side.  For which of the 3 UTP would potential avatars be more likely to buy?  Or which USP is more interested in them. <br><br><blockquote>  <font color="#5bbd72">What to do?</font> <font color="#5bbd72"><br></font> <ol><li>  Combine 3 different TSS </li><li>  Add to smart card </li><li>  Test USP </li></ol></blockquote><br><br><h1>  <font color="#5b6166">Analyzing competitors</font> </h1><br><br>  People want to buy uniqueness, they want to be different.  If you can stand out, this will be the strongest USP. <br><br>  It is clear to be individual, you need to know what others are offering.  It may happen that your UTP, which you invented, may be identical with the UTP of competitors. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#5b6166">How to find out where and what are your competitors?</font> </h2><br><br>  We need to understand who our competitors are and where.  Here it is important to understand that if we want to advertise through Yandex Direct, then we need to look for competitors in Direct.  If we want through VKontakte, then, accordingly, we are looking for competitors there.  This is necessary so that we are different from the competitor in this channel, and our USP is stronger. <br><br>  We are looking for competitors in various channels of attraction.  It is important for us to imitate the behavior of a client in a certain place at a certain time.  What conditions must be met when searching for competitors: <br><ul><li>  Time (working hours or only at night, working days or only holidays, weekends) </li><li>  Location (geography, metro, city, district, region, etc.) </li><li>  Traffic channel (Yandex Direct, Google Adwords, Vnoktakte, Facebook, classmates, teaser networks, etc.) </li></ul><br><br>  For example, for contextual advertising, look for the same requests at the same time, in which you can look for customers.  Because it may happen that your customers are looking for products / services only during business hours, and competitors are advertised during these hours, but advertising is turned off at night.  Therefore, if you search for competitors at night, they will not be.  If social networks, then create an account that matches your target audience and see what your competitors offer you. <br><br>  <a href="https://goo.gl/Hosmcv">Download Excel file with competitor comparison table&gt;</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/758/420/d62/758420d622de48a2b04045d18a5a6adf.jpg"><br>  <i>Comparison table</i> <br><br><blockquote>  <font color="#5bbd72">What to do:</font> <font color="#5bbd72"><br></font> <ol><li>  Simulate customer behavior at the right time, place, and traffic channel </li><li>  See what your 20 competitors offer </li><li>  To call competitors (to find out what is being offered, plus you can find out approximate scripts of competitors and find out additional benefits) </li><li>  Make a comparison table, what benefits are offered and needs are closed </li></ol></blockquote><br><br><h2>  <font color="#5b6166">What to do with all this?</font> </h2><br><br>  You wrote out and compared what your competitors are offering.  Next, find their weak points and offer their strong benefits.  Or block their benefits to their benefits.  See what they offer.  Can you do better?  Can you deliver faster?  Or do you have a better product?  Or can you offer superior service?  Or your competitors have only one, two benefits?  Gather your strengths and make cool suggestions to your visitors. <br><br>  The ideal UTP is of two kinds. <br>  1. When you can not buy.  This is the fear of being stupid if you do not take advantage of the offer here and now, because it is very profitable. <br>  2. Initially, you do not need it, but you look at the offer and it is so cool and unique that you really want to buy. <br><br>  You need to make this combination of 2x, 3x, 4x benefits that no one has. <br>  Or be a little better for any benefits that competitors have. <br><br>  <em>Examples:</em> <em><br></em>  <em>- All offer a year guarantee, give 2 years.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>- All offer installation in a week, offer for 5 days.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>- All call back in 30 minutes, make in 26 seconds.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>- All I offer a free consultation, give free chocolate.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>- All give gifts, give a free course "How not to be mistaken when choosing a company in your niche" in exchange for contacts.</em> <em><br></em> <br><br>  The main thing is that you yourself could really realize these benefits.  Write honestly only what you can give to the client, otherwise the result will be deplorable.  Truthfulness and honesty is that you can give the client a very important thing.  Yes, and do not forget to check whether you will not start working at a loss by making a very strong USP. <br><br><blockquote>  <font color="#5b6166">What to do?</font> <font color="#5b6166"><br></font> <ol><li>  Find the weak points of competitors </li><li>  Adjust your benefits </li><li>  Create new strong UTP better than competitors </li></ol></blockquote><br><br>  That's all.  This part is small, but there is a lot of work behind it.  Since we have a practical course, we give information in approximately equal pieces in terms of homework. <br><br>  In the next chapter I will talk about the fundamental understanding of online business.  I will share the simplest models that will add the correct picture, what and how to do. <br><br>  <b>PS</b> <br><br>  We are always happy to help, the <a href="https://spagece.com/%3Futm_source%3Dmegam%26utm_medium%3Dcontent%26utm_content%3Dkurs-lp-part4">Spagece</a> team is a service for easy and fast creation of websites (Landing Page, subscription pages, events, conferences, webinars, personal pages, small online stores, etc.) for your tasks. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297298/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297298/</a></p>
