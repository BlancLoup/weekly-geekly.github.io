Now everyone can find out how much they earn in this or that IT field.  The scheme of the service is simple: you tell ‚ÄúMy Circle‚Äù your salary, and in return you get access to a database of any other salaries in the market.  <a href="https://moikrug.ru/salaries">Try our new payroll service</a> . <br><br>  We display wages in aggregated form: we show the average and median, minimum and maximum wages.  The service guarantees complete privacy and anonymity of your payroll data.  After making a salary in the database, no one will see it separately from other salaries, including yourself. <br><br> <a href="https://moikrug.ru/salaries"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fb9/497/329/fb9497329cd39fa00457a8abf4d5a63b.png"></a>

      Further we will tell in more detail how everything works. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><hr><br>  To get access to the entire accumulated salary service, you first need to make your own.  When making a salary, you must still, at a minimum, indicate your specialization.  Additionally, you can clarify your qualifications, main professional skills, work distance, full working day, city of residence and company in which you work. <br><br>  After that, you will be able to recognize salaries by any of the above parameters. <br><br>  The more parameters you set, the less likely you will receive an exact salary for them.  Indeed, with each additional parameter, the number of salaries collected by the service decreases. <br><br><h3>  About the catalog of specializations </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/958/661/9ed/9586619edaf10c5a890d928f3735cd70.png"><br><br>  In the IT community there is no strictly approved directory of specializations: so that everyone calls the same positions with the same names.  And this is typical both for the Russian-speaking community and for the English-speaking one.  And this is understandable, because the IT industry is booming, a new specialization may appear here every day, which did not exist before (of the latter, which are very popular, Devops, for example). <br><br>  Therefore, in our catalog, we do not pretend to the ultimate truth.  It is compiled on the basis of our own experience in the industry, as well as on the basis of a series of surveys <a href="https://vk.com/wall-46638176%3Fq%3D%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%2520%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D1%2584%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9%2520%25D0%25B8%2520%25D1%2581%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B5%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9">that we conducted in VK groups</a> ‚ÄúMy Circle‚Äù and ‚ÄúHabrahabr‚Äù. <br><br>  We would be grateful for constructive criticism and suggestions for improving the catalog.  The main thing is that it is not very large, but would accommodate most of the specializations that now exist in IT. <br><br><h3>  Some rules for calculating salaries </h3><br><ul><li>  If you enter several salaries, the service will take into account only the one you entered last. <br></li><li>  Wages that are very different from all others are not taken into account: both in the smaller and in the larger direction. <br></li><li>  On a small number of data, we do not show any salaries, believing that the calculation will be too inaccurate. <br></li></ul><br><h3>  About average and median wages </h3><br>  Of course, many people know how the average salary differs from the median.  But nevertheless it will not hurt to once again clarify. <br><br>  So, the average salary, which is also arithmetic average, is the sum of all salaries divided by the number of these salaries.  That is, this is the salary that we get if we take away all their salaries and then divide them equally.  You must admit that it is a somewhat strange quantity, which speaks little about what happens to everyone in reality. <br><br>  The median salary is the salary that lies exactly in the middle of all the salaries, if you decompose them one after another, ordering from the lowest to the highest.  That is, half of the salary people are the same or higher than the median, and half - the same or lower.  This figure already tells us a lot. <br><br>  At one time, my colleagues and I joked that the average wage could be called the ‚Äúaverage communist‚Äù and the median, the ‚Äúaverage capitalist‚Äù.  Indeed, in the first case, we show how much each will have if we divide equally between all.  And in the second - how much poorer or richer each of us is relative to the statistical center. <br><br><hr><br>  ps Any salary, if it is drawn in the form of a diagram on the screen, you can download the picture.  This picture is the cover of this publication. <br><br>  Any salary can also be shared on the social network.  We developed special cards to make the patch look beautiful when shared. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/820/d7b/45b/820d7b45b124279e94520e135421bc04.png"><br><br><hr><br>  As far as we know, in Russia there has not yet been such a service.  In the US, Europe, Ukraine and Belarus was, and we have not.  Let's create a database on Russian wages all together, which we will share. <br><br>  We invite everyone <a href="https://moikrug.ru/salaries">to experience our new salary service</a> ! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/343578/">https://habr.com/ru/post/343578/</a></p>
