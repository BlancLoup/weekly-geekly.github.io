Without brakes, freezes, delays of audio or video tracks from each other, and vice versa - in the original quality and with all the pluses arising from viewing this format, like on your home FullHD panel.  Absolutely it will not be important and the fact that you have the weakest Windows Mobile device with a screen ranging from 176x220 to WVGA. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ebb/d3d/14f/ebbd3d14f1e8c23833006d343e14128f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Mobiclip</b> (.mo format) is a very advanced technology that allows you to play video files, flash-animation in full screen mode, play tunes.  You can also play full-fledged flash-video games;  use animated calls (flash), video calls;  present and function karaoke. <br>  <b>Mobiclip</b> is really a progressive technology, as it works on low-end devices: a processor of 16 Mhz (ARM7 runs at this frequency)!  True, the whole joke lies in the fact that Mobiclip Player is distributed free of charge, whereas Mobiclip Converter is distributed only among developers and costs a fortune.  In addition, Mobiclip Converter - is only a beta version. <br><br>  To convert video to .mo format, of course, you need the Mobiclip Converter itself, which weighs 21323 Kb (already in the archive).  In addition, the converter does not start without Microsoft .Net Frameworks 1.1, which can be downloaded from the manufacturer‚Äôs website for free, weighs a miracle package of 23697 Kb (already in the archive).  And to convert the video will need VirtualDub, weighing 893 Kb (already in the archive VirtualDub 1.9.0.30586 Russian Version + Plugins). <br>  So, after downloading and installing the necessary programs (Mobiclip Converter, Microsoft .Net Frameworks 1.1, VirtualDub), you can start working.

      <b>Instructions for converting video to .mo format</b> : <br>  1) Run VirtualDub, and open the source file, for example video.avi <br>  2) In the "Video" menu, select "Full mode" <br>  3) In the ‚ÄúVideo‚Äù menu, open ‚ÄúCompression‚Äù and select the video codec from the list presented - Actimagine Mobiclip Video Codec <br>  4) Click on the ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù button and move the slider from 75% to 70%, with the help of which we adjust Image Quality, that is, the picture quality.  How do you understand the quality of the picture you can experiment <br>  5) In the "Video" menu, select "Frame Rate" and set the selective button on the Process every other frame (decimate by 2), this changes the frame rate from 30 fps to 25 fps <br>  6) In the "Video" menu, select "Filters".  There are a lot of filters in the ‚ÄúFilters‚Äù menu, you can experiment with them, but we will consider only the necessary ones.  Click on the ‚ÄúAdd‚Äù button and add the Resize filter.  Change the size: in the line "New width" we write, for example, 640;  in the row of new height, we register 480. In the line ‚ÄúFilter mode‚Äù we put Precise bicubic.  After that you can click on the ‚ÄúView‚Äù button and see what we have done.  Regarding Windows Mobile (the display ranges from 176 to 220 and up to 480 to 800), the Scope width and New height values ‚Äã‚Äãmay vary. <br>  7) In the ‚ÄúFilters‚Äù menu, click on the ‚ÄúAdd‚Äù button and add the Rotate filter, with which we are offered to rotate the image: Left by 90, Right by 90, Around 180 - that is, to the left 90, to the right 90, around 180 Now happy owners of PDAs can watch the video in a normal way. <br>  8) In the "Audio" menu, select "Full mode" <br>  9) In the "Audio" menu, open "Compression" and make sure that there is No Compression (PCM) <br>  10) In the menu "Audio" choose "Conversion".  In the "Conversion" set the selective buttons 48000 Hz, High quality, 16 <br>  bits, Stereo (or put ticks ‚ÄúNo change‚Äù everywhere) <br>  11) In the "File" menu, click on "Save Processing Parameters", and write the name, for example, Mobiclip.vcf.  Thus, we have saved all the installations so that next time we don‚Äôt have to install them again. <br>  12) Finally, in the ‚ÄúFile‚Äù menu, click on ‚ÄúSave as AVI‚Äù, and enter a name, for example, videoclip.avi.  We look at how the conversion process takes place before our eyes.  Close VirtualDub <br>  13) Now open the directory where we saved the videoclip.avi (we can look at any player).  Right-click on videoclip.avi, and in the drop-down menu select Convert to Mobiclip (.mo).  After converting in the same directory where videoclip.avi is located, videoclip.mo appears <br>  I can congratulate you, after these hellish works, we can look at what we did!  We open videoclip.mo and look at what we did (Mobiclip Player For Windows OS is included in the converter).  Now with the help of ActiceSync and X-device or similar, we transfer videoclip.mo to microSD (HS) (who has which card) to the mobiclip folder (that is, your memory card: mobiclip to disk).  Or simply send to our device as a message. <br><br>  <b>Note</b> : <br>  All the instructions for converting video in the .mo format must be strictly followed, otherwise it will not work. <br>  Use Mobiclip Player for Windows Mobile, which is part of Mobiclip Converter or download a separate client from this site.  It is located in the directory in which you installed Mobiclip Converter.  For example, I have a Mobiclip Player for Windows Mobile located in "C: Program FilesActimagineMobiclip (beta) PlayerMobiclip-sp2003".  Mobiclip Player must be version 1.83.  The fact is that the craftsmen from Actimagine did not build one important function into their brainchild, most likely on purpose: the newer version does not understand the .mo files of the old player version <br><br>  <b>Instructions for converting flash-animation in .mo format</b> : <br>  To convert flash-animations from .swf to .mo format, we will need Mobiclip Converter, Microsoft .Net Frameworks 1.1, and any tool for creating flash-animations, for example, Macromedia Flash MX. <br><br>  1) Do not use alpha effects, gradient fills, or mask layers <br>  2) Do not use bitmaps as background images. <br>  3) Use only one audio stream. <br>  4) For Macromedia Flash MX itself, in the Modify menu, select Shape and set Convert lines to fills.  The fact is that in <br>  Mobiclip Player does not draw lines <br>  5) In the Library, in the Properties window, uncheck Use imported JPEG data <br>  6) In the File menu, select Publish in the Flash section and set the following values ‚Äã‚Äãfor the sound: Raw, Mono, 44 ‚Äã‚ÄãKhz <br>  7) The frame rate should not be less than 4. It should be optimal, otherwise there will be porty with sound <br>  Now, after creating your own flash-animation and viewing it on a Macromedia Flash Player, right-click on it and select Convert to Mobiclip (.mo) in the drop-down menu.  The resulting flash-movie can be viewed on the computer. <br><br>  <b>Note</b> : <br>  Due to the points described above, the flash-animation downloaded from the network does not quite resemble us: Mobiclip Player turned out to be too moody, it simply does not understand many of the effects characteristic of modern flash-animation. <br>  However, you can download flash-animation in the .swf format, for example, Masyanya and redo it, to do this, run Macromedia Flash MX, select Import from the File menu, specify the source file, for example, Masyanya.swf.  Then you have to redo everything according to the instructions described above. <br>  And one more small nuance: Mobiclip Converter contains MobiclipManual.pdf instruction, which describes Script Limitations <br><br>  Convert video and flash-animation with his own hand.  Works 100% on the RoverPC S6.  I suggest to test the new technology Mobiclip specialists and all comers.  The only problem is the size of the full-screen video (the settings described above were used): converting a .mpg video file of 31.5 Mb in size turned out to be a .mo video file of 10 Mb in size!  When converting flash-animations in the .swf format into the Mobiclip format .mo, the size of the source file does not practically differ from the resulting one: it changes only by 5% -10% (provided that the clip is made by yourself) <br><br>  <b>An example of copying and playback of the received video materials</b> : <br>  For an example, I took a video from a charity concert of the <u>2010 FIFA World Cup ‚Ñ¢ Kick-off Concert</u> of the <u>Black Eyed Peas</u> Group <u>- I Gotta Feeling</u> - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DLLCaOBj7ZHU%26feature%3Dchannel">this is the address on YouTube.ru</a> <br>  When downloading this video from YouTube.ru in the best quality, it will weigh 131.088 MB.  (in MPEG-4 format, FullHD), and after conversion they began to weigh only 34 MB.  At the same time, it remains the same quality with all the ensuing emotions as the original video in 131.088 MB.  After converting it, you will need to place it along this path into the device itself (an example of how I use it): <br> <code>"Storage CardMobiclipugc=Personal_Videosmouqf32oP1Eyniv1PwufqTkFA=Black_Eyed_Peas__I_Gotta_Feeling"</code> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/140188/">https://habr.com/ru/post/140188/</a></p>
