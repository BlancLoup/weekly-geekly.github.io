Last in January 2008 was renamed Parallels.  It is on her that Sergey is now concentrating all his forces, being the general director. <br><br>  Parallels was created by Russian software engineers in Singapore in 1999 (Belousov is a Singaporean citizen).  The company employs about 700 people.  Headquartered in Switzerland.  Development and all technical support - in Moscow and Novosibirsk.

      In recent years, Sergei Belousov gave a <a href="http://www.itpedia.ru/index.php/%25D0%2591%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D1%2583%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2_%25D0%25A1%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9">lot of interviews</a> , including <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/soft/58117/">on Habr√©</a> , <a href="http://www.echo.msk.ru/programs/tochka/629385-echo/">Echo</a> and <a href="http://radio-t.com/podcasts/radio-t-156/">Radio-T</a> ), so it‚Äôs hard to find questions that he hasn‚Äôt answered yet.  Under habrakat - some quotes from his past interviews. <br><br>  If you have any questions for Sergey, ask them in the comments.  As usual, the answers will be published in the same blog. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  ‚ÄúWe do not present ourselves as a super successful company.  The software market is very consolidated, and 85% of this market‚Äôs turnover comes from five companies.  To consider yourself a successful company in this market, you need to grow to a turnover of several billion dollars.  We have not grown to this size yet. ‚Äù <br><br>  ‚ÄúOne of my predictions is that virtualization will be used on virtually every computer device, maybe even on every phone.  A very large number of services will be provided via the Internet. ‚Äù <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe most interesting area for me right now is cloud computing.  For thirty years of revolutionary changes in the field of IT-technologies there were three - the emergence of personal computers, the Internet and client-server architecture.  The concept of cloud computing, data access, when software is provided to the user as an Internet service, is a phenomenon of the same scale. ‚Äù <br><br>  ‚ÄúOne of our main mistakes was the lack of focus.  That is, we are historically trying to focus more and more.  But in fact, with the right business structure, it was necessary to have a stronger focus first, and then somehow blur it into wider market segments. ‚Äù <br><br>  ‚ÄúParallels is often understood to mean a desktop product that actually sold two million copies, so by the number of copies it is our biggest product ... But 70% of our turnover is service providers that provide applications and services for medium and small businesses.  The second area of ‚Äã‚Äãour development - 25% - is desktop virtualization.  Mostly on Mac. <br><br>  "And if we talk about a desktop product, then a portable version may appear sometime, but now there are very many problems with batteries and performance in general on portable devices, all sorts of different glands of iPhone, so use one such device for several operating systems it is still a bit early ‚Äù. <br><br>  ‚ÄúVMware is one of the unique phenomena in the IT market, which is difficult to equal, and we consider the dynamics of its development to be very successful.  But at the start of VMware had a number of important advantages.  First, it still entered the market three years earlier than us.  Secondly, it was based on a solid technological reserve that already existed.  Thirdly, due to circumstances, she was able to immediately get a serious investment.  Fourth, this company was initially focused on a wider market of corporate customers.  And Parallels focused on the service provider market. ‚Äù <br><br>  ‚ÄúI met five years ago with Eric Schmidt, CEO of Google.  Again, about thirty minutes in all.  Not without benefit - I realized that Google does not have an affiliate strategy and therefore is a threat to all IT companies: cooperation with it is impossible. ‚Äù <br><br>  ‚ÄúHaving received‚Äú browser-OS ‚Äùand having already stored a significant part of their data on Google‚Äôs servers, many users will switch to web applications completely (even at the cost of‚Äú minor inconveniences ‚Äù) and will become completely dependent on the‚Äú giant mainframe.  No independent software developer can collaborate with Google, write programs for them - Google users do everything themselves and want to completely control their users.  Diverse support for free software, open standards, and open APIs (spawning a whole family of third-party mashup services) that Google loves to focus on - these are distracting maneuvers. ‚Äù <br><br>  ‚ÄúClouds are a giant change in the way IT services are delivered and consumed.  As the Internet has once changed the lives of private users, so the clouds will change the business, making it meaningless to create (partially or completely) and support its own IT infrastructure.  In the near future we will encounter three types of clouds. <br><br>  1. Platform clouds of very large companies (Google, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, HP, Salesforce), which are proprietary to ALL, what they do (API, software, OS, standard components).  There will not be many such clouds, just as there can not be many operating systems.  Their number will not exceed ten. <br><br>  2. Private clouds, which are mainly tens of thousands of data centers of large commercial enterprises - service providers for themselves (other departments, branches within thousands of companies, etc.). <br><br>  3. Public clouds, numbering hundreds of thousands of service providers (telecommunications companies, hosting providers, SaaS providers), already providing services to businesses.  Their service delivery model is not proprietary. <br><br>  We are convinced that for small and medium-sized businesses (according to the classification, these include enterprises from 1 to 1 thousand people in the state, but a weighted average size of 3-10 people depending on the country) clouds will become the main source of IT services by 2020 year.
