  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Using mental maps for teaching with the example of Cisco CCNA Exploration</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  At the very beginning of teaching at the Cisco Network Academy, I ran into problems that every novice instructor probably faces. <br><br>  Firstly, I did not know how to begin the course of teaching, how much time to devote to teaching the theoretical and practical part, given that about six months are allocated for the entire course. <br><br>  Secondly, what basic concepts students should master for successful mastering of a course and the subsequent passing of examinations.  Faced with such problems, I began to look for solutions.  Having tried many methods, I stopped on mental maps, which in my opinion is, if not an ideal, but a simplifying method in systematizing knowledge.

      What tasks does this article pursue? <br>  1) Give the definition of mental maps; <br>  2) Describe the structure of Cisco CCNA Exploration courses; <br>  3) Show examples of the use of mental maps in this course; <br>  4) Describe the advantages over conventional teaching methods. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Mindmappig or compilation of mental maps is a very effective technique of visualizing tasks, problems, etc.  It can be used to analyze, structure information and solve problems. <br>  The scope of mental maps is extensive from education to business. <br><br>  Tony Buzan, the author of the mind map technique, gives the following tips on the use of mind maps: <br>  instead of linear recording use radial.  This means that the main topic on which our attention will be focused is placed in the center of the sheet.  That is really the focus of attention; <br><br>  write not everything, but only keywords.  The key words are the most characteristic, vivid, remembered, ‚Äúspeaking‚Äù words; <br><br>  keywords are placed on branches diverging from the central theme.  Links (branches) should be associative rather than hierarchical.  Associations are very conducive to memorization and can be supported by symbolic drawings. <br><br>  A little bit away from the topic, to be honest enough, then adhere to the principles of creating mental maps described by Tony Buzan, it does not always work.  For example, the links in the branches are more hierarchical than associative.  I have not fully thought through this moment.  But I am already working in this direction. <br><br>  For more information on the compilation of mental maps, you can read Tony Buzan's book The Book of Intellect Cards: Branched Thinking. <br><br>  Now you can go to the Cisco course and how I used mental maps. <br>  The Cisco CCNA Exploration course has an interrelated hierarchical structure and consists of four parts: <br>  1) Network Fundamentals - Network Basics; <br>  2) Routing Protocols and Concepts ‚Äî Protocols and basic routing concepts; <br>  3) LAN Switching and Wireless-LAN Switching and Wireless Networks; <br>  4) Accessing the WAN-access to the global network. <br><br>  Each part of the course is divided into chapters.  In the first and in the second part there are 11 chapters, in the third 7 and in the fourth 8. In turn, each chapter is also divided into sub-chapters, etc.  Based on the number of chapters in each part, I decided to create a general structure for each part in the form of a mental map.  That's what happened <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fce/715/915/fce715915bcdb01956e3cd81104ac694.jpg"><br>  ( <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/43364368/Cisco/CCNA-Nework%2520Fudamentals.pdf">link</a> to download a higher resolution file in .pdf) <br><br>  I highlighted each chapter of the Network Fundamentals section with a separate color so that later you can easily navigate through the mental map. <br>  Then everything is prosaic.  Each chapter is taken separately and on its basis its own mental map is drawn up. <br>  For example, take the first chapter of the Network Fundamentals-Living in the Network Centric World. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/195/1ff/06b/1951ff06b4dcd7761b2fdabc496cff2b.jpg"><br>  ( <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/43364368/Cisco/Living%2520in%2520Network%2520Centric%2520World.pdf">link</a> to download a higher resolution file in .pdf) <br>  It consists of 7 sub-chapters, including laboratory work, questions and a summary. <br><br>  Highlighting the key concepts of each sub-chapter, I got the hierarchical structure of these concepts in the first chapter of the Network Fundamentals section. <br><br>  After creating such a structure for studying chapters and topics, I found that out of the 2 hours allocated to one topic, the theoretical part takes only about an hour, i.e.  40 to 50 percent of the time left for the practical task, with work on errors and questions. <br><br>  Studying the course as usual, there is the likelihood that students may have difficulty organizing information.  And also with the passage of the new semester, the knowledge gained earlier, can be forgotten.  Therefore, mental maps help students quickly find and recall the material covered. <br><br>  We now turn to what this course study structure provides. <br><br>  Firstly, for instructors, it provides an opportunity to identify the main things that a student must master.  The course itself consists of a large amount of information.  Highlighting the main, the instructor can concentrate the attention of students on the main, thereby increasing the efficiency of mastering information.  Thus, it is possible to allocate more time for the study of practical tasks, which, with the usual methods of teaching, are sorely lacking. <br><br>  Secondly, on the basis of the mental map, you can create additional questions and tests to check the depth of material mastered by students.  And you can vary the variants of tests and questions for each student individually. <br><br>  Thirdly, by working with students, you can supplement and update key concepts on the mental map.  Working together on key concepts also increases the efficiency of material absorption. <br><br>  And fourthly, you can systematize your theoretical and practical knowledge to prepare for passing a Cisco CCNA certificate exam. <br><br>  Conclusion: <br>  This method can be used not only as part of Cisco courses, but also when teaching and learning any other material. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/140644/">https://habr.com/ru/post/140644/</a></p>
