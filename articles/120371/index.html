  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Ebay sniper on a specific example</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  As I did not find a detailed description of the snipers of the ebay auction on Habr√©, I decided to share my own experience.  You will learn what snipers are in general, and how to use one of them in particular. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  When writing an article, I proceeded from the assumption that readers are roughly aware of the structure of online auctions.  For those who have not yet come across this, I will explain (somewhat simplifying) that auctions are of the following types: <br><br>  - time-limited - the lot gets to the one who offers the maximum price during the auction, the winner becomes known at the end of the auction <br>  - with a fixed price - you can buy the product immediately for the specified amount <br>  - there is also a mixed option, when a minimum price is assigned, with which the rate increase starts, and there is a fixed price at which you can buy the lot immediately, completing the auction ahead of schedule. <br><br>  To win a certain lot, you must make the largest bet.  However, this can be quite a tedious process - you have to constantly monitor the status of trades, make new and new bets, be nervous, and fear for your wallet (it‚Äôs no secret that participation in auctions is a very exciting job).  In addition, it is possible that the auction ends late at night, and in the last seconds before the end of the bidding, your internet connection is broken.  This is where the sniper comes to the rescue.

      Sniper is software that facilitates interaction with the auction.  The sniper is applicable to time-limited auctions, while the possibility of ‚Äúbuy now at a fixed price‚Äù may or may not be present.  The idea is simple - you tell the sniper the lot you are interested in and the maximum price you are willing to pay.  A few seconds before the end of the bidding, the sniper makes a bet on your behalf.  If there are bids in the auction that are higher than yours (i.e., higher than the amount you don‚Äôt mind giving up), you lost the auction.  If there are no such bets, then the sniper will place a bet on your behalf, for a minimum value exceeding the maximum existing bet, thus saving some of your money (this mechanism will become clearer from the example below). <br><br>  Snipers are of two types - installed on a computer and web services.  In the first case, you install and configure the program, leave the computer turned on, and hope that at the crucial moment there will be no trouble with your Internet channel.  Honestly, I do not see any reason to use this kind of snipers - it seems to me uncomfortable.  Therefore, we will look at an example of how web snipers work. <br><br>  My favorite sniper is <a href="http://gixen.com/">gixen.com</a> .  You need to log into it under the account that you use on ebay (any sniper will not be able to function if he does not know your login and password from the auction).  Suppose I want to buy <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/Palm-TX-Handheld-PDA-Wi-Fi-Bluetooth-/270758409219%3Fpt%3DPDA_s_Pocket_PC_s%26hash%3Ditem3f0a757403">this</a> lot.  In the form add new snipe: I enter the auction number (eBay Item Number, in this case 270758409219) and my maximum bid (Your bid, say $ 100).  The auction will end in 9 days, so while you can go relax on the sea.  If a few seconds before the end of the auction the current price of the lot will be less than my $ 100, the sniper will bet, and the magic Palm T | X is ours! <br>  For example, if the price of the lot is $ 80, then the bid made by the sniper will be not $ 100, but about $ 82 (current price + minimum step for the next bid). <br><br>  In addition, gixen allows you to group lots.  For example, we really want to buy a Palm T | X, but we only have $ 75 money.  The likelihood that we win the first auction with such a small amount is small.  Therefore, we select several lots of interest to us at once, and put them all in a sniper, placing them in the same group (Bid group).  If one of the lots in the group wins the auction, the sniper automatically cancels all other bets in the group.  This allows you to avoid the risk of accidentally winning five identical lots.  Another gixen offers advanced features for paid users, such as an unlimited number of lots (for ordinary users there is a limit of 10 simultaneously operating lots) and increased fault tolerance.  To become a paid user you need to pay a very small amount, or simply place a link to this service on your website. <br><br>  What you should pay attention to: <br>  - There are many different snipers in the network, and all of them are potentially dangerous, since you give them your ebay login and password.  Therefore, be careful when choosing a sniper. <br>  - gixen bid is accepted in the same currency as for the current auction.  Be careful!  ¬£ 100 is not the same as $ 100! <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/120371/">https://habr.com/ru/post/120371/</a></p>
