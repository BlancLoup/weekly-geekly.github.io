Not at all because of the wrong choice of a career as an information technology specialist.  This is a very, very, very interesting job.  Almost like the work of a space ship captain ...;) <br><br>  I chose companies, but did not choose bosses.  And that was my mistake.  I think that not only mine ... <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  When I decided to become an IT specialist, I had a simple motive: I was tired of tedious higher education, its backwardness from the world level of science and technology ... I wanted to live in a world where something is constantly being created that makes people's lives better.

      And, of course, IT became my world.  And where are the various IT found in the Russian Federation (the third country, by the way, of the world)?  The answer was obvious: where thick budgets are in corporations.  The rest of the normal IT can not afford. <br><br>  And I set off with a light heart. <br><br>  It was terribly interesting and driving.  The familiar technologies from home were transformed into super-reliable structures, merged into corporate systems, packaged into models with different management methods, intertwined with the business processes of the corporation I chose and became their strategic advantages.  You could be an IT architect and gardener in any direction of professional development you know.  Within the allocated budget, of course. <br><br>  But inside me there was still something wrong. <br><br>  Bosses! <br><br>  They often didn‚Äôt care about ‚Äúgrowing the garden‚Äù around them, and they were more and more worried about their own movement.  They also disliked the young / enthusiastic.  Sometimes they were simply ignored, sometimes they openly trampled. <br><br>  - Well, maybe I was not lucky with the boss - I thought.  And changed jobs.  There was a lot of business in the new place: it was necessary to realize the accumulated experience, and then build a lot of new and interesting things.  And the bosses didn't even bother.  But did not help.  Having rolled up my sleeves, I didn‚Äôt pay attention for a long time that something was wrong again.  At the last work I did not notice this for more than one kilodya, to put it ‚Äúour‚Äù language, or, in Russian, a little more than three years;) <br><br>  Everything turned out to be very simple: I chose a job for myself, but did not choose superiors.  I came for an interview, looked at the scope and structure of the tasks, listened to myself - I like / don't like to spend here a couple of years - and I agreed.  True, more often - refused.  Well, not that message - I did not take into account the chiefs with whom I spoke at the interviews.  And in vain. <br><br>  Only when I myself became a leader, I understood why. <br><br>  When you are a boss, your job is to achieve business goals with the hands of subordinates.  When you are a good boss, every day you make a collective of something like a passionate family.  When bad - you just reach your business goals ... <br><br>  Recruitment of a state (not in a startup where it simply hadn‚Äôt been before) is always associated with changes in the business.  Specifically, the CIO who hunt you, either builds a platform for new business processes, or loses quality / performance from changing business requirements to the old ones.  In general, he urgently needs to find someone who will take on this bunch of problems.  His ass can not stand the onslaught, if you say even easier. <br><br>  And here you are sitting at the interview, you think that everything seems to be fine: the prospects of work are sufficient, and the amount of worries is normal for the money offered, and the office has a canteen and gym, and it‚Äôs convenient to go from home to, in general, try on a new job to myself and she never shakes.  Only about the future boss, sitting opposite, you do not think.  Well, it‚Äôs not that you don‚Äôt think at all - the first impression has already been formed, a literate man, it seems, doesn‚Äôt work out.  We work together. <br><br>  As if not so. <br><br>  This part of the interview may cost you lost years.  If the boss does not ‚Äúburn‚Äù with the situation, is not charged for its solution, does not tell enthusiastically what will happen in time, and especially after you build a new technology <b>together</b> , but simply polls, finding out what you are capable of - run out .  You start yuzat. <br><br>  - Well, they use all wage earners, - you will say and you will be 100% right.  But I meant something else: ‚Äúuse‚Äù = make you achieve your goals and give results.  The most important word of the previous phrase: "seek."  ‚ÄúThough kill yourself, but do it,‚Äù is what your boss will say to you once.  He is not interested in what you need, he needs what is important to <b>him</b> .  He makes you lose particles of <b>yourself</b> , breaking into a cake for his plans. <br><br>  Over time, it turns out that your interests in this job are completely unrelated to the list of tasks that the boss puts on you every day.  Although the work itself is wonderful, exciting and beloved.  But to do something is not at all desirable.  And here comes the dissonance: you like work, but you don‚Äôt work.  It is terrible if this state stretches for years - because you lose those years forever. <br><br>  In your favorite work, the result is not as important as the process.  And still the favorite work very much attracts pleasant experiences of achievement of a new level of skill or a new experience. <br><br>  The key word here is "reach."  It is very closely associated with the words "acquire," "gain."  You gain a new charge of energy and strength when you rise to a new level of skill.  Gamers will understand me: level up opens up new horizons in any game.  In life, everything happens the same way. <br><br>  So, if the boss gives you the opportunity to do this - you have a dream job.  Do not pay attention to such details - you have. <br><br>  Over the past 7 years, I changed three jobs.  And each time I achieved more and more success in the next workplace.  But all the time I didn‚Äôt like something, something inside me was out of place. <br><br>  Now I realized that. <br><br>  Choosing a job, you should pay attention not only to the set of tasks in the new place and the conditions of stay at the place of their solution, but also to their source - the boss.  After all, it depends on him whether you will achieve success in it or just achieve it.  And this is a big difference.  For you personally. <br><br>  In one of the reports of the company Gallup on the labor market in the United States was such an epigraph: "Do not leave companies, leave from the heads."  It is appropriate to use it as the moral of the post. <br><br>  PS This is not a translation;) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/113652/">https://habr.com/ru/post/113652/</a></p>
