      Speaking about intellectual driving, we immediately imagine a system that is able to navigate in space and inform the driver (and, in a more perfect version, to independently respond) about the traffic situation in real time.  This solution, called Connected Driving, was developed by HERE, the Nokia business unit, and is the only integrated system in the field of automotive communications and navigation on the market today. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3e8/acf/fa7/3e8acffa7901e6400828af5cd55e5909.png"><br><br>  This solution helps car makers and car systems vendors to establish an effective link between the car, the driver and the cloud service, going beyond navigation only.  Connected Driving can synchronize routes, as well as other personal information between personal devices and the car's ecosystem, find the right parking space or the nearest gas station. <br><br>  Connected Driving is a complete ecosystem and includes services such as HERE Auto, HERE Auto Cloud, HERE Auto Companion and HERE Traffic.  Let's take a closer look at each of them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9c4/56f/bf9/9c456fbf9f875d942459d177b605fb57.png"><br><br>  HERE Auto is the first in-vehicle service that loads the appropriate map fragment at the right time through the data channel or using preloaded maps if the data channel is not available.  Drivers get the opportunity to use step-by-step navigation in 95 countries of the world, as well as a satellite map with an overview of the street level in 2D and 3D format. <br><br>  In the future, HERE partners will have the opportunity to expand the functionality of HERE Auto using the SDK, for example, creating applications for entertainment or working with social networks and music. <br><br>  HERE Auto Cloud is a cloud storage of traffic data from HERE.  The service allows real-time informing drivers about the situation on the roads, helping to drive around the busy sections of the road, closed roads and traffic jams that arise along the route. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/63c/455/2b6/63c4552b65c3aa6a7fac150ba7993909.jpg"><br><br>  HERE Auto Companion, a mobile and web-based application, provides a link between drivers and vehicle systems and systems when they are outside of its cabin.  The service also allows you to synchronize selected points and routes on all devices with support for HERE Connected Driving. <br><br>  Drivers who use the HERE Auto Companion for Android and Windows Phone applications can even remotely determine a vehicle‚Äôs location, exploiting the capabilities of LiveSight augmented reality technology in their device, and check vehicle performance, such as fuel level or tire pressure. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ec1/9ef/cd9/ec19efcd97485a97ec8ded35d35febe7.png"><br><br>  But that‚Äôs not all: the program‚Äôs existing HERE package, such as pedestrian navigation, public transport routes and even building planning schemes, will be available to all of the program‚Äôs partners for developing their own mobile applications. <br><br>  Another important point for the functioning of the system as a whole is the modernization of the HERE Traffic service due to the introduction of Halo, a new data processing module.  HERE constantly increases the amount of high-quality data, such as data from road sensors and sensor systems.  Thanks to fast and accurate data processing, the Halo module provides real-time information about weather, traffic congestion, road works and other factors important to drivers.  Thanks to the HERE Traffic service, drivers get more accurate calculations of travel time, which allows you to plan routes more thoroughly and quickly rebuild them while driving. <br><br><h4>  Tomorrow: "Electronic Horizon" </h4><br><br>  If intellectual driving is the technology of today, what awaits us tomorrow?  It is logical to assume that with the current level of development of automotive technology and road data, the next step will be the introduction of autonomous control.  Today, as never before, we are close to making this concept a reality, a reality that is massive and accessible to everyone.  You shouldn't go far for examples: most modern premium-class cars, like the Mercedes-Benz S-class, can almost without any driver's participation move around the freeways, and relatively affordable hatchbacks have the option of automatic parking. <br><br>  A robotic version of the Audi TT took part in the high-speed climb to Pikes Peak Hill, while the BMW with autopilot <a href="http://www.drive.ru/news/bmw/52ce988194a6567e4500001e.html">shows the wonders of drift</a> .  The scale of development of autonomous robot vehicles is also indicated by the fact that for many years there have been competitions of robot cars in the world, for example, in the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARPA_Grand_Challenge">USA</a> and <a href="http://www.russianrobotics.ru/actions/actions_73.html">Russia</a> . <br><br>  Just the other day we joined this movement.  In the framework of the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Nokia, represented by the cartographic and geotagging platform, announced its cooperation with one of the largest manufacturers of automotive technologies and components, Continental.  As part of this partnership, it is planned to develop a car information platform, called ‚ÄúElectronic Horizon‚Äù (eHorizon), for cars and trucks of various manufacturers. <br><br>  The development teams participating in the project say that Horizon will be the first step towards the implementation of global projects of autonomous vehicles and intelligent transport systems. <br><br>  So what is the "Electronic Horizon"? <br><br>  Imagine a car that can determine its location on the road every 10‚Äì20 centimeters of a journey and automatically reacts to rapid and sudden changes in the external environment, such as speed limits, prohibiting signs and sudden overlaps of lanes.  Based on the plans of the project developers, this should become a reality in the near future and will radically change the principles of personal transport management. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5b7/3c9/9c2/5b73c99c2cf16f7f41c53746c01b7995.jpg"><br><br>  Of course, the main feature of the eHorizon project will be the opportunity for drivers to choose at what point to provide control of the car itself, while focusing on other things.  And in case the driver drives the car himself, the system will protect him, allowing the car to react in dangerous situations faster than the person behind the wheel can do. <br><br>  At the heart of the eHorizon system is a control module that calculates the location of the vehicle through information from HERE, GPS, gyroscope and other vehicle sensors. <br><br>  Nokia's HERE platform seems to be the ideal solution for eHorizon, in that it provides highly accurate and up-to-date 3D maps and cloud services with instant information about the changing traffic situation that is necessary for the operation of such a system.  To create our maps, we use modern mapping tools such as LiDAR technology, as well as serious analytical data. <br><br>  By collecting information, the module recreates a virtual copy of the road, taking into account all traffic information, including information on marking, speed limits, prohibition signs and other details related to the geometry of the road.  After that, all information is transmitted to the government and other services of the ‚Äúsmart‚Äù car, allowing it to make decisions based on this model. <br><br>  Another obvious at first glance, but no less important advantage of the project "Electronic Horizon" is concern for the environment.  Suppose that most cars in the near future will have a hybrid drive type.  Being connected to the "Horizon", "smart" hybrid car will be able to most effectively manage electric motors, connecting the internal combustion engine, depending on the traffic situation and the terrain.  According to preliminary calculations, the average rate of CO2 emissions from this type of car can be reduced by at least 2 g / km.  In addition, the system prompts the user to select alternative, more ‚Äúeconomical‚Äù or rational routes if there is a traffic jam on the way, as well as help to adjust the LED beam of the headlights, depending on the type of road and the environment. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/be4/d35/e05/be4d35e057be53febfc4d33d88816307.jpg"><br><br>  So far, the eHorizon project is only under development, but the project participants at HERE and ontinental are sure that Highly Automated Driving will definitely become part of everyday life and this should happen no later than 2020.  And this is just one element of the structure of Intelligent Transportations Systems, the creation of which we are working with Continental. <br><br>  No one will argue that the evolution of road transport is moving by leaps and bounds: from automated parallel parking, we are already gradually coming to intelligent driving (‚Äúsmart‚Äù cruise control, control technology by wire), and then to fully autonomous driving.  How do you see individual transport in 10‚Äì15 years?  Will cars dream about electric sheep? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/209998/">https://habr.com/ru/post/209998/</a></p>
