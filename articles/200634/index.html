    <h1>  Emergency service </h1><br>  The main task and the unique function of the Service is to give a person who is in danger of a criminal nature an opportunity to instantly attract the attention of others by sending an SOS signal.  Such an opportunity will naturally increase safety because: <br><ol><li>  The number of witnesses to any incident will increase dramatically.  Increased crime detection.  Crime will decrease. </li><li>  Potential criminals will quickly realize that it has become much more difficult to commit a crime and go unnoticed.  They are aware of the increased risks.  This will reduce crime. </li><li>  In many cases, each of us will be able to avoid the harsh effects of an attack simply because the perpetrator, seeing the people who have appeared nearby, will stop the criminal activities and try to escape. </li><li>  People will start helping each other in emergency situations, and this will change their attitude towards each other and will begin to change the very atmosphere in society from fear to trust. </li></ol><br>  I would like to once again draw your attention to these four points.  They are very simple, but fundamental.  It is these mechanisms that represent the core of the Service, on which all additional functionality will be strung. <br><br>  It is obvious that the SOS signal sent by a person should get not only to others, but also to special services (police, Emergency Situations Ministry, ambulance, etc.) and, if desired, a person, his relatives.  All this should happen immediately, because the second signal, not to mention phone calls, may simply not be enough time. <br><br><br><h1>  The service will make the police work </h1><br>  and, in doing so, will be of great assistance to the police  This sounds <strike>absurdly</strike> somewhat strange, but that is exactly what will happen.  To understand why, let's look at the technical implementation of the Service. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5c5/f85/8f6/5c5f858f6656b08fd93d2adcb1da6344.jpg"></div><br><br>  The user installs the ‚ÄúPanic Button‚Äù program on his smartphone or tablet or uses a separate key fob with the corresponding button.  When you press a panic button, an SOS message is sent to all surrounding and special services with a photo and information about who pressed the panic button, as well as its current coordinate.  The user becomes visible to others only when you press the alarm button.  SOS message is the beginning of group chat.  Then others will be able to take pictures or shoot an incident on the camera, while all the information will automatically fall into this group chat and will be instantly accessible to everyone.  In addition, the system will be able to automatically track on-line further movement of all people caught in the incident area and post messages in the chat, for example, of the following nature: ‚Äú10 people received a help signal, 5 of them are already going to help.‚Äù  Through the same channel, law enforcement agencies will be able to quickly coordinate the actions of all the witnesses who are close to the incident.  The smartphone itself, on which the alarm button was pressed, can turn on the listening and broadcasting mode of audio and video to the common air. <br><br>  This group chat, in addition to the interaction tool at the time of the incident, will in fact become the documented chronology of the incident.  He will help to find the guilty and not leave the heroes in the shadow of attention. <br><br>  Investigators will be able to quickly receive photos of criminals, find witnesses and uncover more crimes ‚Äúhot on the heels‚Äù.  The police will be forced to use the Service, since they simply do not have tools comparable in effectiveness.  And as soon as this starts to happen, you will have to start reacting to incoming calls, and, over time, bring the necessary legislative base under it. <br><br><h3>  How the police will cope with a shaft of calls if does not cope now? </h3><br>  And this question has the answer.  In the future, six months - a year, street crime will significantly decrease, and there will be less work.  But, in addition, the police immediately receive help.  On this and how the Service will earn money for support and development - on. <br><br>  The service will be absolutely free for users.  However, if you wish, for a small monthly fee you can further improve your own safety (and the safety of your loved ones).  In this case, the closest crews of private security companies that have entered into agreements with the Service will receive a signal for help.  The nearest crew will MUST arrive at the scene of an accident within a regulated period of 2-5 minutes and assist.  Thus, in fact, each of us will be able to get personal bodyguards. <br><br>  The subscription fee according to preliminary estimates may be so insignificant that this service will be in great demand.  This will greatly relieve the police. <br><br><br><h1>  Additional features </h1><br>  The service can provide many related features.  Here are some of them. <br><br>  Search for witnesses of an accident.  The service will provide an opportunity to send a message asking to respond to anyone who was near the accident site at a certain time.  The message can be sent not only immediately after the accident, but at any time later. <br><br>  The panic button can be used not only in case of danger of a criminal nature, but also, for example, if the person became ill.  In this case, everyone around them will receive instructions on their smartphones along with a request for help, how to help this particular patient. <br><br>  In the event of an emergency, the Ministry of Emergency Situations will be able to instantly localize the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe incident and effectively coordinate the actions of all who fall into this area. <br><br><br><h1>  Service Implementation </h1><br>  To date, there is not only the concept of the Service, but also the existing prototypes.  There is a lot of work ahead and a lot of difficulties to overcome, for example, with handling false calls.  But all these difficulties fade against the background of the significance of the results that can be achieved. <br><br>  I am sure that Habr today has tremendous power and, if our community speaks "FOR", the Service will work within a few months.  I urge everyone to be active and express their opinions, and I will keep you updated on the news. <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/200634/">https://habr.com/ru/post/200634/</a></p>
