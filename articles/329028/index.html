  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Kotlin for Android: Now officially</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Yesterday, at the Google I / O 2017 conference, the Android team <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2017/05/android-announces-support-for-kotlin.html">announced</a> the official support of the <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/">Kotlin</a> language for developing Android applications.  This is a huge step forward for Kotlin, and great news for the entire community of Android developers. <br><br>  Kotlin gives Android developers the ability to use powerful modern language, the code for which is more compact and reliable, reducing the likelihood of users to drop applications.  Kotlin is easy to learn and combines perfectly with Java, which allows you to gradually introduce it into existing projects without losing your accumulated experience, skills and technologies. <br><br>  The plugin for Kotlin support is now included with Android Studio 3.0, so developers don't need to install additional plugins or worry about compatibility.  JetBrains and Google are also committed to supporting development at Kotlin in the future as the Android platform evolves.

      At the same time, other platforms that support Kotlin (Kotlin / JVM for developing server and desktop applications, Kotlin / JS for the browser and Kotlin / Nativte for native development) are equally important for JetBrains.  Our vision is to create a single tool that allows you to develop all the components of a modern application in the same language, regardless of the platform on which these components are launched.  This includes full-stack web applications, and mobile clients for Android and iOS, and embedded IoT platforms, and more. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  As with human languages, it is very useful for a programming language to be popular.  Official support from Android will lead to an increase in the number of programmers at Kotlin, which means that Kotlin will develop more libraries and tools, more educational materials, it will be easier to find solutions for possible problems or get a job as a programmer at Kotlin.  We are very excited about the new perspectives that this opens up for the Kotlin ecosystem! <br><br>  We decided to create a non-profit partnership with Google around Kotlin.  At the same time, the development of the language will continue to be done by JetBrains, and the Kotlin team (currently more than 40 people) will work as before.  Andrei Breslav remains the leading designer of the language, and the principles that guide us in the development do not change.  Our design will still be open, because we need feedback from the community in order to develop Kotlin in the right direction. <br><br>  On May 19, 2017 at 20:30 Moscow time, you will be able to watch a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DlH5aywLo-Ic">live broadcast of the</a> report from Google I / O about Kotlin, which will be done by Andrey Breslav and Hadi Hariri, the leading evangelist of JetBrains.  And in November, Kotlin will host <a href="https://kotlinconf.com/">its own conference</a> , which will be held in the city of San Francisco. <br><br><h2>  Thank you so much! </h2><br>  When Kotlin began its way more than 6 years ago, we set a goal to create a language oriented towards the same principles as our other tools - to help developers with the routine part of their work, allowing them to focus on what is really important.  Programming should be enjoyable and fun! <br><br>  We are extremely grateful to Google and the Android team for the trust they have placed in us, but above all, we are grateful to you - our community, our users.  Without you, Kotlin could not have achieved what he has achieved today.  Thank you for being with us on this path, and we hope to see you with us in the future. <br><br><h2>  FAQ </h2><br>  We have prepared answers to some questions that you may have in connection with this announcement.  If your question is not listed, we will be happy to answer it in the comments.  If you are not very familiar with Kotlin, you can find key information in the <a href="http://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/faq.html">FAQ on our website</a> . <br><br><h3>  Will Kotlin focus primarily on Android? </h3><br>  One of the main goals of Kotlin, both now and in the future, is to support various platforms.  We continue to develop Kotlin / JVM (for server, desktop and other applications for the Java platform) and Kotlin / JS.  For other platforms, such as macOS, iOS and embedded / IoT systems, we are working on Kotlin / Native. <br><br><h3>  How will this affect the Kotlin release cycle? </h3><br>  As before, Kotlin will have its release cycle, not tied to releases of Android or Android Studio.  Projects remain completely independent.  Of course, we will work closely with developers from Google to ensure that Kotlin always remains compatible with Android Studio and other Android development tools. <br><br><h3>  Who will develop the plugin for Android Studio? </h3><br>  As before, JetBrains will be responsible for developing a plugin for Android Studio.  We plan to work closely with the team of Android Studio. <br><br><h3>  Will this affect Kotlin support in IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse or NetBeans? </h3><br>  Not.  Kotlin is a multi-platform language, and we will invest in supporting various IDEs just as before.  Our main efforts are focused on the plugin for IntelliJ IDEA, and we will be happy to help the community to work on plug-ins under Eclipse and NetBeans. <br><br><h3>  Will this affect macOS and iOS support? </h3><br>  Not.  We plan to support both of these platforms in Kotlin / Native, and this plan does not change at all. <br><br><h3>  Is Google going to buy JetBrains? </h3><br>  Not.  JetBrains does not plan to sell to any other company.  We have been and remain an independent tool maker for all developers, no matter what language and platform they are programming. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/329028/">https://habr.com/ru/post/329028/</a></p>
