In a broad sense, the tasks of marketing are to identify and satisfy human and social needs. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Classics of marketing: there - advertising, from there: focus groups and polls </h2><br>  Until recently, communication with consumers was, in fact, unidirectional: there was advertising, from there: focus groups and polls.  Feedback tools had a tremendous error, since they did not correspond to the volumes of the target audience (very small samples) and were subjective (often the performers did beautiful research, rather than objective ones). <br><br>  Marketing was built on the model: Product Creation ‚Üí Convincing the buyer of his usefulness and the need to acquire it.  Main channel: Advertising, Methods: information load, mass presence.  Won the one who created a more massive and broadcast information flow, or spent huge funds on research, that is, provided the work of feedback.  For the majority, such work is a lottery, because in advertising it is impossible to say to everyone and everything ‚Äî you need to guess the target audience and the product characteristic that you need to convey to this audience.  If there is a hit, the advertisement will work; if not, the money will be wasted.

      This model no longer works, primarily due to the glut of all information channels with advertising, as a result of which the consumer has developed immunity to many types of advertising and filters it in its information flow, advertising has turned from useful information into background. <br><br><h2>  Communication marketing </h2><br>  Due to the fact that today, through social networks, we have direct access to information flows in which our consumers ‚Äúlive‚Äù, we can study these flows, reliably analyzing the needs of consumers, we can enter into a dialogue with them, not cram them goods and services, as advertising does, do not burden them with unnecessary information, but by communicating with them and thus figuring out their needs and returning them in the form of the required product properties.  Today, in our information exchange with the consumer, we easily endow the product with the properties that NOW they need.  We, in fact, massively carry out individual sales, adapting to the consumer and not burdening him with unnecessary information.  This is a different approach, completely different - Communication marketing. <br><br>  In practice, Communication Marketing is the formation and implementation of ideology and communication policy, based on the properties of what we offer to our consumers and on the image of the company that ‚Äúideally fits‚Äù to our product and its consumer.  This is done with the constant adjustment of the information flow through continuous feedback from consumers.  To follow us, our customer must be 100% sure that he is heard, understood and offered NOW to him exactly what he needs, what he expects. <br><br>  The ad here starts to play a background task, like a dancer.  And the goal of all this is sales.  Because the market today is not in stores and not on advertising posters, but in smartphones. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/315948/">https://habr.com/ru/post/315948/</a></p>
