  <section class="page js-page"><h1>New version of the free product Veeam Backup & Replication 6.5 Free Edition</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A new version of <b>Veeam Backup &amp; Replication 6.5 <i>for VMware and Hyper-V has been released</i></b> .  <b>The version contains more than 50 improvements, most of which are included in the free version of the product</b> .  The most interesting and important among them: <br><ul><li>  E-Discovery and Granular Recovery of Exchange Server Objects </li><li>  Recover from HP SAN Disk Snapshots </li><li>  Support for vSphere 5.1 and Windows Server 2012 Hyper-V </li><li>  Ensuring the correctness of IP packet connections when transferring backups via WAN </li></ul><br>  Consider them in more detail: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  E-Discovery and Granular Recovery of Exchange Server Objects </h5><br>  Version 6.5 contains the new tool, <b>Veeam Explorer <i>for Microsoft Exchange</i></b> , which allows virtual environment administrators to restore individual letters and other Exchange objects of the server upon request of employees from the Exchange information base of the server, without having to perform a full recovery of the Exchange server and dependent virtual machines from the backup.  The functionality of this tool can be viewed <a href="http://www.veeam.com/microsoft-exchange-recovery.html%3Fad%3Dhabr">here (in English)</a> or <a href="http://ashirmanov.blogspot.com/2012/08/veeam-explorer-for-microsoft-exchange.html">here</a> , and its differences from the granular recovery of Exchange server objects through the universal recovery technology U-AIR are <a href="http://ashirmanov.blogspot.com/2012/10/Item-Level-Application-Recovery.html">here</a> .  The only limitation of the free version is the inability to directly restore the letter to the original mailbox (features such as recovering a single letter to the msg file (Outlook format) and typing letters to the PST file are available). <br><br><h5>  Recover from SAN disk images </h5><br>  Version 6.5 contains HP's <b>Veeam Explorer <i>for SAN Snapshots</i></b> tool developed in conjunction with HP, which allows you to perform granular recovery of information from disk snapshots of <b>HP StoreVirtual VSA</b> and <b>HP LeftHand NAS</b> .  The functionality of this tool can be viewed <a href="http://go.veeam.com/san-snapshot-explorer.html%3Fad%3Dhabr">here (in English)</a> or <a href="http://ashirmanov.blogspot.com/2012/08/veeam-explorer-for-san-snapshots-hp-san.html">here</a> .  For recovery, options such as instant recovery of virtual machines, instantaneous granular file recovery, and granular recovery of Exchange server objects (Veeam Explorer for Exchange, described above) are available. <br><br>  It should be recalled here that, although SAN snapshots provide the best RPO, they have two significant drawbacks: <br>  (1) Snapshots are stored on the same disk / device, which means that in the event of a failure, both the original information and all its backup copies can be lost. <br>  (2) in general, the technology of hardware snapshots does not allow application-aware backups to be created (that is, their consistency corresponds to the level of a computer power down without first resetting the application buffers in memory to disk).

      To avoid the above risks, you should use <b>VeeamZIP</b> or full-scale scheduled backup to a separate backup repository. <br><br><h5>  VSphere 5.1 support </h5><br>  Version 6.5 fully supports <b>vSphere 5.1</b> as a virtualization environment and <b>Windows Server 2012</b> as a guest operating system. <br><br><h5>  Supports Windows Server 2012 Hyper-V </h5><br>  Version 6.5 fully supports <b>Windows Server 2012 Hyper-V</b> as a virtualization environment, including VHDX format disks and virtual disks up to 64TB in size. <br><br>  In addition to the main backup and replication scenario, Veeam Backup and Replication or VeeamZIP can help virtual environment administrators in implementing migration projects or in-place updates to Windows Server 2012 Hyper-V with Windows Server 2008 R2 Hyper-V, since Veeam products support both versions of this virtualization system, and allow you to back up virtual machines with Windows Server 2008 R2 and then restore to Windows Server 2012. <br><br>  In the paid version of the product another key feature is available: <br><h5>  Operational monitoring and resource planning for backup tasks </h5><br>  Starting with version 6.5, Veeam ONE and Veeam Backup and Replication are tightly integrated, available as part of Veeam Management Suite, and provide the following new key features: <br><ul><li>  Backup Infrastructure Real-Time Monitoring </li><li>  Detection of unprotected virtual machines (that is, not included in any backup task) </li><li>  Analysis and scheduling of resources (for example, available disk space in the backup repository) </li></ul><br><h5>  And more than 50 other improvements and enhancements. </h5><br>  A description of all improvements is outside the scope of this article;  it is available in the <a href="http://www.veeam.com/veeam_backup_6_5_whats_new_en_wn.pdf%3Fad%3Dhabr">What's New in 6.5</a> document on the product page.  However, one of them should pay special attention: <br><br><h5>  Ensuring the correctness of IP packet connections when transferring backups via WAN </h5><br>  The corruption of these IP packets is mainly due to hardware errors.  And the longer the network route, the more likely it is that the data will be distorted during transmission.  In theory, the checksum field in the TCP packet should help with this problem.  However, the correctness of the interpretation of this field is still at the discretion of a specific hardware and driver manufacturer.  In practice, we faced a problem when some network cards (even from well-known manufacturers) send an IP packet with an incorrect checksum further along the network stack to the operating system, as if the packet was correct, instead of discarding such a packet as erroneous! <br><br>  This problem becomes especially relevant when transferring large amounts of data over a WAN (for example, when transferring backups between different offices over the Internet).  As a result, you can get distorted backups that will be considered correct, but from which you can not restore anything at the right moment. <br><br>  Therefore, we decided to add functionality to correctly check IP packets to Veeam Backup and Replication 6.5 (in case of detecting erroneous checksums of packets, the packets are rejected and automatically re-requested from the sender again).  This ensures that the data transferred is absolutely equivalent to the data received. <br><br>  PS Full description of the free product and features of the new version is available <a href="http://www.veeam.com/ru/virtual-machine-backup-solution-free/resources.html%3Fad%3Dhabr">here</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/156561/">https://habr.com/ru/post/156561/</a></p>
