  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Anton Antich: ‚ÄúWe will offer advertisers new mechanisms‚Äù</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  After less than half a year of its existence, the rating of the Runet blogs began to turn into a universal project about the Russian blogosphere, acquired a separate site and changed its name to <a href="http://blogus.ru/">Blogus</a> . <br><br>  Testing "Blogus" has not yet been completed.  New features appear almost every day.  For example, the <a href="http://blogus.ru/add/">addition of new blogs</a> was reopened yesterday.  In one day, a hundred blogs were added, and their total base exceeded 1,200. <br><br>  Today Blogus undoubtedly provides the most objective picture of the Russian blogosphere.  When calculating the rating of each blog, statistics from Yandex and Technorati are taken into account, and spam links are also filtered.  The founder of ‚ÄúBlogus‚Äù Anton Antich is actively working on the project and regularly talks about it in <a href="http://sundaybytes.com/category/blogus/">his blog</a> .  We asked Anton to explain in which direction his brainchild was developing.

    <a name="habracut"></a>  <b>In February, your project was born as a rating of Russian-language blogs.</b>  <b>What is Blogus today?</b> <br><br>  Today, a part of the ‚ÄúBlogus‚Äù visible to the general public is, by and large, still a rating of Russian-language blogs. <br>  At the same time in the development and testing is now a lot of features that go beyond the rating.  We slowly lay out the preview of these services in order to improve them based on feedback. <br><br>  This is, first of all, the construction and indexing of the base of blog posts available in the rating.  And with this information you can solve the main stated goal of the project: to find and filter really useful and interesting content of different thematic focus.  The very first steps in this direction have already been taken - this is the ability to categorize blogs using tags, as well as search prototypes for tags inside posts.  Naturally, all this will develop. <br><br>  <b>Have you managed to realize much of what was originally intended?</b> <br><br>  As you rightly noted, the project appeared in February as a rating of Russian-language blogs.  Those who read my blog are familiar with the story of his birth: I was on a business trip to South Africa, and since it‚Äôs not safe to go out there in the evenings, having nothing to do with the old memory in one evening I wrote to Microsoft Visual Studio Express rating based on data and API Technorati.  What I mean is that initially nothing like this was originally intended.  But already after a week after the launch, the rating was visited by about 20,000 people, I wondered what to do with this further. <br><br>  If we talk about current plans, then, of course, the project is very far from completion, moreover - they are constantly being adjusted as new functions are launched and tested. <br><br>  <b>Who is involved in the work on this project, except you?</b> <br><br>  At various times directly in the work on the project took from one to three people, as designers and programmers.  Further transition to the next level is quite possible, and then we, most likely, will begin to hire people, so watch the announcements. <br><br>  <b>Probably most of the feedback from the bloggers themselves is extremely positive.</b>  <b>But are there any negative reviews?</b>  <b>What are they connected with?</b> <br><br>  There are all kinds of reviews.  Negatives are mainly due to the inability to add or change data about a blog that is already in the ranking.  Unfortunately, there are too few of us to manually satisfy all requests, so we are trying to quickly launch a functional that will allow all these actions to be performed independently.  It is already possible to add, starting from today, and it will be possible to change the data after starting the registration. <br><br>  <b>What prospects do you see for Blogus?</b>  <b>Can this project become something serious?</b>  <b>How do you think he can be influential and authoritative?</b> <br><br>  Of course it can.  It all depends on two factors - the completeness of the database and the originality of the services, how we can perform the main task - filtering the most interesting content, and by any request.  Promotion, etc.  - this is a matter of equipment and investments, which is solved quite easily in current conditions. <br><br>  <b>Can Blogus make a profit?</b>  <b>Due to what?</b> <br><br>  My firm conviction about content projects, based in general on many years of world experience, is that they can only bring profit through advertising.  "Blogus" is no exception.  Another thing is that the Russian market is very underdeveloped even in comparison with the existing funds in the west.  If everything goes according to plan, we will eventually try to offer advertisers new mechanisms with greater efficiency. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4214/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4214/</a></p>
