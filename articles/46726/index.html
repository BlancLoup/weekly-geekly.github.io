  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Conclusion webmoney in Ukraine</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In my work I use several payment methods.  Most often it is webmoney - simple, convenient, reliable.  I see the business level of the customer, the customer is mine.  There are many useful functions and arbitration - in which you can‚Äôt prove anything to anyone, but you can block the offender‚Äôs wallet (I had that experience). <br><br>  But money in an electronic wallet is not the same as money in a real wallet.  This post is dedicated to how to output webmoney in Ukraine. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  On the webmoney site you can list all possible withdrawal methods: <br><br>  1. Exchange for cash in one of the certified exchange points. <br>  2. Exchange for Russian rubles with subsequent postal order. <br>  3. Exchange for electronic currency of other payment systems. <br>  4. Transfer to your specified bank account. <br>  5. Translate through the CONTACT system (Russia), Aval-Express and SOFT (Ukraine). <br>  6. Transfer to a bank card obtained through the service Payment cards + WebMoney.

      <u>The 2nd method</u> works only for WMR - for Ukraine it is not relevant. <br>  <u>The third way</u> doesn‚Äôt interest us either - we need cash. <br>  <u>The 4th method</u> is available with a withdrawal of at least 10,000 USD.  If the amount is less, then the system offers to use the services of a kind of auction on <a href="https://wire.exchanger.ru/">wire.exchanger.ru</a> .  I never managed to change anything there, perhaps I didn‚Äôt try very hard ... <br>  <b>UPD.</b>  Here people say that it makes sense to use this service. <br><br>  Now more about what's left. <br><br><h4>  Exchange for cash in one of the certified exchange points </h4><br>  I changed.  Damn, I have been changing it this way for two years ... This is probably the most inconvenient and unprofitable way.  It is justified only when you really need to exchange WMZ for USD.  Among its shortcomings: <br><ul><li>  High commission of exchange points - from 1.5% to 5%.  In this case, in some exchangers, the percentage depends on the amount (the more money you withdraw, the less the commission will be), while in others it does not. </li><li>  Undervalued dollar exchange rate in exchange for UAH.  Here is a real example.  At one Lviv cantor (the cantor of the Beavers brothers :)) WMZ was bought at the rate of 5.5 UAH / WMZ, and sold at 7 UAH / WMZ.  In currency exchange offices, the dollar buying rate was around 6.5 UAH / USD.  Cool? </li><li>  Not reliable.  Constantly there is a risk that you will be divorced.  One guy, who took 2.5% for the exchange and from whom <a href="http://dovhyj.com/">Igor Reiter</a> and I took the money several times, once gave me a fake 100 UAH.  I did not understand intentionally or accidentally - I just stopped working with him.  In addition, contact with him was problematic. </li><li>  Not stable.  Recently, I began to face the fact that there is a lot of WMZ in exchange offices and vice versa - very little cash.  Those.  they stupidly do not buy anything - they only sell.  So I waited for three weeks to change money at one of the previously checked points. </li></ul><br><br>  We consider.  The minimum commission of the exchange office is 1.5% (surely you will find such a hell by the way) + commission webmoney 0.8% = <b>2.3%</b> . <br><br><h4>  Transfer through Aval-Express and SOFT (Ukraine) </h4><br>  I use this method now.  The only inconvenience is changing only WMU and only for UAH.  And since the USD rate is now unstable and mostly growing, I only change the WMZ when I really need cash. <br>  You can change WMZ to WMU directly in the program itself (I once did not know and changed through ROBOX).  The course is more or less decent.  For example, when in Privat the purchase rate was 7.0 UAH / USD, and in other banks 7.1 - 7.2 UAH / USD, then webmoney rate was 7.23 WMU / WMZ.  The disadvantage of this gimp - you have to pay an additional 0.8% webmoney. <br><br>  Now on systems: <br><ul><li>  <a href="https://banking.ukrgarant.com/%3Fmode%3Dperevod_soft">SOFT</a> for some reason did not work when I changed.  His commission is lower and is only 1%. </li><li>  <a href="https://banking.ukrgarant.com/%3Fmode%3Dperevod_aval">Aval-Express</a> works - commission 1.5%.  After submitting the application you receive an invoice that is desirable to pay.  Two days later, you can take a passport and walk to the nearest Raifazen office for money. </li></ul><br>  We consider.  0.8% webmoney commission when exchanging WMZ for WMU + 0.8% one more webmoney commission + 1.0% SOFT or 1.5% Aval-Express = <b>2.6% -3.1%</b> . <br>  A bit more than in the previous version, but much easier, faster and more reliable. <br><br><h4>  Transfer to a bank card </h4><br>  You can choose from several types of maps.  I will talk about Payoneer, because I know for sure that they work in Ukraine. <br><br>  <a href="http://cards.webmoney.ru/asp/wmpayoneertarif.asp">Here</a> you can see the tariffs of the system when working with Webmoney Payoneer.  As you can see, a lot depends on the certificate.  So for the Initial Passport, the commission for the accrual of funds is 1.5%, and for the Personal Passport - 0.5%.  Also, the limits on the card replenishment are also different.  I think in this case obtaining a Personal Passport will be a justified action. <br><br>  We consider.  0.8% commission webmoney + 0.5% Payoneer + 1% for cash withdrawals = <b>2.3%</b> . <br>  As you can see, the total commission is the same as the minimum commission for withdrawing funds through the exchange office.  But: <br><ul><li>  No hemorrhoids with the search for the exchanger, which is ready to change money.  Independence yopt! </li><li>  No risk. </li><li>  The USD cards come on the card, which can be changed at any time to UAH at any ATM or bank. </li><li>  The card can be used for payments over the Internet and abroad. </li></ul><br>  It seems to me that the advantages of this withdrawal method are obvious. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/46726/">https://habr.com/ru/post/46726/</a></p>
