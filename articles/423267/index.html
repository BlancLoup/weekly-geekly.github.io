Part 1</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wz/r7/hn/wzr7hn8ukrxisgoxflr1hpemxis.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Or a vacuum cleaner controlled by Bluetooth </h4><br>  In the process of technical creativity, not only all sorts of useful things are obtained, but also many different shavings, sawdust and other debris.  And this garbage should be removed both in the process of sawing and after.  Below I will tell about my solution to this problem, and in one, I will show a remote control project for devices with a phase-pulse controller. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  To begin with, I chose a vacuum cleaner suitable for cleaning chips, including metal.  Vacuum cleaners with a bag disappeared immediately.  Because paper shavings and other pieces of iron will quickly tear a paper bag, and you will not shake it all out of a fabric bag.  The choice fell on a vacuum cleaner with a cyclone filter (container) and a foam filter after it.  It's comfortable.  You just spill the shavings out of the glass and wash the foam sometimes.  With him, I implemented a chip suction on a manual mill directly from under the cutter during operation.  This greatly improves visibility, reduces chip spread and improves quality, because chips do not interfere with the process and the cutter does not get stuck in it.  The control of the vacuum cleaner was through an outlet with a relay synchronized with the inclusion of the machine. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1n/-k/sl/1n-ksln8jpqtamgkdloehkkgyzk.jpeg"></a> <br>  <i>Clickable</i>

      But then this was not enough.  And I made a big cyclone with a 20 liters tank. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_z/oy/6_/_zoy6_bodsum6ntksqht0sbu_xi.jpeg"></a> <br>  <i>Clickable</i> <br><br><h4>  Here is a cool thing! </h4><br><ol><li>  This is the cyclone itself.  It creates a whirlwind of air and dust / dirt is thrown by centrifugal force into the tank 2 </li><li>  The tank must be absolutely tight and have strong walls so that it will not be crushed by depression.  It must have a removable cover to shake out the garbage. </li><li>  The basis on rollers that was convenient to roll on a workshop to different machines or when cleaning. </li></ol><br>  The vacuum cleaner serves as a source of suction power for the cyclone.  Now any.  Because the cyclone catches 99% of the garbage and the vacuum cleaner needs to be cleaned very rarely.  A cyclone does not cope well with fine dust, which has almost no mass (for example, concrete dust), but this is not our case.  I am not a builder.  But the sawdust after the electric jigsaw is already within his power, and the metal shavings - by itself. <br><br>  Cyclone itself (1) I bought in a Chinese online store. <br><br>  <s>I stole a</s> barrel of toxic glue <s>from a warehouse. Soyuzmultfilm together with a purple horse and a green snosmurik were</s> presented from a familiar company. <br>  The stand on the rollers bummed himself. <br><br>  It seems all great, but there was a problem.  If you look closely at the photo, <s>you can see the ancient carpet of the 16th century,</s> it is clear that the controls of the vacuum cleaner remained on the handle, which is stuck at the exit of the cyclone.  And the hose with which you wield it is not connected to the vacuum cleaner and does not control it.  It is inconvenient however!  So what to do?  Pull the wires it will be terribly inconvenient in them you get confused, you fall and break all that is possible and impossible. <br><br><h4>  We need to come up with a radio control! </h4><br>  Fortunately, I still have a handle from an old torn hose.  By the way, this is also an idea for hose repair with control.  Hose can be put any, and the control to make the radio.  The main thing is to keep a pen with a button. <br><br>  I also have an idea to integrate radio modules into machines where I apply chip suction (CNC milling cutter and conventional) and integrate suction control into the machine panel.  And in the case of CNC, it will be possible to set the suction programmatically from the G code.  And do not poke at the outlet with the relay. <br><br><h4>  No sooner said than done.  Consider the scheme of my Samsung vacuum cleaner: </h4><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wj/q9/oz/wjq9ozkrisnrvfmcbvqkyhthbhu.jpeg"></a> <br>  <i>Clickable</i> <br><br><h4>  What do we see here? </h4><br>  The manufacturer did not apply for a 220 volt handle so that the user would not be killed by the current, and made a transformer and a galvanic isolation.  It's nice when they take care of you.  And from the low-voltage part, you can take power for the "brains".  The motor is controlled through a triac and he opens the optocoupler.  The red zener diode circuit painters just forgot :) <br>  In the scheme I would like to file so as not to tear down the native functionality.  Let the vacuum cleaner be able to work as a regular household. <br><br><h4>  Draw conclusions: </h4><br><ol><li>  You have to do PWM control and synchronize it with the network.  Just changing the voltage or something like that will not work. </li><li>  Since the control of the triac, we will have to wake up starting from the end of the half-cycle of the mains voltage so that the triac closes when going through 0 and opens when we need it. </li><li>  We need a protective interval in order to have time to remove the illumination of the optocouplers before the transition through 0, again, so that the triac closes and does not open at the beginning of the next half period. </li><li>  It is necessary that the motor is guaranteed to start and the brushes are not burnt.  You can not start the PWM with zero duty cycle.  Because the motor must overcome friction and is guaranteed to startonut.  Need a minimum duty cycle and it must be measured. </li><li>  To power the "brain" will have to use a pulse down converter.  Power "brains" 3.3V and 30V at the output of the transformer.  To dissipate so much into heat is not humane, especially since the trance is small and will be heated. </li></ol><br><h4>  I decided to ‚Äúcrash‚Äù into the circuit in the following way: </h4><br>  From point 1 we take food.  But through the diode!  Because pulsed voltage is necessary for the operation of the native circuit. <br>  From point 2 we will remove the synchronization pulse with the network. <br>  In point 3, we connect another transistor, which will open the optocoupler with a signal from the controller. <br>  Well, the earth 4 also does not hurt us. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lv/ef/nu/lvefnul6aevpdz9y-fjcgen39g4.jpeg"></a> <br>  <i>Clickable</i> <br><br>  By the method of scientific tying an oscilloscope into a working board, I measured that the minimum duty cycle for a confident start of the motor should be 20%.  And I decided to make a guard interval before going through 0, to make 5% of the network half-period, that is, 0.5 miles.  You will need to program the controller to do something like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wq/mf/6r/wqmf6roi3zb9kleumvwsrck78yo.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  For radio connection, I ordered such cheap SPP Bluetooth modules in China: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dk/2n/jy/dk2njya93e-lqjv4br8fpql9ise.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Their name is HC-05 </h4><br>  They can be configured as a receiver and transmitter.  They are configured by UART AT commands.  The process is much where described.  I think you should not dwell on it and there is a datasheet on these modules on the network. <br><br>  I did not set the receiver with a standard PIN to protect against third-party connections, but the transmitter locked the receiver to a fixed address so that it did not connect with anything.  In general, he protected the device from vicious connections :) <br><br>  The speed chose 9600 is more than enough.  It would be enough for this brain Megi8.  Turned on the modules, checked.  They connect themselves without additional commands and the terminal checked that the letters from one module to another arrive.  Marked, who of them who postponed until the rest of the giblets are ready. <br><br>  Everything, I'm tired of writing and nobody will read long articles. <br>  It's Friday!  And it's time to start celebrating it, and I wish it to everyone! <br><br>  In the next part, I will show the hardcore implementation of the receiver and transmitter, tell you how I saw the boards on the router. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/423267/">https://habr.com/ru/post/423267/</a></p>
