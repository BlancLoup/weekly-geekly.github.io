  <section class="page js-page"><h1>CCTV on OS X</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Living in the taiga among squirrels and snakes, I thought about the safety of the micro-settlement where I like to rest so much.  I decided to start with the organization of video surveillance with any simple analytics and notification system.  Since the project is budgetary and the crisis in the country decided to use the iMac 27 "2010 + 4x Hikvision HiWatch DS-N201 + Yota server. <br><br>  Video surveillance was organized without difficulty, since Hikvision HiWatch DS-n201 is perfectly made cameras, each such camera can work independently only needs storage, but for centralization you need a server and for a software (CCTV) server.  Hikvision iVMS 4200 for Mac OS X could not satisfy my requirements as it is just a client.  I turned my attention to other systems - not tied to the manufacturer, I managed to find 3 pieces worthy of the attention of the systems: <br>  1. <a href="http://felenasoft.com/ru/">Xeoma</a> <br>  2. <a href="http://www.bensoftware.com/securityspy/">SecuritySpy</a> <br>  3. EvoCam; <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The rest of the systems are beautiful and amazing, but under Windows.  Install and use only the first two systems.  I must say that I stopped at Xeoma because: <br>  1. Price (Xeoma for 8 pieces - 6000 rubles., SecuritySpy - 212 euros); <br>  2. When detecting scenes, Xeoma is able to isolate objects that have disturbed it, whereas SecuritySpy does not mean this; <br>  3. Russian language; <br>  4. An interesting approach to design, implementation and visualization - the interface gives the impression that you are ‚Äúnatively‚Äù throwing in modules and customizing them.

Xeoma supports a large number of modules and brands of USB and IP cameras, Wi-Fi, H.264, MJPEG, MPEG4 and PTZ PTZ cameras and is compatible with all versions of Mac OS and mobile OS. <br><br>  Xeoma features: <br><ul><li>  Full remote access to the system.  Users can control their system from anywhere in the world, adjust settings, view archives, connect / delete cameras, view the view from them in real time via a web browser or mobile devices. <br></li><li>  Detection of movement in a given sector and activation of customized reactions using a special detector.  Protection against false positives allows you to not miss important events. <br></li><li>  Diverse reactions to user-defined events.  The system can generate e-mail notifications with attached photos / videos, upload data to an FTP server, perform automatic unfolding from a minimized state using the Popup window module, start playing a sound file (conditional alarm, siren and alarm notify responsible employees). <br></li><li>  Support for analog, wireless and wired cameras, IP-and USB-cameras, integrated web-cameras, support for PTZ-camera functions (rotate, tilt, zoom). <br></li><li>  No need to install and have administrator rights.  Initial setup is not required.  The solution starts working immediately after downloading and running, with default settings that can be changed later. <br></li><li>  Uninterrupted work on Windows, Linux and Mac platforms.  The program is available in Russian, English, Spanish, German, Dutch and Danish - the list is constantly expanding. <br></li><li>  Broadcast over the Internet.  Users can add a video stream or dynamically updated screenshots to their blog or site, as well as view MJPEG-video / JPEG-photo in a browser using a mobile device. <br>  Modes of operation Xeoma <br></li></ul><br><br>  In the free Xeoma mode, you can use 2 sources of 3 modules each, and in Trial mode you can use an unlimited number of sources and modules, but the settings will be reset every 4 hours and when the program is closed, and the Archive has a limit of 1 hour. <br><br>  The Xeoma video surveillance software is based on the Client-Server architecture and consists of 2 parts - the Xeoma Server and the Xeoma Client. <br>  The server processes cameras and other signal sources and generally does all the work, while the Client is used to view and communicate with the server. <br><br>  Licenses are purchased only on the server side.  No matter how many client parts will be connected to the server, only a server license is needed. Installation and launch of the Xeoma program can work immediately after the download and does not require installation. <br><br>  When you first start Xeoma scans the network in search of available cameras.  All found cameras will be added to the Main window, with the exception of cameras that require authorization - such cameras will be listed in the list in the "+" menu in the bottom panel. <br><br>  Also, the creators of Xeoma provide service "Repeater" <br><br>  This is a service that controls Xeoma, even if the computer is not accessible from the Internet, i.e.  is located on a local network, has a local IP address or is connected via the mobile Internet.  With it, you can access your cameras and the archive, you can publish any of your files on the network. <br><br>  The Xeoma web server allows you to view cameras in real time by connecting this module to the camera, you can view the cameras remotely via a browser (provided you have a real static IP address) from any device. <br><br>  IP camera emulation <br>  If you need to make an IP camera from a web camera (USB camera) that is accessible over the network to other computers or Xeoma Cloud.  In this case, you need to connect the ‚ÄúWeb Server‚Äù module to the desired camera, on the receiving computer this camera will be ‚Äúpicked up‚Äù as an IP camera. <br><br>  Cloud service Xeoma Cloud <br>  Cloud surveillance service without a computer allows you to store information and monitor in the cloud <br><br>  Advantages of Xeoma <br>  Among the main advantages are: <br>  1. Intuitive, clear and easy to use interface, the pride of the program interface based on the principle of the designer, when you can quickly and easily create settings for each camera, just dragging the modules with the mouse. <br>  2. The ability to create a surveillance system of almost any complexity, using a huge system of modules, such as recording on a motion sensor, on schedule, screen capture, remote access and many others. <br>  3. The only program for video surveillance, which works out of the "box", i.e.  after installation, you just need to make a couple of mouse clicks. <br>  4. The possibility of free use without restrictions on the number of cameras (except that without buying a license, the settings are reset when the server is restarted and every 48 hours) <br>  5. Supports any cameras. <br>  6. Implemented excellent background information in each module, filter and program action. <br><br>  disadvantages <br>  1. You need to pay a little bit. <br><br>  Read more about the program here: <a href="http://felenasoft.com/xeoma/ru/description/">felenasoft.com/xeoma/ru/description</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/256373/">https://habr.com/ru/post/256373/</a></p>
