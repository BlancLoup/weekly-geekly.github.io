This event brought together key customers and partners of HP partners in our country, IT journalists and just active players in the information technology industry.  The forum continues the seven-year history of the famous HP Software Worlds conference (HP Software Universe).  This year the topic of the forum went far beyond the scope of the software, which is reflected in the title.  In our opinion, the event only benefited from this.  The theme of the 2011 Forum was innovative approaches to the management of IT and business technology.  The focus, of course, was on HP's vision in this area, but in their reports most of the participants focused on innovation in general, without necessarily binding to the company's decisions. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/a34315ac/ae860e79/603b92d3/6984da27.jpg"></div>

      At the time of the forum in Moscow, more than 600 participants gather - representatives of almost all areas of industry and companies engaged in the field of information technology.  In the framework of the forum, representatives of leading Russian companies speak on the specifics of their work with IT.  Participants share the best solutions of various problems, experience in interacting with new technologies and approaches. <br><br>  In the understanding of HP, an innovative enterprise is notable for its speed, mobility, ability to instantly increase and minimize business processes upon request, and security of data under management.  In English, this concept is called instant-on enterprise. <br><br>  The company executives who came to the forum talked a lot about it: Yves de Talue, senior vice president, head of corporate solutions and managing director of EM in the EMEA region and Rafael Brunini, vice president of HP, general manager of the HP software solutions department in EMEA.  People who hold such high positions in a large leading company, as a rule, have something to say, and their presentations aroused a corresponding interest among the participants. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/be1ca934/7b5523fa/d6f52590/7b56d772.jpg" align="left">  Yves de Taloue mainly talked about what innovations, in his opinion, business should implement at home, and how HP itself is changing in order to comply with changes in the market. <br><br>  The main trend today is clouds, private and public.  With their help, it is easy to implement a hybrid workflow in a company, when part of the business tasks are placed on the resources that are already available, and part of the business processes is put into the clouds.  This helps to seriously optimize the cost of equipment, and from two sides at once: there is no need to purchase new, expensive equipment for new tasks, while the equipment already available in the company is effectively used to support current IT processes.  The level of interest and the scale of demand for clouds can not please the representatives of the company.  Today, HP is the only manufacturer in the world that has a complete solution for organizing private and public clouds: servers, high-speed switches and data storage systems.  Accordingly, companies that already use HP equipment, it is much easier to implement innovative methods of work on the basis of already familiar procedures. <br><br><br>  Another trend has become data security, especially against the backdrop of the explosive growth in the popularity of social networks and the widespread adoption of cloud services.  Companies seeking innovation must take measures to protect their data, while maintaining a balance between security and secrecy. <br><br>  In his report, Yves de Taloux also gave his own forecast for the near future.  In short, we are waiting for an increasing increase in the importance of information management.  That is, from the purely ‚Äúiron‚Äù aspects of data storage and processing, large companies will move to innovative methods of managing accumulated data that bring added value.  For example, they will be able to more accurately guess the expectations and desires of their clients based on the data already available on how they interacted with the company.  Or, for example, to effectively analyze the accumulated statistics on equipment to optimize the product line.  In other words, they become more flexible, scalable, and adaptable to the organization‚Äôs business processes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/6b7d35b7/d7c49f41/18a5ffe4/40cabe6a.jpg" align="right">  Rafael Brunini told about information security in an innovative enterprise.  A modern company active in the market and introducing innovations must necessarily take into account the risks from working with new technologies: clouds, social networks and mobile applications.  At the same time, the perception of risks should be reasonable, for, having separated from technologies, it is impossible to achieve success in the modern market.  It is also important to reduce the response time to any incidents related to the threat to the security of IT systems.  The faster a company responds to emerging threats, the less damage they can potentially cause.  However, with an increase in the reaction rate, it is very important not to get carried away with the process and not to spend extra money - amid falling IT budgets, this will be very helpful. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/562a6713/b95af51b/5390f810/5e8bae46.jpg" align="left">  In addition to the reports of HP EMEA representatives, General Director of HP in Russia, Alexander Mikoyan, said that HP tasks for the near future can be defined for simplicity as ensuring the provision of services and information anywhere, anytime.  This applies both to HP itself and to the partners of the company using its equipment and solutions to provide services to its customers. <br><br>  The Forum itself was not as formal as it might seem.  In the wide corridors of the "Slavyanskaya" met long-familiar people who are engaged in a common and useful business for the country.  It was nice to see that technical sessions, interesting, as a rule, to a narrow circle of people, attracted so many people that in some rooms there was literally no place for an apple to fall.  Of particular interest were sessions on HP Cloud Service Automation and 3PAR storage systems. <br><br>  The Forum also ended very informally - with a big buffet and a concert of the legendary rockers BI-2. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/5b549633/5c9e70af/c9195e87/29b5b2bd.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/130598/">https://habr.com/ru/post/130598/</a></p>
