Despite the fact that all companies that the law may relate to in one way or another were aware of this date, far from all had time to prepare for the entry into force of the law.  On average, only every tenth of the clients of the largest data centers <a href="http://kommersant.ru/doc/2800432">reports</a> , Kommersant <a href="http://kommersant.ru/doc/2800432">reports</a> .  In addition, not only foreign, but also local companies are now transferring data to Russia, because, due to the devaluation of the ruble, prices for data storage services in the country began to cost less than similar services abroad. <br><br>  Now only about 10% of the clients of the twenty largest data processing providers in Russia have managed to complete the data transfer to the Russian Federation.  In any case, the study of two companies at once, Telecom Exchange and 42 Future, says so.  ‚ÄúCustomers show a fairly high interest in this topic, but they are clearly already late in its implementation.  The problem is the lack of understanding of companies, how exactly it is necessary to change the IT infrastructure and business processes, ‚Äùthe authors note.  Thus, in a number of situations, customers transferred only some of their systems, and for the rest, they stopped activity, waiting for clarifications and additions from regulators, "the study says. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  There are exceptions, including several of the largest DCs in Russia.  This, for example, DataLine (included in the Inline Technologies Group).  In just one year, this company had about twenty new customers from abroad.  In addition, DataPro was able to get 5 or more foreign customers, and its overseas customers transferred data by about 80%.  As for the company Selectel, foreign customers also appeared here, although only 10% of their clients transferred personal data to Russia.

      According to iKS-Consulting, in 2014 the volume of the Russian market of DC increased by almost 30% to 11.9 billion rubles.  The total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe machine halls of commercial data centers in Russia reached 86 thousand square meters.  m, and the number of racks - 25.5 thousand. The largest data center provider in Russia is DataLine, which has seven data centers with 2.6 thousand racks.  The top 5 also includes MMTS-9, TrustInfo, Selectel and DataPro. <br><br>  It is worth recalling that the amendments to the law ‚ÄúOn Personal Data‚Äù, according to which companies are obliged to store personal data of Russians on servers that are located on the territory of Russia, come into force today.  Those companies that do not have time to fulfill this requirement will be entered in the register of violators, with the subsequent possibility of blocking.  In Russia, approximately 2.6 million organizations are subject to the new law. <br><br>  As mentioned above, now not only foreign, but also domestic companies are coming to Russia, the reason for which is the devaluation of the ruble.  ‚ÄúDue to the devaluation of the ruble, prices for data center services in Russia have become lower than abroad, and political sentiments and various exercises in the event of Russia's disconnection from the Internet are pushing to store data in the country.  Our important customers are also system integrators who act as intermediaries and often rent power for their customers, ‚Äùcommented DataPro executive director Evgeny Bogdanchikov. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/294108/">https://habr.com/ru/post/294108/</a></p>
