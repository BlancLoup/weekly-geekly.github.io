Now every winter, about one million people around the world congratulate <a href="http://postcardsforfriends.com/">us with our postcards</a> .

      Read more about the secret of success.  (+ a card of this year for memory :) <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  So how it all began </h4><br>  There were not many customers, for 2 years of work, maybe a few dozen.  I wanted to congratulate them on the New Year, but I also wanted to know more about our ‚Äútalented and wonderful‚Äù people in the New Year as much as possible of their friends, friends of their friends, etc.  In general, to be noticed, appreciated and ‚Äúloaded‚Äù with work. <br><br>  They say that in toasts and greetings they usually want what they themselves lack.  So we wished "Financial well-being in the New Year!".  A postcard was made on a flash - a small cartoon with an intrigue at the beginning and an unexpected turn of events at the end - the name of the recipient inside the cartoon. <br><br>  A proprietary "chip" was the opportunity not only to see for yourself, but also to congratulate a friend.  That was what the cartoon ended with.  Moreover, the friend's name was inserted into the card for a friend, which the user specified when sending.  It turned out very such a "not weak" viral effect. <br>  Back in 2002, out of several dozens of postcards we sent to our clients and friends, a wave of several thousand greetings was received.  In their native Dnipropetrovsk, the Reactor company was recognized and began to notice, tenders began to be won much more often, because then many companies congratulated their colleagues and relatives. <br><br>  8 years have passed since then, every year we made a postcard, congratulated our friends, customers and partners, but every year more and more and our partners congratulated their friends partners and colleagues, who in turn ... well, you understood :) <br><br>  In general, since that time, we have already made a new design, translated the postcards into English for our foreign friends and opened the domain <a href="http://postcardsforfriends.com/">postcardsforfriends.com</a> , added some Adwords and started earning a good New Year corporate event every year.  The Reactor company has already stopped making websites, but is developing the project Work.ua, and only postcards continue to go tirelessly every winter ... <br><br>  Last year they were sent more than 1,000,000 pieces. <br><br>  In general, Happy New Year, and may the new year you are lucky as we are or even more.  Financial well-being to all in the New Year! <br>  Oh yes, and a postcard for you (while English, we start there a little earlier, on the occasion of a crisis): <a href="http://postcardsforfriends.com/xmas-1/view.php%3Fn%3D%25D0%25A1%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D1%2589%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%2520%25D0%25A5%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B1%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25A5%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B1%25D1%2580">http://postcardsforfriends.com/xmas-1/view.php?n=hbr</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/110140/">https://habr.com/ru/post/110140/</a></p>
