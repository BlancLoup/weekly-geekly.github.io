After all, the "game" means the top, the most powerful stuffing.  This, of course, dictates a certain price level.  In addition, a powerful processor and video card always required an appropriate cooling system, which is not easy to fit into a limited amount of notebook, while maintaining the comfort of working with the device.  So gaming laptops have always been a kind of technological frontier, the cutting edge of personal computers.  Therefore, not only the characteristics, but also how such machines cope with modern demanding games, always arouse interest.  For example, this new model of gaming laptop, ASUS G751JT. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  This is the average model from the G751J notebook line.  It differs from the older one with a slightly weaker video card (NVidia GTX970M instead of GTX980M) and a processor (Intel Core i7-4710 instead of i7-4860). <br><br><h4>  Specifications (underlined those that correspond to the considered sample): </h4><br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Processor</b> : Intel¬Æ Core ‚Ñ¢ i7-4710HQ <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>OS</b> : <br>  Windows 8.1 Pro <br>  <u>Windows 8.1</u> <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Chipset</b> : Intel¬Æ HM87 Express <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>RAM</b> : DDR3L SDRAM 16 GB (up to 32 GB) <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Display</b> : 17, .3 "16: 9 IPS FHD (1920x1080), anti-reflective coating <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Video card</b> : NVIDIA¬Æ GeForce¬Æ GTX970M, 3 GB GDDR5 <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Drives</b> : <br>  1 TB HDD 7200 + 256 GB SSD <br>  <u>2 TB HDD 7200 + 128 GB SSD</u> <br>  1 TB HDD 5400 + 8 GB SSD <br>  <b>Optical drive</b> : <br>  Blu-ray dvd combo <br>  <u>Super Multi DVD</u> <br>  Blue ray writer <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Card reader</b> : 2-in-1 (SD / MMC) <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Webcam</b> <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Network modules</b> : <br>  802.11a / b / g / n / ac <br>  Bluetooth ‚Ñ¢ V4.0 <br>  10/100/1000 / Gigabits Base T <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Connectors</b> : <br>  1 x microphone <br>  2 x SPDIF <br>  1 x line input <br>  1 x VGA / Mini D-sub 15-pin <br>  4 x USB 3.0 <br>  1 x Mini DisplayPort or Mini DisplayPort / Thunderbolt (optional) <br>  1 x RJ45 LAN <br>  1 x HDMI <br>  1 x SD card reader <br>  1 x power connector <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Audio</b> : Built-in speakers, subwoofer and microphone.

Included are: user manual, cable tie for cables and power supply.  It is large and heavy, because it has to feed a very powerful stuffing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a60/a61/463/a60a6146315d420f9cbe9d223a660ba5.jpg"><br><br>  The laptop itself is big, thick and heavy.  Taking in hand, you immediately realize that this device is designed for serious battles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/89d/588/adb/89d588adb54d42049bae6bb20b0d55a7.jpg"><br><br>  The cover is made of matte dark gray, almost black, soft-touch plastic.  It is very pleasant to the touch, not smooth and not rough.  In the middle of the lid an inset is made of plastic styled as brushed aluminum with ASUS logos and the Republic of Gamers product line. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/df1/835/a2d/df1835a2d23f42138392dffb828b8a3c.jpg"><br><br>  The back, where the battery is usually located, is thicker and wider than usual.  Here are located powerful plate radiators, covered with decorative grilles of red plastic. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ee0/f7a/624/ee0f7a624ff544a3bf76f2853282cd5b.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/459/287/ff4/459287ff4a7649c29af8b0427053483b.jpg"><br><br>  The bottom of the notebook is made of textured plastic and has a complex surface configuration. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/90f/134/c79/90f134c79aaf403dab7781ee4e683178.jpg"><br><br>  Under the big cover in the center are the memory modules and removable drives.  A small subwoofer is hidden under the net. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fa7/d4d/f12/fa7d4df12d6c4414a4774eb633e79d04.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ac7/1fb/41f/ac71fb41f56e482e99d3077ff8080fc4.jpg"><br><br>  On the left side are: <br>  ‚Ä¢ Kensington lock <br>  ‚Ä¢ Two USB 3.0 connectors <br>  ‚Ä¢ Optical drive <br>  ‚Ä¢ Card reader <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3f8/5ad/af6/3f85adaf61654dc79474414b1ddb3889.jpg"><br><br>  On the right side are located: <br>  ‚Ä¢ Headphone / SPDIF connector <br>  ‚Ä¢ microphone jack <br>  ‚Ä¢ Line in <br>  ‚Ä¢ Two USB 3.0 connectors (the left one is marked with a lightning bolt, allows you to charge external device batteries) <br>  ‚Ä¢ Mini DisplayPort / Thunderbolt port <br>  ‚Ä¢ HDMI port <br>  ‚Ä¢ VGA connector <br>  ‚Ä¢ Power connector <br><br>  Quite a rich assortment of connectors.  For example, the same linear input, designed to connect external audio sources and create audio recordings.  The abundance of video ports (Mini DisplayPort / Thunderbolt, HDMI, VGA) allows you to display an image on various external devices to show others their gaming skills. <br><br>  There are only a few white LEDs on the front. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/53f/eb8/33b/53feb833ba71483daec25a3f43b51ccf.jpg"><br><br>  The maximum opening angle is not too large in modern times, but is no longer required.  The laptop is simply not designed to climb under the blanket with the sofa and chat in social networks; he needs a table, a gaming mouse, a headset and a comfortable chair. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/67d/02e/c50/67d02ec5003d488b8862630b5a512972.jpg"><br><br>  The display diagonal is 17.3 inches, the frame is made of matte plastic. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8a9/0f7/2d5/8a90f72d57074084857d51c49f95a773.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6c7/65e/60a/6c765e60a26a446e80297df58c2d7355.jpg"><br><br>  There is a camera on top, a work indicator on the left, and microphones on the edges. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5d6/695/b89/5d6695b899c3447a9d2a77923061e570.jpg"><br><br>  The keyboard panel is made of dark gray matte plastic.  The keys themselves are black, their surface is slightly smoother, but the fingers do not slip, it is comfortable to work.  The key stroke is soft, they do not warp, rattle or click. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5f8/8c8/9ee/5f88c89ee48b4ce2a11771b19c8751a4.jpg"><br><br>  The power button is beautifully styled aluminum with a texture of concentric grinding.  During operation, it is illuminated from the inside by a red LED. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7fe/a2f/687/7fea2f687e1c4d81b57c070ed6590d84.jpg"><br><br>  The dimensions of the laptop allowed to place an island keyboard, which is good news.  Although it was not possible to completely duplicate the traditional scheme, this set of keys is much more convenient than with most notebooks of a smaller form factor. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d00/dd2/c93/d00dd2c930f940ba945b94c6589b58eb.jpg"><br><br>  In the upper left corner of the digital block is a key with the logo of the Republic of Gamers.  When it is pressed, a multifunctional application is launched, which I will discuss below. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b2c/a8b/d0b/b2ca8bd0b76a4680bb43426ee5519138.jpg"><br><br>  Above the Esc key are 5 additional keys (from left to right): <br>  ‚Ä¢ this is not turning on the webcam, but launching the NVidia GeForce Experience window, from where you can activate the ShadowPlay function <br>  ‚Ä¢ launch service Steam <br>  ‚Ä¢ three macro keys <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aa7/77e/155/aa777e15553a4a778b815deac7d7dfc6.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/38e/852/3ef/38e8523efec34b6ab600072a013237b3.jpg"><br><br>  The touchpad is a large area, which makes it much more accurate to position the cursor.  Various multi-touch gestures are supported.  The buttons under it are also large, with a very soft and precise move, made of rough plastic, which makes them easy to find without looking. <br><br>  Under the touchpad buttons are LED indicators with corresponding symbols.  As you remember, the same indicators are on the front side of the laptop.  That is, you can get an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe operation of certain systems with the lid closed, but at the same time, you do not have to lean back to see the operating indicators. <br><br>  The keyboard is equipped with a red backlight with adjustable brightness (Fn + F3 ... F4).  A total of three levels of brightness are available, not counting the total off of the backlight. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4e4/6d8/8cf/4e46d88cf97d4912a5904b2a258fe386.jpg"><br><br>  Pay attention to the more ‚Äúfat‚Äù backlighting around the WASD keys - pleasant care about the players, in the dark you can not read the inscriptions on the keys.  By the way, the symbols of the Cyrillic alphabet do not glow, they are simply painted, unlike all other inscriptions and symbols. <br><br><h4>  Display </h4><br>  The ASUS G751JT display uses an IPS matrix, so color distortion does not occur when the tilt angle changes.  The horizontal viewing angle is 178 degrees, the quality of color rendering is high.  Particularly pleased with the matte surface of the screen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/286/1e1/237/2861e12377e144d0bb52ef080ca4464d.jpg"><br><br>  With a 17.3-inch diagonal, the resolution of 1920x1080 is the golden mean: the image is fairly smooth, but there is no Windows-specific problem when the interface elements become too small.  In addition, a higher resolution would create an additional load on the video card during games. <br><br><h4>  Software </h4><br>  On the considered instance of the laptop was installed Windows 8.1 (not Pro), with a standard set of applications.  There are also a number of proprietary ASUS applications that I would like to mention. <br><br>  First of all, this is ROG Gaming Center.  This application is just launched by pressing a key in the numeric keypad: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e91/af8/f26/e91af8f26d7d40719418457d20498039.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4a7/d44/eae/4a7d44eaed6b4742aef4b0797a10f5f8.jpg"><br><br>  At first, it seems that the wallpaper on the desktop just changed.  But this is just such an interface.  The three diamond tiles contain information modules: time / date / weather, congestion of RAM, free space on the hard drive.  In the upper left corner, you can activate one of the four game profiles.  When you click on the diamond ‚ÄúGame Profile Settings‚Äù, the following screen appears: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/249/d15/f76/249d15f76c0846e99ae38bcd1404bddf.jpg"><br><br>  I think everything is clear and without explanation. <br><br>  When you click on a ASUS MacroKey diamond (by the way, there is a typo, it says MarcoKey), the macro settings utility is launched, initialized with the m1 ... m3 keys in the upper left corner of the keyboard. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b2c/a8b/d0b/b2ca8bd0b76a4680bb43426ee5519138.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/073/d39/991/073d39991ac04ec584b72a4cb75f54bc.jpg"><br><br>  "Under" diamond "Multimedia Setup Wizard" hides the equalizer: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d62/442/5d8/d624425d854f4ca9b70bde28b4c03ed3.jpg"><br><br>  And this window appears when you click on the ASUS Splendid rhombus: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7a0/b76/76e/7a0b7676e89841058c537dd3f37022b6.jpg"><br><br>  Here you can customize the color gamut of the image, depending on the specific task. <br><br>  There are still unexamined applications invoked by two other additional keys.  The Camera launches the ShadowPlay feature from the NVidia GeForce Experience app: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/865/431/38b/86543138b522435fb1ee037f5189d1cb.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c22/8cc/d01/c228ccd011054a2b91e5458a050ec372.jpg"><br><br>  This tool allows you to record 10-20 minutes of video in a video in the background.  This can be useful for players who want to share special gaming moments with friends or make educational materials. <br><br>  Finally, pressing the Steam key launches the full-screen GUI of the corresponding application: <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Hidden text</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/75e/1b0/d88/75e1b0d882e4434ab6d18bc7921cdabc.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/181/794/ad4/181794ad47dc41b9a1c0427eb07e9d3a.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d49/e66/5fd/d49e665fdb5144e9834d90602a4fb39d.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/66c/8d6/c3e/66c8d6c3ecd34690a2bdc0138ca26829.jpg"></div></div><br><br>  It has the same functionality as the well-known Steam client.  It is difficult to say why it was necessary to fence a separate shell, and even make it launch on a separate key.  None other than lobbying interests from Valve itself. <br><br><h4>  Performance and work experience </h4><br>  The computing power of the laptop is provided by an Intel Core i7 4710HQ processor operating at 2.5 GHz.  The computer's RAM is 16 GB, more than enough for even the most modern and demanding games. <br><br>  The laptop loads <b>very</b> quickly.  I do not know how the developers managed to achieve this, but the login menu appears already after 9 seconds after pressing the power button.  Probably, the capabilities of the system SSD are very well used here. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a76/992/a2f/a76992a2fc954fdb97b4d4d34954a7e2.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/09e/93b/19b/09e93b19b0344cbdb4188df1fd064ea1.jpg"><br><br>  Its performance is: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/412/280/f62/412280f6298c45b3ac579f39c7694c3f.jpg"><br><br>  The video card uses discrete NVidia GeForce 970M with 3 GB of memory. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6bb/a9b/7b5/6bba9b7b546e431a873c8e826a5ba188.gif"><br><br>  Benchmark Unigine Heaven Benchmark 4.0 results (settings are set to maximum): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f3d/a3b/ded/f3da3bded5f14b6f842fe5c58f5810ac.jpg"><br><br>  Benchmark 3D Mark Advanced Edition 1.3.708 benchmark results: <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Hidden text</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b48/59d/6db/b4859d6dbeb241c18d3ac317517debeb.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/97b/37a/607/97b37a6075bc4ea0838013217624163c.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bb9/ce5/0d6/bb9ce50d6c2944b4b622637a3825d874.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/360/550/5db/3605505dbf65412483a0014259048f99.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/66c/0bf/242/66c0bf2428d941568f8d6bed2f59229f.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8a7/110/db2/8a7110db204e48d0a111b829db8e0f59.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/83f/c08/b4e/83fc08b4eac34a95a4f87138a66a0e9e.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1a0/64d/599/1a064d5999154207bae6ebc6d62ba609.jpg"><br></div></div><br><br>  I tested the laptop not only in synthetic tests, but also in Battlefield 4. The settings were twisted to Ultra, while the number of FPS ranged from 40 to 65, an average of 55. At the same time, the laptop worked almost silently during Internet surfing.  Only occasionally there was a slight rustle of blown air, but the noise level did not even come close to the level of discomfort.  After a few tens of minutes of the game, the laptop case became only slightly warmer.  ASUS engineers managed to make a very efficient and relatively compact cooling system. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e95/38b/b42/e9538bb423c84b86a5979164be8f52a0.jpg"><br><br>  Regarding the sound of the built-in subwoofer, do not feed any illusions: this is just a small speaker with all the ensuing consequences.  There is no talk of any bass, at best, it reproduces trimmed mid frequencies.  But when you connect headphones, the sound quality turned out to be very decent and detailed.  I did not twist the equalizer and listened with the basic settings.  And I was impressed by the sound of games and music of various genres. <br><br>  It took about two hours to fully charge the battery.  In the surfing mode with periodic viewing of videos, the laptop worked all day.  And with games and benchmarks, I put the battery in about three hours. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  Power notebook allows you to comfortably play the most modern games, do not hesitate to set the maximum settings.  The cooling system was surprisingly effective. <br><br>  Also from the advantages of the device: <br>  ‚Ä¢ excellent image quality, <br>  ‚Ä¢ matte display, <br>  ‚Ä¢ large and comfortable keyboard, <br>  ‚Ä¢ at least a convenient touchpad, <br>  ‚Ä¢ the possibility of self-replacement drives <br>  ‚Ä¢ a large number of connectors. <br><br>  The disadvantages include a large weight of the laptop and its dimensions, but this is a consequence of its large capabilities, and not a lack of design.  Also seemed to me an extra key Steam. <br><br>  Who can recommend this laptop?  The answer is obvious - avid gamers.  Especially those who do not have too much free space for a powerful desktop gaming computer.  Also, ASUS G75JT will appeal to lovers of various gaming tournaments, congresses and LAN parties.  Still, this laptop will carry much more convenient than a full-fledged system unit.  Actually, three different connectors for connecting external display devices both hint and contribute to the high social activity of the owner of this powerful machine. <br><br>  The second category of users who may be interested in this device are specialists in 3D graphics and its enthusiasts.  Of course, larger displays are preferable for such tasks, but they may be interesting as an auxiliary, relatively compact and to some extent mobile G751JT device. <br><br>  Recommended retail price: 83990 rubles.  However, retail prices can vary quite significantly.  There are two reasons for this.  First, within the framework of the gaming G-series there will be quite a lot of configurations that differ markedly from each other, which will also affect the price.  And secondly, exchange rate fluctuations can also seriously affect retail prices. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/364449/">https://habr.com/ru/post/364449/</a></p>
