      And these are not empty words.  According to various studies, online chat rooms really help to achieve this.  <b>So, if only 5 years ago, only 38% of buyers in American online stores used online consultants, now - 58%.</b>  Moreover, <a href="https://d26a57ydsghvgx.cloudfront.net/content/resources/zendesk-benchmark-Q1-2015.pdf">according to Zendesk research,</a> interaction via online chat turned out to be the most convenient way of communication from the point of view of customers - 92% satisfaction out of 100 possible in this way. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d81/eaa/b70/d81eaab707ca4b4aa1f6e50606c4979f.jpg"><br><br>  And only after online consultants, there is voice communication (88%), use of forms on the website (85%), E-mail (85%), Facebook (84%), Twitter (77%) and other means of communication. <br><br>  And in <a href="http://www.emarketer.com/Article/How-Helpful-Live-Chat/1007235">this study</a> from Emarketer.com, it is reported that chat rooms directly provide an average of 38% of online sales. <br><br><h4>  What does all this mean? </h4><br><br>  It is easier for many visitors to write to the online chat than to talk with you on the phone, fill out a form or write an E-mail directly.  They are satisfied with this channel of interaction.  It is convenient to use. <br><br>  This was just a brief introduction to highlight the importance of online consultants. <br><br>  <b>So, there are two types of online chat:</b> <br>  1. Inactive (open only after clicking on the chat icon) <br>  2. Active (open automatically depending on actions, session duration, use sounds and animation to attract attention, visit <br><br>  <b>Inactive chat rooms are like consultants in stores that are willing to help, but you need to ask for it.</b>  The only problem is that many will not do this, but simply leave.  The same situation can be on the site. <br><br>  <b>Active chats are more aggressive.</b>  <b>They, as consultants who are at the right time in the right place, offer their help (sometimes they are even too intrusive) and answer all the questions that arise (encouraging them to make a purchase) rather than waiting for your actions.</b>  Here, of course, there is a very thin line between obsession and benefit.  And most importantly - to find a middle ground, so as not to annoy, but to help. <br><br><h4>  Do online chats increase conversion rates? </h4><br><br>  In most cases, yes!  But not always.  Tests show that online chat can reduce it.  Further a few positive and negative cases. <br><br>  <i>Article in the topic - <a href="http://boosta.ru/various/vas-razdrazhayut-vyletayushhie-pop-apy-kogda-xotite-zakryt-sajt/">Using pop-ups to increase site conversion</a></i> <br><br>  For example, using online chat on the website of an online store for winter clothing, <a href="http://www.monetate.com/blog/website-testing-wins-live-chat-converts-better/">Monetate</a> has increased the average check by 3%.  During the test, this increased revenue by $ 20,000, and for the year by about $ 130,000. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aa3/525/87f/aa352587f75c44bc98ff134ca12d53ce.jpg"><br><br>  In one of the <a href="https://vwo.com/blog/live-chat-increases-signups/">VWO company's tests, the</a> number of registrations increased by 31% due to the online consultant <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/498/d98/5e8/498d985e8a3541889865c8e5d0691044.jpg"><br><br>  And here is the negative KISSmetrics case.  They tested the effectiveness of online chat on three pages of their site: Features, Customers and Pricing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/356/935/d19/356935d19bf94d26bc5b214a5e5c5a2e.png"><br><br>  In the test version (using the online consultant), the number of registrations decreased by 8.59%, and the conversion at the next stage of the sales funnel decreased by 22% altogether. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/84e/903/983/84e903983ba44f86875f2f6ec61c382b.png"><br><br>  Perhaps this was due to the fact that the appearance and fields in the chat left much to be desired.  Yes, it would be worth working on.  But this is not the most important thing to take out of this case. <br><br>  An expert to increase conversion, Craig Sullivan tested the effect of online chat on conversion rate.  He launched several experiments with the following hypotheses: <br><br><ul><li>  online chat will increase conversion </li><li>  online chat will reduce customer support costs </li><li>  online chat will improve the quality of support </li></ul><br><br>  After testing, no hypothesis was confirmed.  <b>There were no significant changes in terms of conversion.</b>  <b>Customer support costs have not decreased.</b>  <b>The productivity of the staff did not increase, as visitors came to the site unevenly, as a result of which part of the time support was overloaded, part was completely free.</b> <br><br>  <b>However, Craig is sure that online chat rooms are helpful.</b>  <b>Just use them in the right context.</b>  For example, they are effective for startups at the initial stage, when the feedback of potential customers is needed as oxygen.  They are also effective at the stage when a person makes a purchasing decision.  It is at this crucial moment that an online consultant can dispel remaining concerns that prevent a potential client from clicking on the ‚ÄúPay‚Äù button. <br><br><h4>  Why these successful and negative cases? </h4><br><br>  Besides, an effective online chat is much more than just installing it on a site and assigning one employee to it.  This is a serious decision that implies the training of personnel, the elaboration of new business processes, the understanding of the target audience, the elaboration of all possible situations. <br><br>  In general, the introduction of online chats is one of the ideas of A / B testing, which almost always has a positive effect on conversion rates.  We wrote about this on our blog <a href="http://boosta.ru/">Boosta.r</a> u in the article <a href="http://boosta.ru/ab-testirovanie/advice/otvety-na-20-samyx-rasprostranennyx-voprosov-po-ab-testirovaniyu/">‚ÄúAnswers to the 20 most common A / B testing questions‚Äù</a> <br><br><h4>  Who uses online chat rooms at all? </h4><br><br>  <b>Some statistics from the <a href="http://www.softwareadvice.com/crm/industryview/demographics-live-chat-report-2015/">Software Advice</a> :</b> <br><br>  - 56% of respondents at least once used an online chat on the site to get an answer to a question <br>  - 49% of respondents prefer online chat rooms to other methods of communication with minor purchases in online stores, while with more serious purchases, in financial matters 74% of participants prefer telephone communication <br>  - 56% of respondents aged from 18 to 34 prefer online chat to telephone, while the same indicator for people over 35 years old is equal to 27%. <br><br>  346 people participated in this survey, so in reality there can be certain deviations from the indicated figures.  Nevertheless, it is obvious that a young audience is more inclined to use online chat than an old one. <br><br><h4>  Why do site visitors prefer online chat rooms? </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ab5/960/e62/ab5960e628c54352a97c2f0ba841861f.jpg"><br><br>  <b>The reasons are as follows:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  quickly (of course, if the help desk is working correctly) </li><li>  conveniently </li><li>  there is a record of communication </li><li>  easy to combine with other matters </li><li>  can be used at work (especially important for an audience between the ages of 25 and 54) </li></ul><br>  <b>And the first two factors are most significant for a young audience, who are used to having all communication via the Internet.</b>  So, if your target audience is young, then using online chat is a must-have.  If you want to be on the same wavelength with them, then you need to match their needs and preferences. <br><br>  They want to get answers to their questions online, without any extra calls - give them that.  And that's all.  Just follow their preferences. <br><br>  <b>If your target audience is old and you are selling something relatively expensive, then online chat is unlikely to help.</b>  Although it still needs to be tested in each case. <br><br>  <i>Article in the topic - <a href="http://boosta.ru/various/uznaj-svoyu-celevuyu-auditoriyu-ili-umri-34-zhiznenno-vazhnyx-voprosa/">Know your target audience or die: 34 vital questions</a></i> <br><br><h4>  Online consultant = source of clients.  How to achieve this? </h4><br><br>  Using the example of two cases in the middle of an article, you should have already understood that simply installing an online chat can even lead to a decrease in the number of applications from the site. <br><br>  If the chat is horrible in terms of design, text, content, it will only repel potential customers. <br><br>  If it flies out a second after it hits the site, it will be hated along with your site (yes, by the way, pop-ups on the main pages, which crawl out of all the cracks a second after entry, wildly strain many visitors). <br><br><blockquote>  If your support officer answers only after 10 minutes, then the online chat will not be a source of customers, but their ‚Äúkiller‚Äù. </blockquote><br><br>  That is why we have prepared a list of tips that you need to keep before your eyes during the installation of an online consultant on the site.  This checklist is based on the <a href="http://conversionxl.com/how-to-make-live-chat-convert/">opinion of foreign experts</a> on the increase in conversion, the creators of online chat rooms Carrotquest.io, Redhelper.ru, Jivosite.ru, Livetex.ru, Cleversite.ru. <br><br>  1. Prepare employees who will communicate with customers in an online chat. <br><br>  The quality and effectiveness of the online consultant directly depends on who is on the other side.  If your employee does not understand the target audience, her needs, poorly versed in the product, he will not be able to give a qualitative answer to the question. <br><br>  The same problem arises if there are too many requests for one employee at the same time.  As a result, he does not have time to quickly respond to all questions, and the quality of answers suffers due to lack of time. <br><br>  Result? <br><br>  <b>The potential client dies for you.</b> <br><br>  This is especially true of the speed of response.  Imagine the situation ... You are looking for something on the Internet, you open several sites at once to view the assortment, analyze prices, find the cheapest / fastest delivery, etc. <br><br>  And you have the same very important question, the answer to which you need to get here and now.  You ask this question in online consultants on 3 sites. <br><br>  Company A responds after 15 seconds (and already establishes the first contact with you), company B - after 2 minutes (it is a little behind, because you are communicating with company A, you may not open the second tab), company C - after 7 minutes (it has already died for you: employees of the first two companies have already established contact with you and are leading through the sales funnel). <br><br>  Below on the graph you can see how quickly customer satisfaction decreases depending on the length of waiting for an answer: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/357/357/b08/357357b085ef44539ab411cdf4797206.jpg"><br><br><blockquote>  If in the online chat you cannot answer the client's question within 30-50 seconds, then the chances of ‚Äúwinning‚Äù him quickly decrease.  If you can‚Äôt answer within 5 minutes, then there is no point in increasing the conversion. </blockquote><br><br>  <b>Key points:</b> train employees (they should know everything about the target audience and product), distribute employees correctly so that they can quickly answer all questions within 30-50 seconds. <br><br><h4>  2. Widget location </h4><br><br>  <b>First, the online chat should be on those pages where the visitor makes a decision.</b>  For example, product card, basket, payment process, etc.  At these stages, he may have questions about the cost of delivery, the duration of delivery, delivery time, payment options and much more.  The location of the online chat on these pages allows you to quickly get an answer. <br><br>  <b>Secondly, the widget should always be in sight of the visitor</b> .  Do not hide the icon in the footer of the page that no one will ever get to.  Do not make the icon too small and inconspicuous.  The easier it is to find, the better. <br><br>  Some people advise placing the online chat widget on the right or left side depending on the site structure.  Most often, this option fits more organically into the overall structure. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ea0/ce5/a07/ea0ce5a077c140029dd44ec6d3c78025.png"><br><br>  <b>Also make sure that the online chat does not close important information on the site: prices, contacts, etc.</b>  In addition to the location, the chat should fit into the design of the site.  Therefore, adjust its color, size, font to the overall appearance. <br><br><h4>  3. Use auto messaging and templates. </h4><br><br>  <b>Auto-messages can reduce the time of the first response.</b>  <b>Thanks to this, you will be able to make contact with a potential client within the first 30 seconds.</b> <br><br>  If the same questions are constantly asked in an online chat, then templates allow you to save time on writing the same answers. <br><br>  Result? <br>  <b>You unload your support staff, so that they can better concentrate on complex and non-standard issues.</b> <b><br></b> <br>  Important: just do not overdo it with templates, because  this can make communication very formal and repulsive. <br><br>  And remember that any template before sending can be adjusted for each specific situation.  And it is much easier than writing a message from scratch. <br><br><h4>  4. Keep a history of correspondence for visitors and for yourself </h4><br><br>  Why is this important for visitors? <br><br>  <b>After the conversation, they will be able to return to this information if they have forgotten something.</b>  If the correspondence is not saved, they either start the conversation again, or leave the site altogether. <br><br>  In such a situation it is also very important to collect e-mail addresses of those with whom you communicate.  This can be done by personally asking to leave the address, or using a special form in the chat.  Knowing the e-mail, you can duplicate the conversation to the mail or even continue the conversation there.  By the way, the number of users who prefer this kind of interaction is growing every day. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f29/2aa/82c/f292aa82c55e42f28bf37e1a5d350887.png"><br><br>  <b>Another plus of having an e-mail address is the ability to write an answer, even if the visitor left the site without waiting for the support service.</b>  Most likely you have already lost it, but it‚Äôs definitely necessary to give an answer.  Some of these visitors can be converted into customers. <br><br>  Why is this important to you? <br><br><blockquote>  Correspondence with the target audience is simply incredibly important information.  This is the information that you cannot get from Google Analytics, from Yandex.Metrica. This is not quantitative data, but qualitative.  Straight from the mouth of potential customers. </blockquote><br><br>  <b>It is very useful to periodically review the history of communication with the target audience.</b>  Thanks to this, you will better understand their needs, see what questions they ask, what problems they experience when performing a targeted action.  And knowing all of the above, you will immediately have ideas on how to improve the site, product, texts, page structure, etc. <br><br>  By the way, you can ask questions yourself to your target audience. <br><br>  <b>For example:</b> <b><br></b> <br><ul><li>  How did you hear about us? </li><li>  What prevents you from making a purchase? </li><li>  Did you find the information you were looking for? </li><li>  What functions for you are the most important in our product? </li></ul><br><br>  There can be a lot of similar questions.  On the <a href="http://boosta.ru/">Boosta.ru</a> website, we devoted a whole article to this topic, <a href="http://boosta.ru/various/uznaj-svoyu-celevuyu-auditoriyu-ili-umri-34-zhiznenno-vazhnyx-voprosa/">‚ÄúGet to know your target audience or die: 34 vital questions</a> . <a href="http://boosta.ru/various/uznaj-svoyu-celevuyu-auditoriyu-ili-umri-34-zhiznenno-vazhnyx-voprosa/">‚Äù</a> <br><br>  Anyway, but the better you know your target audience, the better you build communication with it, create a selling site structure, describe your product / service. I hope everyone knows that you need to describe the product with the words your potential customer uses?  And this is where the ‚Äúright‚Äù online consultant with a communication history can help. <br><br><h4>  5. Give full answers, write more messages. </h4><br><br>  According to Zendesk, there is a link between the number of responses and the level of visitor satisfaction. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6ec/510/997/6ec51099728e4182bc84153711b4f369.jpg"><br><br>  <b>When you actively communicate in an online chat with a potential client, answer all his questions, then a positive opinion about the company is subconsciously formed.</b>  And the likelihood that he will be satisfied and make a purchase increases. <br><br>  This is just my opinion.  In another way, the relationship between the number of messages and customer satisfaction, I can not explain.  In any case, high-quality and active support will please anyone.  It is a fact. <br><br><h4>  6. Train your operators in up-sell and cross-sell sales technicians. </h4><br><br>  Why is it important? <br><br><blockquote>  If a support employee has the skills to sell up-sell and cross-sell, then he can not only improve the conversion into purchases, but also increase the average bill in the company. </blockquote><br>  Perhaps this will be an additional cost in terms of training.  But in the long run these investments should pay off. <br><br>  In addition, it is not enough just to answer the client's question.  We need to look at it more widely - if, for example, a visitor asks about the availability of goods in stock, but he is not, the best option would be not just to answer the question, but also to offer an alternative.  Offer to leave your contact information and notify the person about the appearance of the desired product in the warehouse, or immediately advise him of an alternative, but close to the parameters of the product. <br><br><h4>  7. Show personal data of the operator </h4><br><br>  <b>Potential customers want to talk to real people.</b>  <b>They want to see the first name, last name, position, photo.</b>  <b>Real information is credible.</b>  Show them that.  Any online consultant has these options. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d89/cf5/f75/d89cf5f751f345279211d4c8420a5efc.png"><br><br>  No need instead of normal photos to show Hollywood stars that have no relation to your business.  Same thing with made-up funny names.  Perhaps this is creative.  But this is not credible to the company. <br><br><h4>  8. Integrate chat with third-party CRM </h4><br><br>  Thanks to this, the support staff will have more information about each visitor.  If they know about his previous purchases, about his actions, then they can write more personalized messages.  And potential customers love it. <br><br>  Unfortunately, not all chats have the possibility of such integration.  On the functionality of services in more detail at the end of the article. <br><br><h4>  9. Analyze visitors </h4><br><br>  If the service allows you to collect information about the visitor in real time, then when communicating, use this data. <br><br>  <b>Some services allow you to collect data such as:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  location </li><li>  device type (desktop, smartphone or tablet) </li><li>  transition source (advertisement in contextual advertising, link to an article on a third-party resource, post in social networks) </li><li>  time on site </li><li>  current page address </li><li>  search query </li><li>  browser operating system. </li></ul><br><br>  <b>This is enough to form a relevant invitation for the visitor to chat and solve their problem during communication.</b>  For example, if you are a search query by which a person came to the site, then you can help in choosing the right product.  Believe me, a visitor will be surprised if you offer assistance in choosing a product that he Google a minute ago. <br><br><h4>  10. Use a custom greeting and engage in the conversation yourself. </h4><br><br>  If visitors ignore the chat, offer them the actual topic of conversation.  For a person who is looking for a drill in the online store of tools, instead of the standard greeting ‚ÄúHello!  How can I help you? ‚ÄùWrite‚Äú Hello!  Help you choose a powerful and inexpensive drill?  Because the first option does not carry any useful information for a potential client.  While the second option looks much more suitable and attractive. <br><br>  <b>Remember that some people find it difficult to formulate a question.</b>  <b>Therefore, the initiative of a consultant with a specific proposal will be very useful</b> . <br><br>  Each section of the site has its own text of the invitation to the online chat.
