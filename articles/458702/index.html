Yes, right on the very pole - on skis.  In the children's camp ‚ÄúBig Adventure‚Äù in Karelia, where you can go just like that, and the young polar explorers come to prepare for the expedition, 60 sled dogs live.  With these dogs, you can simply live 14 days and go through a large trekking route. <br><br>  A year and a half ago, some of the dogs were transferred to Moscow.  In the north of Sokolniki Park there is a husky park, which is fenced off, and there you can cuddle with Siberian huskies and Chukchi riding ones.  Just walk to the base, pay 400 rubles for a ticket and be among the shaggy dogs.  These are the dogs that are involved in the adventure, just every Muscovite can walk to them.

      And the beauty is that they are safe for humans.  The base breed from which they were taken is just flocks of dogs living near the nomad camps.  Chukchi yarangas stood, and dogs ran around free-range around.  And if at least one of them (any) roars on a child, then she is immediately shot as dangerous. <br><br>  For many generations, the rejection of dogs, aggressive to people, and the selection of the most obedient (for sledding) gave a dog starting to get involved with every person he sees.  But in this case it does not mean that they do not compete with each other. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ik/hv/8l/ikhv8l84ih4iv0ftefeph9pyw_8.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  Who are the riding dogs? </h3><br>  These are animals that have been specially bred in order to transport cargo and people.  Huskies are a breeding breed (specially created), but basic (native) ancestors are not very different in character and appearance.  Huskies, Chukchi sleds, Malamutes and other riding breeds are different options for adapting a dog to transport a sled.  For example, Malamutes are needed to carry heavy loads for short distances.  They are attached to the owner and quite aggressive.  Huskies are smaller but more enduring: the selection went so that they could drag the sledges for a very long time. <br><br>  As I already said, the original breed has become very benevolent towards people due to the selection conditions.  The second property is that there is no binding to a specific owner, because they did not live in ‚Äúman-dog‚Äù pairs, but simply near camps.  Well, different people can lead the team, so there was no reason to form such ties.  That is, in fact, they begin to perceive virtually any new person as an ordinary dog, the owner.  The third property is that they are very good hunters, but they hunt for themselves; people don‚Äôt bring anything.  Because in the summer they are looking for their own food, and in the winter they are fed up with stored frozen fish.  In the nursery, of course, they get food for a whole year from people. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ra/bv/fy/rabvfycsqw9k0llcz2ogiewn9hg.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  What are they doing in the camp? </h3><br>  In April 2006, Matthew Shparo went to the North Pole with Prince Alber II of Monaco.  Then they took dog teams.  After the expedition, the prince presented the first dogs to Matthew, they were left in a camp in Karelia.  Then it turned out that they love to communicate with children and are very useful in children's programs and children's trips.  They began to be bred, purchased, and in 10 years there were about 60 of them. <br><br>  A year and a half ago, in Sokolniki Park, they wanted to open a playground with dogs and offered to bring some of the dogs to Moscow.  Fenced off about a hectare in the forest, made a base, brought 16 dogs.  Now at the base in Sokolniki there are 22 dogs (six puppies were born already here).  For the winter, two more teams are being transferred from Karelia to Sokolniki - 12 dogs, because there are a lot of skating in Moscow, social programs are held for disabled children, and there are obviously more people willing than opportunities from Moscow dogs.  At the base there are both huskies and chukchi sledders. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/70/-c/ba/70-cba3x4ap_xc5tj6v74c2gnfk.jpeg"><br>  <i>Husky</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gg/ja/iq/ggjaiqcpradjfdrwqg7x2opcx-4.jpeg"><br>  <i>Chukot sledovaya.</i> <br><br>  Since 2008, dogs in the camp "Big Adventure" in Karelia began to be used for children's trips, including in the summer.  In general, there are four ways to go somewhere with a sled dog: <br><br><ol><li>  Just walking - like any other breed; </li><li>  To harness from 2 to 12 dogs in a sled (for long crossings usually teams of 6 dogs each: the front ones are smart and know the commands well, the roots of the sled are the strongest and move the sleds when stuck, and in the middle are a couple of not the most experienced); </li><li>  Put the dog in a harness (so that the pressure is not transmitted to the collar, but distributed throughout the body closer to the center of gravity) and fasten the leash to the skier's belt.  Then the dog will pull the skier.  And a skier can shout to her usual teams for a team, by turning her voice to the right-to-left and accelerating-slowing.  Such a team is from one dog. </li><li>  And do the same thing in the summer, just go not on skis, but run.  Children from about 6 years old are already running around confidently with dogs after minimal training: for example, the standard summer program is 2-3 kilometers around the base at Sokolniki with stops.  The main thing is not to forget the commands, otherwise it turns out that not the child controls the dog, but the dog controls the child. </li></ol><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/c_/8w/cu/c_8wcubimkgdbt0el-vmkijklsy.jpeg"><br>  <i>Photo booth: this is the last summer.</i> <br><br>  <a href="https://go.tutu.ru/tury/s-detmi/tour_273/">Here we have on the Tutu Adventures,</a> you can see the 14-day program of the route with dogs. <br><br>  The next important aspect of working with dogs is that they greatly help children to socialize.  They give a lot of kinesthetic development (it is very important for small children to feel something, and here you can squeeze, stroke, and another dog will try to play too).  The only thing is that at this age children are often addicted and try to tear off the dog‚Äôs ear, then simply ‚Äúflirt‚Äù the animal to the ‚Äúleave me alone‚Äù stage, therefore it should be done in the presence of an adult.  For 12 years in the Karelian camp, more than ten thousand children have gone through classes with dogs, and have never bitten anyone and scratched.  Because of the characteristics of the selection, even when she is very unpleasant, she tries to get out and go into the booth.  You can't climb into the booth behind her - this is very strict.  There she is hiding from all the hardships of life. <br><br>  Naturally, dogs are more children, and from joy to drop a child or put paws on his shoulders, which can also scare him.  Therefore, all classes for the youngest are in the presence of a parent and employee base. <br><br>  Another aspect of working with dogs is treatment (Canistherapy).  There are many different uses of dogs for treatment or rehabilitation.  An illustrative case was last year at the base in Sokolniki: a boy with autism spectrum disorder suddenly became very interested in one of the dogs.  Prior to that, he did not speak with anyone: neither with his parents, nor with other children, nor with psychologists.  He was sent to the dogs.  At first he was just playing, and then suddenly he started trying to talk to the dog he liked. <br><br>  But do not think that you can become attached to the healing dog, and all the ailments will pass.  Canistherapy is a versatile method and a long process, with one dog-doctor helping to restore motor functions, with others they replace a psychotherapist.  In Finland, for example, classes with dogs are well established in the practice of speech therapists.  You can lie in a bunch of dogs and treat chronic stress, canistherapy can help with autistic disorders and slow development, dogs can help with problems with motor functions.  Publications - <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed%3FDb%3Dpubmed%26term%3Danimal%2Bassisted%2Btherapy%2Bdog">here</a> .  In Russian there is a book ‚ÄúMedical cynology.  Theoretical approaches and practical implementation.  "Healing" dogs have special training - they, like therapists, are certified.  First - the selection, then - training.  The norm of the dog's work in France is two sessions per day, 1 hour each, then the dogs get tired.  Why get tired?  Because, for example, it is necessary that the child scratched her for 15 minutes in a row.  The dog in this session should stand silently and not hide.  Certified dogs are very patient.  In the same France, there is an occupation when a patient reads a book to a dog, and she listens very attentively and constantly looks at him, does not correct her.  Helps to gain confidence. <br><br><h3>  What you need to know about the team? </h3><br>  Sled dogs live in packs and have a clear hierarchy.  The aboriginal breed simply divided itself into small groups at the camp, and when it was necessary to assemble a team, they simply took part of the group: they got along well.  But with the selection of huskies every year you need to collect the composition of the team again. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gq/ds/zc/gqdszckstnsuea3lt-0gg5tcnkk.jpeg"><br><br>  They love to run with sleds, and at first even ‚Äústranded‚Äù dogs are passionate about passion and joy.  But when they get a little tired, disagreements begin.  Then there are problems with the execution of commands: two dogs made a team, and two more did not, because they are too dominant to do like these two.  In the worst case, a fight can begin.  As a result, the kayur (the man running the harness) should know each dog and put together only the combined ones.  At the beginning of each year, the base musher first test two dogs, then the pairs are assembled in groups of four, and then the teams are assembled into six dogs.  For four teams to work in the park you need 24 dogs, plus a few spare ones.  This process takes place every year anew, because during the year the places in the hierarchy change: dogs are quite aggressive with each other and can sort things out.  Often, young animals become maternal and displace older dogs from dominant positions. <br><br>  They fight often (if allowed).  In the Husky Park, they sit separately (do not reach each other), and walk freely in groups of several dogs so that there are no obvious opponents within the group.  During walks, the level of internal aggression decreases as they disperse over the territory and begin to seek entertainment.  They very nervously react to the horses in Sokolniki: some hide, some try to hunt them.  More foxes come to the base and very rarely moose.  They also sensitively react and scare them. <br><br><h3>  Can I come in today and touch the dogs? </h3><br>  Yes.  The main service of the Husky Park is you can just come and spend an hour with the dogs.  A ticket costs 400 rubles a day off and 300 rubles a weekday.  It is better to call in advance: on weekends there is a tight schedule, and on weekdays you can come almost at any time.  At lunch there are almost no visitors from 12:00 to 16:00 on weekdays, so all dogs will play with you at once.  15‚Äì20 minutes - for the educational part and safety, the rest of the time - just you and the dogs.  The base is open from 10:00 to 18:00 every day except Monday. <br><br>  The second way of entertainment - riding the sleds.  This is mainly in winter, because snow is needed (in summer, sledges can be replaced with a special trolley on wheels).  Possible with musher or independently (after preparation).  On their own - either shortly in a harness from two dogs, or after courses: children who are engaged in riding sports train at the base.  This is a long training program.  The children of the ‚ÄúSchool of Cayurs‚Äù not only ride with the dogs, but also take care of them - they even give them a special massage. <br><br>  Well, you can run around with the dog or walk with it in the winter.  In the summer of running with dogs are very popular.  If you agree in advance, then you can order an animation program for a group of 10 children - this is about an hour-long quest for Sokolniki with orientation and diving from point to point with dogs.  Birthdays are often celebrated this way, because then 15‚Äì20 minutes is spent on a cake and tea in the arctic module. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sp/s1/8l/sps18laqudjrjsnaj7s5kusl1tw.jpeg"><br>  <i>Specifically, this module has never been to the North Pole, but was used in the training of polar children in Karelia.</i>  <i>A small museum of polar equipment is organized here.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dr/zb/b5/drzbb5imehvmluufit-hix-qw-c.jpeg"><br><br>  Team building exercises are done in the same children's groups, which is also important for some activities. <br><br>  Foreign tourists are often brought to the base (in winter) - just a ride in a harness.  But dog experts say: this often happens with them on the first or second day of their arrival in Russia, so Thais, Vietnamese and Chinese simply jump out of the bus into snowdrifts and start taking pictures.  Dogs notice minutes after 20. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yt/tn/fa/yttnfaf-g8deyj_yjv7255svz4g.jpeg"><br>  <i>A place for instruction on safety: "Do not tear the dog's ears!"</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jk/mf/ja/jkmfjanfaokllem7xyqkatlk9hw.jpeg"><br>  <i>For gatherings around the campfire.</i> <br><br><h3>  Normal base life </h3><br>  At the base there are dog handlers, Natalia and Natalia.  One of them is a certified kan therapist, and the second is a veterinarian. <br><br>  Morning begins with feeding, and different dogs get different food and different vitamins.  Because at the base there are one year old puppies and old dogs.  After 10 years, they begin to have an honorable old age, and they need to keep an eye on their joints, so they need special food.  Then they need to be watered.  Then clean up the aviary.  Then the dogs run.  Here in April, they actively molt, they are combed out, so that by the arrival of the guests they do not climb wool.  Then you just need to look, periodically pour water.  Classes begin: dog handlers work individually with each dog.  The basic commands for the team are down here: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/em/10/26/em1026vi3gxsqgwle8xebfvc36c.jpeg"><br><br>  This is the most important thing for the dog.  They do not teach paws and other non-functional teams.  The maximum set, except for these teams of the team or the race, is also ‚Äúwait‚Äù, ‚Äúsit‚Äù, ‚Äúdon't eat‚Äù, ‚Äúeat‚Äù. <br><br>  Here is an example of the problem: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ay/os/tn/ayostnntr2bblshpls6htlzzrtk.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vq/0t/1e/vq0t1eiaahhov4a6m2iksbmynje.jpeg"><br><br>  Further - periodic processing, visits to the veterinary clinic.  There are cycles of obligatory prevention of worms, other parasites, annual vaccinations including rabies, regular cleaning of the ears and cutting of claws. <br><br>  At the base there is a very old dog with a sick spine, it lives separately, because it is contraindicated for it even to hug people for a long time.  In the winter she had a heater, she slept beside him. <br><br>  Puppies born on the base were trained separately.  First - quarantine: from infancy to people it is impossible, because small puppies do not really have immunity.  Then, as they grow up and vaccinate, they gradually become acquainted with dog handlers, then the circle of contacts gradually expands.  They brought employees from the office so that the dogs know that people are different.  Then the puppies began to carry out, show the children, iron.  Step by step, puppies learned that people are different, they smell differently, move differently and in general.  This is important because each human race smells very differently, and tourists from all over the world come to visit the base.  At first puppies are surprised (they can get scared), then they get used to it.  The main thing was to have time to teach this before the World Cup, because so many new people came. <br><br>  Training is also separate.  Usually, young dogs are trained separately from experienced ones: the first classes are conducted together when the young one looks at what needs to be done.  They perfectly repeat for other dogs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/py/uo/dc/pyuodcnhnm3sma9hpe_giaknxke.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  How to prepare for trekking to dogs? </h3><br>  Dress so as not to be afraid to get dirty.  Dogs jump, lick, rub their hair.  It is very important not to take fur things: they hunt for everything fluffy and are very excited when they see fur.  In winter, children came with pompons on their hats, dogs tried to eat them - some instinct also caught them. <br><br>  The first time is usually played with everyone, the second or third time they come to certain dogs. <br><br>  Huskies themselves are very energetic and love people.  When you come to the enclosures with the same guard dogs, dog handlers often keep behind you the shoulder or the balls that the dogs play during training, so they start to watch the toys carefully.  And people think that they are paying attention to them.  You don't need anything like that with the Huskies: they immediately run up to play with you.  True, not all: someone is in a bad mood, someone loves silence, someone is tired after a workout, but 18‚Äì19 out of 22 dogs are usually willing to communicate. <br><br>  Another interesting case: the parents brought a boy about 5 years old, who was afraid of dogs.  Started with the most calm.  They taught you how to iron properly, so as not to pull the wool.  How to approach, stretch a hand and do not move, so that it sniffed and met.  They said that the child began to concentrate more attention, it is better to interact with parents.  There was an adult who overcame children's fear of dogs, but it took more time. <br><br>  It is best to comb their croup (back of the back), neck, face closer to the forehead.  Some of the friendliest people put their stomachs up: this is a sign of trust, you have to be very careful.  There are dogs that are constantly trying to substitute croup, so when trying to take pictures, they are obtained without a ‚Äúface‚Äù.  And there are those who understand the game with a camera and look into the lens. <br><br>  That's all I wanted to tell you about sled dogs.  With us were the head of the base, Vladimir Rodionov: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xy/sk/rc/xyskrcxdyiarfwxdhhe5ugjazis.jpeg"><br><br>  Canine therapist, Kanis therapist and instructor of youth tourism Natalya Akimova: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qt/2j/-b/qt2j-b9vxpuypp00h7fi5ko-xws.jpeg"><br><br>  And the veterinarian cynologist Natalya Kosenko: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gf/3o/jv/gf3ojvk1mtbw-y8rofcyu164y4g.jpeg"><br><br>  And, of course, the dog base: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jt/i4/k8/jti4k8wp957qnzfvb_rdscr50zi.jpeg"><br><br>  Base site - <a href="http://husky-sokolniki.ru/">here</a> , Address: 5th Luchevaya prosek, vl.  16-A, telephone 8 (901) 725-93-56. <br><br>  Great adventures (multi-day) in the <a href="https://pro-camp.ru/">camps of Shparo</a> and with dogs <a href="https://go.tutu.ru/user/shparo_239/">here</a> : you can choose a wellness program for your child for the summer.
