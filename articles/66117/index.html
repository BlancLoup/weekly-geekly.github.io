  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Exploring ASP.NET + ADO.NET + Silverlight</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Most recently, I started working on a single project that involves creating a web service with a user-friendly graphical interface.  At that time, I had only enough basic knowledge of the C # language and skills in developing Windows applications on .NET technologies.  That is why I decided then to build web applications on <b>ASP.NET, ADO.NET</b> technologies (the service assumes active interaction with the database) and <b>Silverlight.</b> <br>  It took only a few weeks, and the service is ready more than half.  I can not say that I know everything about the above technologies, but quite enough :) Actually my topic now is a story about how, in my opinion, it is necessary to learn these technologies and what to read.  In fact, I wrote something that I really missed in my time - practically a plan of action.  I do not pretend to be a professional in these industries, I just would like to give some advice to beginners and just beginners.  So, let's begin. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="http://www.asp.net/App_Themes/Standard/i/logo.png" alt="image"><br>  <b>ASP.NET</b> <br>  In my opinion, having knowledge of C # and basic skills in developing .NET applications, it is already possible to start developing the simplest ASP.NET applications, since Visual Studio offers a lot of tools, which are not difficult to deal with.  Although, of course, for more complex applications, you must read the textbooks.  In my case, this was <i>‚ÄúMicrosoft ASP.NET 2.0 with examples in C # 2005 for professionals‚Äù by</i> authors Matthew MacDonald and Mario Shpushta (I am absolutely sure that a newer version of the textbook is available).  In my opinion, there are well indicated basic knowledge, as well as (in my case) things related to authorization and authentication.  To create an ASP.NET site, I had more than enough knowledge. <br><br><img src="http://www.specialist.ru/Images/Flash/NET/ADO.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <b>ADO.NET</b> <br>  Strangely enough, but in the textbook ‚ÄúMicrosoft ASp.NET 2.0 with examples in C # 2005 for professionals‚Äù the technology of access to the database was also well described: first, the question of connection ( <i>SQL Connection, SQL Adapter, SQL Command</i> ), and then DataSet, which is quite logical in terms of the order of study.  Also useful was the Troelsen tutorial, ‚ÄúC # and the .Net platform,‚Äù in which the order of learning was reversed with the exact opposite, but the technology was examined a little deeper.  In general, both tutorials are good enough if you want to develop a standard connection.  You will need to dig deeper (for example, connecting using an OleDB adapter) - read Troelsen. <br><br><img src="http://www.conceptdevelopment.net/Silverlight/Blend04b/silverlight.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <b>Silverlight</b> <br>  Due to the fact that students can get a lot of software from Maykrasoft for free on Dreamspark, I downloaded the second version of Expression Studio and did not dive into the innovations of the third version.  With Silverlight, things were not as simple as with previous technologies.  The first book was the introduction to Microsoft Silverlight 2 by Mayrokrovtovskaya by author Lawrence Moroni (in my opinion, the book is available for free, but without it you can easily download it on torrents).  The basic aspects of the technology, work in Expression Blend and Visual Studio were well described there, but the main disadvantage of this book, in my opinion, is the presence of many unnecessary for a basic level of knowledge (for example, integration with JavaScript, working in PHP and Java) and the lack of other useful things (for example, SOAP service). <br>  Therefore, I advise you to also watch all the videos on <a href="http://techdays.ru/">techdays</a> : a <a href="http://www.techdays.ru/Category.aspx%3FTag%3DSilverlight">page with videos about Silverlight</a> .  (Mikhail Chernomordnikov and Sergey Pugachev, if you are reading this, thank you for your reports, they helped a lot). <br>  In addition, if you are going to use server-side capabilities in your Silverlight application (for example, working with a database or authorization), you need to create a SOAP or REST service through which to interact with the server (and Silverlight, as you know, is executed on the client side ).  I got a lot of information (and most importantly practical) in <a href="http://www.techdays.ru/videos/1313.html">Vitaly Dilmukhametov's report on techdays</a> , which I advise you)

      And the last.  If you have questions, the answers to which you can not find either in textbooks or googling, do not hesitate to contact the developers on the <a href="http://msdn.com/">MSDN'a</a> and <a href="http://asp.net/">ASP.net</a> forums, and for bad-learning English - on <a href="http://rsdn.ru/">the RSDN forum</a> and <a href="http://silverlighter.ru/">Silverlitera</a> site.  I know from my own experience: they answer very quickly and even to very very noob questions :) <br><br>  Thank you for your attention, I hope this will be useful to you.  If you have any questions, comments or any feedback, I will be glad to answer or listen in the comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/66117/">https://habr.com/ru/post/66117/</a></p>
