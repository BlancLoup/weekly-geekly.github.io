  <section class="page js-page"><h1>HTC Desire Z: phone, keyboard, root access</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It so happened that yesterday I became the owner of HTC Desire Z purchased in the UK, and for about a day we have been overwhelmed with the desire to share this good news with all Habrawers with this joy.  In fact, of course, I wanted to talk about the process of adapting the phone to my realities.  There have already been several reviews, but in my opinion, the experience of practical application is lacking. <br>  We'll start with importing the settings, continue the experience with existing applications and install new ones, touch on energy saving and complete the device rutting (optionally, of course).  At the same time, the note has no independent value and is compiled from several sources on the Internet.  Interesting? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Reading manuals </h3><br>  Parting words from HTC: It is not recommended to charge the phone via USB if it is very discharged.  If you, like me, bought a phone in Britain, buy yourself a MicroUSB battery charger from the network, for example, made by Samsung or Nokia (the original Samsung charger is about 500 rubles in Euroset, there are probably cheaper options).  Also, in order to avoid incidents, HTC recommends connecting the phone only to grounded computers.  And yet, I was surprised by the process of preparing the phone for work.  To turn on the phone, not enough to press the power button.  It is necessary to open the battery cover, remove the battery and remove the insulating film from it.  Then we put the SIM card and battery there, and the phone is ready for use (the battery is less than half charged).  I didn‚Äôt find anything valuable in the manual. <br><br><h3>  Initial setup </h3><br>  The first thing that I was offered the phone after switching on is the import of contacts and everything that happens - from the previous phone.  For this menu item a special thank you HTC!  From my SonyEricsson Vivaz, I managed to import only contacts.  However, thanks to that: I still had important SMS messages on the SIM card. <br>  The next step was setting up the Internet.  I indicated to the master that I only have a Wi-Fi connection (at home, unlimited, yes).  3G / EDGE on the phone I turn on only manually (on the phone, the traffic is not unlimited, but only 60 MB of prepaid per month).  So, in order not to get money, it seems to make sense to point out that there is no Internet connection over the cellular network.  However, I am thinking about connecting an unlimited Internet - I have this option for 90 rubles per month. <br>  Another important point is to register on HTCSense.com.  This does not give special advantages (well, I don‚Äôt believe that I can return a stolen phone with it, or even remove my data from it), but the ability to search for a phone in my apartment via the Internet is positive.  No more searching for your favorite phone to call yourself to find your phone. <br>  Geolocation settings: to taste.  I have everything included.  By the way, geolocation in our city leaves much to be desired (1-2 km accuracy). <br><br><h3>  Applications </h3><br>  Surprisingly, all applications from the phone perform their function "with a bang."  Work and social applications, and voice typing.  I even liked the Russian software keyboard.  But the hardware keyboard did not want to work with the Russian under any sauce.  I came to the aid of a Russian keyboard, available on the Android Market: search by the word " <strong>Russian Keyboard</strong> ", the author of <strong>GameWarrior</strong> .  By activating the ‚ÄúRussian Keyboard‚Äù input method in any of the controls, we get a transliterating hardware keyboard.  Some "secrets": <br><ul><li>  sh: sh </li><li>  u: w </li><li>  l: q </li><li>  : qq </li><li>  y: yu or uu </li><li>  yy: uyu </li></ul><br>  I thought it would be inconvenient: but no, in just a few minutes my hands got used to translit and I no longer feel the urgent need to engrave and look for ways to improve the performance of the hardware keyboard with Russian letters. <br>  In addition to the Russian Keyboard, I installed <strong>Android Terminal Emulator</strong> to work with the phone itself, as well as <strong>ConnectBot</strong> for working with remote servers (ssh).  The <strong>Dolphin Browser ‚Ñ¢ HD2</strong> browser, <strong>Alarm Clock PlusV2</strong> alarm clock, <strong>Evernote</strong> clipper, <strong>YouTube</strong> app (here it was on Symbian was more useful), <strong>ES File Explorer</strong> file manager and several games complements the picture. <br>  Those interested can Russify the interface of the British phone by installing the program MoreLocale 2 from the Android Market (thanks to <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/daemoni/" class="user_link">DaemonI</a> for the idea).

    <h3>  About energy saving </h3><br>  As usual, the consumption of electricity depends on the appetites of users.  For me, with the current appetites, the battery will last for a little more than a day, but who needs it?  I hope in time to reach two days (as I finish all the experiments with the phone).  So, the layout from the last charge is as follows: After 21 hours and 6 minutes of work, 18% of the battery remains (I set up the phone to switch to power saving mode at the level of 20%).  Most of the electricity was ‚Äúeaten up‚Äù by a rather rather small screen (69%), then 12% was spent on voice calls.  Now the phone is charging and there are already completely different numbers (see this: Settings ‚áí About Phone ‚áí Battery ‚áí Battery Use).  Based on my power consumption, I decided to try to turn off the adaptive display brightness (30% is enough for me).  Calls today was about 10-15 minutes.  On the Internet, they write that overclocking the processor does not harm power consumption, so I'll do it anyway.  The only thing that confuses: the phone is now getting warm under load, slightly afraid of overheating. <br><br><h3>  Hello root </h3><br>  As an old Linux user, I could not avoid getting root-rights on the phone.  And although I need a phone in order to make calls, work and play (and Android 2.2 allows me to do all this comfortably), getting root privileges there is just a matter of principle!  I'm sure the user should <strong>be able</strong> to do any horrible things with the phone.  For example, I can drown the phone in the toilet or bathroom, making it unusable.  I can also ruin the phone with unsuccessful firmware.  But for some reason, the manufacturer allows me to take the first action, but he is trying to shield me from the second.  Well, I do not! <br>  So!  <strong>DANGER</strong> !  Theoretically, this operation <strong>can turn your phone for 20 thousand rubles into a brick worth a couple of hundred</strong> .  I got my phone and everything went fine, but just in case, remember the good old saying <em>‚ÄúMeasure seven times - cut one‚Äù</em> .  The method was not invented by me, I just translated the article from the English-language wonderful forum. <br>  The XDA-Developers forum has a <a title="Easy permanent root for HTC Desire Z" href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php%3Ft%3D835777">description of getting root access on HTC Desire Z for dummies</a> .  We will use it.  In particular, you need to download the file from the first post (registration is required for downloading).  This will be item number 0.  Well, or if you do not want to register, and at the same time trust me, you can <a title="Download VISIONary + from baron.su" href="">download it without registering with my blog</a> . <br>  Next, you need to allow the installation of programs not from the Android Market, and prepare the phone for rooting.  To do this, go to Settings ‚áí Applications, set the checkbox <strong>Unknown Sources</strong> , remove the checkbox <strong>Fast Boot</strong> .  Go to the Development submenu, set the <strong>USB Debugging checkbox</strong> . <br>  Everything is ready, using the ES File Explorer, Astro or any other file manager, we launch the installation of the VISIONary + package we downloaded in step 0.  Then run it from the list of all applications. <br>  Hacking process: click ‚ÄúTempRoot now‚Äù, wait a minute.  Click ‚ÄúAttempt PermRoot Now!‚Äù, We agree to give the program superuser rights.  I, however, got an error - I had to perform TempRoot again.  After performing PermRoot, the phone goes into a long reboot (remember, you turned off FastBoot?). <br>  And finally, a few questions and answers from the XDA Developers forum. <br><ol><li>  <em>Is the process reversible?</em> <br><br>  Yes, the process is reversible.  VISIONary + can do and un-root.  Just run the program again and do ‚ÄúUnroot now!‚Äù </li><li>  <em>Does the routing delete any data from the phone or from the memory card?</em> <br>  No, it only changes the permissions. </li><li>  <em>Do I lose my warranty by charging my phone?</em> <br>  Complex issue.  But, in general, you can just return everything as it was. </li><li>  <em>After the completion of the rooting process, is it possible to uninstall VISIONary +?</em> <br>  Yes, you can uninstall.  Root rights will remain. </li></ol><br><br><h3>  I have an opinion </h3><br>  For two days in the phone I was disappointed.  Yes, heavy.  Yes, it does not work for so long without connecting to the mains.  Yes, the hardware keyboard is working only through translit, not yyuken.  But it is not so important for me.  The phone works quickly, it lies perfectly in the hand, it also feels great.  GPS is better than in SE Vivaz (but I do not need it, I do not drive a car and live in a small town, I go to large cities 1-2 times a year).  The text on the hardware keyboard is typed quickly (even Russian through transliteration), it is especially pleasant to work in ssh.  In short, I do not regret the purchase. <br><br><h3>  The following materials were used: </h3><ul><li>  <a title="Easy permanent root for HTC Desire Z" href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php%3Ft%3D835777">Describing the Desire Z root process from the xda-developers forum</a> </li><li>  <a title="ruKeyboard for Android" href="http://androidteam.ru/soft/tools/rukeyboard.html">Homepage ruKeyboard</a> , <a title="ruKeyboard on the forum AndroidTeam.RU" href="http://androidteam.ru/forum/showthread.php%3Ft%3D320">discussion ruKeyboard on the forum</a> . </li><li>  Daimon <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/daemoni/" class="user_link">Habrayumer Comment</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/108239/">https://habr.com/ru/post/108239/</a></p>
