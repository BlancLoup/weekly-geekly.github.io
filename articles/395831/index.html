  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Reflections on the "Spring Package" and ways to control uncontrolled</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p>  Passions have sort of subsided, and the inevitability has become obvious - probably it will not work out.  Let us then think about what kind of human rights measures there is an opportunity to demand. </p><br><p>  I will try to draw an analogy.  In Russia, gambling is prohibited for most of it.  Result: the business has not gone away, and the security services are holding monopolists, arranging masks shows to all competitors for 2-3 days after opening.  One could screw up Putin‚Äôs ‚Äúcunning plan‚Äù on the hidden replenishment of the defense and intelligence budget, but it is highly doubtful. </p><br><p>  For comparison, in the countries that survived the puritanical period, the complexities of quasi-taboo are tightly regulated.  As a result, taxes are paid, the spread of sexually transmitted diseases is restrained, the state monitors the percentage of casino profitability, the casino is obliged to restrict access to gamers, etc. </p><br><p>  <strong>If something is inevitable, then the question of public control of this inevitable should be raised.</strong> </p><br><h2>  Concerns have arisen </h2><br><ol><li>  Violation of the secrets of personal correspondence and conversations. </li><li>  Violation of trade secrets for the purpose of unfair competition. </li><li>  Load on operators and tariff increases. </li></ol><br><h2>  How to solve these issues in one fell swoop </h2><a name="habracut"></a><br><p>  I invite the respected community to think and bring to mind the following suggestions for the further collection of signatures for consideration at the federal level: </p><br><ul><li>  The state is obliged to provide a single ready-made hardware and software solution for all operators free of charge. <br><ul><li>  The actions of the norms of the ‚ÄúSpring package‚Äù should be postponed until this requirement is met and at least 3 equipment manufacturers appear. </li><li>  Directly the purchase of equipment still falls on the shoulders of operators. </li><li>  All auxiliary means fall under this requirement. </li></ul></li><li>  The program part should be unified and developed and maintained at the expense of the state with the possibility of citizen participation. </li><li>  Both software and hardware must be 100% open to public scrutiny.  Those.  Neither x86 nor Elbrus can get into this list. </li><li>  Each software update must be digitally signed by the following authorities: <br><ul><li>  FSB, </li><li>  An autonomous NPO is a public platform where every citizen can make a valid claim for blocking, </li><li>  The ombudsman under the President of the Russian Federation - only after the signature from the NPO, </li><li>  Court of III instance and above - signed last. </li><li>  The law should protect private key holders from the need to provide it upon request. </li></ul></li><li>  The hardware must have a clear GOST and certification procedure that is accessible to everyone with a legal ceiling for payment (up to 1 million rubles). <br><ul><li>  GOST must be approved by all those persons. </li></ul></li><li>  All data must be stored in encrypted form without the possibility of obtaining them even with an unauthorized autopsy. </li><li>  Any access to stored data must be fully recorded. <br><ul><li>  There should be full details of access to specific data. </li><li>  There should be several different types of access with public key infrastructure: <br><ul><li>  For security officials and prosecutors - only reading data and auditing access, removing the mode of secrecy, </li><li>  For judges of the II instance and above - only reading of the access audit and the ability to enter the mode of time secrecy of access, </li><li>  For technical staff - only the ability to install signed updates, network settings and removable equipment, </li><li>  To sign the software: only the signature of the finished binary artifacts. </li></ul></li></ul></li><li>  Every citizen and organization should receive a report on the use of this data once a month, even if such cases are not recorded (proof of lack of access). <br><ul><li>  For cases of long-term surveillance, to allow the interception of the wiretap by the court of II instance and above.  Directly the judge himself must execute such a decision without delegation to a third party. <br><ul><li>  Privacy policy should be updated every three months. </li><li>  The secrecy regime should be immediately removed at the conclusion of the investigation. </li></ul></li><li>  When removing privacy, a full report on access must be provided during the period of secrecy. </li></ul></li><li>  Criminalize unauthorized or unjustified access to data: <br><ul><li>  Full immunity withdrawal in the case if available, </li><li>  From 3 to 5 years conditionally without the right to hold the relevant position, plus a fine, </li><li>  If minors suffered from 3 to 5 years with a real sentence, </li><li>  If the violation of a trade secret has economic consequences, from 3 to 5 years with a real term of punishment, damages and confiscation of property. </li></ul></li><li>  Criminalize the theft, seizure or use of someone else's digital signature keys, as well as add bookmarks for unauthorized access or exploit vulnerabilities: <br><ul><li>  Equate to the article treason. </li></ul></li></ul></div>
