In a new way.  Architects worked hard over the atmosphere in the city.  In many ways, it is unusual structures that are considered an integral source of inspiration for its citizens.  We decided to share this feeling with everyone who has never been with us before.  And who lives and studies here, probably, did not even suspect what inspired the architects themselves to create such solutions. <br><br>  Attention, under the cut a lot of impressive photos. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Innopolis</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ee9/298/2a1/ee92982a11cd467ebbda9aa4fee92f08.jpg" alt="image">

      What is the best thing in Innopolis?  The first thing that comes is functionality and proximity to nature.  In modern architecture, originality is appreciated.  But often it is put at the expense of the landscape, culture or local traditions.  In Innopolis, it was possible to create a community aimed at connecting with nature.  And while the city remained attractive for living.  This link harmoniously managed to transfer Singaporean architect Tai Liu Keru.  In developing the master plan of the city, he took into account the features of the area.  A special approach to design is dictated by the site itself - the surrounding rocky shores, the Volga and Sviyaga rivers, forests and mountains.  The implementation of his master plan was entrusted to Russian specialists.  The exterior of the buildings and the improvement of the new territory was the responsibility of the company from Kazan - Innopolis Architect.  At first, the architects themselves did not fully believe that all futuristic ideas would be translated into reality.  But in the end, their work turned out to be not just a concept in the form of a layout, but a fully accomplished city. <br><br>  <b>Innopolis University</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Architects - Anton Tsybisov, Yana Samakayeva</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/770/c19/aa4/770c19aa428a4ac592705a30536c0368.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The first association that occurs when a university is seen is a spacecraft.  Of course, now it is difficult to surprise someone with glass facades.  But the architect got rid of the monotony due to the game with reliefs.  The building seems to be bent - the wavy lines either grow or disappear.  Which ultimately doesn't exactly look boring.  Smooth lines imitate the natural landscape and repeat the terrain reliefs.  The system of consoles elevates the university.  It seems that his entire massive volume soars above the ground. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5d0/415/7af/5d04157afc4f4c9aa87058a62e14c3fe.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/049/3e6/91b/0493e691b40c4ad4a9ce7c157025bb7d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  If you study in the most modern university, where advanced professors from all over the world share their knowledge and experience, then the situation should have to be constantly improved.  Inside the building there is a lot of light and space.  This is one big atrium.  The interior situation consists of junctions, which are the main ‚Äútransport arteries‚Äù.  The air-conditioned meeting rooms are fascinating.  And it was not by chance that architects chose green and white color schemes.  Unity with nature can be traced throughout the concept of the city of Innopolis. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5b4/116/954/5b411695483b4e4583f0bf06b6f2229f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Rational planning of the building allowed to place here both a university and a secondary school, which was opened on September 1.  In this case, neither students nor schoolchildren do not interfere in the learning process of each other.  Now 40 children attend school.  They study in such small classes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/885/feb/a41/885feba41dab4c52a5d8fab0805d98ac.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The task of the architects was to create a special environment where teachers and students could interact as comfortably as possible.  Therefore, it is not surprising if, at a lecture, a student allows himself to sit on a huge pouf with a laptop.  Indeed, besides the usual audiences and classes, there is an open lecture hall, where there are no usual desks.  Instead, soft ottomans. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fbc/162/77e/fbc16277eede4bd2b680d1a0b8dee5c8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/954/633/3ff/9546333fff604552a86257129578db1e.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  When you go to the library, as if you are in a separate building.  The architects have kept the same materials and colors here, but the atmosphere gives the impression of a completely different reality.  The library and reading room occupy 3 floors.  The spiral staircase atrium is their heart. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d52/e7d/ac2/d52e7dac2c6043738c95511c663cbbed.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  A nice bonus for all those who sometimes need peace and quiet - closed work areas, from which you can simply create an ideal introvert corner. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f6c/928/18c/f6c92818c2934058af3b6229c402a7ac.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  University students are incredibly lucky.  Even in the most cloudy weather they do not have to go out.  Directly from the university building, they can get into their dormitory by special transitions.  One tunnel connects the building with 4 student campuses. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/919/d79/14b/919d7914b3cb44f192ba2f2a82769cbc.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/96b/349/4cc/96b3494cc618498e9246fb6d3139e011.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Student campus</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Architects - Timur Stepanov, Mikhail Kapitonov</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/73a/40a/044/73a40a0441fc435c8d1314e0085f7beb.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The composition of the campus continue to the hostel.  On their facades, as in the design of the university, a plastic game is used.  For cladding used rock panels, imitating wood of different shades, from which came the mosaic.  The panels themselves are heat-proof, they are made of stone wool and have a high level of fire resistance. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d29/201/849/d292018492b24494962c0695b77113fe.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  At the entrance to the hostel is located atrium.  He seems to be cutting through the inner space, so that a lot of light appears inside. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/24d/a9a/35a/24da9a35ad8547809edb2eef19f85ceb.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Accommodation is just a dream for any student.  The rooms have everything you need - new furniture, kitchen, bathroom and even air conditioning.  Conditions are consistent with the hotels of the level of ‚Äú3 stars‚Äù.  And weekly the rooms are cleaned by a cleaning company.  Two types of rooms are available - designed for 2 people and 5 people. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ed6/01a/985/ed601a98553b470aaf6da6bcf3f1c405.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/48a/616/71c/48a61671c7ab4caab96d22e50431374a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Sports complex</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Architect - Timur Stepanov</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f42/574/a96/f42574a9689c40f681b024aa55f42d14.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  Perhaps the most mysterious building in Innopolis is a sports complex.  It perfectly reflects the specifics of the city - high technology.  <b>The architect took the principle of mathematical logic as the basis.</b>  <b>According to the linear equation, the size of the windows decreases from the center of the facade to the edges of the building.</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/744/974/3cc/7449743cc5474876acb33a9f05022b2c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And inside - a modern sports center.  With a swimming pool, sauna complex, gym and cardio rooms, as well as a room for team sports. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6c5/18c/88f/6c518c88f9bb4e3c9ea2a0cffde944a8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b33/ef5/908/b33ef59083874beb81804a4576d84069.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Technopark of the special economic zone "Innopolis" named after A. Popov</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Architect - Anton Tsybisov</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/366/bd9/895/366bd9895a5d4e938dc8105ebd204f54.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Judging by the posts in Instagram, corps them.  A.S.  Popova - Innopolis most "star" object.  The expressive architectural creation has the form of a ring, inside of which in the summer you can observe comfortable lawns and flower beds.  The entire filling of the building - from the facade to the interior inside the building - everything interacts with each other and reflects the very system of nature. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f5b/d3a/cdb/f5bd3acdb07148ba96c3b6542bda67b8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Technopark has a round shape.  The architects have foreseen the moment that in such a building it is easy to get lost and made comfortable navigation.  Conventionally, the technopark is divided into three different zones, which symbolize stone, wood and greenery.  And of course, each zone is illustrated with motifs and materials of organic elements. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/476/757/b3b/476757b3bc5f4834a8c3db420699ff30.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Residential complex</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Architects - Timur Stepanov, Mikhail Kapitonov</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bcf/ac0/382/bcfac038270149308942503960a253cb.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The artistic idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa residential complex is to create a natural ensemble, the elements of which are not similar to each other.  Indeed, in nature everything is unique and there is no place for repetitions.  It is not by chance that buildings have bright green, white and wood coloring.  If you look closely at the facades of residential buildings, you can see the similarities with the binary code.  It was digital technologies that inspired architects when designing residential buildings in the city of the future. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fe5/eff/b73/fe5effb73c3149edb0394402af8d73f0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The residential complex was built on the principle of closed courtyards with multifunctional playgrounds and a ban on parking.  The headache of large cities with a lack of parking spaces here is solved by the presence of underground parking. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e37/917/a4b/e37917a4b303418480713a98fb51f533.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In Innopolis built 16 houses, 4 of which have already been inhabited.  Apartments are rented completely ready for living with all necessary appliances and furniture.  It is enough to get the keys and you can drive in, and the key can be either a fingerprint or a SKUD-key, or a familiar piece of metal. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/547/933/dd9/547933dd9f184b968ecda0fd7f365cc4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b63/88d/8a1/b6388d8a1f8e4229937ed9b031afab73.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In Innopolis, you can feel the delights of country life, while being within the city limits.  Residents are offered three types of townhouses - with a separate entrance, parking space and land. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/778/2b4/92e/7782b492e76a4fe2bdf128df61b7739a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  PS With care about ecology <br><br>  In an innovative city, everything must be innovative.  And even transport.  Soon, an electric bus will start driving through the city streets.  Instead of fuel tanks, it is equipped with a powerful electric accumulator.  As well as in general electric cars in Innopolis are not uncommon.  In the city, you can rent an electric car karsheringovogo service myCars at a rate of 6 rubles per minute.  But we will tell about it in the next post. <br><br>  <b>Welcome to Innopolis!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/273783/">https://habr.com/ru/post/273783/</a></p>
