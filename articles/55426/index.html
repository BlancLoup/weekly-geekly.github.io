  <section class="page js-page"><h1>School education reform. Utopia. Start.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Inspired by several articles on the school theme ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/i_am_clever/55404/">1</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/the_future_is_here/55307/">2</a> ), or rather comments on them. <br><br>  It is no secret that the level of education in our (and not only) country falls from year to year.  There are suggestions that this is largely due to the fact that the school is forced to ‚Äúlosers‚Äù, respectively, it has to slow down ‚Äúhonors‚Äù.  And if the number of ‚ÄúLosers‚Äù reaches a certain critical threshold, then the rest of the mass of students very quickly slips to their level.  Learning is not prestigious, and bydlovat - fashionable. <br><br>  My proposal is very simple and far from new - to divide our entire education into several stages.  Actually the way it is now.  But I also propose to return another remarkable thing from non-existence, namely, to lower the threshold of compulsory education from 9 (and now they are offering 11 classes) to 5 classes.  As well as the transition to a new level of education to accompany the entrance exams (even if it will be the notorious USE).  In all steps, higher than the initial, cancel the remaining for the second year, but actively use the failure rate.  Re-entry to school - through exams. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  A person, having received a primary education, will be able to read, count and write without problems, he will have some idea about the structure of the surrounding world.  Very many of this is enough to live and work quite successfully.  My great-grandfather had education in five classes, he was a very wise and respected man, the foreman of the road builders.

      All other steps are only for those who really want to achieve something more in life.  Understand this themselves.  Understand their parents. <br><br>  Why do you need it? <br>  To weed out of school children who are unwilling or unable to learn. <br>  To motivate children and, last but not least, their parents take their studies seriously. <br><br>  Here is my proposal in summary. <br><br>  A small addition to add clarity: <br>  Having received a primary education, the child should become, if not a full member of society, then at least get the official right to work.  And in 14 years to get the full rights and obligations of a citizen of the country. <br><br>  Another addition: <br>  So that the elementary graduate has options for further development (except for unskilled work), I suggest giving them the opportunity to attend special courses for the profession.  Actually, all this is already there.  The only thing you need is to lower the age threshold from 15 to 12 years. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/55426/">https://habr.com/ru/post/55426/</a></p>
