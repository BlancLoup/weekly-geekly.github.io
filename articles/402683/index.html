  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Some additions for 3d printer Anet A8</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  3D printer Anet A8 - one of the cheapest models of printers from China.  It was built on the basis of the well-known model Prusa i3.  For the price for which it is offered by manufacturers, you are unlikely to buy a printer in Russia.  Of the advantages we can note a small cost, a large enough maximum size of the model and, most importantly, a heated table.  There are already a lot of reviews on this printer, so I‚Äôll write a small list of improvements, thanks to which your printer will print better or improve its cosmetic appearance. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The first improvement is unlikely to help the printer somehow, but it may be more convenient for you to follow the printing process.  By attaching the LED panel to the top beam of the printer, you get a fully illuminated table, which is very convenient to observe the print.  And since the power supply on the printer at 12v, then connect the tape is not difficult. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/12d/11c/6ac/12d11c6ac3ae4060a24816a4eaa088ce.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Now advice for those who often prints with ABS plastic and any other that requires a high temperature for heating the table (more than 90 degrees).  With this heating of the table, a lot of electricity is consumed, so that the upper part of the power supply unit is very hot.  Solving this problem is not as difficult as it seems at first.  You just need to put the cooler from the computer on the side of the unit to blow.  It is best to take a cooler with a blade diameter of 80 mm.  So there will be enough air flow to cool the internal circuits.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ebb/46b/a3b/ebb46ba3b2c34db3bd2c29bc1c154caf.png" alt="image"><br><br>  We now turn to additional details that we ourselves can print on our printer. <br><br>  1) The quality of the model strongly depends on the availability of plastic cooling immediately after leaving the extruder.  Unfortunately, the standard form of the cooling nozzle does not do its job well.  The site thingiverse.com has many different nozzle models, but I think one of the most optimal nozzle models is in the shape of a semicircle.  So how exactly does it provide uniform airflow model.  The round does not cope with its purpose because of the low power of the fan. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1954001">Model</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/937/501/b36/937501b36ac54cb99275cec17fc9eac5.png" alt="image"><br><br>  2) Plastic supplied to the extruder without problems is the key to good printing.  Therefore it is worth serving it vertically.  To do this, there are two models of guides for plastic.  One is mounted on the printer on top, the second - on the carriage. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1764285">1st model</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1795148">2nd model</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/176/f2b/801/176f2b80110441f3950ce53b53d39469.png" alt="image"><br><br>  3) If the carriage direction changes abruptly, waves may form on the model.  This is due to the wobbly frame.  This problem can be solved by connecting the frame with additional corners.  They will make it less shaky. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1672959">Model</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bf7/073/74a/bf707374a96c4722b1861004df1807c2.png" alt="image"><br><br>  4) In order for the printer table to stand exactly, the following model will help.  She helped me to solve such a problem that one of the axes of the table was tilted.  Possible error during assembly.  But as soon as I put this part, the problem immediately disappeared. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1857991">Model</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/346/c29/406/346c29406faa4ec485cc1e4f611d23a4.png" alt="image"><br><br>  5) The next tip is for those who want to tighten the printer's belts, but do not want to re-tighten them.  You have 2 options: buy or print tensioners.  If you are going to buy them, here are the photos: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e7c/6f5/922/e7c6f5922f6149618df27c9b6e9c1121.png" alt="image"><br><br>  And if you are going to print them, then here are the links: <br><br>  <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1683070">Tensioner for X axis</a> and <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1683085">for Y axis</a> .  I will not say anything about their quality, I bought springs in China and I am satisfied with the quality.  There is no photo, because I did not print it, and there are other photos on the page with the model. <br><br>  <a href="https://pevly.com/anet-a8-upgrades/">Some information taken from this site.</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/402683/">https://habr.com/ru/post/402683/</a></p>
