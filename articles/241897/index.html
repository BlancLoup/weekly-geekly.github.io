By the end of 2014, the market volume will reach $ 25 billion, and in 2015 - $ 30 billion. <br><br>  Analysts predict further growth in the mobile market due to new emerging markets.  And the greatest bet is made on the countries of Asia and South America, where the penetration of smartphones is far from the saturation border (if we also take into account that China, India, Brazil are among these countries).

      Ahead of the PC market and consoles, including the fact that the mobile market aggregates part of the audience, which had previously been a supporter of these platforms.  Since Nintendo's revenues for 2013 amounted to $ 2.4 billion, a decline is projected this year, while revenues from games on the App Store and Google Play will be $ 4 and $ 3 billion, respectively. <br><br>  Newzoo predicts that by 2017 the mobile market will grow to almost $ 41 billion, and among the ‚Äúfour screens‚Äù (PC, TV, Mobile, Tablet) mobile phones and tablets will receive more than half of all revenue from the user. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Amazon Fire is almost officially recognized as a failure. </h4><br>  Recall that the main feature of this device is the Dynamic Perspective function, which creates a 3D illusion of what is happening on the screen. <br><br>  For the current day, Amazon Fire Phone costs $ 1.  But, however, with the condition of purchase, along with a two-year contract with AT &amp; T.  When it was launched a few months ago, it cost $ 199.  If the price of $ 1 was at the launch of the device in July, then perhaps this would not have happened. <br><br>  Although Amazon did not publicly declare anything, but there is <a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/10/fire-phone-a-failure/">information</a> that Fire Phone worth $ 83 million is stuck in warehouses and shops now. And the chance to realize so many devices tends to zero every day.  And the loss for the 3rd quarter is $ 170 million. <br><br>  Another attempt by Amazon to take a firm position in the mobile market has failed.  So when you think about whether to go to the Amazon Store, consider your costs for the version and the amount of money and users who are there now.  Explosive growth of these indicators in the near future is not expected. <br><br><br><h4>  Opera reported on the mobile advertising market for the 3rd quarter of 2014 </h4><br>  According to the new <a href="http://apptractor.ru/marketing-monetization/ad-networks/opera-mediaworks-sostoyanie-mobilnoy-reklamyi-3-kvartal-2014.html">report</a> from Opera, Android continues to slowly but surely push iOS in the mobile advertising market.  The share of iOS revenue fell to 51.2%, while Android grew to 41.8%.  Also note a weak, lower than more than two times, update activity to iOS 8, compared with the 7th version. <br><br>  In terms of traffic, the undisputed leaders remain social networks, and ‚ÄúMusic, Video and Media‚Äù rank first in terms of revenue. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/daa/1be/822/daa1be822cb84a11b9d417dc984414da.png"><br><br>  But in the ranking on the shows among the countries there are changes.  Asia is rapidly gaining momentum and ousted Europe to the third position.  Mexico stands out by profitability, which unexpectedly rose in the ranking right up to the 4th position. <br><br>  The share of video advertising is growing: in 2014, an increase of 3.5 times compared with last year.  Today, multimedia accounts for 15% of all mobile advertising, with 8.5% being video.  On advertising displays in the video format leading countries such as France, Spain and Italy. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3bf/c1f/285/3bfc1f28505f4a50a23371828c040100.png"><br><br>  The share of video display in the vertical of the advertising industry is dominated by such areas as entertainment and consumer goods.  Mobile publishers also consider mobile video to be profitable, since video shows the greatest effectiveness in advertising their products. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a2e/643/4b7/a2e6434b794d4c408b396c32cb635cdf.png"><br><br>  As for the length of the video, then allocate videos less than 15 seconds or 21-30 seconds.  In confirmation of the effectiveness of short videos, you can bring the geometric growth of investment in videos up to 20 seconds long. <br><br>  Applications in the categories ‚ÄúShopping‚Äù, ‚ÄúSport‚Äù, ‚ÄúSocial Services‚Äù and ‚ÄúHealth and Fitness‚Äù gave the best results to complete the viewing of mobile video advertising. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/072/723/13e/07272313ed904299af84d84de25117e2.png"><br><br><br><h4>  King shares fall in price </h4><br>  With King stock prices, everything happens according to a fairly familiar <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2014/10/20/stock-market-hammers-king-despite-new-candy-crush-game/">scenario</a> .  At the peak of popularity, the King company entered the IPO, scored a good payoff, and now the price is moving smoothly towards the fair.  Now King shares are selling at $ 11.60, compared to July, when the price has passed for $ 20, this is a very significant drop. <br><br>  According to the results of the financial report published by the company in August, it is clear that DAU fell from 143 million in the first quarter to 138 million in the second.  During the same period, the daily audience increased from 481 million to 485 million, while the number of unique players in all games fell from 352 million to 345 million. <br><br>  It can be concluded that King has occupied a niche and is competing with itself, offering several games to the same players.  However, the influx of new players declined and even began to roll back, with which analysts attributed the decline in the value of the company's shares.  Companies should diversify their portfolio by including new titles. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/241897/">https://habr.com/ru/post/241897/</a></p>
