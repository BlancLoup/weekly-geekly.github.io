Here is one of the halls, the average size: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8c3/db1/fcf/8c3db1fcfe524297a280030d6aea4323.JPG"><br><br>  In the lobby of each floor during the day you could drink coffee and eat a sweet bun. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/35d/d3b/bc8/35dd3bbc836044cead3d7e6994f4aec5.JPG"><br><br>  And in the evening - drink a beer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4ba/214/aa1/4ba214aa177b42c2b43a20508579bf05.JPG"><br><br>  The speakers raised various issues, organized master classes and drew attention to developing projects.  After all, as you know, the development of OpenSource solutions is impossible without creating a full-fledged community.  Developers encouraged to join projects such as the Dronecode project, OpenSwitch, OpenDOF, etc. <br><br>  It's time to go over the reports. <br><br><h5>  <font color="#cc0000">"Getting it right."</font>  <font color="#cc0000">Martin Fink, CTO at HP</font> </h5><br>  Martin recalled that OpenSource is the path that leads to innovation.  And with all its advancement in the world there are <a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical">already about 70 licenses</a> ! <br><br>  - We must stop the creation of new licenses!  - With this appeal, Martin turned to the community. <br><br>  The question was raised for a reason, because licenses are becoming <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/License_proliferation">incompatible with each other</a> , which is beginning to slow down the development of the idea of ‚Äã‚Äã"openness" of projects. <br><br>  Over its entire existence, HP has not created a single new license. <br><br>  It is noteworthy that Martin ten years ago already spoke out with a <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/2672445/operating-systems/hp-exec-decries-proliferation-of-open-source-license-types.html">similar censure of the</a> zoo.  Well, we wish him good luck, water wears away a stone! <br><br><h5>  <font color="#cc0000">"Seccomp", "strace".</font>  <font color="#cc0000">Michael Kerrisk (maintainer man)</font> </h5><br>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Kerrisk">Michael Kerrisk</a> is a born teacher. <br><br>  I listened to his reports about seccomp (man seccomp) and about strace (yes, strace!).  In both cases, I enjoyed and learned a lot. <br><br>  When I listened about <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/seccomp.2.html">seccomp</a> , I gained new knowledge about filtering system calls and using it. <br><br>  But when I was listening about strace, I was sitting and trying to understand why the hall was packed?  Does nobody know about strace?  This is unlikely, since very reputable speakers were also present at the lecture.  And it dawned on me - they came to learn how to talk about their programs!  And they came to the address. <br><br>  Indeed, Michael Kerrisk speaks with a soul about things that he knows very well.  He does not speak quickly, gives information according to the principle ‚Äúfrom the general to the particular‚Äù, forms the slides accordingly.  On his reports, people are not shy to ask questions, not only at the end, but also in the middle of the report.  In his report there is excitement and the audience appreciates it. <br><br>  He has a lot to learn, because too often the other speakers <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/thecroaker/death-by-powerpoint">don‚Äôt understand what they are talking about</a> . <br><br>  I took a picture with Michael, I will show children in old age. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f6e/c34/878/f6ec3487830541eeb0f686dbb1a3446f.JPG"><br><br>  By the way, who still does not have his book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Michael-Kerrisk/e/B0036HFFBI">I ask here</a> . <br><br><h5>  <font color="#cc0000">gnuplot.</font>  <font color="#cc0000">Harald Konig</font> </h5><br>  Before going to the report to Harald Koenig, I thought that I knew gnuplot quite well.  The fact is that I used it more than once to automatically create graphs. <br><br>  Harald went to the console, typed the gnuplot command, and away we go.  Somewhere in the middle of the report, a colored tux was already on the screen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/961/68f/b1b/96168fb1b39743f895a3cbf154502766.JPG"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dc7/7a6/b6b/dc77a6b6b7e3401c81461feaaa9dd758.JPG"><br><br>  Not that he discovered America, but I did not know some things, because I never needed them. <br><br>  But the most important thing is that apart from new tricks I made the following report from the report.  In linux there are countless cool programs like gnuplot.  In addition, each developer knows about the program, often as much as he needs to solve a particular task.  In some cases - a little more.  And to listen to the report of a person who knows some program at the expert level is priceless, because it opens up new opportunities for you. <br><br>  Therefore, I plan to introduce a special hour at Metrotek SEC (once a week, for a start) in which developers will share their experience in using linux tools.  Let's start with gnuplot. <br><br>  Do you know how to cook gnuplot? <br><br><h5>  <font color="#cc0000">" <a href="http://www.openswitch.net/">OpenSwitch</a> Architecture <a href="http://www.openswitch.net/">"</a> .</font>  <font color="#cc0000">Michael Zayats, HP</font> </h5><br>  As I said, the developers sought to draw attention to their projects in order to form a community.  One such project is OpenSwitch, developed by the HP team. <br><br>  I listened to the report with particular interest, since I would like to implement OpenSwitch into <a href="http://metrotek.spb.ru/x10-24.html">our switch</a> . <br><br>  The project is dedicated to the creation of an open network operating system.  Switch developers will be able to take OpenSwitch, write the necessary drivers for interaction with ASIC for it, add their software to taste and get a ready-made solution. <br>  Distributed under the Apache 2.0 license. <br><br>  One of the goals was to create an architecture similar to the <a href="http://openvswitch.org/">openvswitch</a> .  Developers adhere to the principles of aggressive modularity and reliability.  All data exchange between daemons (LACPd, etc.) and CLI occurs through the OVSDB database (see <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7047">RFC7047</a> ) taken from openvswitch, the Receiver template is actively used (the application ‚Äúsubscribes‚Äù to receive the events it ordered).  Json is actively used for data exchange, since it is the basis of the exchange with the OVSDB database. <br><br>  At the level of drivers for access to the ASICs, there is now support for the broadcom trident II (using the <a href="https://github.com/Broadcom-Switch/OpenNSL">OpenNSL SDK</a> ) and the virtual ASIC.  Thanks to the last openswitch, you can debug in a container on a virtual switch. <br><br>  The project has not yet acquired the status of production, now releases are rolled out only for the community.  Now the assembly (using Yocto) already gives a working image for Accton 5712 with ONIE. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c6d/85f/2ca/c6d85f2caca6437b9b03a555664543fa.JPG"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7e2/6e3/d4c/7e26e3d4c33e4556b367d6945b740a12.JPG"><br><br><h5>  <font color="#cc0000">The Future Of Drones.</font>  <font color="#cc0000"><a href="https://www.dronecode.org/">dronecode project</a></font> </h5><br>  The developers of dronecode took on the task of combining open-source projects in order to create an open platform for developing UAVs (Unmanned Avionic Vehicles). <br><br>  To interact with UAV, they chose <a href="http://qgroundcontrol.org/start">MAVlink</a> .  The OS used is a pseudo-OS called <a href="http://www.ros.org/">ROS (Robot Operating System)</a> .  And to simulate the physics of the behavior of the drone is proposed to use a <a href="http://gazebosim.org/">gazebo</a> .  Open iron for UAV is also there, the guys from dronecode talked about <a href="http://px4.io/">px4.io.</a> <br><br>  I was pleased with their approach, which shows how well the OpenSource-world is already developed: a lot has already been done and all that is needed is to combine efforts.  True, I did not quite understand the current development status. <br><br>  <a href="http://dronecode.org/">dronecode.org</a> <br><br><h5>  <font color="#cc0000">Creeping line</font> </h5><br><ol><li>  Developers from <a href="http://www.riteproject.eu/">riteproject spoke</a> , in general, they talked about optimizing the TCP stack in linux.  They considered several special cases because of which latency of connection grows.  They are threatening to push their patches into new versions of the kernel.  Links to approaches to optimization: <a href="http://bit.ly/1KVKeyb">one</a> , <a href="http://bit.ly/1FkmGvL">two</a> , <a href="http://bit.ly/1ejYIvC">three</a> , <a href="http://bit.ly/1HOwZhU">four</a> . <br></li><li>  At the exhibition, which was presented in one of the halls, Panasonic showed its <a href="https://opendof.org/">OpenDOF</a> project, which is about to be released.  This is a set of libraries for interacting with multiple devices in the cloud.  One of the features is that IoT devices can interact not only on the Internet, but also on other networks.  There are C # / C / Java interfaces. </li><li>  A developer from linuxtronic.org <a href="http://events.linuxfoundation.jp/sites/events/files/slides/praesentation.pdf">showed</a> how to load linux in one second.  He succeeded by using SPL instead of a full-fledged U-boot, compressing the kernel and disabling console output.  For demo used at91 (ARMv5). </li><li>  I learned that those bugs that stop playing after inserting printf are called <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2593%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B3">heisenbug</a> .  Live and learn. </li><li>  There was a cool talk from IBM about the BPF device and eBPF filters.  I recommend to look through the presentation.  <a href="http://events.linuxfoundation.org/sites/events/files/slides/ebpf_on_the_mainframe_lcon_2015.pdf">events.linuxfoundation.org/sites/events/files/slides/ebpf_on_the_mainframe_lcon_2015.pdf</a> .  I found out that now it is possible to keep statistics on filters using eBPF filters (a map is passed to the eBPF code) </li><li>  The Linux Foundation was selling certification for the Linux Certified System Administrator at a discount price.  They took two - we will play among the developers.  If anyone is interested, <a href="https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/lfcs">here is the link</a> . </li></ol><br><h5>  <font color="#cc0000">Celebrities</font> </h5><br>  I could not refuse to be photographed with Greg Kroah-Hartman (this is one of the main kernel kernels). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/df3/b1c/973/df3b1c97396c4d52b6e5bc3b9a8daa54.JPG"><br><br><h5>  <font color="#cc0000">Conclusion</font> </h5><br>  It was interesting.  Of course, with such a flow of information it is very difficult to understand the details, but you can appreciate where <strike>this</strike> world of linux is heading. <br><br>  Thank you so much <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/dzeban/" class="user_link">dzeban</a> for the company: it is always helpful to discuss what you see with your colleague in the evening, over a Guinness mug, in one of the many bars in the oldest district of Dublin. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f95/683/b71/f95683b7162f4412a129fead4b3e4c95.JPG"><br><br>  Next year they plan to hold a conference in Berlin.  It will be two times shorter, because it will not be combined with CloudOpen, and, I think, it will collect more linuxoids.  Next time you have to go with the performance.  Who knows, maybe in someone of us lies the talent of Michael Kerrisk? <br><br><h5>  <font color="#cc0000">Links</font> </h5><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Dd2hNbJu092M">Harald K√∂nig about gnuplot</a> (video from another conference, in German - everything you could find) </li><li>  <a href="http://www.openswitch.net/">Openswitch project</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.dronecode.org/">Dronecode project</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/lfcs">Linux Foundation Training</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://events.linuxfoundation.org/sites/events/files/slides/ebpf_on_the_mainframe_lcon_2015.pdf">Presentation about the device BPF / eBPF filters from IBM</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2593%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B3">What is heizenbug</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://events.linuxfoundation.jp/sites/events/files/slides/praesentation.pdf">Presentation about loading Linux in 1 second</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://opendof.org/">OpenDOF project for IoT</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.riteproject.eu/">TCP stack latency optimization approaches</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/License_proliferation">The problem of incompatibility of open-source licenses</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/268677/">https://habr.com/ru/post/268677/</a></p>
