I wanted to say that yesterday our third book came out, and the posts from Habra also helped a lot (and partially entered).  The story is this: for about 5 years, people who did not know how to design thinking, did not understand different business issues and asked the same questions came up to us. <br><br>  We sent them a forest.  In a sense, politely refused, because they did not consider themselves entitled to give advice.

      Because they themselves have not understood.  Then we stepped over the line of small business and came to the middle, tinkering with the methodology of plugging holes into normal processes, grabbing all kinds of crap like the theft of our own employees, big bureaucracy and other joys of a large company, then came up with a very logical and unexpected decision with large partnership. <br><br>  Then they began to answer questions.  Tellingly, these were the same questions and required the same answers.  Two years ago, there was a moral right to tell about what we have already seen on this path.  Six months ago, the book was added.  Yesterday she finally came out. <br><br>  When you write the third book, you already begin to understand what and how.  Below is a story about what you should know when you write your own.  Of course, this is my personal opinion, and not a ready-made methodology. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  How to write </h2><br>  You make an approximate table of contents, write 3-5 chapters with the most interesting.  Next shows to the publisher.  In the cover letter - briefly, who you are, what you are, why it is important.  We had a letter like this: ‚Äúit seems the best in Russia is a systematic look at how to do a small business.‚Äù  Not without distortions, but others simply did not exist.  Just recently, the Tinkov book (judging by the language, Ilyakhov) appeared ‚ÄúBusiness without an MBA‚Äù.  She is cool, she is about the same, there is a different look. <br><br>  The publisher reads your prototype chapters and asks what the trick is.  We say - we do not give advice on how to live.  We talk about specific situations and what happened in them.  How often.  How to test a hypothesis with examples.  What to look for in order not to screw it up. <br><br>  Here is the table of contents: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sv/j-/pe/svj-pe_umnpac07xjranaplp4om.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gy/ur/yz/gyuryzjpvu_kagpil9q8h66f8qy.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>Our main goal is to show not ‚Äúsuccessful success‚Äù, but how it is.</b> <br><br>  You know, it's like marrying a person you don't know well enough.  You can conclude an alliance "at random", and then divorce, and you can learn something about your potential second half in advance.  We are in advance.  Even if something terrible comes up there.  Because they saw how people sold apartments to close the debts of their business.  And then they stayed outside with their family and two children. <br><br>  If possible, avoid this. <br><br>  So here.  Then the publisher says - fundamentally "for."  And offers to send a manuscript.  It remains only to draw the rest of the owl. <br><br>  I have already written two books by that time, and roughly represented the process.  But it was very hard.  We rewrote the book twice, because we were constantly discovering new and new things.  It helped that we recorded a <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/biznes-na-svoi-mosigra">course</a> for the Cursors in Russian in the process.  There are many thoughts that are included in the book.  The course helped to understand what we want: there are tasks and an educational result. <br><br>  On assignments, I came off and understood approximately what stories are needed in a book.  Here are a couple of spoilers with answers: <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Here is a text sheet with examples</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><blockquote>  You decided to check whether you can sell ice cream on the beach in the resort town.  How to empirically check what the demand on the beach will be? <br><br>  [x] Buy ice cream at the grocery store, take dry ice, a box - sell it one day <br>  [] Buy a portable refrigerator and ice cream from a wholesaler and trade them one day <br>  [] Acquire everything you need for trade, and complete all the legal formalities to get started <br>  [] Ask friends from other cities. <br>  The faster and less costly you test a hypothesis, the better.  The origin of ice cream and other factors will not greatly affect the demand. </blockquote><br><blockquote>  You have the product ‚ÄúToothbrush Vyviglaz‚Äù, similar to ‚ÄúToothbrush Vyvvizub‚Äù, but less popular.  It was planned that you would sell 2,000 brushes in December, but in fact it turned out that now it is April, and there are 1,800 more of them in leftovers.  In this case, "Vyrvizub" take at a rate of 250 pieces per month.  You took "Vyrviglaz" at a very good price in November in advance.  Return to the supplier can be no more than 30%.  What to do in general? <br><br>  [x] Return to the supplier <br>  [x] Try to sell them at a discount or for a promotion like ‚Äúbuy two for the price of one‚Äù <br>  [] Leaving them to lie on the shelves - like, do not interfere, let them stand. <br>  [] Leave them on the shelves, but move them to the worst place in the display. <br>  [] Withdraw from the sale at the end of the month and dispose of. <br>  [x] Donate them (how much will remain at the end of the month) for humanitarian aid. <br><br>  Obviously you "froze" the money in this product.  Therefore, the task is to release the funds in order to invest them in the tradable goods, which will bring great profit in the same period.  First you return as much as you can to the supplier, and then sell them off on the stock.  Oddly enough, you can also use them for donations, if you are already doing them, otherwise you will have to sacrifice something that you have in a more liquid form. <br><br>  The same question about the brush, but they got you for implementation.  What is changing in relation to them now? <br><br>  [] Return, how much will the supplier <br>  [] Try to sell them at a discount or for a promotion like ‚Äúbuy two for the price of one‚Äù <br>  [] Leaving them to lie on the shelves - like, do not interfere, let them stand. <br>  [x] Leave them on the shelves, but move to the worst place in the display. <br>  [] Withdraw from the sale at the end of the month and dispose of. <br>  [] Donate them how much will remain at the end of the month for humanitarian aid. <br><br>  Yes, that's right, if you sell it, it is neither warm nor cold because of their presence.  Just push them away, and if the cost of renting a place in the layout does not exceed the profit from them (most likely not, on bad places), then let them lie.  They will slowly bring you money. </blockquote><br><blockquote>  Should a small store in advertising compare itself to a big one? <br><br>  [x] Yes, because being second in the market and biting the first is always cool.  Strategy AVIS - "We work because we want to get around them, we have something to strive for." <br>  [x] No, because you need to stand out with your head, and not belittle your neighbor <br>  [] No, because then the big one will be offended and ‚Äúpress‚Äù the small <br>  [] Yes, because in a small price is better, and it should see all <br><br>  You are laughing now, but options 1 and 2 are correct. Yes, it is for the reason described above - this is a strong position.  But no, it is not worth it for the second reason described, because this is the position for the game to go on.  Shops are already in a state of war, therefore (3) is irrelevant, and prices are not described in them.  In addition, in the village for 700-900 residents, information about prices is not available in advertising, but in attendants.  Instantly and accurately.  Perhaps it is better to start a rumor on the goods of comparison, and not to click on it in advertising. </blockquote><br><blockquote>  What can it mean if a person on the street does not know how to find your store - one of the 20 stores in the network? <br><br>  [x] What is he visiting <br>  [x] That you are not working well enough on local marketing <br>  [x] that he is an idiot <br>  [x] That you are not working well enough on global marketing <br>  [x] It's okay, not everyone should know this, maybe we are selling franzuz literature here <br><br>  It could mean anything, yes.  Only those who are in your target audience should know about you.  With them, and we must work. </blockquote><br><blockquote>  There were 120 candidates, 30 you called for an interview, 5 were taken to the store, 3 remained after the first three days.  Those 25 who did not pass the interview, you need to answer? <br><br>  [x] Yes, let them know that the job is busy. <br>  [] No, do not write once again, so as not to remind of the negative.  And it spends your time. <br><br>  Need to answer all.  This is etiquette.  And yet each of them is your potential customer.  Maintain a good relationship. </blockquote><br><blockquote>  A client bought a chair a week ago, lost a check, and wants to return it for the reason that he disliked it to him.  The chair is still in the package.  Can I make a refund? <br><br>  [x] Yes <br>  [] Not <br>  [] At the discretion of the seller <br><br>  Under the law on consumer protection - yes, it is possible without a check.  It is necessary to confirm the fact of purchase in any other way - an extract from the bank, an entry in your database or witnesses will do.  The reason for the return is not important, only the time is important. <br><br>  The client bought the book a week ago at another point, wants to return for the reason that it does not fit the wallpaper.  Return? <br><br>  [] Yes <br>  [x] No <br>  [] At the discretion of the seller <br><br>  A book, a newspaper, notes, a bra and other strange things are something that cannot be returned by law.  And it would be cool, right? </blockquote><br><blockquote>  Crime statistics in the region tells you that there is a probability of 0.273% that you will get on the head while carrying money to the bank.  You carry money to the bank every night.  Daily revenue on average is 30 thousand rubles. <br><br>  Encashment for a year costs 40 thousand rubles, let‚Äôs assume, for treatment, 5 thousand rubles, after which you return to normal without any damage to your business.  Is it economically worth the risk? <br><br>  [x] Yes <br>  [] Not <br><br>  The probability reaches the unit for the year, that is, the expectation of losses is 35 thousand rubles.  And collection - 40 thousand rubles. </blockquote><br></div></div><br>  The book does not have practical tasks, but there is a lot of real information.  Here is an example: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ef/mv/mb/efmvmbjgq7k_-d_lh-rv-mhgxcy.png"><br><br>  Okay, back to the project.  In the end you write.  By the way, it is easier at times to do it together than one, because where one has stopped, the second already knows what to say and how - and the opportunity arises not to ‚Äúhang out‚Äù, plus the second point of view.  Many years ago, the first published material - back in Astrakhan, in the newspaper - we also wrote in two hari.  Recommend.  Nightly gatherings with a huge pile of printouts, pens in the "Circle" for football (because only she worked) - this is a bonus. <br><br>  The next step is the publisher takes the manuscript.  Reads and confirms his opinion that the book will be normal.  In our case, the opinion was: ‚ÄúOh, here I‚Äôve also done something for myself to manage the publishing house.‚Äù  Otpad <br><br>  Then the contract and everything. <br><br><h2>  Contract and all affairs </h2><br>  The publisher wants an exclusive license, that is, it will not be possible to upload a copy without typos to Flibusta.  More importantly, the publisher wants a global license, that is, it will not be possible to translate and start selling on Amazon.  But at the same time the publisher wants 5 years, and then it is necessary to re-sign.  This means that there are only a couple of years left until the moment when I make a break in 1 day to transfer my first book to the pirates already officially and correctly. <br><br>  Now there is a trend in the development of home dofiga smart speakers and wireless headphones, so the podcast market comes to life in the West.  This will be noticeable in a year, but audio versions are needed now.  The corollary is to sign the dopnik about audio right away.  It is better to write an audio version in the voice of the author, but I do not pronounce the letter ‚Äúp‚Äù, therefore I stated this rrrrdochno and got the opportunity to choose a speaker.  Urrra  The audio version problem is the tables.  In the book they are.  Heavy rendered on the links. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/x_/ug/pm/x_ugpmq0pnkvo04ce-qy1uxaleq.jpeg"><br><br>  In our contracts, we still changed the order of approvals (not ‚Äúthe publisher suggested, but the author did not go away‚Äù, but a more correct one) and the order of quotations (I can quote up to half of the book on the Internet).  Over the years, the myth has become so friendly to the authors that it‚Äôs a pretty sight. <br><br>  If for the first time we were just offered a cover, now we are asked to fill out a brief.  The result was a design, as desired, and not how it went.  And without a capital set.  And with more or less correct kerning.  And without turning off the title in the center. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ry/pd/yv/rypdyvle-q7d1w_suxwifcceqws.jpeg"><br><br>  For the myth, it was somewhat bold.  But I am happy. <br><br>  In parallel, there is work with the editor and proofreader.  These are publisher services that are included in the training package.  The editor in our case suggested swapping a couple of chapters for better logic, asked for a bunch of footnotes with explanations, showed where to write a couple of chapters and about that, followed the logic and everything else. <br><br>  The proofreader just pissed me off.  I returned the first version back with the comment that you need to roll back all edits that do not relate to errors.  Because the proofreader decided that he himself would like to write a book and corrected everything in the language to the level of the official police protocol. <br><br>  Publisher said that yes, something overdone.  And they did it fine.  But still, there were language corrections, so I had to carefully read everything.  By the way, it‚Äôs a special joy in upholding the language to say that if anything, I will change all the terms to the word ‚Äúhorseradish‚Äù, because the plant and it is literary.  With this to argue within the rules can not be.  After this discovery it became somehow easier. <br><br>  Oh, and one more.  They adjust in Word, and somewhere from the third iteration they only look at edits.  Therefore, if you add something with Easter eggs with white text on the white background, then later, in the layout, they roll over styles and everything becomes black.  Pay attention to the Latin name of the sales funnel (specifically funnels) in the table of contents. <br><br><h2>  Promotion </h2><br>  When you have a pre-packaged preview file (with no output and no cover), people should give it to reviews.  We gave it to Eugene from Vkusvill, and they wrote a review, from which it is clear that they met there about the same thing, but are somewhat afraid to tell.  A couple more people just did not have time to read (we gave friends from large businesses, and there many had the nearest window in May, when the circulation was already leaving the printing house), Tinki did not answer at all. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mj/du/xe/mjduxeneub2wm9c1tsdfvvo-ixk.jpeg"><br><br>  It turned out that the MYTH does not mark the files it sends.  That is, if there is a leak in the network, it is not clear who leaked it.  Here's how: I do not mind leaks, but I want to know the vector.  Therefore, we have marked our own.  The technology was described in the fiction of my childhood - I advise the story "The destruction of Angkor Apeiron" by Fred Saberhagen. <br><br>  Circulation comes almost last.  This time the format is smaller than ‚ÄúBusiness as a game‚Äù and ‚ÄúBusiness Evangelist‚Äù, thick and white paper (thick and yellowish), fixed a bug with a ribbon booklet that can fly into the production under the cover and do something like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/z8/c3/wf/z8c3wf2tywewurapycxnkhlmi2w.jpeg"><br>  <sup>This is a rare case on "Business as a game"</sup> <br><br>  Then you all agree on the participation in the promotion.  I already knew that I would have to talk with journalists, participate in the airwaves, do an autograph session (refused), this year the Instagram-broadcast has also been added.  Plus there were requests for additional materials.  As usual, reporters will be given chapters directly to quote.  I think they will like the logic of the ‚ÄúWhy pay taxes‚Äù expansion.  Spoiler: not because it matters.  And because there is the principle of Gaffin - you assess the chance of getting caught and the benefits of crime.  And if it is, it has a rationale.  Plus other reasons.  A rational game is that in the tax are smart people who build restrictions on this principle.  True, the problem of Russia is that there are more traditions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ph/m3/7d/phm37dfij3_esv2sefrl1_rkfvk.jpeg"><br><br><h2>  The book itself </h2><br>  It turned out five main parts: <br><br><ul><li>  Preparing for the project even before you start to do something: these are basic things like what you need to understand, what you are getting involved in.  The story is this: there is a chance to earn a lot and lose a lot.  And this is exactly a couple of years of your time.  The first chance is not high, the second is higher.  If you could buy such a lottery ticket instead of starting a project, would you? </li><li>  Now the numbers: we are looking at the financial model, we are conducting exploration, we are experimenting.  The most important part of the project, because if you don‚Äôt understand what is possible and what is not, then everything will be bad. </li><li>  Opening the first point on the example of the store, everything from start to finish.  Here you can find out some of my posts from Habr, adapted for the book.  Why shop?  Because there all operations characteristic of other types of business are offline, plus more. </li><li>  Marketing - basic things.  We barely touch online (specific details become obsolete when the book is published), but we give general principles on how and what to evaluate. </li><li>  The staff is a damn important chapter about how to manage a team at a basic level for introverts. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qd/ws/f1/qdwsf1bbidbj4mivp526tbzcppq.jpeg"><br>  <sup>As usual, all this with a bunch of stories.</sup>  <sup>A major from my childhood read a past book and said that he was very happy.</sup>  <sup>I think he is waiting for another hello from the past.</sup> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ow/vd/cz/owvdczszkihhledw3vyqj-ozlm8.png"><br>  <sup>And practice, a lot of practice.</sup>  <sup>Check out the latest story on this page.</sup> <br><br>  Some chapters are very large and dense in scope of information: <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Picture-painting under the spoiler</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ej/oa/pz/ejoapzodjrtr-we-a_hnbjvmvcm.png"><br></div></div><br>  This year we tried an exclusive with the publishing house: it is very important for them to see sales on their online store and collect the first audience (otherwise we would sell everything directly from our site and in our stores).  Therefore, only two weeks the book is only with them, but for this they invest in the promo much more than usual, and promise a good numerical result of sales. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gy/t6/58/gyt658t1awa8ji1ievjva88ejf0.jpeg"><br><br>  Here is a <a href="https://www.mann-ivanov-ferber.ru/books/biznes-na-svoi/">link to the MYTH and all the details</a> , there you can buy.  Well, I want to say thank you to all those who asked us uncomfortable questions (about half - on Habr√©), which helped to really walk on what is important. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/453076/">https://habr.com/ru/post/453076/</a></p>
