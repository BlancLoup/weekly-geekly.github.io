Without prior knowledge of prosthetics, Mr. Ryan began by watching many educational videos on YouTube to see how this goal could be achieved.  A year later, without using anything other than the X-Box scanner and 3D printer at the University of Bangor, Saul's father created his first prototype. <br><br>  Sol's bionic arm allows him to use his elbow to create pressure that forces fluid to circulate inside the prosthesis.  The fluid pressure moves the thumb of the prosthesis, which allows you to take objects. <br><br>  Kate Smith, Sol‚Äôs mother, said that she hadn‚Äôt seen her husband all day long while he was working on his project in the barn, in their garden in Engles, sometimes it seemed to her that he was obsessed. <br><br>  ‚ÄúBut Ben is a very purposeful person, so I knew that it was his desire to help his son and that he would succeed.‚Äù <br><br>  In the leadership of the Ministry of Health, the invention of Ben Ryan was called ‚Äúpossibly revolutionary in prosthetics‚Äù. <br><br>  After succeeding with a prosthesis for his son, Ryan set himself a goal to collect ¬£ 150,000 through a <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/helping-the-youngest-infants-adapt-to-prosthetics">crowdfunding page</a> to allow his Ambionics company to enter the prosthetic market. <br><br>  Can a similar project appear in Russia?  Will affordable, and at the same time high-quality and functional prostheses be available for our disabled people?
