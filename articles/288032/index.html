Favorite readers in their favorite forums "KV" write about the uselessness of the reviews and their author's audacity, appealing to patriotism and literacy.  I am inclined to explain these mood swings on Friday, the thirteenth, and to move on to the two-digit designation of the number of the next review. <br><br>  The theme of the week in the Russian-speaking LJ was ‚ÄúCrime and Punishment‚Äù.  Summary: Comrade Sidorov, Asa, constantly sent various messages like ‚ÄúWe need blood, 3 rhesus group ...‚Äù and other ‚Äúletters of happiness‚Äù to Comrade Ivanov.  Ivanov asked Sidorov to stop making him happy with such messages, but the requests were not heard.  Then Ivanov, in the next similar message, replaced the phone number with Sidorov's number and sent further.  During the day, Sidorov received more than a hundred calls from people who were willing to donate their blood.  Who was right and who was wrong, even Chernyshevsky could not understand where I was.  It remains only to report the <a href="http://livejournal.com/users/koxed/271.html">link</a> .  Caution!  Inside are very tough comments.  A wonderful article on this subject appeared on the <a href="http://register.intruder.ru/2006/01/13">intruder's register</a> blog.  It describes not only this case, but also a few more that have occurred recently.  For example, an eighteen-year-old girl pushed out of a subway car when the train was standing at the station, an arrogant and rude child of about five years old.  I am even inclined to rejoice with the author that the girls only push the children out of the subway, and do not hit them, for example, with a shoe in their heads.  Perhaps only for now.

      And this week, for some reason, they decided to go through the asphalt-roller on rock music.  At first, al_t_er decided to <a href="http://livejournal.com/users/al_t_er/5135.html">pay tribute to</a> all the rock dinosaurs, who were lucky enough to live to this day.  So, McCartney is called musical marazmatik, Mick Jager is the mummy of 40 years of aging, and the bulldog's face Ozzy Osborne - expressing more meaning than the face of its owner.  And the next day, orange303 tells the <a href="http://livejournal.com/users/orange303/1097234.html">tale</a> of the princess imprisoned in the castle and the dragon guarding it.  There are several endings to the tale, depending on what style of rock music the Prince-Savior is a fan of. <br><br>  Finally, the third star of the week was Chuck Norris.  It's amazing how much, it turns out, there are <a href="http://livejournal.com/users/jetfraer/310099.html">facts about Chuck Norris</a> .  For example: "On the last page of the Guinness Book of Records in small print it is indicated that all world records belong to Chuck Norris, and the book simply lists the people who managed to get close to them." <br><br>  The <a href="http://icontext.ru/blog/">iConText</a> blog analyzes <a href="http://icontext.ru/blog/2006/01/16">the global brand charts</a> , which cost more than a billion dollars, published by BusinessWeek. <br><br>  I think many of you have such friends <a href="http://livejournal.com/users/cerf/60412.html">as Venya</a> , the hero of the story cerf'a.  A young, cheerful nerd who is constantly late for work, sending out porn-letters to clients and telling his boss that he has syphilis and therefore cannot work. <br><br>  How can I get around the toilet theme?  No  Moreover, the performance of the girl is so colorful, glamorous and, as they say, with a twinkle.  Pile ferociously brazen <a href="http://livejournal.com/users/svaja1/64586.html">rabid feminism</a> and on all fronts attacking women's public toilets. <br><br>  Maxim Makarenkov, author of the <a href="http://coldflow.blogspot.com/">Cold Stream</a> blog, presented to the general attention excerpts from the works published at Samizdat, which were <a href="http://coldflow.blogspot.com/2006/01/blog-post_12.html">sent to</a> him by the <a href="http://coldflow.blogspot.com/2006/01/blog-post_12.html">authors for publication</a> in the Lenizdat publishing house.  Perhaps, dear readers will find similar bloopers and on the pages adored "KV"?  Be sure to send - publish! <br><br>  The townsfolk will not calm down about the gas "friendship" between Russia and Ukraine.  It would seem that the government of each country declared the conclusion of a new contract as its victory and continued to fight for the electorate.  In the Crimea, there were lighthouses, which urgently needed to inspect.  People are able to have fun, envy.  So Polina Voloshina composed a beautiful drama in five acts " <a href="http://livejournal.com/users/samka/933758.html">Unfinished piece for a gas pipeline</a> ".  Ordinary everyday life. <br><br>  Each person has the right to choose, to love or to hate the rock glamor group "Animals".  In any case, this is precisely what the World Declaration of Human Rights is trying to convince us of.  That's just the UN Roma Beast has not yet reached, but to us - already.  In this regard, Mukaltin brainstorms the phrase " <a href="http://livejournal.com/users/mukaltin/119207.html">Roma, I'm sorry ...</a> ".  I was inspired to write this review: ‚ÄúFish, I'm sorry, I have a sausage.‚Äù <br><br>  <a href="http://web-blog.ru/">The internet marketing blog</a> reveals <a href="http://web-blog.ru/2006/01/16">all the details of the</a> secret agreement between Yandex and Mail.ru.  True, the agreement has already become official. <br><br>  Of course, LJ is a scary place.  Once there, a person begins to speak Albanian and write the word "offset" through "o".  University teachers are especially affected.  Taoky tried to imagine the situation <a href="http://livejournal.com/users/taoky/245851.html">if Pushkin had a LJ</a> .  The author believes that then neither ‚ÄúEugene Onegin‚Äù nor ‚ÄúI remember a wonderful moment ...‚Äù would not have happened. <br><br>  Seriously.  It turns out that there are worms on Mars!  Glass!  I <a href="http://livejournal.com/users/nekto/582408.html">was informed about this by</a> Ivan Polikarov, and I inform you.  A few years ago, a NASA satellite sent photographs to Earth that scientists are unable to explain.  To finally convince you that this is not a joke, I will clarify: these photos can be easily found on the official NASA website.  Why are politicians and media silent? <br><br>  Naturally, bloggers <a href="http://hvost.org/%3Fp%3D172">could not disregard</a> Friday, which was recklessly on the calendar on the date of January 13th.  <a href="http://hvost.org/">HvosT</a> in his blog lucidly talks about various nasty things happening on such an unexpected day. <br><br>  Anton Smalluk wrote a large and very <a href="http://livejournal.com/users/antonsm/2101.html">interesting article</a> about the historical center of Minsk with photos and pictures. <br><br>  As everyone knows, LiveJournal is the abbreviation of LiveJournal.  And lenadoe publishes links to <a href="http://livejournal.com/users/lenadoe/49172.html">real live magazines</a> .  From October 1, 1998, Jonathan Keller at the end of each day publishes a photo of himself, in his blog.  Naturally, Jonathan had followers with different variations. <br><br>  Four different opinions in the topic with the name " <a href="http://livejournal.com/users/andrin/122613.html">Copon Lawlessness</a> ".  Andrin tells a story that happened in their small military town, but the perpetrators and victims changed with kaleidoscopic rapidity.  The name, by the way, is not in vain in quotes. <br><br>  Oleg Kuvaev (the author of Masyani, if someone is not up to date) is surprised at his sense of humor and <a href="http://livejournal.com/users/samoleg/67196.html">lays out footage</a> from one famous film, of course, having rethought them creatively. <br><br>  A remarkable <a href="http://livejournal.com/users/fufonja/148759.html">nostalgic photograph of</a> 1994 - in the foreground is the then mayor of St. Petersburg, Anatoly Sobchak, and behind him is an imperceptible one, with a newspaper, GDP.  Who could have guessed then, right? <br><br>  Until today I have not confessed to you, I was embarrassed, but finally I took myself in hand and I can safely write that I love Valery Ilyinichna Novodvorskaya!  Therefore, I am offended that Leva Brown called Valery a fascist and snapped <a href="http://livejournal.com/users/leva_brown/277265.html">quotes from her brilliant articles and speeches</a> .  Novodvorskaya turned out to be a fascist with the order number 14, references to the rest are also available. <br><br>  And now a review of the past week from Jamshid, the author of the <a href="http://jamshid.ru/">blog of the</a> same name and our countryman.  By the way, Jamshid himself tried this week.  For example, an amusing selection of <a href="http://jamshid.ru/2006/01/14">MTS.</a>  <a href="http://jamshid.ru/2006/01/14">Pearl subscribers # 8</a> .  Well, I give the podium myself: <br><br>  Over the past week, bloggers wrote about different events: someone watched another film, read another book, put a new program or updated the engine - and so forth, so on.  Of the significant events noted by many, I remember the surge in popularity of the <a href="http://moikrug.ru/">My Circle</a> service, a social network for professional contacts, in which most well-known bloggers gathered.  Those who have not used, I recommend to look at this promising project. <br>  The blogosphere ru (online inter- net) still continues its development and self-determination, with the increasingly frequent <a href="http://livemarketing.ru/2006/01/12/170">tendency of separating</a> stand-alone blogs from LiveJournal and other blog services.  The number of blogs is also growing by leaps and bounds, and the quality is improving.  Of course, this is perceived ambiguously - someone likes blogs, someone - on the contrary, but one way or another, this is a phenomenon that even opponents and competitors in the face of traditional media already have to reckon with.  Last week, the President of the United States signed the law, according to which the publication on blogs of anonymous comments of an offensively irritating nature equates to a crime and is subject to criminal prosecution.  We have, fortunately, the need for such a law has not yet matured, but the fact that blogs are noticed at the state level is quite remarkable. <br>  Another significant event: on January 14, the <a href="http://exler.ru/">Exler</a> website was 7 years old, with which I would like to congratulate him.  Moreover, the site has a direct relationship to the blogosphere, more recently having a separate section " <a href="http://exler.ru/blog">blog</a> ". <br><br>  <b>Your personal aggregator Alexey Kaletsky</b> <br><br>  <a href="http://kv.by/index2006030601.htm">Published in "Computer News" (# 3, 2006)</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/288032/">https://habr.com/ru/post/288032/</a></p>
