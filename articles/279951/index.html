Now it is a useful tool for merchants, analysts and marketers.  For managers - the ability to monitor performance and monitor the sales department.  And in case of moving - all phone numbers remain, because they are no longer tied to the place.  Data, statistics and settings are stored in a secure cloud. <br><br>  <b>Read more about virtual PBX - <a href="http://www.altegrocloud.ru/">www.altegrocloud.ru</a></b> <br><br>  With the development of virtual PBXs, call recording, voice greetings, virtual queues, and integration with CRM systems have appeared.  Thanks to these functions, it became possible to count the indicators, increase the sales department conversion, refine the conversation script, monitor and help employees. <br>  IP telephony is constantly evolving.  Several years ago, FMC technology appeared, which united mobile and office internal phones into one network.  Now, knowing only the short extension number of the employee, you can call him directly on the mobile, no matter where the person is at the moment.  NextTell developed and implemented such a solution, this is a FMC-based product - <a href="http://altegrosim.ru/">AltregroSIM.</a> <a name="habracut"></a>

    <h4>  <b>What is useful AltegroSIM</b> </h4><br>  Now the company's courier or manager, being out of the office, is available by its extension number. <br>  And when an incoming call from such a mobile is displayed, the common office number is displayed, which is very convenient for the client, for example, who meets the package. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ae8/da6/c33/ae8da6c330424e0a92fe3aba3d8291c5.png" alt="image"><br>  <em>If you integrate FMC with a CRM system, the courier will immediately contact the customer by calling the order number.</em>  <em>Without the help of a manager.</em>  <em>In this case, the client will see the usual office number and understand that they are calling from your company.</em> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b4e/b38/b3c/b4eb38b3ca3f4964bbfed2cb463a5bd7.png" alt="image"><br>  <em>An employee on a business trip or ‚Äúon a remote‚Äù is available for a short extension number.</em> <br><br>  Calls are IP-based.  It is much cheaper than regular cellular communication: a minute between cities will cost 2‚Äì3 rubles.  It is especially beneficial to use AltegroSIM if employees travel on business trips or you have a network of branches in different cities: calls are free within the corporate network. <br><br><h4>  <b>FMC working principle</b> </h4><br>  Mobile phone with a SIM-card Altegro works in the GSM-network of the cellular operator.  But, unlike conventional SIMs, AltegroSIM does not use the federal number, but uses the internal numbering of the client. <br><br>  All calls from SIM-cards go through the GSM-network, and then are sent via SIP to your PBX.  At the same time, the PBX recognizes AltegroSIM as a standard IP phone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a52/3aa/e33/a523aae338c940b6b4144b0f0f4b64fa.png" alt="image"><br>  <em>Calls from cellular pass through your PBX.</em> <br><br>  You control corporate mobile communications and have the same features and functions as office desk phones: calls from AltegroSIM are included in the PBX statistics and processed by your scenarios (for example, monitoring employee costs for mobile communications in real time, monitoring calls, assigning rights). <br><br><h4>  <b>By the summer of 2016 we will cover the whole of Russia</b> </h4><br>  AltegroSIM is actively developing: every season we connect new regions, we increase the stability and quality of work in already working areas. <br><br>  Today, FMC technology is available in Moscow and the Moscow region, the North-West region, the Caucasus, the South region and the Volga region. <br><br>  Testing is underway in the Central, Siberian and Far Eastern regions, and by the summer of 2016 we will launch FMC in Yekaterinburg and continue development in the Urals. <br><br><h4>  <b>Experience of introducing AltegroSIM into a flower delivery company</b> </h4><br>  Flora Delivery - a flower delivery service in Moscow uses a virtual PBX in its office.  Orders go straight to the CRM ‚Äì system, end-to-end analytics and cohort analysis are established. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/87f/12a/973/87f12a97335c47b2a4291eda39bd9325.png" alt="image"><br>  <em>Office flower delivery service Flora Delivery.</em> <br><br>  But the way the courier delivers the order and talks to the customer has always been the ‚Äúpain‚Äù of the business.  On peak days, it is often necessary to hire a third-party courier service.  Delivery quality is always difficult to monitor and objectively evaluate.  And the courier is the main face of the company, he calls up and hands flowers to the recipient. <br><br>  Constant clarifying calls and chimes due to cliffs heavily loaded the call center.  While the manager finds out the order number or talks to the courier, a customer who wants to order flowers is waiting on the second line. <br><br>  Telephone routine always hurts the quality of service, increases costs.  The easiest way is to hire another manager.  But we need to solve the problem not quantitatively, but qualitatively.  And we connected AltegroSIM. <br><br><h5>  <b>First results after connecting AltegroSIM</b> </h5><br>  After the introduction of FMC, the order processing speed increased, it became easier to work with couriers, but there was another unclear problem: an employee of the company, for example, a courier, called a client from his mobile phone, the client displayed not a federal number with the prefix +7 (9XX), but number with code 495, 499. If the client called back to this number because of a connection breakdown or simply worried while waiting for the courier, then he would get to the common office number.  And in order to contact a specific employee, he had to go through the ‚ÄúVoice greeting‚Äù.  If a client came to the manager, then in order to understand the situation and connect it with the right courier, it was necessary to find out the order number or what flowers and at what address ... <br><br><h5>  <b>Problem solving</b> </h5><br>  We analyzed the problem of ‚ÄúFlora Delivery‚Äù, refined the technology and adapted AltegroSIM taking into account the peculiarities of the delivery business. <br><br>  Such a problem can face any courier service, connecting yourself FMC. <br><br>  We are the only ones who made it possible to display on the subscriber‚Äôs screen a client, a personal mobile number, and not a common office one.  At the same time keep all the functionality of the office PBX. <br><br>  Such a trifle immediately corrected the situation.  Mobile calls through AltegroSIM were no different from normal ones.  At the same time conversations were recorded, all the necessary statistics were kept.  This made it possible to calculate and evaluate the effectiveness of each courier: <blockquote> ‚ÄúWith the help of AltegroSIM, the issue of quality of delivery has finally been resolved.  It became clear that if the courier on the phone is already beginning to communicate inadequately or even speak rudely, it means that he is not giving it away.  The one who unacceptably rudely talked with clients on the phone - the last day he worked with us.  An indicator of courier efficiency was not only the speed of delivery, but also the ability to communicate with the recipient. <br>  As a result, they changed 1 regular courier.  More selectively began to relate to the choice of other people's couriers through small interviews.  Prepared a card for communication, which suggest how to engage in dialogue.  After the delivery of flowers, we started sending a questionnaire to the client‚Äôs mail with questions about the quality of the service.  Got helpful feedback. <br>  Managers began to cope with the routine and less tired.  Waiting response was reduced by 2 times.  LTV grew by 8%. <br>  Identified another layer of problems where you need to improve service and reduce costs.  Without AltegroSIM, we would never get to that at all. ‚Äù <br></blockquote>  <em>Maria Vinogradova, general director of Flora Delivery LLC.</em> <br><br><h5>  <b>AltegroSIM solves major business problems</b> </h5><br><ol><li>  Reduces the load on call center managers </li><li>  Controls ‚Äúfield‚Äù vendors, employees ‚Äúon the remote‚Äù and couriers </li><li>  Increases customer processing speed, improves service quality </li><li>  Saves on long-distance calls, reduces travel expenses </li></ol><br>  <b>Read more about AltegroSIM - <a href="http://altegrosim.ru/">www.altegrosim.ru</a></b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/279951/">https://habr.com/ru/post/279951/</a></p>
