      The fact that the labor market has changed seriously over the past decade, and especially sharply these changes have hurt the IT industry, is simply absurd to deny.  Unfortunately, the search for sane personnel every year becomes an increasingly difficult challenge for managers and HR managers. <br><br>  <b>Where do legs grow</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-x/ek/sw/-xekswcfgpla-po7u20tufs3-h4.jpeg"><br><br>  Naturally, the change of generations leaves its mark on the face of any production team.  The specificity of IT companies is that the average age of its employees is constantly striving for a conditional 25 years - the peak of the physical and mental abilities of a person.  Apparently the ability to quickly and accurately understand the new direction is a decisive factor, which throws into the background the need to have a hefty baggage of experience, which the office old-timer can trump.  The average, if I may say so young, age of employees is only slightly adjusted by 30‚Äì40 year-olds who possess the experience that is critical for the company's work.  Yesterday‚Äôs graduates of unrestrainedly bred courses, training programs, universities preparing programmers, testers, web designers, and so on.  massively storming IT companies, thereby filling out a frank personnel shortage in the industry.  Having not yet overcome his rebellious age, and often with minimal, God forbid, a positive work experience anywhere else, such a contingent can form from <a href="http://dou.ua/lenta/articles/portrait-2017/">30% to 70%</a> of the company's employees, and we have to deal with this reality. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/px/hv/my/pxhvmycppgotxm-zr-mmmyk3r1k.png"><br><br>  The crux of the problem - the misunderstanding between the head of department held in his place, the HR manager, the founder and the young specialist is as old as the world.  New here are the conditions in which you have to interact with the personnel acquisition.  External conditions are clearly not on the side of managers.  The crowd of unbridled young, spoiled by ‚Äúoutsourcing‚Äù salaries ( <a href="http://anothercitizenship.com/pmzh/stoimost-zhizni-i-ceny-v-amerike.html">at the domestic price of potatoes</a> ), the possibility of easy migration between countless IT companies, gathering in a bunch and getting these tasks from these personnel, also with a deadline, becomes a very ambitious task. <br><br>  But besides the objective reasons for the rejuvenation of the labor market, it is also worth noting that in 2018, the young specialist is noticeably different from his colleague in 2008, for his moral and business qualities. <br><br>  <b>Generation ‚ÄúZ‚Äù</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tb/qm/rz/tbqmrztdgxp6i77obuxitnx4gdm.jpeg"><br><br>  Conditional division into generations of people "X, Y, Z" is not new.  A new reality when the representatives of this generation filled the space between the monitor and the keyboard.  The network on this subject there are many <a href="http://ru.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5_Z">materials</a> and interesting research.  Regarding our subject matter, it is possible to identify and disassemble a few of the most characteristic features of people formed in the era of the ‚ÄúInternet‚Äù, which must be remembered when hiring them for a job, or by setting them a specific task. <br><br>  <i>Fragmentary thinking</i> <br><br>  Unfortunately, the general drop in the level of classical higher education, and its replacement by short-term courses and narrowly focused programs, solve the problem of personnel hunger in ITshniki due to an obvious drop in their quality. <br><br>  At the same time, having wide access to the most variegated information, a conscious young man is lost in it and cannot concentrate on the right directions, overloading his brain with useless knowledge. <br><br>  In the above two cases, at the exit, we get a specialist with the problem of seeing the integrity of the ‚Äúpicture of the world,‚Äù as well as the processes that form it.  People with such thinking, even being very informed about everything, in fact will not understand anything concrete.  As a result, it can be very problematic for such a ‚Äúbroad specialist‚Äù to achieve a solution to the task. <br><br>  <i>Event concentration 8 seconds</i> <br><br>  Our brain pays so much attention to the ordinary stimuli that enter it, be it a pop-up banner, a spectacular member of the opposite sex, a collegiate / leader remark.  Although the statement is rather vague, its essence is understandable, which is also confirmed by personal, industrial experience.  To keep attention on details, more conditional 8 seconds, it becomes more and more difficult for a person in an overcrowded information space, because even during this meager time a more relevant information event may occur that crosses out its predecessor.  Knowing this feature, the very presentation of information from the manager should not only be concise, but also as colorful as possible, or the information message risks being overwritten in the mind of the person by another ‚Äúcat‚Äù from the FB tape. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/2p/ip/wf/2pipwfmvooemtysiokyuiwbql1g.jpeg"><br><br>  <i>Individualism</i> <br><br>  It is this parameter that can become the strength of a young employee who is willing to take responsibility for solving problems without counting on colleagues.  But unfortunately, this quality is also not rarely responsible for terry narcissism formed by yesterday's "pioneer", which is correspondingly burdened by little life experience.  And not least this leads to a reassessment of their, most often limited, possibilities.  As a result, the solution of a simple problem may drag on for a long time, and the moment when the employee still voices its presence, and shyly asks for help, may become critical for the project. <br><br>  <i>Hyper mobility</i> <br><br>  Another feature of modern youth is its mobility, in the broadest sense.  What was in essence the achievement of our society ‚Äî the ability to easily change our geographical position, quickly master new activities, for responsible employers turned into a staff turnover and a lottery when hiring new team members.  It is for this reason that now in serious companies so much attention is paid to competitive tasks when hiring a person.  Skeptical attitude to all kinds of diplomas and certificates naturally dictated by the ease of obtaining them, the most outspoken dolt.  After all, the lack of basic knowledge of mathematics in yesterday's schoolchild does not stop him from the desire to see himself as a programmer in a foreign salary. <br><br>  <b>Random people</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bo/nl/bs/bonlbsvrpv2fd9fvfolatncq4wc.jpeg"><br><br>  The Ishnikov boom that has been going on for at least 15 years has played a cruel joke with so many people.  Having access to the Western labor market and the corresponding material remuneration, an ordinary resident of a post-Soviet country, with a smoldering economy, faced a dilemma - to engage in his favorite activities for pennies, or to stick to a monitor equipped with cacti for three or four months of salary in his own factory. <br><br>  As a result, casual people in IT, saddened by office life ‚Äî engineers, physicians, teachers, and military men who didn‚Äôt knock down IT with easy money, have become a tangible problem of today.  The solution to this problem, unfortunately, is not in our hands.  Only the realization by the person himself of his place in life, and the understanding that ultimately happiness is not in money, as well as with the growth of the general welfare of society, the person who came to the office can make a more free choice of profession, deciding to devote himself to the keyboard and monitor, or return to more comfortable for themselves living environment. <br><br>  <b>Motivation</b> <br><br>  It would seem that there could be easier?  The higher the material remuneration for the work and the higher the motivation of the employee to fulfill the tasks set by the manager.  But as practice shows, this thought is far from the truth, and it concerns not only junior specialists, but also experienced office soldiers. <br><br>  Capitalism in the frantic form in which we observe it in the post-Soviet space cannot be seen even in the developed countries of the ‚ÄúWest‚Äù for a banal reason - it is not viable. <br>  Now not the hungry 90s, the level of modern wages in the economies of Eastern European countries, allows for a minimum level of decent living.  Accordingly, higher wages in such competitive areas of labor as IT, for the majority of people, have ceased to be a physiological necessity, as it was 15-20 years ago, forcing a more responsible approach to their duties and really value their workplace.  The current trend states how the motivation of the size of the salary is increasingly receding into the background.  Giving the possibility of implementing minor person's helpers, ‚ÄúITshnaya‚Äù salary sluggishly creates a desire to work for them. <br><br>  Stimulus, at the level of earnings, are increasingly distinct factors such as the legality of the company (this is especially true for the gray economies of the social camp), payment stability, career growth, specific tasks to be performed, a normalized schedule, management loyalty to the workforce, and working comfort. etc.  The pursuit of a high salary in a semi-legal company, where there is at least no minimum "social sphere" - overtime pay and free barbaris in the buffet, for a self-respecting expert this is yesterday. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bm/v2/nj/bmv2nj_svz--pijn_wu0yra-i-8.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>Their morals</b> <br><br>  Interesting here is the experience of our Western colleagues.  On the one hand there is a clear trend of socialization of the workplace.  In addition to a decent level of wages, providing a social package with honey.  insurance, the ability to take long vacations, with paying a fitness visit / yoga, is becoming the norm.  Moreover, once in the country of the Soviets called departmental polyclinics, kindergartens, sanatoriums are now increasingly used by large IT companies to attract and retain an employee, taking care of him from all life's adversities, giving him the opportunity to concentrate exclusively on production tasks.  Such complexes as Apple Park and Googleple are an attempt to reach a new level, the desire to create not just a comfortable workplace, but rather a <a href="http://habr.com/post/170433/">living space</a> , an entrance ticket to which for a person is complicity in the company's activities.  By creating a sphere of comfort, social contacts, and hobbies around a person, a company can bind to a useful specialist much more than an uncontrolled increase in earnings. <br><br>  Unfortunately, watching such an idyllic picture in the ‚ÄúWest‚Äù, our average person often sees only bright facades of cozy offices with many ‚Äúfreebies‚Äù and freedoms.  At the same time, in the shade are the codes of written and unwritten rules, for non-observance of which you can easily get a fine, dismissal, atoms, and generally thunder under a criminal article. <br><br>  Often, the lack of understanding of limiters, the pitfalls of work in European and American companies, our ordinary employee unjustifiably corrupts him, which creates a lot of trouble not only for world-famous people - managers, but also for their sane colleagues.  The reverse side of the coin is not often mentioned under colorful photographs of futuristic campuses. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ev/nc/st/evncstl450lksweljwrijvmqqum.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>Results</b> <br><br>  Yes, the post-Soviet countries are still attractive for European and overseas outsourcing, but if earlier we were an explosive mixture: a skilled workforce not spoiled by the attention, ready to solve complex problems for the salary of a vegetable baseman in Ohio, now the reality is not so colorful.  Obviously, such a trend is a threat not only to respectable employees, but also to the entire IT industry as a whole, now it is far from uncommon when ‚Äúour‚Äù companies are looking for sane ITshnikov abroad, giving away whole directions in their activities for a row.  What is it?  Inherent problems of growth of the industry with access to a qualitatively new, higher level of working conditions, wages, the ability to solve more complex problems, or, conversely, the general degradation?  The answer to this question will already give a new, so soon coming, 2019. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ch/eq/jl/cheqjlqhqfow6id21ghxrpcqx3o.jpeg"><br><br>  Thank you for staying with us.
