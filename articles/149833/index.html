  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Experts called "endangered" professions in the world</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  An interesting turn of events.  For some, this is no longer news, but progress does not stand still and very soon, half of the existing professions will be unclaimed in the labor market.  And what is most interesting, some of these professions began their journey from the shaggy years. <br>  According to experts, the list of endangered occupations is as follows: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/4c6/7f4/96b/4c67f496b0e3c38e0dc05d4dad76446d.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><ul><li>  Postmen.  The fairly widespread e-mail was only one of the reasons for the gradual extinction of the postal industry as such.  The main factor is the partial or full automation of the procedure for sorting packages and letters.  Simply put, robots today replaced mail employees.  Emails are increasingly being sent via the Internet or via telephone calls.  For example, in the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics predict a sharp reduction in the number of vacancies in this area by as much as a third by 2018. </li><li>  Secretaries.  The development of technologies, which can completely deprive job vacancies of office clerks as well, is proceeding rapidly.  Modern innovations in the form of the Internet, voice mail and other know-how enable professional employees to carry out all administrative work independently, without needing the services of secretaries and back office.  For example, the European Center for Vocational Education makes predictions for staff reductions among office clerks in the European Union, by at least one million employees by 2020. </li><li>  Workers.  In many civilized countries, professions that require a minimum set in terms of professional skills, where workers have a secondary education, are also a thing of the past.  Thus, after seven or eight years in the UK, the number of laborers will decrease by four hundred thousand people. </li><li>  Employees of telemarketing / sales by phone / and direct sales.  Sales representatives, who are seriously fed up with many of their own sudden visits to offices and homes, will also very soon become just a memory.  Especially if you have the opportunity to connect to the Internet and buy everything in the shops, whatever you want, without leaving your home.  The profession, by the way, is ineffective for implementations, because manufacturers switch to Internet, as well as TV sales. </li></ul><br>  But that is not all.  The Internet also absorbs television with the press.  Below is the dialogue of the French analyst Isabel Weira-Mason. <br>  <b>- Is the Internet coming to television and its audience?</b> <br><br>  - Recall the story: the media replace each other, evolve with respect to each other.  The emergence of new media does not necessarily mean the disappearance of old ones.  Television did not make the radio disappear.  All of them can obviously coexist. <br>  In addition, it should be noted that television has never before been so influential.  The time that people spend in front of television screens continues to grow, not only in the United States, but also in France.  The Internet did not affect this.  Television is very active, especially when it comes to political events, for example, the Arab revolutions ... The beginning was made not by the Internet, but by the Arab television channel Al-Jazeera.  It was he who set the tone in Tunisia, Egypt and other countries and created the ground for reflection on the Arab spring.  Television plays a political role. <br>  People talk about increasing the number of channels, and this is true.  Their number has increased tenfold.  This means that the industry is doing well and is a sign of high demand.  The audience during sporting events and political events is very impressive.  Television is the dominant media of our era, and the Internet is not a threat to it. <br>  <b>- So how did the Internet affect television?</b> <br><br>  - The Internet has affected the content of the programs.  Thanks to the network, television was able to adapt, primarily in the information sphere.  News releases still gather a huge audience, but the only difference is that today the viewers will know in advance about what is happening from the Internet.  These programs have ceased to be a source of world news for them.  The Internet has accelerated the development of this trend.  As a result, news broadcasts have to adapt to new audiences. <br>  In addition, the Internet has allowed an end to censorship.  Why hush something on television, if the Internet is so full of rumors and hidden information?  This is something like Wikileaks syndrome, in which Julian Assange tells all about the political backstage.  So why should television hide all this now?  The Internet makes no sense of all censorship.  However, this does not mean that they do not exist: they simply become completely different.  The most amazing thing on the Internet is the disappearance of certain boundaries.  This is a super-media, a mixture of three previously existing sources of information that affect established practices and habits.  There are essentially no boundaries anymore, and the public is mixed with the private.  Television immediately switched to these new rails.  No moral barriers exist anymore, everything turns into entertainment.  This is a very serious change. <br>  The Internet has also broken the barriers between ‚Äúreal people‚Äù and professionals.  Thanks to the network, viewers have become ‚Äúexperts‚Äù in politics and entertainment.  Some professionals point out that their specialty is fading away, and their roles are gradually moving away to "ordinary" people.  All people on television are labeled with this label.  They all become professionals.  Never before on television have we seen so many experts. <br>  Another important point - this is how the Internet is reflected in the entertainment programs.  Today you can watch TV programs without TV.  You turn on the computer and choose any program.  Perhaps this really means the end of a certain habit, but it concerns only the object, the addressee.  In the end, this behavior change did not go further.  Television has never been so strong: even those who do not like to sit in front of the TV can watch programs on the Internet, for example, in their bedroom, at any time convenient for themselves. <br>  - <b>What will be the television of tomorrow?</b>  <b>Now the Internet and television are often opposed to each other, but maybe, in the end, they simply merge?</b> <b><br></b> <br>  - It seems to me that the television of the future will consist of more and more specialized channels: everyone will watch their own channel, while large audiences will be attracted by major sporting and political events, which will be spent on broadcasting considerable funds. <br>  As for the merger, I would not count on such a prospect.  Each is an author in a particular field.  There will always be people who are engaged in television, and those who are engaged in the Internet. <br>  Cinema has not disappeared since the advent of television, and, therefore, with the Internet, things are exactly the same.  At the same time, the convergence of the object will certainly complicate the situation in the future.  The documentary presents you with serious information, and the humorous news on Canal + makes you laugh.  If tomorrow, it will be unclear to us who does what and what is what, the Internet or television, we will no longer trust anyone, and this will create a rich ground for rumors.  However, analyzing the media is very difficult.  First you need to study people, because they determine the trends.  Television and the Internet only reflect our intellectual level and its changes. </div>
