And exactly the same way I tried to find a suitable time management system.  These attempts led to the fact that I began to doubt the axioms of GTD, which I will try to discuss below. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Let's start, as they say, from the very roots of the problem.  Where did the "have gone" problem of lack of time? <br><br>  It's all pretty trite. <br>  First, people have created a number of tools that speed up work and facilitate it.  The man began to do more.  And he also began to charge more.  That is why time, paradoxically, was missed.

      Secondly, such a characteristic of work as ‚Äúmeasured‚Äù has completely disappeared.  By the way, read the word.  It very accurately defines the characteristics of the workflow.  Dimension disappeared in its literal expression - as an opportunity to divide work into separate ‚Äúmeasures‚Äù and do it gradually;  and in a figurative sense - more and more questions require a solution ‚Äúhere and now‚Äù, and they can‚Äôt wait. <br><br>  That is why we acquire all sorts of electronic devices that are designed to replace the workplace.  Although, you see, the very idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcarrying a desk and a computer with you looks pretty wild, but more and more people with stubbornness of maniacs want to work always and everywhere. <br><br>  In addition, there is a large number of techniques that are designed to help a person somehow rake up the vinaigrette in his head.  The adherents of these techniques urge us to write down everything, divide into categories and immediately rush to do this or that.  Depending on priorities. <br><br>  Any of these techniques ultimately boils down to the following steps: <br><ol><li>  Make a bunch of leaves (take a notebook / special system for a computer / something else for control and accounting); </li><li>  On each piece of paper, write down the task / project / work of a lifetime; </li><li>  Just above the tasks write different words on the sheets.  From "nafig not surrendered" to "must be done immediately !!!  (or prioritize in other convenient ways); " </li><li>  Put them in a pile; </li><li>  Meditate over the glass until enlightenment; </li><li>  After enlightenment, your efficiency will increase ... It will increase, I said! </li><li>  Congratulations, you are a time management guru! </li></ol><br>  Time management systems pay so much attention to the records that it becomes unclear whether there is anything in these systems besides keeping records ... <br><br>  There are only 2 tasks that can be solved with the help of records: <br><ol><li>  Reminder </li><li>  Systematization </li></ol><br>  The more complicated your recording system is, the greater the risk of slipping into procrastination.  That is, you will not do things, but endlessly review and organize their list.  This, of course, entertains, but does not contribute to the promotion of work.  Strictly speaking, the time management system should be such that its service does not turn into an independent task. <br><br>  While reading Allen's book, I was haunted by the feeling that part of the GTD system was not invented to make it easier for a person to do work, but simply because the author of the system was very fond of putting pieces of paper into cells. <br><br>  In addition, the thought does not leave me that some of Allen's original premises are incorrect initially, or, at a minimum, not as universal as the author wants. <br><br><h5>  Stress ‚â† thoughts about work </h5><br>  ‚ÄúGetting things done‚Äù begins with one assumption.  Say, any thought about work automatically means stress.  People think about work, think, and then become sorrowful in their minds and are not capable of hard capitalist labor. <br><br>  However, the assumption is false.  A person is not nervous when he thinks about work.  To make us lose peace can fears associated with sanctions for not doing the work in time, or with a lack of understanding of how to do this work.  These fears are many. <br><br>  But a person is never worried if he understands how to do work, if he has enough time to do it, and if he understands that his work will be rewarded.  What is interesting: GTD does not solve these fears in any way, if they do arise.  There is only one thing that helps to cope with them - a job change. <br><br><h5>  Unrecorded time  time lost </h5><br>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãtaking time into account is a rather strange thing.  I often hear: ‚ÄúHow can you senselessly spend so much time on X, when you can earn money at this time?‚Äù. <br><br>  In the end, we are not in accounting.  If all the time that is not included in our diary is considered lost, then we will reach the level of a manager from a famous anecdote about conducting with a brass band.  In it, I remind you, the manager demanded to reduce the brass band, not understanding why so many instruments are needed that perform the same part. <br><br>  The human brain works constantly, and not only when it is prescribed to him by the authorities.  Therefore, as Bruce Mau says, " <a href="http://www.designet.ru/education/career/%3Fid%3D16595">drink coffee, drive a taxi, breathe fresh air</a> ."  The muse is a capricious woman, and often comes in the morning, for breakfast, and not in the evening. <br><br>  In addition, adherents of 100% use of working time would like to wish to divide your day like this: 6 hours for sleep, 18 for work.  Not for procrastination on the Internet, namely, to work.  Then think how much time you can stretch like that, and what is the price of this. <br><br><h5>  Man - being a single task </h5><br>  You can charge yourself as much as you like, but you need to do things one by one.  Not a hundred cases at the same time, guided by a mountain of papers or records in the GTD-system.  It‚Äôs better to do one thing completely than to start a few.  First, the feeling of achievement (which, by the way, motivates) appears not when you started, but when you finished.  Secondly, you probably will not have to go back to this case. <br><br>  Multitasking is good only in computers.  In order to listen to music simultaneously with work.  A person needs to do things one by one.  Gradually.  Measured. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/89399/">https://habr.com/ru/post/89399/</a></p>
