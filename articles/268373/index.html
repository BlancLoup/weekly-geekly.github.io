Having implemented all our plans in it, we set about developing a <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/kontur.el-ba/id1004954700">version for iOS</a> , which recently appeared in the App Store.  A post about development using Xamarin.Forms will be later, but for now let's focus on a seemingly trivial matter: laying out the application on the App Store and talking to moderators. <br><br>  Let's start with the conclusions that we got in the process of communicating with the Apple moderators: <br><br><ul><li>  the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/">App Store Review Guidelines</a> should be carefully re-read: recommendations change, and what was allowed yesterday could be banned today; </li><li>  Apple moderators do not always carefully study the application and may miss content inside; </li><li>  you need to carefully read the responses of moderators; </li><li>  the solution after verification may not comply with the rules of the App Store.  An example in the text below: the requirement to connect in app purchase for an application without the support of paid features; </li><li>  in incomprehensible situations it is better to immediately write an appeal in order not to spend a week waiting for an answer.  If the answer is not satisfactory or incomprehensible - new appeals; </li><li>  moderation can take a long time: at least 8 days, of which 7 days - waiting in line for checking. </li></ul><br>  We present a log of communication with moderators with unexpected turns, investigations, total misunderstanding, but with a happy conclusion of the storyline. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  June 11 </h2><br>  Application development is complete, it remains to fix some bugs.  We deliberately sent to appruv <b>version 0.9</b> , which we were not going to show to users in order to first work out the moderation procedure and find out about inconsistencies with the guidelines.  Themselves at that time engaged in the correction of errors.

    <h2>  22nd of June </h2><br>  The application has moved from the ‚ÄúWaiting for validation‚Äù status to the ‚ÄúVerified‚Äù status. <br><br><h2>  June 23 </h2><br>  The status changed to ‚ÄúRequired information‚Äù, and a letter was received from technical support.  The most amazing questions and our answers: <br><br>  <b>Q:</b> Who is the target audience of the application? <br>  <b>A:</b> Small business of the Russian Federation.  The application allows you to create and print documents, as well as send them to counterparties. <br>  <b>Note:</b> The application description already contains this information. <br><br>  <b>Q:</b> Is this an existing service?  And if so, where is it available? <br>  <b>A:</b> Yes, existing service.  It is available at <a href="http://e-kontur.ru/">e-kontur.ru</a> .  The application has a link to it. <br>  <b>Note:</b> The question was probably asked without launching the application and reading its description, since  The link to the web service is contained inside and outside. <br><br>  <b>Q:</b> Is the application an integral part of the service or can the service work without an application? <br>  <b>A: A</b> service can work without an application, while an application can work limitedly without service and without the Internet at all: you can create documents without sending and viewing a print form. <br><br>  The following questions and answers related to the payment scheme, for example: <br><br>  <b>Q:</b> How does the user / company pay?  By subscription or one time?  What is the price, and how can I pay? <br>  <b>A: The</b> application can be used without payment - full functionality is available after registration within the application.  Without registration, you can create a maximum of 5 documents.  The service has paid options, but only for the user of the web version. <br><br>  <b>Q:</b> Is it possible to buy paid upgrades for an application outside the application? <br>  <b>A:</b> No. <br><br>  All of these (and subsequent, see the original) questions are rather standardized, so it‚Äôs not clear why not put them in the application description, the questionnaire before being sent to moderation so as not to slow down the process? <br><br>  We give the original letter and our answers in English under the spoiler.  I had to reformat the correspondence, because  after sending our answers look very unpleasant: for some reason, line breaks have disappeared.  The example in the screenshot: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e3a/450/d43/e3a450d434ac4c1f844036544fd39907.png"><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Letter from the App Store</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  We need you to make sure that you‚Äôve been able to do so. <br><br>  At your earliest opportunity, please read the following question and provide as much detailed information as you can.  You can complete your review. <br><br>  - Who is the target audience? <br>  - Is this an existing service?  If yes, where is it available? <br>  - Is it an app? <br>  - How does the user / company pay?  Is it subscription-based or one time fee?  What is the cost of payment? (Ex. Credit card, paypal, bank transfer, carrier billing, etc.)? <br>  - Does the user / company pay per device or user? <br>  - Is there an additional charge for mobile access? <br>  - Is there a paid upgrade option outside of the app? <br><br>  It is not necessary to upload a new binary.  Once you reply to the Resolution Center, we can proceed with your review. </div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Our answer</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Q: Who is the target audience? <br>  A: Russian small business.

Service have subscribe tariffs: <a href="http://www.e-kontur.ru/">www.e-kontur.ru/#prices</a> - but it is only for users of the web-version of service!  In this version, users can pay by credit cards (Yandex.Money, WebMoney, etc).

Total first approval took <b>19 days</b> .  It was not difficult, although the sample questions / answers were somewhat upset.  But as you remember, we sent a beta version.  So finish the release and go! <br><br><h2>  the 14 th of July </h2><br>  Sent to appruv <b>version 1.0</b> , start a new countdown.  This version is not functionally different from the previous one, just finished the bugs.  Nothing foreshadowed trouble ... <br><br><h2>  21 July </h2><br>  The application has moved from the ‚ÄúWaiting for validation‚Äù status to the ‚ÄúVerified‚Äù status. <br><br><h2>  July 22 </h2><br>  The application moved to the status ‚ÄúRejected‚Äù, which was unexpected for us.  The essence of the letter: <br><br><ol><li>  The description of the application contains a link to "external mechanisms for the purchase or subscription." </li><li>  The application has a registration function, which is considered an external mechanism for accessing paid purchases / subscriptions for an application. </li></ol><br>  On the same day, we replied that the application has a link to our website, but a subscription to the service does not affect the functionality of the application.  And this is true: in the web service in free mode you can create no more than 5 documents, and in the application there is no such restriction.  And this is not a bug, but a bonus for users of the mobile version :) <br><br>  But as you can see from our answer, we missed the registration question.  Our flaw, which was definitely worth the extra time ... <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Letter from the App Store</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Click here for a copy of the app, such as a "buy" button. <br><br>  Description of the app: <br>  <a href="http://www.e-kontur.ru/">www.e-kontur.ru</a> <br><br>  Please remove your URL that links to your App Description. <br><br>  Your app also includes an account registration feature.

Please remove this link. ‚Äù <br><br>  Here you should pay attention to an interesting point: we are talking only about the link in the description.  About the registration is not a word. <br><br>  In order not to continue one-way correspondence, we removed the link from the description and sent it for moderation. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Letter from the App Store</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  11.13 - This is a ‚Äúbuy‚Äù app, such as a "buy" button. <br>  Description of the appraisals <br><br>  <a href="http://www.e-kontur.ru/">www.e-kontur.ru</a> <br><br>  Please remove your URL that links to your App Description. <br></div></div><br><h2>  August 10 </h2><br>  The application has moved from the ‚ÄúWaiting for validation‚Äù status to the ‚ÄúVerified‚Äù status. <br><br><h2>  11th August </h2><br>  The application again switched to the status ‚ÄúRejected‚Äù. <br>  The essence of the answer: thanks for removing the link from the application description.

In addition, I was surprised by the remark about the lack of data for testing, because the interface contains an explanation: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/336/207/049/3362070491604a70b292a06ed5caff47.png"><br>  We sent an appeal through a special form: <a href="https://developer.apple.com/contact/app-store/%3Ftopic%3Dexpedite">developer.apple.com/contact/app-store/?topic=expedite.</a> And just in case, we added test login and password in the appropriate fields. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Letter from the App Store</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  For removing links from the Application Description. <br>  However, we‚Äôre not able to assess your app features. <br><br>  Please provide a demo account with details, including passwords, in the iTunes Connect app.  Please ensure your app features. <br>  To provide demo account information: <br><br>  - Log in to iTunes Connect <br>  - Click on ‚ÄúMy Apps‚Äù <br>  - Select your app <br>  - Scroll down to ‚ÄúApp Review Information‚Äù <br>  - Provide information in ‚ÄúDemo Account‚Äù and / or ‚ÄúNotes‚Äù as appropriate <br>  - Click Save <br>  - Click Submit for Review <br><br>  Additionally, we‚Äôve noticed that you‚Äôve seen the app.  Specifically, the app contains links to various app that exit app to Safari. <br><br>  You can indirectly provide access to these mechanisms, such as links to web sites. <br><br>  Resources <br>  It can be a convenient way to provide content purchasing functionality. <br><br>  In-App Purchase provides several benefits, including: <br>  - The flexibility to support a variety of business models. <br>  - Impacting your app rather than distributing them across multiple apps. <br>  - An effective marketing vehicle for new content. <br>  - The App Store Codes Program, which enables you to create high-value marketing campaigns for consumers.

We will be able to continue the investigation of our App. <br></div></div><br><h2>  12th of August </h2><br>  The answer to the appeal came quickly enough, the very next evening. <br><br>  Its essence is as follows: if something is bought on the site, even if it is not related to the application, such links cannot be put in the application.  Well, apparently it remains only to accept and remove the link. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">App Store Answer To Our Appeal</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  11.13 - This is a ‚Äúbuy‚Äù app, such as a "buy" button. <br><br>  Hello Dmitry, <br><br>  For your app, Contour.Elba. <br><br>  The App Review Your App Reviewed.

Probably the moderators did not check whether we fulfilled the requirements this time or not. <br><br>  For links to the site, you can take clickable labels like "More about Elbe", but they do not lead to the site, but to a page inside the application itself: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5c7/422/7a3/5c74227a3434463eaef4d6f26cf28f76.png"></div><br>  A misunderstanding occurred with the remark about the link to the external payment mechanism.  There is a registration in the application, but it does not lead to an external site: it‚Äôs just an opportunity to register or log in to synchronize documents through a third-party service to another phone / tablet.  Rechecking that free registration is not prohibited by the rules, we again wrote an appeal. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Letter from the App Store</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  11.13 Details <br><br>  Your app includes an account registration feature. <br><br>  Next Steps <br><br>  You can indirectly provide access to these mechanisms. <br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Our answer</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  We are slightly confused by your latest response.

Conclusions were made at the beginning of the article. <br><br>  Of the <b>43 days, a</b> third of the term went to the last stage of communication with the moderators - the requirements to include in app purchase in the application without purchases. <br><br><h1>  Afterword </h1><br>  The next update of the application with bug fixes and minor features was sent for moderation on September 17th.  Exactly <b>7 days</b> it was ‚Äúwaiting for verification‚Äù, <b>1 day was</b> checked, and, finally, on September 25, the update saw the light.  We still do not know what difficulties with checking the application lurk in the future :) <br><br>  If you have your own correspondence stories with moderators on controversial topics, tips or questions, we will be happy to discuss them in the comments to the article. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/268373/">https://habr.com/ru/post/268373/</a></p>
