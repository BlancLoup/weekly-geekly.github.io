      computer components and interesting gadgets; <br>  "Incredible ideas" (yes, what is there just do not come up); <br>  and for dessert - a selection of girls with Computex. <br><br>  We will start with the hotly debated new products: <br><br>  ASUS immediately introduced a couple of video cards long-awaited by overclockers and enthusiasts: <br><br>  MARS II is a combination of two GeForce GTX580 on a single PCB.  In fact, analog GeForce GTX590, but the frequency is much higher: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/a2038ea3/63899051/9cd78be0/3c037aa5.jpg"><br><br>  GeForce GTX580 Matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãa modified version of the GTX580 Direct CUII.  It would seem that there is no place to refine, the video card has already been invented, but ASUS engineers do not think so.  Enhanced power supply system and, for the first time, GPU voltage control buttons right on the PCB: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/41ca4626/470d2c61/1f030eb3/9ef799ae.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/740b14fe/711442b0/6b11bbe7/14657e49.jpg"><br><br>  MSI also showed an updated version of the GTX580 Lightning video card.  She received the Extreme Edition prefix, the color of the reverse switches changed to blue, and the video memory size grew from one and a half GB to three. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/940d48be/345af0a4/adedf05b/9f0f0e99.jpg"><br><br>  A big stir in the press caused the Intel X79 chipset.  The new LGA2011 connector will be announced in the fourth quarter of 2011, but according to rumors, the launch may be postponed to 2012.  The presented samples look mildly not ready even in terms of design.  And about their performance can also only guess. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/b69b9ba1/97a330c4/173784bc/7d042523.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/aed37351/ca6fa10d/27b63676/dca19259.jpg"><br><br>  The stand of the company Thermaltake collected an incredible amount of products.  The Level 10 GT enclosures alone were: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/af42ae49/57f448cd/60f11279/913acaa1.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/7817bead/3db89fb8/a3ee21c9/3aa69a91.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/bcb15fa3/7198f1c2/4ea0fcbb/572ffecb.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/dbea5ad3/e6e41eb2/1708ef92/a6c0ea79.jpg"><br><br>  I admit honestly that the modding project of this corps struck me very much.  In Russia and Ukraine, modders have to refine the necessary parts or create them from scratch.  A project executed by a Chinese modder is more like a factory job.  And the level of its implementation is beyond praise. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/c2894a8f/0c86b452/010972a6/f127094d.jpg"><br><br>  This year, along with the Level 10GT case, the ToughPower Grand power supplies have won the prestigious reddot design 2011 design award. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/aa24bb59/f910bf6d/91ef5414/ac93dbe6.jpg"><br><br>  And at the Geil booth, you can see one of the most successful 1200-watt Thunderbolt power supplies, my interest in it is caused not only by its high power, but also by an additional panel in the kit that allows you to monitor in direct mode not only all the voltages along the lines, but also consumed power system. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/de80fc4f/c62f7f16/db2f657c/8c4a37f0.jpg"><br><br>  Memory for the Intel P67 chipset is represented by the Corsa line.  The main feature of this kit is to support the frequency of 2200 MHz.  For 4-gigabyte memory modules, this is a very good indicator. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/0c3ca893/5f5ab282/5c705251/487521c9.jpg"><br><br>  And the cooling system for those who like colder: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/94169844/0ef044b1/ecd14a02/26472d73.jpg"><br><br>  I have repeatedly noticed that with the imagination of the Russian people everything is very good, but the implementation is constantly failing.  At the exhibition we met a lot of interesting ideas not only in terms of technology, but also in terms of visualization of the demonstration stand.  True, in my opinion, for the most part they are useless, and I really want to ask the creators: ‚Äúwhy?‚Äù <br><br>  For example, the ice case: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/0383b85c/093304d0/8a981689/02ef0418.jpg"><br><br>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãvisualization is undoubtedly one of the best, but what exactly these guys demonstrate for me remains a mystery.  After all, on their stand, besides the walls, there are only two blocks of ice: one with the name of the company and the second with this frozen body. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/190c7258/4d704229/276e72db/2c554d72.jpg"><br><br>  And this is an adapter for DDR3 RAM.  Communication with the stand employee was stumped after answering the question: ‚ÄúWhat does this adapter do?‚Äù.  The answer just hit us: "No function".  As a result, we managed to find out that this adapter can be useful for people who often change memory, use different kits.  Inserting and removing memory, you can damage the contact tracks, the adapter is intended to protect them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/ffecbb7b/8adebb86/5a93c54a/711d6e17.jpg"><br><br>  People from the stand in the form of the sea ship showed unexpected care to the needs of the modern user.  They created a case in which you can assemble two systems at once.  The first, as explained, is needed for games.  And second, it may be Atom or something like that, it is necessary for working with simple applications.  Why I can not use the first system for all needs, I did not understand. <br><br>  Well, a selection of girls: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/0f84d558/c4cfb719/c55f3bac/bef1e7dd.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/4d680ba6/f2afefbe/5991639f/01a80645.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/ebdb91c8/7732762e/022dd188/e64201ce.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/35a58431/ca4cc62e/9b4843ce/ea1754dd.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/8d2bb8b6/7c09a699/512777eb/09931222.jpg"><br><br>  And, of course, Intel with a clear demonstration of the multi-core era :) <br><br>  Look for a big report on the pages <a href="http://www.i-zine.ru/">of i magazine</a> after returning from the exhibition. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/aa3235fb/9b9191f1/412f1057/e5b06813.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/120410/">https://habr.com/ru/post/120410/</a></p>
