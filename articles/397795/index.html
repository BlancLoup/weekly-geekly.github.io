  <section class="page js-page"><h1>IBM Watson helps to "wise up" consumer electronics</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/737/bdf/597/737bdf5978214ee5ac3c5530281a02c8.jpg"><br><br>  Our company is confident that modern household appliances can work even better.  It's no secret that many devices are now equipped with chips that allow such systems to become part of the ‚ÄúInternet of things‚Äù.  Well, if so, then the possibilities of household appliances are becoming more versatile. <br><br>  Smart technology will become even smarter if you teach it to work with <a href="http://www.ibm.com/watson/watson-oncology.html">IBM Watson</a> .  And this is not just thinking out loud, but a project that is already being implemented.  Our company began cooperation in this direction with such well-known manufacturers of household appliances, smart home systems like Whirlpool, Bragi, Withings, Panasonic.  New device models of these companies are able to interact not only with a person, but also with each other.  How?  Let's get a look. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Whirpool </h3><br>  Whirpool produces high-quality refrigerators, washing machines, kitchen equipment.  But now the Whirpool washing machines have become smarter.  For example, some new models of ‚Äúwasher‚Äù can not only suggest to the owner which washing program should be used for clothes and linen of different types, but also exchange data with the dryer of the same company.  The data transmitted by the washing machine allows the dryer to work optimally. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      The cognitive system in this case analyzes the data on how users exploit the washing and drying machines (of course, if the user gives permission to transmit such information).  As a result, company engineers can use the data to improve devices. <br><br><h3>  Panasonic </h3><br>  Panasonic also leverages the capabilities of the Watson cognitive system.  In this case, the system provides the capabilities of its speech processing service. <br><br>  One of the areas where Panasonic works with IBM Watson is security systems.  These are surveillance cameras, motion detectors, vibration detectors, etc.  The cognitive system collects data about incidents that result in a security system.  This may be penetration into a house or apartment, or maybe a flight to a section of an ordinary ball. <br><br>  Thanks to IBM Watson, the security system identifies the child of a neighbor who climbed over the fence, came for his ball, and did not turn on the alarm.  But if an unknown person hit the plot or the house, the security system ‚Äúhits all the bells‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b57/d2b/927/b57d2b927104412a97454346e3073f6f.png"><br><br><h3>  Nokia </h3><br>  The Finnish company, after selling its mobile phone division, decided to start creating smart wearable devices.  This is mainly done by the Nokia division, Withings (the Finns acquired it not so long ago). <br><br>  In addition to smart watches, Nokia produces smart wearable gadgets for the elderly.  Such gadgets let you know if a person deviates from the usual route, behaves unusually or does not perform any actions for a long time. <br><br>  The IBM Watson cognitive system in this case can help such devices and related services work even more efficiently.  In addition, Nokia is currently developing voice control interfaces for the smart home.  All this, and smart trackers, and systems like "smart home" can be linked together. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWearable devices, smart gadgets and voice interfaces are a new word in healthcare and caring for older people and patients who need care,‚Äù said a representative of GM at Nokia Health.  ‚ÄúThanks to IBM Watson, we can link all these devices and systems into a single, reliable, fast network in which data is transmitted in the blink of an eye.‚Äù <br><br>  Nokia wants to use the capabilities of the Withings instruments as part of the project ‚ÄúAging in place‚Äù (‚Äúhelping the elderly at home‚Äù), as well as to monitor the use of drugs by patients. <br><br><h3>  Bragi </h3><br>  Bragi was the first company in the world to create smart wireless headphones that can work as a fitness tracker with advanced features.  The most famous headphone model of this company, Bragi Dash, is equipped with 27 sensors.  These sensors allow headphones to collect detailed data about the health and activity of the user. <br><br>  Bragi plans to use its expertise to improve the quality of life of its customers.  IBM Watson in this case helps to recognize the voice commands that give users Bragi Dash.  The company hopes with the help of our cognitive system to ensure that, for example, colleagues at work can easily interact with each other.  In this case, Bragi Dash can transmit voice information, automatically determine the location of employees, help organize the work process. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b6f/6b2/e75/b6f6b2e757a9450d9b5f4255e2b0b218.png"><br><br>  ‚ÄúWearable devices will change the way they work.  Already, they have a huge impact on business processes, ‚Äùsays the founder of Bragi. <br><br>  In general, the ‚ÄúInternet of things‚Äù is really able to change our life for the better, making it more convenient and comfortable.  A cognitive system IBM Watson can significantly accelerate the development of IoT-sphere, ensuring the transition from quantity to quality. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/397795/">https://habr.com/ru/post/397795/</a></p>
