  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Who is Brian Krzhanich, the new director of Intel?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f90/6e6/79c/f906e679c75a278bbab6062eb939503a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On Thursday, Intel announced that it had chosen a successor for the outgoing director, Paul Otellini, who had become the company's former executive director, Brian Krzhanich, <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/5/2/4293494/who-is-brian-krzanich-intels-new-ceo">writes</a> The Verge.  Otellini has led Intel since 2005, but six months ago announced his intention to resign this month.  Krzhanich will take over the reins of the computer giant already on May 16.  But who is this Krzhanich, and what to expect from Intel under its control? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Krzhanich spent most of his career at Intel, starting working for the company as early as 1982 as a process engineer.  He moved up the career ladder at Intel‚Äôs manufacturing units until he was appointed executive director of the company in January 2012.  Managing production, he was actively engaged in factories and supply chains, eventually increasing output and reducing company costs.  He also participated in Intel's investment in third-party companies and in the transition to more efficient processor manufacturing. <br><br>  Otellini was at one time much criticized for his lack of engineering experience.  Krzhanich is unlikely to face such criticism, since he began work in the company as an engineer, but he faces other problems.  The transition of dominance in the computer industry from desktops to mobile devices has a bad effect on the company's balance: in the last quarter, profits fell by 25%.

      Despite numerous attempts to break into the mobile processor market - currently owned by Qualcomm and Nvidia - Intel has so far failed to replicate its success with desktop processors.  To maintain its growth, Intel is not only betting on mobile devices: the company promised to launch an Internet TV service with a set-top box by the end of this year.  Intel is trying to cover all areas of new technology, and may well become successful in eliminating the dominance of cable companies. <br><br>  But skeptics are not sure that Krzhanich is a new type of Intel executive.  Back in November, Cromwell Shubart from the Silicon Valley Business Journal predicted that Krzhanich would become the director of Intel, and noted that this move would maintain the status quo in the company.  Intel was looking for candidates both outside and inside the company, but in the end a safe bet was made on its person, who probably will not make drastic changes and will keep Intel on the same course as the last couple of years. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/178667/">https://habr.com/ru/post/178667/</a></p>
