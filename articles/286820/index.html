  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Love your subordinates, or "How to keep employees"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  According to statistics, 34% of all layoffs of their own accord occur because of ‚Äúthey don't like me here, they don't appreciate me‚Äù.  What does this mean?  Do we have to love our subordinates?  And the most interesting - what does it mean to ‚Äúlove your subordinates‚Äù? <br><br>  You manage the project, and you have several programmers in the team, or maybe you are the head of a small department or just a mentor?  You probably have your own idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow to manage your subordinates: someone is strict, someone is soft, someone appreciates for the result, and someone builds a competent process.  And we all aim to ensure that the slave worked as efficiently as possible.  Everyone knows the method of "carrot and stick" - praise for the good work and blame for the bad.  And there is a perception that there is no better reward than money.  But it is not.  Rather, not quite. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In order to warn in advance all the questions and disagreements on this matter, I will say that, of course, money is a ‚Äúhygienic‚Äù motivational factor.  Without money, you can hardly find many enthusiasts to spend 8 hours a day on you.  But money is not everything. <br><br>  You can certainly add a couple of thousand as a bonus for good work, the employee will be delighted (although ... <s>‚ÄúHmm, just a couple of thousand, you could give more ... That‚Äôs how I appreciate here‚Äù</s> ), but there are other ways that will be less costly for you, but will bring good results.

    <h4>  Thanks </h4><br>  Do you often say thank you to your subordinates? <br>  They do what they have to, but this does not mean that they do not deserve thanks. <br>  Do you often say thanks to your assistant for helping you, facilitating your work, saving you time?  I bet that many of you have not even thought about it. <br><br>  The fact is that as soon as you said thank you, all the work done became important! <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúHey, you're a class teacher, thank you, that 8 hours a day you answer mail and coordinate these boobies!‚Äù</i> <br><br>  Imagine that your manager (director, CEO - well, who is there above you) told you this. <br><br>  In fact, he did nothing, but you were pleased.  You immediately felt "not in vain." <br>  Try starting with a thank you.  Just thank your subordinates for what they are supposed to do. <br><br>  But love is not limited to gratitude alone. <br><br><h4>  Praise </h4><br>  How to praise the employee?  What is worth praise?  Of course, we are all accustomed to praise for the result.  But what does the result mean?  Completed and completed project?  Each subtask of this project?  The employee achieves small achievements more often than you think.  ‚ÄúBut not to praise him for every written letter!‚Äù - and that is true.  Praise should be dosed: so it is more valuable.  But for what to praise? <br>  Think, for what you appreciate this employee?  Violations of what would not suffer?  How is it different from others? <br>  <i>‚ÄúHe comes on time every time‚Äù</i> is great, praise for it, if not all can boast of such punctuality, but this is important to you. <br>  <i>‚ÄúHe always responds quickly to customers‚Äù</i> - if this is the most efficient operator for technical support, praise him! <br>  <i>‚ÄúHe himself proposes solutions, but does not ask me how to do it,‚Äù</i> praise the initiative.  It makes your job easier, saves your time! <br><br>  Also, do not forget to notice the positive changes that you see, to consolidate them, to let the employee know that this is what you are expecting from him. <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúThis time he wrote the report on Friday, as it should, and not on Monday, as always,‚Äù</i> praise him for it. <br><br>  It works as a reflex: I am praised, which means that I need to do something for which I am praised, to be praised more.  On the one hand, it is cynical ... But on the other hand, we are all dependent on praise.  We all want love.  Therefore it works. <br><br>  How to praise? <br><br>  Be sure to say what you praise for.  Otherwise, after several times the word "well done" will be perceived insincerely.  You can praise so: <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúYou are very cool today talked with the client.</i>  <i>Feels professionalism and experience! "</i> <br>  <i>‚ÄúI saw that you completed the task ahead of time - cool!</i>  <i>It turned out great!</i>  <i>Will you do the same thing next time? ‚Äù</i> <br>  <i>‚ÄúYou have great presentations!</i>  <i>Always so bright, colorful.</i>  <i>I am proud that you are in our team! ‚Äù</i> <br><br>  Well, the most basic, probably what is in love, is ... <br><br><h4>  Understanding </h4><br>  Try to understand your employees.  Why he does not do what I want from him?  Why doesn't he seem to hear me ?! <br>  <i>‚ÄúHe must be a bad worker ‚Äî maybe dismiss him?‚Äù</i> <br>  Or maybe you are a bad leader? <br><br>  We are all different.  And all of us, surprisingly, despite the fact that we speak Russian, we speak differently.  We put different meanings in words. <br>  For example, I will tell you: <br><br>  <i>"You are not enough initiative."</i> <br><br>  What can this mean?  Perhaps you need to be more attentive to customers?  And maybe, more often and in more detail to report on the work done?  Or take more tasks?  Although it is possible that you talk a little with colleagues.  And in fact, I could have in mind that I would like you to undertake the organization of internal events ... Well, why not? <br><br>  If you have ever used a translator, you probably have seen that one word can have a lot of meanings and synonyms.  ‚ÄúLearning‚Äù is so simple in Russian, but in English, for example, note: <br>  teach - to teach someone <br>  learn - learn something. <br><br>  And "watch"?  Look, see, view, watch! <br><br>  Approximately the same and we.  We say a word, putting our understanding in it.  And another person perceives the same word through the prism of his own understanding.  And the meaning can be very distorted.  Therefore, to avoid hasty conclusions, make sure that the ‚Äútranslation‚Äù of your thoughts took place correctly and the employee understood you correctly! <br>  Go to the question from different angles.  Give examples.  Explain the reasons for your comments.  Find out exactly how the person understood you. <br><br>  <i>You should love your subordinates to stay with you, to work better, more efficiently.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Thank them to make them feel needed.</i>  <i>To praise them so that they know why they are valued.</i>  <i>Try to understand them in order to speak the same language with them.</i> <br><br>  Now I am sure that you understood me correctly. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/286820/">https://habr.com/ru/post/286820/</a></p>
