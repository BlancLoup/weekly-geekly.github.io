Too much weight.  Netbooks are too simple and are suitable, perhaps, for students and schoolchildren.  Ultrabooks - a good solution, but their weight still, as a rule, exceeds more than one kilogram.  And the price bites.  Can an ordinary tablet computer become a full replacement and provide the necessary versatility, provide a respectable look and at the same time not burden the burden, and the wallet, on the contrary, not facilitate? <br>  Perhaps under all these categories fit the Fujitsu Stylistic M532.  Let's try to figure it out. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d46/080/385/d46080385564ab7223ce1c5902b6bbd4.jpg"><br>  Attention, traffic. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Complete set and appearance </h4><br>  So, open the box.  Warranty cards, brief instructions that fit on one sheet, the power supply and, in fact, Stylistic M532 itself.

      Tablet PC Fujitsu Stylistic M532 is positioned as a business tablet.  It has a strict design and is made in black.  The thickness of the device is 8.6 mm with a weight of 560 g.  If you look at the reviews of the first users on the Internet, many have already noted the thin body of the Stylistic M532.  Due to this, he not only comfortably lies in his hand, but also takes up little space in his briefcase / bag.  Almost like a folder with documents. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4c4/a0d/fda/4c4a0dfda8890bd6a295906e2d12b444.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/081/e2a/024/081e2a024ff324a18bd418bbf8b5d175.jpg"><br><br>  When choosing a mobile assistant, the build quality plays a significant role.  If for a laptop it is not so critical, then in the case of the tablet tactile sensations play an important role.  Any backlash, sharp edges or mediocre plastic are noticed almost immediately and in the future cause only irritation of the user.  In regards to Stylistic, the M532 approached this meticulously.  Everything is verified, tailored and manufactured to the conscience.  To hold the device in hand is a pleasure.  The only negative is that the light sensor is located in the upper right corner and is often closed by hand.  For this reason, sometimes the device incorrectly sets the screen brightness level. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0a4/e30/578/0a4e30578050a57774e27bbe5ea893bf.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/aea/996/a2e/aea996a2e42afacbf2d75817ea0e593d.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Display </h4><br>  The screen diagonal is 25.7 cm (10.1 inches), the resolution is 1280x800, the TFT-matrix provides comfortable viewing angles.  The backlight is quite smooth, without any blackout.  By the way, the widescreen screen is convenient not only when watching movies, but also when working with some programs, since landscape orientation provides additional space for the menu. <br><br>  On the network there are complaints about the not quite accurate operation of the touch screen.  Also naughty browsers.  Most of the time Firefox delivers.  When the screen orientation changes, rendering is often incorrect.  However, these and some other problems are not connected with the device, but with the operating system.  Stylistic M532 went on sale from Android 4.0, when updating the firmware to a newer version of Jelly Bean, most problems are solved. <br><br><h4>  Wireless communications </h4><br>  After examining the exterior of the device, check its interpersonal skills. <br>  The tablet is able to communicate with the outside world through all popular means.  Already only wireless Wi-Fi network is more than enough to access the World Wide Web.  The benefit of free points now you can find in any city.  And the AzureWave AW-AH663 chip works with all popular 802.11 standards.  As they say, from A to N. The level of reception can not be called outstanding.  Many laptops keep the connection more confident, but in the case of a fairly light and thin tablet PC this can be called a good result. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ff9/462/952/ff94629521a5e96c5d209fae7db1e74f.jpg"><br><br>  If you have to spend a lot of time on the road, then, of course, the use of 3G / UMTS cellular networks will be useful.  Everything is simple here: it is enough to buy a regular SIM card. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cbf/9b8/7ee/cbf9b87ee9715b8c8fdab6b8b149f9ab.jpg"><br><br>  Connecting to a computer via ordinary Micro-USB.  Once connected, the user is free to do whatever he pleases with the files: copy to or from the tablet.  Additionally, something to install on a PC is not required. <br><br><h4>  Nutrition </h4><br>  A few words about the power supply, which is also adapted for traveling around the world.  It allows the use of nozzles of different standards, which will eliminate the need for adapters.  Includes two forks.  Type C, which is used in Russia, and type G, whose homeland is the United Kingdom. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/578/057/dae/578057daee1e42a67a14c72ee98df0af.jpg"><br><br>  By the way, for charging is used not micro-USB, but a unique connector.  Some users in the Global Web mark this as one of the drawbacks of the device, as it creates unnecessary trouble.  However, the use of such a connector is due to the fact that for the Stylistic M532 a docking station is optionally available. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bd7/d30/2fe/bd7d302fefdbf96ef7687b79c2dacf9c.jpg"><br><br>  A cradle is purchased separately.  On it, the user has two USB, HDMI, and audio connectors.  This allows you to turn a simple tablet almost into a stationary computer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0b7/d51/034/0b7d51034fcbaac340fc3f5307b572a6.jpg"><br><br>  Battery life at a decent level.  Over 6 hours of HD movie playback with Wi-Fi enabled.  For testing, the MKV file was used compressed with the H.264 codec with a resolution of 1024x576 and a bitrate of 2950 Kbps.  It turns out that during this time you can have time to watch 4 films of average duration. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1ff/bb8/cf0/1ffbb8cf0dec2a9dc0c6ae44f56c6d26.png"><br><br>  In the benchmark AnTuTu Tester, the battery lasted for 155 minutes at one hundred percent system load.  According to the program, this corresponds to 467 points.  The index is quite good, though not a record.  But again, it is worth remembering that the manufacturer fit the battery with a capacity of 3170 mAh. <br>  If we talk about everyday use, then the full charge is more than enough for the whole day with Wi-Fi enabled and work on the Web and office applications. <br><br><h4>  Software </h4><br>  Adjust the operating system to fit your needs is not difficult.  In the Play Market you can find almost everything you need.  And naturally the question arises, how much is the tablet ready for change, or rather, what is the volume of the hard disk.  In the younger version of the model (32 GB), 26.5 GB is provided for the user's needs.  And, of course, you can increase the capacity through microSD.  Officially supported memory cards up to 32 GB. <br><br>  A selection of applications for different occasions is pre-installed in his memory.  For example, ThinkFree Office Pro is a convenient and functional program for working with documents, spreadsheets and presentations.  All popular formats are supported.  Including the new Microsoft extensions - docx, xlsx, pptx.  Moreover, interaction with online file storage services is implemented here: ThinkFree Online, Box.net and, most importantly, Google Drive. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/93d/096/cc3/93d096cc3d8d5a1c4160209963d9875e.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/71a/45a/319/71a45a3194b83f1f392d391ade16bbbe.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/066/d23/8e1/066d238e1d1142054ae194ce1e339892.png"><br><br>  In order to navigate through local files easier, the hard disk is already ‚ÄúES Explorer‚Äù.  This program is even better than the well-known Total Commander.  In addition to its direct responsibilities, it allows you to work with the network, FTP, and also has in its kit utilities for diagnosing and configuring the tablet PC. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ae8/d92/78f/ae8d9278f6c20e604f2723fe164652cf.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/90f/168/cef/90f168cefcbb851e552a9029be77c8c7.png"><br><br>  Special attention to work in corporate networks.  Here you can note TouchDown for SmartPhones, which allows you to customize the work with the Exchange server.  There are also two applications for virtualization: Citrix Receiver and VMware View. <br><br><h4>  Security </h4><br>  Included with the device is offered antivirus from Symantec.  The Norton Mobile Security app is licensed for one year.  It checks not only files on the media and SD-card, but also when visiting websites. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/09d/9d2/673/09d9d2673179cbd2844436f2fb4a574a.png"><br><br>  And since we are talking about security ... Unfortunately, it is impossible to exclude such force majeure as loss or theft of the device.  But if it stores a lot of important data that is not intended for others' eyes, then this becomes a big problem.  Of course, you need to set encryption and password.  It is also possible to control the tablet remotely using AbsoluteSoftware product.  The program allows you to know its location (coordinates are determined using GPS).  If you do not return the missing Stylistic M532, you can lock the device and also completely remove data from it. <br><br><h4>  Performance </h4><br><br>  Cause time, but also fun hour.  Onboard NVIDIA Tegra 3 T30S with a quad-core ARM Cortex A9 processor operating at a frequency of 1.4 GHz.  Delivers data for processing 1 GB DDR2 RAM.  Such a set is enough to while away the time for the games.  Such a set is enough to while away the time for games designed specifically for Tegra chips.  Interesting developments are becoming more and more.  For now, the number of products with 3D graphics optimized for Tegra is not too much.  Because the main entertainment - cinema.  Playing movies in HD-quality does not cause any difficulties for a tablet PC.  The power of the system is enough for this task. <br><br>  Performance, however, after some time after using the tablet drops significantly.  Some of the users on the Internet point this out as one of the flaws.  And if the tests still show normal operation, then the user's eye immediately clings to annoying jerks even in the most simple applications.  It is likely that in this case the error lies in the software.  We hope in the next updates these minor bugs will also be eliminated. <br><br><h4>  Multimedia </h4><br>  Naturally, Android knows how to handle video and music, but just in case there is PowerDVD Mobile aboard the Stylistic M532.  And do not be confused by the name.  The program recognizes not only video, but also graphic and audio files. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/69c/66d/5d4/69c66d5d4d3c3307d1612d934d11abde.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c2a/463/66e/c2a46366e105650c8117da186f5ff528.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/45c/dbd/09d/45cdbd09d8784da96ec1cc317b62d114.jpg"><br><br>  Speaking of vocal.  It is clear that for many devices it is enough to use high-quality headphones in order to enjoy the music or pass the time for an interesting movie.  But Stylistic M532, among other things, has two speakers on the back side.  Their sound, of course, can not be with a good stereo system, but will easily give odds to most budget speakers. <br><br><h4>  Results </h4><br>  Fujitsu Stylistic M532 is the most optimized for work: from the iron filling and to the programs that come with it.  Under certain conditions, even a seemingly simple tablet will become a comfortable working machine.  For example, when using the docking station.  However, nothing human is alien to him - all sorts of entertainment for every taste from music to modern games.  The price, by the way, is also very democratic.  At the time of writing, the average cost in stores in Moscow was about 15 thousand rubles.  Thus, the device can be affordable for the student. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/180607/">https://habr.com/ru/post/180607/</a></p>
