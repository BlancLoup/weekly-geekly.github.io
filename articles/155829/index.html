  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Overview of TP-Link MR3040 Mobile Router</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  At work, I need Internet access in the field - in the car, at the address, sitting on the roof ... At one time, I bought a laptop with an integrated Intel 5150 card, supporting networks using WiFi and WiMax technology and allowing to switch between modes with three clicks.  But then the change came and WiMax was replaced by LTE, which in the early days worked just disgustingly.  Therefore, urgently had to find a replacement, the benefit of a six-month subscription ended.  The dual 3G / LTE Huawei E392 modem was chosen, but the experience with the USB modem, waiting for it to be detected by the machine and the speed of link elevation left much to be desired.  The built-in solution could wait for a long time, but I want to work with comfort right now.  Therefore, a mobile wifi router with a battery and USB modem support TP-Link MR3040 was purchased on e-bay.  About which I want to tell now. <br>  Photos with the horizon littered, taken on the fridge - inside.  Weigh is not much, but on the mobile - neat. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I have to say that buying in Hong Kong and shipping to St. Petersburg cost me the same price as buying a similar device here.  It so happened that this lot caught my eye and the thought occurred that it was necessary to acquire such a router. <br>  The package arrived in less than three weeks.  The box was completely intact and not even dented. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/327/756/efc/327756efc4012beedf00be8a181f4499.jpg"><br><br>  On the side of the box, the manufacturer described the purpose of connectors and buttons, and also tried to boast a battery life of 4-5 hours.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7c8/f02/d61/7c8f02d61820f326521ba1b7bd0d2afc.jpg"><br><br>  But we are interested in the content.  Open the white box and see a white router under the transparent cover. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/945/acd/e2c/945acde2c267268be42d8ce7077d553c.jpg"><br><br>  Under the carton with the device lies the rest of the delivery, which, according to the plan, should be enough to start full-fledged work: a power adapter with a British plug (Hong Kong was a colony of Great Britain before the end of the 20th century), an adapter for a European plug, a USB cable -&gt; MicroUSB for Charging (a convenient solution that allows you to charge both from the outlet, and from any device with a USB output), as well as a short, 30-40 centimeters, network patchcord from a flat cable.  There was also a 2000 mAh battery, but by the time of the photo shoot he had already settled inside the router.  Why this kit is not enough - read on. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3a9/2a1/5c8/3a92a15c8faad5e830096d9c9756a5e8.jpg"><br><br>  On one side of the device there is a power switch and a charging connector, this connector has no more functionality. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/37b/0a7/9bb/37b0a79bb48ddeb96fb57eb6089e167a.jpg"><br><br>  From the end there is a USB connector, FastEthernet, a hole with a reset button and a small arrow telling you where to pull the cover to get to the compartment with the battery.  The lid is shaky, it opens very uncomfortable - constantly afraid to break the plastic hooks that do not look very reliable.  Often it is not necessary to open it, therefore excusable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/aea/f82/c09/aeaf82c09af627b3e1343361df95959b.jpg"><br><br>  The router itself has quite pocket dimensions, approximately with a pack of cigarettes, but thinner.  The body is completely made of glossy white plastic, with the exception of end inserts. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/51a/6a9/494/51a6a94943947c200536da2dc5ab7a5a.jpg"><br><br>  On the upper side there are 4 LEDs: Internet connection, WiFi activity, Ethernet and power. <br>  When turned on, they light up green, when charging the power indicator glows orange when the battery sits down - red, and when the battery is ready to die this minute - all 4 blink. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/29f/252/a5d/29f252a5da8a1f7acba797b4b11d3309.jpg"><br><br>  And now about what was missing in the starter kit.  The whole complex of the router and the modem connected to it has a completely indecent length and makes one fear both of them for mechanical safety.  In addition, the modem and router status indicators are on opposite sides. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/326/f9b/b9b/326f9bb9b06a6c056c7b94a721762732.jpg"><br><br>  Apparently, the engineers imagined these problems, but they could have put a short USB-cord right away, they would not have lost much, and the user is more comfortable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bc7/eed/ff8/bc7eedff8673a6b646ef26366f83ed6e.jpg"><br><br>  As for the admin - it is standard for most routers, except for the Operation Mode <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0d8/138/6dd/0d81386ddbffa25497de65c92741f20b.png"><br><br>  When you first start, you are offered a choice of mode: a router can use a modem as an Internet source and distribute it over WiFi, share a wired connection, be a simple access point (radio extension) or receive WiFi from a provider and distribute it also for the internal network - the so-called WISP Client Router <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/337/d0e/43b/337d0e43b699640c6e809a0ef68d1a5b.png"><br><br>  Also, the router can communicate with the provider via cable, but keep 3G in reserve and vice versa: the main will be the mobile Internet, and the reserve will be a link via cable.  Nobody forbids to choose the first option, for which the router was bought - to distribute from the modem. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/78d/764/64b/78d76464b5ab3a87568bd0f9151348c3.png"><br><br>  3G / 4G settings are quite simple: the choice of the region and the provider, the connection mode - on request, automatically and manually.  With a 4G MegaFon modem, it worked immediately and without dancing with a tambourine. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/81b/249/19c/81b24919c781f75fcd5b1f28a3d30ff4.png"><br><br>  On the router is the latest firmware version 120822, which can be picked up on the <a href="http://www.tp-link.com/en/support/download/%3Fmodel%3DTL-MR3040%26version%3DV1">official website.</a>  It differs from the previous one, at a minimum, by advanced WiFi encryption settings.  Since the device was changed immediately - there are no screenshots of the old firmware.  No one expected to see a reduction in speed compared to working with a modem directly.  it all comes down to the provider‚Äôs options and tariffs: sitting at work, I get 8 megabits of 4G from a tariff limited to 10 megabits. <br>  Now about the sad.  Tales of 4-5 hours of battery life in real conditions turned out to be fairy tales.  Perhaps such a time can be achieved if you distribute the wired Internet over WiFi (why buy a router with batteries when connected to a cable?), But with USB modems, it seems to me impossible.  Even after giving a discount on the gluttony of a 4G monster, which heats up no worse than a griddle and worked for an hour and a half from the built-in battery.  With the usual "deer", it seems to me, the battery will not last more than three. <br>  I'll try to summarize. <br>  <b>Pros:</b> <br><ul><li>  low price (about $ 50 or 1500 rubles) </li><li>  full-featured admin with all the features of modern routers </li><li>  sensible design, both aesthetically and functionally </li><li>  easy setup </li><li>  standard microUSB cable for charging </li></ul><br><br>  <b>Minuses:</b> <br><ul><li>  short battery life </li><li>  lack of clear indication of battery charge level </li><li>  Marked case, snow-white plastic is not very practical </li><li>  flimsy battery compartment cover (it is doubtful that people will drop in there until the death of the ‚Äútenant‚Äù) </li><li>  no USB dad / usb-mother adapter for modem connection </li></ul><br><br>  Do not hit with your feet, try to answer questions in the comments. <br>  Hubs are available only profile, in the "Devices for geeks" moderators can transfer? <br><br>  UPD I forgot the most important advantage: you can connect a phone and a tablet and a laptop, and even a TV to the router.  And it will be one SIM card and one payment for all devices. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/155829/">https://habr.com/ru/post/155829/</a></p>
