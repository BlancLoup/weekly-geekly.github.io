Do you suggest something?  - No, thanks, I'm just looking.  Need a bag?  - No, thanks, I'm with her. <br><br>  It is important to say ‚Äúno‚Äù in business communication.  One of our native speaker teachers, William, previously worked as a project manager in America and put together a selection of tips on how to say no and not ruin business relationships. <br><br><h2>  We say "no" in English </h2><br>  We now turn to ways to say no. <br><blockquote>  I'd rather not, thanks. </blockquote>  Thank you, but I will refuse.

I'm afraid I can't.  I'm afraid </blockquote>  All these sentences can be translated as ‚Äúsorry, but I can‚Äôt‚Äù or ‚Äúvery sorry, but have to be refused.‚Äù <br><br><blockquote>  I am not sure we can make it. </blockquote>  Not sure what we will do. <br><br><blockquote>  I'll have to think about it.  Thanks for asking. </blockquote>  Thanks for asking.  But it still needs to be thought about. <br><br><blockquote>  To be honest, I have another set of priorities this time. </blockquote>  To be honest, I have other priorities now. <br><br><blockquote>  I think I'll leave it.  Thank you. </blockquote>  Probably have to give up.  But thanks. <br><br><blockquote>  May not be suitable for me. </blockquote>  Not sure if this suits me. <br><br><blockquote>  I really need this time. </blockquote>  I do not like to say no, but this time I just have to. <br><br><h2>  How not to spoil business relations </h2><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ca/sl/55/casl55jtm5srvgprph7psvsfb44.png"></div><br>  On the advice of all that William, our carrier, there are a number of principles that should be followed when communicating with foreign colleagues: <br><br><ul><li>  negative words should be avoided and not used directly; </li><li>  it is better to replace negative words with positive wording, but in a negative form; </li><li>  do not be too direct - foreign partners may find you quite aggressive in this case; </li><li>  not always enough failure - the customer, for example, may decide that you are bargaining. </li></ul><br>  So get ready to explain everything in detail.  And this is how it can be done. <br><br><blockquote>  Reason for this is ... </blockquote>  The main reason is ... <br><br><blockquote>  The thing is that ... </blockquote>  The fact is that ‚Ä¶ <br><br><blockquote>  You see, the fact is ... </blockquote>  You see, the problem is that ... <br><br><blockquote>  One possible explanation is that ... </blockquote>  One of the reasons is that ... <br><br><blockquote>  What is responsible for this effect is ... </blockquote>  The reason is this ... <br><br><blockquote>  Let me explain ... </blockquote>  Let me explain ... <br><br><blockquote>  That‚Äôs because </blockquote>  I have no doubt that the reason is ... <br><br><blockquote>  It could well be that ... </blockquote>  Perhaps the fact is that ... <br><br><blockquote>  I'd say that we can't as ... </blockquote>  I would say that we cannot for a reason ... <br><br><blockquote>  It's due / owing to the fact that ... </blockquote>  The thing is ... <br><br><blockquote>  I'll tell / give / lay / explain the reason why ... </blockquote>  I will explain why ... <br><br><blockquote>  Because of / on account of / seeing that ... </blockquote>  Because‚Ä¶ <br><br><blockquote>  There is a number of reasons why ... </blockquote>  There are a number of reasons why ... <br><br>  We hope that these tips will help you improve or maintain business relations at the proper level, as well as better understand the culture of business communication in general. <br><br><h3>  EnglishDom.com - online English learning platform </h3><br> <a href="https://www.englishdom.com/promo/habronline2/%3Futm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_source%3Dhabra%26utm_campaign%3Denglishhumor"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xe/to/sd/xetosdsfunzijm9f8lx5tebzufq.png"></a> <br><br>  ‚Üí Study in the online game mode - download in English on the online courses from EnglishDom.com. <br>  According to the <a href="https://www.englishdom.com/promo/habronline2/%3Futm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_source%3Dhabra%26utm_campaign%3Denglishhumor">link</a> - 2 months of premium subscription for all courses as a gift. <br><br>  ‚Üí For live communication - choose individual training via Skype with a teacher. <br>  The first trial lesson is free, register here.
