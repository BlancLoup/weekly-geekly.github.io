  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Granin. This strange life</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Very often on Habr√© now there are articles on the topic of time management.  Many tips and own examples.  This phrase is even beginning to annoy, especially if you can not follow the recommendations, and the articles are two a day.  On the other hand, say it in Russian: time management - and a completely different meaning appears. <br>  The other day I read a book in which this time management was raised to a higher degree.  All human life is devoted to this.  All his strange life. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8f2/950/660/8f2950660ab4a32e553085a6877a0c67.jpg"><br>  There was such a person: Alexander Lyubishchev.  A brilliant scientist, biologist, professor, a terrific man, fascinated by so many aspects of life.  You can say Lomonosov modernity. <br>  There was another man: Daniel Granin.  A writer who dedicated his works to the works of scientists and strong personalities.  So, Granin took it, did not spare his time and himself and wrote the biography of Lyubishchev.  Perhaps this is the third biography that I was interested to read (the first is ‚ÄúYou must be joking, Mr. Feynman‚Äù, the second is ‚ÄúJust for fun‚Äù). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In fact, Lyubishchev was a very strange man ‚Äî a classic genius scientist ‚Äî he denied everything and questioned it.  For him there was no authority.  It is necessary to move forward, to open new horizons.  And the main thing is not to be afraid of mistakes.  Even Einstein was wrong. <br>  But this is not wonderful in Lyubishchev, and Granin takes the reader to a different direction. <br>  The hero of this biography was a miser about time: every day, every month, every year, he counted how many hours and minutes were spent on books, science, research, recreation, family.  While we cannot plan for tomorrow, Lyubishchev, with an accuracy of 1%, planned his time for the year ahead.  And even personal tragedies could not prevent it. <br>  He did not lose a minute just like that, and at the same time he did not need to resort to schemes of short sleep, to get rid of the joys of life or family relationships.  All this fit into his schedule.  He managed to read just a huge number of books and works, write a lot of articles, reviews, help other people.  Much of what he wrote was never printed, but he needed it personally to train himself, his memory and critical mind. <br>  But from the evaluation of the book, I somehow abruptly turned to the evaluation of the hero. <br>  The book resembles a rather admiring comment by the author and nevertheless remains a biography and is very interesting to read.  Granin does not just describe the life of the hero, he gives his assessment, a projection on the life of ordinary people, draws conclusions.  In fact, the author did a huge job: it was necessary to shake up all the archives, publications, and re-read many volumes of Lyubishchev‚Äôs neatly written diaries. <br>  Artistically, the value as such is not a work.  You will not find here elegant techniques or naked emotions, acute conflict or struggle.  The book rather gives food for thought, as well as the biographies I mentioned above.  And despite the fact that I agree that I don‚Äôt have to choose an idol for myself, I think that you need to take an example from such people.  But only an example needs to be taken wisely and taking into account individual peculiarities.  Just when reading, I had a feeling of some mechanical life of Lyubishchev.  Everything is painted for him, for every business his time.  He achieved a lot, had a lot of time, but didn‚Äôt he lose something?  Although it is more likely that he enjoyed such orderliness. <br>  But it is better to read once, than once from someone to hear: <br>  txt: <a href="http://lib.ru/PROZA/GRANIN/strange.txt">http://lib.ru/PROZA/GRANIN/strange.txt</a> <br>  fb2: <a href="http://flibusta.net/b/20473">http://flibusta.net/b/20473</a> </div>
