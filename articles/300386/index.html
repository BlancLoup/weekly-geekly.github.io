Under these conditions, ‚Äúeveryday‚Äù business issues are postponed on the shelf, ‚Äúuntil the first customer‚Äù.  But when this client appears, there are even more hypotheses.  In addition, the whole process is fueled by healthy competition in the market.  In these circumstances, the main thing seems to be only the competitive ability of the product, and the issues related to monetization, the team is trying to decide on a simple one: ‚Äújust like that, and here is your bill for payment‚Äù.  In principle, in the B2B sector, it is possible to live up to 50 and basic customers.  But often, teams start to stumble even before the moment when resources appear for an individual person in a team that will deal only with billing. <br><br>  We have prepared 8 advantages that the SaaS business gets by connecting a ready-made billing automation solution. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>1. Ready financial instrument</b>

      Billing is a system that stands above payment instruments.  She, at a minimum, is able to: keep a personal account (balance) of a client, calculate a tariff plan change, integrate with payment systems on the fly, generate invoices for future debits, manage products flexibly, easily automate financial document flow (generation of bills, acts and invoices for legal entities). <br><br>  <b>2. Best Monetization Subscription Practices</b> <br><br>  Every successful business has an understanding in which vectors it is necessary to develop their project in order to increase revenue, but not everyone understands how best to automate all this routine associated with periodic debits from a client‚Äôs account and to properly co-adjust with accounting.  After all, there are many pitfalls in it, the analysis of which will have to spend time. <br><br>  <b>3. Willingness to change</b> <br><br>  With the development of your business, you will: experiment with your tariff policy, introduce new packages and promotions, combine options between different products.  And billing, in this situation, should not behave like a log.  His task: to flexibly change the showcase of tariff plans, turning it upside down and enter the pricing of new services and options without running major tasks on reprogramming the logic of billing. <br><br>  <b>4. Automation of the primary</b> <br><br>  Sooner or later, the company may have to face the provision of services to legal entities.  This means that it is necessary to implement invoicing and closing documents (acts and invoices).  Often, for this they hire an accountant, who takes from 35 rubles for each document presented.  And your programmers are trying not to touch this process, since the principles of accounting are outside their interests.  After all, in order to understand them, you will have to spend time and quit the main occupation - developing your own product and customer support.  But in fact, an accountant really needs your business only to properly pay taxes and balance the company's balance sheet.  And the formation of primary documents can be engaged in the billing itself automatically. <br><br>  <b>5. Ready personal financial account for the client</b> <br><br>  There is one more thing that young projects omit (and some even after 1000 clients do not deal with it).  This is a <a href="http://userguide.priceplan.ru/lichnii_kabinet_klienta.html">self-service page</a> where a customer can: view the balance replenishment history, download closing documents, purchase additional services or switch to a new tariff plan, without waiting for the old tariff to end. <br>  PricePlan has the ability to connect a ready-made personal account, where all these functions are implemented, and embed it into your project as a widget, by analogy with the Vkontakte I Like widget. <br><br>  <b>6. Analytics</b> <br><br>  Very often, from our customers who came to us with a large subscriber base, we hear that only now they see a clear picture of their business: <br>  - What profit awaits them next month; <br>  - For which products dump higher; <br>  - For what product they earn the most; <br><br>  <b>7. Automation of transactional email newsletters</b> <br><br>  Billing always knows better than the email list service, which products the client used, which customers did not renew their subscriptions last month, etc. <br>  PricePlan gives you the opportunity to customize any chain of email newsletters to customers.  Letters with invoices never fall into spam!  And the whole history of email notifications will be recorded in the client's card. <br><br>  <b>8. You yourself create business rules, and we do not dictate them to you</b> (here, if you read further, an explosion of fantasy and a brain may occur)! <br><br>  Usually, subscription to the SaaS service means that you lose the possibility of deep customization of the solution, and therefore some prefer their own ‚Äúgarage design‚Äù instead of common practice, sacrificing the resources of their team.  We decided to preserve the flexibility of the ‚Äúgarage development‚Äù and combine it with the cost of owning a ready-tested general solution.  So, our business rules module was born in our system, which, without programming skills, but with a bright head (or our technical support), gives you the opportunity to extend or redefine the functionality of our system anywhere without waiting for a new release. <br><br>  And finally, we share with you our hospital statistics: <br>  ‚Ä¢ Average setup and implementation time PricePlan&gt; without integration - 1-2 days; <br>  ‚Ä¢ The average time to start working in <a href="http://priceplan.ru/en/solution/saas-billing/">PricePlan</a> with integration into the IT infrastructure is 2-3 weeks. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/300386/">https://habr.com/ru/post/300386/</a></p>
