There was a state of emergency: since October 1999, the crawlers stopped.  Although users are still given search results, but they are out of date for five months.  More was at stake than engineers had imagined.  At the moment, Larry Page and Sergey Brin were negotiating the delivery of Google search to the largest Internet portal Yahoo and promised to increase the search index tenfold to keep up with the World Wide Web, which doubled in size in the previous year.  If the crawlers are not repaired, google.com gets stuck in the past, the deal with Yahoo can fail, and the company risks burning the investment and sink into oblivion. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In the conference room at the stairs, engineers put doors on the box, built improvised tables and installed computers.  A sad Craig Silverstein sat near the far wall: a 27-year-old thin young man with a thin voice.  Craig was the first employee of Google: he joined the company when its main office was located in the living room of Brin, and he personally rewrote most of the code of the founders.  After four days and nights of work, they did not achieve anything with a Romanian system engineer named Bogdan Kokosel: ‚ÄúNone of the tests performed had any meaning,‚Äù Silverstein recalled.  ‚ÄúNothing worked, and we didn‚Äôt know why.‚Äù <br><br>  Silverstein barely noticed near Sanjay Gemavat, a modest 33-year-old brunet with thick eyebrows and graying temples, a MIT graduate.  Sanjay was hired just a few months ago, in December.  He came after his colleague, the slim and energetic thirty-year-old Jeff Dean of Digital Equipment Corporation.  Jeff left DEC ten months before Sanjay.  They were extremely friendly and preferred to write code together.  In the ‚Äúwar room‚Äù, Jeff pushed a chair toward Sanjay's desk, leaving his empty one.  Sanjay pounded on the keyboard, and Jeff sat back, straightening and dictating, like a producer in a news announcer's earpiece.

      Jeff and Sanjay began to study the stalled index.  They found that some words were missing: they entered the query [mailbox] and did not receive any results, while others are not listed in order.  For several days, they were looking for a mistake, plunging into the logic of the code.  Section by section, checked everything.  No bugs. <br><br>  Programmers sometimes present their program as a layer structure that descends from the user interface down to more fundamental layers.  At the bottom of this structure, software is found with iron: such a descent from platonic code abstractions to electricity and silicon physics.  On the fifth day of work, Jeff and Sanjay began to suspect that the problem is not in the logic of the code, but has a physical reason.  They converted the index file into binary code.  They wanted to see what cars see. <br><br>  A thick column with zeros and ones appeared on Sanjay‚Äôs monitor, each row representing an indexed word.  Sanjay remarked: 0 stands in place 0. When Jeff and Sanjay gathered all the distorted words, they saw a pattern: the same failure in each word.  Damage to memory chips on servers. <br><br>  Sanjay looked at Jeff.  Over the course of several months, Google experienced more and more hardware failures.  The problem was that as Google grew, the computing infrastructure also expanded.  Computer equipment rarely fails, unless you have a lot of computers - then they break down all the time.  Wires wear out, hard drives fall apart, motherboards overheat.  Many cars fail at once;  others start to work slower.  Strange natural factors come into play.  When a supernova explodes in space, the blast wave creates high-energy particles that are scattered in all directions: scientists believe that there is a non-zero chance that one of the particles of cosmic radiation could get into a computer chip on Earth and change 0 to 1. The most reliable computer systems in the world , at NASA, financial firms and the like, use special equipment that protects against single-bit "flips."  But Google still worked as a startup and bought cheap computers that didn‚Äôt have such protection.  The company has reached the point of inflection.  The computing cluster has grown to such a size that even unlikely hardware failures have become inevitable. <br><br>  Together, Jeff and Sanjay wrote the code to compensate for the failure on damaged systems.  Soon built a new index - and the emergency was successfully resolved.  Silverstein was confused.  He ingeniously debugged the code, but here the answer was hidden at the hardware level.  Jeff and Sanjay went deeper. <br><br>  Before the March fiasco, Google worked on the code that the company's founders wrote in Stanford graduate school.  Page and Brin were not professional programmers.  They were scientists who conducted an experiment in the field of search technology.  When the crawler fell, he did not display any informative diagnostic message, except for the phrase "Damn, horse!" <br><br>  The BigFiles system written by Page and Brin, the first employees of the company jokingly called BugFiles.  An extremely important indexing procedure took several days, and if I encountered a problem, I started from the very beginning.  It was a completely non-scalable system. <br><br>  We say that we are ‚Äúsearching the Internet‚Äù, but in reality this is not the case: we work with the search index on the search engine servers.  When Google was still called BackRub in 1996, the whole index was placed on computers installed in the page of the Page hostel.  In March 2000, not a single supercomputer could handle it.  The only solution left for Google is to buy ordinary computers and add them to a giant cluster.  Since half the cost of conventional computers is what Google considers "garbage" ‚Äîdisc drives, metal cases ‚Äî the company ordered only bare motherboards and hard drives ‚Äî and put them together.  By the time Google has already connected 1500 such homemade servers in two-meter racks in a building in Santa Clara, California.  Due to hardware failures, only 1,200 worked at any one time. Failures occurred unpredictably and continued to disrupt the system.  In order to survive, Google needed to combine computers into a single viable organism, resistant to disruptions. <br><br>  A couple of Jeff and Sanjay took over the job.  Wayne Rosing, who designed Apple's predecessor of the Macintosh, came to Google in November 2000, gathering a team of one hundred engineers.  Working ninety hours a week, they wrote code so that no HDD crash would disrupt the system.  They added breakpoints to the Web traversal process so that the cradle restarts from the moment it crashes, not from the very beginning.  Having developed new coding and compression schemes, they actually doubled the capabilities of the system.  They were inexorable optimizers.  For example, Google moved the most frequently used data to the outer side of the HDD plates, where the higher speed of rotation of the disk and, consequently, higher speed of reading and writing information, and the inner regions of the plates left empty.  Jeff and Sanjay used this space to store pre-processed data for general search queries.  For four days in 2001, they proved that the Google index can be stored in fast RAM instead of slow HDDs.  The discovery completely changed the economy of the company.  Paige and Bryn knew that users were flocking to the service, which instantly gave answers.  The problem was that speed required computational power, and computational power cost money.  Jeff and Sanjay managed to squeeze through the eye of a needle with the help of software optimizations. <br><br>  Alan Eustace led the engineering team after leaving Rosing in 2005.  ‚ÄúParadoxically, but to solve large-scale tasks, it is necessary to know the smallest details,‚Äù said Eustace.  Jeff and Sanjay understood the system to a bit level.  One day, Jeff distributed a list of <a href="https://gist.github.com/jboner/2841832">"Delay rates that every programmer should know</a> . <a href="https://gist.github.com/jboner/2841832">"</a>  In fact, this is a list of numbers that almost no programmer thinks about, but these numbers are literally embedded in the brain of Jeff and Sanjay: for example, a call from the L1 cache takes 0.5 ns or that sequential reading of one megabyte from memory takes 250 ¬µs.  After a series of key software optimizations, the power of Google‚Äôs systems has been scaled to orders of magnitude.  Meanwhile, in the extensive data processing centers, appliances began to go along winding paths, following program-generated instructions for replacing hard drives, power supplies, and memory modules.  Even when parts were wearing out and breaking down, the system flourished. <br><br>  Today, Google‚Äôs engineers have a unified classification system that starts with level 1, this is tech support.  Level 2 - college graduates.  Level 3 employees often have a master‚Äôs degree.  Getting level 4 takes several years or requires a Ph.D.  The career of most employees stops at level 5. Engineers of level 6 are the top 10% of the staff, they are so talented that the success of the projects depends on them.  Seventh level give employees a level 6 with a long track record.  Level 8 chief engineers are responsible for specific products or parts of the infrastructure.  About outstanding engineers of the 9th level speak with respect.  The title of Google Fellow (level 10) is awarded for life usually to the world's leading experts in their fields.  Jeff and Sanjay are the Senior Google Fellows, the first and only level 11 employees. <br><br>  The Google Campus, located just off the highway a few minutes from the center of Mountain View, is a series of squat, unattractive buildings with tinted windows.  One Monday morning in the summer of 2017, after a morning session of pair programming, Jeff and Sanjay went to lunch at the campus cafeteria called the Big Table, named after the system they helped develop in 2005 to unite countless computers into a virtually single device.  Tall and thin Sanjay in burgundy-colored ancient Henley shirt, gray trousers and small glasses on a wire rim peered out a table on the terrace and quickly took it, opening an umbrella and crouching in the shade.  Next to the sun, he set another chair for Jeff, who arrived a minute later, a broad-shouldered sports man in a short-sleeved shirt and stylish sneakers. <br><br>  Like lovers, Jeff and Sanjay tell stories together, complementing pieces of the overall picture.  They began to recall their first projects. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe wrote everything manually,‚Äù says Sanjay.  His glasses darkened in the sun.  - It was necessary to rewrite the code and then suddenly: "Oh, this is similar to what we wrote last month." <br><br>  ‚ÄúOr a slightly different pass in our indexing data,‚Äù Jeff added. <br><br>  ‚ÄúOr a little different,‚Äù says Sanjay.  - And so we found out ... <br><br>  ‚ÄúThis is the essence,‚Äù said Jeff. <br><br>  ‚Äú... what is a general pattern,‚Äù Sanjay concludes. <br><br>  Jeff bit off a slice of pizza.  He has a sailor's fingers, knotted and hard.  Sanjay looks very gentle in comparison to him.  He wonders how they started practicing pair programming: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt even know how we decided it would be better this way.‚Äù <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe worked like this before Google,‚Äù said Jeff. <br><br>  ‚ÄúBut I don‚Äôt know why we decided that it‚Äôs better to have one computer and not two,‚Äù says Sanjay. <br><br>  ‚ÄúMy DEC lab was two blocks from his lab,‚Äù says Jeff.  - And between them is an ice cream shop. <br><br>  - So this is an ice cream shop!  - Sanjay is delighted. <br><br>  Bachelor Sanjay spends holidays with Jeff, his two daughters and wife Heidi.  Jeff's daughters call him Uncle Sanjay, and the five of them often have dinner on Fridays.  Sanjay and Victoria, Jeff's eldest daughter, took up baking.  ‚ÄúI saw them grow,‚Äù says Sanjay proudly.  After the Google IPO in 2004, they moved to new homes that are six kilometers apart.  Sanjay lives in a modest three-bedroom house in Old Mountain View, and Jeff himself designed his house near the center of Palo Alto, setting up a trampoline in the basement.  While working on the house, he found that he liked to design the space, but lacked patience for the details, which he calls the ‚ÄúSanjay-oriented aspects‚Äù of the architecture: the details of the beams, the fixtures, the calculation of the loads that prevent the great project from falling apart. <br><br>  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know why others don‚Äôt work this way,‚Äù says Sanjay about pair programming. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe need to find a partner who is compatible with you in a way of thinking so that you complement each other,‚Äù said Jeff. <br><br>  They got up from the table and went to look for soft ice cream, walking along the Big Table among scurrying Googlers.  As they walked, Jeff outlined his strategy for soft ice cream: ‚ÄúI spin it.  I think this approach adds stability, ‚Äùhe said.  Satisfied and goal-oriented Sanjay spun the chocolate-vanilla mixture into his glass. <br><br>  In the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0226238679/">‚ÄúCircles of Cooperation: The Dynamics of Friendship and Creativity‚Äù of</a> 2001, the sociologist Michael P. Farrell explored close creative teams: French Impressionists, Sigmund Freud and his contemporaries.  ‚ÄúMost of the fragile ideas that initiated a new vision arise not when the whole group is together, and not when everyone works alone, but when they collaborated and interacted in pairs,‚Äù he wrote.  Monet and Renoir worked side by side in the summer of 1869.  They created a style that became impressionism;  six years of working together gave birth to cubism, Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque often signed only the reverse side of the canvases to hide from each other the fact of the completion of the work (‚ÄúThe work was not completed until we both felt this was true,‚Äù Picasso recalled later).  In the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1848545924/">‚ÄúDouble Strength: Search for Essence of Innovation in Creative Couples,‚Äù</a> writer Joshua Wolf Schenk quotes a 1971 interview in which John Lennon said that either he or Paul McCartney ‚Äúwrote a couple of light notes like‚Äú I read the news today ‚Äùor that sort of thing  ‚ÄúOne of us got stuck until the other one came,‚Äù Lennon said, ‚ÄúI will sing half, and he had the inspiration to write another part, and vice versa.‚Äù  Anyone can get into a creative dead end, but hardly two people at the same time. <br><br>  At the stage of ‚Äútheoretical construction‚Äù of a new science or art, it is important to expand the horizons without getting stuck in a dead end.  Francois Jacob, who, together with Jacques Monodom, made a breakthrough in the study of the regulatory function of genes, noted that by the middle of the 20th century, most molecular biology research was carried out in pairs: ‚ÄúTogether it is easier than one to invent theories and build models,‚Äù Jacob wrote.  - When two minds work on a problem, ideas appear more often and faster.  They rebound from partner to partner.  They twist together like branches on a tree.  And false illusions are nipped in the bud. ‚Äù  Over the past 35 years, about half of the Nobel Prizes in the field of physiology and medicine have been awarded to pairs of scientists. <br><br>  After many years of working together, partners sometimes develop their own language, as the twins do.  They imitate each other in habits and clothes, they have a general sense of humor.  It becomes impossible to evaluate the specific contribution of each to working together.  But such close partnerships are rarely found in software development.  Although developers sometimes talk about ‚Äúpair programming‚Äù, when two programmers share one computer, one ‚Äúbehind the wheel‚Äù and the other ‚Äúnavigator‚Äù, they usually represent only working relationships, like pilots in an airplane.  Jeff and Sanjay, on the contrary, sometimes seem to be two hemispheres of one brain.  In their most famous scientific works listed up to a dozen co-authors.  However, Bill Cochran, one of their managers, recalls: "They were so prolific and so effective as a couple, that we often just created teams around them." <br><br>  In 1966, researchers at System Development Corporation found that the best programmers were more than ten times more efficient than the worst.  Since then, the debate continues about the existence of the so-called "10-fold programmer."  This idea emphasizes individuality, while large software projects create a team.  In programming, little is achieved in isolation.  Ironically, many programmers see the results of Jeff-Sanjay‚Äôs collaborative work as evidence that a 10-fold programmer exists. <br><br>  Jeff was born in Hawaii in July 1968.  His father Andy was a researcher of tropical diseases;  Virginia Lee's mother is a medical anthropologist who knew half a dozen languages.  For fun, father and son assembled a computer from the IMSAI 8080 kit. They soldered the details, studying each part. <br><br>  Jeff and his parents often moved.  At thirteen, he missed the last three months of the eighth grade to help them in a refugee camp in western Somalia.  In high school, he began writing a data collection program for epidemiologists called Epi Info;<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">it has become a standard tool for researchers, translated into dozens of languages, and has sold hundreds of thousands of copies (a </font></font><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/epiinfo/story/story1976.html"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">photo of Jeff</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> from his graduation is </font><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/epiinfo/story/story1976.html"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">published</font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> on the website of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">). Heidi, whom Jeff met at the University of Minnesota college, only learned about the significance of this program years later. ‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt boast that much,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúEverything had to be pulled out of it.‚Äù Their first date took place at the women's basketball game, where Jeff entertained the audience in a gopher costume.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Jeff's doctoral thesis is dedicated to compilers. ‚ÄúCompilers themselves are pretty boring,‚Äù says Alan Eustace, but on the other hand, ‚Äúthis is a very low level, close to hardware.‚Äù Describing Jeff, Sanjay twists his finger at his temple: ‚ÄúWhen writing the code, a certain model will form in his head. What will be the performance of this code? It almost automatically calculates all border situations. ‚Äù </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Sanjay first sat down at a computer at the age of seventeen, when he went to Cornell University. He was born in West Lafayette, Indiana, in 1966, but grew up in Cote, an industrial city in northern India. His father Mahipal was a professor of botany, Shanta's mother took care of Sanjay and his two older brothers and sisters. The family loved books: his uncle Ashok Mehta remembers buying </font><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0525535861/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúThe Day of the Jackal‚Äù for</font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> children</font></font><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0525535861/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Frederick Forsythe with a torn binding, and the kids all together read a battered book, passing each other pages when finished. Sanjay's brother, Pankaj, became the youngest lecturer to ever get a position at the Harvard Business School (he is now a professor at New York University). Pankaj studied at the same school as Sanjay and was known as a Renaissance man: ‚ÄúI sort of lived in the shadow of my brother,‚Äù says Sanjay. As an adult, he retained this modesty. In 2016, when he was introduced to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, he did not even tell his parents; they learned the news from a neighbor.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the MIT graduate school, Sanjay made friends. However, he never met girls there, and now he does it ‚Äúvery, very rarely.‚Äù He says he did not refuse to start a family, it just happened. His close friends learned not to disturb him about this, and his parents had long understood that his son would remain a bachelor. Perhaps because it is so closed, a certain halo of mystery has formed around Google in Sangjay. He is considered a quiet but thorough engineer ‚Äî one who thinks deeply and with extraordinary clarity. On the table he has a neat stack of Mead notebooks for almost twenty years, filled with neat lists and diagrams. He still keeps records by hand: he says it helps to think. At MIT, Barbara Liskov, an influential computer scientist, was his research advisor,which studied including the management of complex code bases. In her opinion, the best code is like good literature. It should have a carefully thought out structure, and every word should work. Such programming requires empathy with readers. And the code is considered not only as a means of achieving the goal, but also as a valuable artifact in itself. "I think he designs the systems best," says Craig Silverstein. ‚ÄúJust look at its code: it is beautiful, like a work of art, like a sculpture with perfect proportions.‚Äù"I think he designs the systems best," says Craig Silverstein. ‚ÄúJust look at its code: it is beautiful, like a work of art, like a sculpture with perfect proportions.‚Äù"I think he designs the systems best," says Craig Silverstein. ‚ÄúJust look at its code: it is beautiful, like a work of art, like a sculpture with perfect proportions.‚Äù</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In Google, Jeff is much more famous. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">About him create memes as about Chuck Norris. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">("Chuck Norris counted to infinity ... twice"; "Jeff Dean's summary lists things he did not do: so shorter").</font></font><br><br><blockquote> <i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúWhen Jeff Dean develops a program, he first creates a binary, and then writes the source code as documentation.‚Äù </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"Jeff Dean once failed the Turing test, because he correctly set the 203rd Fibonacci number in less than a second." </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúOne day in 2002, when the search back-end turned off, Jeff Dean manually answered user questions for two hours. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">During this period, the quality of search results has increased significantly. ‚Äù</font></font></i> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> From the article </font></font><a href="https://habr.com/post/192604/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚Äú Jeff Dean of Google is Chuck Norris of our time ‚Äù</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> - approx.</font></font> per. </blockquote><br>  But for those who know both of them, Sanjay is equal to him in talent.  ‚ÄúJeff makes great new ideas and prototypes,‚Äù said Wilson Sie, their longtime colleague.  ‚ÄúSanjay is building things conscientiously.‚Äù  In life, Jeff is more sociable, Sanjay is more withdrawn.  The code is the opposite.  Jeff's programming is dazzling: he can quickly put forth startling ideas, but, as he does so quickly, with inspiration, can leave readers behind.  Sanjay code more understandable. <br><br>  ‚ÄúSome people write code that is too sparse,‚Äù explains Silverstein.  There is very little information on one screen.  You have to scroll back and forth to understand. ‚Äù  Others write too tight code: ‚ÄúYou look at it and think:‚Äû Wow.  I don't want to figure it out. ‚Äù  Sanjay somehow manages to find a balance.  You look at its code and think: ‚ÄúOkay, I can understand it,‚Äù and still there is a lot of information on one page. ‚Äù  Silverstein continues: ‚ÄúWhenever I want to add new functionality to the code of Sanjay, he seemed to have foreseen this in advance.  I feel like Salieri.  I see greatness, but I don‚Äôt understand how this is possible. ‚Äù <br><br>  On Monday morning this spring, Jeff and Sanjay were standing in the kitchenette of building 40, which houses most of the Google AI division.  Behind them is a board filled with matrix algebra formulas, on the table is an article about adversarial networks.  Jeff in a faded T-shirt and jeans looks like a beach bum, which has become the way of correction.  Sanjay in a sweater and gray trousers.  Behind the bright windows are tall pines, behind them is a field.  Everywhere, where Jeff works in Google, be sure to put an espresso machine.  La Marzocco is about one meter wide on the kitchen table.  ‚ÄúWe're late,‚Äù remarks Sanjay over the grinder.  On the clock 8:32. <br><br>  After the cappuccino, they go to the computers.  Jeff rolls a chair from his dirty desk to Sanjay's immaculately clean desk.  He puts his foot on the bedside table, leaning back, while Sanjay studies the screen.  Four windows are open: on the left - the browser and the terminal for launching analysis tools;  on the right, two documents in the Emacs text editor: in one to-do list in a notebook, the other is filled with a colorful code.  One of Sanjay's notebooks is next to the computer. <br><br>  - OK, what did we do?  - asks Sanjay. <br><br>  ‚ÄúI think we analyzed the size of the TensorFlow Lite code,‚Äù says Jeff. <br><br>  This is a new large machine learning project: Jeff and Sanjay are worried about a bloated codebase.  Like literary editors, they are looking for ways to reduce volume.  To do this, they created a new tool, which itself needs to be optimized. <br><br>  ‚ÄúI tried to figure out how slow it is,‚Äù said Sanjay. <br><br>  ‚ÄúPretty slow,‚Äù Jeff leaned forward, still relaxed. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThis one was one hundred and twenty kilobytes,‚Äù says Sanjay, ‚Äúand it goes about eight seconds.‚Äù <br><br>  - One hundred twenty thousand stack calls, not kilobytes. <br><br>  - Well, kilobytes of text, well ... about as much. <br><br>  - Oh, yes, I'm sorry. <br><br>  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what threshold to choose for the unit size,‚Äù Sanjay asks.  - half a mega? <br><br>  ‚ÄúIt seems normal,‚Äù Jeff agrees.  Sanjay begins to knock on the keyboard, and Jeff clings to the screen.  ‚ÄúSo, you write that if it is more than this, we will simply choose ...‚Äù he fell silent;  Sanjay answered the code question. <br><br>  When Sanjay drives the car, he puts his hands on ten and two and carefully looks ahead.  The same discipline behind the keyboard.  His legs were shoulder-width apart, his back was straight, as if he was working on his posture.  Thin fingers gently run around the keys.  The first programmers began to arrive at the office. <br><br>  Soon they reached a small milestone, and Sanjay scored a team to run the test.  He looked exhausted and checked the mail.  The test has ended.  He did not notice. <br><br>  - Hey!  - Jeff snapped his fingers and pointed to the screen.  While talking to him gives jokes and puns, at the computer with Sanjay, he can become self-confident, rude and disapproving.  Sanjay takes this for granted.  When it seems to him that Jeff is moving too fast, he raises his hands from the keyboard and spreads his fingers, as if to say: ‚ÄúStop‚Äù.  This is the closest resemblance of a dispute: for twenty years they can not remember when they raised their voices. <br><br>  Sanjay scrolled through the page, a new section of code appeared on the screen. <br><br>  - From this you can make a routine procedure, is not it?  Asked Jeff. <br><br>  - Mmmm ... <br><br>  Jeff snapped his knuckles. <br><br>  - It seems possible.  Will do? <br><br>  Sanjay is open: <br><br>  - No, I ... <br><br>  - So, ignore the problem?  - Jeff asks indignantly. <br><br>  - No, I mean, we are just trying to understand what is happening.  To make notes about this, right? <br><br>  ‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù Jeff obviously had a good mood.  Together they dictated the note. <br><br>  Dinner was coming.  They worked for two hours with one ten-minute break, talking most of the time (the junior watching them would be most impressed by the fact that they never stopped and did not get stuck).  Standard engineering practice is to give the revision code, but Jeff and Sanjay skip this step, putting a lgtm mark (looks good to me).  In a sense, they are busy with little things.  However, their code is executed on a Google scale.  The kilobytes and microseconds they worry about are multiplied billions of times in data centers around the world ‚Äî huge, noisy data centers where endless racks of servers are cooled with water tanks.  On such days, Jeff, as you know, comes home and tells his daughters: "Today, Sanjay and I accelerated Google search by ten percent." <br><br>  In 2003, four months later, Jeff and Sanjay conducted, perhaps the biggest update in Google history.  They did this with the MapReduce software.  The idea came when they rewrote the Google crawler and indexer for the third time.  They realized that every time they solve an important problem: coordination of work in a huge number of geographically distributed, separately unreliable computers.  If you summarize the solution, the problem will be solved forever.  At the same time, a tool will appear that any programmer at Google can use to manage the machines in the data centers, as if all of them are a single computer the size of a planet. <br><br>  Jeff and Sanjay wrote MapReduce in a corner office overlooking the pond with ducks.  This tool forever streamlined a breathtakingly complex process.  Previously, each programmer had to independently figure out how to share and distribute data, assign jobs and take into account hardware failures.  MapReduce provides a structured way to solve these problems.  As the chef prepares the ingredients before starting the culinary work, MapReduce divides the tasks into two stages.  First, the programmer gives each machine a "map" of the task (for example, count the number of references to a word on a page);  then he writes instructions for "reducing" results from all machines (for example, by summing up).  MapReduce handles distribution details and thus hides them. <br><br>  The following year, Jeff and Sanjay rewrote Google's crawling and indexing system in terms of MapReduce tasks.  Soon, other engineers realized how powerful this system was and started using MapReduce to process video and render tiles on Google Maps.  MapReduce was so simple that new tasks appeared by themselves.  Google has a daily load cycle: during the day, there is more traffic than at night, and MapReduce tasks began to absorb idle capacity.  In a dream, the human brain processes the daily experience.  Now Google has begun processing its data at night. <br><br>  There has long been evidence that Google is actually an AI company, which only pretends to be a search engine.  In 2001, Noam Shazir, who shared the office with Jeff and Sanjay, decided to remake the spell checker system that Google licensed from another company.  This system continued to make awkward mistakes.  For example, the word TurboTax, she proposed to replace the turbot ax (flounder living in the North Atlantic). <br><br>  The quality of the spell checker depends on the dictionary.  Shazir realized that on the Internet, Google had access to the largest dictionary that ever existed in the history of mankind.  He wrote a program that used the statistical properties of text on the Internet to determine which words were most likely typed in error.  The program understood that ‚Äúpritany spears‚Äù and ‚Äúbrinsley spears‚Äù meant ‚ÄúBritney Spears‚Äù.  When Shazir showed the program at the weekly meeting, many employees repeatedly tried to deceive her, but mostly without success.  Shazir collaborated with Geoff Deane and an engineer named Georges Hariq to develop a similar advertising targeting system for web content.  This targeting brought a whole avalanche of money that the company sent to its computing infrastructure.  This was the beginning of a feedback loop: infrastructure growth improves Google‚Äôs computational skills and intelligence;  computational abilities become a source of profit, and profit allows you to grow your infrastructure.  This feedback cycle brought the company extreme and unprecedented market dominance. <br><br>  Resourceful programmers used MapReduce to get different insights from Google data: this is how it became possible to transcribe users' voice messages, answer their questions, auto-complete queries and translate texts into more than one hundred languages.  These systems were developed using relatively simple machine learning algorithms.  However, ‚Äúwhen you have a lot of data, very simple methods work incredibly well,‚Äù said Jeff.  Because ‚Äúdata, data, data‚Äù - stored and processed using BigTable, MapReduce and their successors - is the company's main asset, Google‚Äôs global infrastructure has become more flexible and scalable.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãdistributed computing appeared long ago.  The concepts of "cloud computing" and "big data" existed before the advent of Google.  But by making the infrastructure intelligently managed for distributed programs by ordinary programmers, Jeff and Sanjay took Google to a new level.  Users have felt that something has changed - the Google cloud is getting smarter. <br><br>  In 2004, Jeff and Sanjay thought the system would be useful for astronomers, geneticists, and other scientists with a lot of data to process.  Then they published the article <a href="https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//archive/mapreduce-osdi04.pdf">"MapReduce: Simplified Data Processing in Large Clusters</a> . <a href="https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//archive/mapreduce-osdi04.pdf">"</a>  The document appeared as God from the car.  Cheap equipment, the growth of web services and connected devices led to the flow of data, but only a few companies had software for processing such arrays of information.  The two engineers who struggled to scale a small search engine called Nutch - Mike Cafarella and Doug Cutting - were so convinced of the importance of MapReduce that they decided to create a free clone of this system from scratch.  In the end, they called their project Hadoop, after the name of the toy elephant, whom Katting's son loved. <br><br>  Gradually, Hadoop introduced half of the Fortune 50 companies. It has become synonymous with big data.  Facebook used Hadoop MapReduce to store and process user metadata ‚Äî information about clicks, likes, ad views.  At some point, Facebook had the largest cluster of Hadoop in the world.  Hadoop MapReduce contributed to the success of LinkedIn and Netflix. <br><br>  Former NSA technology director Randy Garrett remembers showing technology to NSA director, General Keith Alexander.  Hadoop performed the analysis task 18,000 times faster than the previous system.  This became the basis for a new approach to intelligence gathering, which some observers call the "total collection of everything." <br><br>  Jeff has a restless nature: for him, the problem loses interest when he sees a solution.  In 2011, cloud computing swept the world, and Jeff Dean began working with Andrew Eun, a computer science professor at Stanford, who led Google's secret project on neural network research.  Jeff encountered neural networks back in his student years, but then they could not solve real problems.  Eun told Jeff that the situation has changed.  At Stanford, researchers have achieved some impressive results by giving the neural network access to large amounts of data.  Eun suggested that on a large scale neural networks can become not only useful, but also powerful. <br><br>  Neural networks are very different from traditional computer programs.  Their behavior is not determined by the usual commands, instead the network is ‚Äútrained‚Äù using input data and feedback.  Jeff's knowledge of neural networks has not advanced since his student years, and Heidi watched as their bathroom was filled with textbooks.  Jeff started paying about a day a week to a project called Google Brain.  Many at Google have doubted this technology.  ‚ÄúA waste of talent,‚Äù recalls Alan Eustace, Jeff's manager at the time.  Sanjay also could not understand the decision of a friend: ‚ÄúYou are working on infrastructure, what have you forgotten there?‚Äù <br><br>  Over the next seven years, the Google Brain team developed neural networks that showed the world's best result in machine translation, speech recognition and images.  In the end, these neural networks replaced the most important Google algorithms for ranking search results and advertising targeting, and Google Brain became one of the fastest growing teams in the company.  Claire Tsui, Google‚Äôs engineer since 2001, says that Jeff‚Äôs decision was a turning point for Google‚Äôs AI development: ‚ÄúSome people believed it, others didn‚Äôt.  Jeff has proven that it can work. ‚Äù <br><br>  It turned out that the AI ‚Äã‚Äãcritically needed the scale, and system engineer Jeff Dean provided it.  As part of this project, he led the development of a program called TensorFlow - it was an attempt to create something like MapReduce, only for AI.  TensorFlow simplifies the distribution of a neural network in a cluster of computers, turning them into one big brain.  In 2015, when TensorFlow was released to the public, it became the de facto standard for working with AI.  Recently, Executive Director Sundar Pichi announced that Google‚Äôs main business is Artificial Intelligence, and appointed Jeff to lead all AI initiatives. <br><br>  Now, Jeff pays four days a week to managing Google Brain.  He leads the work of 3,000 people.  He travels to talks, holds weekly meetings to work on a new computer chip (a tensor processor designed specifically for neural networks) and helps in developing AutoML, a system that uses neural networks to design other neural networks.  He has time to program with Sanjay only once a week. <br><br>  History erases engineering feats.  We remember the great explorers of the eighteenth century ‚Äî James Cook, George Vancouver ‚Äî but not John Harrison, a carpenter from Yorkshire who, after decades of work, made the watch reliable enough to measure longitude at sea. <br><br>  Recently, Jeff and Sanjay enjoyed margaritas and enchiladas in their favorite Mexican restaurant, Palo Alto Sol.  Jeff pulled out his phone and asked, "When did Gmail come out?"  The phone answered: "April 1, 2004."  Sanjay, who observed the etiquette at the table, did not seem to appreciate the impulse of his friend, but Jeff was delighted.  Now Google is able to talk, listen and answer questions using a stack of programs that are easily integrated and largely invisible, stretching from its phone to data centers around the world. <br><br>  Today, their roles have diverged.  Sanjay at Google is known as an ‚Äúindividual member‚Äù - a coder who works alone and does not control anyone.  He is grateful for that.  ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt want to work like Jeff,‚Äù he admits.  He is currently creating software that will make it easier for engineers to combine and manage dozens of programs ‚Äî news, photos, prices ‚Äî that begin to work as soon as the user enters the text into the Google search box.  Once a week, he meets with a group of "technology leaders" (Area Tech Leads) - the engineering "Jedi Council" at Google - to make technical decisions that affect the entire company.  If Google were home, Jeff would build an extension, and Sanjay would strengthen the foundation, strengthen the beams, and tighten the bolts. <br><br>  Meanwhile, during their pairing programming sessions on Monday, they started something new.  This is an AI project: as Jeff says, trying to train the "giant" ML model to perform thousands or millions of different tasks.  Jeff thought about this idea for many years;  he recently decided that this was possible.  He and Sanjay plan to build a prototype around which the team can grow.  In the software world, the best way to manage a team is based on software code. <br><br>  ‚ÄúI think they miss each other,‚Äù says Heidi, Jeff's wife.  Friday dinners with the family appeared when their collaboration slowed down. <br><br>  On Sunday's March, Jeff and Sanjay met for a country hike.  The weather is clear, although it is hot in the sun.  Jeff arrived at a hiking trail on a blue Tesla Roadster with a Bernie 2016 bumper sticker. Sanjay soon followed him on a red Model S. Sanjay was reading a book in the morning, Jeff was playing football (the device on his wrist showed that he ran 11 kilometers. Two decades later after fixing that index, Jeff looks like a tanned, resilient endurance athlete. Sanjay doesn't seem to have aged at all. <br><br>  The path is a 10-kilometer loop through dense forests.  Jeff went first.  In the forest, they remembered how quickly Google had grown.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Sanjay recalled how after the first consolidation of the company, a plumber installed two toilets in the same toilet in the men's room. ‚ÄúI remember Jeff‚Äôs comment,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúTwo heads are better than one!‚Äù He laughed. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">They descended from the forest to a dry open area. In the sky flew a vulture. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúThe mountains are cooler than I thought,‚Äù Jeff admitted. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- And someone said that this is a flat trip. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúI think that's why there are no bike lanes here.‚Äù </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">They climbed back into the forest. Rising up the hill, Jeff saw a gap among the trees: "At some point there will be a good view," he said.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The trail went to the top of the hill, high and wide, without a forest, with a panoramic view. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Haze on the horizon did not close the mountains of Santa Cruz in the south and Mission Peak in the east. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúSanjay, here is your office!‚Äù Said Jeff. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">They stood together and looked across the valley.</font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fd7/4d8/859/fd74d8859bcdb84274abc3c789431381.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/432324/">https://habr.com/ru/post/432324/</a></p>
