  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Is everything done?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently I stumbled upon the mention of many of my favorite service called Evernotes, and accidentally stumbled upon the site. <a href="http://www.vselisdelal.ru/">Did I do everything?</a>  In addition to the <b>description of the service,</b> I would like to share the fact that it would be really interesting not only to ordinary users (people), but also for example to organizations if the implementation thereof was incorporated in this service. <br><br>  So, my first acquaintance with the ‚ÄúDid I do everything?‚Äù Service and my first Habratopik! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>What do we have?</b> <br>  In today's world, our notebook, communication device, camera is often our phone, because it is convenient to score a to-do list for today and tomorrow than to carry along with a notebook, the service I am writing to you about is a unique means of recording notes by voice (absolutely free!) and their further conversion into text.  At this service does not limit its functionality, for example, you can send a message to Twitter again, just by calling from your mobile phone to a toll-free number, and for a small fee you can send e-mail and SMS messages through your voice! <br><br>  <b>Testing</b> <br>  Naturally, after registering on the site, I could not restrain myself, and after activating my soap and mobile, I began to dial the coveted numbers from it to leave a note.  The first attempt was successful already after two minutes, a note appeared on the site with the text ‚ÄúChecking the service‚Äôs performance‚Äù, then I was interested in how it works, really, on the other end of the wire there is a person who listens and translates everything said into the text or still doing some other power ... I made the second call and gave the receiver to my 15-year-old sister, who, in a tired voice, repeated the phrase "Kill Maxim, Kill Maxim" twice. <br>  Long 7 minutes of waiting tormented me and I already thought that the record was put in a queue and the operator simply did not listen to it yet.  But as a result, after moments, the site showed ‚ÄúTo love Maxim, to love Maxim,‚Äù which could not at the same time please and grieve.  :-) <br>  The check for sending a post to twitter also showed a positive result after 5 minutes of waiting.

      <b>What would you like or the possibility of service for the future!?</b> <br>  1. Phone number.  Unfortunately, the service can add only one phone number by which it will be identified who owns the record, the ability to add an unlimited number of numbers would give the opportunity to set a to-do list from several phones, and perhaps for the corporate sector this is really important!  And besides, in the modern age, by setting up, for example, your child on the phone synchronizes the calendar with this service, father and mother could leave text notes (to-do list) with reminders for a day, two, three, etc.  And the employees of the company (for example, managers), having called the number saying ‚ÄúThe label Petrov The contract with‚Äú ABVltflpou ‚Äúwas signed‚Äù could report to the boss. <br>  2. Account.  Rather, it is relevant for the corporate sector, uploading a calendar (the ability to synchronize it with a mobile phone or communicator), and for each label a separate calendar.  Conveniently, the same Petrov synchronizes the to-do list that his superiors create to him, both through voice and through direct access to the site, Sidorov doesn‚Äôt see Petrov‚Äôs to-do list, he has enough of his own! <br>  3. Recognition of songs.  I have seen such a service somewhere, but still it would not be bad to hear an interesting song, dial a phone number and receive an SMS message with the name of the song or, for example, speak the Twitter command ‚ÄúListen to‚Äù and cut a song, and then you automatically tweet I listen to the post with the text and the name of the artist and the name of the song. <br>  4. Tariffs.  It is possible to change tariffs, enter the tariff designer, in which you can choose one or another functionality, connect certain services and pay only for them.  Connecting several phone numbers can also be made a paid service! <br>  5. Home phone.  Unfortunately (and perhaps fortunately), an SMS in our region cannot come to your home phone, which means that it‚Äôs not possible to use the service from your home phone, because  To confirm the number, you must enter the code that comes to him!  Implement confirmation by voice - this is the way out! <br>  6. Connected services.  In the future, they promise to work with such services as: blogspot.com, blogs.mail.ru, vkontakte.ru, LJ.  Nothing was said about Jabber, Skype and ICQ, but this is a thought ... sending messages through these services! <br><br>  This concludes the review and my dreams of a bright future for the project.  I ask you not to remember the bad word for the article, please indicate better the mistakes for future articles ... :-) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/71595/">https://habr.com/ru/post/71595/</a></p>
