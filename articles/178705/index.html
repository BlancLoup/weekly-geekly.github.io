I had to make a small web application that was supposed to help the doctor‚Äôs work.  There are not many use-cases there, to see who is being booked for an appointment today, the opportunity to look at the medical history, enter new data and create a new patient.  Business is ... <br><br>  I had a lot of time, nowhere to hurry.  At first, I thought of running a quick <a href="https://developers.google.com/web-toolkit/">GWT</a> + <a href="http://www.smartclient.com/smartgwt/showcase/">SmartGWT program</a> , but I thought it would be time to see something new.  In addition, there were obvious hints that there would be small orders of this kind, for libraries there all sorts of small and small firms.  I wanted something simple on the one hand, but at the same time quite powerful. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  A short googling made it clear that there is no particular choice, so I fixed my eyes on <a href="http://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/">ExtJS</a> .  I have already seen this thing before, and now God himself has ordered to get acquainted closer with this miracle of programming thought.

      What is done in such cases?  That's right, we looked at examples, downloaded, started picking.  There you will change, then add, my joy knew no bounds.  The truth is exactly to the point where I started doing exactly what I need.  I quickly realized that I would have to smoke manuals.  And since I'm lazy, I climbed up to look on the Internet for all kinds of tutorials, including here, in the Habr√©.  The more I read, the better I understood that ExtJS, you just can‚Äôt take it with a swoop, you need a serious approach to business.  After a few hours, porridge of ExtJS and its various components formed in my head. <br><br>  I had an interesting idea, but did I make the wrong choice, maybe I'm stupid for such a serious thing?  Climb again to look for reviews.  And I found ... I am not the only one so clever, I have brothers because of misunderstanding.  All wrote that the threshold of entry was at least high, and most argued that it was simply terrible. <br><br>  But do not throw the same thing halfway through!  This time I was looking for something that is friendly with ExtJS and at the same time simplifies my work.  Found <a href="http://www.ext4yii.com/">Ext4Yii</a> .  I looked at this miracle and realized that I would trade awl on soap.  At that moment, I was really quite downhearted, but then <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/149853/">an article</a> came to my eyes, where usability miracles and the increase of my productivity were promised many times.  Sin was not to look.  And I started with this video (by the way, the quality is not a fountain, but what is being done there can be understood): <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/ykMJOzkD4Bg%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjhxlbB4xRR3VbzEGies_1TOTywJQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  For the first time since this morning, I was happy, for hope was warm again in my soul.  I downloaded this <a href="http://dvelum.ru/index.html">thing</a> , tormented myself a little with an Apache, ordering him to point to the www folder in the project, and not the top folder (I later expressed my indignation with this fact to the authors of the project, to which they said they did not do such a good trick from a good life, but soon redo humanly).  And now I see the installation page, and in a minute I‚Äôm inside. <br><br>  And you know what?  The video, of course, does not quite correspond to reality, not everything is rosy, but in general, everything is as it is.  I made my first simple test application in less than an hour, everything worked.  Prozhka didn't do anything supernatural, but I realized that I could make prototypes and show them to customers in just a couple of hours.  Yes, yes, no kidding.  Svarganit a couple of windows and small connections between them, this is a matter of twenty minutes.  The entire server side is generated by itself, JavaScript is of course needed, but at the whole primitive level.  In general, the whole approach reminded me of the good old Borland Delphi 7.0 (it did not work with later versions, but the seven were very pleased with me then).  Later, I spent another couple of days to get acquainted with this product.  The most cool thing about this is that during the familiarization with ExtJS I also figured out a bit, Dvelum helped me a lot with this, reducing the threshold of entry.  In general, I am very pleased.  I recommend you in case you have nothing to do and the desire to simplify your own life to dig into this project a little.  With a very high probability, you will like it and you will spend the whole weekend following this process. <br><br>  A little about the structure of the project.  The whole GUI is written on ExtJS itself, so you can view Dvelum itself as Showcase.  You create the interface via Drag and Drop, all by an adult.  And even if you need to change the size of the window, then you don‚Äôt crawl into the code and do not look for width and height in its properties, but simply pull it out of the window, Dvelum will understand what you are doing.  This is really cool. <br>  All server side is made in PHP.  If you don‚Äôt need anything special, then you don‚Äôt have to go there at all, all the code is generated by yourself.  MySQL is used as a database.  And yes, you have nothing to do there either, all the tables, indexes and so on will make Dvelum for you. <br>  The project is divided into two parts: Frontend and Backend.  And the fact that you now thought is absolutely not true.  Backend is not something that is spinning on the server, this is the admin panel, where all the Web Mords are made.  In the same place, you can create users and assign them rights, who can see which table and what he can do with it (modify, delete).  You can also create pages for Frontend.  Frontend is the part that the average visitor sees.  On the basis of Dveluma, you can quickly bungle the site, it is also something like CMS. <br><br>  Naturally there are also disadvantages, I would call the following negative points: <br><br><ul><li>  Apache needs to say that DocumentRoot points to www, not the top project folder.  Trifle, but not pleasant, in the end this is an extra gesture. </li><li>  We must still have at least the slightest idea about ExtJS.  The simplest application can be done in such a way, but if you want something more serious, you will have to smoke manuals, although you will not have to go so deep. </li><li>  First you need to spend time getting acquainted with the interface and in general with the scheme and logic of the project.  At the very beginning, I was somewhat lost, but as soon as I understood the idea how everything was arranged, things went quickly and quickly. </li><li>  We must not forget to save the project of your interface, for this there is a special button.  When you change any parameter, for example, the height of the window, a window appears with the message that the property of the object has been saved.  But this does not mean that the whole project has been preserved.  If you leave Dveluma without having survived, then excuse me, your labors will go to ashes, which happened to me once. </li><li>  There is little documentation and it is ‚Äúdry‚Äù. </li></ul><br><br>  Pluses are much more important for me: <br><br><ul><li>  You can quickly, I mean really quickly, in a couple of hours to make a prototype.  And it will work and even look pretty good.  This prototype will be able to make even a schoolboy who works for your cookies. </li><li>  If you need something more serious, then it is also possible, but you will have to get acquainted with ExtJS. </li><li>  As a side effect of the previous item, you will know how ExtJS works, the threshold of entry is reduced. </li><li>  If you have forgotten some field in the table or form, then you do not need to frantically search for this place in the whole sheet of the declaration code, insert a couple of more lines there and say that you didn‚Äôt miss any bracket that will break everything.  No, everything is much simpler, you open a tablet, click a button and create another field in the appeared window, give it a name, format, etc.  Everything is simple, understandable and intuitive.  Just as it should be in 2013 from the birth of Christ. </li><li>  The product was made in Russia, so feel free to write on the forum in Russian. </li><li>  The developers respond to questions very quickly, which is good. </li><li>  Moped free </li></ul><br><br>  PS Moped is not mine, I just ride on it. <br><br>  PSS Probably written by me looks like a description of a product for fast prototyping.  It's right.  And that's not true ... Right now I'm doing a pretty serious application on Dvelume with dozens of windows and perverted logic on the server and the frontend.  While the flight is normal. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/178705/">https://habr.com/ru/post/178705/</a></p>
