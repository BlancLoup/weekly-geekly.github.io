      General sprints are an important concept in Atlassian Jira Software, because familiarity with general sprints occurs, as a rule, unexpectedly, and it seems that something went wrong.  But this is not the case, and if you know how general sprints work, then you can use them for your needs. <br><br>  In this article, I will show with examples how the general sprints look and how to distinguish them from ordinary sprints.  And also I will tell about their features. <br><br>  I tried all the examples in this article in the Jira Software Cloud and in the Jira Software Server 7.12.3. <br><br><h2>  What is a common sprint? </h2><br>  A common sprint is a sprint that is visible on more than one board. <br><br>  For example, there are such screenshots of boards: <br><br>  <i>SCRUM Board</i> : <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yo/nf/le/yonfle_r4zygzm-r6j5vasrnyqk.png"><br><br>  <i>SCRUM2 Board</i> : <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ed/lf/n6/edlfn6e1hweq3eipqs0hir2nju0.png"><br><br>  You can see that on the SCRUM and SCRUM2 boards there is a sprint called SCRUM Sprint 3. This sprint is visible on two boards.  Does that mean we see a total sprint?  Not.  In Jira Software there can be two different sprints with the same name. <br><br><h2>  How to see the sprint going? </h2><br>  In order to understand the general sprint in front of us or normal, we must look at the id of these two sprints. <br><br>  You can watch the sprint id like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cy/kk/5f/cykk5fam06elo8thzil6gjr5ess.png"><br><br>  If you hover the mouse over the button highlighted in the picture above in red, we will see the url, which will end in sprintId = &lt;number&gt;.  This number is the sprint id.  In our case, the two sprints went different, which means that we are not in a common sprint, but two regular sprints. <br><br><h2>  General sprint </h2><br>  Now let's take a look at this screenshot: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/7b/5a/1e/7b5a1ez-g2v7rm2r_w34xea-exc.png"><br><br>  In the screenshot we see the SCRUM board, on which there are two sprints with the same name.  And the sprint highlighted in red contains the same ticket as the sprint on the SCRUM2 board.  If we check the ID of this sprint on the SCRUM and SCRUM2 board, then the ID will match, which means that we have a common sprint. <br><br><h2>  Why do we have the same sprint on two boards? </h2><br>  Tickets that are visible on the board are selected by filters that are defined for the boards.  You can see the filters if you go to the Board Settings -&gt; General menu.  Here are the filters for the boards: <br><br>  <i>SCRUM board</i> : <br><br> <code>project = SCRUM OR priority is not EMPTY ORDER BY Rank ASC</code> <br> <br>  <i>SCRUM2 board</i> : <br><br> <code>project = SCRUM2 ORDER BY Rank ASC</code> <br> <br>  We see that the filter for SCRUM selects not only tickets from the SCRUM project, but also all tickets in our Jira instance that have priority filled, which means that it also selects tickets from the SCRUM2 project.  Therefore, tickets from the SCRUM2 project are visible both on the SCRUM board and on the SCRUM2 board.  And so if we fill in the Sprint field in one of the tickets, this sprint will appear on two boards. <br><br>  A sprint is created from the board and contains a link to the board from which it was created.  To do this, you can perform, for example, rest / agile / 1.0 / sprint / sprintId and see the board from which the sprint was created.  In our case, we get the following result: <br><br><pre> <code class="plaintext hljs">{"id":5,"self":"https://alex.atlassian.net/rest/agile/1.0/sprint/5","state":"active","name":"SCRUM Sprint 3","startDate":"2018-09-23T06:33:01.266Z","endDate":"2018-10-07T06:33:00.000Z","originBoardId":3,"goal":""}</code> </pre> <br>  originBoardId = 3, and this is the SCRUM2 board.  This means that the sprint was originally created on the SCRUM2 board, and it appeared on the SCRUM board because the sprint ticket is on both the SCRUM2 board and the SCRUM board. <br><br><h2>  How do the general sprints behave? </h2><br>  If you make any changes to the total sprint on any of the boards on which the sprint is visible, then the changes will be visible on all the boards. <br><br>  For example, if we rename a sprint on the SCRUM board, it will be renamed on the SCRUM2 board.  If we close the sprint on the SCRUM board, it will close on the SCRUM board. <br><br>  This behavior is usually met by users.  They work with a sprint and suddenly the sprint closes.  None of the team did not close it.  As a result, it turns out that the sprint was closed from another board, in which the filter selects tickets from this project. <br><br><h2>  How can you use common sprints? </h2><br>  Suppose we have several teams, and each team has its own project.  Each team creates a board and works on this board.  We want to see the sprints of all teams.  How can we do this? <br><br><ul><li>  We can ask to share all the boards for us, and then we can see the sprint, if we go to the desired board. </li><li>  We can create a board that will pick tickets from all the teams' projects.  In this case, we will see information on all sprints on one board, which will require less effort from us to view all team sprints.  But we must not forget that any actions with the sprint on our board will entail the same changes on the teams' boards. </li></ul><br>  That is all I wanted to tell in this article.  I hope you find the information useful. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/430966/">https://habr.com/ru/post/430966/</a></p>
