According to a study of <a href="https://roem.ru/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/di.iabbarometer2017.pdf">IAB Russia</a> on trends in online advertising for 2017, retargeting has become the most effective tool for promotion.  Today, 58% of Russian companies already use retargeting and 17% plan to use it next year. <a name="habracut"></a>

      There are a lot of reasons for the demand for retargeting, especially mobile retargeting.  80% of users do not return to the application 3 months after installation.  In addition, there has recently been a trend towards consolidation - people use fewer applications, but more often and more intensively.  Few people install 10 different food applications, most use only 2 or 3. In addition, the major market players have already taken away most of the audience who are interested in the product.  Then such companies can grow mainly due to new devices, the growth of which is not as fast as before.  Attracting new users also becomes unprofitable - the price for an installation (CPI) is growing.  Therefore, working with current is much more efficient.  Retargeting is a kind of universal solution to the problems that the market is facing today. <br><br>  We collected opinions from representatives of major Russian companies, who shared their vision regarding retargeting as a tool for promotion in mobile. <br><br><h2>  Expert opinions <br></h2><br>  <b>Oleg Track</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Head of Marketing, <a href="https://www.delivery-club.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dohm_adwords%26utm_medium%3Dcpc%26utm_campaign%3DCB_01_RU%26utm_term%3Dcid-335869142::gid-16365140582::c-167875179571::tid-kwd-100080863::lims-::d-c::n-g%26gclid%3DEAIaIQobChMI8ZHyve6p2AIVkB0YCh3XpAZJEAAYASAAEgKS4PD_BwE">Delivery Club</a></b> <br><br>  ‚ÄúMobile retargeting is a fairly new and effective tool for returning users to an application, in which we see enormous potential.  At the moment, it occupies no more than 5% of the marketing costs of the Delivery Club, and should occupy 20%.  Thanks to the Getloyal team for helping us master this tool. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Maxim Pogrebnyak</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Mobile Marketing Manager, <a href="https://www.ozon.ru/">OZON</a></b> <br><br>  ‚ÄúRetargeting is the most important mechanism for users to return to the application.  Attracting newbies is always more expensive, but at the same time most of the money comes from those users who are already loyal to your brand.  Still, companies are investing more in user acquisition, and retargeting is about 10-20% of the total budget. <br><br>  With the development of technology and the overall level of the mobile application market, retargeting is becoming smarter and predictive mathematical models are already being used, which calculate the probability of users returning to the application and correctly distribute the rates for different categories of customers.  In 2018, the personalization vector will continue and this will allow differentiating approaches in targeting. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Oleg Naumov</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Internet Marketing Director,</b> <a href="http://kupivip.ru/">KupiVip</a> <br><br>  ‚ÄúRetargeting very soon may become an integral part of the promotion of mobile applications.  As retargeting tools develop in the app, its share in the sales structure will gradually grow.  Restoring contact with audiences who have already installed the application allows us to solve the problem of increasing the monetization of active customers and reactivation of inactive ones. ‚Äù <br><br>  More and more foreign and domestic companies began to realize the effectiveness of retargeting.  Brands allocate more budget for this technology.  And mobile companies, trackers, and traffic sources, in turn, improve retargeting, developing smart predictive algorithms for returning users to the application.  For example, user segmentation will become even more accurate in 2018.  Advertising formats are more personalized.  Work is also being improved on setting up diplinks and analyzing the effectiveness of retargeting campaigns. <br><br>  In 2017, the myTarget team made a big step in the development of retargeting products: they supported diplinks for iOS and Android, improved the return of users to the application, and implemented statistics on internal myTarget traffic events. <br><br>  <b>Jacob Peysahzon,</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Sales Director,</b> <a href="https://target.my.com/">myTarget</a> . <br><br>  ‚ÄúIn 2018, we plan to develop mobile application retargeting and optimize in-app events.  We are already testing a mobile look-alike, which we will present at the beginning of next year.  Also in the plans for the year - to implement deferred diplinks, allowing the user to open a personalized window after installation on both platforms, and introduce them into the structure of dynamic advertising. <br><br>  Comparing mobile advertising campaigns using retargeting in 2017 with campaigns in 2016, we can note the following dynamics of indicators: achievement of goals increased 40 times, advertising investments increased 13 times, and CPA decreased by 67% ‚Äù <a href="https://target.my.com/">myTarget</a> sales <a href="https://target.my.com/">department</a> . <br><br>  <b>Shani Rosenfelder</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Mobile Insights Lead,</b> <a href="https://www.appsflyer.com/">Appsflyer</a> <br><br>  Expert Appsflyer analyzed that the growth in the use of mobile retargeting in 2017 is 3.5x times higher than last year. <br><br>  ‚ÄúTo date, most mobile marketers have realized that the installation is just one step in their funnel.  The goal is to monetize, especially for the vast majority of applications that earn money through customer purchases and advertising within the application.  If users do not constantly use the mobile application, it becomes extremely difficult to earn income. <br><br>  In addition, the App Store algorithms today focus on engagement with the user.  Not surprisingly, we are seeing an increase in mobile retargeting by 3.5 times, compared with last year.  Thanks to innovations and improvements in diplinks, applications can show personalized advertising to specific users on the desired screen inside the application, which is very important for their retention. ‚Äù <br><br>  Let's take a closer look at the key retargeting trends that will shape its future. <br><br><h2>  Key trends <br></h2><br><h3>  User segmentation <br></h3><br>  Today, many advertising platforms allow you to quickly and easily work with the audience, allow you to download the necessary segments and target specific users.  For example, in 2017, Appsflyer and Adjust launched their Audience Builder, with which you can cut audiences from your own user base and then transfer them to the advertising platform.  Trackers allow you to customize clear segments for in-app events and time periods.  Retargeting using events makes advertisements more accurate, and the conversion is higher. <br><br>  The Appsflyer Audiences tool provides a functional solution for user segmentation.  You can create audiences based on any events in the application that are recorded in AppsFlyer.  With any period filters.  For example: users who put the product in the basket, but did not buy it.  Or users who have installed the application for a specific period, but have not performed the action, etc. <br><br>  Another tracker that allows you to work effectively with dynamic audience segments is the Adjust Audience Builder.  When creating audiences, you can highlight a variety of conditions for targeting, for example: you can make segments by Ad ID and push token, by device type, country, mobile application installation date, last attribution session, event and so on.  In addition, it is possible to apply different types of use of conditions, such as: include, exclude, less than, fewer / more than. <br><br>  Expert <a href="https://www.adjust.com/">Adjust</a> , Leonid Yeletskih, Head of Sales Russia and Eastern Europe: <br>  ‚ÄúIn supporting the trends of personalization, in March 2017 we launched the Audience Builder product.  Our customers, using dynamic audiences, increase the return on advertising campaigns (ROAS) and raise user retention metrics.  For example, a case from Runtastic shows that for the month of using the product, Audience Builder raised the ROAS by an average of 179.1%. <br><br>  Working with an audience, within segmented retargeting and push campaigns, increases the average bill.  This is achieved by using more efficient user interaction, which leads to the final optimization of conversions. ‚Äù <br><br><h3>  Re-engagement <br></h3><br>  TUNE also develops tools to improve retargeting.  The new tool Re-engagement Cohort report, which was launched by the tracker in 2017, allows you to compare and analyze different sources of retargeting by cohort.  For example, in the E-commerce segment we see CPO (order value) from existing users 3-7 times lower than from new ones. <br>  Solutions such as the TUNE Re-engagement Cohort report greatly simplify the analysis of the effectiveness of retargeting campaigns, which is very important for the development of this tool. <br><br><h3>  Efficiency and measurability <br></h3><br>  Deep analytics of retargeting and the correct measurement of its effectiveness is one of the main trends.  Customers will try to set the correct KPI before retargeting and try to measure it correctly.  Two terms that will be used throughout 2018: A / B-test and Incrementality.  To understand the gain from retargeting, you will need to run tests and analyze what gains this launch gives. <br><br>  For example, how to <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/mobio/blog/330970/">measure the effectiveness of a</a> retargeting campaign using an A / B test.  Take half of the users (group A) and launch retargeting for them.  The second half of users (group B) will be left as is, without paid retargeting.  Over time, let's compare the cost of the first order and the ROI in one and in the other group.  If in the group with retargeting the ROI was no lower, then retargeting is justified. <br><br><h3>  Deeplinks <br></h3><br>  In the coming year, diplinks (the technology on which mobile retargeting is based) will be easier to set up and work more reliably.  It will also be possible to measure link clickability.  Yandex AppMetrica, for example, learned how to calculate how many discoveries by Diplink users made from the tracker.  This allows you to determine how effective the advertising banner was. <br><br><h2>  Conclusion <br><br></h2>  Mobile retargeting is the next step in the evolution of mobile marketing.  In 2018, more and more mobile-first companies will look in the direction of retargeting and launch test campaigns.  Retargeting systems and procedures today are becoming more progressive.  The personalization vector will continue to evolve, offering users a great UX, and companies a multiple ROI increase. <br><br>  If you want to start returning users to the app and earn more with mobile retargeting, contact us at <a href="http://getloyal.ru/">Getloyal</a> . <br><br>  The article is also available in English on the <a href="https://www.appnext.com/blog/mobile-re-targeting-will-main-app-marketing-tool-russia-eastern-europe-2018/">Appnext</a> blog. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/345700/">https://habr.com/ru/post/345700/</a></p>
