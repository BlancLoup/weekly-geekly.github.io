  <section class="page js-page"><h1>EMS vs DHL. Or all the delights of courier services</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Several times on Habr√© there were posts about nice DHL.  His sluggishness and constant problems with customs.  I have long and stubbornly doubted the reality of these statements, after all, a large global company.  He doubted until he himself became a tester in his own skin. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  I ordered small things from one very popular Chinese site.  Before that, I read all possible forums on customs legislation, it turned out that, since DHL is not an operator of international postal items (hereinafter, IGOs), the amount of items should be no more than 5,000 rubles.  The amount of my shipment, even taking into account the delivery and commission of Western Union, is exactly $ 80.  Those.  Even with a course of 30 rubles for 1 dollar, it turns out 2100 rubles.  With a clear conscience, I paid through WU, the Chinese received the money, and sent me a package and a track ( <a href="http://www.dhl.ru/publish/ru/ru/eshipping/track.high.html%3FpageToInclude%3DRESULTS%26AWB%3D1223366233%26type%3Dfasttrack">link to tracking DHL</a> ). <br><br>  A day later, the track began to make its way on the site of DHL, the parcel arrived at a staging post in China.  I'm all in anticipation ... But a day passes, then a second ... At the parcel, the status does not change.  The parcel hangs in the warehouse of DHL.  It really starts to disturb me.  I feel that comes true, what I was afraid of.  From September 30, I begin to pull DHL.  I am informed that Volgograd is located in a special economic zone and departures (any) from China do not pass here, except for papers and documents ‚Äî this was told to me by the operator guy.  Everything is very polite.  In the evening I called the hotline, said the same thing, but already the girl, just as politely.  He accepts a request for a problem and advises to wait, as national eight-day holidays begin in China.  I don‚Äôt waste my time, I‚Äôm constantly calling the hotline in Moscow and Volgograd DHL.  Everyone speaks differently each time.  That shipment does not reach at all, it does, but the limit is 135 dollars, let me remind you that my package costs 80 dollars, including shipping.  I ask you to name either the number of the law or the number and the name of their internal order, in connection with which the parcels from China do not arrive in Volgograd - there is no answer.  Muttering something unintelligible.  I continue to communicate with the guy in the position above the operators of the hotline.  Names will not be called, but alas, the package returned to the sender.  It should be given his due, he did everything quickly and clearly and really tried to solve this problem, even after returning the package to the sender, called me and said that the package had been sent by another service, asked for confirmation of the closing of the application.  On the same day, the Chinese sent it by EMS.  Cost 48 dollars against 50 dollars in DHL.  Everything.  The problems are over.  ( <a href="http://www.emspost.ru/tracking/EE241847670CN">link to track EMS</a> ).  Yes, for a long time, but no headache, no ridiculous laws and orders, no problems with customs and delivery, which works even on Sunday and really deliver to the door.  Although shoals happen in EMS.

      PS I confess, the news on the DHL website did not look until shipment.  After sending and starting all these problems, I decided to look.  I focused on the date that the operator casually mentioned - this is somewhere March-April 2009. There is no news related to such problems. <br><br>  Bonus will give a couple of recommendations, how not to get when shopping through the Internet and delivery.  Although many are probably already in the know. <br><br>  1. I advise you to use EMS mail. <br>  2. The amount of the parcel with the delivery is better to put in 10,000 rubles.  (or 5000 rub. If you use DHL, Fedex, UPS) <br>  3. If the amount of the parcel more than 10,000 rubles, you will have to pay a fee, but depends on the circumstances.  The duty will be something like this: the amount of the parcel is 15000 and the duty is paid from the excess amount, i.e.  from 5000 rubles, approximately 30%, provided that you deliver via EMS.  In the case of DHL, you will have to pay a fee on the entire amount. <br><br>  PS After reading the online forums, I realized that problems often happen with DHL, FedEx, UPS and other courier services, which, by the way, work in Russia through one place.  At DHL, with regard to customs clearance through their broker, judging by the reviews, sometimes it almost comes to blackmailing customers, that is, a stupid divorce for money. <br>  Very <a href="http://www.tks.ru/forum/">useful</a> forum <a href="http://www.tks.ru/forum/">www.tks.ru/forum</a> <br>  A lot of interesting things can be found out about customs legislation in general, and about customs in particular. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/74592/">https://habr.com/ru/post/74592/</a></p>
