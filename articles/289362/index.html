We sell sites with a price tag of 100 thousand +, which is higher than the average at the regional level and lower than the mainstream segment in Moscow.  We <a href="http://magwai-promo.ru/">undertake seo</a> projects with a budget of 10 thousand rubles in Volgograd and 17 thousand in the capital. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/449/ef9/0b7/449ef90b763fe124ee111887204317b7.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  How did the leads track? </h4><br>  We tracked visitors to the site using tools: <br><br><ol><li>  Static calltracking </li><li>  Dynamic calltracking </li><li>  e-mail tracking. </li><li>  YandexMetrica. </li></ol>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

      <br>
      Therefore, all the data on the leads that passed through magwai.ru. <br><br>  <b>Static Call Tracking</b> <br>  On the site we substitute phone numbers for each of the advertising sources.  A user who comes from a Google search sees one phone number.  The one who came from social networks is another. <br><br>  For static call-forwarding, we connected the Target Call 2.0 service in YandexMetric.  Replaced the Moscow phone studio. <br><br>  <b>Dynamic Call Tracking</b> <br>  With dynamic call tracking one advertising source has several numbers. <br>  A client who comes from Yandex on the ‚Äúsite creation‚Äù request will see one phone number, the user who made the transition from Yandex on the ‚Äúsite development‚Äù request will see another number a second later. <br><br>  We used the service calltracking.ru. <br><br>  <b>Email tracking</b> <br>  E-mail tracking is tracking letters from the site.  We have developed a script that replaces e-mails.  It works on the principle of static call tracking.  For each advertising channel is assigned 1 e-mail. <br><br>  We chose the following sources for tracking: <br><br><ol><li>  cmsmagazine.ru </li><li>  ratingruneta.ru </li><li>  tagline.ru (and subdomains) </li><li>  Free-lance.ru </li><li>  Revision.ru </li><li>  1c-bitrix.ru </li><li>  YandexDirect </li><li>  Search engines </li><li>  Social networks </li><li>  Copyright on sites. </li></ol><br>  For each source created a separate e-mail.  Added them to external resources where it was possible.  For those customers who write to us immediately, without going to magwai.ru. <br><br>  <b>YandexMetrica</b> <br>  With the help of the metric tracked appeals through the feedback form.  Surprisingly, the number of requests through the form is much less than emails.  I suppose, because on the site the form is present only in contacts. <br><br><h4>  So where do applications come from? </h4><br>  The applications monitored through the site were divided into groups: <br><br><ol><li>  Ratings </li><li>  Search engines </li><li>  Copyright on sites </li><li>  External portfolio (free-lance.ru, revision.ru) </li><li>  YandexDirect </li><li>  Other sites. </li></ol><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/66d/2bb/29d/66d2bb29d068bdef77c5b10a411f4108.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Data for the last six months. <br><br>  <b>Ratings - 34%</b> <br>  We are present in two ratingruneta ratings - Top200 <a href="http://www.ratingruneta.ru/web/">leading Runet studios</a> (70th place) and <a href="http://www.ratingruneta.ru/digital-web-production/2014/">Web Studios Rating</a> working with the largest companies in Russia and the world (59th place).  + Podreytingi by region: in the Southern Federal District and Volgograd we have places in the top five and in development and in seo. <br>  On cmsmagazine.ru these same ratings are in dynamics. <br>  In Tagline we are present in the <a href="http://2014.tagline.ru/design-studios-rating/">rating of design studios in digita</a> l (95th place). <br><br>  In the main rankings, our places are far from the top ten, but this source brings the most bids.  Moreover, quality. <br><br>  The bulk of the leads comes from the Runet Rating. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/c0e/2c4/450/c0e2c445004820ee3cd5d777cc631bd6.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Search engines - 25%</b> <br>  Active site, we have long been promoting.  But visibility in search engines across Volgograd is preserved.  The source is wavy - it is thick, then empty.  More quality leads on seo than on development. <br><br>  <b>Copyright on sites - 12%</b> <br>  I assumed that this source brings more leads.  It turned out that it is not.  Either contact with the studio is delayed in time.  But this is offset by the quality of applications. <br><br>  <b>External portfolio - 17%</b> <br>  In this group I combined accounts on Free-lance.ru and Revision.ru. <br><br>  We pumped an <a href="https://www.fl.ru/users/magwai/">account on freelance</a> back in 2009, for the year reaching the top 10 performers in the category "turnkey websites".  Since then, there are applications of extremely heterogeneous quality. <br><br>  We get adequate and suitable leads for our budgets.  Which are converted into customers.  But there are a lot of applications in the spirit of ‚Äúfix us a script on Jumla, we need tomorrow.‚Äù <br><br>  The channel intensified with the onset of the crisis. <br><br>  On <a href="http://www.revision.ru/s/magwai">Revision account</a> from the end of 2011.  The story is rather an image.  And another account there - the ability to throw a link to customers for a portfolio with large pictures.  Application from there over the past 6 months, only one. <br><br>  <b>Yandex Direct -7%</b> <br>  Tried to advertise for several months through Direct.  Advertising scale on Volgograd and the month on the neighboring regions.  Clicks are expensive, they are relatively small.  Applications substandard.  Wrong budget. <br><br>  I knew that contextual advertising in our subject is primarily aimed at low-budget projects.  But I wanted to try.  Tried, disappointed. <br><br>  <b>Social networks - less than 1%</b> <br>  We support accounts in 4 networks: <a href="https://vk.com/magwaistudio">Vkontakte</a> , <a href="https://twitter.com/magwaistudio">Twitter</a> , <a href="https://www.facebook.com/magwaistudio">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://instagram.com/magwaistudio">Instagram</a> .  Activity is higher in the first two.  In Facebook are often repost from vk.  Instagram semi-neglected. <br><br>  There are no applications for services from social networks.  Just a few pieces, which on the general background tends to zero. <br>  It is necessary to experiment with targeted advertising. <br><br>  <b>1c-bitrix.ru - 0%</b> <br>  As partners 1C-Bitrix we are present in the rating of partners.  Since the places there are low, the leads from the Bitrix site do not come to us. <br>  Companies can respond to requests that customers leave on the site.  Tried to respond to projects, but to no avail. <br><br>  <b>Other sites - 4%</b> <br>  In this group there are applications from customers who have found us in catalogs, reference books, in topics on forums, blogs and where it is still not clear. <br><br><h4>  What else? </h4><br>  <b>Word of mouth</b> <br>  Good old sundress.  As in other industries where they sell services, it works.  And this is a loyal potential customer.  It's simple (but long): the more satisfied customers, the more people recommend you. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/46a/54a/d54/46a54ad5422393b9997ec3c207ef567c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>inforza.ru</b> <br>  Inforza is a service where agencies buy out customer requests at auctions. <br>  We periodically redeem them, but leads into customers are hard to convert.  Piece story.  As an additional source of applications, you can try, but there will not be an order flow from there. <br><br>  <b>Subcontract</b> <br>  They took subcontracts in 2010-2012 from advertising agencies.  Then we tied it up.  The portfolio does not put such work, the deadlines at the agencies often burn. <br><br>  <b>Tenders</b> <br>  On our own initiative, we rarely participate in tenders.  And never in gostenderah.  At one time, we participated in projects on cmsmagazine.ru, but literally 1-2 orders were received from there. <br>  We participate at the invitation of the customer.  About us, he learns from sources that we discussed earlier. <br><br>  <b>Cold calls</b> <br>  Sales experience back in 2009.  There is experience, there is no result.  Sold by phone is hard and ineffective.  Of course, you can find your client anyway, even in a high segment, but we did not succeed. <br><br>  <b>Clients on promotion from development</b> <br>  If the project was done qualitatively, did not screw it up, the terms were not ripped off wildly, then we get a loyal client for promotion.  Loyal customers - this is a significant source of applications for online advertising.  Sell ‚Äã‚Äãthem easier and more enjoyable. <br>  The channel brings up to 40-50% of clients per seo and context. <br><br><h4>  Brief summary </h4><br>  You may have completely different channels, depending on the activity in different directions.  But always the most loyal customers will be those who came through word of mouth on the recommendation and copyright on sites. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/289362/">https://habr.com/ru/post/289362/</a></p>
