  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The consequences of blocking Telegram</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hi, GeekTimes!  A week has already passed since the beginning of the confrontation between Telegram and Roskomnadzor.  I admit, I really waited for the end of a certain period from the moment of blocking, in order to observe the consequences.  Will they be equally positive for Telegram?  Why the same and why positive?  - Because the precedent has already been. <br><br>  I will duplicate the <a href="https://t.me/groks/294">recording of</a> July 2017 from my <a href="https://t.me/groks/">@Groks</a> channel: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/oj/ev/iv/ojevivwucdgx4e9iuwxol0wc5ni.jpeg"><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">For iOS</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/k-/ke/du/k-kedusr8m5r_n7avulsjynf75o.png"><br></div></div><br><blockquote>  Probably everyone has already heard about the blocking of the Telegram in Indonesia.  What amazes me is how the growth of downloads of the application is increasing against the background of this news, especially in countries where this application is blocked.  The image above shows 2 Graphs of Rank History according to AppAnnie for iOS and Android devices. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In Russia, growth began with the relevant statements of Roskomnadzor at the end of June.  In Indonesia - with news about local groups of ISIS, which use the service Durov.  One of these I found on June 23 at Malay Mail Online.  Even more characteristic are the peaks that became the result of the blocking theme visible on Google Trends.  And no wonder, because everyone speaks about this: WSJ, CNN, ABC, Fortune, Reuters, BBC, Washington Post, New York Times and many others. </blockquote><br><h2>  the Forbidden fruit is sweet </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pq/af/hi/pqafhiwvioaqmuojnspn2npuzf4.png"><br>  <i>Telegram and VPN topics in Google Trends</i>

      Probably only a person completely isolated from the Internet and television is not aware of the latest events.  Digital resistance has spread throughout the country.  According to Google Trends, VPN-related queries have grown multiply.  But what happens to Telegram itself in Russia? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ai/qn/e-/aiqne-n6a0ligsbstowbrcfviem.png"><br>  <i>Ranking Positions Telegram and Telegram X in the US for Android</i> <br><br>  If you believe SimilarWeb, then its Android audience is growing, because Telegram X downloads are growing in Google Play.  True, there is a slight drop in the App Store.  Also worth mentioning is the <a href="https://vc.ru/36598-statistika-aktivnost-v-telegram-v-rossii-vyrosla-posle-blokirovki">data</a> from Combot, TGStat and Telemetr.  These services indicate an increase in the daily coverage of channels by 20% and an increase in subscribers by 39%. <br><br>  It turns out that the overall situation is stable or even positive for our country.  With Russia sorted out.  But after all, the pillars of the western media sphere cite the blocking news with gusto.  Therefore, it is curious to find out whether such unobtrusive advertising influenced the popularity of Telegram there in the USA? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lx/m-/qs/lxm-qsot5zamc4wnd4hnckz2mhs.png"><br>  <i>Positioning Telegram and Telegram X in the USA for iOS</i> <br><br>  I draw your attention to the fact that if in Russia Telegram X has risen from some place to the 70th place, then in the USA to 6 in the App Store!  Moreover, a similar phenomenon is observed in the UK, Canada and Australia.  And this is usually the most difficult and expensive markets.  Go ahead: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ig/qz/cn/igqzcnttdi_xkqqhiqls26gj-la.png"><br>  <i>Ranking Positions Telegram and Telegram X in the US for Android</i> <br><br>  When trying to get position data on Google Play, I encountered a SimilarWeb bug or some specific service features, the essence of which I don‚Äôt understand.  In the parameters there are 2 Telegram clients, and the schedule is built only one by one.  However, the upward trend is also noticeable.  And not only in the United States, but also in the Anglo-Saxon countries listed above. <br><br>  No less interesting is happening in Europe.  To display a group of countries on a single chart, I switched to App Annie and selected only those countries where Telegram was popular to a certain extent (Germany, Italy, Spain).  It's not all so clear, but it is obvious that the right is narrower than the left (I am a professional).  So there is growth, as in many other regions of the planet, which reach our news about the ILV. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fk/aw/17/fkaw17jlvythvjrnezsb2q-cob0.png"><br>  <i>App Store</i> <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Google play</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/k-/ke/du/k-kedusr8m5r_n7avulsjynf75o.png"><br></div></div><br><h2>  Apotheosis </h2><br>  Now everything seems obvious, but how ingenious it is to build Telegram's marketing on security, strengthening this with the image of an iron curtain refugee.  Any restriction of this security for citizens is a matter of freedom, which is widely circulated in the media.  Except for conspiracy problems, I am sure that maps are still well placed here.  I mean the popularity of the product among the banned groups and counteraction to this by the states. <br><br>  I am surprised by the human nature, and more precisely our behavioral factors and motives of coherence.  The use of Telegram by terrorists becomes a guarantee of confidentiality of the service.  Although I am convinced that for the overwhelming majority, security is more ‚Äúbright packaging‚Äù than the main value of the content (if you are not the wrongdoer). <br><br>  Recall that famous Macintosh ad in 1984 shown at the Super Bowl.  Steve Jobs played the same to us: ‚ÄúBig Brother‚Äù, the blue giant IBM, total control and Apple, as a complete opposition to these phenomena.  Then the Internet as such was not, but there were stereotypes and fears.  And we have all been identified for a long time, at least on passports. <br><br>  If we decompose any brand into semantic layers, we will certainly find in the center of its communication at least one of human vices, such as laziness, greed, self-love or fear, which are essentially the basis of commodity-money relations.  And having dug deeper, we will fall into the realm of the subconscious, which is largely responsible for our security and basic behavior. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/357998/">https://habr.com/ru/post/357998/</a></p>
