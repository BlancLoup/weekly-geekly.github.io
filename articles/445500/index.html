      <br>
      In 2009, I sat down and wrote the first few lines of <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/you-know-for-search">Elasticsearch and opened its sources</a> .  I quit my job and spent two years investing in product creation and helping the wonderful community that was built around it.  In 2012, we <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/you-know-for-search-inc">created the Elastic company</a> .  We have invested in our user community and built an ecosystem of open source products developed around it.  We added so many features to Apache Lucene that I lost count, creating a solid foundation for our solution.  We added Kibana, created by <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/author/rashid-khan">Rashid</a> , <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/welcome-jordan-logstash">Logstash, created by Jordan</a> , and <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/welcome-packetbeat-tudor-monica">PacketBeat, created by Monica and Tudor</a> , and more.  We created products, communities around them, and focused on ensuring that our users get the most benefit.  Today we have hundreds of Elastic developers who are working on this extensive commitment every day.  We have hundreds of thousands of community members contributing to our mutual success every day.  And I am proud of the company <a href="https://www.elastic.co/about/our-source-code">we have created</a> to contribute to this. <br><br>  We built a trust level with our users, whom I am proud of and admire.  We must start with the fact that we are open, and continue to be honest with our community and users in what we do.  We also focused on nothing to distract us from this. <br><br>  Since we started, for many years we have been dealing with <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/FUD">FUD</a> .  If you create something successful, it will definitely happen.  FUD mainly comes from (more) large companies that are afraid of what such a move might make.  This is a natural process.  "Do not use the product, it is a toy."  ‚ÄúHe has only a few developers, what happens if they get hit by a bus?‚Äù ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt know what an ‚Ä≥ Enterprise wants.‚Äù  "They are not true X or Y or Z (enter your word of the day)."  We never let it affect us or occupy our thoughts.  This is done in order to distract us and our community from the main goal: to create great products and communities that users love so much.  If we allow this to happen, we will just let our users down, and we will never let you down. <br><br>  Our products have been forked, redistributed and repacked so many times that I lost count.  This is a sign of the success and scale of our products.  From various vendors to large Chinese companies, which now include Amazon.  There was always a ‚Äúreason‚Äù, sometimes disguised as false altruism or benevolence.  None of them (meaning "causes" - <i>approx. Lane.</i> ) Did not last.  They (solutions based on Elastic products) were created to meet their own needs, contribute to confusion and destroy the community.  Our commitment and focus on creating great products and communities that users like, have shaped our path, and this has resonated with you, our users.  We have reached the trust level (communication) with you, the expected level of innovation and tremendous cooperation, which is just there, and you saw it. <br><br>  We believe in <a href="https://www.elastic.co/about/why-open-source">open source</a> and the power it brings.  We also reported from the very beginning that some features will be commercial and why.  I believe that our honesty is one of the main reasons for our overall success.  We have created our open source code so that it is easily pluggable and implementable.  From the very beginning, we have not changed our way, strengthening the confidence of our users over the years, that we remain true to our word and to them. <br><br>  Our commercial code was a ‚Äúsource of inspiration‚Äù for others, it was blindly copied by various companies and even went back to certain distribution options or forks, such as, for example, just stamped by Amazon, unfortunately, with critical bugs.  We continued to focus on creating great products and communities that users like.  We did not allow this to distract us, and this trick paid off tenfold. <br><br>  Our brand was used and insulted, stolen and distorted information about it many times.  Companies falsely claim to work in cooperation with our company, in particular, <a href="https://twitter.com/Werner/status/649738362086027265">Amazon</a> .  We did not allow this to distract us, we continued to create great products and communities that users like.  Weakening of the focus is the enemy of the company, and we never allow it to influence us.  Only our users are important, not the noise around. <br><br>  When we joined forces with companies, we discovered the code.  When we saw our users using us for APM, we were all excited about this.  We combined our efforts with a fully SaaS-based company in the APM field called OpBeat, which was a major commercial investment on our part, and most of this code was made <a href="https://github.com/opbeat">publicly available</a> , and all this for free.  It was a simple decision, because we are focused on creating great products and communities that users like, and you, our users, deserve it. <br><br>  When the others closed, <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/doubling-down-on-open">we opened</a> .  We retained our open source code under the same license and doubled our openness as a company.  We re-licensed our existing commercial code under a less strict license and opened the code.  We are trying to create the same level of collaboration and transparency as in our open source code in everything we do.  This is a backlash to the many discussions that we had with our users, and I am so glad that this has caused you a great response.  Since then, our level of investment in open source has only increased, as has our commitment to freer functions and experiences that are clearly and understandably distributed. <br><br>  When companies came to us after seeing our success, and asked to establish special working relationships for working together on the code, demanding preferences that would put them above our users, we said ‚Äúno‚Äù to them.  This has happened many times over the years, and only recently again, this time from Amazon.  Some have <a href="https://github.com/elastic/kibana/issues/6515">joined</a> and become wonderful partners for us and the community.  Others, unfortunately, did not follow this path.  We have a commitment that we will relate to one developer who contributes to the development of our products, as well as to all the others.  There are no preferences, and we will reject any request for its availability.  Our response has always been a constant: send a pull request, like everyone else.  Quality will speak for itself. <br><br>  I write all this for several reasons.  First, we all sometimes need to think about what we have done and why, what made us successful, to make sure that we stay true to our course.  To you, our users, our community, our company.  Secondly, for everyone else who may be distracted from the essence of various reasons that to maintain concentration and remain honest - this is the only thing that matters.  Finally, to express our common desire to continue to create great products and communities that users like.  This is our <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2598%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25BA%25D1%2583%25D1%2580%25D1%2581">true course</a> . <br><br>  In Elastic there is always a zero day (as well as the developers we help, we use numbering from scratch).  Nothing has changed since the first line of code I wrote during the 10-year journey that we walked with all of you, our users, and many years ahead will not change.  I ‚ô° all of you. <br><br><blockquote>  The text was added a few links that were not in the original post.  This should not change the essence of the text. </blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/445500/">https://habr.com/ru/post/445500/</a></p>
