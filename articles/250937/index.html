We have news from the Urals :) <br><br>  Conference for developers <a href="http://dump-conf.ru/">DUMP</a> (Development. Usability. Management. Practice) will be held on March 20 in Yekaterinburg.  This year we celebrate our anniversary - already the fifth spring we collect the Ural (and not only) IT specialists in one place and share our experience.  So cook congratulations, the cake will be :) <br><br>  Surely many have already been to DUMP, so we will not talk about his story in detail.  Who has not been and does not know what it is - here is the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/it_people/blog/216893">report</a> on DUMP-2014, where everything is told.  But an excellent movie that conveys the atmosphere of last year‚Äôs conference.

Join now! <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  <b>What will happen this year?</b> </h4><br>  First, we made a new <a href="http://dump-conf.ru/">site</a> .  Stylish, fashionable, youth. <br><br>  Secondly, we remain at the former site of the huge Yekaterinburg-EXPO - so that everyone has enough space, and this year we expect as many as 1000 participants. <br><br>  Thirdly, this year the reports will be presented in 7 sections, in which 70 speakers will speak. <br><br> <a href="https://fotki.yandex.ru/next/users/it-people-ekb/album/417302/view/814679%3Fpage%3D5"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/22b/424/9c8/22b4249c80201227a99c8caca6541c99.jpg" width="500" height="333" title="IMG_1331.jpg" alt="IMG_1331.jpg"></a> <br><h6>  Development Management Section at DUMP-2014 </h6><br>  Traditionally, each section has a program director (or several) who select the reports, help the speakers prepare for the presentation, and in general, do a lot of important work. <br><br><h5>  Responsible for this year's section: </h5>  ‚Ä¢ FrontTalks - Oleg Mokhov (Yandex); <br>  ‚Ä¢ Serverside - Alexey Spiridonov (JetStyle), Pavel Egorov (SKB Kontur), Andrey Fefelov (Abak Press), Daniil Skrobov (Nevesta.info); <br>  ‚Ä¢ development management - Ksenia Kudinova (IT People); <br>  ‚Ä¢ testing - Ilya Vakhrushev (Exadel), Maxim Zakharov (Yandex); <br>  ‚Ä¢ design - Ramil Shaikhutdinov (SKB Kontur); <br>  ‚Ä¢ system analysis - Daria Kotlyarova (Ural-Siberian geoinformation company). <br><br>  This year, we conditionally decided to divide the Serverside section into Hardcore- and -Light-versions, so that the developer could find an interesting topic for himself as a developer of a large software company, as well as a representative of a small web-studio.  Our main audience is developers, and their interests are very different.  So that at each moment in time both for C # and for the Python programmer there was something tasty, in order to have time to talk about databases, about DevOps, and about load optimization, we decided to make two tracks about backend. <br><br>  The program is actively being formed.  Here are a few already approved reports: <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Oleg Tsarev</b> , Mail.Ru.  Using the social graph of classmates in Target Mail.Ru; <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Svetlana Isakova</b> , JetBrains.  In simple words about type inference; <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Dmitry Dudin</b> , XB Software, Minsk.  Optimization of download speed and initial rendering of web pages; <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Denis Chistyakov</b> , Yandex.  Profiling Node.js or how we overclocked from 400rps to 1100rps. <br><br> <a href="https://fotki.yandex.ru/next/users/it-people-ekb/album/169532/view/980157"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/431/0a1/a10/4310a1a1012162e69961b348c48d7715.jpg" width="500" height="333" title="0_c6e24_fd20a18b_orig.jpg" alt="0_c6e24_fd20a18b_orig.jpg"></a> <br><h6>  Speaker Ilya Krasinsky, DUMP-2014 </h6><br><br><h4>  <b>I want to speak at DUMP-2015</b> </h4><br>  The program directors of each section identified some topics that we would be interested to hear this year (the design and spelling of the authors are preserved). <br><br>  So, <br><h5>  <b>FrontTalks:</b> </h5>  Hello!  We, Oleg Mokhov and Valeria Atamanova, work in Yandex and present the FrontTalks section at the DUMP-2015 conference.  Last year, the section under our leadership turned out to be extremely interesting, and we intend to repeat the success. <br><br>  Of course, you are aware of the many changes in the world of Frontend.  Web components are sweeping across the planet, ECMAScript 6 implementation continues, React has entered into an unequal battle with Angular.js, and upstart io.js will try to fray with the already familiar node.js.  Do not share anywhere and problems with old browsers - IE8 is still alive and bothering us.  We are sure that you did not stay aside from the trends, and during the year did a lot of interesting things that you would like to tell your colleagues. <br><br>  For all those who wish to speak and share progressive ideas and best practices, our mail fronttalks@ya.ru works.  And we are waiting for everyone else at the conference.  We guarantee a rich program and fruitful communication. <br><br><h5>  <b>Design:</b> </h5>  A few years ago, there were few UX / UI specialists, and this area was actively developing.  Today, interfaces have occupied almost the most important place in the process of developing any product or even service.  We can say that in our relatively young industry, it is time for youth. <br><br>  Where are we and what will happen next?  What are the possibilities of applying our knowledge, and in what direction will the industry develop together with us?  What tools have we begun to use, and what are we still lacking?  At the conference, we propose to consider this period of development from all sides, be it working with users, researching or working with a specific tool. <br><br><h5>  <b>Development Management:</b> </h5>  In this section, we are waiting for reports for managers of development teams, team leaders, project managers, developers who are interested in management problems, as well as for business owners and / or those who are going to ‚Äúgo free floating‚Äù and start their own business.  Let's talk about how realistic it is to become a good team leader.  Let's look at the development "from the outside."  Let's try to reduce the level of uncertainty in the work of the manager.  Pay attention to the business aspects that may affect the management of development.  Of course, this is only the tip of the iceberg.  Representatives of companies of various sizes are ready to share their experience again and tell you how not to step on the ‚Äúrake‚Äù at all or at least!  - do it carefully. <br><br><h5>  <b>Serverside:</b> </h5>  - We cut costs in a crisis: how to save on infrastructure and tools; <br>  - Prepare and compare programming languages; <br>  - Voice recognition, extraction of facts from the text, machine learning in advisory (and not only) services; <br>  - Collecting statistics online and using column databases for this, processing large data using Apache Spark, Hadoop and others; <br>  - DevOps - how to implement and what to eat; <br>  - Architecture, microservice and no; <br>  - Database sharding is an eternal topic; <br>  - Flow algorithms: hyperLogLog and Bloom filter.  What development tasks can be solved with their help; <br>  - HHVM and project translation to it (or other virtual machines: kphp, phpng); <br><br><h5>  <b>Testing:</b> </h5>  - Performance testing for the smallest; <br>  - How to avoid bug-driven development; <br>  - What do manual testers learn and where do they grow? <br>  - Holivar with managers and programmers about the ideal tester; <br>  - The system of continuous integration as a project rhythm and method of communication; <br>  - Security testing necessary and sufficient.  Where to begin; <br>  - On the metrics and performance evaluation testers; <br>  - How to distribute tasks and maintain interest: motivation, carrots, gingerbread. <br><br><h5>  <b>Analytics:</b> </h5>  - Big data analysis.  The use of mathematical tools <br>  - Approaches to documenting the project at different stages of development <br>  - Is the analyst also a usability?  Relationship analysts and usability in your company <br>  - Interaction of analysts in a distributed team <br>  - And the eternal theme: requirements management tools and practices <br><br>  Any format of performance is possible: a sectional report (40 min), a blitz report (10-20 minutes), a master class.  We will be happy to learn from you something new, any interesting practice that you discovered for yourself in the past year. <br><br>  If you have something to tell about one of these topics - immediately apply <a href="http://dump-conf.ru/">here</a> or write to elena@it-people.ru.  Applications for reports are accepted until February 24. <br><br>  If you have an interesting report on a topic not stated above, write anyway - it is possible that the program committee will decide that your report will be super useful and will be included in the program. <br><br> <a href="https://fotki.yandex.ru/next/users/it-people-ekb/album/169532/view/980159"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c4c/23d/9f2/c4c23d9f2d7ed56ecb5dccb2221535c5.jpg" width="500" height="333" title="0_c6edc_e5440c05_orig.jpg" alt="0_c6edc_e5440c05_orig.jpg"></a> <br><h6>  One of the brightest speakers of the last year - Andrey Sitnik </h6><br><h5>  <b>I want to become a sponsor of DUMP-2015</b> </h5><br>  We are looking for sponsors and partners for whom the love and respect of IT specialists are important.
