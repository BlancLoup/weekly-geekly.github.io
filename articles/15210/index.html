  <section class="page js-page"><h1>5 principles of a successful PR photo</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <strong>1. A top manager should look like a man.</strong> <br>  One cannot neglect this simple and obvious rule: the person depicted in the photo should look like a person, and not a wax figure with a tense smile sitting in an unnatural posture.  Open any magazine, and see how many photos there are, in which top managers are depicted as mannequins or other inanimate objects that they tried to fit into the interior of the office.  Stretched facial expressions and unnatural gestures are the main enemies of successful photos. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <strong>2. The picture should illustrate the words.</strong>  <strong>Or at least not contradict them.</strong> <br>  An image to an article (an interview or just a quote) should help translate words into images.  Therefore, if the commentary concerns the stock market crash, then a wide smile of the speaker is unlikely to be appropriate.  Also, a representative of the IT department, photographed at a desktop without a computer, can look quite silly. <br>  Submit a comment to your speaker along with a photo.  They form a single image.  What is the background?  How is the expert dressed?  What are his gestures? <br>  If the topic is serious, demonstrating the analytical skills and erudition of the speaker, then the photo should be official.  If the conversation in the interview is about privacy, sports, hobbies, demonstrate that the expert is an ordinary person, with open gestures, dressed in Friday casual. <br><br>  <strong>3. Do not forget that photography is an art.</strong> <br>  This means that the PR photo should be original, but within the first two principles.  Scroll through any magazine, and fix on the photos of experts that you will come across.  Surely, among your thoughts there will be such: ‚Äúa photo on documents‚Äù, ‚Äúwhat a terrorist!‚Äù, And in that spirit ... <br>  The photo should convey the emotions of the person in the frame, and the reader should be formed with the confidence that he can trust the words of the expert.

      <strong>4. Trust a professional.</strong> <br>  It is better to pay for the photo session of all public people of the organization to a professional photographer, and not feel ashamed when sending photos to journalists.  A professional will expose the right light, find a good angle for a person, cause the right emotions.  After the photo shoot will process the files.  And a professional photographer will have a high-quality camera, which will positively affect the quality of images. <br>  Order a selection of black and white and color photographs.  B / W - for newspapers, color - for magazines, web publications and newspapers in color. <br>  In addition, do not forget that we need plans of different size.  Some publication will want to insert a 3x4 photo, somewhere more appropriate would be a waist-length photo. <br>  Before you trust a professional, make sure of his professionalism: look at the portfolio, get recommendations.  A good photographer will not be cheap, but the most expensive photographer may not be the most suitable.  It is best to contact a photographer from a magazine or newspaper where you most often send photos of your speakers. <br><br>  <strong>5. Hold photo shoots regularly.</strong> <br>  People age, change hair color, grow bald, some become overgrown with bristles.  If you want your company experts to be recognized in person, regularly update your photo archive. <br>  Establish a rule according to which a new public person of a company is obliged to take a picture with your photographer.  I do not envy, if you get the speaker with your photo archive, you may not be lucky if there are poor-quality photos (especially those that contradict the first principle).  And if a person insists that he is not going to take a photo, treat his refusal philosophically - when a person with a camera turns around, it‚Äôs really not very pleasant.  If you are a PR specialist, you will find arguments on how to convince him to take a photo. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/15210/">https://habr.com/ru/post/15210/</a></p>
