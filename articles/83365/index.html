    <h3>  Rapid Software Testing </h3><br>  Excellent testing can be tricky.  You may be confused or confused by the huge variety of approaches to planning testing, designing and executing tests.  Perhaps you work in an environment where not everyone ‚Äúplays by the rules‚Äù or where testing is constantly under the pressure of time and resource constraints.  Perhaps you are experiencing difficulties because you do not know how to answer questions like ‚Äúhow much time do you need for testing?‚Äù Or ‚Äúwhy did you miss this defect?‚Äù Perhaps you have found that ‚Äúbest industry practices‚Äù are not applicable or poorly suited to your organization, and books, courses, and certifications in the field of testing are focused on the study of terminology and do not contain exercises, experiments, and thinking techniques that help you learn to <em>test</em> . <br><br>  Want to learn how to effectively perform testing in an environment where you are faced with a lack of information and a lack of time?  Want to become a <em>real ace</em> in testing?  In this case, Rapid Software Testing ‚Äî the methodology and training course developed by James Bach and Michael Bolton ‚Äî is for you. <br><br><h3>  About the course </h3><br>  Rapid testing is a methodology that considers testing as a complex mental activity.  It is designed for use in modern testing, when we are dealing with complex products, constant changes and the rapid development of projects.  This training course outlines the testing approach, starting with the development of personal skills and continuing awareness of the global role of testing: highlighting the path a project takes, through product evaluation.  This approach follows many of the concepts and principles described in the book Lessons Learned in Software Testing: a Context-Driven Approach (Kaner, Bach, Petticord). <br><br>  The philosophy pursued by this course is not similar to traditional approaches to testing, ignoring the part of our work related to <em>thinking</em> , and offering instead an endless stream of paperwork.  Products become too complex to follow traditional approaches, time is too short, and testers are too expensive.  Rapid testing uses a cyclical approach and heuristic techniques to constantly optimize testing in an effort to achieve full compliance with the needs of your customers.  Rapid testing is not just testing with great speed or urgency, it is testing focused on goals, eliminating unnecessary work, ensuring that everything really needed is done, and constantly wondering what testing can do to speed up a project as a whole. <br><br><h3>  You will learn‚Ä¶ </h3><ul><li>  How to focus on goals and start testing any product or system as quickly as possible. </li><li>  How to choose and use the most effective heuristics, models and techniques for rapid test design </li><li>  How to test at the highest level, despite the ambiguous, insufficient or ever-changing requirements </li><li>  How to deal with the exorbitant complexity or complexity of programs </li><li>  How to decide when to start, pause and stop testing, or how to continue, despite the obstacles </li><li>  How to prepare and submit a credible test report at any time. </li></ul><br><h3>  If you work in a company with stringent process requirements ... </h3><br>  We conducted this training course in organizations that follow the CMMI model, in organizations that must comply with the requirements of the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) and other regulators.  Rapid testing is a technique of <em>thinking</em> , so they are quite compatible with formalized processes.  If the project manager expects from you that you will think well and quickly identify important problems, our training course and our methodology will be great for you.  Yes, we are promoting the reduction of test documentation to the minimum possible level, but only to the extent that you can fully meet the requirements of the customer and fulfill your mission.  We also teach the session-oriented test management style, which allows us to measure and document testing using the free search method and create reports on the work done in an understandable and easily identifiable form. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.developsense.com/courses/RapidSoftwareTesting.pdf">The official announcement of the training and the detailed program in English</a> <br><br><h3>  The terms of participation </h3><br>  Place: Moscow <br>  Date: March 11-12 <br>  Time: 09:00 - 17:00 <br>  Training will be held in English <br><br>  <b>The cost of participation in a two-day training:</b> <br><br>  17 000 rubles for registration and payment until February 20, <br>  19 000 rubles for registration and payment before March 1 <br>  21 000 rubles for registration and payment until March 11. <br><br>  The cost of training includes lunches, coffee breaks, as well as dinner after the second day of training. <br><br>  <b>Bonuses !!!</b> <br><br>  The first five registered 10% discount. <br><br>  With simultaneous registration and payment of two participants 10% discount. <br><br>  <a href="http://software-testing.ru/events/930-rapid-software-testing">The official announcement of the training</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/83365/">https://habr.com/ru/post/83365/</a></p>
