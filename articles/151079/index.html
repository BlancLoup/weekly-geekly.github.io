Close to topic</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Interactive games with augmented reality.  Part 1.  Introductory. <br><br>  Good day, dear readers!  I propose to create together a series of topic-seminars, the information in which will be supplemented as the discussion of the topic given in it is discussed.  Let's start. <br><br>  The topic of <u>augmented reality</u> ( <u>augmented reality</u> , <u>AR</u> , hereinafter I will often abbreviate as <u>DR</u> , and sometimes I will use the term ‚Äúaugmented reality‚Äù) was touched on Habr√© more than once, but since the topic is very extensive, we can say a lot about it In spite of the fact that I wanted to start writing about it back in 2008. <br>  First I will try to compile the available information.  Also, in the first parts, I would like to speculate about the possibility of using DR in real time for interactive entertainment, including games, solving some practical problems, as well as for orientation both in the city and in nature, the number of traversed and wooded areas.  If everything goes smoothly, we will get to practice.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e53/eb3/408/e53eb34086fbd58e3744d0127af7c6c1.jpg"><br><br>  In the water part, I will try to explain some terms that are important for understanding what the DR is all the same, and I will also bring to the public some of my personal judgments, possibly very controversial.  Some issues related to pattern recognition and equipment will also be partially addressed here.  We will also try to figure out what the DR is like right now and try to imagine how these technologies can evolve in the future. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Remark</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Today it is difficult to imagine a habrechelovek, although not remotely aware of what Augmented Reality is.  But, unfortunately, for many it is seen simply as an additional feature in mobile devices, which helps to have fun by imposing some effects on the image received from the camera of this very device.  As a rule, everything is limited to simple ‚Äútoys‚Äù with the replacement of one object (say, a sheet of paper with a certain pattern) with another one and, possibly, even with some very limited interaction.  In the best cases, the first object will be, for example, the wall of a building, when focusing on which marks left by other people will be displayed, which may be useful when navigating.  We will not dwell more on this now, so as not to repeat the material of articles that are already on this resource.  However, the possibilities of DR on this is not limited. <br><br></div></div><br><br>  So, augmented or augmented reality is a general term that refers to projects related to the addition of three-dimensional reality visible to us by certain virtual two-dimensional and three-dimensional objects and elements.  Often these objects are, for example, text prompts with a description of objects around us (original labels) or other useful and not very information (Name of the current composition in your headphones, currency exchange rate in real time, contextual advertising of diapers when you pass by store).  More rarely - interactive virtual objects (we will get to them too). <br><br>  Most often, we can find the DR in the form of applications for mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, which complement the picture obtained by means of the camera with some information, according to the functions, algorithms and capabilities of the software (hereinafter referred to as software).  Increasingly, elements of the DR appear in product presentations and exhibitions. <br>  For example, the work of ‚ÄúAR Studio‚Äù by EligoVision at the presentation of the Olympic University is indicative. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Video1</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/PihcWSdyU_w%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgvSwFlhw6GDzf4MSym7gCTE8swiQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br></div></div><br>  ... By the way, I suggest we invite the guys to the Habra Club, and officially, as I see it, they are not represented here. <br>  Another video on the topic, already recorded broadcast Vesti.ru: <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Video2</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/O4CcStOXvDw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhg0s6gvja_6KZrgZws9kKV5zh1hgQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br></div></div><br><br>  If you follow the path of development of the DR in the civil sphere to this day, you can understand what awaits us in the near future.  I see at least three things that are impossible to ignore, because sooner or later they can touch us all: <br>  1) The technologies of augmented reality smoothly move in the direction of augmented virtuality, when already virtual reality is complemented by objects from real reality.  At some point it may turn out that we will cease to perceive reality in isolation from virtual additions to it.  This is still far, of course, but only by the standards of technology development rates. <br>  2) Augmented reality is becoming more interactive, which opens up new perspectives for it and gives it the opportunity to ‚Äúintegrate‚Äù into many aspects of our life, in addition to the existing ones - navigation, games, entertainment, training, medicine, and others. <br>  3) With the development of technology, augmented reality is becoming more accessible to the average person. <br><br>  Today, almost everyone can join the DR, with the help of their computer, tablet or smartphone, while being free.  And those who want to join in a more sophisticated way - they can already create their unpretentious glasses and helmets of augmented reality, without spending thousands of dollars on it.  Topics on Habr√© were already, so I will not repeat, if not asked. <br>  That is, in the simplest case, we need to have three things that already exist in any smartphone: <br>  1) A camera that will capture the environment by recording the image from the reality surrounding us. <br>  2) A hardware and software system that will take the image from the camera, modify and supplement it, according to the algorithms embedded in the software and output it to ... <br>  3) A screen capable of presenting the processed information visually. <br><br>  We are most interested in the second paragraph, because with the other two everything is more than clear (in the context of this part of the article) <br><br>  The power of even the simplest modern smartphones, tablets and, even more so, computers are already quite sufficient to process the real-time video stream received from the HD camera and add simple elements like tags, pictures, geometric shapes and low-poly 3D models, and in some cases - beyond recognition, change the entire scene surrounding you, displaying the resulting information on the screen of your device, TV or sending, say, in the form of video broadcast, to your website on the Internet, helping, in theory, to add  Come to extended reality for all its visitors. <br><br>  The situation is somewhat more complicated with software: The accessible, simple and understandable DR programs are now disastrously small, and they are mainly not oriented at the average user.  But the current situation is changing rapidly and, quite likely, as early as next year, everyone will be able to ‚Äúsurprise‚Äù their friends with the virtual zoo created by him in his yard, directing the eye of the tablet camera on the sandbox with children. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dbc/58c/5ce/dbc58c5ce559f552cba285bec9074222.png"><br><br>  At this introductory part is over.  Waiting for your comments and additions.  We will jointly form the following parts. <br><br>  PS I ask to forgive for possible and, most likely, lexical, grammatical and other errors that occur, as well as I ask you to report them in a message to the PM or use the extension previously advertised for your browser more than once. <br>  PPS Thanks to <i><u>Georgy Mashkovtsev</u></i> ( <a href="http://george973.artphoto.pro/">http://george973.artphoto.pro</a> ) for the photo with monkeys.  And many thanks for the invite to Habr to all those involved in it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/151079/">https://habr.com/ru/post/151079/</a></p>
