      <b>Interviewer:</b> I must tell you that we are working in a division engaged in the construction of a large number of brown houses.  Have you ever built lots of brown houses? <br>  <b>Carpenter:</b> Well, I'm a carpenter - I build houses, and people already paint them as they wish. <br><br>  <b>Interviewer:</b> Yes, I understand, but could you tell me how much experience you have with brown ones?  Well, give or take. <br>  <b>Carpenter:</b> I really have no idea.  From the moment the house is built, I do not care what color it is painted.  Maybe six months? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Interviewer:</b> Six months?  Actually, we are looking for someone with a much more brown experience, but let me ask you some more questions. <br>  <b>Carpenter:</b> Okay.  But, you know, painting is painting. <br><br>  <b>Interviewer:</b> Yes, yes, good.  What about Nut? <br>  <b>Carpenter:</b> What about him? <br><br>  <b>Interviewer:</b> Have you worked a lot with a walnut tree? <br>  <b>Carpenter:</b> Of course.  Walnut, pine, oak, mahogany - anything. <br><br>  <b>Interviewer:</b> But how many years have you worked with Walnut? <br>  <b>Carpenter:</b> I don‚Äôt know, damn it.  Am I supposed to count every board? <br><br>  <b>Interviewer:</b> Well, at least approximately? <br>  <b>Carpenter:</b> Well, then I would say that I have a year and a half of experience working with a walnut tree. <br><br>  <b>Interviewer:</b> But you are not a nutty guru? <br>  <b>Carpenter:</b> Well, I'm a carpenter - I work with any types of wood, which, of course, have some differences, but I think that if you are a good carpenter ... <br><br>  <b>Interviewer:</b> Yes, yes, but we use a walnut tree.  This is normal? <br>  <b>Carpenter:</b> Walnut is beautiful!  Whatever you want, I'm a carpenter. <br><br>  <b>Interviewer:</b> What about Black Nut? <br>  <b>Carpenter:</b> What about him? <br><br>  <b>Interviewer:</b> We had several nut carpenters, but then it turned out by chance that they were not carpenters for the black walnut.  Do you have experience with it? <br>  <b>Carpenter:</b> Of course, a bit.  I guess it would be nice to have more experience for my resume. <br><br>  <b>Interviewer:</b> Okay.  Let me check the list of questions. <br>  <b>Carpenter:</b> Yes please. <br><br>  <b>Interviewer:</b> So, the last question for today.  We use Stone 5.1 for nailing.  Did you use Stone 5.1? <br>  <b>Carpenter:</b> <i>[turning pale ...]</i> Well, I know that a lot of carpenters started using stones to hammer in nails when Craftsman bought a quarry, but, to be honest, I do it much better with my nail.  Or a hammer if you want.  It seems to me that when I use a stone, I too often hit myself on the fingers, while the other hand hurts a lot, because the stone is too heavy. <br><br>  <b>Interviewer:</b> But other companies use stones.  You want to say that the stones do not work? <br>  <b>Carpenter:</b> No, I'm not really saying that the stones do not work.  I just think that nail guns work better. <br><br>  <b>Interviewer:</b> All our architects began to use stones and they liked it. <br>  <b>Carpenter:</b> I don‚Äôt argue, but I hammer nails all day and - well, listen, I need a job, so I'm definitely ready to use stones if you want. <br><br>  <b>Interviewer:</b> Ok.  We have a few more candidates;  we will contact you when we make a decision. <br>  <b>Carpenter:</b> Well, thanks for your time.  It was nice to talk to you. <br><br>  <i>THE NEXT DAY</i> <br><br>  <i>The call ...</i> <br><br>  <b>Interviewer:</b> Hello? <br>  <b>Carpenter:</b> Hello!  Remember me?  I am the carpenter you interviewed for a black walnut tree.  I just wanted to know if you made the decision. <br><br>  <b>Interviewer:</b> Actually accepted.  In general, we like your experience, but we decided to take someone who worked more with brown. <br>  <b>Carpenter:</b> Really?  And it's all?  I wasn‚Äôt taken to work because I don‚Äôt have enough experience with brown? <br><br>  <b>Interviewer:</b> Well, this is only half true.  Partly, we took the other guy, because he is a lot cheaper. <br>  <b>Carpenter:</b> Really?  And how much experience does he have? <br><br>  <b>Interviewer:</b> Well, he‚Äôs not exactly a carpenter, he‚Äôs a car salesman.  However, he sold a lot of brown cars and worked with walnut trim. <br>  <b>Carpenter:</b> <i>[short beeps]</i> <br><br>  <i>From the translator: a very free translation that does not claim to be accurate.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/285570/">https://habr.com/ru/post/285570/</a></p>
