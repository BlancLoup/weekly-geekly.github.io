      <b>Business program</b> , which includes reports from leading domestic and foreign industry experts. <br>  <b>Round tables</b> , giving the opportunity in the company of professional colleagues to discuss the complex and sometimes delicate moments of information security. <br>  <b>Master classes</b> conducted by expert practitioners, giving the opportunity to gain practical experience in solving complex problems of information protection, such as finding vulnerabilities, analyzing the effects of hacking, analyzing tools for carrying out attacks. <br>  <b>Hacking contests</b> , in which everyone will have the opportunity to try their hand at hacking iPhone, mobile phones, browsers and protection. <br>  <b>PHD CTF 2011</b> competition is an open information security team competition held according to the rules of Capture The Flag, in which teams will defend their networks and attack their opponents networks for 8 hours. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Positive Hack Days CTF is an international competition for information security. <br>  Competitions are held on the principles of the game in CTF (capture the flag).  The essence of the competition is that several teams (10-12) defend their networks for 8 hours and attack the networks of opponents.  The main task of the participants is to find and eliminate vulnerabilities in themselves, as well as with their help, to gain access to secret information (flags) of opponents. <br><br>  The key difference PHD CTF from similar competitions - the conditions as close as possible to the real.  All prepared vulnerabilities are not invented, but are found in modern information systems.  Thus, CTF participants will have a unique opportunity to try their hand in real situations and develop their own solutions aimed at protecting information resources. <br><br>  To give an additional flavor to the competition, the PHD CTF organizers prepare the game infrastructure and make all the changes in one storyline (legend).  Such conditions create a special atmosphere and highlight Positive Hack Days CTF compared to other similar competitions. <br><br>  <b>The working version of the PHD CTF 2011 Legend:</b> <br><br>  On May 19, 2019, an international interplanetary expedition under the command of Dave Ive-tei sent on a PHD (Perfect Hyperorbital Device) spacecraft to conquer Jupiter's satellite - Europe discovered a mysterious monolith in the vicinity of Jupiter. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/316/2ec/429/3162ec4295feb40f7c3e8bb70b9c8e13.png" alt="image"></div><br><br>  The monolith, which is a huge parallelepiped, was called PHD (Parallelepiped Habile Deflective).  Everything pointed to the artificial origin of the monolith, from location and gigantic dimensions, to the ability to absorb electromagnetic radiation of any nature, frequency and intensity. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d9e/ea0/1ad/d9eea01ad34fc698d81f0a79fa56122e.png" alt="image"></div><br><br>  When trying to physically research a PHD object using a remote-controlled phd (planetary hyperflexible drone) machine, under the control of pilot Sergo Gordy, an incredible thing happened.  Copies of the monolith suddenly appeared in all the leading states of the world. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/46b/394/24b/46b39424bfc0e0b2ae74749b46831e43.png" alt="image"></div><br><br>  The widespread appearance of giant objects at first caused panic among earthlings, but gradually people became accustomed to the appearance of colossi. <br>  Everything turned the startling discovery of Professor Animimis, who demonstrated that the PHD monolith is a huge distributed transformer that accumulates the energy of cosmic radiation and transmits it to its earthly copies. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e9a/e6f/b88/e9ae6fb88bda70a61a16d88a5521976f.png" alt="image"></div><br><br>  Received experimental confirmation of the incredible fact that the earth projections use the monolith of the Internet to exchange information among themselves. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fc1/c0a/0cc/fc1c0a0cc72c763d42a0700c844f8473.png" alt="image"></div><br><br>  In the course of developing the ideas of Animimis, Dr. Pavlov came to the conclusion that monoliths are developing and, over time, the energy they generate can more than meet all the needs of humanity for hundreds of years ahead.  However, various factors may influence the growth rate of each of the projections. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b23/7fa/79c/b237fa79c45552f5641d4e2c3cd93b0e.png" alt="image"></div><br><br>  In the most negative way, network attacks affect network monoliths, which was discovered during the epidemic of the networm.PHD.32.blackout network worm.  Network malware, commonly known as shishvamtoka, attacked the monoliths and caused massive power outages.  The name given to the media by the string found in the worm‚Äôs code generated massive speculation about its Chinese origin. <br><br>  Another landmark discovery belongs to the US military.  During the preparation of the operation to establish democracy in one of the European countries, which unexpectedly discovered oil reserves. <br>  It turned out that all the tools of democratization, including the most liberal and humane cluster bombs and depleted uranium warheads, turned into useless discs.  The fuses do not explode, the missiles do not fly.  Intelligence reports that all countries in the world are experiencing similar problems. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/461/e14/289/461e142898df65b0d6764d88b02d3ace.png" alt="image"></div><br><br>  In this regard, the initial plan for the destruction of monoliths over the territory of the United States had to be urgently canceled. <br>  Remembering the impact of network attacks on monoliths, the military of the whole world conducted a mass mobilization of all the hackers in the country and instructed them to destroy the PHD monoliths of the enemy countries. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/715/ee9/ca3/715ee9ca3d234df610fd18bebe8c655e.png" alt="image"></div><br><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/W5fM6WpC_nE">And under the peaceful buzz of fans and hard drives on Earth, cyber wars began (Cyber ‚Äã‚ÄãWars)</a> . <br><br>  <b>Legend</b> <br><br>  Your elite cyber arm unit has been ordered by the commander in chief to ensure the safety of the PHD monolith and its associated information infrastructure.  Protection is complicated by the fact that in no case should block the exchange of information between monoliths.  This leads to a decrease in the growth rate of PHD and a sharp drop in power. <br><br>  In the order number 1337 ("Operation Haxor", stamp "top secret") in the tasks of the unit is charged with all available means to stop or significantly slow down the development of the monoliths of the rival countries.  The order allows the use of all available means, including those that violate the UN Khabarovsk Convention "On the prohibition of cybernetic weapons." <br>  For the duration of the operation, the unit commander is given the extraordinary military rank of captain of the communications troops. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/117058/">https://habr.com/ru/post/117058/</a></p>
