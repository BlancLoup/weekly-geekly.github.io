Working in a small company, I performed very diverse tasks, but when I looked for work as a systems analyst in the capital, I realized that the requirements for the same profession are, in fact, very different.  The larger the company and the project, the smaller the number of tasks it will have to perform, and as a result, the narrower the specialization will be.  A wide profile is possible only on small projects where there is enough resources of one system analyst. <br><br>  Here is what its duties (in general) include in redundant form: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Systems Analyst.</b>  Actually, there is no single definition as such.  However, the systems analyst is mainly engaged in analyzing the data and deciding how the system will work, what methods will be used (the key difference of the work depends on the service sector: b-2-c, b-2-b and b -2-g), as well as writing the basic technical documents (for example, according to GOST 19, 34 or Microscope 5 for Western Customers).  An important part of the work is a functional analysis, which results in highlighting the list of functions that the system must perform (for example, based on IDEF0), as well as determining system requirements.

      <b>Architect</b>  Splits the designed system into modules, thinks out the class diagram, the connections between the modules and so on. <br><br>  <b>Integrator</b> .  He is engaged in the development of integrated solutions for the automation of technological and business processes of the enterprise, while implementing the system, he works out the data that ‚Äúcirculates‚Äù between various subsystems, including at the interfaces of the implemented system and the existing one. <br><br>  <b>Business analyst</b> .  The main function - the analysis of business processes, the survey of the subject area.  At the exit - the processes of "large strokes," business process diagrams (UML, BPMN, etc.). <br><br>  <b>Designer UI</b> .  The design of the interface is from the point of view of usability with a focus on the target audience.  The product of the designer is the construction of layouts of the system being created taking into account its ease of use (roughly speaking, this is the transformation of the functions described in the TOR into toolbars, buttons, fields, tables, etc., which the end user <i>sees</i> and <i>interacts</i> with), as well as the specifications - A document giving comments to all screens in general and to each element in particular, with a complete transition map. <br><br>  <b>UX Designer</b> .  UX is a user experience.  Basically, these designers are involved in web projects (as a rule, when creating websites).  The basic concept is defined - colors, clarity, simplicity of perception, in general, everything that will allow the user to easily use the product. <br><br>  <b>Designer</b> .  As a rule, the system analyst is very rarely engaged in design, but this also happens.  The designer consistently works through all the elements of the system‚Äôs layouts, determining the shape, colors, and size of the elements.  If you need to select a group of controls, you can decide on a method: group them more tightly, highlight them in color, add animation, or use any other suitable option. <br><br>  <b>Copywriter</b>  Filling text forms produced by a copywriter, usually at the stage of preparing the product for marketing.  This text, slogans, key phrases, which also fill the pages of the system. <br><br>  The structure of personnel in IT companies, as a rule, is divisional-matrix.  That is, there is an analytical department, there is its head, but the system analyst is subordinate to the project manager.  At the same time, he can participate in several projects and submit not to his line manager, but to several managers. <br><br>  Let me remind you of the main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe post - in different companies the range of duties can vary greatly.  These or other functions can be performed by different specialists, and therefore there is no universal definition of a system analyst.  The main thing that you have to do exactly is to analyze the data and try to find the most efficient way to accomplish your task.  In any case, my personal opinion is that this work is always very interesting and diverse.  Often it is necessary to act in completely unknown areas, study them, improve and produce a product that many people will later use. <br><br>  Career prospects can also be practically any - both rising to a senior, leading systems analyst, and then head of the department, and to the field of management - from good analysts, as a rule, good project managers are obtained. <br><br>  Perhaps someone has a different opinion, I will be happy to discuss this in the comments (in which sometimes there is also a lot of useful information) <br><br>  Future system analytics, dare!  Successes! <br><habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/202762/">https://habr.com/ru/post/202762/</a></p>
