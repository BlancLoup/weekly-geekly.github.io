Their overall condition is measured at 3.5 trillion dollars.  This is more than the gross domestic product of Germany - the third largest economy in the world.

Rockefeller was young, he said that he had two dreams - to earn 100 thousand dollars and live to be 100 years old.  He died, not having lived 2 months before his 98th birthday.  But the first task Rockefeller coped with a bang. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  John Rockefeller was born in a poor family.  His father, William Avery Rockefeller, known by his nickname "Big Bill" was a helpless man who spent most of his time thinking about how to avoid hard work.  His mother, Eliza, a representative of the Baptist church, from her childhood instilled in her son faith in God and a desire to work hard. <br><br>  Rockefeller began as a simple accountant, then held his small wholesale business, and came to the founder of the largest oil company in the world - Standard Oil.  His company went down in history as the largest monopoly in US history.  Standard Oil owned 90% of the refined oil (kerosene) market in America. <br><br>  In 1911, thanks to the anti-monopoly law of Sherman, Standard Oil was divided into 34 independent companies, the controlling stake in each of which went to Rockefeller.  The division of Standard Oil doubled John Rockefeller‚Äôs personal capital. <br><br>  Since his first job, Rockefeller has always donated 10% of his income to the church.  In addition, he was actively involved in charitable activities, and remained in history as one of the largest philanthropists.  The John the Rockefeller Charity Foundation is still doing good deeds. <br><br>  <strong>Andrew Carnegie</strong> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/463/af5/ee7/463af5ee7fac408f5dea59890e0a54d1.jpg" width="240" height="278"><br><br>  <strong>The state at the peak:</strong> $ 298.3 billion.  <strong>Age at this time:</strong> 68 <br><br>  Andrew Carnegie emigrated to Pittsburgh (USA) from Scotland when he was still a child.  Already at the age of 13 he began working in a textile factory.  Andrew worked 12 hours 6 days a week, receiving only $ 2 in 6 days.  By the age of 16, Carnegie was a telegraph operator. <br><br>  Later, Andrew became a personal assistant to Thomas Scott, the superintendent of the Pennsylvania Railway Company.  There he learned a lot about the railway business.  Scott turned out to be a good mentor, and Carnegie a great student. <br><br>  When Andrew turned 20, he laid down his mother‚Äôs house and made his first investment.  Carnegie has invested $ 500 in the company Adam Express - FedEx 19 century.  After some time, he invested in a number of other companies, most of which were associated with the railway business.  By the age of 30, his stock portfolio had expanded.  Now there were also oil companies.  In addition, he actively invested in companies engaged in shipping. <br><br>  But real money came to Andrew from the production of steel.  In the 1880s, he built the largest steelmaking company involved in railway rails and some other less significant areas for Carnegie.  In 1901, at the age of 66, Carnegie retired, selling his share to John Pierpont Morgan for $ 225 million. <br><br>  However, Andrew Carnegie was known to society not only as a big businessman, but also as one of the main philanthropists of the time.  In 1989, he wrote the famous essay "The Gospel of Wealth", in which he argued that wealth should be distributed in order to improve the well-being of other people, thereby enriching the whole of society.  Andrew Carnegie was true to his words and spent about 90% of his fortune on charity. <br><br>  <strong>Nikolai II</strong> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9f0/54f/452/9f054f452318f0dac6bffcb522df7089.jpg" width="300" height="248"><br><br>  <strong>The state of the peak:</strong> $ 235 billion.  <strong>Age at peak:</strong> 49 <br><br>  Nicholas II (Nikolai Alexandrovich Romanov) - the last Russian tsar.  He ruled the Empire from 1894 to the revolution of 1917, perfected by the Bolsheviks.  His rule was remembered by the world, above all, by the growth of anti-Semitic sentiments in Russia, the defeat in the Russian-Japanese war, the revolution, and the illness of his son, which only the mysterious Rasputin could treat. <br><br>  The life of the last Russian tsar is surrounded by many secrets, legends, myths and omissions.  At the same time, it is interesting that Nicholas‚Äôs special merit is that he took the third place in the ranking of the richest people. There is no history.  He inherited his entire fortune. <br><br>  <strong>William Henry Vanderbilt</strong> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9d7/095/3da/9d70953da1b51f8ab6eba83dd252a2a2.jpg" width="150" height="180"><br><br>  <strong>The state at the peak:</strong> $ 231.6 billion <strong>Age at the peak:</strong> 64 <br><br>  William Henry Vanderbilt is really lucky.  He, like Donald Trump, started his business not from scratch.  Inherited from his father - Cornelius "Commander" Vanderbilt he got $ 100 million.  Since childhood, Cornelius has been preparing his son for the fact that he will have to inherit his father's business.  At the same time, Cornelius was a rather strict father, sometimes he even called his son ‚Äúa good-for-nothing moron‚Äù.  Of course, William was not such and was able to expand his father's empire.  Eventually, mutual understanding developed between father and son, and Cornelius became proud of what William had achieved. <br><br>  In 1885, when William died, he was the richest man in the world. <br><br>  <strong>Osman Ali Khan, Asaf Jah VII</strong> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cf1/a2e/b18/cf1a2eb18285aabd40a253a5a896f6eb.jpg" width="150" height="241"><br><br>  <strong>The state at the peak:</strong> $ 210.8 billion <strong>Age at the peak:</strong> 50 <br><br>  Asaf Jah VII was the last ruler of the Kingdom of Hyderabad and Berar, before it was conquered by India.  According to most contemporaries, His Majesty was a benevolent ruler who was seriously engaged in promoting education to the masses, science and construction.  He made primary education compulsory for all citizens.  In addition, by his decree it was free for poor people. <br><br>  When Azaf Jha was 37 years old, he brought railroad and electricity to his principality.  Azaf was a real supporter of progress.  In 1937, Azaf Jha appeared on the cover of Time Magazine as the richest man in the world. <br><br>  <strong>Andrew Mellon</strong> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/90e/7d2/735/90e7d273508e10f0132b1ec418815518.jpg" width="250" height="284"><br><br>  <strong>Peak status:</strong> $ 188.8 billion <strong>Age at peak:</strong> 80 <br><br>  Andrew Mellon is the son of the famous Pittsburgh banker Thomas Mellon (who founded Mellon Bank).  At 17, Andrew had already started working, having opened his first wood processing business.  After 10 years, he headed the bank of his father.  In addition, he was a shareholder of companies associated with oil, steel and the construction of ships. <br><br>  In 1921, US President Warren Harding appointed Mellon Minister of Finance.  Andrew was in this position with three US presidents.  In addition, during this time he was able to reduce the tax rate, reduce federal spending, thereby increasing federal income. <br><br>  <strong>Henry Ford</strong> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0b7/b27/a7f/0b7b27a7f676cffd9b02050b321745b9.jpg" width="150" height="189"><br><br>  <strong>Peak status:</strong> $ 188.1 billion <strong>Age at peak:</strong> 57 <br><br>  Perhaps almost the most famous member of the list.  And in all honesty, we can say that the most famous.  Henry knows everything, because it was he who initiated the automotive industry.  His parents were farmers, but the young Ford quickly realized that he had no desire to spend his whole life working in the field.  His childhood engineering.  In 1979, he left the house, and went to the factory as a mechanic.  He was only 16 years old. <br><br>  At the age of 28, Henry Ford joins the Thomas Edison company, where he conducts his first engine experiments.  When Henry was 36 years old, he opened his first car company, which was named "Detroit Automobile Company".  Two years after the foundation, she went bankrupt.  Then, along with his partner Leland Ford opens the company Henry Ford Company.  Soon the partners quarreled, and Ford left the case.  Leland without thinking twice renamed the company Cadillac.  The third company of Henry Ford was waiting for success.  In many ways, he was helped by the investments of the Dodge brothers. <br><br>  Well, then you yourself know everything.  Henry Ford entered the history of the automotive industry, as a man who introduced a conveyor belt into mass production.  Well, Ford T cars have become legendary, giving impetus to the entire industry. <br><br>  <strong>Marcus Licinius Crassus</strong> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7a8/406/f29/7a8406f29473d67a8cdfe0f0d5de1d98.jpg" width="150" height="164"><br><br>  <strong>Peak status:</strong> $ 169.8 billion <strong>Age at peak:</strong> 62 <br><br>  Marcus Licinius Crassus (circa 115-53 BC) was a Roman general and politician who suppressed a slave uprising led by Spartak.  He is the earliest historical figure in the list. <br><br>  Crassus made his fortune largely due to the fact that he bought houses of "enemies of Rome" (something like "enemies of the people" in the USSR) at a low cost, developed the slave trade, and the mining industry for the extraction of silver.  He was not a businessman, in the usual sense, and he tried wherever he could to use his power.  Benefit power and influence he had. <br><br>  However, the place of business was here.  At that time, real fires often broke out in Rome.  In this case, Crassus had a detachment of highly skilled builders.  During these disasters, Markus bought up burning houses and adjacent to them.  Naturally, on the cheap.  As soon as the deal was completed, the builders broke the burning house so that it would not cause much damage to the whole.  Thus, Marcus Licinius Crassus bought real estate in Rome. <br><br>  <strong>Basile II</strong> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7d6/6ed/09a/7d66ed09a8ebfeb5dee431345da6baa2.jpg" width="150" height="149"><br><br>  <strong>The state at the peak:</strong> $ 169.4 billion <strong>Age at the peak:</strong> 67 <br><br>  Basil II was a Byzantine emperor from the dynasty of Alexander the Great.  He ruled from 976 to 1025 years.  During the reign of Basil, Byzantium annexed Bulgaria and managed to expand its territory like never before. <br><br>  It seemed that golden years were coming for the Byzantine Empire.  But, alas, Basile did not leave behind him any heirs.  And after his death, the empire collapsed in just half a century. <br><br>  <strong>Cornelius Vanderbilt</strong> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/301/103/70f/30110370fd6165852892824a1a59b1b1.jpg" width="250" height="222"><br><br>  <strong>Peak status:</strong> $ 167.4 billion <strong>Age at peak:</strong> 82 <br><br>  We have already talked about the son of Cornelius.  And here is the father.  Cornelius dropped out of school at the age of 11.  Later, he will remember: "If I received an education, then I would not have time to learn everything else."  The essence of this phrase, I think, is clear.  Vanderbilt began his career as a ferryman in New York.  At 16, he borrowed money from his mother to take care of the transportation in person.  Soon the business went uphill, and Vanderbilt got the nickname of Commander, which stuck with him for life. <br><br>  Cornelius Vanderbil remember as a tough enough businessman who was merciless to competitors.  It was one of the traits of his character, which led the older Vanderbilt to success.  Well, then you already know that his son only increased the marital status. <br><br>  Afterword: It is worth noting that the article is not about absolute amounts.  The whole state is measured relative to the GDP of the country where these people lived. <br><br>  Taken <a href="http://blog.shopos.ru/%3Fp%3D28">here</a> . <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/29081/">https://habr.com/ru/post/29081/</a></p>
