  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why am I doing the last two projects with freelancers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This is the topic of Evil. <br>  This is the topic of hatred for the CIS-shnoy education system. <br>  This topic is written because I want to write it to myself as a souvenir. <br>  This topic is hate in programmers.  Welcome under the cut to those who have not yet put a minus. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I have led people since I was 18 years old.  At 17, I was the admin, at 18 ‚Äî the head of the IT department, led a social network project successfully sold (6 subordinates), video service (4 subordinates), a scraper of stores to ~ 30 countries (4 subordinates), now I lead 2 technicians and 2 programmers in <a href="http://altnetwork.ru/">altnet</a> , the rest are <i>freelancing</i> - and I hate that word. <br><br>  I also hate our ‚Äúacademic‚Äù education.  I spoke with the first course - everyone wants to be a project manager.  Students ponder knowledge of statistics, turn up their nose from PHP, but are unable to process GPS data in Java, waving that this is a routine job.  Yesterday‚Äôs graduates, with rare exceptions, do not know how to encode - they know how to use paradigms, where you need to take a standard library and write an interface.  Why standard?  Because it was necessary to experiment in college, and now you are an employee and your brick may fall on your head. <br><br>  I hate the CIS-shnoe attitude towards IT people.  ‚ÄúOh, what a clever computer is picking on computers,‚Äù say moms and grow up self-confident boys.  Girls - all the more.  Self-confident IT managers charge 5-6 projects for themselves, and disconnect phones.  From the video about everyday life of an ASP programmer hanging some time ago on Habr√©, I didn‚Äôt laugh, I wanted to cry.

      Speaking of girls.  I am afraid of girls - IT girls like fire.  Damn elitism profession multiplied by the meager number of women in the industry brings them to blatant self-confidence and ChSV.  One recently asked me for root access to the hosting server for 237 clients, being firmly confident that it would be given it under the wording ‚Äúyour nginx is crookedly configured‚Äù. <br><br>  And by the way, about the phones.  For several years I got used to the fact that the progars are falling off and throwing, but only two of all this time they called and said, ‚ÄúRumor, I threw you, find another.‚Äù  Usually the presentation is at 12 or 11, you are calling to a disconnected phone and thinking what to do.  Well I will not go home with the bat to communicate, although I want to at times.  The reasons are higher - the thought ‚ÄúI am the best‚Äù + education. <br><br>  I do not in any way detract from 100% of freelancers who value their time and actually take projects not to ‚Äúafter work‚Äù, but here and now, and make on time.  The problem is that I've met these two so far. <br><br>  In the end, I have a team of two specialists under 30 without higher education who just do their job, as indicated - in the language in which it is indicated, with frameworks and without "but I think ...".  In addition, we have 8 people who chop off the phones, disappear and mow with the terms and conditions, because they have ‚Äúzaparki‚Äù at work, but they don‚Äôt want to switch to permanent position because I am against freelancing with contract soldiers.  Alas, they do not understand that the money will be the same. <br><br>  As a result, I realized that I was bringing 2-3 projects to the end and was only doing our data center.  I was fed up with the carelessness of a Russian-speaking programmer who was lazy, confused and hung with projects that he would never complete, because he was at work, and rushed because he had a box of beer from the same Russian administrator and opened a fishconet. <br><br>  Zadolbalo. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/98199/">https://habr.com/ru/post/98199/</a></p>
