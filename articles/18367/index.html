Just do it.  Replaced the adapter, changed the battery - did not help.  He made an "acrobatic" reset, reset to factory settings - zero emotion. <br><br>  He gave up and took it to the workshop, to the craftsmen.  The craftsmen rewrote the plug with an important look, but achieved nothing.  I really felt very sad, but there was still hope.  I turned to a friend who ate a dog on mobile phones. <br><br>  The good news is that we managed to make an accurate diagnosis - the stabilizer has flown on the motherboard, which is responsible for charging. <br>  The bad news is there are no such stabilizers now, waiting for a container with parts from China.

      In short, as long as the point is true, I realized that in the near future I would not see my N70, and I took an inexpensive <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/nokia/22389.html">Nokia 6120 Classic</a> smartphone.  In the workshop, the parts did not wait, I took it and gave it to another, for greater loyalty.  From there he was returned to me with the words ‚Äúyou have repaired it so much that now nothing will help him‚Äù. <br><br>  In short, mentally, I already said goodbye to the N70, and I started using the 6120 Classic.  But at some point, stumbling upon it once again in the drawer, I decided to try it once more and turned it over to the first cellular repair office. <br><br>  A month has passed, silence.  I call them knowing in advance that they will tell me, and suddenly, lo and behold, they tell me that the mobile is healthy and waiting for the owner!  Having incredulously checked everything, I took the long-suffering N70 out of repair and wondered what I should do with it now. <br><br>  At the time of the breakdown, I had it for at least a year, and even half a year was under repair.  And I decided to try on it the new Nokia Software Updater program. <br><br>  Naturally, the firmware of the mobile phone during the time of ordeal changed two digits, from 3.xxx to 5.xxx.  The program obligingly offered to update the firmware, and after thinking for a few minutes I agreed. <br><br>  I will not say that it was easy for me to agree to this step, since for me the flashing of the phone was always associated with mysterious programs, service cables crammed anywhere, a mysterious atmosphere ... <br><br>  But the decision was made, and the program boldly began to download the latest version of the firmware.  It remained to wait about 20Mb ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/18367/">https://habr.com/ru/post/18367/</a></p>
