  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Organization of electronics and robotics group in Moscow</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I would like to tell you about my experience in organizing an electronics group at an ordinary Moscow secondary school.  It may not be very relevant to the subject of Habr, but firstly posts about education (higher, additional, abroad, interactive, etc.) appear here quite often, and therefore are interesting to many.  And, secondly, today's students who are fond of IT, electronics and robotics are, in fact, tomorrow's audience, Habra, aren't they? <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/392/b39/b92/392b39b927c937be5432990911687534.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h5>  Motives </h5><br>  This is how circumstances came about (c), that about 1.5 years ago I had a lot of free time, and I would like to use it somehow.  I thought that I should do self-development: I long ago wanted to finally learn FPGA, for example, to get some kind of certificate, or to implement some of my small embed projects (I signed up for MIT 6.002x on edx.org and even in December I successfully completed it).  But for quite a long time already in my head I thought that all this is in fact devoid of any global meaning and the final goal is unclear.  Except, of course, salary and pleasure from the process itself.  Have you ever thought about it?  What will happen after you develop and write some cool game engine, or another site for a major customer, even if it is very fast and convenient, or you program another controller on some production assembled on the last fastest MCU with a bunch periphery and kilometers of wires?  What will remain in many years from all this in the bottom line?  In general, after all this unhappy philosophy, I thought that there must be something besides this, and we need to do something else.  I remembered that I had a radio circle at school.  It existed for only a short time, and there was no system in the classes.  Then the teacher himself did not know what could be taught us.  However, I still liked to go there, in electronics there was some kind of inexplicable attraction, mystery and real magic!  It turns out that the radio circle is long gone, there are no school articles preserved, and there are still positive emotions.  In general, I decided to try to independently organize something similar.  For the guys it will be interesting and (I hope) useful, for me - a completely new experience, which is also useful.  In addition, when you try to explain something to others, you yourself begin to understand what is being said. <br><br><h5>  Last year's story, or the first pancake </h5><br>  Last summer, I began to think about where I could organize all this.  There were only 3 options: on the basis of some educational institution;  in the orphanage of creativity (such, oddly enough, still exist in Moscow and feel great);  self-shoot suitable premises.  The last option, of course, is highly undesirable, because besides the rental fee itself, it will be necessary to issue some incredible amount of papers, certificates and permits from all inspection bodies: firefighters, sanitary and epidemiologic supervision, public utilities, someone else will attach ... Yes, and money for rent there is still no (classes definitely should be free), not to mention the money for help.  The option with the house of creativity was not the best either.  The closest to me (on Ryazansky Avenue, near the shopping center "City") was still too far to be able to get there quickly after work, and from the subway is not close.  Although I still went there, I did not find anyone from the administration (in the summer, of course, there was no one there).  Educational institutions remain: they usually have everything in order with the premises, with the inspection bodies and with, in fact, the presence of children.

      He opened the map and began to look at what was around my work and at home.  Relatively close to work, I found an orphanage (by the way, I was surprised at how many orphanages for mentally retarded children, as well as correctional ones).  I chose an orphanage, not a school, because then it seemed to me that they, in theory, should be helped as far as possible.  I went to their site, found the mail and sent an e-mail with a proposal to conduct classes.  A few days passed, and in response nothing at all.  Ok, maybe people don‚Äôt have time for it, or maybe there‚Äôs just no one to read the e-mail.  After work, I called, but it turned out to communicate only with a security guard, the administration at work does not linger.  A few days later, before work, I went there myself.  This time there was not even a guard at the post, and, having walked along the first floor, I waited 10 minutes for him. When he nevertheless appeared and called the deputy for study, I went up to the second floor and waited again in the corridor.  Another 20 minutes, the guys just returned from school, everyone goes back and forth, but no one comes to me.  Half an hour later, finally met with the employee of the children.  at home, went to her office and I told who I was, who I work, what I want and what I propose to organize.  She seemed to be interested and took me to the older group.  As I understand it, there are guys from 13 to 18 years old.  Also there was their teacher.  But there were only three guys in place: one is about 13 years old, the second is about 15, and the oldest is 18 years old.  The elder was invited to specially listen to me, he himself did not want to.  And the average without stopping playing on the computer in FIFA.  I sat down and, in 15-20 minutes, told briefly about what classes I propose to organize: about crawling and flying robots, programming, microcontrollers, participation in competitions, making gifts for the New Year and birthdays, about drawing printed circuit boards, soldering irons, Arduino and so on.  Naturally, all this is in such a way that the unprepared at least understand something: on the example of cell phones, cars, TV, Christmas lights and the same computer.  It seems to me that quite a few guys who are interested in technology already at this age understand what they are talking about, although very remotely.  I was pretty sure that such classes would interest them. <br>  However, nothing of the sort!  The guy, who was 15, was distracted from the computer and asked if I could teach them to trade on the Forex online exchange.  He said that he already had some money on the account and it would be great to multiply them.  To this I replied that radio is not an economy, and in general such exchanges only lure money, and in order to earn money you need to know economics, mathematics, statistics, but in any case this is not what you are supposed to do.  But we can learn how to program, and programming can help him in this area too!  But the guy just upset and returned to FIFA.  I decided to talk to the eldest about his studies.  I learned that he was studying at a railroad college and that all these blinkers and whistles were just like his lantern.  Maybe I think they just in college, and without that full of all electronics with TAU teach?  Maybe automation, or communication, or telemetry - there is a lot of such on the railway.  Nothing of the kind - he just learns to be a machinist!  (may the machinists forgive me for such a tone) Well, I began to tell how interesting it was to develop something for the same train, deal with some kind of control system, dig around with communications, etc.  And in general on the railway a huge scope for automation!  But no, the guy said that, in general, everything he needs is able and does not see any special advantages for himself in his studies.  I, frankly, was slightly not ready for such a turn.  I still said that I would call in a couple of days and, if the guys decide to try, then we will organize a group.  I already had to run to work (almost lunch), I said goodbye and left.  Two days later, the teacher called and said: ‚ÄúYou understand, our guys are spoiled with all kinds of circles.  It seems that by the evening they had already forgotten that you came.  In addition, the eldest is now going to marry and he is not up to you.  Let us come and try again to talk, but with other children? ‚Äù <br><br>  The conclusions are as follows: <br>  1. One gets the impression that no one, except myself, is generally needed for nothing.  Neither the manager nor the teacher even asked for my phone number (although, of course, I left all my contacts in the first letter).  I myself left my business card at the exit.  Of course, there can be no questions for the children, yet they are children and still do not understand what is what and what they really need.  But at the age of 18, you can somehow think about your future.  Although it may well be that I was not interested in all told and could not interest them. <br>  2. The situation in the children.  the house does not seem at all that they lack money for something.  A normally renovated building, good big TVs in all rooms, many guys have better phones than me, computers, normal monitors, desks, and so on.  But it is not clear what will happen to them when they leave here at the age of 18.  In my opinion, no one thinks about how they will provide themselves after graduation. <br>  So last year, I lost all desire to continue to do this. <br><br><h5>  Attempt number two </h5><br>  As time went on, and in the winter, I again began to think about this idea.  By that time, I had already read everything I could find on the Internet, about organizing radio circles, and even found some special books from Soviet times.  I found some useful information on RadioKote, and also talked to two people who conduct similar classes (hello to Vadim and YS).  A timid attempt to find like-minded people at work did not, unfortunately, give any result, so they had to portray something in proud loneliness.  Well, okay! <br><br>  At the beginning of the summer, he finally gathered up his courage and went to school.  I have right next to the house as many as 3 schools, almost wall to wall.  In the first school, the guard was pretty much under the degree and at first did not understand at all what I wanted (probably, summer is having an effect).  Then he called someone, but after explaining the situation he almost immediately hung up and told me that they did not need me here.  And I didn‚Äôt even have time to explain to anyone what I, in fact, am proposing!  A very encouraging start, yes ... I decided to try again, since the schools are still nearby.  I went into the second.  Here the guard turned out to be quite normal, but he said that there was no school for mentally retarded children and still there was no one from the administration and the office at the school.  Well, went to the last school.  Again the guard, again I introduced myself and briefly described what I was proposing.  And here, too, there was no one, but ‚Äúthe director has just left!  Go catch up. ‚Äù  And indeed, on the steps of the stairs I caught up with the woman and introduced myself, she was the director of this school.  Again I briefly told who I was, where I came from and what I want.  She found out if I work and what my education is.  And it seems that my proposal interested her.  Finally!  We agreed that I would come in a few days for a more detailed conversation. <br><br>  I came at the appointed time and began to wait for my turn to get to the director (still, here are the final exams, after all, everyone has understandable problems, and besides, the teachers also want to solve their problems).  Finally, I was invited, and I described in more detail the proposed program of classes, the number of hours per week and the material base, as well as how many people the group will consist of.  In general, the director arranged everything, besides, there were no such circles in the school before that time (I didn‚Äôt doubt that much, of course). <br><br>  But here I was stunned by the fact that it would be necessary to formally get a job as a teacher of additional education.  As it turned out, it‚Äôs just not possible to come to school and arrange any (albeit free) classes.  To be honest, up to this point, I somehow did not think about it, although this is of course correct and logical: it is impossible to let anyone into the children.  I was completely unprepared for such a turn, but yes there is nothing to do.  The secretary began to tell what help and documents I need to collect.  I have never collected so much in my life: <br><ul><li>  make honey  a little book </li><li>  certificate of no criminal record </li><li>  Help from drug and psycho.  dispensaries </li><li>  certificate from KVD </li><li>  copy of employment record from work (I also get a part-time job) </li><li>  passport, SNILS, a copy of the diploma and TIN </li></ul><br>  Then my hands once again fell ... ‚ÄúMake out honey.  book "is not just to get it.  It means first to get a new blank book, then go through all imaginable and unthinkable doctors in your clinic, and then still listen to some lecture in the sanitary epidemiological station and deliver a hologram.  It is much easier to get a certificate from the Ministry of Internal Affairs - you just need to go to hell on the horns twice, with an interval of one month.  Certificates from the drug and mental hospital, it turns out, are given only at the place of registration.  In KVD, I have never been, too, the pleasure is very dubious.  In general, when I took directions in the office of the school to receive these certificates, I did not even suspect that I subscribe.  If there are willing, then I can write another big article about getting all these pieces of paper, because when I received them, I probably collected all the rakes that exist.  Initially I wanted to fit everything into one post, but this is a completely separate song, full of adventures and unexpected discoveries (here I really want to say something obscenely. But I will not). <br><br>  So, by the beginning of September (well, somewhere by the second week) I was able to get all the required pieces of paper.  At school, met a woman who coordinates the direction of add.  education.  She explained how the guys are enrolled in all sorts of circles, and also gave the requirements for the program of additional education.  He agreed with her the number and duration of classes.  I wrote an application for employment and signed it with the director.  Then I took all the documents to the personnel department, filled out a questionnaire for a bank card and wrote an autobiography that all teachers write (this is also a rather interesting point. You should briefly list your relatives, their occupation, as well as write about their education, place of work and their hobbies).  Even though I didn‚Äôt talk about salary with anyone at all, I still had to arrange a bank card, but now I‚Äôm not someone, but a teacher ... <br><br>  As a result, since Friday, September 13, I am a school teacher.  Then the most important thing - to dial a group for classes.  I made an announcement that I hoped to attract the guys, and put it in school in the most prominent places.  In addition, it turned out that the school is not one building, but three.  So I posted ads also there.  Plus, it was possible to agree that in one of the school buildings I would go through classes (from 6 to 10) during lessons and briefly tell the children about the circle.  Surprisingly, but for 5 days no one called me on the ad.  No student and no parent.  There was hope that they would be able to attract the guys with their announcement.  In the morning I came to school, I was given an assistant by a primary school teacher, and with her I walked around 10 classes (2 classes in parallel) with a two-minute story about electronics and robotics.  Here the effect was much stronger: it was obvious that some became interested, some even began to ask questions.  At the very next break, 5 or 6 people signed up, and the very first one was a girl!  I was a little surprised, but this is even great.  On this, my campaign to attract young technicians was over, I left for work. <br><br>  As a result, in a few days, there were 12 people on the list who wanted to study.  These are mostly sixth and seventh graders, but there are two of the ninth.  As I understand it, the interests of high school students are somewhat different.  During the recording, I was even twice called by the parents of one second-grader and one third-grader, but, in my opinion, such classes would be too early for them.  Also last week, I drafted a program that the Ministry of Education requires, and posted announcements for the first lesson at school. <br><br><h5>  Conclusion </h5><br>  At this point I would like to finish the already long post.  I don‚Äôt know yet whether it will work out of my idea or not, but how I became convinced to organize classes is quite real.  A lot of things remain beyond the framework and I have something to tell: <br><ul><li>  what is the planned training program </li><li>  what projects to implement the guys </li><li>  what's with the material base mug (all sorts of soldering irons, hoods, prototyping boards, computers, electronic designers, buying in Chinese stores, etc.) </li><li>  how was the paperwork and references </li><li>  And today was the first lesson! </li></ul><br>  So if the community is interested in something from the above, then you know what to do. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7f7/333/87c/7f733387c1c3df711f5cdc899e4b3cb8.jpg" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/195340/">https://habr.com/ru/post/195340/</a></p>
