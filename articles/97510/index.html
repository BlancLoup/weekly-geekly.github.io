But the bottom line is that what makes an EVO a great smartphone for one doesn‚Äôt necessarily matter to someone else.  In many cases (as for the author of this article, for example), there are a number of pros and cons in both platforms and devices, because of which the choice becomes very difficult, almost painful.  But we will try to sort through all the facts to help you make your choice. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Iron </h4><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/be0/94f/f6a/be094ff6a972e991bfe55eae8113a913.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><br>  Both phones are very similar, if you look at their list of characteristics, except for one significant point: EVO is huge.  Generally speaking, many can offer another phone, such as Droid Incredible, or Droid X, for a more honest comparison with the iPhone. In addition to the lack of a camera on the front side and 4G support, these phones are practically the same as EVO, only smaller in size.  But this article is not about Droids.

    <h5>  Design </h5><br>  This is purely a matter of personal preference, so we will not delay here.  The EVO is made of plastic, the iPhone is made of glass and metal, the EVO has a stand, and the iPhone is thinner (9.3 mm versus 12.7 mm).  They both fit well in a pocket, and both look great.  It is difficult to say who will win the crash test, but both devices seem to us too good to try to find out.  The weight of the EVO scares us a little.  And we have already seen several reports about broken screens.  The iPhone, on the other hand, due to the unprotected glass panels, looks fragile.  Despite the fact that he is stronger in fact, invulnerable, too, can not be called. <br><br><h5>  Screen </h5><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9d4/c3a/eb1/9d4c3aeb16395bd94ed89b5e01f98b88.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><br>  The 4.3-inch EVO screen looks amazing, while the 3.5-inch iPhone screen looks the same ... as long as you do not look: and you realize that it is also incredible.  EVO wins in size, and iPhone - in pixel density (which is close to printing), and even in resolution (960x640 vs. 800x480).  In addition, the iPhone screen is brighter and clearly better quality. <br><br>  In general, this is purely a matter of personal preference: size or quality. <br><br><h5>  Cameras </h5><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5c9/177/5be/5c91775bebdb083f0ec99cda04ad1358.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><br>  In EVO, both cameras have a higher resolution than the iPhone (8 MP / 1.3 MP versus 5 MP / VGA).  Both manufacturers use a backlight sensor.  And Apple claims that their sensor is very good for shots in low light conditions. <br><br>  Well, EVO wins according to specifications, but in practice we tend to think that the pictures and videos taken on the iPhone are better.  The video has better sound and less artifacts, plus a higher frame rate in 720p mode - 30 vs. 24 per EVO.  Photos look better too - less JPEG artifacts, less grain, less chromatic aberrations. <br><br>  <i>(Translator's note: in the original article there are several photos and videos for your own comparison. Those interested can see them <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/06/25/iphone-4-or-evo-4g-which-one-should-you-get/">in the original source</a> .)</i> <br><br><h5>  Battery </h5><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bc7/a2a/b81/bc7a2ab81a604652aa77d41233b0798e.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><br>  This is an important moment for most people.  In our experience, EVO can last one day in a light mode of use in a 3G network, and a little less in 4G.  In turn, the iPhone improved (and already pretty good in the iPhone 3GS) battery, and it objectively surpasses EVO both in standby time and in active use mode. <br><br>  On the other hand, the battery in EVO can be replaced if you agree to carry a spare one with you. <br><br>  In general, we think that most people will be able to get along with the EVO battery, but if you want comfort in terms of battery life, the iPhone is better. <br><br><h4>  Platform </h4><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/baf/b85/8c9/bafb858c931235d263c982c5d6c214c3.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><br><h5>  Alert system </h5><br>  The concept of Google's notification system is so much more pleasant, convenient and unobtrusive than Apple's pop-ups, that we are surprised how much time Apple took <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/06/09/palm-loses-webos-notifications-architect-to-apple/">to understand it</a> <i>(Translator's Note: here we are talking about news when Apple lured to itself an employee of the Palm who deals with alert systems in WebOS. Which is very good.).</i> <br><br><h5>  Keyboard </h5><br>  Both phones have only a touchscreen keyboard, and both are very good.  The advantage of EVO is in the size of the keyboard.  And we also like the system of predictions when entering HTC: for example, offering several alternative words at the same time as you type.  But the iPhone keyboard is still the best touchscreen keyboard, of all that we have ever used.  And the spell checker in iOS 4 further enhances its advantage. <br><br><h5>  Widgets </h5><br>  Android: is.  iPhone: no. <br><br><h5>  Multitasking </h5><br>  Apple has finally implemented multitasking in the new iOS 4, but, of course, did it in its own way.  In fact, Apple still does not allow full multitasking on its phone, but only some background services.  Android also allows you to keep running multiple applications at once.  However, Apple‚Äôs policy makes sense: if you don‚Äôt close Android apps on time, the phone soon begins to heat up (we say this from personal experience with EVO), slow down, and irrepressibly absorb the battery. <br><br><h5>  Perfection </h5><br>  This is quite definitely, again, a matter of taste, but in short: iPhone is for aesthetes, Android is for computer fans. <br><br>  <i>(Translator's note: in the original, ‚ÄúiPhone is for aesthetes, Android is for nerds.‚Äù; My first translation was ‚ÄúiPhone - for aesthetes, Android - for nerds,‚Äù but according to reader reviews, I found this not quite a politically correct translation, and changed. I apologize to users of the Android platform.)</i> <br><br><h5>  Applications </h5><br>  There is no denying the fact that there are more applications on the iPhone, significantly more games, and the overall level of applications is higher, thanks to a more advanced SDK and growing competition.  However, when it comes to non-gaming applications, the Android Market is also pretty good. <br><br>  On both devices there is an approval mechanism (approval) of applications before entering the store, but on Android it is less and less strict (for example, the same emulators), and besides, you can install unsigned applications directly.  On the iPhone, you must first jailbreak it. <br><br><h4>  Summary </h4><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/608/e98/60e/608e9860ed22c4ae3a350ee0e245dda0.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><br>  You have the facts, you have listened to the arguments, so now ... follow the call of your heart! <br><br>  <i>UPD:</i> <i><br></i>  <i>A detailed review of iPhone 4 on Engadget: <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/06/22/iphone-4-review/">iPhone 4 review</a></i> <i><br></i>  <i>My translation of the review of the iPhone 4 on Habr√©: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/apple/97246/">Apple iPhone 4 Review</a></i> <i><br></i>  <i>A detailed review of HTC EVO 4G on Engadget: <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/05/19/htc-evo-4g-review/">HTC EVO 4G review</a></i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/97510/">https://habr.com/ru/post/97510/</a></p>
