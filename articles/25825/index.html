      Every day, lying at the window told his neighbor about what was happening outside the window.  He saw a boat, fishermen with a huge catch, children playing on the shore, young lovers holding hands and not shining their shining eyes from each other. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  While he was watching all these amazing events outside the window, his neighbor was tormented by deaf grudge.  This is unfair, he thought.  ‚ÄúWhat kind of merit was laid at his window, not for me, and I can only see the door with peeling paint, while he admires the view from the window?‚Äù <br><br>  One day, lying by the window, he coughed and began to choke.  He tried to reach the nurse‚Äôs call button, but he didn‚Äôt have the strength because he was coughing.  The neighbor watched the scene.  He had nothing to press his button, but he did not. <br><br>  After some time, the first subsided and stretched out on his bed. <br><br>  When he was taken away, the neighbor asked the nurse to be transferred to the window.  The nurse complied with the patient's request, retired his bed, helped him to bed on the opposite bed, and making sure that the patient was comfortable, she went to the door.  Suddenly, she was stopped by a surprised exclamation of the patient: <br><br>  - How so!  This window overlooks the dead gray wall!  But the one who died told me that he had seen a forest, a lake, clouds, people ... How could he see all this from this window? <br><br>  The nurse smiled sadly. <br><br>  ‚ÄúHe could not see anything at all;  your deceased neighbor was blind. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/25825/">https://habr.com/ru/post/25825/</a></p>
