  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The best Linux programs on the HP network</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  First, a little context. <br>  In HP, workstations mostly use Windows.  However, Linux plays an important role in the HP infrastructure.  I wrote about this on the <a href="http://hport.ru/archive/2008/06/20/29670.aspx">Russian HP blog</a> .  Linux workstations are also used by themselves, but for obvious reasons, Linux users have difficulty due to the fact that many programs and portals are not very suitable for them. <br>  The author is such a user who, despite the difficulties mentioned, finds pleasure in using <b>Debian Linux</b> on his laptop. <br>  This topic a few days ago I posted on <a href="http://hport.ru/archive/2009/08/12/53048.aspx">our blog</a> , and now I‚Äôm going to add a little more to share it with habrovchanami.  By the way, this is my first post, please do not kick with your feet if something is not quite right. <br>  Using <b>Debian Etch for</b> a year and a half and then <b>Lenny</b> as an OS for a workstation, I want to share my impressions of self-justified and not entirely justified Linux applications. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Palm branch goes to <a href="http://winnehq.org/">Wine</a> developers.  Yes, it was their efforts in my eyes that the HP Service Center client for Windows fully earned from under the wine. <br>  It is thanks to this that it became possible in normal mode to use the Service Center for my work as an engineer who supports the <a href="http://www.hp.com/go/nnmi">HP Network Node Manager</a> .  In my eyes for incomplete 2 years, wine improvements have occurred along the following upward trajectory: <br>  i.  wine 0.9.x - SC is installed but not running, <br><br>  ii.  wine 1.0.x - SC starts, but searching the knowledge base and using charts leads to incorrect termination, SC drops, <br><br>  iii.  wine 1.1.x - SC runs, opens the search in the knowledge base, opens the charts correctly, finds documents, but does not open them - the problem of authentication or access to the database.

      iv.  and finally 1.1.26 ~ winehq1-1.  Everything works with a bang, a full search and use of the knowledge base!  This is a feat in my opinion.  The only small note when opening pdf documents, the choice does not appear: open or save.  That is, pdf documents can not be viewed.  But I don‚Äôt like to open them from under SC, almost always they are available from the HP OpenView <a href="http://support.openview.hp.com/">technical support portal</a> and informative value for us is rarely for engineers.  The slight curvature of the text display during fast scrolling also says goodbye generously, this does not interfere with the work. <br><br>  Total painstaking work of wine-sheep and the constant significant improvement in the functionality of this product, which made it possible to work comfortably with a complex Windows program. <br><br>  Gold medal went to <b>FireFox</b> .  No, I'm not going to ‚Äúflame‚Äù about browsers at all, especially since Opera remains my main and favorite browser on the Internet for me.  But alas, HP has nothing to do with it.  Our intranet is too ‚Äúwild‚Äù for a fragile and light Norwegian masterpiece.  <i>NTLM authentication is</i> not supported in Opera, but via intranet, where MS SharePoint is widely used, <i>NTLM is</i> needed. <br><br>  FF calmly passes here.  Further.  quite unexpectedly for me, FF went through such slaloms as HP <a href="http://rooms.hp.com/">Virtual Rooms</a> (similar to <a href="http://webex.com/">WebEx</a> for remote access to the site via standard web protocols) and <a href="http://www.vmware.com/">VMWare</a> .  That is, these programs have a plugin for FF, which are quietly ‚Äústuck‚Äù and working. <br><br><img src="http://img30.imageshack.us/img30/3475/0185ba6138e102orig.png" alt="image"><br><br>  It is stated that WebEx works from under Linux.  but I could not get it to run.  Maybe hands will reach and I will be engaged in it.  But, while not very necessary, HPVR quietly replaces it. <br><br>  The silver medal goes to <a href="http://pidgin.im/">Pidgin</a> .  He deserved this plugin <a href="http://sipe.sourceforge.net/">pidgin-sipe</a> , which allowed to communicate with an office communicator from MS (MOC - Microsoft Office Communicator) without going into Windows.  Does not support konfy mode with several participants and calls.  Konfoi is used quite rarely and nobody uses my calls.  Well, except for MOC, the entire gentlemanly set of IM protocols: ICQ, google talk, <a href="http://jabber.org/">jabber</a> , etc. <br><br>  There are disappointments for Linux users in HP: the same Opera, I hope at least <i>NTLM</i> authentication will be screwed in future versions.  A bunch of portals within the network using a variety of technologies as in the dashing 90s of browser wars and sharpened under MS (on the intranet, HP is only officially supported by IE).  The main disappointment is the lack of HP support for remote access for USB owners of a smard-card device, although it would seem a long time ago for Linux. <br><br>  UPDATE: The new plugin <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/sipe/files/sipe/pidgin-sipe-1.6.2/pidgin-sipe-1.6.2.tar.bz2/download">pidgin-sipe-1.6.2</a> supports <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/sipe/files/sipe/pidgin-sipe-1.6.2/pidgin-sipe-1.6.2.tar.bz2/download">config</a> mode. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/67700/">https://habr.com/ru/post/67700/</a></p>
