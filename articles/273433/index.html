  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Primary values ‚Äã‚Äãof the secondary market. Arguments and Facts</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Buying a server and its equipment is an important step for any organization.  In the modern world, the data is worth its weight in gold, so the strictest requirements are put forward for the reliability of this machine.  It is logical that on the manufacturer‚Äôs side, a considerable price is being put forward as a response to such requirements.  And since the best manufacturers are in the United States, this measure is calculated in dollar terms.  And the dollar, as well as technical progress, does not stand still, especially recently. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2a7/8d9/121/2a78d91218d94677842660cd1d432a4c.png"><br><br>  So it turns out that our domestic companies, representatives of small and medium-sized businesses in crisis conditions, have to wonder: how to save money and not sacrifice quality?  The answer of the official representatives of the manufacturers of the equipment is always at the ready: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs impossible to eat fish and, as they say, go on a diet.  So accept and hurry with the acquisition, while the exchange rate has not updated the next historical maximum. ‚Äù

      But who thinks and analyzes, it is clear that the answer is ambiguous, because no one has yet canceled the secondary market of IT equipment.  This is where disputes and inappropriate comparisons with used cars, expired food and other nonsense begin.  But demagogy, in contrast to the budget is inexhaustible. <br><br>  Turning to the case, we will consider the main arguments of the vendors against the acquisition of server hardware in the REFURBISHED state and analyze them from the point of view of everyday logic. <br><br><h5>  <b>Prehistory</b> </h5><br>  We contacted the largest Russian companies implementing new proprietary equipment under the pretext of acquiring a server.  Since we mostly specialize in Hewlett Packard products, we also considered the server under the HP brand.  At the same time, we gave a hint that, as a client, we are hesitating between buying the latest generation server and purchasing second-hand equipment, which has left generation production, but with a guarantee and many times lower prices.  Objections were not long in coming, and we will discuss the most popular ones. <br><br><h5>  <b>Vendor arguments and their sober analysis</b> </h5><br><h6>  1. The server of an earlier generation is limited in expansion. </h6><br>  Remarkable argument.  We will try to discuss it without going into technical details.  No one is going to challenge the superiority of the new technology over the old one.  The fact is that in any organization at a certain stage of development, the server equipment faces quite definite tasks, which mostly more than fall within the capabilities of the older server model.  Moreover, the potential, for example, of the HP Proliant DL360 G6 server, fully satisfies all modern software and hardware requirements.  With regard to small business, it is designed for a wide range of tasks and an impressive staff.  So for a company of 20-30 people, equipped with a 1C base and internal mail, the potential built above the described server is more than enough, with a reserve for a possible increase in staff. <br>  So let's move on to the following objections. <br><br><h6>  2. It is impossible to find components, since they can be, like the server itself, discontinued. </h6><br>  Here you can make one clarification: vendors no longer implement components for equipment discontinued.  So it will be more correct and more honest, since our company sells not only used servers, but also components for them.  It could not be otherwise, because a server without components is a useless chassis on the shelf.  Therefore, every customer purchasing equipment from us can be sure that it will be provided with any major components to it. <br><br>  Immediately from the above, the following logical argument follows from vendors. <br><br><h6>  3. Used components have dubious quality and there is no guarantee that they will not fail at the crucial moment. </h6><br>  Firstly, although we are working mostly on the secondary market, we have not only used ones.  You can purchase brand new equipment or branded components at an affordable price. <br><br>  Secondly, we would advise buying some second-hand parts only, since they cannot be reliable, and the price for a new product is unreasonably higher than it was once used.  For example, guide rails and slide for HDD.  By the way, the theme of the sled was so burning that it caused a flurry of discussion in an <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/westcomp/blog/265967/">article</a> about them. <br><br>  And finally, thirdly, we, like any self-respecting company, are ready to vouch for the quality of our goods by providing the client with various warranty conditions and the MoneyBack program for seven days. <br><br>  "Warranty say?"  So ...! ‚Äù- and vendors again strike back with another argument. <br><br><h6>  4. This is just a guarantee of the sales company.  But there is no guarantee of the manufacturer.  So, upon the occurrence of a warranty case, the services will be provided at least not as quickly as the manufacturer.  It threatens to idle in work. </h6><br>  It is worth clarifying here that the HP Care Pack branded warranty, the expediency of purchasing options we already discussed in the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/westcomp/blog/267641/">article</a> , promises to deal with the abnormal situation fairly quickly (by the way, we do not dispute the efficiency of HP warranty services). <br><br>  Yes, let's be frank, we cannot brag about such efficiency as in the same HP Proactive Care option.  Just let's figure it out.  The various HP Care Pack quick response options cost money, which can be applied differently.  How?  Well, first, how about acquiring a spare parts kit from additional HDD, memory bars and power supply.  Thus, by ‚Äúduplicating‚Äù the most emergency nodes, downtime can be avoided until the circumstances of the warranty are clarified.  Secondly, for the money that can be spent on a new server and a guarantee, you can buy two similar used / used servers with a disk array and create a failover cluster based on them.  This completely eliminates the possibility of downtime.  In the article about the HP Care Pack, we considered this opportunity thoroughly.  Everything is logical and without exaggeration. <br><br>  This is how we are argued for by the ‚Äúdestructiveness‚Äù of the used market.  But these are just words, to believe or not to believe in which everyone can.  We are sure that the vendors themselves understand everything perfectly, but it is their work that they successfully do.  We do our job and also successfully.  So there is nothing personal in this exchange of views - just one job.  Work For You. <br><br>  <a href="http://westcomp.ru/catalog/servery/">Buy a server</a> - the task is responsible and tricky.  And as always, our task is to help you with this. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/273433/">https://habr.com/ru/post/273433/</a></p>
