You can ask the design and installation organization to make the project, and then on it installation.  But it is uninteresting and stuck in the budget.  So consider the alarm with their own hands.  Will consider the fire alarm system (fire alarm) and access control system (ACS) in the apartment and house (cottage) <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Design </h4><br>  In the beginning it is necessary to determine the project.  The project should be, if it is a public place, to which our house does not apply.  But the sensor circuit, where and where it is connected is desirable for future service. <br><br>  Now we are determined with the tasks.  The number of sensors and wires.

    <h5>  Fire Loops </h5><br>  There are address and simple.  It is more convenient to use addressees, but the output is more expensive (usually a computer with the appropriate software is used), so we do simple. <br>  To ensure protection against false positives, we put at least two chimneys in each room, except for the bathroom and the kitchen.  There are no fire alarms in the bathroom, but flame detectors are made in the kitchen.  Each detector controls the area of ‚Äã‚Äã5-10 square meters. <br><br>  Consider a small example: if a room is 5 square meters, then there are two sensors, if 45 square meters, then there are 5 sensors evenly spaced around the room (the sensor has a range of about 3.5 meters).  It does not place a pair of parking brake (for each exit separately).  Handbrake - manual sensor, push the button and fire alarm is triggered.  This is necessary if something caught fire, and the alarm did not work, especially if you have an agreement with firefighters.  Press the button quickly, that call and call the address when you need to try to localize the fire and reduce losses. <br><br>  Sensors work around the clock. <br><br><h6>  Wires </h6><br>  The power and control of the loop goes through two wires.  For example, KSVV 2h0,5.  But I recommend to make all the same KPSEng-FRLS 1x2x0.5 or KSEVEng-FRLS 2x0.5 (well, or another similar one marked FRLS), which differ in that the second is a twisted pair. <br><br>  Cables FRLS, except for the certificate, are fire resistant.  After all, if the fire started with cables, then the fire alarm may not work or it will go into fault mode.  The cable is more expensive by 2-5 times, but they need not so much and this is done for several years (the warranty period is 5 years). <br><br>  FRLS - a mandatory requirement for firefighters. <br><br><h6>  Connection </h6><br>  Sensors are connected in series, the connection diagram is in any instruction (both to the sensors themselves, and to the receiving devices). <br><br><h5>  Security Loops </h5><br>  We provide two circuits protection (SP required).  The first is the perimeter of the house or apartment, this includes doors and windows, the second internal - motion sensors.  This is convenient if you live in a house, then you can switch on the perimeter security sensors for the night and sleep better.  It would be more correct to make loops through the rooms, so that it was clear in which room the alarm was triggered, but this way more loops are needed and this should be taken into account. <br><br><h5>  Wires </h5><br>  These sensors are considered active and they need 12V power.  Four wires are used, such as KSVV 4x0.5 and the like.  You can use UTP 2x2x0.51. <br><br><h6>  Connection </h6><br>  Sensors are connected in series. <br><br><h4>  Installation </h4><br>  Everything is simple, there should be no problems.  The main thing is to follow some rules: <br><ul><li>  Wires away from power (220V). </li><li>  Through the wall additionally in the cambric. </li><li>  The instructions for the sensors have tips on placement and connection. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Service </h4><br>  With sensors wipe pyt.  Once every 3-4 months to check the performance of security sensors, test the chimneys (they have a test button).  Check the voltage at the power and battery terminals.  Usually there are instructions on how to conduct maintenance. <br><br><h4>  Devices </h4><br>  It is better to use devices of one system, for example, a car or a line, i.e.  sensors and control panel of one company.  It is also desirable to use the same company detectors, such as DSC and TECO. <br><br>  You can open the site of the car or the line and see the typical schemes (common schemes for somewhere that connects), but we will go some other way. <br><br><h5>  Option 1 </h5><br>  We put the guard with the best traditions of American films. <br><br>  Take the company DSC At the entrance will be a keyboard (in the house - in the vestibule, garage and separately in the bath and other rooms) let's say LCD5501E.  The device itself will be PC1864 and expanders for each additional room PC5108.  IR sensors (for motion) and sound sensors are manufactured by TEKO Astra-5A (or if there are animals Astra-511 or Astra-512, depending on weight) and Astra-C, respectively. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4c2/6bd/f86/4c26bdf86ffb45fd27639e493c39e5c3.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a12/16a/b49/a1216ab499b7950e914e5fb0fe5c3ab0.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/945/3c6/2f0/9453c62f0c0a431abf67527b80e2b576.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/122/d07/45f/122d0745f67ff53254b01cdea8fcd77f.jpg"><br><br>  VERS-PK1TM will be in charge of the fire - with one loop with smoke pipes DIP-3SU (IP 212-3SU) and the hand hammer IPR-55 of the Irset-Center company.  In the house we use VERS-PK4-04 with four or VERS-PK8-02 with eight trains (for each building you need a separate train and it is advisable to split them into floors so that it is clear where to run and where to put out. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bc4/525/20d/bc452520d29ccd719bb1be38bbdb9ecd.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5d3/4e9/bf6/5d34e9bf667c5eacfa86ebd1f3c3f260.gif"><br><br>  Do not forget about the resistors (resistance) at the end of the loops and at the smokers, which are needed to monitor the integrity of the loop.  If the cable is cut or short-circuited, the device will signal a malfunction. <br><br>  It is better to place all the control panels in a metal box, for example, SchMP-2-0. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8f5/776/a03/8f5776a03b5e9b1144666f5f11d3793b.jpg"><br><br>  Alert will be engaged in the siren of the Pipe inside and outside the Thunder-12K.  The pipe is a small ‚Äúsqueaker‚Äù that will surely lift you out of bed, even if you are sleeping with your neighbors.  It is not recommended to install this in an apartment (or all neighbors should be warned) or to put it more quietly, for example, TON-1C-12 <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b62/1fc/f23/b621fcf237fe13cb92b1c02c78f0cc85.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b5f/482/9d5/b5f4829d51c178391e96994a6d94d4bb.jpg"><br><br>  You need a couple of emergency lights to make it easier to navigate at night (they turned off the electricity - they turned on).  Do not forget about the batteries in the control panel. <br><br>  Then he calls the security company and set him on guard.  Security guards and equipment will come to check the equipment and say what they need (buy a transmitter from them and a pair of relays, for example, UK / VK-02) and set the guard. <br><br>  Although it is better to call the company and ask about the equipment.  It is advisable to choose a company whose post is not far and has licenses for installation, maintenance and protection, and security certificates and technicians. <br><br><h4>  Option 2 </h4><br>  Protection on your own. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/266/18d/3ef/26618d3efdd28c3676c829c8bab23d60.png"><br>  We put Mirage-GSM-A4-03 of the firm NPO Stealth, which has 4 loops or Mirage-GSM-M8-03 with 8 loops.  We stick two SIM cards into it, set it up.  Connect the sensors from the previous version.  You can connect the siren.  In the event of an alarm, the siren will work and an SMS will be sent (or a voice robot will inform you) what worked where.  The bank agreed and gave the phone to the security organization, when they worked together, they came.  As a result, the bank director, bank security officer and security company knew that the alarm went off. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f4d/530/4cc/f4d5304ccfbb80f4ad25210a75b5b7c6.jpg"><br><br>  Fire loops work around the clock, and they are armed with an electronic key. <br><br><h4>  findings </h4><br>  It‚Äôs not hard to do it yourself from the beginning to the end.  It costs money to order a project (and it will be released as the alarm itself), the working documentation will be cheaper (circuits and connections are made).  Installation will also increase the cost of the system by almost two, and if you are not confident in your abilities and even less holding a drill and a hammer drill in your hands, then it is better not to do it yourself.  Security is a matter of responsibility, and if you work alongside you can protect your house yourself, like a real man. <br><br>  But let's face it.  If there is an acquaintance of the designer of the OPS or you will find it in the design organization with a shabka (some managers, and the designers themselves take it).  It is better to order at least working documentation, in the end you will pick up the equipment, its placement and make a list of materials.  Installation in this case is not difficult to do. <br><br>  The security is better placed.  After all, if robbed (well, anything can happen), then they have to pay damages if you set the security at the exit, but in any case you should read the contract carefully.  It says who is to blame and who will pay damages. <br><br>  Some security companies have licenses for fire suppression, it will be a big plus.  After all, after the fire alarm system has been activated, it is necessary to call yourself at 03, or to register a security company in the contract so that they can call when an alarm occurs. <br><br>  Abbreviations: <br>  OPS - fire alarm system <br>  ACS - access control system (intercom, electric locks) <br>  Sensor (in the text) - fire or security detector <br>  Smokes - this is a fire detector that reacts to smoke, but can give false positives to dust, in the bathroom and in the kitchen because of the steam can produce a drawdown. <br>  Flame detectors are a fire detector that responds to flames. <br>  Handbrake - fire detector manual or IPR, press the button and fire alarm is triggered. <br>  A receiving device (in the text) or a receiving-control device (PEP) is a device that monitors the state of the loops and issues an alarm. <br>  IR sensor - security detector volume optical-electronic, responsive to movement. <br>  The QMS, a magnetic security contact detector that responds to the magnet's distance from the reed switch, is placed on the door. <br>  Audible - a sonic security alarm detector, usually responds to glass breaking. <br><br>  PS Moderators can move to the desired section. <br>  PS2.  If you have questions or comments, I will answer. <br>  PS3.  I can make an exemplary project (documentation), if anyone needs it and provides schemes <br>  PS4.  ‚ÄúThe style of presentation is like that of a caveman‚Äù (c) slaum - if you indicate where the stylistic mistakes are and how to fix it, I will be very grateful.  Better in PM. <br><br>  Article posted <a href="http://video-and-skud.ru/%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F_%25D1%2581%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8_%25D1%2580%25D1%2583%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8">here</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/137024/">https://habr.com/ru/post/137024/</a></p>
