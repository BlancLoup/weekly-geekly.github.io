Command &amp; Conquer is considered to be a legend, the developers of many modern projects are still guided by the standards, ideas and techniques embodied in C &amp; C.  However, the third part does not just revive old traditions, but brings the series to a new level, proclaiming the beginning of the next era in the development of the real-time strategy genre. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/d20/015/62b/d2001562b93bc23d22c8ef8bfeb4772a.jpg" width="450" height="300" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br>  Earth, 2047  The period of relative peace and tranquility quickly ended, and the NOD brotherhood, led by Kane, unleashed a third Tiberium war.  On the surface of the tormented planet, the atomic explosion mushrooms grew again, but this time the coalition forces of the GDI were not ready for military action.  The last stronghold of justice and justice suffers huge losses under the blows of NOD, while the planet slowly dies in the meantime.  Only twenty percent of the so-called ‚Äúblue‚Äù, ecologically clean zones remain on Earth, where the GDI forces are concentrated.  Exactly half of the globe was covered with ‚Äúyellow‚Äù zones, where edible food and drinking water are worth their weight in gold, and power is in the hands of a group of fanatics.  The rest of the planet was covered with dense thickets of the deadly poisonous mineral Tiberius.  Terrestrial organisms do not survive in this ‚Äúred‚Äù zone, but mutants and guests from deep space feel at ease ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/8bc/f71/4fe/8bcf714fe2086686c9bb355afe3bacde.jpg" width="450" height="336" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br>  We also recall that in Command &amp; Conquer 3 many stars from popular films and TV series were shot.

      Game features: <br>  The planet is dying before your eyes!  The story of the invasion of Earth by alien invaders is revealed in three dozen episodes.  You will be able to evaluate the events from the point of view of each of the three parties: GDI, NOD and aliens alien to people. <br>  Game and movie in one box!  The exciting twists and turns of the script are served in full-screen video with live actors.  There are real Hollywood stars such as Tricia Helfer, Josh Holloway, Michael Ironside, Billy Dee Williams, Grace Park, Ivana Bozilovich and Shauntai Hinton. <br>  The enemy sees through you!  A unique artificial intelligence, created by the so-called "adaptive" technology, allows computer opponents to react logically and competently to all your steps.  However, you yourself can set an aggressive or defensive line of conduct for a virtual opponent, but even in this case, its actions will not be easy to predict. <br>  Fast, interesting, convenient!  Managing the game is easy to understand in five minutes, and rich actions will not let you be bored for a second.  Gathering resources, research and war are organically woven into a sci-fi thriller! <br>  New era - a new weapon!  Along with the long-familiar war machines, you will receive designs that meet the latest technological advances.  Among them are huge flying fortresses, a satellite network of orbital defense, as well as giant transforming mechanisms consisting of several separate combat units. <br>  Discover the image of the 21st century!  The beauty of post-apocalyptic landscapes and the entertainment of special effects surpass everything seen before.  In the past, such quality graphics could be seen only in specially reduced screensavers.  Clouds of black smoke rising above the battlefield, photorealistic flames, fiery traces of shells and destructive explosions make you believe what is happening on the screen. <br>  More than a game!  Collective battles with many different modes are aimed not only at amateurs, but also at professionals.
