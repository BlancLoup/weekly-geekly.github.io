The stories were as exciting as sad.  After the epic with analysis and collection ended, I asked Igor to tell all the methods of cheating known to him, of which there were as many as twenty pieces.  Most of them concern iPhone buyers, but some also apply to sellers, who are also trying to deceive with irrelevant regularity. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ed2/481/d45/ed2481d45a82490a9cdd573b64d4688e.jpg"><br><br>  Following the results of the post, which I hope will help you avoid many troubles when buying gadgets.  Moreover, the tricks of fraudsters are universal, and can be applied not only in operations with Apple products. <a name="habracut"></a>

      <b>Method 1. Selling iPhone prepaid.</b> <br><br>  This is the most common way to scam.  Perhaps you even read about it.  But fraudsters have recently become more cunning.  Resourceful black dealers prescribe the conditions of purchase in the ad: ‚Äúwithout prepayment‚Äù, ‚Äúself-pickup‚Äù, ‚Äúpayment after checking for operability‚Äù, ‚Äúwithout Corn cards‚Äù and even buy the ‚ÄúStore‚Äù status on Avito for 40,000 rubles a year.  The sale scheme looks reliable even for a suspicious guy, and you are calling.  On that wire, a confident competent manager talks about the pros and cons of the model you are interested in, advises on emerging issues, accepts the order, learns about the need for additional accessories (protective cover, car charger, etc.).  Everything, as in decent stores.  Then you are promised delivery within two hours, payment after a complete check of the device, and even artistic cutting of the sim card. <br><br>  After that follows a sly trick with ears.  The manager explains that due to the frequent attempts of courier robberies and payments with counterfeit money, you will have to pay for the iPhone through your personal account replenishment, and a check with a protection code, without which they will not be able to withdraw your money, must be delivered to the courier.  When you come to the terminal Qiwi, "Eleksnet" or any other, you call up the manager, and he explains to you that you need to go into one of the wallets and enter your contract number. <br><br>  ‚ÄúSo, ready?  Enter!  Nine zero three five five one one two one seven ‚Äù(9035511217, i.e. regular phone number),‚Äú now make the full amount of the payment ‚Äù.  What happens next - guess yourself.  Also, in addition to terminals, fraudsters famously use Euroset with its Corn, Svyaznoy, and even Sberbank cards, making out cards on dummy persons. <br><br>  ‚ÄúAnd what about shipment at own expense?‚Äù, - you ask.  Yes, everything is fine!  ‚ÄúThe office is closed for repairs in the next 3 days,‚Äù or, alternatively, ‚ÄúLocated at Mikhnevo, Gogol street, 17, directly opposite Sberbank‚Äù or ‚ÄúWe have very long queues, stand 2-4 hours.‚Äù  After that, you will be offered a scheme with a courier - and then according to the described recipe. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/966/52e/267/96652e267e2742edbbe2c34abbf9aecc.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5d9/b94/7e4/5d9b947e41bf45dab69cdfeb0ce1bdad.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Method 2. A large online store sells iPhones with a big discount on prepayment.</b> <br><br>  Unfortunately, even well-known stores that have proven themselves over the years use prepayments for mercenary purposes.  It happens like this.  A 50% retracement is announced, but with 100% prepayment and delivery in three weeks.  The fame of the store and the low price for the device pushes people to line up to give their money.  There is a transfer of funds in the office, you are given a full package of documents - checks, contract, everything is grand and noble. <br><br>  When you call three weeks later to clarify whether you can pick up your telephone, they explain to you that due to the very high number of completed orders, the company does not cope with the delivery of such volumes, does not fit on time and carries your order for another 2-3 weeks.  This is allowed by the terms of the contract, which you most likely did not read very carefully.  After 2-3 weeks, the story repeats, but the cause of the delay may change.  Theoretically, you can start the money-back procedure, but you are told that the iPhone is close, and you have to wait quite a bit.  Well, right here a drop.  Some give in to persuasion, others do not.  The story continues until the buyer has run out of patience.  But even if he immediately goes to draw up a waiver, he learns that under the terms of the contract (who reads these contracts?), The funds will be returned within a month, and in some cases, with the retention of a certain commission.  In the most fun cases, you have to file a lawsuit and wait for the bankruptcy of the company.  With an unpredictable result. <br><br>  Let's count.  For example, BigBazzy in 2012, launching the campaign ‚ÄúiPhone 4s with a 51% discount for 19990 rubles‚Äù, collected more than 50,000 orders for an amount approaching 1 billion rubles.  The company used this money for 3-5 months.  Perhaps, the collected money was simply in interest in the bank, perhaps it was used for the purchase of goods and advertising.  This is not very important.  But twisting a billion rubles for about half a year is very, very nice.  Some of the ‚Äúbuyers‚Äù were lucky, and they managed to get their money back, and someone was waiting for their order to this day. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4e4/688/ca6/4e4688ca6aa1475d839b00436e0d77ed.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Method 3. Sale of "restored" iPhone under the guise of new.</b> <br><br>  Often in the description of iPhones the words refurbished, ref, or simply "ref" are found.  Some sellers simply write this without explaining what the designation is, and some stores claim total novelty.  They say that the device is completely new, sealed, etc.  For those who still do not know what "ref", I will explain.  Vendors will talk about the iPhone, which the disgruntled buyers returned directly to the Apple Store, sent them to the factory, carefully tested, re-packaged and now sell at a big discount.  In fact, everything is a little sadder.  In Russian conditions, "ref" is an iPhone with low-quality Chinese parts.  Chinese everything is there - the screen, speaker, microphone, cables, antenna, bolts, etc.  Everything except the motherboard, so that the operating system was original.  The percentage of defects in such masterpieces tends to 100 percent.  Usually they live for a couple of months before the repair.  ‚ÄúRefs‚Äù are sold everywhere, but there are a lot of them according to the ads from private traders. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b90/ca0/612/b90ca06124fe48f1a18232d4411ffe17.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0c0/4f7/2c8/0c04f72c880a4293bca58f85fa1b1b8c.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Method 4. Selling Chinese iPhone fake under the guise of the original.</b> <br><br>  If you think that you can easily distinguish the Chinese copy of the iPhone on Android from the original, I‚Äôm very disappointed.  The copying skill has grown so much that even with a rather thoughtful eyeing the difference is hard to notice.  Well, except to put next to this machine and poke into all menu items. <br><br>  This disgrace is often sold under the guise of the original iPhone, and for greater persuasiveness they apply a check from Euroset or Svyaznoy.  The story is told a standard one: they gave me two things for my birthday, I sell an extra one with a big discount, I need money very much.  "Bought" in "Euroset" for 26990 rubles, the iPhone 5S will give you just 9000, and in the process of dialogue they will throw off a couple of thousand more.  They say that the pipes are burning, you really need to put out the fire. <br><br>  The check is printed on the cash printer, which is in all bars and restaurants.  You can buy your own - it costs from 2000 rubles.  The patch is constructed on an ordinary printer.  The stamps, as you know, can be ordered by print in almost any profile company.  With home delivery, one stamp will cost 500 rubles, and this will be home delivery. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a57/fc4/9e3/a57fc49e3e3346dcb7a24665198e5d17.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Method 5. Selling iPhone layout under the guise of the present.</b> <br><br>  For some, it is not a secret, but someone will know about it now for the first time.  If you see a pile of Apple products in a storefront or point on the radio market, these are not real devices, but their dummies.  First, laying out the originals is not safe.  Secondly, too expensive.  I note that they do the same for the hill. <br><br>  But there is another category of citizens who use these dummies for mercenary purposes.  Let's count the costs.  A model box is 300 rubles, an iPhone model is 900 rubles, a set of Chinese accessories is 150 rubles, shipping films are 50 rubles, the iPhone is sealed with a film - 50 rubles.  Post an ad on the bulletin board - for free.  Total is 1450 rubles.  To sell quickly, the price set low, for example, 19,000 rubles.  And an asset of 17550 rubles and slightly damaged karma. <br><br>  However, the model weighs much less than the original, and occasionally it is customized by weight.  Ask how you can confuse the model with a normal machine?  So after all the film is in place!  Immediately in sight, that novye.  Therefore, you can not even open up to the house.  Or the seller himself reverently cut the film and show that everything is new inside.  You have no idea how often this works. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/678/f2d/94f/678f2d94fdcd4ed7b22eaba19fe50f01.jpg"><br>  <i>author photo Andrey Kovalev</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d1b/c6f/c18/d1bc6fc18bec45d3acfe067be7a445d0.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Method 6. Selling a defective iPhone.</b> <br><br>  The scheme is similar to the previous one, only a little more costly for a fraudster.  The device, decently looking outside, but in fact dead, is pasted over with transport films, and the box is sealed in a factory film.  The announcement of the sale is given cheaply - and rushed. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/YOaHwhc2SzM%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700002,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhxL-GgMGLENnPWgfB66e_yzsrlhQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <i>This video is provided as a demonstration of packaging technology.</i>  <i>The company that provided the video is doing honest business.</i> <br><br>  <b>Method 7. Blocked under the operator iPhone.</b> <br><br>  The device bought in America with a contract for $ 200 is printed out, pasted on the back of the box with the bottom sticker with the device data, for example, from Germany, the box is sealed with factory tape and put up for sale for 19,000 rubles.  If you bought such a miracle, there is a chance to stumble upon scammers again, only others already.  In search of a way to unlock the iPhone, you will find a lot of sites that for a modest fee of $ 15 to $ 90 "untie" it from the operator of any country.  Of course, prepaid.  Well, you understand. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c13/5bd/997/c135bd997b3c4b6990fc730297dd06e2.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c54/74f/405/c5474f405ed04bddb6156305de0bc3b8.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Method 8. Robbery buyer.</b> <br><br>  Most frostbitten individuals expose the new iPhone 5S with 64 memory gigs of thousands for twelve rubles.  But they can meet only in the evening after work, in the Vykhino area at 22:00.  The goal is simple - to find the victim in the right place at the right time with cash in decent quantities.  And again you will not believe - how many lovers of freebies are ready to go for a cheap iPhone at night in Vykhino ... <br><br>  <b>Method 9. Fake SMS.</b> <br><br>  The buyer finds an ad for the sale of an iPhone, cheaply and without prepayment.  Unfortunately, the seller is located in the farthest region of the Russian Federation (these famous Chukchi iPhones!), But sends orders via DHL.  The buyer makes an order, leaving the delivery address, phone number and name.  After 3-5 days SMS arrives to your number.  The sender indicates the DHL, and inside the text that the parcel arrived with your iPhone 6, you must specify the shipment number for receipt.  You contact the seller, and he asks for payment, after which he will inform the number of the shipment.  Since in DHL without a shipment number they cannot provide you with any information, many are kept on it.  And the SMS was actually sent by the attacker. <br><br>  <b>Method 10. Selling an iPhone with the Find iPhone feature enabled and an active Apple ID.</b> <br><br>  The first clever men with similar frauds appeared relatively recently, 9-10 months ago.  With the release of iOS 7, it became possible to remove the device via your Apple ID when it was stolen or lost.  It is impossible to unblock such a device, but its location on the map is easily traced. <br><br>  As a result, the divorce looks like this.  The gullible buyer buys a used vehicle, and a day later it receives the message ‚ÄúThis phone has been stolen.  I know your location.  Call the number ... and return the iPhone, or I am writing a statement to the police. "  After that, the device is blocked.  In addition to the location, the victim‚Äôs phone number is also known.  In 95% of cases, such a device is returned to the owner, and a day later it is put up for sale again.  And so on to infinity.  If the potential victim does not return the phone, a statement is written to the police with the provision of available data, after which the phone is confiscated.  According to the same scheme, they can block your personal iPhone by hijacking your mail and asking for a ransom in the amount of 500-3000 rubles.  Still, they say, photos can steal. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/201/6b1/13a/2016b113a0c1482b9f35d3348b1a08e1.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Method 11. Selling the original iPhone with a further substitution on a copy or layout.</b> <br><br>  In this method, the name speaks for itself.  You meet the seller, you check the really original new device, but at some point the attacker changes it to a fake.  Slight dexterity, but how many impressions. <br><br>  <b>Method 12. Sale of knowingly defective iPhone.</b> <br><br>  This method is often practiced on Yandex Market.  In search of cheap options, you stumble upon a store with more than 1000 reviews and 5 stars.  Without reading reviews (after all, five stars is enough), you place an order and wait for delivery.  A courier arrives, and at the door hands you an iPhone and documents for signature.  The patter voiced that the warranty is one year, a return-replacement within 14 days, asks to sign and is removed. <br><br>  Having found a marriage, you contact the store for a refund, they dictate the support service number that the brain is composted in various ways (send the order number, wait two days. Now send a copy of the receipt and wait two more days. Now we need a picture of the fault - and so on infinity).  The number is often busy and does not respond, respond to mail for a long time or do not respond at all.  Deciding to write a review on Yandex.Market, you are horrified to find out that there are already similar ones in bulk, but between them there is a lot of positive ones of the same type, many of which have been bought for 20 rubles each. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/181/914/083/1819140836e54cbb8b7c1f47d77e0c90.jpg"><br><br>  From the above methods of fraud suffer mainly buyers.  But the sellers of Apple technology are often the victims of villains. <br><br>  <b>Method 13. iPhone wholesale from 10 pieces.</b> <br><br>  There is an advertisement for the sale of iPhone 6 with 128 gigabytes on board at a price of 30,000 rubles, but the minimum order is 10-20 pieces.  Old-timers of the market do not even pay attention to such announcements, but the newly minted businessmen are very even.  You make an appointment (no money) to check if these are really iPhones, not ref, copy, dummy, etc.  And it turns out that the original is being sold, and the terms of the transaction are transparent: goods are money. <br><br>  Why is this done?  Yes, because the attackers now know what a potential victim looks like.  In the next meeting (or in front of her) there will be a successful or not very attempted robbery.  Or conditions will change to prepay. <br><br>  In some cases, resourceful dealers ring up sellers and online stores themselves with an offer to buy an iPhone cheaply.  So, for example, a couple of days ago one wise guy called everyone and offered ‚Äúsixes‚Äù for 128 GB for $ 750.  When he was told that the price was suspiciously low, he was already offering $ 850 to others.  Learn fast. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/baf/25b/20b/baf25b20bb47406cb3f732276c1719c5.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Method 14. Checking the iPhone for photos and videos.</b> <br><br>  The buyer is contacted by a buyer from another city, wanting to buy an iPhone.  He offers to send a full prepayment in any convenient way, plus 3,000 rubles for delivery costs.  For example, via DHL.  But before that, he wants to get a photo and video with a sealed box in order to make sure that it is new and not activated.  What can be done with this data - one can only guess.  Below I publish the dialogue and materials requested by the attacker.  My companion gently sent a man and posted on the site warning material indicating the phone number of this character.  After just a couple of days, a search query with a phone number began to arrive for 20-30 people per day.  That is, the cunning guy still managed to get photos and videos, and to dissolve dozens of people through this. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1a7/87e/9a2/1a787e9a2c6f4af0ad1e802d50fffac0.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4ae/351/f8c/4ae351f8c5c3416ab7ae174f083de5b2.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6bc/4a7/e05/6bc4a7e05fae458e90c68d77b32b309e.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Method 15. Robbery seller.</b> <br><br>  The most common way to cash in on the iPhone seller is brazen robbery in its various manifestations.  In the store or the seller order several iPhones more expensive, call the delivery address and wait for the courier at the entrance.  It even goes so far that the order is drawn up by a girl with a small child in the background.  Predominantly Oriental people are being robbed and guests from very central Asia.  No offense to it will be someone said, but so it is in 99% of cases.  Interestingly, an order is always drawn up by a person without an accent who speaks good Russian. <br><br>  <b>Method 16. Payment fake money.</b> <br><br>  Counterfeit denominations of 5000 or 1000 are bought on the black market for 50% of the nominal, or work for criminal elements at such a rate.  Next, make an order for an expensive iPhone - in the evening with urgent delivery or in advance, but with delivery in the evening.  With poor lighting, fake money is almost impossible to distinguish from real money.  During the day they can play a little scene.  The seller meets with the buyer, specifies the full amount to be paid, and then goes - supposedly - to withdraw money from the nearest ATM.  After 3 minutes, returns with new bills.  Not the most vigilant couriers and sellers often fall for this bait. <br><br>  <b>Method 17. Hall of money.</b> <br><br>  Also, often when buying multiple iPhones and iPads, they use a bill room.  The seller meets with the buyer, he takes the vehicles and transfers the money that the seller recounts, and there are not enough, for example, thousands.  The attacker is surprised, apologizes and asks for money back to recount on their own.  Yes, indeed, thousands are missing.  Then the crook gets another bill in 1000 rubles and reports to the total pack, but at the time of recalculation he bent about a third of the amount.  And in the process of getting an extra thousand, he hid the broken money.  Some sellers do not recheck money again and put it in their wallet.  With the same who is going to recount money anew, the following happens. ,    ,     ,  ,    ,    ,    .   . <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/4nl2lhIJcdg&amp;xid=25657,15700002,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhg6mOoqDvD3tYRVqBPZX9gkDSW3rw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br> <b> 18.        .</b> <br><br>        Molotok.        ,         SMS,     ,  .     : <br><br> ‚Äî    ? <br> ‚Äî    ¬´¬ª . <br> ‚Äî ,  ,     ,     . <br><br>   .       . <br><br> ‚Äî     ,          . <br><br>   ‚Ä¶ <br><br> ‚Äî    50 ,  ,      . <br>  SMS   : ‚Äú   50      Beeline  ‚Äù. <br><br>    5   SMS, ,  50  .      3000 .
