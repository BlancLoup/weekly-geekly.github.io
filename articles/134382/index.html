  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Side effects of autopilot in the car</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Google has been working on the development of unmanned vehicles for several years.  The main and obvious reason why humanity needs it is security.  Every year, about <a href="http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/publications/road_traffic/world_report/en/index.html">1.2 million</a> people die on the roads, and 50 million are injured (0.71% of the world's population).  For comparison, in the First World War about 2.3 million people died per year.  Only the First World War ended in four years, and the modern ‚Äúwar‚Äù has been going on for several decades without a stop, and there is no end in sight.  The number of accidents will decrease only in one case - if there is no person behind the wheel. <br><br>  Automation has other implications.  Developer Kushik Dutta (Koushik Dutta) <a href="https://plus.google.com/103583939320326217147/posts/TpN1g1oSVbN">talks</a> in his blog about how much the auto industry will change thanks to autopilot.  He gives a simple example: at present, the utilization rate (CI) of cars is a measly 4%, that is, almost all the time the car is idle in the garage or in the parking lot.  For comparison, passenger aircraft CI is 96%, and rightly so - the technique must work continuously, otherwise it will simply rust, become obsolete and lose its value without paying for itself. <br><br>  Thanks to the autopilot, we can raise the KI of the car to the same 96%.  The same car can get me to work first, then go home and transport my wife, then go for a child and other business.  You can also use the machine with neighbors. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Increased CI has side effects.  Just think, because the problem of parking in cities will disappear by itself.  Cars will not stand idle, they do not need parking spaces.  This means that the appearance of cities will change, disfigured by a huge cluster of immovable metal.

      There will be new corporations that will manage the public fleet (maybe the same Google) and sell access to cars according to simple tariff plans: for example, $ 5 per 100 km or $ 200 per month for anlim.  You can call your car by simply pressing a button on your smartphone. <br><br>  It would seem that if cars are used 20 times more intensively, this means a decrease in car sales by 20 times.  Such a decline in sales will completely change the market; most manufacturers will simply go bankrupt.  By the way, it is rather strange that the auto industry has not yet connected its powerful lobbying resource in order to nip any scientific research in this field.  On the contrary, many of them began their own research on the automation of driving.  At first glance, for them, the autopilot is very dangerous.  Although, maybe not. <br><br>  We can only assume what additional side effects the future carries.  Maybe car sales will not go down at all, and people will start using vehicles in new ways.  For example, there will appear "mobile homes" and mobile offices.  A person can set up a bed, an office space in his van - and instruct the car to travel around the most picturesque corners of the country to work in a creative setting, watching the change of beautiful landscapes outside the window.  You can send a car on a journey thousands of kilometers away, meeting each new dawn in a new country, and live like this for years. <br><br>  The number and distance of car travel will surely increase if people can sleep, read and go about their business on the road.  Riding to work for 3-4 hours every day will also not be stressful at all: on the way you can make breakfast, watch TV, iron clothes and prepare a report for the morning meeting. <br><br>  Improving the efficiency of vehicles will remove a huge press, which is now putting pressure on the global economy.  In general, the damage to the world economy from traffic accidents is estimated at about <a href="http://www.searo.who.int/LinkFiles/whd04_Documents_un_secretary_general_report_on_orad_traffic_injuries.pdf">$ 0.52 trillion per</a> year.  Millions of people are dying on the roads, and hundreds of millions of others are involved in the extraction of metal and oil, working in factories producing spare parts, working in auto repair shops / gas stations / parking lots / roadside services / taxis, building roads and maintaining the infrastructure that is needed to service billions of cars.  Switching to autopilots will allow abolishing some outdated professions: taxi drivers, traffic police inspectors, valet parking, etc. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/134382/">https://habr.com/ru/post/134382/</a></p>
