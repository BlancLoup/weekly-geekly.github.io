      PROLOGUE <br><br>  It was an ordinary December day.  In the depths of a British company that modestly called itself ‚Äúthe number one company on the IT market of Ukraine‚Äù, in the heart of its headquarters in the glorious city of Dnepropetrovsk, a letter was born with a scary name in the style of Russian classicism ‚ÄúCrime and Punishment‚Äù.  Thunder did not thunder, no lightning flashed, Universal Evil did not erupt from heaven to earth.  But the letter was born ... <br><br>  Even literally on the eve, somewhere bustling, somewhere not very, the country confidently went to the new year.  Online stores were preparing for New Year's sales, and price comparison catalogs nervously rubbed their sweating hands, counting the profits that these stores would bring to them, placing their offers on their resources.  And then the alarm bell rang.  One by one, leading Internet shops began to disconnect from ‚ÄúCompany No. 1‚Äù, and the golden mountains that seemed so close and real suddenly turned into a mirage and, trembling, began to rapidly dissolve in the pre-holiday air, leaving behind gray streaks of ash ... <br><br>  WHO?  WHAT FOR?  WHY? <br><br>  In its official statement, Price.ua informs about the alleged ‚Äúrumors‚Äù that were disseminated by large online stores and the ‚Äúconspiracy‚Äù committed by these stores against ‚ÄúCompany No. 1 on the IT market of Ukraine‚Äù, as the price list modestly calls itself. aggregator.  In order to no longer have interpretations and discrepancies, the owners of online stores decided to publicly respond to the statement of Price.ua, openly formulated their position: the reason for disconnecting stores from Price was the unsatisfactory management of the company and unprofessional approach to running the online business as a whole. <br><br>  Once again, now publicly, we set out claims that have been repeatedly expressed to the managers of the company in written and oral form.  The claims that, in the end, served as a weighty argument in favor of breaking the business relationship with Price.ua.  And the first thing we intend to refute is the statements regarding the "conspiracy."  There was no conspiracy, and could not be.  Simply, people with many years of experience in the field of Internet sales compared their performance and made sure that it was not profitable to invest money in Price.ua.  Why?  We read below. <br><br>  In the section "About the System" on the main page of Price.ua it is said that "Price.ua is a convenient and powerful mechanism for finding the right product, a tool for analyzing offers on the market, help in choosing the right product."  But despite such a loud self-advertisement, in the postscript you can notice that "the administration is not responsible for the information posted by advertisers."  This is the work style of ‚ÄúPrice‚Äù, the main purpose of which is to earn money, not to develop your portal and certainly not to help customers or contribute to the development of online stores.  By the way, we note that many online trading players appeared and earned the trust of consumers long before the appearance of this price aggregator and owed their success to extremely competent management and high professionalism of their teams, numbering dozens or even hundreds of jobs in their teams. <br><br>  In our opinion, there are several main points that, having eradicated, Price.ua, may be able to recapture the partners who generated the main income of this company, as well as get new loyal customers: <br><br>  1. Price's usability is initially not focused on helping consumers identify a product and acquire it as efficiently as possible, but on entangling a user in order to receive additional money from advertising accounts of vendors.  Judge for yourself: when you click on the active link ‚Äúname of the store,‚Äù the buyer enters the customer‚Äôs card, and the amount is already withdrawn from your account - for what?  Did the store get a visitor?  On the card page, the buyer clicks on the website‚Äôs Internet address - and again, almost 2 hryvnias are taken from the seller‚Äôs account in the Price box.  Clicking the ‚ÄúDetails‚Äù link on the product right below the store address again throws the user onto the customer‚Äôs card - and again minus the store balance.  But the buyer just wanted to learn more about the product.  If near the name of your site is a VIP prefix, the cost of such an empty click increases!  But about VIPs separately ... <br><br>  2. Creation of a new category ‚ÄúVIP-company‚Äù is intended solely for the purpose of withdrawing additional funds from the accounts of hosted online stores.  After all, who is our ‚ÄúVIP‚Äù today?  The one who for an additional fee decided to show off there.  And it does not matter that one of the ‚ÄúVIPs‚Äù is not able to pay off creditors, the second lives only with loans from acquaintances, and the third - the director, manager, and driver in one person ... <br><br>  3. The outdated interface and inconvenient usability of the portal suggests that its owners are not burdened with the development of their offspring.  At a minimum, it is necessary to organize headings and categories in such a way that cameras do not occur among washing machines, and pocket PCs among laptops.  In addition, the resource, which has claims to be called "number one", should not take place goods without photos, at least in the "sales hits". <br><br>  4. Have you ever wondered what the expression ‚ÄúFair Prices‚Äù means, placed on a separate tab?  We are thinking.  It turns out that, in principle, all prices on the portal are ‚Äúdishonest‚Äù, but if you want to know ‚Äúfair prices‚Äù - you need a separate tab.  True, here is more expensive ... <br><br>  5. The fact that the data posted on the main page of the portal is false is also inadmissible for honest business relationships: instead of 980 firms declared at Price.ua as partners, they are actually placed almost 4 times less.  And among the companies represented, there are also those who have not been working with Price for more than two months now. <br><br>  6. A significant array of clicks from Price.ua is pornotrafik.  It is enough to follow the "Googleland" to verify this.  But let's not go far and disclose the commercial information of online stores.  Just look at the open statistics of Bigmir: sites actively promoted by Price.ua have visitors who do not linger on them for more than one and a half seconds!  Online stores, which in December 2008 refused the services of Price, noted an increase in the viewing depth on their sites to 20‚Äì60%, which translated into e-commerce means real customer, and not empty clicks. <br><br>  7. ‚ÄúThe customer is not a wolf - he will not run away to the forest‚Äù, therefore on Price.ua there is a complete lack of customer support.  A banner places personally "top manager" who likes to sleep, or busy with more important things - and let the banner wait.  At Price.ua there are no employees who can make a profitable commercial offer to a large client, there is no possibility to return funds that were not spent on clicks, the main traffic runs in over the weekend, and the portal management ‚Äúis not responsible for anything‚Äù.  The company is more concerned about the calculation of their income, rather than providing quality service. <br><br>  8. Incorrect behavior of Price.ua managers, who, by their unprofessionalism and incompetence in the basics of Internet business, created obstacles for fruitful cooperation with this company.  Confidence in impunity and narcissism resulted in a letter with a pathetic title ‚ÄúCrime and Punishment‚Äù.  Even one title is an eloquent example of the approach to business and building relationships with customers.  The text is a public prosecution of a number of large online stores and an attempt to rehabilitate its reputation at their expense.  When reading this opus, I remember the proverb about who shouts the loudest "hold the thief ..." And all this instead of, as is customary in the entire business world, to draw conclusions from their mistakes and miscalculations, put the site in order, train command, clean traffic. <br>  As a result, in the pursuit of easy money, the price aggregator has lost its most reliable partners. <br><br>  And in conclusion: the overwhelming majority of those stores that deliberately refused the services of Price.ua, never had the goal of receiving for themselves ‚Äúspecial conditions‚Äù and, accordingly, they could not talk about any ‚Äúpreferences‚Äù. <br><br>  Our goal was to attract customers, and not to buy expensive and low-quality Internet traffic. <br><br>  And the termination of cooperation with this company was a balanced position of people who had been developing their business for many years, who knew the price of high-quality clicks and refused obviously unprofitable offers. <br><br>  EPILOGUE <br><br>  In its latest statements, Price.ua assures ever-growing incomes and new successes.  We are sincerely happy for them.  Any honest and competent business deserves respect and decent remuneration.  But - only honest and competent ... sensitively listening to the wishes of their customers and at least consistent with the basics of Internet sales. <br><br>  Successes and prosperity! <br><br>  Example: <br>  <a href="http://shop.aivo.com.ua/index.php%3Ftarget%3Dnews%26news_id%3D20">shop.aivo.com.ua/index.php?target=news&amp;news_id=20#20</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.rozetka.com.ua/ru/companynews/id/307/index.html">www.rozetka.com.ua/ru/companynews/id/307/index.html</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/52602/">https://habr.com/ru/post/52602/</a></p>
