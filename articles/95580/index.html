Well, in the text, let blacklight and ultraviolet light be synonymous for convenience.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Manufacturers now make a lot of computer elements glowing in the ultraviolet, right up to <a title="Habraffe.ru" href="">the motherboards</a> . <br>  How to remove them, and let's talk ... <br><br><h4>  What is required for U.F.  shooting? </h4><br><br><ol><li>  In 99% of cases, the background is <a href="http://foto.ru/professional_fon_plastikovyy_0.7x1.0_m._chernyy.html">black</a> , although with white you can sometimes get interesting effects.  By the way, a sheet of black paper or a piece of black cloth is also suitable. </li><li>  220V <a href="http://www.pcdesign.ru/tovar/200044.html">UV lamp</a> - one or more.  (Of course, there are Black Light lamps for modding a computer that connect to a 12V power supply. But I would recommend using 220V UV lamps for photographing.) </li><li>  Mirror, honeycomb, plexiglass - optional. </li></ol><br><br><h5>  Info </h5><br><br>  In general, for a professional "subject" you need a lot and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DrqC2xpCaG80">a lot of lighting equipment</a> (take a look at your leisure, good video). <br>  But in the case of blacklight shooting, this is not the case, for all these expensive softboxes, umbrellas, external flashes, studio lights, etc.  - usually meaningless in the ultraviolet (with rare exceptions). <br><br>  So shoot professionally in the blacklight spectrum is available to everyone at the lowest cost. <br><br><h5>  Build article: </h5><br>  The article is based on the principle. <br>  The name, then the photo, a gray gif-picture with the settings of the camera from LightRoom and a brief comment about the objects and how it was filmed. <br><br><h6>  Blacklight still life </h6><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/ca/51/ca51833dee80738ba290cca2d0bd089e.jpg"></div><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/cf/bd/cfbdce0c53f45f6ca165b265580a7e75.gif" align="left">  For shooting this still life used one UV lamp.  She lay on the side, a little bit aside, that is, she was not directed straight and on the forehead.  Aperture 14, shutter speed for half a second.  In general, over time, it came to the conclusion that it is better to shoot uv with a ‚Äúhole‚Äù of 10 or even 7.1. <br><br>  Ordinary glass was used as a background. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><h6>  Pink UV-active fan </h6><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/06/89/06896422b5b1f13b8a6f904adfb5ba45.jpg" alt="image" align="left"><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/a0/f7/a0f787a1d93081afd1b485a8622b1221.gif" alt="image"></div><br>  This fan had low UV activity, that is, it didn‚Äôt glow as brightly as ordinary UV baubles.  Perhaps this is a feature <br>  pink surfaces.  Therefore, I had to light it from different sides.  I put a long shutter speed of 3 seconds, I took an ultraviolet lamp in my hand and during those 3 seconds I lit the fan from different sides.  In general, he wielded the uv-lamp as a light brush. <br><br>  As a background (substrate) it was normal glass again. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><h6>  Blacklight injection </h6><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/d5/f5/d5f5ccd1d1cb80414386a3fa2ab3db64.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/a8/56/a85676b5f5d6038033c048d43b04feb8.gif" alt="image" align="left">  <s>I am preparing for the questions: ‚ÄúDoctor, where do you get these pictures from?‚Äù</s> . <br>  In fact, a fluorescent liquid is taken here to be added to the NWO.  From it, the water in the hoses begins to glow in the UV (see the next photo), and, they say, less blooms, and less start up bacteria.  Well, with the help of a syringe it was very convenient to pour it there. <br><br>  Photographed an old Olympus E-300 SLR (albeit with a macro lens). <br>  All this lay on a glass coffee table, and I was shining from below and a little to the side with an ultraviolet lamp. <br><br><br><br><br><h6>  Water cooling hard drive </h6><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/3f/1d/3f1d4e01db9dc5e11253a1bb08fb79d6.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/a0/d5/a0d542570a7b5b2d87c74400f0fad70c.gif" alt="image" align="left">  This is not a moonshine, and zmeevichok for cooling the hard disk.  It is inside an acrylic case with a copper plate. <br><br>  It was difficult to shoot, because it was hard to approach the hull.  So the same principle was used as with the pink fan.  The shutter speed was set to 2.5 seconds, well, and during that time I tried to illuminate the required areas with a lamp. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><h6>  A set of fluorescent paints </h6><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/1a/dc/1adc0ea4bdc47935dc07b9b70484ef30.jpg" alt="image" align="left"><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/19/17/1917433b1a183e0a1a0606b25e044cd6.gif" alt="image"></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/4b/2f/4b2fc729e75a7594905d6adead5024ed.jpg" alt="image"></div><br>  With the help of these paints you can draw on the iron, creating blacklight-pictures.  As, for example, in the photo above (the photo is not mine). <br><br>  When shooting paints on the left, I installed a UV lamp, and on the right a dim soft box.  He made light stripes on jars and added extra volume. <br>  Although, as I wrote above, softboxes are rarely needed. <br><br><h6>  Fluorescent Red Plexiglas Sheet </h6><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/50/7c/507c6320ad3242c3c960c39bcc09d8ba.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/d4/2f/d42f48ca83dc6e3aab5b505d0817d9e2.gif" alt="image" align="left">  Such sheets are used in modding often.  Someone makes <a href="">uv-active windows in the case</a> , well, someone grinds out the <a href="http://www.pcdesign.ru/catalog/51">grilles</a> on the fan, and some even the <a href="http://www.slipperybrick.com/2009/11/nvidia-ion-cube-pc-mod/">computer case</a> . <br><br>  I posted these pictures to show that black is not always good as a background.  The camera settings were the same for red and green acrylic, so the lightroom infa is also the same.  Sometimes pleasant effects create <a href="http://foto.ru/professional_fon_plastikovyy_0.7x1.0_m._belyy.html">white backgrounds</a> that immediately turn blue and shining in the UV light.  (You know how white clothes shine in nightclubs and discos).  Here, instead of a plastic background, a sheet of milky-white glossy plexiglass was used, and he created a reflection. <br><br>  There is one BUT - blue objects will merge against this background.  Therefore, in the case of blue objects, it is better to stick to the classic black background. <br><br><h6>  Fluorescent fan Revoltec orange with blue blades and backlight </h6><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/0e/52/0e522200948bb84268800aa697150b60.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/12/d3/12d394c71c85658e2b3f6d641137bdfb.gif" alt="image" align="left">  Very nice fan.  The orange frame and blue blades just shone.  Voodoo lamp was lying on the side, slightly to the side.  I put a mirror on a sheet of black plastic, and already a fan on the mirror.  Then in a photoshop I blurred a bit (I made a fuzzy reflection). <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><h6>  Acid Green Braid Kit </h6><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/89/d2/89d21cc8dd035765d791b2f11b742544.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/f5/3b/f53be7e7d075577f83cd653d52f01724.gif" alt="image" align="left"><br>  Green sheath to restore order in the wires. <br><br>  I shot 5 years ago with an ordinary digital camera.  Now, of course, would have taken off differently.  But even then it turned out quite acceptable result.  So not only light equipment is not very necessary, but also expensive cameras are not decisive for shooting in the UV spectrum. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><h6>  ATX 20-pin connector, red, glows in the ultraviolet </h6><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/b6/2d/b62d5e70767d4e7c5617d612398adeb8.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/bc/1f/bc1f029a56209f509e7cd4d5421aa844.gif" alt="image" align="left">  Glowing connector for the motherboard.  The lamp was on the side of the left, and I kept the mirror on the right and used it as a reflector.  Thus, the right side was illuminated, although for good it was necessary to use several lamps. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  If you are interested, it is <a href="http://forum.modding.ru/viewtopic.php%3Ft%3D27565">possible to read something</a> about the harm (and benefits) of black light or Wood lamps (English Black light, Wood's light). <br>  This article shows only a few objects and photos from UV, in fact, a great many fluorescent objects and objects. <br>  Taking pictures in UV is very easy (in my humble opinion).  I will try with time to continue on Habr√© my notes on the photo of funny glands. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/95580/">https://habr.com/ru/post/95580/</a></p>
