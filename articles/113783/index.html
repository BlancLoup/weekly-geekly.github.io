  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Distree XXL: Blu-ray player on Intel Atom, keyboard for tablet PCs and others</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It‚Äôs not the first year that no one wants the current development of the Internet in a classical form, and the only benefit from them is to establish personal contacts between buyers and sellers.  Personally, it seems to me that personal contacts are three-quarters of success in life, but perhaps I am too old-fashioned.  A recent visit to the Consumer Electronics Show in Vegas made one doubt the inevitable death of the ‚Äúoffline‚Äù - it was very painful, bright, powerful and abundant.  And yet, for contrast, I decided to visit the Distree XXL all-European event, where the show element was reduced to almost zero and everything was ‚Äúsharpened‚Äù for creating and strengthening personal connections between large companies and equally large sellers. <br><br>  The press on Distree was not lured by rolls, because no one was going to represent meganovinki, and a crowd of curious journalists would only interfere with power talks on business and the meaning of life.  At the same time, those who came at their own expense were not expelled from Monte Carlo, and I managed to peep some interesting devices, which I will now tell you about. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Do you know the company Arctic Cooling, a manufacturer of very high-quality coolers of different caliber?  At Distree, it was found that it has expanded its product range, and very thoroughly.  Now, under the brand of Arctic, you can buy wired and Bluetooth-headphones (with just excellent sound, I checked), mobile chargers with solar batteries, radio-controlled toys, and just like that, not afraid of the word, charm.

The Windows 7 interface is neatly ‚Äúcommunicated‚Äù so that it can be controlled from a regular remote control.  In games and video decoding, the Radeon 5430 graphics chip with 512 MB of memory onboard helps.  The Arctic Senses has four gigabytes of memory, and the hard disk size is half a byte.  Of course, there is support for WiFi 802.11n and USB 3.0.  The guys from the Arctic with pleasure emphasize that their device can simultaneously show a movie, download something useful and stream music from Internet radio to the next room (or even a movie, if there is a TV with a decoder or some player with network interface). <br><br>  It seemed to me even more important that Senses is not positioned as a next nettop, but as an advanced Blu-ray player.  There even there are no propellers inside, and only an optical drive can make noise.  When this machine will reach Russia (and it will arrive unequivocally), I will certainly take the test.  By the way, people developing the famous IconBit brand have said that they are almost ready to have a very similar device.  We are waiting for an analog from Samsung or Sony?  :) <br><br>  As I wrote <a href="http://vilianov.com/world/ces-2011/">in a report from CES</a> , dozens of tablet PCs with ‚Äúatoms‚Äù were represented in Las Vegas.  All are good in their own way, but personally I was saddened by the inability to play them in something good-old in marching conditions.  In Max Payne, for example, Atom pulls him well, but without a keyboard, no joy. So, hooray!  The well-known Russian company Dune HD will soon begin selling a miniature wireless keyboard with a touchpad, dubbed Dune HD Qwerty. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/610/f65/c82/610f65c826f4831bcf3dd1c6bf5cc9b9.jpg" alt="distree"><br><br>  It is compatible with Dune players, game consoles and PCs, and popular Linux distributions are also supported out of the box.  I tried and, frankly, stunned by convenience.  If the tablet has a normal case that allows you to install it on a horizontal surface, with Dune HD Qwerty you have a real computer.  If you want to play games, you want to write letters, you want to walk around the Internet with complete comfort - unless, of course, the connection is at hand.  In Europe, this baby is already for sale, and in our area it will appear in just a couple of weeks and will cost about 2000 rubles.  It seems to me that, given the convenience and versatility, it is a very good investment. <br><br>  For those who want to save money, an option of a mobile keyboard will soon appear simpler - from Gembird.  It rolls into a roller, works via USB or Bluetooth and will cost 600 rubles. Of course, there is no touchpad and you don‚Äôt use it as a joystick, but it's still much more convenient than typing on the screen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4f2/fe2/3f9/4f2fe23f934f56fd66b90720f2a10265.jpg" alt="distree"><br>  Gigabyte showed her Atom tablet with a hard drive on board.  He was so popular with distributors that I didn‚Äôt even manage to erase all the fingerprints from him - I photographed it as it is. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/edf/71e/8fb/edf71e8fba32cb9e2e8a946104027461.jpg" alt="distree"><br><br>  And for those who love more powerful, in Gigabyte, following their business colleagues, they made such a hybrid of a laptop and a tablet on the Core i5 of a new generation.  Considering how quickly the prices for touchscreens are falling, there is a feeling that very soon there will simply be no "unfeeling" laptops.  One pity: the years go by, and they do not invent a special coating protecting the surface of the screen from slipping.  Then believe in the absolute power of science ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bd8/7ae/240/bd87ae24024ccd8c43dda11ab7257c06.jpg" alt="distree"><br><br>  At Distree, several more interesting models of dual-frequency routers were shown: as planned <br>  developers, not very important traffic can be started at 2.4 GHz, and very important - at 5 GHz.  The idea is good: very few people are pleased when he is felled in ‚Äúcounter‚Äù, because his girlfriend decided to open a page with hundreds of pretty flash cards in honor of St. Valentine.  But, firstly, five gigahertz in our country are not very legal, and, secondly, we will wait until the routers appear on Atom - and then we will tell about them in this blog.  And they will appear, because homemade with such functionality already works a lot, and the industry just loves to draw ideas from homebrew. <br><br>  Once again, Distree XXL is not an exhibition of megano-books and concepts, as launched by Mobile World Congress, but, in fact, a fair.  They show products that, according to manufacturers, will be sold best.  Well, how everything will turn out in reality - depends, oddly enough, on you and me. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/113783/">https://habr.com/ru/post/113783/</a></p>
