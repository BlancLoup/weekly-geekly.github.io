The provider complied, stating that he no longer had a choice but to defend his rights. <br><br>  The block will continue until the end of a civil lawsuit filed by several companies, including Disney, Universal, Warner, Columbia, Sony, NBC and Paramount.

      Rick Falkvinge, the leader of the Pirate Party, said: ‚ÄúThis is ridiculous.  The court seems to consider itself above the Constitution, "in criticism that these civil claims restrict freedom of speech.  ‚ÄúIt clarifies how copyright becomes insolvent and that the judiciary lacks political experience,‚Äù he added. <br><br>  Black Internet is probably not the only provider of The Pirate Bay, so the possibility of reconnecting elsewhere is not excluded.  In any case, it is doubtful that another Swedish provider will connect TPB. <br><br>  <b>UPDATE:</b> <b><br></b> <br>  As expected, the Pirate Bay site has moved and returned to the Internet.  The Pirate Bay insider told TorrentFreak that they ‚Äúgot a new connection to the network.‚Äù As we were told, the tracker is not yet available and is expected to be fully available tomorrow morning.  Since searches were conducted on their servers back in 2006, they were prepared for such attacks. <br><br>  ‚ÄúMAFIAA spent millions of dollars, and an infinite amount of time, to get this ban.  We believe that they also bribed a little in order to achieve this, because they violate so many laws, not only in Sweden, but also in the EU, not to mention violations of human rights.  And what did they get as a result?  3 hours of partial downtime, ‚Äùadds the Pirate Bay team. <br><br>  The T-shirt (currently the logo on the Pirate Bay main page) will be sent tomorrow morning to the people responsible for the disconnection attempt, Pirate Bay insider told TorrentFreak. <br><br>  <b>ANOTHER UPDATE</b> <br><br>  The temporary host has communication problems, causing the site to become unavailable again.  At the same time, a simple server causes an increased load on other trackers. <br><br>  According to Peter Sunde on <a href="http://twitter.com/brokep">Twitter, the</a> problem is also with Swedish ISPs. <br><br>  <b>LAST UPDATE</b> <br><br>  The site is available. <br><br>  Press release of The Pirate Bay: <br><br>  <b>Out of the storm.</b> <br><br>  We are fully confident that if everyone performs his duty without neglecting anything, and if everything is done, as now, we will prove that we can once again protect our Internet, go through the storm of war, endure the threat of tyranny, if necessary over the years and alone. <br><br>  Although most of the Internet and a lot of old and well-known trackers have got into or can get into the clutches of IFPI and the entire infamous office of the MPAA, we will not give up and will not fail.  We will go to the end, we will fight in France, we will fight in chat rooms and anonymous networks, we will fight with ever-growing confidence and strength.  We will protect our Internet, it is possible even at any cost.  We will fight on the beaches, in the baywords.org blogs, on /.  (slashdot.org) and on Digg.  We will fight in the courts, we will never surrender.  And if, in what I never cease to believe, the Internet or most of it is enslaved and depressed, then our Empire beyond the seas, armed and guarded by a fleet of high-speed fleet, will continue to fight, while in good times Cerf, New World, with all its power and power, will step to salvation and deliverance from the old. <br><br>  <i>Signed;</i> <br><br>  <i>The Pirate Bay team - whenever necessary.</i> <br><br>  Sources: <br>  <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/the-pirate-bay-taken-offline-by-swedish-authorities-090824/">Torrentfreak</a> <br>  <a href="http://thepiratebay.org/blog/172">The Pirate Bay Blog</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/67871/">https://habr.com/ru/post/67871/</a></p>
