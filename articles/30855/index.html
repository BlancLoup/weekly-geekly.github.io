  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Learn promotes sponsored communities</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The administration of Live Journal <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/lj_biz/237534.html">reported</a> that in the near future will begin the promotion of communities sponsored by third-party companies.  Also LJ-users will be offered additional - sponsored opportunities.  The company Six Apart, which owns LJ, led the development for several months, but made an official announcement just now.  The first reaction of the LJ community, judging by the comments to the announcement, is negative. <br><br>  Sponsored communities (communities) will be administered by advertisers and offer their members exclusive information, such as movie trailers, shots from the filming of new films, travel tips, special commercial offers, etc.  Funny: I thought that all this has long been available on the Internet.  This idea is without a doubt a big potential, other social networks are also moving in this direction, but this is a really difficult strategy. <br><br>  Although something more viable has been proposed - sponsored opportunities for users, that is, those that have not yet been offered to ZhZhtam, because  could not be implemented by the administration without outside assistance.  The first innovation will be sms-integration - the publication of posts using SMS (service will be provided with the support of <a href="http://get.ampd.com/">Amp'dMobile</a> ).

        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

      Two things are troubling.  LJ offers paid accounts - and it is unlikely that a user who wants to pay for an account will be happy with the prospect of seeing ads.  However, the SMS service will be available only to paid users.  Let's see how they react to paying and seeing ads at the same time. <br><br>  For any social networks (it doesn't matter if they cost a penny or a million dollars) it is very important to monitor your image.  A balance should be struck between the desire to earn and how satisfied such users are so inconstant in their opinion. <br><br>  Anxiety is also aroused by how the ‚Äúpolicy of sponsored opportunities‚Äù will affect the openness of the API.  Will I have to pay for the integration with the LJ platform?  Or will the API remain open to programming, but only sponsors can fully integrate their products with LJ?  It will be interesting to see the result. <br><br>  Social networks show excellent results in terms of the number of page views, but many doubt a large number of clicks on advertising banners.  In the sponsored communities there is nothing new: they exist in many, if not even in all social networks, but the sponsored opportunities for users are something new.  If something comes out of this, we will be able to see how this will appear on other services.  Maybe someone will sponsor messaging on MySpace ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/30855/">https://habr.com/ru/post/30855/</a></p>
