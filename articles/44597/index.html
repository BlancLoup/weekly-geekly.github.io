      Modern ‚ÄúPolitical Economy‚Äù as a science developed in the 19th century.  The goals of its creators are not original: to find the scientific basis for improving this world, and it was considered then that the maximization of the material well-being (satisfaction of needs) of a society (industrial-capitalist) under the institution of private property was considered a blessing. <br>  Because  This science took materialism and bourgeois abstract philosophy as its basis, then this resulted in the creation and introduction of the following dialectical myths into the minds of people (directly from the definition of economics as a science from Wikipedia): <br>  - limited resources - the law of nature, i.e.  there are always more needs than resources (ready-made sedative virus program for the working class) <br>  - fair distribution of resources - ‚Äúyou work more (you create resources) - you get more‚Äù (in weak dependence on the real benefits of what you do) <br>  - the main pleasure of a person is the possession of material resources and their use <br><br>  Being incorporated into the mass consciousness, these myths gave rise to a social life-game called ‚Äúfree market‚Äù, which everyone now has to play, like or dislike.  Moreover, this game is ‚Äúall against all‚Äù - global competition, and the goal of life (winning) is programmed in the minds of each participant with a powerful global machine of ideological influence ‚Äî advertising and the media. <br>  Of course, I also want to say about the communist theory of society :) but everyone is already too familiar with it ... <br><br>  What happened today in the world of such that the ‚Äúeconomy‚Äù was not provided for by science? <br>  The answer is a reassessment of life values.  Because of the unnatural programming impact of capitalist advertising, people have forgotten their true desires, and now, they painfully recall. <br>  What did the creators of the first economic theory lose sight of?  The most important human desire is a feeling of a full-fledged existence in a peaceful, harmonious society, a feeling of the real connection of people with each other, their own usefulness to society and specific people.  Saint-Exup√©ry was right: "The only luxury is the luxury of human communication."  And material - only as a necessity. <br>  Another mistake is incorrect comparison of the goal of the participant in the economic system and the goal of the aggregate system.  The very first goal of the whole system should be - ensuring the vital needs of each member of society. <br>  Another mistake is the natural infinity of human desires.  In fact, they are easily amenable to social programming and restriction.  And the advertisement of material values ‚Äã‚Äãis not the ‚Äúengine of trade‚Äù, but ‚Äúthe main public carcinogen‚Äù. <br><br>  And what will happen next, what can we do, and how to cash in on it? <br>  Now there is a tendency towards cooperation rather than competition - and this is the main positive result of the crisis. <br>  First of all, the cooperation will concern the sphere of business information support: <br>  - creation of a global information system for monitoring the needs of members of society.  This will allow each company not to spend money on marketing research and obtain a reliable picture of the market, cooperate with direct competitors, and, as a result, establish a natural balance of supply and demand, if necessary, switching to barter. <br>  - you need to advertise <i>_ only unlimited</i> resources !!!  (information, art, spirituality, pleasure from altruism) <br><br>  I think that those who will be the first to make such a ‚Äústock exchange of demand‚Äù will get quite good chances for success and popularity, because ‚Äúpublic demand‚Äù has never been fully considered as a resource.  And everyone who will add their own <b>_real_</b> need to this base will be aware of the real benefits that it provides to society, enabling someone to feel useful and do something really useful for another - that is,  feel the real meaning of your existence in this society! :) <br><br>  I think I successfully put everything on its head, but it will be so in the foreseeable future :)) <br><br>  Unlighted questions: <br>  - the role of money and the financial system as a whole <br>  - institute of power </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/44597/">https://habr.com/ru/post/44597/</a></p>
