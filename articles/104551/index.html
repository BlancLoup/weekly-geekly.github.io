I will try to correct this situation.  Today was the fourth anniversary of the Moscow School of Management in Skolkovo. <br><br>  Sign up for the event could be <a href="http://www.skolkovo.ru/anniversary/2010/ru/">here</a> . <br><br>  Actually, this event was not particularly different from similar to him in the same Google or Microsoft, which I had to visit.  Everything was decorous, noble and at the level.  In general, I am skeptical about Skolkovo and what passions are happening around him.  After attending the event, my skepticism did not pass, but it came to an understanding of what it really is.  About my thoughts after a small report.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Report </h4><br><br>  At 14.30 - my friends and I boarded a bus at the Slavyansky Boulevard metro station.  He got us pretty fast to our destination.  This item was Disk D. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/813/02a/f35/81302af354dccb08be57e3d2fbf6dd20.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The picture shows the old photo a year ago.  This building is already at the final stage of finishing works.  In fact, it remains to finish the lawns around the building and can be used.  There is ample parking. <br><br>  At the entrance we were given a small program with a floor plan.  Passed things in the wardrobe and went up the escalators to the second floor. <br><br>  Then we realized that without a map we could not do ... The building is roomy and with a very original architecture.  The program was a map, which helped us figure out what's what.  (I apologize for the quality, as scanned ...) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/84a/5b2/506/84a5b25062dace066e693cb1d4e73a2e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  At the same time, nine masterclasses went at once, naturally, I wanted to go straight to everything.  But, nothing can be done, I had to choose one.  List of seminars and speakers <a href="http://www.skolkovo.ru/anniversary/2010/ru/opendoorsprogramme/masterclasses">here</a> . <br><br>  The choice was not easy, but we stopped at the seminar "Innovation: design or technology?" Why?  On the one hand, representatives of Intel in the person of Alexei Nikolaev, on the other Dmitry Repin, who deals with startups for students, on the third Nubar Afeyan is a billionaire, a senior teacher at MIT and just a good person.  I was wondering how a techie.  Other seminars were no less interesting.  As we were told, they will later be posted electronically, if they have not already been posted. <br><br>  At about 15.45 the workshop itself began. <br><br>  The master class was divided into 2 parts.  For an hour each. <br><br>  At the first we were told about the statistics on ideas and start-ups.  There are 300 worth of ideas per 3000 raw ideas.  125 of them reach the project stage, which in turn turn into 9 prototypes.  A large working enterprise reaches 4, of which 1.7 can enter the market and only 1 will be successful. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6c2/e63/5eb/6c2e635ebcb0123a25cfea6801b2985e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  They also showed that it is unknown how and who will relate to new ideas - it is not known whether it will shoot or not.  For example, if we came up with a mechanism that allows you to travel for 5 minutes to the other end of the planet, then how would we like to travel: alone, in a small group or in a group of 100 people, we simply do not know that.  Then they showed about three important components of any startup - this is desire, opportunity and economic expediency.  They told about extreme users - children, old people, people with disabilities (for example, blind people). <br><br>  In the second part, we were offered to try our hand at something like that.  As an example, there were "absurdities" when eating food.  For example, fat fingers in fast food after potatoes and hamburgers, crumbs, big sandwiches that do not climb into your mouth, well, etc.  We put ideas on brainstorming ourselves.  Then we were given standard prototyping packages (they should not work, just symbolize how it should look).  There was colored paper, plasticine, scotch, toothpicks, a sponge, matches, a stapler, sticky sheets, glue, scissors, that is, a standard office, which is in any office.  For 30 minutes we had to come up with a solution to one of the problems and make a small presentation.  Your humble servant came up with a rubberized cap of a special shape for opening especially twisted soda bottles (if you suddenly see this, let me know, be sure to file a lawsuit against them).  There was also edible paper, tricky built-in towels, 4 kinds of smart refrigerators, a fire-resistant bag for cigarettes and much more.  Then there were presentations - in general, it was fun. <br><br>  Then they explained to us that from such a nonsense that we produced during this hour, quite a good solution is being conceived, which goes into further development.  On average, we should try to produce about 20 such ideas per day or to notice 20 ‚Äúabsurdities‚Äù in our daily life.  After some time, sensible thoughts begin to come to mind. <br><br><h4>  Considerations </h4><br><br>  Now, actually my thoughts.  Many of us believe that there should be some kind of technopark or science city in Skolkovo, and there scientists (domestic and not so much) will build the future.  In my opinion, it is not.  In any case, today I did not see such premises there, maybe I did not look well.  But!  It seems to me that Skolkovo, in any case a business school, has a completely different task.  We can invent something (fundamental or not).  We can create something (global or not) based on what we have invented.  But sell (at least somehow) is something we know how bad.  Today I saw that there, in Skolkovo, first of all they were teaching how to properly sell what we created.  For me, this is like an advanced bastion, sorry, consumption with a scientific approach.  Only he is focused on the fact that we could successfully sell our products.  This is potentially a good business school.  I can not judge the results of its work in absentia, because too little time has passed, only 4 years.  Yes, it saddens me that the science in Skolkovo, at this stage, in spite of all the statements, is given little attention, or it is given in a way that is incomprehensible to me.  In this regard, skepticism about Skolkovo is preserved, but an understanding has come of what it really is and what they are trying to do there in the first place.  If to argue from this point of view, so far everything is logical. <br><br>  Well, what will happen next, wait and see, maybe everything is not as bad as it seems ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/104551/">https://habr.com/ru/post/104551/</a></p>
