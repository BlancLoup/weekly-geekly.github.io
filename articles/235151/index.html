The summer is over, but the holiday season is not over yet, ‚Äúvelvet‚Äù September is ahead.  And today we would like to raise such a burning topic as post-holiday depression.  Of course, in a strict, clinical sense, this is not depression at all, but depression.  But still a very unpleasant state, when there is a feeling that all the pleasure of the holidays went down the drain.  Suddenly you ‚Äúremember‚Äù again how much your colleagues annoy you, especially you notice the shortcomings of the office and the workplace, do any tasks strain you, and how do you even work here for so long?  With melancholy, the rest that just ended is remembered, and it already feels like it was not with you.  Or a long time ago.  In general, it does not work at all. <br><br>  For all those whom the postprand blues covered, we have prepared a translation of the <a href="http://blog.airbnb.com/10-ways-to-fight-the-post-holiday-blues/">tips</a> , with the help of which it is much easier to postpone this unpleasant period.  Future "vacationers" will also be useful to get acquainted. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Immediately make a reservation that one thought passes through all the tips with a red thread - in order not to succumb to the blues, you must be proactive.  That is, to act on the lead.  The very first, so to say, zero advice - go back to your usual life gradually, both in work and in family troubles.

      If your vacation is still ahead, we highly recommend: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Do not in any way solve work issues during rest.  And generally drive away any memories and thoughts about work.  Your main task is to completely change the type of activity, including in the head.  Otherwise, you are unlikely to really relax and unwind, on your return you will tell everyone that you have not been on vacation. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Do not plan to do a lot of things during the holidays.  This applies to those who do not go riding, and is going to rake up a bunch of accumulated cases.  It is better not to spend on vacation at all, but if there is no way without that, then take on increased obligations.  Anyway, you will not rest, and to this will be added the feeling of guilt for not done. <br><br>  And if you have recently (or relatively recently) returned, then the following tips will most likely be useful to you. <br><br><h4>  Move more </h4><br> <a href="http://www.airbnb.ru/%3Faf%3D20787839%26c%3Dhabrahabr_post"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e4c/4d4/bc1/e4c4d4bc128b40f5aee475827e31ecdc.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Advice for all occasions.  However, in this case, physical activity - classes in the gym, cycling or roller skating, home exercise, horizontal bar in the yard, even just long walks - is a distracting activity. <br><br>  Concentrating on the performance of certain exercises, on the movement, you will simply not be willing to notice the imperfection of the surrounding world and the people who inhabit it.  We especially recommend taking a few short ‚Äúphysically active‚Äù breaks during the working day.  First, it will distract you from anguish and discontent.  And secondly, you cheer up, and being, as you know, determines consciousness - the improvement of the physiological state directly affects our psychological state. <br><br><h4>  Formulate personal and professional goals </h4><br> <a href="http://www.airbnb.ru/%3Faf%3D20787839%26c%3Dhabrahabr_post"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8b2/745/938/8b27459386b04f68bd13abc22ed3291f.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Our psyche is so arranged that we need to see the results of our labors, our efforts.  It does not necessarily have to be something tangible.  The main thing is to achieve a specific goal, to get a certain result, to achieve something, to achieve it.  Every person subconsciously needs to receive an award in the form of some fruits of their labor, and this is not about money.  That is why not everyone is able to work on the conveyor in the workshop. <br><br>  To get your portion of satisfaction, never set a blurry or unattainable goal.  Like ‚Äúcall parents more often‚Äù, ‚Äúsleep more‚Äù, ‚Äúlose weight‚Äù.  Such formulations are completely ineffective because they do not give a concrete result.  Instead, always try to visualize your goal, present it in detail for yourself as much as possible.  For example, ‚ÄúI can run 8 km without stopping‚Äù, or ‚ÄúI feel awake and sleep in the morning.‚Äù  The specific goal takes the form of a specific result.  And it is nice. <br><br><h4>  Listen to music more often </h4><br> <a href="http://www.airbnb.ru/%3Faf%3D20787839%26c%3Dhabrahabr_post"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b81/45d/841/b8145d841a2c48738e040e40fe63d0cf.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Another very effective and harmless way to distract and cheer up.  Actually, there is nothing to comment on.  The main thing is not to put yourself in the playlist dark and dreary compositions, they are unlikely to cheer you up. <br><br><h4>  Arrange cleaning </h4><br> <a href="http://www.airbnb.ru/%3Faf%3D20787839%26c%3Dhabrahabr_post"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/41d/f87/e8f/41df87e8fcae4e80b4012917749718f2.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Returning from vacation, we find ourselves in an old and familiar world.  The same apartment, the same workplace.  And here the associative mechanism works, pulling negative memories and emotions that are somehow connected with these places to the surface.  Therefore, a serious cleaning at home and in the workplace breaks this subconscious interconnection, which spoils us all the pleasure on returning from vacation. <br><br><h4>  Clean contact lists in social networks </h4><br> <a href="http://www.airbnb.ru/%3Faf%3D20787839%26c%3Dhabrahabr_post"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ddf/279/0e0/ddf2790e05f64b4ba7f0ec66f4a61fac.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Also a kind of cleaning.  The vast majority of us have contact lists filled with people who are not interested in us.  More precisely, on which we do not care if you call a spade a spade.  They can give us nothing we need.  And there is nothing shameful or indecent to invite them to say goodbye.  Softly, of course.  Getting rid of all these unnecessary, unnecessary connections brings present relief.  By the way, this is a great excuse to spend the first working day after a holiday on Facebook or Vkontakte: "I optimize the rate of return on investment in my <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25BE%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2584">social graph</a> ." <br><br><h4>  Plan your entertainment </h4><br> <a href="http://www.airbnb.ru/%3Faf%3D20787839%26c%3Dhabrahabr_post"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/95a/10d/8e4/95a10d8e4ba648a38fc5acabeb119a04.jpg"></a> <br><br>  How do you usually spend your evenings after work?  Watching the series, going to well-known cafes and bars, because it has long become a habit?  As we mentioned above, the return to the familiar environment often acts as depressing.  And the old, perfected to perfection entertainment no longer brings satisfaction.  So spend some time on the first working day and plan something new for the evening, unusual for you.  It is not necessary to plunge into a familiar quagmire. <br><br><h4>  Engage in a socially significant matter </h4><br> <a href="http://www.airbnb.ru/%3Faf%3D20787839%26c%3Dhabrahabr_post"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d7c/667/186/d7c66718641b40c6b856097f220925d2.jpg"></a> <br><br>  It can be anything.  Choose for yourself something where your hands, brains, time or money can come in handy.  No matter how trite it may sound, but selfless help to people brings inner satisfaction.  Try it, you will like it.  Not to mention the fact that this is another way to escape from longing for the last vacation. <br><br><h4>  Start planning your next vacation! </h4><br> <a href="http://www.airbnb.ru/%3Faf%3D20787839%26c%3Dhabrahabr_post"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/399/96c/6e8/39996c6e8c764fd0be204498033d9594.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Why not?  Yes, you just returned, but why should this prevent me from dreaming and making plans ?!  Immersed in the choice of location and planning for future rest, you will be much easier to adapt to the harsh weekdays.  It is generally one of the most effective ways not to sink into the blues on returning from the airport or from the station.  To heighten the effect, you can even start saving money, at least a hundred rubles, the fact itself is important.  Anticipation of the future trip will help to brighten more than one day.  So spit on logic, common sense and other people's opinions, and immerse yourself in exploring the countries and cities where you would like to go. <br>  And we will help in finding housing.  As they say, please contact. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/235151/">https://habr.com/ru/post/235151/</a></p>
