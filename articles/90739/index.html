  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Analysis of the design and structure of the site "Is everything okay in the Danish kingdom?"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Creating websites, it is not always possible to see them through the eyes of ordinary users.  As an option to study the user's behavior on the site, and the emotional component of being on the site, an attempt was made to ‚Äúorder‚Äù the study of journalism usability. <br>  The result of this "study" is given to the public. <br>  Very interested in comments (tips) - what criteria are important for site evaluation by a ‚Äúsimple user‚Äù. <br>  Ordering a comprehensive website audit by professionals is a good thing, but not always possible.  Organization of testing for a focus group is an interesting option, but where to find this focus group and how to interest? <br>  Subjective and paid person opinion about the site: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="http://vishneviysad.ru/images/vsad_main_250_.jpg" hspace="10" align="right">  The first impression from the site of the clinic "Cherry Orchard" ( <a href="http://vishneviysad.ru/">http://vishneviysad.ru/</a> ) is finally a quality-made website-page of the organization, and not just another cheap advertising craft.  This at least forces the user not to automatically close the page and look further, but to linger and look.  And with attention ergonomics, everything is in order here: the visitor‚Äôs glance, sliding along the preserved beauty of health slogan at the top of the page, quickly descends to the large (but not cumbersome due to light colors) logo and the name of the clinic, and descends to the list of doctors by the gradient.  This list is decorated very nicely, the photos of the doctors are cheerful, the faces smiling, the very quality of the photos is very good - all this appeals to the visitor for trust and sympathy.  Therefore, when the user opens one of the clinic services listed below, the attitude towards them will already be obviously benevolent. <br>  According to the list there are only two small ‚Äúcosmetic‚Äù remarks: it would be good to loop him so as not to twist long before the first doctor, when I reached the last one and wanted to re-read the information previously offered.  Also, in my opinion, the scroll buttons can be made more visible, so that the visitor can immediately see that this is not a static die, and it can be twisted. <br><img src="http://vishneviysad.ru/images/vsad_spec_250.jpg" hspace="10" align="left">  If we talk about the layout of the standard page of services, then it is also well thought out.  First, they are all made in the same style, which increases the memorability of the logo located on each page in two places (top of the left menu and basement).  Secondly, the contact phone is also present on each page, which will allow the user, as soon as he decides to become your customer, immediately call and become one. <br>  I would especially like to note the design of the site as a whole: the background of all pages is white, it not only does not strain or distract attention, but also simplifies the perception of other graphic elements of the site, and also, most importantly, the content itself.  The site has four colors (white, red, blue and black), and all of them are tied to certain types of information (active / non-active menu, titles, text), which makes it easier for the user to navigate.  After reviewing a couple of pages of the site, it is immediately obvious how to find any information of interest.  The search field is unobtrusively located in the upper right corner, and the fact that it already contains one of the special medical terms used on the site makes it an additional entry point. <br>  So, the client, having made sure of the solidity and quality of the services of the clinic, decided to use its services, and went to the page with contact information.  And on this page, in my opinion, he has every reason to make sure that he made the right choice: a convenient location map, VCard, sending an address to a mobile and even barcode - such an abundance of high-tech means of obtaining contact information can be found only on most advanced sites.  The visitor has the impression that since the clinic did not stint on the creation of such a site, then they have a solid income, which certainly inspires confidence. <br></div>
