  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to reduce piracy and satisfy honest psp user</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h4>  What is the article about </h4><br>  Everyone knows that the level of piracy rolls over not only in our country, but throughout the world.  I'm not going to argue about the nature of piracy - I will show a real example when a company is able to reduce the level of piracy to the lowest possible threshold, benefiting the end users of its product.  Yes, I'm talking about Sony and its PSP line. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Historical Preamble </h4><br><br>  So, briefly describe the situation that has now developed.  Before the PSP 2000 (with rare reservations for certain motherboards of the latter), when there was actually only one model of the console, popularly known as "fat" and "fatty", the craftsmen managed to flash it.  I will not talk about the technology of the firmware, because not for the article, but just to say that it is because of its firmware patch and psp 2000 on one single board are still popular with the people.  They have not been produced for a long time, but buying a used one is not a problem. <br>  What makes the firmware possible?  It is logical to flash on the unofficial firmware, which in fact are official pokovyryannymi.  So, custom firmwares, firstly, make it possible to run unsigned sony applications and, as a bonus, some extras.  features (such as replacing xmb themes with well-customizable cxmb, installing other plugins).  Separately, it is worth highlighting the possibility of controlling the frequency of the processor, which allows you to increase the psp time when using applications that are not too demanding (browser, audio player, reader, etc.). <br>  For some time, PSP&gt; = 1000 were considered unbreakable and ... so far they are, but later it became possible to patch the RAM through a vulnerability in libtiff, and, as a result, it was possible to launch homebushies, and since ‚Äúeveryone needs‚Äù, soon there were work in hen mode.  So, PSP &lt;= 3000, supplied with firmware &lt;= 5.03, can effortlessly, until the battery is completely turned off, according to the possibilities of ‚Äúnot giving in‚Äù to their ancestors. <br>  Sony, of course, immediately began to close holes (rather perverted method, instead of patchtiya libtiff - a simple ban on tiff images in the built-in viewer).  Subsequently, the emerging opportunities are also instantly closed in the following firmware. <br>  There is nothing for owners of firmware 5.03, but Sony, which is quite logical, blocks access to PSN and other amenities for owners of old firmware.  New games start to come up with a built-in check for lice (stupid substitution of the firmware version for another one already doesn‚Äôt roll), and we end up with pretty products - patches that patch the game on the go and various psnfuckers that (!) Allow use PSN and PS-store.  The conciliator, the last is nonsense, the person must pay for her to pay for sony. <br>  Later, psp go appears, which initially has firmware 6.2. <br>  And now, when homebrew is already able to run at 6.2 (hello hole in patapone), sony releases 6.3, one of the main features of which is a closed (probably through a hundred crutches) hole. <br>  The bottom line is that you cannot run homebrew on the latest firmware, and as soon as the opportunity arises, sony will release 6.4.

    <h4>  We divide users </h4><br>  So, let's divide the PSP users into two global categories: those who are willing to pay and those who will not pay when. <br>  The latter are quite interesting characters.  They buy only consoles that can be ‚Äúpoked‚Äù, games - download in iso and, in general, except for the prefix itself, they don‚Äôt pay for anything else and don‚Äôt collect them.  If this character accidentally bought a ‚Äúnon-firmware‚Äù, then (most likely) he will say goodbye to her (sell, etc ...) or go to group number 1. <br>  Those who are willing to pay can be divided into those who will always pay and those who will pay only if what he pays for, he liked so much that he is ready to give his money, otherwise - ‚Äúwell, I passed this game is not interesting, I will not buy idiot chtoli? ". <br>  But still it is necessary to recognize that these two subgroups bring sony profit.  The latter brings less, but brings. <br><br><h4>  And now the fun begins </h4><br>  People are used to the fact that psp is not only a platform for games.  This is a great portable computer: audio / video players, book readers, emulators, ported (tss, openttd and supertux, last-twice) and games written by enthusiasts - this is what psp can give, but only gives users ‚Äúcustom‚Äù firmware. <br>  Yes, sony slowly begins to move in the direction of the software, but so slowly ... <br><br><h4>  My situation </h4><br>  So, how can I not tell you about myself. <br>  I play only purchased games.  Occasionally I put "iso" on the downloaded iso downloaded (at the same time, if I don‚Äôt like the game - I don‚Äôt play, I like it - I buy it).  As you already understood from me 5.03.  I constantly want to go to the office.  firmware, but it stops me from losing the opportunity to use excellent free software: bookr and pmplayer and the same free games - openttd is just great.  Plus, I will lose the opportunity to write applications in Ruby (yes, there is already an interpreter of this excellent language) under my psp. <br><br><h4>  general review </h4><br>  So let's select for a group that is willing to pay, facts about the firmware. <br><br><h5>  Custom </h5><br>  + Homebrew <br>  + Interface customization <br>  + Plugins (like parallel music listening) <br>  - Trouble with the launch of games that require firmware with a larger version. <br>  - The impossibility of full use of PSN, PS-Store <br><br>  Invert method. <br><h5>  Official </h5><br>  + Ability to run the latest purchased games <br>  + No problems with PSN and PS-Store <br>  - There is no possibility of launching unsigned applications, as a result - the inability to use the mass of homebrew that is completely legal in its functions <br><br>  Plug-ins and customization are more like custom firmware firmwares, so I don‚Äôt consider them to be a minus. <br><br><h4>  What would the user want </h4><br>  I would like to be able to use third-party software and the opportunity to try any game.  If the latter is solved and sony is already moving in this direction, introducing the sale of games for a certain time and adding demo-games to the store, then the first one should be discussed in more detail. <br><br><h4>  Sony AppStore </h4><br>  It is understandable why sony prohibits the launch of unsigned applications.  If it seems to you that launching simple homebrew doesn‚Äôt do anything bad, then remember that it‚Äôs after the launch of homebrew‚Äôs launch that it‚Äôs possible to launch spiral images of games that can afford sony. <br>  Actually, I will offer my version of the organization of the legal use of homebrew. <br><br>  So, the first is the creation of a sandbox system, within which third-party applications will be launched.  Restrictions can be introduced inside sandboxes, such as ‚Äúapplication weight is not more than N megabytes‚Äù <br>  The second is the creation of a store in which authors will download the application, and users will download them.  On the side of the sony store will sign applications, in the end - inside the sandbox can be run only approved sony applications. <br>  As a barrier to hundreds of unnecessary applications - you can enter a registration fee as a seller (software supplier).  For example, I am ready to give the author pmplayer $ 50 to register in the store.  In the end, an existing community will skip a cent and be able to add favorite software. <br>  Of course, the AppStore can become a platform not only for opensource applications, but also for commercial software (hello, Apple‚Äôs store and Google‚Äôs market). <br><br><h4>  Development kit </h4><br>  And now about the sad.  What the homebrew developers are currently using is not official dev.kit, everything is obtained by reverse engineering. <br>  Sony also sells its own set of developer for some large (for simple developers) money. <br>  Of course, sony will not allow vyklydyvat software, not made according to their guidelines and rules, in the end - in order to currently existing applications appeared in the desired store, it will be necessary to significantly rework them and ... somehow get a development kit. <br>  I think Sony doesn‚Äôt get much money from the sale of the latter, so it‚Äôs quite possible to provide a set to a person after registering him as a supplier. <br><br><h4>  What will be the result </h4><br>  In the end, everyone will be happy, a panacea is found.  People who pay always go on off.  firmware and do not lose functionality, some of those who "pay for the masterpieces" - go on off.  firmware, and those who do not pay ... well, they did not bring and will not bring sony money, no matter how you restrict it. <br><br>  <b><i>what a pity that hardly dreams of the store will be realized and so on and you will have to buy umd and hack the prefix ... <s>poster</s></i></b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/98399/">https://habr.com/ru/post/98399/</a></p>
