  <section class="page js-page"><h1>LG Optimus VU: aspect ratio matters</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today, LG has introduced two new devices, which will soon be sold in the Russian Federation.  The first is the L9 smartphone.  However, I was much more interested in the second device: LG Optimus VU.  I noticed this device back in February of this year, when it was presented at the MWC in Barcelona.  Now this LG response to the Samsung Galaxy Note will be sold here as well.  Cost, however, it will be 25 thousand rubles.  However, this does not make the device less interesting. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e1f/69b/696/e1f69b69675d35ac6458a99666f6b2ac.jpg" alt="image">

      In contrast to the elongated Galaxy Note, VU is almost square: with a 5-inch diagonal, the aspect ratio is 4: 3.  LG considered that it is this aspect ratio that is closest to the book and most convenient for the consumption of media content.  In this regard, by the way, I recall the recent presentation of Apple, whose iPad mini, although it does not repeat the classic aspect ratio, is clearly committed to this.  However, the large iPad is closer to this concept, so of course there‚Äôs no need to talk about any kind of borrowing.  VU is really completely independent device and very interesting at the same time.  For a user, such an aspect ratio will result, for example, in the fact that the device will be conveniently held in hands during vertical scanning and typing with two hands on the keyboard.  On the Galaxy Note, in spite of its dimensions, it is still more convenient to type the text with horizontal scanning, although it is also possible to adjust to the vertical one. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f2e/2a4/c15/f2e2a4c15248dfe5ac8d49c9c215532d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Like the Galaxy Note, Optimus VU has a 3G module and telephone functionality, that is, it can be not only the second, but also the only user device.  It is based on a 4-core processor NVIDIA Tegra 3, the space which provides 1 GB of RAM.  The amount of built-in flash memory 32 GB.  But the connector for a removable SD card is not here.  The battery has a capacity of 2080 mAh, which, in theory, should be enough for a working day.  However, this is only a speculative conclusion.  Two cameras, the main 8 megapixel, shooting video in Full HD and front 1.3 megapixel for video telephony. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c7a/6bf/945/c7a6bf945a2622348bc9b95d2cbf3aee.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Another unique element is the touch key to call the manager of running applications.  Usually in android devices, this function is implemented by holding your finger on the Home key.  Here (possibly because of the available width) a separate key is reserved for this.  It seems that it will make work on VU much faster and more comfortable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/96e/470/955/96e470955ba14239065cbf6d8ccc7b71.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  More about the keys and buttons.  Very pleased at the upper end of the blind, covering the micro-USB connector for charging and connecting to a computer.  There is also an on / off button, it is also a button to lock and unlock the display.  The volume buttons are on the right side.  However, there is another button on the upper side that activates the proprietary interface developed by LG specifically for Optimus VU.  You can more or less see it on my video, which I shot in February at the Barcelona Mobile Congress.  However, it is possible that since then this interface and functionality have undergone changes. <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/szkiDdvyO1o%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgO4hrzSqV9wSHu3dFDWqAGuH8DWQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  At first glance, a potential buyer may be doubted by the resolution of the display, in which the VU clearly loses the Galaxy Note.  Here it is 1024x768.  However, you should not forget that the diagonal in VU is 5 inches, and in iPad mini with the same resolution the diagonal is 7.9 inches.  So, the new Apple from this parameter loses Optimus VU.  However, if the quality of the display could be assessed only by resolution figures, everything would be much simpler.  Even the fact that this IPS-matrix, in fact, means little.  How the display behaves in the sun, how it reacts to the lighting, guided by the commands of the sensor, are all questions that can be answered only with direct testing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ff3/1cc/ffa/ff31ccffa36b80b0db14d4243c151cc6.jpg" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/157041/">https://habr.com/ru/post/157041/</a></p>
