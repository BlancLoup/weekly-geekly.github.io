      Now we‚Äôll focus on the basic recommendations on the criteria of an ideal affiliate program with specific examples; if you open your affiliate program, think carefully about these questions, which relate primarily to the convenience of your adverts, and not to your office work or the inner kitchen, since all your money is without care Final adverts are simply zero-efficiency engine that causes you indirect damages. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Convenience of registration (confirmation of account, its verification, etc.)</b> <br><br>  If you see a scammer in each advert, require him to send a scan of your passport, other documents, fingerprints, people who have high incomes will pass your affiliate program, you should remember that you are not a bank or a payment system or tax police that require documents for laundering their funds through adverts.  (if you need documents or forms for tax purposes, please sign a full-fledged paper contract with an advert in writing and send him a copy by fax) <br><br>  Verification of partner accounts is quite true to stretch to the first payments with a delay, during this time you can check all the requirements for the partner, analyze his activity, but at the moment, save you not to fix the statistics of the partner‚Äôs work, if the partner sends you traffic, keep statistics on him , at least at the lowest available level, but which is paid so that the person does not give up working with you, seeing solid zeros in the results of his initial activity. <br><br>  <b>Convenience of the zone for users (presence of news from the affiliate company, ssl zone of adverts, indication of various data in the profile, load on the interface of registration)</b> <br><br>  Your advert will not climb on a heap of your and third-party forums in the hope of finding news of your affiliate program in the ‚Äúspam, advertising, affiliate news‚Äù sections, and you shouldn‚Äôt force them to read these forums, and moreover register separately in them in a completely bad tone.  The zone for adverts where the advert is authorized is ideal for publishing news and changes in your affiliate program. <br><br>  You pay the partner money, therefore, be kind enough to take care of its security, use the ssl protected zone of adverts with a valid and legal ssl certificate (and not created on the knee), and you will see that the advert will trust you more than your partner‚Äôs profile. you do not collect statistics for marketing research on the topic, how many years the partner has, his / her marital, social status and  . <br><br>  You should not overload the zone of adverts with an abundance of flash animations and other decorations that are not related to the activities of the advert, a simple interface that provides the necessary data is an ideal solution, because people will often visit your zone of adverts (unless of course they do not use statsremote) to be pleasant and not annoy the intense brain of the advert.  (This blog is not an ideal affiliate, so it can afford such a color scheme) <br><br>  Any item in the zone of adverts should not open further than three clicks in the interface menu. <br><br>  <b>Payments (balance, hold, periods, payment methods, type of payments, cash flow, earnings)</b> <br><br>  The first thing that an advert cares about is his earnings and the size of the next payout (if there are temporary lines), so make sure that the balance of the advert profile is always available to him without any extra mouse clicks on a bunch of menu items. <br><br>  In a good way, if the funds of the adverts have a feature to accumulate, set the size of the first payment is not exorbitant value, not the number of average earnings of your adverts, but the minimum amount, the transfer of which pays for its delivery to the adverts.  Do not disdain to pay small sums, pay sums for which financial expenses are justified, and you will see that the advert will be glad that his money does not get stuck anywhere, but is paid in the amount earned by him, even if it is minimal. <br><br>  In the period of work of the adverts with the affiliate program there may be periods when the advert has a difficult situation with the supply of traffic or customers, but if at the moment the affiliate program delays payments due to underdialing the minimum activity requirements for current sales, etc., without paying out the earned money that satisfies Requirements of the minimum payment will result in the advert simply forgetting about your affiliate program. <br><br>  A good reason to remind the adverts of the affiliate program, if its activity has fallen, is to make all the planned payments on time, be sure to indicate the name of the affiliate program in the payment details so that the partner does not wonder where the earned money came from. <br><br>  Also it is necessary to send a message to the adverb about the offer of additional assistance to improve its activity with professional recommendations for working with an affiliate program. <br><br>  <b>Statistics (reports, the result of the work of the adverts, auxiliary tools)</b> <br><br>  The partner should be provided with complete statistics and reporting of his work, as detailed as possible by dates and periods, possibly even with schedules of growth of his activity and income. <br>  It is also desirable to provide an XML version of the statistics, which the partner can either independently or with the help of special programs receive and analyze. <br><br>  I do not give more detailed recommendations on this issue, since the activity statistics of each affiliate program is different, and depends on the methods and methods of its work as with the services it presents, also with adverts. <br><br>  <b>Advert support (accessibility forms, tickets, responsiveness and responsiveness)</b> <br><br>  A support that is only available by email is an outdated concept, tickets will save the world, but if only by email, then respond to emails from adverts as quickly as possible, 21st century is on the nose, so do not hesitate to IM with instant messengers, chat rooms (like liveperson) and a multi-channel number a phone call, in case of emergency, an advert can call you, even if it listens to music for 1 minute before it hits the operator, 1 minute is ideal, the response time of the phone support is more than one minute - it will annoy the advert that you  Onita. <br><br>  If the question that needs to be resolved, take some time is quite substantial, you should definitely provide the Advert with information about how its request is processed and what current status it has, so that the advert is not under the painful expectation that no one hears it and its letter got into a black hole , from which he will not get an answer, but fortunately most of the modern ticketing systems cope with this task with a bang. <br><br>  Unfortunately, we understand that this is not a complete reference guide for affiliate programs, but we hope that they will help the more favorable work of affiliate programs with adverts even minimally, since even the minimum result is a positive result. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.na2co3.net/index.php/2007/01/07/idealnaya-partnerskaya-programma/">the source ...</a> <br><br>  ¬© na2co3.net </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/3588/">https://habr.com/ru/post/3588/</a></p>
