  <section class="page js-page"><h1>A little about us</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Algorithm development is a new area of ‚Äã‚Äãexpertise.  This profession originated at the intersection of science and business.  The work of the ‚Äúalgorithm developer‚Äù is to apply scientific methods to solve one or another non-standard applied problem. <br><br>  ‚ÄúNon-standard‚Äù is the key word here, since the solutions of standard problems are described in textbooks, and to solve them it is enough to have a specialized education.  However, in modern society, a whole industry of ‚Äútechnological start-ups‚Äù has emerged - firms that are being created to develop new technological trends, which then, in the case of successful completion of development, are usually sold for big money to large corporations.  And these companies require people who are able to find solutions to non-standard applied problems. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It so happened that the solution of applied problems in various scientific and applied fields: chemistry, biology, geography, physics, economics, medicine, astronautics, etc.  Today is tied to the creation of intelligent software.  These programs work on computers, electronic circuits, and other hybrid devices of varying degrees of complexity.  And if this software copes well with its work, then the initial applied and theoretical problems are successfully solved.  Therefore, the topic of ‚Äúalgorithms‚Äù united in itself, as under an umbrella, problem solving from various branches of knowledge. <br><br>  Many books are written about what methods can be used in solving certain problems.  However, very little information is available on how to approach the solution of complex problems in general.

      For many years I was interested in this question.  I started to solve complex problems from school, then years of scientific work followed, and for the last ten years I have been engaged in applied commercial scientific research in various fields.  All this time I tried to notice the ways in which people come to find truly non-trivial, strong, innovative solutions. <br><br>  The search for the answer led me to the study of human psychology and ways of thinking, I went to several serious seminars on psychology.  My attitude to solving complex problems has also changed dramatically over the years. <br><br>  Several years ago, I realized that I could combine my separate observations into a single methodology.  I did this, and then began to check it on all the tasks I encountered in my work.  In recent years, I have tested this technique on many projects, and I see that it works very well.  It turned out that the number of successfully solved problems, as well as the speed of their solution, increased many times. <br><br>  At the same time, I reduced the unnecessary elements, and as a result the plan for solving the problem, which I am guided by, turned out to be quite simple and short.  Someone, perhaps, such simplicity will repel, as he or she will think that such simple and obvious strategies cannot; obvious strategies will lead to the solution of really complex problems.  However, this is the case.  It requires only some experience in their use in order to get results in a variety of scientific fields - both theoretical and applied. <br><br>  <i>(To be continued, if there is interest)</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/67468/">https://habr.com/ru/post/67468/</a></p>
