Choosing a form</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/02/t4/gx/02t4gxjf1uaslikbvglo4gpbfra.jpeg" alt="image" align="right">  So, you are going to find a new job.  Where to begin?  With the search for a suitable vacancy that best reflects your wishes for a new position and organization.  And then ... Then begins a frantic search for a template that would fit all the best that you could tell about yourself.  And here the first difficulties arise.  There are many forms of resumes, but you have a favorite one.  What to choose? <br><br>  Of course, it is easier to pick up and fill in some ready-made questionnaire form on one of the employment sites, or copy the accounting sheet, which may be stored in your organization in the personnel department.  And can use the resume composing designer from one of the sites of the finished resume?  The choice is ambiguous. <br><br>  Resume is your business card.  It should be as attractive as possible to those who will watch it.  The person who makes the selection should have an unconscious desire to necessarily invite you for an interview. <a name="habracut"></a>

      Now we come to the most important thing.  Do you know that each person is unique and inimitable not only by his fingerprints, type of thinking, way of presenting his thoughts, manner of presenting himself to strangers?  Of course you know!  Therefore, you should guess that you express your individuality to one degree or another in almost everything: in the clothes you wear, in the way you present yourself at the interview, in speech and in emotions.  In the summary, we also express our unique style.  We would like to demonstrate all the best, interesting and, most importantly, necessary to a potential employer.  And what should not be mentioned - of course, hide! <br><br><h3>  Resume - this is a matter that, as a rule, do not want to do </h3><br>  In my opinion, many people agree with this statement who, due to certain circumstances, had to draw up this unfortunate document.  The person is so arranged that he doesn‚Äôt really like to go through various castings, especially if this occupation is forced.  So it turns out that most often we are looking for work, because something in it does not suit us.  And as soon as you have a need for job search, there is a need to find some kind of resume template that, from your point of view, would be the most appropriate. <br><br>  Yes, there is another indisputable truth - in every person there is something good and something that he may not like very much in himself.  And this is only part of the problem.  And if you have something that does not suit your employer?  Imagine the following picture: you find an interesting vacancy for yourself, send a resume to this organization, and for some reason you are simply excluded by you, even without letting you pass the interview.  Annoying, right? <blockquote>  Conversation in the personnel department: <br>  - We reviewed your resume and, you know, somehow were not impressed ... <br>  - And I saw your sharagu and, you know, also somehow not Gazprom </blockquote>  Everyone who is engaged in staff recruitment subconsciously evaluates resumes by several parameters.  I already wrote about this in the last article.  The system I mentioned is based on an assessment of the three main indicators subconsciously estimated by a person - form, content and font. <br><br>  Some of you will think that this rating system is not worth considering.  Since it is not described and is not known to anyone.  In something you are right, but in something not.  After all, processes that we do not realize are sometimes even stronger than those that we consciously control.  Therefore, to consider this or not, you decide. <br><br>  And for those who are interested, I will start with the first of the resume evaluation factors - with the form in which the potential employee places information about himself.  It is important that it is because of the form you choose that your resume will either fall into a pile of documents, to call with an invitation for an interview (it will not be thrown into the dropout folder), or almost immediately you will be mentally labeled "not very suitable."  And perhaps they will not consider it at all. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/y8/up/b8/y8upb83y29njdkq6eonqnp6yaxi.jpeg" alt="image" align="right"><br><br>  Recruiters on job sites give advice on focusing on a resume on completeness of information, no errors, the suitability of education, and the experience of your chosen job.  All this is also important and no one will argue that it is not significant.  But this is the content. <br><br>  You might be surprised, but each person, when confronted with a new document drawn up in an arbitrary form, first of all evaluates unconsciously precisely the form and font.  That is why now I started not with the content, but with the form. <br><br><h3>  Meet on clothes, and escorted by the mind </h3><br>  So, the resume is your clothes, which are seen by the employees of the enterprise of the applicant to which you send him.  And in order that the clothes will not let you down, let's look at a few resumes of IT specialists. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Summary ‚Ññ1</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yv/rj/xt/yvrjxtpwbwlc4zbmurqmnww02ns.jpeg" alt="image"></div></div><br>  How do you like it?  And here is another characteristic summary. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Summary number 2</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bc/rc/qz/bcrcqzm8jh3tf91pfaeqxtri8pm.jpeg" alt="image"></div></div><br>  You say that it is the same form?  And you will be wrong.  But more about that later. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Summary number 3</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/a8/ub/ol/a8uboly-uunohht_3v0hnluqz1o.jpeg" alt="image"></div></div><br>  And now the question is - which of these three candidates would you be asked for in an interview if you had the task to pick an employee?  Perhaps all three, and perhaps no one.  I hear your exclamations about the fact that here the form of a resume, because we are interested in what exactly the applicant can do? <br><br>  And now let's go through the information that each of the applicants subconsciously gives us, according to the form he chooses. <br><br><h3>  Summary 1 </h3><br>  This document gives us a person who chooses a small company, a person up to 100, "family" type.  I would like him to be accepted into this family and treated him with understanding.  He is not professionally defined, but he would like to have a profession in which few office workers understand.  Thus, he can do the work as he pleases, no one can determine the quality of the work done.  The main thing is that in the process of work he could, without leaving the office, go about his business.  It is important to create the impression that you are doing something, the appearance of the working process. It is desirable that he has one leader, and this should be the head of the organization, who also does not need to understand what this employee does, but who trusts him. <br><br>  According to the selected resume form, it is also possible to say with confidence that this is an ordinary specialist who will try to occupy a privileged position in the company.  But, the main thing is that he will not be a good IT specialist, he will be just a consultant who gives advice, but does not do anything himself.  He will tell you and show you what you must do in order for the system to work.  But he will be reluctant to carry out specific works.  Will delay the time, or seek help from organizations that under the contract will perform his direct work. <br><br>  Most likely it will become loyal to the head of the organization.  But the rest of the employees, he will make it clear that he does not work for them.  The work of employees, or the needs that arise in the process of doing the work, are not at all interesting for him. <br><br>  Yes, this information can be understood if you know the resume analysis system I wrote about in the previous article.  But also this information is read by us subconsciously.  Therefore, I think that when you read the resume of the first candidate, you subconsciously experienced some discomfort, which, most likely, were driven away from you, believing that this was not important. <br><br>  And if this resume comes to you in a stack of similar ones, most likely you will set it aside in order to call another candidate for an interview. <br><br><h3>  Summary 2 </h3><br>  The compiler of this document is independent, knows what he wants.  Chooses a job, not an organization.  He is interested in what he does.  It is easy to agree with him.  Stars from the sky is not enough.  It is more important for him to carry out the work assigned to him.  It can work both in large and small companies.  You can rely on it. <br><br>  As a rule, people choosing this resume form are loyal to the cause in which they are engaged.  Consistent in their actions.  Does not try to create the appearance of work.  After giving him the job, you can be sure that he will try to fulfill them as soon as possible.  Also, he will develop himself because being a professional in his field is simply a necessity for him. <br><br>  You must admit that this worker is more interesting and wants to talk with him, even if he is still young and he doesn‚Äôt have much experience. <br><br><h3>  Summary 3 </h3><br>  The summary of this employee is very detailed and at first glance it seems that this is a super employee with a lot of experience.  But, oddly enough, I do not want to call this person for an interview.  If my conclusion is close to you, I will answer your question - what subconsciously pushes away anyone who has watched his presentation about himself. <br><br>  The form of this resume gives us a person who really wants to have a privileged position in a large western company.  He has big complaints about the company and the people with whom he will work.  At the same time, he absolutely does not see his mistakes and flaws.  After all, the main thing is his environment, it must correspond to his person. <br><br>  By professional orientation, he is not an IT worker.  But at the same time he considers himself the most important and necessary on any place that he liked.  He is poorly trained, but knows how to cause others to pity and a desire to help him.  Often ascribes other people's services to himself.  It creates nervousness and conflicts by one‚Äôs presence among those who interact with it. <br><br>  It looks like a cuckoo chick, who pushes everyone who is in it from any nest.  He believes that he has a huge potential and his ideas are something unique that must be introduced into the practice of work. <br><br>  Agree, a very controversial character.  Is it worth the risk of inviting him for an interview - to judge you.  But it must be remembered that such candidates are able to ‚Äúmimic‚Äù for those on whom their future depends and the interview they, as a rule, pass simply brilliantly. <blockquote>  Urgently required an experienced hacker!  - Resume to leave on the desktop of our server. </blockquote><br><h3>  What is the result? </h3><br>  All three applicants chose different forms of resume, thus made not very positive advertising.  So, in the first resume, the applicant chose a form that graduates of higher educational institutions usually fill out, and in the third, marketers, lawyers, advertisers, but not IT specialists. <br><br>  If one of our applicants simply printed out a questionnaire from any of the sites for employment, it would mean that they were not used to looking for work on their own.  There should always be someone who will recommend them, agree with a potential employer and insure.  This employee is more important - social guarantees, clear rules, the ability to move up the career ladder, but the most important thing is not to be fired according to the personal desire of the head of the organization.  We can say that this is the most unadapted type of workers. <br><br>  If we had an employee's personal card (form T-2) from the personal file stored in the personnel of the enterprise, this would also not be the most positive moment.  The reaction to such a document instead of a resume is usually negative, since subconsciously the person who views it understands that he is a person with a predisposition to work in law enforcement agencies.  Competent specialists can also work in such structures.  However, in this case, I meant that in most cases, ‚ÄúIT specialists‚Äù are unlikely to use the employee‚Äôs personal card as a resume. <br><br>  To listen to what I have written here or not is up to you.  And for those who are going to look for work, I sincerely wish to approach this issue consciously and subconsciously to make the necessary impression on potential employers. <br><br>  Good luck! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/354696/">https://habr.com/ru/post/354696/</a></p>
