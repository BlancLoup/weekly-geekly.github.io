Well, if we can easily determine the ‚Äúfast‚Äù parameter, having handed over the broken equipment for repair, then there are certain problems with the ‚Äúsave‚Äù and ‚Äúhigh-quality‚Äù parameters, because workshops, and sometimes ‚Äúworkshops,‚Äù fight money for elementary work.  Yes, and quickly not always work out.  In this article I want to share my experience, like having a broken TV, 10 rubles, a soldering iron, straight arms and minimal knowledge of electrical engineering, you can regain the zomboyaschik over 9000 in just 1 hour, without resorting to the services of a master.  This article is about the fact that you don‚Äôt need to repair what you can repair yourself faster, cheaper and more qualitatively, possessing only minimal basic knowledge.  And at the same time, not only the male gender is capable of it.  And you can borrow the missing tools from a neighbor.  And this story is an example. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Problem </h4><br>  Some time ago, the PHILIPS LCD TV began to lose ground, starting to turn on more and more slowly, then the blue color disappeared, and then stopped turning on completely, just winking merrily with a LED.  In the end, my bride got it (I don‚Äôt watch TV, and even was glad that there was no unnecessary background now), I burk something like a ‚Äúkondesator khan‚Äù and picked up a screwdriver. <br><br>  My suspicions were the following: one or several condensers somewhere on the power board stopped working adequately.

      Purpose: to find and replace, without resorting to the services of a master.  Well, let's go. <br><br><h4>  "An autopsy revealed that the patient died from an autopsy." </h4><br>  We will need: <br>  - inspection showed that you need a screwdriver or a bit "asterisk". <br>  - soldering iron with a soldering set <br>  - 10 rubles <br>  - straight arms and attentive gaze. <br><br>  Carefully disassemble.  Who knows how everything is fixed there, God forbid, something to tear off.  Personally, I prefer to disassemble everything on the floor, guided by one principle: ‚Äúit will not fall below the floor‚Äù.  That is, the chance of losing something from the ‚Äúdesktop‚Äù is minimal.  All self-tapping screws, screws and grooves it is vital to put in some kind of a lid, so as not to scatter.  Remove the cover and carefully inspect the insides.  First of all, pay attention to the power board.  It is easy to determine by the fact that the power cord is suitable for it, and also by the abundance of all kinds of coils: <br><br><img src="http://clip2net.com/clip/m0/1333290280-clip-129kb.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  We see three swollen capacitors.  There are only two of them in the photo, since I have already dropped out one, cut it and showed it to my beloved, in order to satisfy her interest in the device, and only then took up the camera.  Here they are the heroes of the occasion.  In parallel, we inspect the rest of the board for the presence of damaged elements - everything seems to be clean.  We remember where it is worth, carefully dispense all three and carefully look at the markings on each one, remember, rewrite or take with us and go to the Internet, looking for the nearest electronic component store. <br><br>  <i>As an option, you probably can find the necessary capacitors from a familiar computer programmer, a blessing in the system builder, there are dozens of them, and any normal piece of iron has fifty or any other electronic placer.</i> <br><br><img src="http://clip2net.com/clip/m0/1333290669-clip-85kb.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Organ transplant </h4><br>  A quick search on the store's website quickly issued the necessary capacitors, at a price of three rubles and a penny each.  We put on pants, quickly run and buy three brand new capacitors.  We come, turn on the soldering iron again, take the acid, process the legs of the new capacitors and tin. <br><br><img src="http://clip2net.com/clip/m0/1333291633-clip-69kb.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Then we clean the contacts from tin, carefully warming up each nest and pushing a thin wire, push out the excess tin, otherwise new legs will be difficult to insert into the old nests.  Then we insert each capacitor in its place, observing the polarity (the negative leg is always marked on such capacitors with a stripe, the number ‚Äú0‚Äù or simply ‚Äú-‚Äù).  The condensers bought by me turned out to be slightly smaller than their relatives, but they are exactly the same in terms of parameters and their work will not differ from the old ones, unless they are close to the board.  Now the board can be carefully turned over and normally, neatly soldered without overheating. <br><br><img src="http://clip2net.com/clip/m0/1333292292-clip-105kb.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="http://clip2net.com/clip/m0/1333292413-clip-127kb.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  We are convinced of the quality of the soldering and fasten the board back, connect all the chips. <br><br><img src="http://clip2net.com/clip/m0/1333292656-clip-123kb.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Carefully check, observing safety precautions - profit!  Works and very well. <br>  <b>The amount of repair was 9 rubles 60 kopecks.</b>  Well, is there a difference?  If interested - google the price of such repairs in normal workshops. <br><br>  <i>Tip: I prefer to repair all home appliances myself.</i>  <i>If I can repair - then this is an extra experience in a personal piggy bank.</i>  <i>If I can‚Äôt, then hand over to the workshop, anyway, the guarantee is long over.</i>  <i>Of course, if the guarantee is not over yet, it would be wise not to even try to open it.</i>  <i>The main thing is not to do worse than it was and to adequately assess your capabilities, otherwise the master will tear off even more from you.</i> <br><br>  As an option, if you do not know how to do nothing at all, but you have a persistent feeling that the price in the workshop does not correspond to the complexity of the work - consult a technical technician friend, you will certainly be helped.  Of course, not free, but not as expensive as in the workshop.  After all, any work must be paid. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/141285/">https://habr.com/ru/post/141285/</a></p>
