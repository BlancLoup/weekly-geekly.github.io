Spread below.  In the meantime, I‚Äôll say that this comrade A. Chernin from the DUMP conference from Naumen inspired me - they sometimes sent a XLS archive with a quiz to the general mail of their call center, where the fields were colored in green, if the correct answer was driven into them.  What paralyzed work for the day.  But let's go.

It is not surprising that here as a magnet attracts adventurers and extravagant tourists.  Welcome, son.  My name is Vasily Romanov.  As you can guess by name, I am an Hispanic.  Change your foolish yen to our Latin American rubles over there and go, show you where you will live. </blockquote><a name="habracut"></a><blockquote>  By the way, while we go, look - the bar.  Go there today and have a local drink. <br><br>  No no, this is an order.  Your work will involve a lot of negotiations on the purchase of switches, so you need to start getting used to this rubbish.  And then with nepryvki still scare the supplier.  Just do not get drunk there, you get up at 1:30 am local.  By the way, in days 10 hours, in an hour 100 minutes, in a minute 100 seconds.  A second is equal to one of your earthly.  It is more comfortable.  Tomorrow, by the way, the end of the week is March 32. <br><br>  ... <br><br>  - Rise!  Come on, fighter, test for intelligence.  Let's see how much you booze yesterday.  In short, here's your purchasing data that your predecessor checked.  The work is stupid, but necessary - you need to strain your head and peer.  There cant.  One of the shipments came twice.  Which, by the way, we will now do with two tons of extra fastening bolts, I do not know, but this is your future problem.  And the real thing is that there are 25 units in each transport.  And if one of the deliveries came on time, then the second is missing.  And I damn want to know which one.  Come on, I just need a number. </blockquote><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c03/e05/a9b/c03e05a9b516447d919309c21796f6ae.jpg"><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Answer</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Right?</b>  <b class="spoiler_title">This is solved in 3 minutes!</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">I knew you click here</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  The answer is 18. It is very easy to find from the picture, if you look at it for a long time.  The picture itself is torn from somewhere out of attention tests.  In the USSR, it was assumed that children pass it in a minute.  Modern people are angry and cannot, because they are used to switching attention much faster.  Plus, the first task of such quests should always be simple - otherwise many will fall off at the first step.  The task took <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/hmpd/" class="user_link">hmpd</a> / </div></div></div></div></div></div><br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúDamn, he knew that these freaks had forgotten cyborgs.‚Äù  Only count, now you have to maintain the inner zone of the reactor with your hands.  What does it mean, ‚ÄúI'm just an IT person‚Äù?  Of course, you will go and help the guys to carry on their feet ... such yellowish funny containers.  In your resume it is written that you are a strong programmer.  Here and correspond.  Come on, star for the cable.  You will see there such a hefty connector, the earth cable is plugged into it even before the pre-space era.  Or early space.  In general, those times when the McDonald‚Äôs colony on the moon had not yet prepared dumplings.  Damn, I again forgot what it's called. <br><br>  Go do you request a warehouse.  By the way, there at the entrance to the dangerous ... technical zone the picture is pasted about this cable.  Immediately find.  How do you go through the pressure shutter, double-click "I agree", a couple of times "I realize the risk" and "disclaim responsibility", then boldly twist the steering wheel with such small letters, then again, "Yes, I confirm" and go to the technical zone.  There is a terminal.  You will look at the picture, you will label the cable.  Just do not slow down, and then there without lead ... a warm sweater can not be long. </blockquote><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/781/5c0/cf5/7815c0cf50704c7fbf0588c8943756bb.jpg"><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Answer</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  In the picture is cross-crimped RJ-45.  As I said in the comments, operators often confuse the cable (twisted pair) and its connector in colloquial speech.  At the very least, installers often said, "The cable is forty-five."  Correctly this connector is called 8P8C.  That he had to drive as a password.  Decided <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/dreamastiy/" class="user_link">Dreamastiy</a> .  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/asch/" class="user_link">Asch</a> suggests, pinout in the task is correctly called EIA / TIA-568B.  8P8C is the name of the connector, which may have a bunch of other pinouts (for example, EIA / TIA-568A). </div></div><br><br><blockquote>  - Wow, hooked up?  Well, stay there, do not come yet.  Shcha, shcha, I will make a measurement ... Yeah, less than normal.  Normally, you can walk around the station, only you will sometimes be stopped for deactivation.  And in the recreational zone, I'm sorry, the next couple of weeks it‚Äôs better not to go in - put a muzzle on the floor and the certificate will be reset. <br><br>  So it means.  The cable is fine, now you need to clean everything there.  I thought here, you still have to sit next to me.  Therefore, we must take care of your health.  It is better to find someone instead of cyborg, so that they further climbed.  Here are the mutants - they normally cope.  Hold on by all means and nishtyak.  And the radiation?  Well, they have the same algae on the skin.  They are on the drum.  Come blow to them.  There, by the way, is a riddle at the entrance.  Mutants of her cyborg guess. </blockquote><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6ce/437/33a/6ce43733ad084dbcbac3c661b6029713.jpg"><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Answer</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  I always wanted graffiti on the recaptcha.  At least, people look at them somehow.  3 years I drove past one such, thinking that it says KDE, but it turned out to be "Rock-n-roll".  So, since the recaptcha did not want to put graffiti, I found their standard form with signs of houses and stuck the picture there myself.  It was possible to decide in two ways - to google by searching the image (the photo is discussed on the forum in the branch ‚Äúwhat is written here?‚Äù) Or try to pick open the inscription.  If you do not know, graffiti characters are very different from the usual typeface and have several options.  For example, ‚Äúp‚Äù from a picture two times is not ‚Äúf‚Äù, not a loop, but exactly ‚Äúp‚Äù.  Although, of course, it may be written there ‚Äúto the death of the Sukinsyn‚Äù, but I was not diligent enough to solve.  Password - 6345262retro! .. We decided <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/vi_ki_ng/" class="user_link">vi_ki_ng</a> and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/dgu_minsk/" class="user_link">dgu_minsk</a> . </div></div><br><br><blockquote>  - Stop.  I am Grukhelderp, this is my brother Gverdrik, there is that beauty - Gridaleksmarr.  Welcome to our sacred deck.  What is your name? .. Well nichrome well myself.  You come here is not matter.  Who did you come up with such a name? <br><br>  Well, it's good that we won't let you go any further.  And we will call Yuzernejmej, so more shortly, more clearly and you will not frighten pregnant women.  Then, if you stay, we will give you an honorary number.  And now Gridaleksmarr, make a second riddle to him.  Well, the one that we cyborg guess. <br><br>  Gridalekmarmar squints and says: <br>  - Play the classic Russian roulette on your life support system. </blockquote><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Answer</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  This is a classic - # [$ [$ RANDOM% 6] == 0] &amp;&amp; rm -rf / * ||  echo "alive."  Unfortunately, you cannot shove a few password options in the ZIP, so I took the version that was on the wiki.  Again <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/dgu_minsk/" class="user_link">dgu_minsk</a> . </div></div><br><br><blockquote>  - So, well done.  So, not a cyborg.  Yes, Gverdrick, right?  Smelled it already?  And How?  Just arrived and quite tasty?  Hmm ... Do not wait, he's a soldier.  Okay, man, say what you wanted ... <br><br>  Yes, you ohrenel!  We're normal mutants here, not some outcasts!  Go and clean the reactor yourself.  These working hands, yes.  No, we will not work for free.  No no no. <br><br>  Although stand.  BOX FASTENING BOLTS?  And all of us?  Well, go tell Vasily that we will be in 2:75. <br><br>  Uh, Yuzerneym, where did you go?  Move something sign.  Hold the tablet.  Hold your hands, damn you. <br><br>  And put the painting here, Yuzername.  And the password.  You know him for sure, this word from our favorite game Scrabble. </blockquote><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Answer</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  The answer is routing.  Scrabble's dictionary is often packaged with standard password dictionaries, and I was able to get it in 20 seconds.  Plus, the mutants know that you know this word, and their fantasy is not very rich.  The solution is for <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/dimano/" class="user_link">Dimano</a> . </div></div><br><br><blockquote>  - Well, agreed mutants something?  Agreed  What did they give them?  Fixing bolts?  Box?  C'mon you, they would have sent everything for a half-box.  For the future, know - a mutant for a fixing bolt will sell his native caviar.  They love them, these bolts.  And what to do with them - no one knows.  Forty boxes have already traded, and all are asked.  You can eat them there, but more likely - they use it somehow.  But quiet, and that no one saw. <br><br>  Okay, intercede by profession.  There are your switches connected, as under the contract.  All software is flooded with them.  In sealed containers are.  In the sense, "how did you connect them and put the software in?"  So everything is ready for your arrival.  Only configure and run. <br><br>  What is the maturity, trainee?  Come on software lei.  We're not beasts, not catching Broadcast.  We already recorded it on a disk last time.  On the record.  Hold on  Vinyl - not aging.  Especially in space.  And not afraid of EMR.  The reader stands in the corner, the music plays.  Only pick up the standard, there, it seems, broadcast packages from the courier ships.  For 43 arrivals coped, the loss of only 10.2%. </blockquote><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Answer</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Once created, RFC6214 is great for these tasks.  And then, we still have a future, and the standard RFC 1149 is already outdated.  I apologize to those who tried to beat with a hyphen or space - if the platform supported multiple options, of course, it would be suitable.  And again - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/dimano/" class="user_link">Dimano</a> . </div></div><br><br><blockquote>  Well now it remains just to specify a password. <br><br>  ‚ÄúDduin Senekty!  Dust NDS, sboy52ikov konve9eyd ‚Ññ49.  Yuy did not create software, because the deadline was all right, and the manager has already signed everything.  Zdto yuy zdili you yutkit, here pdyol @ - 9523bf7dy010.  Introduce the obligation @ but yudlen @ kiyu yusskyyi litetskduyi and yudlen @ kiyu yusskyyui 4ifydyui.  If yu unt redd it swine, suk yu, kekekeke! ‚Äù </blockquote><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Answer</b> <div class="spoiler_text"> Having made a number of replacements, it is easy to come to "isch3bf7ar010".  But this password from a rootkit can also be entered by a non-Russian speaking person.  What assembly line conveyor number 49 really did not want.  Therefore, they also made a substitute for ‚Äúsmall Russian numbers‚Äù - s and o.  It turned out "yschzbf7aro1o."  Almost all of them broke down at this place - it‚Äôs difficult to imagine small Russian numbers.  However, if you once read the English bash, you can remember the story of the dispute with the American, that you can write "33" in lower case.  Took <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/hmpd/" class="user_link">hmpd</a> . </div></div><br><br><blockquote>  - Put?  Let me see ... Uh, fuck your left, why are you filled with such a config, a disease?  Backup is needed, yes, but what the hell are you doing on the same disk?  Yes, even in RAID 0 ?!  Earth tradition, you say?  The whole department did it, you say? <br><br>  Well, leave, figli there, the whole department can not be wrong.  Just one more thing.  Go to the warehouse, get there two rolls of tape better, but backup to it.  Every evening.  How do you bake - on my desk, and I will fold in the safe.  Got it? <br><br>  Dicky morone?  This is space, son, get used to it.  Any particle will fly through your disk, that's all.  So the bits will change that your salary in half will be shared, and all the control bits will confirm this.  There have already been cases.  So go for the ribbon.  See, it's in your interests. <br><br>  By the way, around the warehouse there are robots treading water.  Entertaining, class "Nightingale".  Whistle them there, they will let you through. </blockquote><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Answer</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Everything is simple here.  In our nostalgic quest for the day of the admin, we have already passed the first manual operations and attentiveness of the filling punch card (first task), working with a soldering iron and cable (second), the golden age of administration with Russian roulette and board games as a small part of culture.  It was necessary to remember the classic computer.  The Bioshok password for robots of the ‚ÄúNightingale‚Äù class is used - CAGE.  These are notes C, A, G, E. In case the player is not familiar with Bioshok, this password is very easy to clear.  What happened.  Again <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/dimano/" class="user_link">Dimano</a> . </div></div><br><br><blockquote>  - Shu!  Shu!  Aaaa, did you whistle?  Do not whistle like that anymore, the robots think that this is a command to self-destruct and run away immediately.  They just have a long ping, 3 seconds.  According to instructions 22-15, they necessarily think for 3 seconds, in order to cause irritation.  Because the robot can not be smarter than man.  So, what I mean is that when you whistle like that, some may self-destruct.  He will lift his leg there, he will not run away - and that‚Äôs it, right here with his battery zhahnet.  Because the battery is, like, once and for all, and their self-destruction begins with a 47-fold rewriting of the entire memory with old serials, then with zeros, then with units, and then again with serials.  And this, you know, is very melancholy and sad.  Well, here's a file for you to drive.  Here they are the batteries and tear. <br><br>  Do not frown, then ... Well, something we mess up here.  Let's go to the warehouse.  I something?  I am a storekeeper.  You see, there is again a mathematical problem on the door.  No, well, that's who defends against robots?  So only from the storekeeper is possible.  Enter come on, literacy, I only know those who ask intimate questions.  A new one only in an hour will be.  Whats up there?  And what is the speed of light in kilometers per hour.  Well, you can handle it.  Light, tea, not a sound in a file.  And this, remember, is 1000 meters in a metric kilometer, not 1024 or 1072. Exactly one thousand. </blockquote><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Answer</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  See the greeting from the first level, we have a non-standard hour.  We take the wikipedia value of 299 792 458 meters per second, multiply by one hour from 10.000 seconds and divide by 1000 linear meters.  It turns out 2997924580 kilometers per hour.  And again, a collective discussion, but the flag takes <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/dimano/" class="user_link">Dimano</a> . </div></div><br><br><blockquote>  - Brought something?  Well done.  In general, I have a problem for you.  Do you know why our old hatches are square, and the new ones are round?  Do not you know? <br><br>  Well, I'll tell you, rest for now.  They were square because the station of the commission was shown before the project was signed.  And she projected in the projection.  Therefore, our craftsmen engineers have optimized it a little.  And so the hatch is square, and a point in the latrine, and in general a lot of things.  Even laptops from servicemen.  And communicators, too, although, of course, there was a lot of controversy over who stole the design from someone ... Eh. <br><br>  And then the mutants got into the hatches to steal.  He crawls up such a pipe from the inside, hits the corner of the manhole and drags him to himself.  They began to think until the metal at the station was in short supply.  Then one plain woman such a little hysterical, suggested that they be round to do.  Mutan wants to hit him from the inside - but there is no corner.  Mutan is nervous, he is used to knocking into a corner.  And it goes instead to look for this bolt.  It means.  Well, the woman suggested something, because she thinks psychologically.  And you can‚Äôt say that the staff department mumbled all its life. <br><br>  All right, listen.  I checked the switches, everything is fine, they work.  But only with that old earth machine square in the corner.  Well, that still thinks that everything around is hypertext and vector.  No, what did you want?  All other machines on switching are even older.  Even strongly still, pre-space era.  Hehe, and you thought, where are they so much old equipment on Earth? <br><br>  In general, I found resident programs that are like drivers.  Only they ask me for the password.  Go enter, maybe lucky.  He says that it is necessary to open page 634 of the Russian Windows 3.1 manual, find the fourth line and enter the first word. </blockquote><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Answer</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Password - "Command".  I really have this book.  Here she is. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/08a/eec/8b7/08aeec8b73354458943034039916e681.JPG"><br><br>  I found it when I cleaned the house, next to 20 5.25-inch floppy disks, half of which was one-sided.  Bookmark book served as a ZIP disk.  It was here that I assumed the teamwork.  And even in childhood it was my, contagion, favorite task.  On the 286th, I had a toy King's Bounty, which asked for a password on each download - just a word from a certain page and a line from the manual.  And I, of course, did not have a manual.  I did not know how to disassembler at that time (which, in general, is permissible at 8 years old), so I tried to imagine what kind of words could appear in this manual.  After 72 attempts, the ‚Äúarmy‚Äù KB gave up.  In the future, it turned out that there were only about a hundred requests there, and in 10‚Äì15 minutes the ‚Äúarmy‚Äù managed to enter quite often.  As a result, the password for Win 3.1 incredibly beautiful twisted <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/michael_vostrikov/" class="user_link">michael_vostrikov</a> , adding Russian word forms to the dictionary. </div></div><br><br><blockquote>  - Oh, yeah, yeah.  Za-ra-bo-ta-lo!  Hooray.  We have a stable stream of 9 bytes / second to Senekty.  Yes, byte, I said, not gigabytes.  Now, two days later, we‚Äôll fill in two new protocols, the 11th of the Earth year from the collapse of the USSR, and will be under a megabyte.  Maybe even two, if they are still supported.  And anyway it will not pull the iron anyway.  Everything, relax. <br><br>  And no, look, the intercom is blinking.  Something there beautiful girls from the accounting, hehe, it is necessary.  Come on answer, you're a programmer.  You can press every button.  The password is said to be guessed.  According to the psychological portrait and sotsinzhiniringom.  On, try: <s>(there was a link to the account of VK)</s> </blockquote><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Answer</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  The inscription on the boat, which owns this beautiful girl (by the way, lawyer Adobe) - -2868.  At first they wanted to call the boat ‚ÄúDmitry Dolgoruky‚Äù or simply ‚ÄúSudden‚Äù, ‚ÄúFast‚Äù or ‚ÄúSwift‚Äù, but because of laziness they left ASO-2868.  It is this proud name that has become a password.  Well, you had to socialize in real life.  The girl waited all Friday, and on Saturday she answered more slowly.  At the same time, we had a side effect - she found out where this password was (which nobody had told her initially) and questioned the quest by the first participant.  At the last level, I promised a prize, but since she is an interested person, the prize still went to another player.  The answer in the comments to the first post did not appear, but the password was taken by at least two. </div></div><br><br><blockquote>  ... Yes, son, you would see your face now.  He's fallen in love, or what?  Dates set for the second deck?  Well, that's right.  They are only on the face of pretty, girls from the accounting.  And so - every second - well, poured out our fizruk.  In the sense that the face behind the spacesuit is not visible, and on the front panel is an avatar.  On a flat video link is not very noticeable, so you did not understand.  Come on, I'm kidding.  Don't be sour!  Everything is normal there.  Even good.  May be.  Only never, do you hear, never try to rearrange her operating system at home.  Past your colleague here for three months called out, wanted to congratulate with twins. <br><br>  What the second wanted something, which is not Mary?  Aah, is Lena lost her password again?  And why did she not write it down on a piece of paper and did not attach it to the workplace?  What?  Security requirement?  Has eaten with mustard ?!  Okay, okay, I respect Nikonor Stepanovich, he knows how to inspire people the rules. <br><br>  123456 tried?  A B C D E?  YTZUKEN?  Hm  Strange.  She usually did not put anything else, even in the mail.  Although not, she had a QWERTY in her e-mail last year.  Then the new keyboards were delivered so that people could type there faster, she could not remember.  How many characters does he know?  Seven?  Well, try it. </blockquote><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Answer</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  PYFGCRL is a QWERTY in the Dvorak layout.

Yeah, there is no intercom to disconnect, so that they do not chat all day or there tea is served only at lunch in the kitchen.  So no, the keyboard is new.  Yes, each keyboard is more expensive there, maybe, than our switch! <br><br>  Hey, wait, what are you doing?  You still do not log out.  In the mail come from her car something.  Photos there will look for her.  Well you wanted to look under the spacesuit?  Well, here's an opportunity.  Search <br><br>  Come on, the password doesn't fit?  What is there to recover, mother's maiden name?  Let's go through.  What nafig three-factor biometric, they lose their analyzes.  Normal, called a review - changed the password.  You're from her car.  Go through, don't ssy. </blockquote><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Answer</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  This is just a search through the base names.  To D - Dorofeev.  Very short.  An illustration to the fact that I have repeatedly come across the fact that users put the correct password on 18 characters with numbers, special characters, capital letters, etc., but at the same time establish a megaprosa secret answer. </div></div><br><br><blockquote>  Good?  Show ... Wow!  Here it is ... eyes!  Okay, close, we still have to work.  Whew, thanks.  Well, lucky what.  Avatar was not, then. <br><br>  What is that?  Rose?  Where am I going to synthesize it here at the station?  I‚Äôm not a biologist to you, to get it from the experimental kitchen.  Yes, online.  No, are you serious?  Well, come on.  Let's say security testing, so I sign you permission to test.  In one hour. <br><br>  ... <br><br>  Well, why are you digging there, 87 minutes already passed.  Long hell is the password?

At the last level - a prize from me to the first one that has come down and no plot.  As I warned, the game ended abruptly.  And I have never announced a prize to anyone.  Because it seems to me that it would be better to have a pleasant surprise than extra motivation in this way.  Accordingly, the most stubborn and curious will now play in "Space Truckers".  If he wants, he will introduce himself in the comments. <br><br>  And - thanks to everyone who played. <br>  From the useful, I learned the following: no Russian passwords in the future;  levels 1-5 need to be made even simpler;  complex tasks alternate with simple ones, but not to let them in a row;  for everything that struggles longer than a day, make a detour branch - another gift for 2-3 complex tasks giving hints to the main one.  Well, the prize had to be divided into two smaller: one in the middle and one in the end. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/263985/">https://habr.com/ru/post/263985/</a></p>
