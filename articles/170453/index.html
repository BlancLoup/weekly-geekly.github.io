  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Subjective sound comparison of Apple iPhone 5, Meizu MX2, Nokia Lumia 920 and Xiaomi Mi-Two</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Welcome, Habraludi!  In November last year, we carried out a subjective sound comparison of several popular smartphones, including the Meizu MX and Nokia Lumia 920. <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/meizu/blog/160195/">Here it is</a> .  This time the list of participants has changed a little, and the main reason for the new comparison is the participation of our flagship Meizu MX2.  We again decided to compare the sound quality in current smartphones from different manufacturers, in order to understand at what level Meizu MX2 is in this group.  They again turned to Ilya Tarakanov for help.  The important thing is that everything you read below is the subjective opinion of one person who often and often listens to music on different devices. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/13d/1b8/f2c/13d1b8f2c35f0721ef0470be9eeeec57.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Testing conditions:</b>

Based on the experience of the author listening to the test disk on various devices, including the top players Hifiman HM-801 ( <a href="">page on Yandex.Market</a> ), Colorful Colorfly C4 ( <a href="">page on Yandex.Market</a> ), iBasso DX-100 ( <a href="">page on Yandex.Market</a> ) . <br><br>  For various reasons, the RMAA package was not used, in the future we will try to fill this gap. <br>  Not used inexpensive headphones.  When testing used high-end headphones, demanding on the source.  They simply hear the difference between smartphones.  It is worth noting that the headphones also introduce their distortions in the test results, thus testing is tied to specific headphones.  Nevertheless, some characteristics will remain unchanged for other headphones, the difference will be in the evenness of the frequency response and (possibly) as a study of frequency ranges.  In principle, this problem can be solved using other high-end headphones - but anyway, errors cannot be avoided here. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6f4/c49/27f/6f4c4927ff80d838beb30d918dfcad47.jpg"><br><br>  First, we consider each device separately, briefly describing the sound handwriting.  Then, in a special table, we will evaluate the devices by various parameters and calculate the total estimates. <br><br>  <b>Abbreviations used:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  LF - low frequencies, such as drums </li><li>  MF - mids, for example, vocals </li><li>  HF - high frequencies, such as percussion </li><li>  DD - dynamic range, quality of working out sounds of different loudness (for example, whisper and shout) </li><li>  Detail - the discernibility of instruments, vocals, etc. </li><li>  Attack - the quality of working out fast-growing sound fronts </li><li>  Stereopanorama - a virtual scene that forms "in the head" of the listener </li><li>  Amp Noise - Subjective Player Amp Noise </li><li>  Comfortable volume - the volume at which to listen to music comfortably </li><li>  Sound evenness - a subjective assessment of the evenness of the frequency response of the player-listener combination </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/981/840/f65/981840f658a7aadc4f78ac260928cb86.png" width="31" height="64">  <b>Apple iPhone 5</b> <br>  The sound is focused on the high frequency, on some tracks it is annoying.  Low frequencies are very high quality, there is minimal buzz on some recordings.  The middle frequencies are well and naturally, their level is normal, the separation of vocal parts is close to excellent.  High frequencies are slightly dirty.  Dynamic range preloaded.  Detail and attack are average.  Noise amplifier can not be heard under any circumstances, the volume margin is half the scale. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/15a/1bc/fcf/15a1bcfcf80e06394e4eb6e00a2b7b7b.png" width="35" height="64">  <b>Meizu MX2</b> <br>  The sound has a slight emphasis on the mid-range, it is not annoying.  The low frequencies are detailed, but not very deep, there is no buzz.  The midrange sounds clean and natural, the vocal separation is excellent.  High frequencies are slightly dirty, their level is normal.  Detail and attack is good, but the dynamic range, unfortunately, is preloaded.  Stereopanorama slightly wider than the head, the detail of the instruments is very good.  Volume reserve is about half the scale.  The amplifier noise is noticeable even in not very quiet recording locations. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f07/55b/006/f0755b0068ea4b92cada4a6300e5c201.png" width="36" height="64">  <b>Meizu MX 4-core</b> <br>  The sound has an emphasis on the low-frequency range.  The level of bass is so high that they are buzzing - and they want to slightly muffle.  The midrange is reproduced normally, the HF is sufficiently transparent.  Stereopanorama slightly wider than the head.  Attack and DD - above average, good detail.  A comfortable volume level is achieved on 2/3 of the scale.  Amplifier noise is heard when headphones are connected and in quiet recording locations. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/453/2c0/fcd/4532c0fcde06cb5607ca6c5a2dd32dfc.png" width="37" height="64">  <b>Nokia Lumia 920</b> <br>  The sound is bright, detailed, the emphasis is on the MF-HF range.  Bass quality, without hum.  The stereopanoram is wide, a little beyond the head, there is a small depth.  The detail and attack are good, DD is normal.  Noise amplifier can not be heard.  Comfortable volume is achieved at half the scale. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2f6/f1e/04f/2f6f1e04fc8fd0be14870f084d1684a4.png" width="32" height="64">  <b>Xiaomi Mi-Two</b> 
<br>  The sound has an emphasis on the low-frequency range.  The bass level is so high that they buzz - and they want to slightly muffle.

Amplifier noise is heard when headphones are connected and in quiet recording locations. <br>  Attack and DD - above average, good detail.  A comfortable volume level is achieved on 2/3 of the scale. <br><br>  <b>Summary table</b> <br><br>  Each characteristic was rated from 0 to 5 points, where 0 is the most bad result and 5 is the most good.  Grades 5 deserve (and even then not in all parameters) ‚Äútop-end‚Äù devices, say, Hifiman HM-801, iBasso DX100, Colorful Colorfly C4.  Their cost is about a thousand dollars, and these are just players - without the ability to make calls. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cce/b09/1bb/cceb091bb2a859391dcd5c09236ae729.png"><br><br>  <b>Conclusion</b> <br><br>  Once again, we recall that testing is completely subjective.  What is its benefit, the reader will ask?  The answer is simple: the advantage is that there is another opinion that has more weight than another review from a fan of this or a device on the forums.  This opinion is based on the experience of listening to a variety of players and smartphones with a couple of hundreds of headphones by the author. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/352/f55/c5b/352f55c5b37b7372c30be95107723116.jpg"><br><br>  It is no secret that recently the music component of the phones has not received much attention.  However, with each generation the sound quality is at least a little, but it is improving - at least in the market as a whole.  But there is still a considerable gap to high-quality players (they can be estimated at 45-50 points), and real music lovers will still have to give a lot of money for them. <br>  If you want a ‚Äúcombine‚Äù - you will have to choose among what is, and we would recommend at least paying attention to the Nokia Lumia 920 - it‚Äôs not very convenient as a player, but it plays music perfectly.  The rest of the list is headed by Meizu MX2, which is on a par with the Apple iPhone 5, Mi-Two is also nearby, but the first Meizu MX is behind, but this is a device of the previous generation. <br>  Meizu did a good ‚Äúbug fix‚Äù and the MX2 sounds better than the previous model, at the same level as the Apple iPhone 5. <br>  Thank you for your attention, waiting for your feedback, wishes and suggestions. <br><br>  Material prepared by <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/ilyatarakanov/" class="user_link">IlyaTarakanov</a> <br><br>  <b><i>DISCLAIMER</i></b> // <i>The author of the text warns that the test results and conclusions based on subjective assessments of sound do not claim to be 100% true.</i>  <i>There are many methods for assessing the sound quality of various devices, the reader is given only one of them, and his right is to agree or disagree with it both in whole and in part.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/170453/">https://habr.com/ru/post/170453/</a></p>
