 How to use a device with a 200 MHz processor? Is it a lot or a little?

Is it a lot or a little? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  This is what I tried to use: <br>  Listening to music is quite possible, but everything is complicated by the lack of a standard ‚Äúfinger output to the headphones‚Äù, so I have to use my own headset with a microphone or use a bluetooth headset (headphones), which immediately affects the life of the phone from the battery, yes And the headphones themselves will have to be recharged often.  I am silent about podcasts, - all that is for downloading and updating subscriptions to podcasts is a sad shit, windows media player 11 does not support podcasts as such, all crutches are no good.  Only an old proven iPod nano saves :) <br><br>  Record audio notes. <br>  With the help of Resco Record, it is quite possible, but the special buttons for calling the dictaphone at the wheelbarrow are not provided, so in a car, for example, on the go pull out of the case, and launching Resco recorder with your finger without starting an emergency on the road is a miracle!  The start time of the audio recording program is about 10 seconds, during which time you can already forget everything you wanted to dictate.

      Read-write in Excel. <br>  In this regard, yes, indeed, the only reason justifying the use of the wheelbarrow is the ability to read and write Excel files and small files in Word format from a computer to a device. <br><br>  Maintain personal finance. <br>  It was not an easy task.  The best choice is Cash Organizer 2008, but it‚Äôs not loaded at the speed of light either, it sometimes has problems with synchronization with MS Money, especially if you do it seriously and you are budgeting.  SPB Finance - poyuzal and threw, because slowly and buggy.  AceMoney 1.1.2 - brakes shamelessly, no functionality. <br><br>  Synchronization with Exchange. <br>  For me, in general, the concept of placing Exchange into the world is poorly understood, I personally try to hide it behind firewalls and a border unix mailer.  An intelligent antispam (I‚Äôm not talking about a free one) could not be found for Ekschendzh.  Antivirus software is Forefront, although the product is good, but not cheap.  In short, I didn‚Äôt manage to properly configure the device to synchronize with an accessory without vpn.  It was possible to synchronize via vpn, but also in a not quite direct way.  Correct setting vpn, but also his work through gprs / edge is generally not an easy task.  Unless to use Exchange Hosted Services from third-party operators and pay monthly.  It's sad all this.  When GPRS / EDGE is working when moving between cells, the connection breaks and is not automatically restored, which makes it impossible to receive mail via the notorious Exchange Mail Push, as well as associated services that require a connection, for example, Yandex.Prob. <br><br>  Cartography and navigation. <br>  Here, the ‚Äúspeed‚Äù of the processor does not give any reason to think about the possibility of using mobile navigation maps like Visicom.  And if you also connect a GPS, the picture will get worse. <br><br>  Read fb2. <br>  Yes, there is an AlReader.  Reading in most cases is a simple and resource-free process.  However, the screen size is still not 3.5 " <br><br>  Typing. <br>  Typing is inconvenient.  Fast typing with a stylus is fraught with errors, apparently the same ‚Äúfast‚Äù processor does not have time to handle pressing the stylus on the touchscreen.  Typing without a stylus is slow and painful.  A little bitter bitterness was the newly found soft keyboard TouchPal, which allows you to type letters in slides (by pulling your finger across the screen to the side).  And, well, to switch to this clave from the keyboard, by default you will have to either get the stylus, or try to push the nail into the small button on the keyboard selection, which is nonsense. <br><br>  Browsing the Internet. <br>  Built-in IE is slow and wretched.  Opera?  Opera yes, a bit saves. <br><br>  Personal organizer MyLife Organized. <br>  Loads a long time (parses the entire file).  Working without a stylus is almost impossible. <br><br>  Case. <br>  At first, the cover seemed to me a practical and comfortable thing, rubberized on the outside and velvety on the inside.  Indeed, it protects the surface from scratches.  After a year of use, the cover began to crack.  And even the skill acquired during the year of using the device does not make it easier to attempt to remove the device with one hand.  When the device calls and you frantically try to pull it out of the fashionable slipcoat, you can inadvertently reset the incoming call. <br><br>  Camera. <br>  The camera, at first glance, shoots passable.  But again, the taste of shit leaves the launch time of the camera application - 7-8 seconds, depending on the current load. <br><br>  What pleased: <br>  Internet Sharing application, with which you can easily get a working gpsr / edge Internet on a laptop via usb cable, or via bluetooth.  And, of course, PocketHeroes 1.0.3, which, to my great surprise, did not slow down at all, I will attribute this merit to the efforts of the developers. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/30524/">https://habr.com/ru/post/30524/</a></p>
