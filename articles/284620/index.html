My colleagues took mobile phones and personal belongings, were not allowed to go to the toilet for a few hours, humiliated and insulted. <br><br>  The pretext for what is happening is an offense that we did not commit, a provocation planned and implemented by law enforcement agencies.  The real reason is the refusal to remove T-shirts from the affiliate stores of the ProstoPrint.com service saying ‚ÄúThank you to the residents of Donbass ...‚Äù. <br><br>  For the fifth day now, I, the director and owner of the company, are not allowed to meet with the investigator, they do not take any explanations.  Militiamen refuse to communicate with me even on the basis of the agenda they have written out!  Although I was not hiding, I am always in touch and assert: ProstoPrint.com did not violate the laws of Ukraine, cooperated and will continue to cooperate with the right holders to form a civilized Internet environment in our country.

      On Monday, September 12, the employees of ProstoPrint are again invited to be interrogated at the Department of the Organized Crime Control Department at the address: Kiev, st.  Gorky, 114. Many - for the third or fourth time, while they do not write out subpoenas, and "recommended" to come up by a phone call!  Some refuse and ask to write out the official agenda - but I have a large team, there are people who are afraid, intimidated and confused (good, they can do it in the UBOP), and I have no right to demand that all my colleagues have a daring heroism. <br><br>  Now the employees of ProstoPrint are being interrogated not on charges of copyright infringement - obviously, in this part the accusation is cracking at the seams, it is all painful to sew with white threads.  Investigators are interested in everything, from the length of staff probationary periods to fire safety in the office (how does this relate to Euro 2012 ???).  Employees are offered to rewrite the previously given testimony under the dictation of the investigator, but DO NOT use the services of a lawyer on the grounds that ‚Äúthe lawyer is not supposed to be a witness‚Äù. <br><br>  I ask everyone who follows the situation, who empathizes and offers help, to take part in the flash mob - on Monday, September 12, from morning until 16:00 near the UBOP building in Kiev, on ul.  Gorky (Antonovich), 114. <br><br>  The mob has two goals: 1) to support people who come for interrogation on Monday, to strengthen their psychological state and faith in themselves and all of us;  2) once again show the police that their actions are under the scrutiny of people, and people do not require anything supernatural, except for law and justice. <br><br>  I especially emphasize that there will be no need to stand and hold a rally, I understand that everyone has their own affairs and concerns.  Just come / come for 5 minutes at any convenient time, make an action, which I will write about below - and work further, implement projects, feed families and children, while knowing that you (really) helped in the fight against the disagreement that the police He continues to repair in relation to not just the JustPrint, but to his ordinary employees - young guys and girls. <br><br>  WHAT SHOULD BE DONE <br><br>  If you are walking or using public transport: <br><br>  1. Print the ProstoPrint.com logo on A4 paper.  It can be taken on this link. <br><br>  <a href="">dl.dropbox.com/u/4651429/pp_logo_big.png</a> <br>  <a href="">dl.dropbox.com/u/4651429/pp_logo.eps</a> (vector) <br><br>  2. If you do not want to print a logo - no problem, just write the words of support.  For example: "Guys, hold on" or "Police, we are watching you." <br><br>  3. Come to the building of the Organized Crime Control Department of Kiev on the street.  Gorky, 114 ( <a href="http://maps.yandex.ru/-/CBeBI8Z-">Yandex map</a> ) - this is one block from the Vladimirsky market closer to the center - and attach a sheet to the fence of the UBOP from the outside, trees, pillars near the entrance and in the parking lot.  This is a public territory, and they can not forbid us to do this. <br><br>  It's all.  From 8:00 to 10:00, I will be near the UBOP building - if you want, come, talk, drink tea from plastic cups.  Then I will go to file complaints to the Prosecutor General‚Äôs Office, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and other instances. <br><br>  If you are by car: <br><br>  Driving past the UBOP building, just signal with a long beep - just like we did near the CEC building in 2004.  My colleagues, being inside, will hear and understand that this signal is in their support. <br><br>  And the militiamen, if they have even a drop of conscience left, will probably think about whether what they are doing at the moment is correct. <br><br>  I very much count on your support.  I especially appeal to socially active users of social networks - invite to the participation of caring friends and acquaintances, retweet, like and most importantly - COME.  I also very much hope for the help of youth and public organizations: guys, send ten activists, let everyone take ten sheets - and this will be the best help. Thank you in advance.  BREAK ON! <br><br>  Original: <a href="http://www.facebook.com/notes/%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581-%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2/%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5-%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D1%2586%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B2-%25D1%2584%25D0%25BB%25D1%258D%25D1%2588%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1-12-%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D1%258F%25D0%25B1%25D1%2580%25D1%258F/213478505379693%3Fref%3Dnotif%26notif_t%3Dnote_reply">Facebook Denis Oleynikov</a> <br><br>  PS <br>  transferred to Dura Lex </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/284620/">https://habr.com/ru/post/284620/</a></p>
