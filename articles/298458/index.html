  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to translate the idea into a successful startup</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Jacques Fresco once said: <blockquote>  <i>I have always been interested in the work of Leonardo Da Vinci, but most of all I was interested in learning about his surroundings.</i> </blockquote>  And this really makes a lot of sense, because in fact great ideas do not come just like that, but are a product based on life experience and communication with the right people.  We decided to share our experience of creating <a href="http://www.ackuna.ru/">Ackuna</a> startup and collected some tips for beginners. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/65d/28a/0c3/65d28a0c35fb44bfa450247b3c449f93.png" align="right"><br>  Many dream to be entrepreneurs.  Ideas can come at any time - in the shower, during leisure, dinner, or before bedtime.  But most of them remain just ideas, although potentially there may be successful solutions, but the hardest part lies ahead.  Turning a concept into reality takes a lot of time and labor, so you have to move your passion.  In addition, it is much easier to devote 20 hours a day to something that you are really passionate about. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  <font color="#D1AA0F">Explore and chat</font> </h3><br>  Customers are not always simple.  Do your research to fully understand what they need, even if they themselves do not know what they really want.  Always analyze companies and their products on the market in order to understand what they do well and where they could achieve the best results.  You can learn something from anyone, and it's hard to say where a conversation can lead.  Do not hesitate to once again send an email, make another call or go to one more meeting.  Aim at people who will be able to help you.  Being a shy person, it is sometimes very difficult to find the courage to reach out.  But you will be amazed how much support and willingness to help people can demonstrate even after one conversation.  Do not be afraid to ask, especially since there is nothing to lose when you believe in your product.

    <h3>  <font color="#D1AA0F">Find the right team</font> </h3><br>  Entrepreneurship can be a boring and exhausting process.  Find a team that complements your skill set.  Always look for new people who could help achieve the desired results.  It is very important to have a distant view, but be flexible in the way of achieving your goals.  Successful entrepreneurs are those who are able to make changes on the fly, while relying on feedback from the market.  It is not enough to think only about what you are doing.  One should also be critical of the questions ‚Äúwhy?‚Äù And ‚Äúhow?‚Äù.  Let's say you are a salesman and you are tasked with making 50 cold calls a day.  Instead of doing it insanely, until you are charged with something else, you need to be able to think critically about your work and think about what would be more efficient. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#D1AA0F">Enjoy the moment</font> </h3><br>  It is easy to be disappointed if there is no progress.  Be sure to take the time to stop and evaluate everything you and your team have achieved so far.  This gives an extra push to work and continue to translate your idea into reality.  Enjoy the moment and use your progress to fuel success. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#D1AA0F">Adapt</font> </h3><br>  Successful startups are constantly changing based on feedback and data that they collect.  The changes are permanent, and you may find that your job description changes overnight.  Often you have to do work that is not related to your regular duties at all.  Or your company may even open up in something else, for example, as Instagram.  The ability to change the course of development makes startups exciting, but as a member of the team you should also be ready to adapt, which includes finding new ideas and learning new skills.  Startups love people who are one step ahead and are ready to solve new tasks in a period of growth and change. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#D1AA0F">Believe</font> </h3><br>  There will always be difficult days when you can fail and something will go wrong as planned, or you have not achieved certain tasks that you have set for yourself.  Be your own fan and keep believing your idea.  Use the support of friends and family.  Your passion and, of course, hard work will ultimately lead your company to success! <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298458/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298458/</a></p>
