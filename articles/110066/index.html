To some extent, it remains so to this day.  I made my first attempt to understand what was happening after the publication of the rules for registering domain names in the Cyrillic runet.  My interest, idle and childish in its own way, increased after the publication of the so-called.  "Stop list" for the zone of the Russian Federation.  Butter on coals poured a recent <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/domains/109564/">post</a> in the domainer habrablog. <br><br>  I am aware of the fact that I am risking to turn my garden into a semblance of a Karesansui rock garden.  But the number of completely incomprehensible, in my opinion, blunders allowed by Ru-Center when organizing the launch of Cyrillic domains, for my naive consciousness seemed simply monstrous.  However, this can be said about any other monopoly that reigns in Russia.  You will not have to go far for an example: I personally work in one of the divisions of the Russian Railways.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  "... and adultery has come" </h4><br><br>  Watching the <a href="http://stat.reg.ru/domains%3Ftld%3Drf%26org%3DZakrytoe%2Bakcionernoe%2Bobshchestvo%2BRegionalnyj%2BSetevoj%2BInformacionnyj%2BCentr%2B(ZAO%2BRSIC)%26registered%3DNOT%2520REGISTERED">magic domains</a> being released by the Ru-Center, I remember the whole school-student reserve of the alternative Russian.  Coupled with the entire classic set of obscene jokes.  What is the meaning of stop listing as such, if you let such names float freely?  And if <a href="http://stat.reg.ru/whois%3Ftld%3Drf%26domain%3D%25D5%25D3%25C9-%25C7%25C0%25C1%25C5%25C9.%25D0%25D4">some names</a> can still be comprehended and understood (the link is a domain name that repeats the name of the underground vocal and instrumental ensemble), then I personally have no doubt about the purpose of the <a href="http://stat.reg.ru/whois%3Ftld%3Drf%26domain%3D%25C1%25CB%25DF%25C4%25C8-%25CC%25CE%25D1%25CA%25C2%25DB.%25D0%25D4">others</a> .  If the potential owner refuses to register the Ru-Center, then you can try to conduct it through another registrar. <br><br><h4>  Do not count other people's money </h4><br><br>  Andrei Vorobiev said that during the <a href="http://info.nic.ru/auction/index.html">auctions</a> for the resale of ‚Äúgood‚Äù domains, the Ru-Center earned <a href="">24 million rubles</a> .  Not bad, considering that the fact of sales became possible only due to the position of the monopolist. <br><br>  However, using the figures published by the Ru-Center itself (multiplying the number of sold names by the average cost), we get a number that differs from that stated by an order of magnitude.  To be precise, according to statistics at 12:00 14.XII.2010 I got: <br><br>  22819 * 12252 = 279,578,388 <br><br>  The calculations used were: positive integers, Russian rubles and the Casio fx-82ES engineering calculator. <br><br>  Separately, I note that during the observation the parameter ‚Äúaverage cost‚Äù rose to 12.252 rubles from 3.100 rubles. <br><br>  At the moment, at the auction exhibited very, very tasty names.  People until the last fight either with each other, or with bots, prices soar, as a result, to the skies.  Rather arbitrary selection: <br><br><ul><li>  autoinsurance.rf - $ 20.505 </li><li>  Agency.rf - $ 22,235 </li><li>  antivirus.rf - $ 30,004 </li><li>  boutique.rf - $ 41,002 </li><li>  ege.rf - $ 55,000 </li><li>  conditioners. rf - $ 90,000 </li><li>  site.rf - $ 30,005 </li><li>  cement.rf - $ 162,005 </li><li>  Shina.RF - $ 70,000 </li><li>  help. rf - $ 5 039 </li></ul><br><br>  By the way, and for the sake of laughter: if you believe the same list from which domain names are taken from the paragraph above, the auction price of the name "Lenin.rf" is only $ 614.  The grandfather of all the Octobrists for nothing that occupies the most prestigious apartments in the center of Moscow - the auctioneers are not interested in them. <br><br>  A full list of redeemed names can be found <a href="http://info.nic.ru/auction/domains.php%3Fp%3D1">there</a> . <br><br>  However, quite recently, the Ru-Center <a href="http://www.nic.ru/news/2010/rf_case_changes2.html">made changes to the rules of the conditions of the tendering of domains</a> .  Why the registrar tightens the rules is an open question.  Official explanations of the company in this regard can be found there, on the website.  But the idea that in this way the organizers of the bidding provoke a bot war in the bidding appeared among many, <a href="http://www.itar-tass.com/level2.html%3FNewsID%3D15765734%26PageNum%3D0">and the media echoed it</a> .  <a href="http://www.rosbalt.ru/2010/12/10/799310.html">Rosbalt</a> agency was born on this topic, curious for review.  The pace with which the rates are rising in the bidding is somewhat reminiscent of the shootouts of ‚Äúsnipers‚Äù on eBay, when the price, which remained unchanged during the week, takes a few seconds before the end of the bidding. <br><br>  More than 1,800 domain names will go to the second round, among which are: Olympiad2014.rf, Khodorkovsky.rf, porno-deti.rf, usa.rf, mmm.rf, torrent.rf, youtube.rf.  In addition, there are many trademarks in this list - nokiya.rf, opel.rf, mazda.rf, lexus.rf, panasonik.rf, facebook.rf, etc., as well as domains of state and social importance - sergiev-posad .rf, hmao.rf, tsao.rf, ossetia.rf, mgu.rf, rudn.rf and others. <br><br><h4>  Lord of the dot RF </h4><br><br>  A separate item are domains, whose status is difficult to determine, because  They were registered on the Ru-Center itself.  Or, to be precise, to the postal address of its general director, Mr. Lesnikov.  <a href="http://stat.reg.ru/domains%3Forder%3DASC%26sort_field%3Ddomain_name_idn%26tld%3Drf%26registered%3DREGISTERED%26search%3D%26create_from%3D%26create_to%3D%26till_from%3D%26till_to%3D%26owner%3D%26strict_owner%3D1%26email%3Dlad%2540nic.ru%26regfilter%3D%26rows_per_page%3D200">Full list - in the studio</a> .  A huge number of meaningful, potentially sought addresses.  The number is huge.  At the time of writing, it is 11281. Last week, meanwhile, there were 11,415. What addresses have changed the owner, under what conditions, why they were initially registered in the name of the general director of the monopolist registrar - is unknown.  Was this an attempt to protect the rightful owners from cybersquatting?  Perhaps, but in that case, where <a href="http://stat.reg.ru/domains%3Forder%3DASC%26sort_field%3Ddomain_name_idn%26tld%3Drf%26registered%3DREGISTERED%26search%3D%25EF%25EE%25F0%25ED%25EE%26create_from%3D%26create_to%3D%26till_from%3D%26till_to%3D%26owner%3D%26strict_owner%3D1%26email%3Dlad%2540nic.ru%26regfilter%3D%26rows_per_page%3D200">are the</a> addresses from this list?  Just in case, I clarify - along with these, to put it mildly, dubious names, they are registered and completely human, in demand.  For example - the <a href="http://stat.reg.ru/domains%3Forder%3DASC%26sort_field%3Ddomain_name_idn%26tld%3Drf%26registered%3DREGISTERED%26search%3D%25EA%25E0%25F4%25E5%26create_from%3D%26create_to%3D%26till_from%3D%26till_to%3D%26owner%3D%26strict_owner%3D1%26email%3Dlad%2540nic.ru%26regfilter%3D%26rows_per_page%3D200">names of the cafe</a> .  <a href="http://stat.reg.ru/domains%3Forder%3DASC%26sort_field%3Ddomain_name_idn%26tld%3Drf%26registered%3DREGISTERED%26search%3D%25F4%25E8%25EB%25FC%25EC%26create_from%3D%26create_to%3D%26till_from%3D%26till_to%3D%26owner%3D%26strict_owner%3D1%26email%3Dlad%2540nic.ru%26regfilter%3D%26rows_per_page%3D200">Or movies</a> . <br><br><h4>  Instead of epilogue </h4><br>  In no case do I claim to be an exhaustive analysis of the behavior of the Ru-Center.  Just a lot of what I saw, it seems to me outrageous.  Much - just controversial.  This, of course, is inevitable - there is a monopolist on the market, and this explains, if not everything, then in any case much. <br><br>  For me personally, there is only one moral: monopolism is bad.  But only.  He must be fought, as the majority suffers from it.  Companies suffer, ordinary Internet users suffer. <br><br>  UPDTD: Alexander Khinshtein tweets about the collection of commission on the zone. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/110066/">https://habr.com/ru/post/110066/</a></p>
