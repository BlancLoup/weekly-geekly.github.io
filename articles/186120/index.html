  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Education, work and advanced training</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Education in Russia is a very topical issue, especially in the light of recent reforms in this area.  Education becomes paid, which means high-quality IT education, which is already poorly accessible in the regions, is likely to become just a luxury.  The industry support programs work poorly, almost any attempts by the state to change the situation seem clumsy, so the community is forced to somehow organize itself.  Here and there, there are projects ‚Äúprogramming course in 10 days‚Äù, ‚Äú <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/150109/">how I became a programmer in 8 weeks</a> ‚Äù and others.  Despite the fact that for any specialist such topics are just ridiculous, in one, then in another such project you can see large companies or famous people. <br><br>  This can be assessed differently, but I see this as a desperate attempt to change the situation.  I myself am a self-taught programmer, and I know that the problem of education is not a joke.  Even after studying at a university, after five years, knowledge quickly ceases to be relevant, and where to update them?  In fact, each person is left to himself in this matter. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  A few years ago, my colleagues and I dreamed that it would be great to create a special place where programmers could have their own special world - to live and work together and learn from each other.  A place with a special atmosphere where people could come together to achieve something more.  The fantasies would have remained fantasies if one of the customers hadn‚Äôt approached me a week ago with an interesting proposal - to create a business incubator.  From the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe next business incubator, I quickly dissuaded him - there are already not a few of them, and, frankly speaking, not a lot of sense from them. <br><br>  The next concept of a special center was rather quickly formed.

    <h4>  Concept </h4><br>  We want to create a special center that would unite in itself a number of areas - training, jobs, accommodation, and some others.  The idea is to create a platform on which various courses are taught on a regular basis - from single lectures and trainings to three-month courses.  Several courses at the same time.  Fundamental sciences (mathematics, physics) and specialized (separate directions in programming, specific languages ‚Äã‚Äãand concepts). <br><br>  The center itself should consist of four main sections - the residential sector, coworking, lecture rooms and exhibition space.  A person can come to the center, he will be provided with access to all current courses, a room for living, three meals a day, a workplace with Internet access, and the opportunity to work outdoors.  The center contains everything necessary for life for a short period of time, so that a person plunges into the atmosphere of the center for 24 hours a day and can fully devote himself to learning and solving work issues, without having to be distracted by things like the way to work / home, cooking food and other. <br><br>  The center will offer both the opportunity to come to study individual courses, and passing a series of courses.  For example, the ‚Äúcourse of the young fighter‚Äù - a six-month express course of study: the foundations of mathematics, algorithms, language acquisition, practical exercises.  Also - the opportunity to simply settle, work on freelancing and catch those courses that are interesting. <br><br>  Naturally, since the project is commercial (although options can be considered) - accommodation and training will be paid.  The numbers have yet to be calculated, alas, a very large number of factors must be taken into account. <br><br>  I would also like to organize interaction with employers - so that they can search among the participants of the courses for potential employees to the office, to work remotely, or to transfer individual projects to an outsourcing center entirely.  Perhaps on the terms of exchange - they send us a specialist to read a small course, and leave with a pack of resumes, where everyone has already been interviewed. <br><br><h4>  Reality </h4><br>  The location of the center is already known, because we have already been provided with a complex of buildings for this task.  On-site overhaul, there are all communications.  It remains only to equip the premises under the task, to make cosmetic repairs.  Location: <a href="http://maps.yandex.ru/%3Ftext%3D%25D0%25A0%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F%252C%2520%25D0%2598%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F%2520%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%258C%252C%2520%25D0%25A2%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9%2520%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B9%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%252C%2520%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BA%2520%25D0%25A1%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%26sll%3D40.485049%252C56.596644%26ll%3D40.485049%252C56.596644%26spn%3D0.044031%252C0.012666%26z%3D15%26l%3Dmap">Russia, Ivanovo region, Teikovsky district, settlement Sokatovo</a> <br><br>  Externally, our future center now looks like this: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/725/441/04a/72544104a5fc6b9de7758d84f9491625.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e17/ab3/1c1/e17ab31c10a478c0312d70c19ef67fee.jpg"><br><br>  Around the fields and forests, near a small village.  To a major highway 5km, to Suzdal - 20km, to Ivanovo - 50km (there is an airport). <br>  I have only been involved in the project for a week, so we are still at a very early stage, in particular, we still have to find an investor.  Despite the fact that the project is commercial, I first of all see it as a social one. <br><br>  I want to implement the project for the developer community, and as a result, with active interaction.  For this I want to know the opinion of the community about this project.  We are just as simple developers as you, and we will be happy for any help. <br><br>  <b>UPD</b> : Photo report on the exploration of the terrain - <a href="https://vk.com/kozzztik%3Fz%3Dalbum227123_176921582">photo album VKontakte</a> . <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/186120/">https://habr.com/ru/post/186120/</a></p>
