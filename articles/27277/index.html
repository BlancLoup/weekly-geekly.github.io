One was left without a pair.  Not good.  Stood in three.  Again one - orphan.  Four and six each - it is clear that it is uneven, but then again one remains!  Then five.  The same result!  Oh, for complacency lined up by seven.  And it turned out absolutely smooth.  How many people at least were built? ‚Äù <br><br>  Task number 4 <br>  ‚ÄúThere are 2 ropes.  Each burns for 1 hour, but it burns unevenly, that is, it burns through in one hour, but it‚Äôs not a fact that 1/2 of the ropes will burn through in 30 minutes. <br>  It is necessary: ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äúmeasure out‚Äù with these ropes 45 minutes ‚Äù <br><br>  Problem number 5 <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe chief called the staff to the meeting.  Each of them, entering the office of the chief, shook hands with all those present. <br>  How many employees came to the meeting, if there were a total of 78 handshakes? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/27277/">https://habr.com/ru/post/27277/</a></p>
