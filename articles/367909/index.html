This time we invite you to see how the <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/aftershokz-trekz-titanium.html%3Futm_source%3Dgktms%26utm_medium%3Dtrekz%26utm_campaign%3Dtitanium">latest version</a> of Aftershokz‚Äôs sports headphones looks like. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/201/dfe/4e2/201dfe4e2d404e93a71f8c2e328d7fdf.JPG"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The announcement of Trekz Titanium, or rather the <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/medgadgets/blog/260588/">announcement of their campaign on Indiegogo</a> , at one time caused a lot of interest, which was expressed here - in the views, and on our side - in the applications for this version of headphones. <br><br>  Today I propose to see what happened in the end, how this version differs from other wireless models and how much it will cost in Russia.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/81c/9bd/7a9/81c9bd7a9b1547fbb8d91e5ab57481ff.jpg"><br><br>  Aftershokz is consistently improving its headset, focusing primarily on the sports audience.  Often, marketing efforts in the international market are accompanied by tragic data about cyclists and runners who have been killed and maimed on the roads.  And there is no speculation!  Indeed, in Europe and in the West, a bicycle is an actual means of transportation, but in the general stream with cars it is extremely dangerous. <br><br>  The key proposal that Aftershokz makes is: maximum control of the situation, because all headphones with bone conduction of sound do not cover the ears, and a person can listen to music or talk on the phone, while ‚Äústaying connected‚Äù with the outside world. <br><br>  The historical line today includes 6 models: 2 wired and 4 wireless, but some of them have already been discontinued. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d6d/620/328/d6d620328aa746a3bc96d035a8854ef7.jpg"><br><br>  So, for example, at CES2016 it became clear that three versions would be the key: the <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/sportz-m3-s-mikrofonom.html%3Futm_source%3Dgktms%26utm_medium%3Dtrekz%26utm_campaign%3Dsportzm3">Sportz M3</a> , the <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/aftershokzbluez-2-bluetooth.html%3Futm_source%3Dgktms%26utm_medium%3Dtrekz%26utm_campaign%3Dbluez2s">Bluez 2S</a> and - the last - the <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/aftershokz-trekz-titanium.html%3Futm_source%3Dgktms%26utm_medium%3Dtrekz%26utm_campaign%3Dtitanium">Trekz Titanium</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c34/212/8a6/c342128a6773493e816a8f4e7e98e119.jpg"><br><br>  As a small spoiler, we must add that, according to the creators, Trekz will not be the last model.  During the conversation, we clarified that it is impossible to improve the form all the time, and sooner or later Aftershokz should ‚Äúacquire‚Äù its own application?  To which we were confirmed that in one of the future versions sports headphones should be acquired with several sensors, at least with activity tracking and a heart rate monitor.  Also - the model ‚ÄúM3‚Äù should appear in the summer in a titanium version close to Trekz. <br><br>  The current Aftershokz models have consistently changed for the better. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6fb/f28/eff/6fbf28eff5214ae8adb5b2f5bcc5f73b.jpg"><br><br>  So, for starters, the Sportz 3 had a letter ‚ÄúM‚Äù, which meant an added microphone.  Then, for the second version of the Bluez, they revised the headband, ‚Äúscattering‚Äù the battery and control buttons on the sides, which made them much more comfortable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/55d/c24/af5/55dc24af514341f4b79f4b75008eb536.jpg"><br><br>  Bluez 2s came out with slightly more curved arms in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe speakers, which ensured a better fit on the head and, as a result, better audibility. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/806/d73/3cc/806d733ccc074c059bc08feed2a26681.JPG"><br><br>  And finally, Trekz Titanium: easier, more mobile, more compact, more practical! <br><br>  <b>Aftershokz Trekz Titanium</b> <br><br>  ‚ÄúLightness‚Äù is emphasized even in details, and for the first time even a ‚Äúlightweight‚Äù version of the box was created for Trekz, which does not have a top cover. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/911/aa6/bba/911aa6bba8914846a06e14a2f297ae57.jpg"><br><br>  As a transportation tool, here again, for the first time, not a bag, but a full zip bag, however, from leatherette, where not only headphones can fit, but also some small things, such as keys, bills or bundled gags.  Their presence, however, in my understanding does not agree much with the concept of "open ears." <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a13/ae5/104/a13ae5104eb444799e4aa168213c7ad6.jpg"><br><br>  Is she needed?  The question is the second.  The peculiarity of this version: "indestructibility"!  It seemed to me that they can be hidden even in a pocket without a risk to the form and design, and they stretch beyond the example of all previous models, returning to the original form. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cb9/5ae/ea3/cb95aeea354e4db5a6b63f41eeb33edd.jpg"><br><br>  The main "performance" characteristics remained unchanged: the headphones can also be controlled without attracting the phone: turn on / off, adjust the volume, answer the call, but here they came out slightly lightweight.  In Trekz Titanium removed one of the buttons.  More precisely combined the power button and increase the volume "+". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/462/76d/376/46276d3762ab4d8cbf46a28353a5a810.jpg"><br><br>  Regarding the Bluez 2s version, the number of holes has decreased: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2bb/d79/2ab/2bbd792ab98a418ab957ab12105f7219.jpg"><br><br>  The total weight varies by 8 grams: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/49c/e65/d58/49ce65d58ad7491486948c7a0290d969.jpg"><br><br>  And here is the paradox.  The tendency to relief fails when it comes to price: the cost of Trekz Titanium headphones will be more expensive than all previous versions: <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/aftershokz-trekz-titanium.html%3Futm_source%3Dgktms%26utm_medium%3Dtrekz%26utm_campaign%3Dtitanium">9,900 rubles</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/684/9d0/30a/6849d030a2c44d7f8b3673b838bbf005.jpg"><br><br>  From fun bonuses!  It was noticed that when pairing with IOS, the ‚Äúbattery‚Äù icon automatically appears, which displays the battery charge level.  On Android, this is not visible: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f72/bb5/445/f72bb544570449908905b412ea1143e9.jpg"><br><br>  <b>The stated specifications</b> : <br><br><ul><li>  Material: Premium titanium case provides durability, durability and design flexibility. </li><li>  Platform: Android, IOS, Mac, and others.

The main claims were always directed against one of the peculiarities: other users could hear at a distance what the Aftershokz carrier did.  Simply put, sound absorption at 100% bone conduction of sound did not give, which made the use of headphones not very comfortable in humans. <br><br>  Since one of the technologies, PremiumPitch has grown in version 2S to PremiumPitch +, the sound absorption characteristics have greatly improved, and those who spoke a while ago in comments to <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/medgadgets/blog/268104/">our comparison of Bluez2 and Bluez2s</a> will be interested to know. <br><br>  In short, then, in my opinion, Bluez 2S comes out on top in this parameter, overtaking even the new Trekzs.  I put all the headphones in equal conditions with the same volume, and almost from half a meter to disassemble what is playing in 2S is impossible (amateur quality, it is better to put on the headphones): <br><br>  <i>Bluez:</i> <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ogc8mpDf9MA%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjm6mLKDqwi9duHy-YxDdLHK8wdtg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <i>Bluez 2:</i> <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/uG_GUa7o0qo%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgMWK2VQHPZmz0bSjkpprbGq2KAnA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <i>Bluez 2S:</i> <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/HLnyWRXkExc%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgNTTC-kZiQ2P6AzKQMOaLRCAHZMA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <i>Trekz Titanium:</i> <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/77qnT-Nzs-Q%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgx6qFc8RRL5GmkTlmkEV2jMn8-5A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  By the way, Bluez 2S is the only model that I normally heard in the subway, but the phone at the same time turned it on at full volume and turned on the studio recording. <br><br>  <b>How it all works:</b> <br><br>  In principle, Aftershokz has never concealed the "insides" of their headsets, and we <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/medgadgets/blog/264570/">have repeatedly written about how</a> bone conduction is used and why it is used in sports, medicine, the army, and so on. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aa8/dd8/226/aa8dd82264324f94bb94cfae63c417dc.jpg"><br><br>  In this technology is used and for fun.  For example, recently, based on CES, <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/medgadgets/blog/269086/">we wrote</a> how you can listen to music through your finger, using just bone conduction technology, which was demonstrated by one of the Samsung divisions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/045/b96/d8f/045b96d8ff8e42a5882202dd8c65bff2.jpg"><br><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/aftershokz-trekz-titanium.html%3Futm_source%3Dgktms%26utm_medium%3Dtrekz%26utm_campaign%3Dtitanium">Aftershokz Trekz Titanium</a> costs <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/aftershokz-trekz-titanium.html%3Futm_source%3Dgktms%26utm_medium%3Dtrekz%26utm_campaign%3Dtitanium">9,900 rubles</a> . </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/367909/">https://habr.com/ru/post/367909/</a></p>
