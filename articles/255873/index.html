Bauman, MAI and MIIT.  Now the tutorial is open to anyone with a student ID in hand. <br><br>  Each seminar is a capacious story about the technology and the main steps in it, frequent mistakes.  He tells a practitioner who has extensive experience (and at least several completed projects) in this area.  The task - to remove the threshold of entry into the technology.  In the end, a piece of paper is given that may become a good achivka for an employer or teacher (but it has no legal value, if that).

      Here are the next ones: <br><ul><li>  April 22 - Development: how can you surprise the world? </li><li>  April 23 - Big Data.  What to do with megavolume? </li><li>  April 24 - Modern data center: a little about everything. </li><li>  April 27 - Cloud technology.  At new heights. </li><li>  April 28 - Networking: from idea to implementation. </li><li>  April 29 - Modern Robotics: how fiction becomes reality. </li><li>  April 30 - A Step From Success: A Practical Guide To Finding A Job For Students. </li></ul><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Development - April 22, Wednesday </h4><br>  Seminar on the development of corporate software from the inside.  First, let's talk a little in general - about what typical projects are, what technology stacks are used, what is the typical project life cycle and other things that come after the implementation of more than 300 projects.  The entire second half of the seminar is an example of the brightest domestic projects.  The workshop presenter, Sergey Strelkov, Head of Development, led projects for the creation of GAS Elections subsystems, the development of COIB, USE automation in 20 regions of the Russian Federation, the creation of an NSI management system in the X5 Retail group, the EDMS of Rosatom. <br><br><h4>  Big Data April 23, Thursday </h4><br>  In general, this is a seminar about the good old Data Mining, but only on large volumes and wide variety.  The story will be about the history and prospects for the development of the concept of analyzing big data in general and in Russia, how and why Big Data technologies are being used right now with examples from our experience.  And how do those who really work with big data relate to this?  Next - what are the software and hardware solutions on the market.  Real system architectures.  A working example.  Just in case, I remind you that at least one of the serious decisions is a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/croc/blog/254467/">free open source</a> , which allows you to use it for practice right away. <br><br><h4>  Modern data center: a little about everything - Friday April 24 </h4><br>  It helps to deal with the fact that such a data center, the difference between data centers, what you should pay attention to and so on.  Despite the fact that the likelihood that you personally will be designing a data center is rather small, it is worth attending a seminar at least for the sake of achivki.  The fact is that after it you will know a bunch of pitfalls from this area. <br><br><h4>  April 27 - Cloud technology.  At new heights. </h4><br>  Next, software-defined networks (SDN), software-defined data warehouses (SDS), and most importantly, why all this is necessary and why it will not be possible to remove data from the cloud from one specific client (and even to establish where they are physically stored).  There will be a demonstration of how to create a virtual machine, network in several minutes and connect it to the Internet.  Case about how one bank moved to the cloud and does not use its hardware at all.  For dessert - a story about security guards running hundreds of virtual machines to analyze the behavior of botnets.  Vladimir Krummstein, engineer-practitioner of the operation and implementation of computing systems, tells. <br><br><h4>  Building networks: from idea to implementation - April 28, Tuesday </h4><br>  Seminar in two parts - theory and practice.  First, the good old OSI model in the form of educational program and an unexpected rake that can fly to those who do not understand it.  Then - an overview of the largest vendors and their differences.  Then - analysis of interesting situations.  In the practical part of the business game.  You can also see the equipment for organizing video conferencing and even participate in the conference using your phone or tablet. <br><br>  The seminar is conducted by Andrei Tarasov (head of the network support network), he has been working with us for about 10 years, he regularly participates in projects with major providers, banks and other major customers.  Saw a lot, it is difficult to surprise. <br><br><h4>  April 29 - Modern Robotics </h4><br>  Alexander Lewandowski - CROC Project Manager for Robotics since 2011, one of the organizers of the competition of flying robots (here are a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/croc/blog/192704/">couple of</a> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/croc/blog/186740/">posts</a> ), one of the developers of the control system for UAV AEROB, GRANAD-VA 1000, BERKUT.  Microdrones systems expert.  He stood with his back to his drone with powerful aluminum screws on the tests, depicting an obstacle.  He will talk about: <br>  - Unified control system of robotic complexes <br>  - Control systems for autonomous robotic means <br>  - Machine vision systems and their features <br>  - Systems for constructing virtual 3D worlds (including for debugging robots) <br>  - Practical experience of using UAVs in robotics in the Russian Federation. <br>  The seminar will be interesting even to those who have not thought to engage the UAV, but looked in their direction.  Glory to the robots! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/adf/830/b58/adf830b585484a2ba788f7399226e643.jpeg"><br>  <i>This is what a ground control station looks like.</i> <br><br><h4>  Job search for students - April 30, Thursday </h4><br>  Useful tips on finding a job first hand.  CROC's head of work with young specialists will share petty tricks and show the process on his part.  Frequently asked questions: <br>  1. How, where and when to look for a job. <br>  2.
