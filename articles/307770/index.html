But as for recording conversations, you will almost always see that it is ‚Äúincluded in the kit.‚Äù  Today we open the veil of secrecy and tell what it means in practice. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fc9/2dd/135/fc92dd13539540508e58cc8d8557dda2.png" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The other day, one of the clients asked us a question: ‚ÄúWhat do I get as a service call recording?‚Äù.  After a lengthy conversation, we came to the conclusion that the time has come for such a post, in which we analyze the completeness of the conversation recording functionality and do not even hesitate to mention in comparison our direct competitors. <br><br>  So what's important in the case of a recording?  It seems to us that there are three areas to be highlighted - this is the available capacity, cost and convenience of working with the system.  But before we start discussing existing offers on the market, let's talk about what is common to most call recording systems. 
      <br>

    <h3>  Common features </h3><br>  After a brief analysis of the market, we came to the conclusion that for most virtual PBXs, the recording function has the option of spot tuning - that is, you can decide for yourself from which numbers you need to record conversations, and from which numbers you do not.  Similarly, the settings of the recording time parameters take place through the personal account, and this functionality is almost the same. <br><br>  Also, you will not find anywhere else to adjust the density of compression.  As a rule, operators prefer to save conversations exactly in the codec in which the conversation took place, and the sound quality is identical to the quality during a call. <br><br>  Finally, no one yet offers speech analytics services, since they require a lot of processing power and will be quite expensive.  Neither we nor other companies are doing this, but not because no one can, but because so far there is no demand for such a service as part of the service of an available cloud PBX. <br><br><h3>  Differences </h3><br>  But now let's talk about the differences, and then it will not work without going "on the individual."  We ask our competitors not to be offended by the facts, and if any of our data is outdated, just report it. <br><br>  The first is <i>completeness.</i>  Some operators include some call recording services, and they are very different from each other.  For example, there are offers on the market for "0 rubles", which may include recording conversations.  Without focusing on the fact that such kits are initially deprived of important functions that you still need to order (please treat the operator with understanding - it‚Äôs not a charity organization), they also include the function of recording conversations.  A striking example of this approach is demonstrated by Zebra Telecom.  For any version of PBX (even for free) the opportunity to record a conversation and storage for 9 GB!  It all depends on the number of serviced rooms, of which only 3 are available in the basic version. <br><br>  The second is <i>the capacity</i> .  It is far from always that free recording offers really allow you to save conversations.  For example, "MangoOffice" allows you to record about 500 minutes, and "Zadarma" - 200 Megabytes.  Agree, this is not the volume that is needed to control conversations.  Here we immodestly take off our hat and announce that Hive offers really unlimited storage for all your numbers.  Yes, it is not free, but for other operators, who provide only symbolic storage for free, you need to pay a very decent amount for real volume - you will have to pay 330 rubles a month for Telfin or, for example, 550 rubles a month for 50 GB . <br><br>  The third is <i>the number of rooms.</i>  Not every PBX supports recording on all serviced numbers.  For example, in SipUni there is licensing for paid and free numbers.  Accordingly, the record is available for administrative subscribers, but not for other users.  ‚ÄúZadarma‚Äù also by default activates the service entry for 3 numbers, but this does not mean that one or another provider cannot be recorded more - it‚Äôs just that you have to pay extra for it.  In the case of "Zadarma" - $ 1 for an additional number.  The number of numbers in Hive is not limited at all - everything that you want is recorded in any volume. <br><br>  The fourth is a <i>way to get records</i> .  For some customers there is an opportunity to save.  As a number of services offers to send entries to e-mail.  Immediately after the conversation, a letter arrives that contains a file and information about the time and date of the conversation, the number of the incoming / outgoing call.  However, not everyone has such a function, for example, Telfin provides access to records only from the cloud.  A distinctive feature of the service "Zadarma" and our Hive is the ability to pick up audio through the API for further processing somewhere else.  In particular, due to this our records can be listened to in AmoCRM, with which Hive has a tight integration. <br><br><table cellpadding="1" width="995" border="1"><tbody><tr><th>  PBX </th><th>  Min.  cost of recording per month </th><th>  For all rooms </th><th>  Capacity </th><th>  Cloud </th><th>  post office </th><th>  API </th><th>  Capacity supplement </th></tr><tr><td>  <strong>Heve</strong> </td><td>  150 </td><td>  Yes </td><td>  Unlimited </td><td>  X </td><td>  X </td><td>  X </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>  <strong>Mango Office</strong> </td><td>  700 (or 0.8 rub / min) </td><td>  Yes </td><td>  500 minutes </td><td>  X </td><td>  X </td><td></td><td>  1 GB - 100 rubles per month </td></tr><tr><td>  <strong>Zadarma</strong> </td><td>  In the package </td><td>  3 numbers + 1 $ / number </td><td>  200 MB </td><td>  X </td><td>  X </td><td>  X </td><td>  10 GB - 250 rubles / month 50 GB - 550 rubles / month </td></tr><tr><td>  <strong>Zebra</strong> </td><td>  In the package </td><td>  Yes </td><td>  9 GB </td><td>  X </td><td>  X </td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>  <strong>Telfin</strong> </td><td>  In the package </td><td>  Yes </td><td>  1000 minutes </td><td>  X </td><td></td><td></td><td>  50 GB - 330rub / month </td></tr><tr><td>  <strong>Sipuni</strong> </td><td>  In the package </td><td>  Not </td><td>  Unlimited </td><td>  X </td><td>  X </td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><h3>  Conclusion </h3><br>  As you can see, the offers on the market are very different and in addition to recording, they differ in other parameters, such as the cost per minute, the number of included calls and subscribers, the ability to work with mobile SIM-cards and so on.  But you will find all these data on the operators' websites, while not much information is available about the recording, so do not hesitate to ask the operator what services are available as part of paid and free packages today, because tariffs can change at any time . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/481/b9f/1e2/481b9f1e240b4b0b90ab83781d721fc0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Which variant of the record is more profitable depends on how important it is to you.  We offer the most versatile and complete package of services for your money, SipUni also does not limit storage, but only for ‚Äúpaid‚Äù numbers, Zebra gives the most interesting starter kit, and ‚ÄúZadarma‚Äù allows you to work with records through the API at no additional charge, but with minimum recording capacity.  And perhaps this information will help you to make a choice between almost equivalent proposals for creating a virtual PBX, if recording conversations is what is important to you. <br><br>  As for <a href="http://hive.zeonpbx.ru/">Hive</a> , we offer one of the most complete sets of services with a large number of included services, including the recording of all conversations without restrictions and completely free of charge during the first month.  Further, the service costs from 150 rubles per month, which is still cheaper than ordering any significant storage capacity from our competitors.  <a href="http://www.iptelefon.su/">IPtelefon</a> 's policy is to provide customers with balanced services that are complemented by such services as a universal <a href="http://hive.zeonpbx.ru/api/">API</a> for connecting external systems, integration with <a href="http://www.amocrm.ru/">AmoCRM</a> , and <a href="http://www.iptelefon.su/ip-sim">Multi IP-SIM</a> .  You can learn about the charms of these solutions and technologies in other posts of our <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/timata/topics/">blog</a> , as well as independently explore our offers on the website <a href="http://hive.zeonpbx.ru/">hive.zepnpbx.ru</a> and order those services that will be useful to your business. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/307770/">https://habr.com/ru/post/307770/</a></p>
