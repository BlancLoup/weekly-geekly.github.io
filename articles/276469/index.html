Welcome (but not limited to): <br><ol><li>  a statement of their own successful solution (preferably with an explanation: why this solution is good); </li><li>  a review of technology, tools and solutions (the review may be personalized); </li><li>  historical essay on the interfaces of the past and their evolution; </li><li>  information and reports on events (conferences, seminars, exhibitions) on the subject of the user interface; </li><li>  information (maybe even advertising) about your company developing user interfaces (no more than 1 page); </li><li>  personal information about you personally as a developer of user interfaces (information format - see the section ‚ÄúPersonalia‚Äù in the Ergonomist newsletter, p. 34); </li><li>  analysis of failed user interface examples (it is desirable that the example be impersonal); </li><li>  professional ads. </li></ol><br><br>  What does this give?  First, the dissemination of information among more than 300 subscribers of the newsletter - professional ergonomists and usabilityists.  Secondly, the practice of more or less strict, but at the same time popular presentation and reflection on their results. <br><br>  What will it give to our discipline?  First, if you personally respond, as well as many others, we will receive a useful exchange of information and achievements.  Secondly, this contributes to the convergence of the "traditional" ergonomists and computer usability, which, believe me, is now very necessary. <br><br>  Materials can be sent to Alexey Anokhin by e-mail <a href="">anokhin@obninsk.ru</a> with the topic: ‚ÄúErgonomist‚Äù <a href="">edition</a> on PI.
