  <section class="page js-page"><h1>NVRAM device in UEFI-compatible firmware, part four</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cac/46d/299/cac46d2997ac472c9442498fa9bd29fc.jpg">  Hello again, dear readers. <br>  Started in the <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/281242/">previous</a> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/281412/">three</a> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/281469/">parts, the</a> conversation about the storage formats of NVRAM used by different implementations of UEFI comes to its logical end.  Only one format remained unreviewed - NVAR, which is used in firmware based on the AMI Aptio code base.  At one time, AMI was able to ‚Äústraddle‚Äù almost the entire firmware market for desktop and server motherboards, so the NVAR format turned out to be almost more common than the original and ‚Äústandard‚Äù VSS. <br>  If you are wondering what makes AMI's NVRAM storage good and bad, welcome to Cat. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  <b>Disclaimer # 4</b> </h4><br>  Repetition - the <s>mother of stuttering is the</s> basis of memorization, so the author does not leave attempts to convince the reader that picking the firmware is dangerous, and before any changes you should make a backup on the programmer so that it will not be excruciatingly painful for a couple of tasks days (or weeks).  The author is still not responsible for anything other than ochepyakok, information about which can be sent to the L / S, you use this knowledge obtained reverse engineering at your own peril and risk. <br><br><h4>  <b>AMI NVAR</b> </h4><br>  Well, finally managed to get to the last in my list of storage format NVRAM, which I will call NVAR by the signature used in its header.  Unlike all the other formats described in the previous parts, NVAR data format are not stored with the volume <i>GUID FFF12B8D-7696-4C8B-A985-2747075B4F50 (EFI_SYSTEM_NV_DATA_FV_GUID</i> ), and in the usual FFS-file GUID <i>CEF5B9A3-476D-497F-9FDC -E98143E0422C</i> (NVAR_STORE_FILE_GUID) or <i>9221315B-30BB-46B5-813E-1B1BF4712BD3</i> (NVAR_EXTERNAL_DEFAULTS_FILE_GUID). <br>  The file with the first GUID is stored in a separate volume specially designed for NVRAM, most often there are two such volumes - primary and backup, and if something happens with the data or the primary format and the NVRAM driver can determine this, it switches to using backup storage .  Sometimes backup storage is filled at the assembly stage of the firmware, but more often space is simply left for it, and it is created during the first start (therefore, the first start after updating the firmware can be quite long).  The second file is stored in the DXE volume, has a slightly different platform-specific format, and is used to restore the defaults of some variables if both the main and the additional storage are corrupted unrecoverable. <br><br>  Since the data in NVAR format is stored inside the file, information about the maximum storage size and where to find it is already available to the firmware due to the UEFI <abbr title="Firmware file system">FFS</abbr> services, therefore the AMI developers did not invent any additional headers immediately after the header with maximum packaging and without alignment, NVAR recordings begin.

      The title of this entry looks like this: <br><pre><code class="cpp hljs"><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">struct</span></span></span><span class="hljs-class"> </span><span class="hljs-title"><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-title">NVAR_ENTRY_HEADER</span></span></span><span class="hljs-class"> {</span></span> UINT32 Signature; <span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment">//  NVAR UINT16 Size; //      UINT32 Next : 24; //     , //    (0  0xFFFFFF   ErasePolarity) UINT32 Attributes : 8; //   };</span></span></code> </pre> <br>  He is on the screenshot: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c7f/6a9/7a8/c7f6a97a8c284a7eaffc517a1d73ce70.png"><br>  Everything looks very simple at first; the first <font color="red">signature</font> is NVAR, then <font color="orange">the record size</font> is 0x5D3, the blank <font color="green">field is Next</font> , the <font color="lightblue">attributes</font> are 0x83, the incomprehensible <font color="blue">eight-bit field</font> is 0x00, and <font color="purple">the variable name</font> in ASCII is <i>StdDefaults</i> . <br><br>  It turns out that the data format of the data strongly depends on the bits of the <i>Attributes</i> field, which can be represented as follows: <pre> <code class="cpp hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">enum</span></span> NVAR_ENTRY_ATTRIBUTES { RuntimeVariable = <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0x01</span></span>, <span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment">// ,     (       ) ,   RT AsciiName = 0x02, //     ASCII  UCS2 LocalGuid = 0x04, // GUID     ,          GUID DataOnly = 0x08, //     ,         ExtendedHeader = 0x10, //   ,      HwErrorRecord = 0x20, // ,     (       ) ,   HW AuthWrite = 0x40, // ,     (       ) , //   AV / TA EntryValid = 0x80 //  ,     ,     };</span></span></code> </pre><br>  Thus, our 0x83 <font color="lightblue">attributes</font> are in fact <i>EntryValid</i> + <i>AsciiName</i> + <i>RuntimeVariable</i> , and the previously unknown <font color="blue">eight-bit field</font> is an <font color="blue">index in the GUID database</font> .  I also note that the length of the name is not stored anywhere, and in order to find the beginning of the data, you need to call <i>strlen ()</i> every time.  If the LocalGuid attribute were set, instead of a 1-byte index, the entire GUID would be present at 16. It turns out that the GUID database is in the database (I‚Äôll reveal a secret, it is at the very end of the file and grows up, that is, our null GUID is the last 16 a byte of the file with NVRAM storage, the first is the penultimate 16 bytes and so on) no more than 256 different GUIDs can be stored, but this is enough for any possible NVRAM applications at the moment, and it saves a lot of space. <br><br>  The same from the <a href="https://github.com/LongSoft/UEFITool/tree/new_engine">UEFITool NE</a> window: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3df/466/401/3df466401994408db73b133daf242ab7.png"><br><br>  The attribute values ‚Äã‚Äãshow how the format has evolved over time.  Prior to UEFI 2.1, variable NVRAM had only 3 possible attributes: <abbr title="Non-volatile">NV</abbr> , <abbr title="BootServices-accessible">BS</abbr> , <abbr title="Runtime-accessible">RT</abbr> .  The NV attribute is meaningless to store, because  Only such variables in the NVRAM repository both fall, and BS and RT are not mutually exclusive, and a healthy change can have either BS or BS + RT, so only one bit was used for these attributes ‚Äî <i>RuntimeVariable</i> .  Great, it turned out to save as much as 24 bits per variable. <br>  Then it turned out that the physical level of NVRAM is not always reliable, and it would be necessary to read the checksum from the data in order to distinguish the damaged variables from the normal ones, so the <i>ExtendedHeader</i> bit was <i>entered</i> , and the checksum was stored at the very end of the record, after the data. <br>  It took some time, and under pressure from Microsoft, another attribute was added to UEFI 2.1 - <abbr title="Hardware Error Record">HW</abbr> , used for <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff559331(v%3Dvs.85).aspx">WHEA</a> variables.  Well, under it brought a bit <i>HwErrorRecord</i> , it is necessary so it is necessary. <br>  Then, in UEFI 2.3.1C, SecureBoot was unexpectedly added along with two new attributes for variables - <abbr title="Authenticated Variable">AV</abbr> and <abbr title="Append Write">AW</abbr> .  Fortunately, storing the latter is not very necessary (because there is only one such variable, <i>dbx</i> ), and the last free bit of <i>AuthWrite</i> had to be allocated to the first <i>one</i> . <br>  It turned out to be quite short-lived, already in UEFI 2.4 another attribute was added - <abbr title="Time-based Authentication">TA</abbr> , which, suddenly, turned out to have nowhere to pop, because  at one time saved as much as 24 bits.  As a result, I had to start an additional field in the extended header, which is stored after the data.  There also had to store a timestamp and a hash for AV / TA variables. <br><br>  After all these improvements, the extended title turned out like this: <pre> <code class="cpp hljs"><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">struct</span></span></span><span class="hljs-class"> </span><span class="hljs-title"><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-title">NVAR_EXTENDED_HEADER</span></span></span><span class="hljs-class"> {</span></span> UINT8 ExtendedAttributes; <span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment">//    // UINT64 TimeStamp; // ,  ExtendedAttributes | ExtTimeBased (0x20) // UINT8 Sha256Hash[32]; // ,  ExtendedAttributes | ExtAuthWrite (0x10) //  ExtendedAttributes | ExtTimeBased (0x20) // UINT8 Checksum; // ,  ExtendedAttributes | ExtChecksum (0x01) UINT16 ExtendedDataSize; //     ExtendedAttributes };</span></span></code> </pre><br>  He is on the screenshot: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bce/e96/dbb/bcee96dbb4404f78a670a562d1f9b3cf.png"><br>  Total, the <font color="red">size of the extended header</font> is 0x2C, the <font color="orange">checksum</font> is 0x10, the zero <font color="green">hash</font> , the <font color="lightblue">timestamp</font> is 0x5537BB5D and the <font color="blue">attributes</font> are 0x21 ( <i>ExtChecksum</i> + <i>ExtTimeBased</i> ). <br><br>  It turns out that in order to get the value of attributes for any variable, it must be disassembled all in its entirety, calculating displacements dynamically and collecting values ‚Äã‚Äãfrom several different places in the file.  And all this is exactly because once a long time ago they saved as much as 24 bytes.  You will develop your format - do not save on matches, do yourself a favor from the future! <br><br>  But that's not all, because we still have not considered the <i>DataOnly</i> attribute and the <i>Next</i> field in the header.  They are used to save on GUIDs, names and attributes, if the variable to which you are writing to already exists.  Instead of removing the <i>EntryValid</i> attribute from the old record and writing a new one entirely, the Next field is filled in the header of the old record, and an entry is created in the empty space of the file with the <i>DataOnly</i> attribute to which this <i>Next itself</i> refers, and there is no GUID anymore No name, but there is an extended header.  Moreover, when the value of a variable is rewritten next time, the <i>Next</i> field is not corrected in the first record in this unique, simply-connected list, but in the last one, by extending the list.  And since  there are variables that are updated each time you reboot (yes the same <i>MonotonicCounter</i> ), very soon NVRAM is filled with data of this variable to the edges, and access to it slows down with each reboot until it turns out that there is no space at all and the NVRAM driver needs to be assembled garbage.  Why this is done is another great mystery; I cannot think of a good reason for such behavior. <br><br>  In UEFITool NE, we had to add the <i>Go to data</i> action, which works on variables of type <i>Link</i> (that is, those with a <i>Next</i> field that is not empty) and selects the last element in a simply linked list, which stores the current data of the variable, and not those were there the devil knows when before: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0a9/355/850/0a9355850d1142eaa6d3662ca999cd53.png"><br><br>  Access to variables NVRAM works <i>like this</i> on 95% of desktops and servers of the last 5 years.  Look, dear readers, to what the savings in bytes and the hanging of the old format with new crutches bring in a desperate attempt not to rewrite the NVRAM driver again, and do not do so, please. <br><br><h4>  <b>Conclusion</b> </h4><br>  I do not know what to say about NVAR format.  In pursuit of AMI compactness, they managed to sacrifice everything else, and if at first it seemed that this sacrifice was small and imperceptible, with the development of the UEFI specification, the format turned into a local analogue of <a href="http://wowwiki.wikia.com/wiki/Abomination_(Warcraft_III)">Abomination</a> ', assembled from pieces of unclearly what, stitched together, it is unclear how.  We were all lucky that AMI's NVRAM driver is good enough to clean up garbage in time and quietly, switch to backup storage when the main one is damaged, start with a destroyed NVRAM, relive the recording ‚Äúright up to the cover‚Äù, etc., but this has been achieved all rather not thanks, but in spite of. <br>  The story of NVRAM formats, I hope, has come to an end, now you know about them almost as much as I myself.  Thank you very much for your attention, successful firmware, chips and NVRAMs. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/281901/">https://habr.com/ru/post/281901/</a></p>
