  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Invest T3 in SEO in copywriter: free, without registration, without SMS</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e34/dc4/90e/e34dc490e3114d9f8fba2b29b42c627e.jpg"><br><br>  We believe that the followers of Ashmanov and Rosenthal can understand each other and find a common language.  The optimizer and copywriter Take the Cake have gathered specifically for this to discuss the terms of reference for an SEO copywriter that will suit everyone - by the number of occurrences of keywords and common sense. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  All optimizers want to promote sites with excellent content, and all copywriters want to deal with professional and sensitive optimizers.  Such fateful meetings are rare: someone wants to be in the TOP and will sacrifice everything for the sake of it, even through the eyes of their clients;  someone writes selling texts, but for the 15th page of issue;  and someone doesn't need a copywriter at all, because he is a doorway. <br>  Unfortunately (and perhaps fortunately), the person who is best at SEO is the optimizer - he rarely writes texts.  His task is to find a copywriter, enough to bend under the requirements of SEO, but retaining the boldness is appropriate to go against the TK and offer creative solutions.  The task of the copywriter is to speak both in the language of people and in the language of machines, like Neo from the ‚ÄúMatrix‚Äù. <br>  But imagine that the situation is very bad, and you need to promote the site.  What should the TK look like for an SEO copywriter so that even the dumb optimizer gets the result he needs? <br><table><tbody><tr><td>  <strong>How sees the TZ optimizer</strong> </td><td>  <strong>How TK sees a copywriter</strong> </td></tr><tr><td>  Ekaterina Ivanova Head of Search Marketing </td><td>  Ekaterina Aryko Head of Content Marketing </td></tr><tr><td>  <strong>Keyword Density</strong> </td><td>  <strong>Keyword Density</strong> </td></tr><tr><td>  Usually it is expressed as a percentage, it is believed that 2% is ideal (about 2-3 occurrences of the request for 800 characters).  But everything is individual, depending on the subject, on the frequency of the key.  I recommend focusing on the key density of competitors in the TOP-10 by the checked requests.  Manually difficult, but effective, as you see exactly what the search engine likes.  One of the supporting tools is Rookee.  It shows statistics on 10 competitors, but there are also errors, for example, competitors were incorrectly chosen (it‚Äôs so strange for an online store to compete with Wikipedia). <br>  If you really need to know how many key entries to hang in grams, the BM25 formula will help you.  It is believed that it allows you to calculate the ideal ratio, although, again, much depends on the subject. <br>  If the project specification is not a one-time project, but implies long-term cooperation with one copywriter, you should show him the TOP-10 sites that the optimizer or analyst considers strong.  So a copywriter can see what customers like (or can like). <br>  Be sure to clarify that if a copywriter deliberately fails to fulfill the requirements for the percentage of occurrences, he should offer something very, very good and selling in return. <br>  Text 800-3000 characters </td><td>  You must comply with the amount of text 800-3000 + characters (it all depends on the theme and type of site, but these are the most common parameters). <br>  It seems to be a matter of course, but ... <br>  If a copywriter is a young and promising specialist, it is better to explain the number of characters ‚Äúon the shore‚Äù: you can explain in advance which article is a brief note and which is a detailed lecture on the topic. </td></tr><tr><td>  <strong>Observance of morphology</strong> </td><td>  <strong>Observance of morphology</strong> </td></tr><tr><td>  One clean entry + 1 diluted.  It is desirable that the key requests are in the heading and subtitles of the text, as well as in the first paragraphs of the material.  In addition to exact entries, you need to use synonyms and word forms, as well as to combine key queries among themselves.  Each key request must be present in one form or another in the text at least 2 times.  Placing the same key request in two paragraphs in a row is prohibited.  Separation of passages by commas and unions is allowed. </td><td>  I see this phrase in every TZ, I know by heart and read for fun each time with a new intonation. <br>  What you need to convey to the copywriter: the text that meets this requirement should not resemble the creation of Victor Frankenstein, and key inquiries should not act as sores on your warm literary masterpiece.  Easy to weave into the text accurate and inaccurate entries - a skill that ultimately determines the skill of an SEO copywriter. </td></tr><tr><td>  <strong>Presence of thematic words</strong> </td><td>  <strong>Presence of thematic words</strong> </td></tr><tr><td>  It is important that the text contains not only key requests, but also thematic terms similar to them, for example, if you have a text for the query ‚Äúwebsite optimization‚Äù, then it must contain the words ‚Äúranking factors‚Äù, ‚Äúorganic delivery‚Äù . </td><td>  I would take this point to the very beginning - the stage when a copywriter should spend several hours or days diving into topics.  Successful completion of the stage guarantees the appearance of thematic words in the text. </td></tr><tr><td>  <strong>For 1000 words - 1 list + 1 picture</strong> </td><td>  <strong>For 1000 words - 1 list + 1 picture</strong> </td></tr><tr><td>  This shows the search engine robot that you have a diverse and structured content, which means that you are adding not just a canvas of text to promote, but take care of your visitors.  In addition, unique illustrations are also involved in promoting the site in the categories of Yandex Pictures and Google Pictures. </td><td>  A picture is a reasonable requirement: a modern reader is not able to read even 500 characters without a picture.  Let TK contains recommendations for choosing an image: a photo or illustration, a graphic or demotivator, a press portrait or a reportage shot. <br>  Lists - a moot point.  Specify the copywriter that this list should be very useful to the reader, perhaps it will be copied or sent to a friend.  Otherwise, the list will look like a list attempt. </td></tr><tr><td>  <strong>Work with stop words</strong> </td><td>  <strong>Work with stop words</strong> </td></tr><tr><td>  Avoid popular phrases and introductory constructs that are not analyzed by search engines when indexing texts and ranking sites.  This includes all service parts of speech, introductory constructions, etc. The maximum allowable content of stop words is 30%. </td><td>  It's great when cars and people understand each other.  Ideally, the concentration bar of stop words can be omitted to 10-15%, because most of them are not only search, but also information noise.  And almost always give the text a touch of bureaucracy. </td></tr><tr><td>  <strong>Natural relink</strong> </td><td>  <strong>Natural relink</strong> </td></tr><tr><td>  Optimizers are asked to use phrases for good linking to make it look as organic as possible.  The ratio of anchor and bezakorny links 1: 3. </td><td>  If the link is out of place (from the point of view of the reader), then with very little probability it will be boring or single-word.  But if the text is written for highly competitive topics, where every factor is important, it is better to ask the optimizer for a clear reference list with a list of anchors. </td></tr><tr><td>  <strong>Originality of the text</strong> </td><td>  <strong>Originality of the text</strong> </td></tr><tr><td>  It is difficult to write something important about a dress for a huge catalog or car tires.  Therefore, in exceptional cases, a minimum of 75% originality of the text is allowed.  For everything else, 90%. </td><td> The more the copywriter thinks about the text, the higher the percentage of originality of the text becomes.  Find a new approach or feed can be almost always - it would be time and payment.  By the way, non-original parts (modifications, specifications, manufacturer notes) can simply be closed from indexing. </td></tr></tbody></table><br>  This article also has a picture and a list, and when you fill it in, you will have on your hands a working, clear and precise TOR, according to which it will be easy to evaluate the result. <br><br><ol><li>  The site and its page for which the text is written.  It is desirable to highlight the main differences of the company from competitors, strengths and features of positioning.  If necessary, provide the worst and best examples from the industry. </li><li>  Type of text: selling, informational, entertaining.  Goals: sales, comments, reposts and likes, activation of interest to other sections of the site, etc. </li><li>  Subject text. </li><li>  Tasks to be solved by the text: to give an idea about the company, to talk about the service, to instruct on the use of the goods, to advise, etc. </li><li>  The division of content into blocks.  It's great if you can write down the approximate structure of the future text: leads (and their number, if different liners are required for announcements outside the site), key theses of the main part, call to action. </li><li>  Emphasis on uniqueness.  Ideally, of course, 100%, but the themes are different.  So, for example, what is fundamentally new to write about starters?  In such cases, lower the bar to 75%.  To verify the uniqueness, I recommend the program Yazzle or the content-watch.ru service. </li><li>  The volume of the text is a certain critical threshold, above which one cannot objectively slip. </li><li>  Key phrases - how, where and how many times should be used.  After submitting the text, the optimizer must check it for the execution of the TOR, so ask copywriters to highlight or emphasize the occurrence of key requests to make them easier to count and check the correctness of use. </li><li>  Mandatory addition of text to the program from Yandex "Original Texts" before being posted on the site.  This is a small guarantee that the authorship will be assigned to you.  After posting, make a link to the text in G +, thereby confirming the authorship in the eyes of Google. </li></ol></div>
