And I conceived the idea to talk with this legendary IT pioneer.  Well, in order to wind up the importance and significance, I offered Alan Kay an interview on behalf of the entire Russian IT community.  He agreed.  (And now Alan Kay knows that Habr is cool!)

It turned out to be quite a fun and interesting quest.  And a kind of test for one's own / someone else's, for knowledge of the history of IT, for adequacy, for the coherence of the IT community, for the ability to communicate (I have minus three friends on Facebook), for the ability of organizations / communities to perform as a whole.  Many thanks to those who passed this ‚Äútest‚Äù. <br><br>  There were 61 questions.  Alan did not answer everything, but the numbering remained original, for the convenience of version synchronization. <br><br>  <i>Special thanks to Danil Kornev, Alexander Kozlov and Sergey Danshin for the translation.</i>  <i>If you have recommendations how to translate any semantic block better - write in a personal.</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/3d2/179/7b0/3d21797b0e8f41f2ab85d4d930d58373.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Alan Kay:</b> Wow, so many questions !!!  Even for someone who loves answering questions!  Perhaps it will take me a few weeks to answer all your questions, and even after that it‚Äôs not a fact that I will answer all of them!  There are some particularly good questions, and the most difficult to answer them (and I will answer them one of the last). <br><br><h2>  MagisterLudi </h2>  <i>(future thinker, sci-fi analyst, information and IT revolution researcher, IT-journalist)</i> <br><br><h3>  Question 1 </h3><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">original</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  1) You can read a lot of books (about 300 per year).  How do you choose them?  How do you organize your personal knowledge? <br><br>  These days I read fewer books a year - perhaps 2-3 per week.  I want to organize my head.  (I would like to work). ()  I didn‚Äôt care much about my notebooks. <br><br></div></div><br>  <b>- You said that you read a lot of books (about 300 per year).</b>  <b>How do you choose them?</b>  <b>How do you organize your knowledge (diaries, mindmaps, or just keep everything in mind)?</b> <br><br>  - In recent years, I read not so many books - perhaps 2-3 per week.  And I do not organize anything, because I want the maximum of what I read to be remembered and connected with what is already in my head (although at some point I will be too old for this).  Periodically, I make notes in notebooks, but more so just to remember something and "save" in my head.  I rarely re-read these notes. <br><br><h3>  Question 2 </h3><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">original</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  2) Xerox PARC (reading, individual thinking, playing golf, drinking beer together, mindstorms, hackathons)? <br><br>  At the ARPA-IPTO research community, we generated many great ideas.  It‚Äôs a good idea to have a lot of ideas. for this).  The day to day ‚Äúgood ideas‚Äù can be a few times a month.  In our group at PARC there is a lot of beer drinking, biking, tennis, and ‚Äúrecreational coding‚Äù. </div></div><br>  <b>- What is the most productive format for learning and generating ideas that you and the coolest engineers from Xerox PARC used (reading, individual reflections, playing golf, barking beer with the whole crowd, brainstorming, hakathons)?</b> <br><br>  First, most of the founders of PARC came from the research community formed at the IPTO at ARPA, where many exciting ideas were invented since 1962.  Most of the ideas are medium, if not worse, so two heuristics are important - you need (a) to have a lot of ideas, and (b) to have a way to prevent their repetition and uncontrolled growth (writing ideas into notebooks is a good solution).  As a result, good ideas will appear somewhere a couple of times in a month.  At PARC, we talked a lot with each other - drank beer, rode bicycles, played tennis, and engaged in ‚Äúhealth coding.‚Äù <br><br><h3>  Question 3 </h3><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">original</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  3) Who inspired you in childhood (scientists, discoverers, philosophers)? <br><br>  Scientists, science fiction writers, musicians, artists, other thinkers.  Examples are: Einstein, Robert Heinlein, Bach, Michelangelo, Vermeer, Bertrand Russell. </div></div><br>  <b>- Who was an example for you in childhood (scientists, discoverers, philosophers)?</b> <br><br>  - Scientists, science-fiction writers, musicians, actors, and other thinkers.  For example: Einstein, Robert Heinlein, Bach, Michelangelo, Vermeer, Bertrand Russell. <br><br><h3>  Question 4 </h3><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">original</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  4) What are your favorite Sci-Fi books?  Do you read books of Strugatsky brothers?  (If yes, please share your thoughts and ideas.) <br><br>  There are so many favorites - so will come back to this. </div></div><br>  <b>- What is your favorite science fiction book?</b>  <b>Have you read the works of the Strugatsky?</b>  <b>(If yes, then share your thoughts on these works.)</b> <br><br>  - I do not know how best to answer this questions - too many favorite writers - I will return to this question. <br><br><h3>  Question 9 </h3><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">original</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  9) How much did you want to devote to thinking ‚Äúin future‚Äù (10%, 40%, 70%?).  ‚ÄúThink about the future from the future.‚Äù games)? <br><br>  (And don't know how to).  But it‚Äôs always a matter of fact. - and, the way I want to think - there is a lot of overlap between these two areas. <br><br>  I am pretty sure that I‚Äôm pretty much 24 hours a day.  You probably spend about 3-4 hours a day trying to help. <br><br>  ‚ÄúRelaxing‚Äù helps a lot.  It is a very important way to learn.  Dealing with the many kinds of ‚Äúblindnesses‚Äù we all have is another important set of skills.  It is not a good idea. on the back of the stove for awhile). <br><br>  If you want to see it, it‚Äôs not. </div></div><br>  <b>- How much time do you allocate to thoughts about the future / of the future (10%, 40%, 70%)?</b>  <b>Can you give a couple of practical advice to people who want to pump their ability to ‚Äúthink about the future from the future‚Äù (maybe read more science fiction, or, conversely, more historical books, or play old computer games)?</b> <b><br></b> <br><br>  I do not think about all possible types of the future (and indeed I have no idea how to do this).  What really matters to me is a list of those or other "problems."  For example - ‚Äúwhat needs to be done so that people of tomorrow can think better than people of today‚Äù?  ‚ÄúHow can we better understand and create systems of any type?‚Äù  These two problems are highly interrelated, in my opinion. <br><br>  I am quite sure that this process of thinking takes place constantly in my head 24 hours a day.  Perhaps, I spend 3-4 hours a day actively thinking and working on things that allow me to better understand my list of ‚Äúproblems‚Äù. <br><br>  "Leisure" helps a great deal.  One of the very useful skills is the ability to be very critical, and, at the same time, not to succumb to depression.  Another skill is to be able to work with different types of so-called.  "Blindness."  Most ideas are very mediocre, if not worse.  At the same time, to be critical, you can skip potentially good ideas ‚Äî and let ideas run like a stream, and write down those that look promising (methodologically, it‚Äôs better not to take good ideas right away ‚Äî you need to put them off for a while to come to when it becomes clearer that they are really good). <br><br>  You can draw an analogy with night vision (the eye is more sensitive outside the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A6%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D1%258F%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0">central fossa of the</a> retina) - if you want to look at a star, then it is better to look not at it itself, but at its edges. <br><br><h2>  Danila Kornev </h2>  <i>(CEO, Zet Universe, Post-PC devices).

For example, the Sketchpad was not only the first modern interactive graphics system. But it also had a zoomable interface.  Nicholas Negroponte‚Äôs ‚ÄúArch-Mac‚Äù research group for the ‚ÄúSpatial Data Management System‚Äù. </div></div><br>  <b>‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt think that innovation in digital workflows is over, what do you think of zoomed user interfaces as the basis for alternative digital work environments?‚Äù</b>  <b>(Zoom user interfaces were promoted by Jeff Raskin himself, and today we have a lot of 2-in-1 form factor tablets, and there is an augmented reality, where natural user interfaces rely on spatial memory).</b> <br><br>  - The zoomed user interfaces were born long before Jeff Raskin (he was not very attentive to documenting the sources of his ideas).  For example, Sketchpad was not only the first modern interactive graphics system (and this was in 1962, the year!), But it also had a zummed interface.  Another very important example is the early zoomed graphical interface developed by the Arch-Mac Nicholas Negroponte group in the 1970s for the Spatial Data Management System project. <br><br><h2>  Danila Medvedev </h2>  <i>(Applied futurologist, immortality, cryonics, Intelligence amplification)</i> <br><br><h3>  Question 14 </h3><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">original</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  14) Overlapping windows ... this is what you need to make.  Do you need to overlapping windows? <br>  If you have a big display surface.  It was an overwhelming idea.  It is not clear how much it can be resolved.  Another point is that ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not Big Data that‚Äôs important but Big Meaning!‚Äù </div></div><br>  <b>‚ÄúOnce overlapping windows were a useful invention, but today, when we work with huge amounts of information, overlapping windows make it difficult to organize information in the workspace.</b>  <b>What prospects do you see in solving this problem of ‚Äúoverlapping windows‚Äù?</b> <br><br>  - If you have a huge display surface - real or virtual - then you do not need overlapping windows.  Initially, our idea was to solve the problem of very small screens - overlapping windows on them were a great solution.  ‚ÄúHuge amounts of information‚Äù cannot be dealt with by simply enlarging screens (after all, information objects must fit within the scope of what the human brain can simultaneously realize and understand).  And one more thing - Big Data is not as important as Big Meaning. <br><br><h3>  Question 15 </h3><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">original</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  15) What are your primary working tools? <br><br>  My primary working tools, especially with drawing.  It has been taken for a few seconds. at people who can really draw. <br><br>  The next level is books and reading in general.  Again, industry paper.  It can be read. <br><br>  It is a good idea to find out about it. <br><br>  I need to play music every day. </div></div><br>  <b>- What tools form your personal workspace on the computer?</b> <br><br>  ‚ÄúMy main work tools are all that lies between my ears and my hands, especially when it comes to drawing.‚Äù  (even during the development of the Dynabook concept, I said that the tablet should have a pen, and it should support drawing, and I was deeply distressed by how long it took the industry to do at least this, and at least on tablet PCs) .  And the level of support for drawing, which is in the tablets, it does not reach the level of those who really know how to draw. <br><br>  At the next level, we have books and reading in general.  And again, the industry has not yet produced anything as easy to read as ordinary paper.  What the industry has managed to do is not very convenient for those who like to read. <br><br>  Even higher in the list of my tools for work is a comfortable sofa - you can stretch out on it, read and write. <br><br>  I need to play a musical instrument every day. <br><br><h3>  Question 16 </h3><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">original</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  16) Aren't you disappointed with what computers turned into: games, porn, twitter, etc.? <br><br>  I'm disappointed with the combination of the consumer and the very poor education system.  Computers are the instruments for music with the best violins, etc.  or the most beautiful music.  Humans. <br><br>  And see the answer to 15. <br></div></div><br>  <b>‚ÄúAre you not disappointed with what computers have become?‚Äù</b>  <b>Toys, porn, twitter and so on?</b> <br><br>  - I am disappointed with consumer businesses and a very, very bad educational system.  Computers can be compared to musical instruments, their music is ideas;  As you know, you can manage to get terrible sounds, even when using the world's best violin, and you can play the most unusual piece of music.  So, you should stick your finger at the users themselves. <br><br>  See the answer to question ‚Ññ15. <br><br><h3>  Question 17 </h3><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">original</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  17) Doug Engelbart human intellect including group intellect.  Why was he ultimately denied a chance to fulfill his vision of augmentation? <br><br>  Doug was denied a chance.  It was Doug helped create. <br></div></div><br>  <b>- Douglas Engelbart dreamed of using computers to enhance human intelligence, including collective intelligence.</b>  <b>Why wasn't he given the chance to realize his concept of reinforcement?</b> <br><br>  - I do not think that Dagu something forbidden.  There were several problems, including those mentioned in the answer to the 16th question.  Most people didn‚Äôt understand why personal computers were invented, not to mention the great ideas that Doug helped bring to life. <br><br><h3>  Question 18 </h3><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">original</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  18) Did OLPC achieve all goals that you envisioned for DynaBook in terms of pedagogy? <br><br>  Not even close. <br></div></div><br>  <b>- Has the OLPC project achieved all the pedagogical tasks that you set in the days of DynaBook?</b> <br><br>  ‚ÄúNot even close by.‚Äù <br><br><h3>  Question 19 </h3><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">original</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  19) What are the next steps for the OLPC project? <br><br>  It is worthwhile.  The next few years could be another one. </div></div><br>  <b>- What awaits OLPC in the future?</b> <br><br>  - For me, it would be a great idea to repeat a project of this kind every 10-15 years.  In a few years it will be the most it will start a new such project. <br><br><h3>  Question 20 </h3><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">original</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  20) What did you manage to do, where you failed? <br><br>  This question I don't quite understand.  But the main idea is to ‚Äúkeep on keeping on‚Äù </div></div><br>  <b>- What did you achieve in the OLPC project, and where did you fail?</b> <br><br>  - Honestly, I did not quite understand this question.  But the basic idea is simple - you need to continue to "continue." <br><br><h2>  Anatoliy levenchuk </h2>  <i>(scientific advisor, System Management School)</i> <br><br><h3>  Question 21 </h3><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">original</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  21) There were major changes in connectivity modeling.  If you still have the computer computer?  Connectivity-based computing? <br><br>  - I do not think I understand the first question.  Correlation modeling, for example, correlation modeling just reactions.  (Minsky's ‚ÄúSociety of Mind‚Äù book is still a good guide to all of these different paradigms.) <br><br>  To me, it‚Äôs a classic computer revolution.  In other words, it is ‚Äúmuch better‚Äù than what was happening with most human development.  (I would like to talk about retrograde communication.) </div></div><br>  <b>- Over the past five years, connective modeling has taken a huge step forward.</b>  <b>Does Alan Kay consider that this is part of the next computer revolution that has finally begun, or is he still waiting for the classical computer revolution (which will not start at all) and would not mix symbolist and connectionist computing?</b> <br><br>  - I think I did not quite understand the first question.  As for the second, then, I think, for any kind of so-called.  ‚ÄúCorrelation modeling‚Äù (such as neural networks, ‚Äúdeep learning‚Äù, etc.) it is very important to be paired with ‚Äúcognitive modeling‚Äù, which uses reflective models and knowledge simulations, rather than just reactions.  (Minsky‚Äôs Society of Mind is still a great introduction to all the paradigms of this kind). <br><br>  For me, the classic computer revolution lies in the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãnot just giving a person a set of tools that strengthen the human mind, but also help better shape the human mind.  In other words, what happens ‚Äúbetween the ears‚Äù plays a very important role - and so on.  The pioneers wanted to improve these processes in comparison with everything that mankind had during most of its history.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> (I would say that today what is happening ‚Äúbetween the ears‚Äù in people who, for the most part, use computers for entertainment and social communications, can be called ‚Äúretrograde‚Äù. </font></font><br><br><h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Question 22 </font></font></h3><br><div class="spoiler"> <b class="spoiler_title"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">original</font></font></b> <div class="spoiler_text"> 22) What's your take on Julia programming language as the next gen scientific computing programming language, coming after Fortran-Matlab-Python? <br><br> ‚Äî I don't know how to criticize a language that has lots of features without trying to do a major project in it (and I haven't tried Julia).

People voice various significant risks of emergent technologies such as autonomous robotics and machine learning, from massive global destruction of jobs to civilizational existential risks. Yes, these threats have been with us for a while (similar discussions occurred even in early 1970s), but now they are evident and accumulating. In this context, suppose we talk of ¬´positive¬ª future scenarios in which humans and technosphere do not compete with each other, but coexist and cocreate in positive and productive ways. What are your top picks for ¬´skills for complex society¬ª (individual and maybe collective) that need to developed massively, in order to increase the probability of this scenario, and for humanity to realize the opening opportunity for evolutionary leap forward? <br><br> I think an approach to this question might best start with the amount of new clean energy (both with regard to emissions and to heat created) that can be made available via science and technology.

What would be the main avenues for future development of interfaces (and maybe complementary skills of children and adults?) that would help complete this unfinished revolution? As part of the question: what do you think of the potential of neural interfaces? Do you envisage them as one of the indispensable components of human-machine interfaces as the complexity of social life and technosphere increases further into 21st century? <br><br> I don't view neural interfaces as indispensable (first we need to get human brain-minds working better, etc.) The current day shows us what improved communications technologies wind up being used for if humans aren't helped to improve their brain-minds! <br><br> Both Doug and I (and others) thought then that enormous changes to general education would be needed to make use of the new tools and media (what would a person use a violin for if they didn't learn how to play it?) <br><br> And, given that, it's clear that what his and my groups did 40-50 years ago was just a bare start at what's needed.

And, as you have yourself stated in one of your interviews, ¬´music is not in the piano¬ª, it is not the matter of technologies but of the way in which they are applied.

(And some of the instruments happened because of some of the new possibilities for music in the minds of the composers!) It's hard to think about any of these areas without considering how co-evolution of ideas, works, tools, and media all intertwine. <br><br> Many of the inventions that contribute to ‚Äúcivilization‚Äù are ‚Äúanti-genetic‚Äù in several senses (a) they are not found ‚Äúnaturally‚Äù in traditional cultures, and (b) they often oppose a genetic tendency that is thought to be natural (for example: revenge, inequality, etc.) <br><br> If we look for ‚Äúnatural things‚Äù that get us into trouble, we can find many: for example: stories, desire for status and power, envy, desires for revenge, etc. Take a look at Anthropology's list of several hundred ‚Äúhuman universals‚Äù (Donald Brown etc.) and pick your favorites to be opposed by better forms of education. </div></div><br> <b>‚Äî     ‚Äú ‚Äù  ,            .        , ‚Äú    ‚Äù,    ,   ,    .            ,   ,       -?</b> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Yes, as they say, ‚Äúmusic is not in the piano,‚Äù but it is thanks to the piano that we can play the greatest music in our history.

(and some of these instruments arose because these musicians invented new types of music that required these new instruments!).

It is a good idea. <br></div></div><br>  <b>- How do you feel about immersing children into working with computers from an early age?</b>  <b>Many very parents very severely limit this to at least 7 years.</b> <br><br>  - How about reading in early childhood?  Or designer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinkertoy">TinkerToys</a> ?  These are great ideas if the books are good and the tools are good. <br><br><h2>  Ivan Ponomarev </h2>  <i>(Java programmer)</i> <br><br><h3>  Question 58 </h3><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">original</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  58) Paradigm, one of the keystrokes of the smalltalk language and OOP, it‚Äôs not a purely object-oriented multi-paradigm?  It is still not fully understood, or it is the way programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãevolve?  (If you‚Äôre looking for what you‚Äôre looking for?), <br><br>  Mulitparadigm is generally good.  ‚ÄúBad-paradigm‚Äù is almost always bad.  Imperative programming with data structures (and using ‚Äúsetters‚Äù in ‚ÄúOOP‚Äù) is a very bad way to program.  But combining good ways to program is good.  Religions tend to be bad, because they‚Äôve been hard times to tolerate multiple perspectives.  So it would be a very good thing.  There is a possibility to make a difference. </div></div><br>  <b>- As one of the authors of the Smalltalk language and the OOP paradigm, how do you feel about the fact that the widely used programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãdo not adhere to a pure OOP, being essentially multi-paradigm?</b>  <b>This is the result of the fact that the possibilities of pure OOP have been underestimated, or is it all right?</b> <br><br>  - Multi-paradigm in a programming language is, on the whole, good.  Bad is when a bad paradigm is used in a language.  Imperative programming using structures as well as ‚Äúsetters‚Äù in the ‚Äúso-called OOP‚Äù are very bad ways to program.  A religious cult becomes evil even if it tries to be good, because it faces difficulties in relation to various changes in the world - and it also happens that a cult arises about the wrong ideas.  Therefore, to remove any ‚Äúreligious cult‚Äù from the computer sphere would be a great blessing.  The real question is this: how to create systems in which ‚Äúsimple things would be simple, and complex things are possible.‚Äù  This, among other things, implies the possibility of changing one's point of view on things over time, as well as the ability to make changes, expending a reasonable amount of effort. <br><br><h2>  Artiom Zheltov </h2>  <i>(futurologist)</i> <br><br><h3>  Question 60 </h3><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">original</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  60) How did Xerox PARC developers get tasks to do?  How did they identify / foresee problems that they've been solved with the tech they've developed at PARC? <br><br>  The researcher organization at Parc was ‚Äúflat‚Äù, no one was told to do anything.  Because Xerox ‚Äúcounted heads‚Äù was used when we spent a few days.  We‚Äôve all come from the ARPA-IPTO research projects, and are carried out by us.  There were ‚Äúadmired personalities‚Äù.  There was a weekly meeting of all to sort things out.  Interests were offered, pledges could be made.  If you‚Äôve spent your time, you‚Äôll spend 20‚Äì30% of our time as ‚Äúhands‚Äù for someone else (as a programmer or soldering, etc.). <br><br>  There are always a number of projects around the ‚Äúadmired personalities‚Äù and ‚Äúexciting projects‚Äù (eg Butler Lampson, Chuck Thacker, the Alto, Ethernet, etc). that persisted for varying lengths of time.  My group - the Learning Research Group - persisted for most of 8 years. </div></div><br><br><h3>  Question 61 </h3><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">original</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  61) There's a hypothesis that you really needed it at that time.  They were nice to have, awesome futuristic things.  But 40 years later they became the foundational element of people's lives.  If you‚Äôre looking for something like that? <br><br>  It was needed at the time, it was realized.  No thinking one can see it </div></div><br>  <b>- There is a hypothesis that those things that you created or invented were not claimed at the time.</b>  <b>They were something to enjoy, amazing futuristic things.</b>  <b>But 40 years later, they became the cornerstone in people's lives.</b>  <b>In this situation, as you think, what amazing futuristic things, irrelevant in our day, will be able to solve some problems in the future?</b> <br><br>  - I would say that what we invented was relevant at one time, just almost no one realized.
