  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Another saga about the quality of services of RBC Hosting Center</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently, the cup of my patience in communicating with the support of RBC hosting was overcrowded, which was the reason for writing this topic. <br>  I understand that there is no ideal hosting, and I have already become accustomed to constant problems with RBC, one can even say that I got used to it and considered them to be in the order of things. <br>  The main problem was that the hoster could disconnect at any time (to work with the UPU) at any time without warning.  Why don't you actually warn clients in advance to my requests?  They answered that they say these are all not planned problems and they cannot warn about it because  busy with them, although the solution of such problems could take more than a day. <br><br>  And this time the situation began to develop in a similar way ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <strong>03/17/09 3 pm</strong> - The site began to work one time, the connection to FTP was lost during the listing, the ping to the IPN was completed with a 70% loss <br>  <strong>03/17/09 4 pm</strong> - I wrote to the caliper and explained the above <br>  <strong>03/17/09 5:00 pm</strong> - in response, there is no greeting.  I called in support, they received the answer that this is another unforeseen problem and it will be eliminated within 30 minutes <br>  <strong>03/17/09 6:00 pm</strong> - a letter from the caliper that the problem was fixed ... Having checked that it found that the UPU <strong>didn‚Äôt work</strong> and still <strong>doesn‚Äôt work</strong> .  What corrected is not clear. <br>  <strong>03/17/09 18-30</strong> - wrote to the caliper that the problem was not solved, ping goes as before with a 70% loss, and FTP still does not allow listing directories <br>  <strong>03/17/09 7-00 pm</strong> - a very interesting response from the caliper came, literally: ‚ÄúIn the last application we fixed the problem with access via ftp, I apologize for not paying attention to the server response by ping requests.  At the moment there are small problems on the communication channel, our specialists are aware of the problem and are doing everything possible to fix it as soon as possible. ‚ÄùI was very alarmed by this answer, because  was like a banal excuse. <br>  <strong>03/17/09 19-10</strong> - I wrote to the caliper, I repeated that FTP didn‚Äôt work and didn‚Äôt work, and what they fixed was not clear.  Caliper gone ... <br>  <strong>03/18/09 07-00</strong> - finally a not less interesting answer came from the caliper: ‚ÄúThe issue with the communication channel has been resolved.  To restore the full functionality of your server, it was required to reboot it, which was done ‚Äù.  The second sentence again looked like an excuse in delaying the solution of the problem due to MY fault - I did not reload the IPU.  So sorry!  About this it was necessary to at least warn!  But the most interesting thing is that the problem remained - the ping was still with big losses, 50%. <br>  <strong>03/18/09 09-00</strong> - I wrote to the caliper that they were apparently being bullied by me.  From that moment on, the caliper disappeared completely ... The UPU earned only towards the evening of the 18th, but after that the caller did not receive any letters with notifications or apologies. <br>  <strong>03/20/09 12-30</strong> - wrote to the caliper with the question: ‚ÄúIs it customary in your office not to respond to customer letters?‚Äù <br>  <strong>03.20.09 20-30</strong> - came the response from the caliper, literally: ‚ÄúWe apologize <strong>for the long waiting for the response to the application</strong> .  This is what the situation with access to VPS is now with me: 0% loss. ‚Äù  I was shocked by this answer ... <br>  03/20/09 11-00 pm - I wrote to the support that now everything is OK, and the problem was observed on March 17-18 and you chose to keep silent about it. <br>  <strong>03/21/09 02-30</strong> - support for the support: ‚ÄúIn the absence of technical questions and an exhausted problem, <strong>I‚Äôll</strong> close this application.‚Äù <br><br>  Everything. <br>  What I was not satisfied with: <br><ol><li>  no notice when disconnecting / restarting / unavailability of the UPPS from the side of the support </li><li>  it is not clear how the monitoring service works, or there is none at all, because  until you report the problems, the caliper itself will not know about it </li><li>  long response caliper </li><li>  excuses and pure lies from the caliper </li><li>  caliper can not recognize their mistakes and apologize for them </li></ol>

      Threat all this was aggravated by the fact that just in the 17-18 days in Moscow were held major international tourism exhibitions, which presented our site.  And presenting a non-working site is a very fun thing. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/55112/">https://habr.com/ru/post/55112/</a></p>
