Personally, I am struck by the situation when the aching people complain about all sorts of laws and prohibitions, takes the side of those people who love to prohibit all that has fallen. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  I will not touch the plot of the game, because everyone knows what he is about.  The question is to play or not to play ... everyone should take it himself, because: <br><ol><li>  The freedom of one person is limited by the freedom of another, and no one has the right to decide for others. </li><li>  No one has the right to forbid anything for others.  We are all adults and we are responsible for everything we do. </li><li>  If you do not like something do not buy and do not play, just pass by </li><li>  If you do not want to pass by, tell your friends about this game so that they do not even dare to buy it (otherwise God forbid). </li></ol><br><br><h5>  But what about the children? .. </h5><br>  The game has a rating of 18+.

    <h5>  But after all they can accidentally play it.  Is not it so? </h5><br>  The game is worth the money and not small.  If you ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù bought your child this game and did not see a mark about age restrictions, then that means you are the parent. <br><br><h5>  So the game can be found on the Internet. </h5><br>  On the Internet, a lot of things can be found, not to mention the most obvious (films containing pornographic content), movies / games with rozsylenka, Nazi propaganda, distribution of indulgences on Twitter and so on.  To protect children from this, parental control tools have long been invented, and if you are too lazy to deal with it, this again says a lot.  By the way, after the ban on the sale, on the Internet CoH2 will download even more. <br><br><h5>  And what ate, I do not want to deal with all kinds of "parental control", but I do not have time for children?  Let the state forbid it to everyone, but it will be easier for me. </h5><br>  Let's start with the fact that you did the children, not the state, and the children should love (or not love) the children, not the state.  If you do not have time to take care of children, then what difference do you have by whom and how they will grow up.  I know many who cry that did not find time for their children.  If you think that it is better to ban everything.  then you probably <a href="http://lurkmore.to/%25D0%259A%25D0%259D%25D0%2594%25D0%25A0)">here</a> , I think there you will be happy. <br><br>  It is obvious that the majority of those who voted for the ban in the games most likely did not play and did not even intend to.  So why not just buy it (no one forces) and not recommend it to friends.  And if you still want to ban, so grab and Mikhalkov's films.  Stop!  But what about Call of Duty: Modern Warfare and Battlefield 3, because when you play online (and not only), you can get into the American team and shoot at Russian soldiers ?!  Prohibit! <br><br>  I understand perfectly well that your feelings could have been hurt, but we do not prohibit other races, because they hurt the feelings of racists, or other religions and indeed a lot of things. <br>  I also do not like this version of the story, but as mentioned in this video <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DkOJzzaF2o8E">www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOJzzaF2o8E</a> , the plot is based on the book by Vasily Grosman, which is not prohibited by us.  Plus, it's just a game.  At the same time, I would strongly recommend 1C to add a warning to the game or on the box with it that the opinion of the game developers may not coincide with yours (well, or something like that). <br><br>  Here is a link to a fairly objective review without unnecessary emotions and grumbling saliva: <a href="http://www.igromania.ru/articles/211530/Company_of_Heroes_2.htm">www.igromania.ru/articles/211530/Company_of_Heroes_2.htm</a> <br><br>  Therefore, I propose to vote for another petition: <a href="http://urlid.ru/bbl8">Restore the sales of the computer game Company of Heroes-2 in the CIS</a> <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Petition text</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  No one has the right to forbid anything for others, guided only by their own desire, without taking into account the fact that there can be no less dissenters with them. <br><br>  Therefore, it is necessary to restore sales of the Company of Heroes-2 game to the Russian and CIS markets, because despite the controversial storyline, this product cannot have a strong influence on public opinion regarding the relevant historical period, since its target audience is adults over 18 years old. (based on the age restrictions specified in the game), which already have established views and ideology. <br><br>  In addition, such a presentation of the story is not unique.  On the territory of both the Russian Federation and the CIS countries, quite well-known films and books are not prohibited, moreover, some of them are quite popular. <br><br>  In addition, we should not forget that in real-time strategies, the plot is a secondary element and most players do not pay attention to it. <br><br>  Given the specifics of the storyline, it might be worthwhile to make some warnings that would be clearly visible on the game box, or something similar, but it‚Äôs wrong to prohibit its sale to everyone without exception. <br><br>  I would also like to draw your attention to the fact that the video review proposed for familiarization in the petition to stop selling the game is not objective, overflowing with emotions and generally created by a non-professional game journalist. <br><br>  In the same petition, an attempt to speculate about the purchase of other products published by 1C-Interest is noticeable.  Given the regional specifics, there is reason to believe that the overwhelming majority of those who supported the ban on selling the game did not even think about buying it without knowing the features of the story campaign.  Banning the sale of "Company of heroes-2" will only spur on an illegal way of distributing it, since for those who want it, it will remain the only one. <br><br>  On the other hand, the article from a well-known Russian gaming publication provides a fairly objective opinion of experts in the gaming industry.  Its author makes a review without a surplus of emotions, but still focuses on the plot aspect, and the game itself received a rather high ball. <br><br>  We are not indifferent to the actions of our ancestors, we just want to make a decision ourselves and do not want to be taken for us. <br><br>  We hope for your objectivity and common sense in this matter. </div></div><br><br>  I want to note that the act of our ancestors is also dear to me, but you are not children for a long time and you need to understand the difference between game and reality.  Therefore, the rating is 18+. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/189220/">https://habr.com/ru/post/189220/</a></p>
