Yes, this fall in St. Petersburg!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/334/3a9/615/3343a96159954a53008d25903e81ad12.png" alt="image"><br><br>  It is gratifying to admit: we are still moving towards the civilized world, this is especially evident in the IT industry.  It is easy to see how the data center market is rapidly growing and developing in Russia: new cooling and power supply technologies are being actively promoted, efficiency and fault tolerance are increasing, various data center systems are constantly being upgraded, attestation and certification are being held, and more and more appear new heavy duty sites.  Observing such a rapid development of the industry, its leading experts decided to systematize all updates, and recently the first All-Russian forum of data center operators was announced to openly communicate with professionals in both formal and informal settings. <br><br>  The forum will be held on November 15‚Äì16, 2012 near St. Petersburg - at Helios Hotel, which is located on the shores of the Gulf of Finland.  The event is not a commercial project and will be the first event of its kind in the Russian IT industry.  It is important to note that the main distinguishing feature of the forum from similar projects is the club (closed) format, which implies the absence of vendors and media representatives - only employees of commercial and corporate data center operators are invited to participate in the forum.  This format of the event will allow to speak freely and discuss a wide range of issues. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  What will the forum be devoted to?  What can be learned by taking part in it?  During the two days of the forum, a series of speeches will be held on topics such as: <br>  unconventional solutions in energy saving data centers; <br>  operation of air conditioning systems in a hot period of time; <br>  efficiency and cost reduction, accounting and resource management systems for data centers, implementation, maintenance and operation of data centers by the contractor; <br>  experience of certification of data centers in the context of Russian specificity; <br>  customer focus, interaction with representatives of supervisory organizations, as well as many other issues.

      At the end of the working sessions of the first day, a program is provided during which forum participants will be able to communicate in an informal setting. <br><br>  The Data Center Operators Forum is a meeting and communication place for people who seek to develop and improve the engineering infrastructure of their facilities, not stopping there, are looking for new solutions, creating and improving services for external and internal customers.  This is a platform for people who really do not care about the future of the data center industry, for those who are ready to share their ideas and best practices with colleagues and partners. <br><br>  The format of the event allows you to cover the most relevant issues for the data center industry: <br>  the best cases for the construction, design, operation and modernization of data centers; <br>  building relationships with vendors, contractors and equipment suppliers; <br>  interaction with authorities; <br>  Western standards, taking into account the nuances of the Russian regulatory documentation; <br>  economic and information security; <br>  customer service, as well as the implementation of new services. <br><br>  At the forum in the presentations of the speakers will prevail the practical component, based on their own experience in project implementation.  Meeting "without ties" suggests the opportunity to get answers to many sensitive questions.  However, to discuss the most pressing issues as invited guests, the forum will be attended by clients using data center services, as well as government representatives responsible for key areas of industry development. <br><br>  Some of the stated topics are: <br>  ‚Ä¢ Features of outsourcing data center operation: <br>  ‚Ä¢ Features of the operation of corporate and commercial data centers; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Economics of data center operation outsourcing; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Some practical observations on certification of Uptime Instititute; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Operational stability of the data center, where to start ?; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Improving the efficiency and methods of reducing electricity consumption in the data center; <br><br>  We invite companies to sponsor the forum! <br><br>  Information about the event, the program of the forum and registration - on the website <a href="http://dcoperators.ru/">dcoperators.ru</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/152211/">https://habr.com/ru/post/152211/</a></p>
