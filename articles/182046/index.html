In addition to the main content about how to properly ask questions to get the answers you need, the book has an introduction in which Alan talks about his way to success.  From the age of ten he began to trade in rubber sponges, and at the age of eighteen he became the best sales agent in a company selling bed linen and kitchenware.  It is not surprising that with such a rich experience he knew how to communicate with people and learned to understand when people are interested in his product, and when they want him to leave as soon as possible. <br><br>  After examining the gestures and postures of clients, Alan Pease wrote a book called Body Language, which was distributed in hundreds of millions of copies and was translated into 36 languages.  The book tells about all kinds of gestures, postures, personal space, the difference in the gestures of different cultures and how to properly use this knowledge. <br><br>  When Alan was eleven years old, he sold sponges to raise money to build a club for a scout squad.  Scout-master, a wise old man, shared with Alan a secret, which was named by Alan ‚Äúthe law of probability distribution‚Äù.  This rule is literally:

    <blockquote>  Luck is a game, the longer you play, the more you win.  And the more you win, the more successfully you play. </blockquote><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/50e/c08/cf2/50ec08cf22e9c6df538e4bc90df49872.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Further, Alan expresses several rules that are applicable to the "working network" - network marketing, but they are relevant in all areas. <br><br><h5>  Rule 1. Communicate more with people. </h5><br>  This is the most important rule.  Talk and communicate with all potential employees, customers, colleagues and just people.  ‚ÄúFrom the very first stage of building your business, you have to talk to everyone because you need practice.‚Äù  There are no such problems [in your business] that could not be solved by increasing your activity. <br><br><h5>  Rule 2. Communicate even more with people. </h5><br>  You can make the best presentation, but if there is no one to show it, there will be no sense from it.  The most important thing is to talk to people.  The more people you are interested in, the greater the chance that one of them will agree to be your client. <br><br><h5>  Rule 3. And communicate more with people. </h5><br>  Many aspiring entrepreneurs, businessmen, or marketing participants think that the reason for their failure is simply the lack of luck or the inconsistency of customers.  In fact, this is not so (well, perhaps sometimes) - this is due to the lack of communication with potential clients or candidates. <br><br><h5>  Rule 4. Use the law of probability distribution. </h5><br>  The law of the normal distribution of probability obeys any activity in life.  This means that if you do the same thing over and over again, in the same way, under the influence of the same environment, the result will also remain unchanged. <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúIn the insurance business, I discovered that the probability is 1:56.  This means that if I go out and ask a negative question: ‚ÄúWould you like to buy life insurance?‚Äù, Then only one person out of 56 will answer: ‚ÄúYes‚Äù!  This suggests that if I ask the same question 168 times, I can sell 3 contracts per day and be among the top 5% of insurance agents! <br><br>  If you stand on the corner of the street and ask each passing person: ‚ÄúDo you want to join my work network in my business?‚Äù, The law of probability will bring results: 1 out of 100 will answer ‚ÄúYes‚Äù.  The law of probability always works. ‚Äù </blockquote><br>  When Alan was a kid, he sold sponges for 20 cents a piece.  His probability distribution looked like this: <br><br>  <b>10/7/4/2.</b> <br><br>  Out of every 10 doors he knocked on from 4 to 6 days, only 7 people opened the door for him.  Only 4 of them could listen to him, and, ultimately, only two acquired goods.  If he knocked at 60 doors in two hours, he sold 12 sponges = $ 2.40, a lot of money at the time, especially for an 11-year-old boy.  Knowing the law of probability distribution, Alan was not upset either because of those three who did not open the door, or because of those who could not listen to him, and not even because of those who did not buy his goods.  He knew that if he knocked at 10 doors, he would earn 40 cents.  This means that if he touched the door, he already received 4 cents, no matter what happened next! <br><br><blockquote>  This for me was a strong driving force - you just need to knock on any 10 doors and get your 40 cents!  All success depended only on how quickly I could knock on these doors. </blockquote><br>  Record your results and count the average. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Another story from the book</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  My personal $ 9 slot poker machine <br><br>  When I was a teenager, I worked in the evenings selling goods <br>  household items: pots, pans, linens and blankets, <br>  mainly working on recommendations.  My score is <br>  It was: <br><br>  5: 3: 2: 1 <br><br>  Out of every 5 phone calls of recommended clients, 3 made an appointment for me.  However, I knew that I had a chance to show my goods only to two of them, since the third client, as a rule, for one reason or another, either simply did not come, or called back and canceled the appointment.  Of the remaining 2 potential customers who agreed to listen to me and see the product, only one eventually bought it.  Selling my goods to one buyer, I earned $ 45.  Thus, calling 5 people for the evening, I received the result in the amount of $ 45, which means that each phone call I made brought me a profit of $ 9. <br>  It also means that every positive phone answer equals $ 15 of my earnings, regardless of whether they all make a purchase from me or not, whether everyone will come to an appointment or not, and no matter what they told me about <br>  phone!  Wow!  It was just great! <br><br>  On a large piece of paper, I drew a large figure of $ 9 and hung it on the wall near my phone.  I made a profit of $ 9 from every person answering my phone call.  With every positive response to my proposal and meeting arrangements, I earned $ 15.  This meant that I completely took control of the course of my fate!  Most of the people who engaged in this business with me, regardless of age, fell into despair with every negative response to their proposals.  Soon I became the best seller company in the country. <br><br>  My final ratio of 5: 3: 2: 1 was interpreted as: <br><br>  Telephone calls $ 9.00 <br>  Scheduled meetings $ 15.00 <br>  Product Presentation $ 22.00 <br>  Selling goods $ 45.00 <br><br>  I have never looked for people who wanted to buy my product.  My main goal was to call my potential buyers. <br><br>  This is the main key.  Do not focus your attention on attracting new distributors - pay attention to potential candidates, those who will listen to your presentation. <br>  The law of probability takes care of the rest. <br></div></div><br><br>  There are a few more examples in the book, including in the area thanks to which he became rich, possessing only the law of probability distribution.  And indeed, this law works not only in sales, if we slightly change it, we can get the phrase ‚Äúintensity is more important than thoroughness‚Äù.  We need to take less care of each client trying to buy something from us, spending too much time and effort on it.  We need to increase the number of clients surveyed, so we get the result. <br><br>  We will apply this law in completely different areas, for example in studying English.  Many people use English courses in which classes take place, for example, three times a week.  But this is not intensive enough, a person becomes unaccustomed to English, it is difficult for him every time to remember the information he heard 2 days ago. <br><br>  It is much more effective to learn English every day, at least for 20 minutes.  You have to be constantly in the environment, thus, ‚Äúyou increase the chance that in one day, you will begin to understand better‚Äù.  Write an audiobook on the player (I recommend <a href="http://lingq.com/">http://lingq.com/</a> ) or listen and watch the video with the translation ( <a href="http://lingualeo.ru/">http://lingualeo.ru/</a> ), but do it every day.  I spend time every day and watch Disney cartoons in English.  Cartoons are easier to read, and all the cues sound clear. <br><br>  All this is much more important than one deep session, for example, ‚Äúdevoting a whole day‚Äù to learning English.  Group classes are thorough, big lessons, they are useful, but they do not allow you to plunge into the environment when the brain gets used to thinking in English. <br><br>  When I applied this law in different areas, it worked everywhere (stretching is important to do every day, not just one day, even carefully, or play sports preferably every other day, but without large gaps), but in programming I had doubts: reading articles such as <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/alconost/blog/181193">Creator Mode, Manager Mode,</a> and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/166715/">Never Distract a Programmer!</a>  I was a little confused. <br><br>  Programmers in fact work in large chunks of time, which can be called more thoroughness than intensity.  But after watching how I write the code, I came to the conclusion that programmers are often ‚Äúartificially distracted‚Äù for a large session, they can switch to another task, drink coffee, think about refactoring.  And all in order to proceed to the task again, each time increasing the chance that, say, an error will be found.  In addition, programmers work every day, and when they don‚Äôt work, they write code for their own pleasure, which can also be called intensity. <br><br>  Do not despair if you do not get something - try to do it as often as possible.  Start a difficult business many times, and one of the "times" you will definitely succeed.  What people call a lack of inspiration or a creative crisis, I equate to a lack of attempts to do something.  If you start to work often, there is a high ‚Äúprobability‚Äù that a brilliant idea will come up some time. <br><br>  Write about all errors in private messages, I will promptly fix it! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/182046/">https://habr.com/ru/post/182046/</a></p>
