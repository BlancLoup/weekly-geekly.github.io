  <section class="page js-page"><h1>A working advice to improve personal effectiveness</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Many of you had the thought of making money or improving a certain quality.  Agree, there was such a desire or even a need.  What did you do?  Subscribed to conferences on time management, case management / projects.  Read the electronic literature. <br><br>  Yes, often the easiest for many is to buy books like: ‚ÄúEasy way to increase productivity‚Äù, ‚ÄúHow to make money on the blog $ 1000‚Äù, ‚ÄúTaking into account personal time‚Äù, ‚ÄúFive ways to effectively conduct business‚Äù.  Probably, you have read far more than one book, because after reading one, you just need to study how this problem is solved in a different approach, and then in the third.  Right, right? <br><br>  I have read dozens, if not hundreds of books of this kind on the basis of my education and occupation.  Books are good.  There are great books, and there is a frank trash.  But in any case, I even read trash - you make the brains work.  Familiar with the situation?

      What struck me in the fifth ten books?  So this is the fact that in one book there was nothing fundamentally new from what I studied in school and university.  Hear?  nothing!  This is elementary, healthy, sober logic.  In these books voiced truths. <br><br>  Do only one thing.  Record all your affairs.  Set priorities.  Break up major cases into a number of small components.  Do not be distracted, enter the hours of silence. <br><br>  Nothing like?  In our school it was like that.  At the lesson of mathematics we do mathematics, and not mixed with history.  Homework recorded strictly in the diary.  Strictly on the day required.  After the lessons - walk 30 minutes.  And only then homework.  Priority walks above.  The poems were taught by paragraph, not entirely, but by paragraph.  Talking in class was forbidden. <br><br>  This, attention, rules for first graders.  And adults read books, re-read, understand, argue, discuss which technique is better.  And that instead of following the simple rules of primary school. <br><br>  Read one, any book.  And act all in accordance with it, include logic.  Do, and do not look for the best technique.  Read fiction, solve puzzles, learn poems by heart - all this develops brains.  For without a brain, to master pick up - a child - from a kindergarten - to pay - an apartment - to buy - a light bulb - to buy - food - to remove - an apartment - to wash - a car - to congratulate - a wife - happy - birthday - to cut - a lawn - to buy - a gift - unreal.  And all the books of the world will not help you. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/23729/">https://habr.com/ru/post/23729/</a></p>
