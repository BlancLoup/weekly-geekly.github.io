The struggle to establish contact with corporate clients has become the scale of the epidemic.  I set a goal: to find out what it takes to re-access to large companies. <br><br>  I had to talk with a lot of people and experiment with a variety of techniques and strategies.  Then I concentrated on removing the obstacles I encountered on my way.

      And suddenly, I began to get audiences from key decision makers.  Continuing to act in the same spirit, I finally realized that my approach would bring success to any specialist engaged in sales in the B2B sector.  Since then, almost all my trainings have been devoted to how to get access to large companies.  This is the most important question regarding sellers from any industry.  So far, not all of them know what they should do differently in order to succeed - that is why I wrote this book. <br><br>  Compared with yesterday, we are surrounded by a completely different world.  To succeed in the crazy conditions of the modern market, new approaches are needed.  The use of good old techniques will not lead you anywhere, especially in a large corporation. <br><br>  I wrote a book to help you reach out to large corporate clients and get big contracts.  I wish to find in it everything you need to achieve your goals.  Have a good sales year! <br><br><h2>  Part I. Accept the Challenge </h2><br><h3>  Chapter 1. Why no one calls you back </h3><br>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãworking with large customers seems unbelievable to most sellers.  Even experienced professionals get lost before meeting with the corporate monster.  For a long time I had to get used to the fact that the decision makers in large companies are ordinary people.  It just so happens that they work here. <br><br>  The current situation is due to a combination of a number of market factors that actually created the <abbr title="The combination of adverse circumstances, giving a total catastrophic effect (synonymous with the concept of &quot;worse than ever&quot;)">‚Äúperfect storm‚Äù</abbr> for sellers.  Below are the current trends affecting sales: <br><br><ul><li>  large companies continue to grow and globalize.  They are constantly restructured, reorganized and optimized.  Permanent changes lead to the emergence of an army of tired, regularly suffering from overtime work of employees who have a persistent antipathy to the next transformations; </li><li>  corporate decision-makers continue to master new technologies in order to improve communication, improve their knowledge, make rational use of time and avoid failures in their already overloaded schedule; </li><li>  the competition is getting tougher as identical products appear literally overnight.  Potential customers do not believe that any company is able to retain a competitive advantage for a long time; </li><li>  confronted daily with a flurry of marketing information, corporate buyers are increasingly becoming immune to even the weakest attempts at self-promotion from sellers.  And this storm will not subside in the near future. </li></ul><br>  These trends make it harder: <br><br><ul><li>  determine where decisions are made and who specifically participates in this process; </li><li>  convince overloaded customers to find time to meet with you; </li><li>  differentiate your offer from competitors without disturbing its profitability; </li><li>  demonstrate your exceptional value in meetings with customers - so much so that decision makers will want to work with you, despite higher prices. </li></ul><br>  To be successful in a radically changing sales world, it is important to rethink how to start working with customers.  The first task is to examine your existing approach to large companies in order to determine where changes are needed. <br><br>  Most sellers, tormented in trying to describe their company and offer in the best way, rarely get distracted in order to listen to how their offer sounds from the point of view of potential customers. <br><br>  A successful modern salesman spends significantly more time than the average, on thinking about, studying and preparing to meet with the customer.  <u>Careful analysis</u> is an exceptional quality that determines the result of the interaction.  Successful sales begin with a deep understanding of the customer. <br><br><h3>  Chapter 2. How to do business with large and very large companies. </h3><br>  If there are few large customers in your customer base, you can easily endow them with exaggerated abilities.  However, corporations are constantly turning to third-party resources that help them improve their operations. <br><br>  <b>Joy</b> <br>  My first contract with a large company was made in the amount of $ 10,000. Eight years later and 500,000 dollars earned, I still worked with her.  During this time, I worked with many units involved in various projects related to my professional field.  Some were very ambitious, which allowed me to master skills that I hadn‚Äôt even dreamed of before this job.  As a rule, large companies are much less price sensitive than small ones.  They understand that competent specialists and quality products cannot be cheap. <br><br>  <b>Pains</b> <br>  When their financial indicators cease to be optimistic, analysts begin to press, and suddenly the movement stops.  Budgets are frozen, and cost cutting is becoming common.  If you bet too much on one player, then your financial stability may falter overnight. <br><br>  <b>‚Ä¶ but</b> <br>  As a result, you upgrade your skills, making you more competitive.  And finally, there is nothing better than having well-known corporations on your list. <br><br>  Most sellers find it easier to start working with the functional unit, since there they can: <br><br><ul><li>  find out the names of decision makers; </li><li>  to analyze without losing sight of the scale of the company; </li><li>  find out where problems and gaps may appear in their activities; </li><li>  determine the differences between them; </li><li>  apply an individualized entry strategy. </li></ul><br><h4>  Apply a gradual entry strategy </h4><br>  I believe that the conclusion of the initial contract with a large company is quite possible for you.  The best way to do this is to find and satisfy the urgent need of your potential customer.  You can start small and take advantage of small opportunities to form long-term relationships.  New business opportunities will emerge if you focus on helping customers improve their operations. <br><br>  Find the most effective focus point.  Many years ago, I discovered that it was much easier for me to establish relationships with large companies if I focused my input strategy on a specific business problem.  As soon as I was able to successfully complete the project, I informed clients that I could help in resolving other issues. <br><br>  Look at existing clients - is there a pattern in how you entered into your first contract with them?  Ask yourself the following questions: <br><br><ul><li>  What did you start with: with a specific type of problem or with an opportunity?  if so, with what? </li><li>  Did you have a unique product that interested potential buyers?  if so, why was he of interest?  What value did you offer? </li><li>  Is it possible to say that they preferred you because they believed that the existing supplier could not solve the problems that had arisen in certain areas of their business?  If so, what problems did you solve? </li></ul><br>  I strongly recommend carefully studying the competitors.  Ideal companies do not exist.  Find the weak links in their product and use this in order to get into the corporation with your own proposal deprived of these weaknesses.  Do not face your heads with competitors.  Track their omissions. <br><br>  If you are trying to start working with a large company, take up any project that you are offered - even if it is not among your direct interests.  The nuggets can turn into highly profitable relationships. <br><br>  Divide large sentences into parts.  If your product is worth a lot of money, it will be much more difficult for you to conclude the first contract with a large company.  You will encounter difficulties related to budget coordination, red tape with the sighting of documents, a crowd of employees involved, increased transparency and a high degree of personal risk for decision makers. <br><br>  If possible, think about how you can create smaller solutions.  The easier it is for customers to start using your product, the faster you will get into a large company.  Try to determine which part of your proposal could be the best starting strategy.  Do not complicate the situation. <br><br><h3>  Chapter 3. Try to understand decision makers </h3><br>  Large corporations are under intense pressure forcing them to show confident financial indicators to shareholders.  If they fail to meet quarterly forecasts, the market‚Äôs response will be merciless.  There will be a fall in stock prices, a rising cost of borrowing and firing.  Those who managed to resist, take on the work performed earlier by two or three employees.  Cooperating with large companies means to be in the midst of this hell. <br><br>  Key employees often face ever-growing, unrealistic expectations ‚Äî work more, better, and faster.  In conditions of constant cuts, it is important to look busy.  This is a kind of work.  People prefer to sit quietly, do everything possible, and stay in the shade longer.  Often they think about how to please the authorities, and not about solving difficult issues. <br><br>  Corporate buyers are also very smart about the options that they have.  They know that a product like yours is widely available ‚Äî and probably at a lower price.  From their point of view, almost everything is a commodity.  Cynicism reigns.  The only thing that can be opposed to him is stories about real customers with a tangible and measurable result. <br><br>  People in large companies are really facing a huge burden.  They are usually too busy to: <br><br><ul><li>  explore ways to improve the company's existing systems, processes and techniques, despite the fact that because of this they can lose an incredible amount of time or money; </li><li>  deal with problems that have not yet entered the stage of crisis; </li><li>  plan ahead for the future; </li><li>  identify critical success factors; </li><li>  identify gaps in your work </li><li>  implement popular strategies. </li></ul><br>  Instead of dealing with the causes, they treat the symptoms, which ultimately leads to negative consequences. <br><br>  The last thing that decision makers in corporations are willing to do is additional work.  They are already overloaded, and the mountain of affairs continues to grow.  Even the most positive change breaks the balance.  Outsourcing continues to gain momentum as companies focus on key areas of expertise. <br><br>  In today's market, you will not always be able to make decisions in your favor.  And while you will always win back part of the budget for your product from other articles of expenditure. <br><br>  Mistakes that you wouldn‚Äôt want to commit: <br><br><ul><li>  Do not waste time potential customers in vain.  If you are trying to make an appointment for them, be sure to give good reasons for this; </li><li>  Do not try to make friends with them.  Those who constantly suffer from lack of time will not waste precious seconds discussing their trip to Mexico with a stranger who is trying to sell them something.  First of all, you need to prove your commercial value; </li><li>  Do not expect them to talk about their business.  If you before the call or meet, study the situation, it will not cause questions.  But if you do not do this, then completely destroy your trust in you; </li><li>  Do not turn the meeting into a "dump" of proposals.  It‚Äôs a big mistake to believe that the best thing is to make a proposal, going into the smallest details.  Emphasis should be placed on the main point, but nothing good will come of an overly detailed story; </li><li>  do not use selfish vocabulary.  The more often you claim that your offer is ‚Äúthe best of all possible,‚Äù the less a potential client trusts you; </li><li>  Do not expect potential customers to intuitively feel the value of the offer or do all the calculations for you. </li></ul><br><h3>  Chapter 4. The most important thing is to create differences. </h3><br>  Over the years, I have talked with many people who felt extremely ineligible for this kind of work, because they: <br><br><ul><li>  did not consider themselves brisk interlocutors; </li><li>  did not like to praise their products; </li><li>  abhorred their boastfulness by their abilities, ‚Äúthey didn‚Äôt know how to improvise properly‚Äù; </li><li>  did not have confident skills in closing transactions. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ld/qu/v1/ldquv1aql0icn3zkxf0zzcobyxk.png" alt="New model of success in sales"><br><br>  Modern sellers are obliged to focus on finding problem areas or missed opportunities within the customer‚Äôs business that are not in the field of view of competitors.  Focusing on demand generation is a proactive and stimulating measure, as opposed to the traditional seller‚Äôs response to existing needs. <br><br>  By bringing your knowledge, competence and ideas into relationships, you separate yourself from peddlers who are trying to sell a product.  As a result, you become irresistible and customers want to deal with you.  The best sellers are an integral asset of their client‚Äôs business. <br><br>  Once you are targeting a large company, start asking yourself the questions listed below to determine the difference that you can form: <br><br><ul><li>  How can this company deal with my offer? </li><li>  What are the potential problems she faces? </li><li>  What of my toolkit can be used to positively impact her business? </li><li>  that I (people in my company) know about this industry, market, processes, working cycle, challenges;  What could be useful to the client?  why? </li><li>  How similar are the problems of this company to the problems of my other clients? </li><li>  What measures could she have applied to solve these problems or to achieve goals? </li><li>  What strategic initiatives are already being implemented? </li></ul><br>  Please note that none of these issues are related to sales.  Everything is focused on improving the business.  You are the initiator of change, and you need to think accordingly. <br><br><ol><li>  <b>Explicitly denote your benefits.</b>  Provide numbers, percentages, timeframes, and statistics.  At the first contact, it is necessary to state your value clearly and loudly so that everyone can hear. </li><li>  <b>Personalize any contact.</b>  Whenever you talk to decision makers, you should mention something that indicates your knowledge of their business, industry. </li><li>  <b>Be a provocateur.</b>  Speak confidently about the business problems with which, as you know, they are facing. </li><li>  <b>Show how others do it.</b>  Particularly interested in how other organizations deal with similar problems. </li><li>  <b>Communicate on equal terms.</b>  If you talk to them with a dog's devotion in a conversation with them, it will affect your trust in you. </li></ol><br>  Adopt a new sales paradigm.  If you are trying to start working with a large company, you should not focus on your offer.  It is necessary that decision-makers in corporations are imbued with your confidence in the promised effect, but achieve this without unnecessary thickening of colors.  The best way to demonstrate the effect is to talk about the results that your customers have achieved. <br><br><blockquote>  Your qualifications + your offer = business improvement </blockquote><br><h2>  Part II.  Create a base </h2><br><h3>  Chapter 5. The choice of the exact goal: the essence is not in quantity </h3><br>  By constricting your primary market, you increase sales and profits.  The success of sales to large companies no longer depends on the number of potential customers.  It does not depend on the time spent on unanswered calls, from calls to hundreds of people in an attempt to find at least someone who wants to meet with you.  Today sales are: <br><br><ul><li>     ÃÜ,       ; </li><li>    ,    ; </li><li>        ÃÜ. </li></ul><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Choose your future customers. In today's hypercompetitive market with a rich selection of potential suppliers, buyers want to work with professionals who truly know their business. When you know your target market well, you know the exhibitions and sites that are visited by representatives of client companies, magazines and commercial publications that interest them, and even more. You invest less in sales and marketing, and your results are higher, you differentiate your business compared to your competitors, thereby increasing profitability. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The first key to success in sales to large companies is a </font></font><u><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">clear definition of the ideal customer.</font></font></u><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is a group of potential customers who, because they share common characteristics, are especially susceptible to your products. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Begin by identifying demographic indicators or key facts that describe the types of companies you work best with:</font></font><br><br><ul><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> What industry do they work in? </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> how big is a big company? </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> What are their distribution channels? </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> What technology base do they use? </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Who are their customers? </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> What stage of development are they at now? </font></font></li></ul><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Determine the psychographic characteristics of your target market: </font></font><br><br><ul><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> What is the vision and values ‚Äã‚Äãof companies? </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> What is their reputation in the industry? </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> What are their priorities in terms of management? </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> How do you evaluate their perception of the industry, the product offered: positive, negative, neutral? </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> How can you describe their leadership style? </font></font></li></ul><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You can find the key to understanding large corporations by reading what they write about themselves on their websites, in marketing materials and annual reports. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You can learn more by finding out what industry analysts say about the company in online forums or in professional publications. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Former and current employees may also be a good source of information. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As soon as I focused on this narrow segment of the market, my business went up. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">My target market immediately understood what I could do for them and why it was important. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I got the download ten years ahead!</font></font><br><br><ul><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> establish goals, objectives and strategic requirements (entering new markets, increasing sales, profits or market share, improving operational efficiency, reducing the cost of products sold); </font></font></li><li>     ( ,   ,  ,           ,     ). </li></ul><br>   ,    ,       .

Is your value proposition convincing enough? </font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Without an offer that is truly attractive to target buyers, it is difficult to arrange a meeting with decision makers. </font></font><br><br><blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A value proposition is a clear statement of the tangible results a customer will receive from using your products. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is focused on results and emphasizes the value of your proposal.</font></font></blockquote><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A convincing value proposition is specific and often includes numbers or percentages. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It may contain as a demonstration of your abilities a brief description of working with similar clients. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Blitz summary and unique trade offers are equally useless. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Blitz resume has no specifics needed for sales in the corporate market. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">UTP has absolutely no effect on those who do not want any changes and is useless when interacting with large companies. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">These offers absolutely do not contain measurable, quantitatively displayed commercial results.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Corporate buyers are especially attracted by phrases related to their business goals. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Since this is what customers expect to hear, make sure that you include business results-oriented terms in your value proposition:</font></font><br><br><ul><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> increased profitability; </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> shorter period from product development to market launch; </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> cost reduction; </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> improved operational efficiency; </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> global integration activities; </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> improvement of the organization; </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> increasing customer loyalty; </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> integrating e-commerce in marketing and sales; </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> increase market share; </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> reduction of staff turnover; </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> improve customer retention; </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> increased competitive differentiation; </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> reduced response time; </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> reduced operating costs; </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> increase in sales per customer; </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> improving the use of fixed assets; </font></font></li><li>   ÃÜ; </li><li>    ; </li><li>  ; </li><li>   ; </li><li>   ; </li><li>   ; </li><li>    ; </li><li>   ; </li><li>    ; </li><li>  ÃÜ  ; </li><li>   . </li></ul><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The best value offers provide tangible, measurable results that are highly desirable for potential buyers. Stories are another way to create concreteness, they allow you to get your message across without making any allegations applicable to any case.

Provocative letters </font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The phone should be the main tool with which you are embedded in large companies. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, written messages: emails, faxes, handwritten notes are tools that support calls, and an important part of your toolbox. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Forget about mass mailings.</font></font><br><br><blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> All mail to target customers must be written specifically for who you want to meet. </font></font></blockquote><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> To become attractive to potential customers, your message must meet two criteria: </font></font><br><br><ol><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Excite curiosity, affecting precisely their business problems. </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Designate your company as a competent resource that can change the existing situation for the better. </font></font></li></ol><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Adapt the letter for a specific client. </font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Letters should immediately attract the attention of a potential customer. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And attention begins with the question asked - this is a great way to attract people. </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Mark the goal in the main part of the letter. </font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is necessary to help the client to achieve the desired result, instead of distracting from it. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Use only business vocabulary. </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Strong conclusion. </font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is important to offer the client at least one reason why he would like to take the time to communicate with the author of the letter. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">To attract the attention of target customers:</font></font><br><br><ul><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> show your knowledge of their company; </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> speak business language; </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> tell about your value proposition; </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> write as if you are on an equal footing; </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> make the letter easy to understand; </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> report customer results. </font></font></li></ul><br>  If you follow these principles, it will increase the effectiveness of your correspondence. <br><br><h3>  Chapter 13. Use Email </h3><br>  Some managers spend so much time traveling that email may be the only way to communicate with them.  Properly crafted emails can be a valuable addition to your toolkit for developing new customers. <br><br>  Email requires a different writing style.  Each message sent is recommended to do: <br><br><ul><li>  personalized.  This means that you need to appeal to something very specific in his business; </li><li>  related to business needs.  The letter should be devoted to the problems and challenges of a potential client; </li><li>  concise and informative; </li><li>  containing a reason to start a conversation.  You can ask a question, invite the reader to attend the event or ask if he is interested in receiving additional information on this topic; </li><li>  readable from the preview window.  Good emails convey a message quite quickly; </li><li>  not containing expressions typical for spammers (free, secret, true, increase, click here, spam, low prices, affordable, special, instant, huge); </li><li>  containing short paragraphs, including no more than two or three sentences; </li><li>  Easy to read from the screen, for which you must use the appropriate font (Verdana, Arial or Helvetica). </li></ul><br>  Fortunately, if you disregard style considerations, good e-mails are almost identical to well-written traditional messages (see the previous chapter).  An important difference is the subject of the letter, which must be tempting. <br><br>  It is assumed that the use of e-mail in implementation strategies will grow rapidly.  If you learn this technique before anyone else, it will give you an advantage. <br><br><h2>  Part IV.  Break through the barrier </h2><br><h3>  Chapter 14. Become compelling for key managers. </h3><br>  Any salesman should be ready to talk with a real person every time he calls customers.  When you know the beneficial difference that you are capable of creating, you become confident that you deserve the right to distract these important people. <br><br>  Practical tactical ideas: <br><br>  <b>The organization of a favorable environment.</b>  Clean the table so as not to be distracted.  Let the plan of what you will say lies before your eyes.  Make sure you have paper and pen. <br><br>  <b>Combine calls.</b>  Take a couple of hours to make all the calls at once. <br><br>  <b>First make insignificant calls.</b>  Leave calls to the most desirable buyers for later, because at the very beginning the probability of fooling is especially great. <br><br>  <b>Refine your goal.</b>  Clearly define what you want before you begin. <br><br>  <b>Identify the interlocutor's keywords.</b>  Difficulties, problems, worries, questions, bottlenecks, challenges, disappointments - all of these are opportunities to get into their company. <br><br>  Be calm and confident.  After all, you want to be so represented on the other end of the wire. <br><br>  If the interlocutor says that he has a couple of minutes or that the time is quite appropriate, then you have received permission to start a conversation. <br><br><ol><li>  Establish trust.  Consumers should feel comfortable and feel that you are a reliable resource (recommendations, preliminary analysis, key event). </li><li>  Arouse curiosity.  Let them know about the business results achieved by your other clients, raise critical issues that your company's companies face and that are related to your offer, etc. </li><li>  Conduct a dialogue.  Ask questions.  The best kind of questions is provocative.  They stimulate the interlocutor to express their views on business problems. </li></ol><br><blockquote>  The main rule: never try to convince potential customers that you have a ready-made solution.  Instead, ask questions to demonstrate in-depth knowledge of their most pressing business problems. </blockquote><br>  Learn more about direction, goals, and critical success factors.  Curiosity is good!  Stay on the line while you have a lively conversation.  When you feel that the other person is interested, this is the right time to suggest the next step.  The most important thing is to tell you what positive changes you can bring to their business. <br><br><h3>  Chapter 15. Overcome obstacles, eliminate objections </h3><br>  The main problem is not objections, but that you do not foresee them well in advance and you risk being caught off guard.  Vendors succeeding in today's market, carefully think through all their future steps.  They never act spontaneously.  Focus on the outstanding issues, not what you sell.  Having finished speaking, do not be silent in anticipation of questions from a potential client.  Another aspect that you need to tackle is the exact adaptation of your proposals. <br><br>  Here are some tips on how to deal with the most common obstacles: <br><br>  <b>We are satisfied with our supplier.</b>  Think about your competitor's weakness.  Maybe he demonstrates low efficiency?  Is lazy?  Spread the boundaries of your thinking to identify possible business problems and the ensuing consequences. <br><br>  <b>What do you sell?</b>  Is it possible to overcome this situation?  Only if you can return to discussing their problems, challenges, goals, initiatives and bottlenecks. <br><br>  <b>Send me a brochure.</b>  Sending a brochure is a waste of time and effort of all participants.  That is why it is better to move on to the real issues that are on the agenda.  Return the conversation to your value proposition. <br><br>  <b>We are too busy now.</b>  This technique requires some provocation on your part.  Sometimes it is difficult if you do not know the true value of your offer for their business. <br><br>  <b>It is too expensive (difficult, complicated).</b>  If you talk about such things as the unprofitability of staff turnover or a six-month reduction in the product development cycle, you will never hear such objections. <br><br>  <b>You have five minutes - say, time has gone.</b>  Focus on the business problems that you solve for your customers, and the results that you provide.  You might even want to tell briefly how they helped a particular customer. <br><br>  <b>There is no money in our budget.</b>  You need to meet with the right manager before approving the budget to make sure that your proposal will be included in it. <br><br>  <b>We have a long-term contract with the supplier.</b>  You can wait until it expires, or choose a penetration strategy, finding a gap in the offer of competitors and stubbornly aiming at cooperation. <br><br>  <b>We work only with an approved list of suppliers.</b>  ‚ÄúEvery organization on the list of approved suppliers is there because someone in your company thinks they offer worthy solutions.  That's why I'm calling you. ‚Äù <br><br>  Think of the objections that you regularly encounter.  Analyze which of your actions may cause problems for you.  In addition, you should record and work out their arguments. <br><br><h3>  Chapter 16. Turn the ‚Äúgatekeepers‚Äù into helpful ‚Äúdoormen‚Äù </h3><br>  Your task is to convince the ‚Äúgatekeeper‚Äù to put you inside without telling about your product.  Their help can turn into an invaluable asset.  How not to communicate with the "gatekeepers": <br><br><ul><li>  never lie or try to hide a part of the truth; </li><li>  never use scare tactics; </li><li>  talking to the secretaries, do not consider them fools; </li><li>  never leave the answer. </li></ul><br><blockquote>  The golden rule: treat the gatekeepers with the same respect as decision makers. <br></blockquote><br>  When secretaries filter calls addressed to their bosses, they want to know who you are, why call and whether the manager is waiting for this call.  All these questions you must have answers.  When the ‚Äúgatekeepers‚Äù understand that you are focused on their immediate business problems, they become your allies.  Please note that you need to immediately find out the name of the "gatekeeper."  This is important because it shows respect.  Do not forget to thank the secretaries for the advice, because they are not obliged to help you. <br><br><h3>  Chapter 17. Do not let your campaign fade away. </h3><br>  Remember: it takes at least 7-10 contacts to be in the field of view of your potential customer.  Stop earlier and all your efforts will be wasted.  To avoid the role of a beggar, you should always have a strong business reason to call.  I can say with confidence that one contact once a week or once every two weeks is enough. <br><br>  <b>Organize a storage system.</b>  You should have as many customers as you can hold in memory at the same time. <br><br>  To demonstrate your best side when they call you back, it is important to understand what a potential client is expecting from you at the moment.  When you are called back, your answer should sound as if there was no break between the previous contact (email, call) and today. <br><br>  Assuming that you contact the customer once every ten days, your campaign may last three to four months.  Having not achieved any success at the end of this period, one must look for it elsewhere.  But do not delete this corporation from your list.  If you are not given a clear rebuff, do not give up.  It is very likely that this is just a matter of priorities. <br><br><h2>  Part V. Promote the sales process </h2><br><h3>  Chapter 18. Make the first meeting impressive. </h3><br>  You have decided to give it to him, because a potential client believes that you can solve his problem or help him achieve the desired business results.  When you speak, they think about it. <br><br>  <b>Avoid idle chatter.</b>  If you are trying to convince potential customers that your product is what they need, you are digging a hole for yourself. <br><br>  <b>Discuss business results.</b>  When decision makers ask how you did it, speak briefly and convincingly. <br><br><blockquote>  Your goal is to go straight to questions to find out as much as possible about your potential client. <br></blockquote><br>  <b>Develop thoughtful ideas.</b>  Instead of trying to tell you how ideal this solution is, position it as an opportunity that needs to be explored in more detail. <br><br>  <b>Provide important information.</b>  After you share the information, start asking questions again. <br><br>  Well-planned, thought-provoking questions lead to strong relationships with corporate buyers - and ultimately to an increase in the number of contracts.  By asking serious, customer-focused questions, you can: <br><br><ul><li>  demonstrate your positive intentions; </li><li>  increase your credibility; </li><li>  help customers think and evaluate the situation; </li><li>  identify needs and work on them; </li><li>  form the right decision. </li></ul><br>  It is absolutely necessary to make a list of ten questions and take it with you to the meeting. <br><br>  <b>Focus on the current situation of the client</b> and match it with the problems that you solve, or with the goals you are helping to achieve.  Never ask for information that is easy to find in the public domain. <br><br>  <b>Take hold of their problems.</b>  If you are truly customer oriented, you should ask questions about what is wrong. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ss/6q/fz/ss6qfz00esgqmyafycma9a0veju.png" alt="Client's current situation"><br><br>  When customers talk about their difficulties, show curiosity and learn about it as much as possible.  In particular, find out why they consider voiced a problem. <br><br>  <b>Study the impact on business.</b>  Ask questions that will cause the interviewee to study the implications of the methodology they are currently using. <br><br>  After you have studied the impact of difficulties on your clients' business, <b>it is time to determine the winnings</b> that they will receive from solving their problems. <br><br>  Good questions are the key to turning disappointed potential customers into active buyers who want to solve their problems. <br><br><h3>  Chapter 19. Gain momentum and keep up the pace </h3><br>  A conversation with a potential client does not start at the moment when a representative of the company you are interested in picks up the phone, and not when you enter the office.  The conversation begins when you develop a plan.  You have to make a lot of mental effort before you can get to the meeting. <br><br>  When selling large companies need to move forward in stages.  The first meeting can be considered successful only if you finish it with a specific result that will ensure progress in the relationship.  Before you leave, schedule the next meeting to keep up the momentum.  If this is not done, then it will be almost impossible to return - even if they like you. <br><br>  After the initial contact, due to lack of time, there are still more questions to be discussed.  You will also need time to sort out the information received and come back with some ideas.  You can offer to call or meet with their superiors, subordinates, technical experts, users or employees of the finance department.  You should agree on a time to talk (meeting) with an industry specialist, technical expert, manager or someone else from your company. <br><br>  Below are the steps to follow which will ensure the productivity of the first conversation with the client (remember that an effective transition is part of your plan): <br><br><ol><li>  Start a conversation (5‚Äì10 minutes) <br><ul><li>  mutual presentation </li><li>  confirm time and agenda </li></ul></li><li>  Conduct dialogue (40‚Äì45 minutes) <br><ul><li>  create context (5 minutes) </li><li>  go to questions </li><li>  focus on business issues (35‚Äì40 minutes) </li></ul></li><li>  Bring the process to a new stage (5‚Äì10 minutes) <ul><li>  sum up your understanding of the situation </li><li>  suggest the next step </li></ul></li></ol><br>  The more you can do to ensure the correct course of your meeting, the better.  The active position helps to eliminate problems and does not allow wasting time in vain.  Here are some more suggestions on how to make a meeting successful: <br><br><ul><li>  call to confirm the appointment; </li><li>  send a tentative meeting plan; </li><li>  Do not bring brochures to the meeting. </li></ul><br>  Sit back in your chair.  This will help you to remain in the image of a consultant and will not allow you to start advertising your product. <br><br><h3>  Chapter 20. Tune for Success </h3><br>  When switching to a new method, be indulgent to yourself.  To really rethink your role as a seller, your offer and your customer, you will need time.  Do not wait for ideal conditions to move forward, otherwise you will never make progress.  If you consider everything you are doing as an experiment, you cannot fail. <br><br>  <b>Save the best for later.</b>  Instead of getting a contract with the most needed client, call the less significant client for you.  They are the safest place to practice, and this is exactly what you need right now. <br><br>  <b>Keep studying.</b>  Sometimes what is effective for one person is completely different for another, so you will need several different approaches.  Always keep learning and developing. <br><br>  <b>Use all available resources.</b>  There is no reason for you to do it alone.  Involve others to find out exactly what benefits.  Learn from the professionals, use their knowledge. <br><br>  <b>Take responsibility.</b>  If you blame others for your problems, you can never achieve anything.  As soon as you touch on what interests them, the doors of the company will open for you. <br><br>  <b>Play role-playing games, even if you hate them.</b>  The only way to get rid of errors is to rehearse the situation.  Then you will not be embarrassed, talking with a client, and you can become much more successful. <br><br>  <b>Conduct a conversation analysis after each call.</b>  Effective sales is just a skill.  When you focus on improving it, you improve. <br><br>  Competitors are able to quickly create identical products, but no one can be your copy and repeat your way of thinking.  Your ability to provide a continuous stream of fresh ideas and information for corporate buyers will make you irresistible, valuable, and ultimately irreplaceable. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/424587/">https://habr.com/ru/post/424587/</a></p>
