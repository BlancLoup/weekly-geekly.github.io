  <section class="page js-page"><h1>New year with new features</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/65c/b4a/cca/65cb4acca47942378d0f1d40878ca27b.jpg"></div><br>  The system of accounting for loans and automation of MFO <a href="https://saascredit.ru/">SaaS Credit</a> from the company <a href="https://doslab.ru/">DosLab</a> appeared on the software market relatively recently, but it has already gained recognition and great popularity among representatives of the microfinance business.  The reason for success lies in the optimal combination of advanced functionality, simple integration and operation, as well as narrow specialization, which takes into account all aspects of microcredit.  Due to these features, a software solution at minimum cost and in a short time frame provides comprehensive automation of MFIs, which can significantly increase business efficiency and reduce risks. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  However, the higher the functionality of the product, the higher the possibilities for its expansion.  Therefore, the company ‚ÄúDosLab‚Äù conducts continuous work on the development of the complex and the addition of new features.  Much work has been done in this direction over the past three months.  The results of this work, clients using this software for MFIs, can be estimated right now. <br><br>  The main attention of developers was focused on finding effective solutions to minimize the risks of microcredit.  An important step in this regard was the creation of a new multi-stage scoring system using automatic decision-making algorithms, which is most interesting, above all, for online MFIs.  In addition, the following types of checks of potential borrowers were introduced into the scoring system: <br><br><ul><li>  verification of the borrower on the basis of the Federal Migration Service, </li><li>  check of judicial debts on the basis of the Federal Bailiff Service, </li><li>  check of the borrower on the basis of Rosfinmonitorig. </li></ul><br>  Another very important check of the borrower was also introduced, which is simply indispensable for online MFIs issuing loans by crediting to a bank card.  Thanks to the new function, the borrower's bank card itself is available for verification.  In particular, it can be used to verify transactions carried out on the card, determine whether the card is in the database of other MFIs, and also reveal facts of past crediting to a bank card.

      In addition, recently microfinance organizations using SaaS Credit have received another important opportunity to minimize risks.  This was made possible by the DosLab company concluding a partnership agreement with EquiFax, the largest international bureau of credit histories.  Now checking the borrowers on the basis of EquiFax has become available directly from SaaS Credit.  This bureau has an extremely broad base of several million borrowers, and also offers the possibility of additional checks and automatic scoring. <br><br>  Also, the developers added features that make it easier and more convenient to account for loans, as well as work with borrowers using SaaS Credit.  So recently was introduced the function of IP-telephony.  It allows employees of a microfinance organization to make telephone calls with borrowers directly from the interface of their workplace in the automation system.  Also, the functionality of the complex allows you to save recordings of telephone conversations with their subsequent listening. <br><br>  This is only a part of the implemented improvements and new features.  More innovations await SaaS Credit users in the near future.  DosLab Company is actively working on the development of the product, taking into account the needs of customers.  Thanks to the extensive experience of specialists, all user requests are embodied in new developments.  The strategic plans for 2016 include the introduction of a wide range of features and functions that no competing product can offer. <br><br>  The MFI program is delivered in the SaaS Credit Cloud cloud solution format that is most convenient for the maximum number of clients.  However, there is also a SaaS Credit BOX packaged solution that provides for the purchase of software with its installation on the MFI server.  This allows us to offer the best automation option for each client, regardless of their preferences for using the software. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298738/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298738/</a></p>
