The truth is usually this simplicity is expressed in the fact that a newbie quickly creates an advertising campaign and happily squanders all the money without a serious return. <br><br>  Especially dangerous are beginner internet marketers, endowed with an unlimited budget, but having a plan for the leads that advertising systems should bring.  Because the only way to increase the number of fillings on the site that they know is to throw more money into the furnace of the advertising system.

Lida start to cost less - especially if the chiefs who have gained experience, along with the number of new interests, add to the marketer a budget savings plan. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  From the point of view of the marketer, everything is fine.  He made five hundred interests in a month, fulfilled the plan, did not exceed the budget.  You can spend a premium on something good. <br><br>  And then these five hundred leads get into the sales department.  Managers begin to ring them and slowly boil like kettles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9ce/0b3/c41/9ce0b3c41954480f86169a3344d70afd.jpg"><br><br>  Because the quality of interests does not hold water. <br>  Half - individuals who will get well if one license.  And that, only after much deliberation and the extrusion of technical support. <br>  Another third about the product is no longer remembered.  They just liked the ad, under the influence of the impulse they clicked and filled out the form.  And they forgot. <br><br>  So it turns out that in fact there are very few good leads, you have to look for them in a pile of garbage.  And the bosses are pressing on the department, they say, they gave you so many contacts, where is the money? <br><br>  You can, of course, the marketer in the plan to put not the interests, but sales.  But then marketers will already scream.  They will immediately say that they have no levers of pressure on salespeople, and why should they remain without a premium because someone does not know how to talk to customers. <br><blockquote>  All this is happening because in most companies the data in CRM does not contain any data on the lead history.  The maximum is the original campaign (and very general: "Adwords", "exhibition", "mailing of May 12").  And what specific keywords and ads led to the generation - no one knows. <br>  And if they knew, it would be possible to analyze where the interests from individuals come from, which ads form poor-quality interests, and which ones form effective and quickly closing. </blockquote><br>  So I once realized that I could not effectively manage the separate generation and separate sales.  It was decided to create a simple analytical system. <br><br>  For a start, a simple goal was set - to add information about a specific ad to CRM.  Then it would be possible to build reports - which ads are effective and generate job leads, and which ones are garbage. <br><br>  The first obstacle is that Adwords and Metric, taking care of the privacy of users, do not give out information about specific conversions, you can access only general statistics.  Therefore, it is necessary to collect such data manually. <br><br>  <b>This is done quite simply.</b> <br><br>  When you first visit our site, the original Adwords or Direct campaign is retrieved from the UTM tag and stored in a cookie. <br>  When a user sends us a completed form (and this may not necessarily be the first time you visit the site, but the third or fifth one), the information from the cookie about the source company is sent to CRM along with the name, mail and phone number. <br><br>  Further in the CRM, each interest (and subsequently the transaction) sales managers after the primary call the assessment. <br><ul><li>  0 - the person does not remember us at all, although he filled out the form; </li><li>  1 - there is no phone in the interest; </li><li>  2 - it was interesting to control the staff at the time of filling out the form, now it is not relevant; </li><li>  3 - I will do the installation sometime later; </li><li>  4 - an individual; </li><li>  5 - relevant for a month; </li><li>  6 - relevant in the near future; </li><li>  7 - ready to purchase soon. </li></ul><br>  Based on the ratings, we determine which campaigns and ads are effective and which are not.  Useless disable, working leave. <br>  Then we select successfully closed deals and for announcements that generated interests for them we raise rates. <br><br>  What did I get as a result of introducing such a system? <br><ol><li>  We only pay for the advertising that really brings results. </li><li>  Marketers can experiment.  Want to - add new ads, change keywords.  After 2-4 weeks, you can evaluate the effectiveness of these changes.  What works leave to remove the rest. </li></ol><br>  Now in development is the next generation system, which will automatically operate with the rates in Adwords and Metric.  And this will increase work efficiency and reduce the burden on the internet marketer. <br><br>  And ultimately it will increase the efficiency of our business. <br>  What and your business wish! <br><br>  Andrey Ignatov </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299948/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299948/</a></p>
