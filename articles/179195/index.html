  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Action / Result / Conclusions or just add time</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Not once there are farewell in the form of "Action -&gt; Result -&gt; Conclusions."  It is necessary to act.  Get the result.  Draw conclusions.  And so on the cycle.  Usually, pictures in the style of ‚Äúthe mass of beautiful and confident people‚Äù are added to this.  Everyone around is happy.  Everything was fine.  Generally, a complete idyll. <br><br>  And indeed, it works.  Things are being done.  The development is on.  But, sometimes something starts to go wrong.  Or there is a feeling of something missing.  Sometimes rare.  Sometimes often. <br><br>  For example.  You start to write a program (code it hard).  Get the result (in fact, the program itself, reviews, etc.).  You draw conclusions (what to change, what not to do, etc.).  Begin to do the following things.  In fact, all is well.  The program is written.  The next one will be even better. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

      <br>
      And now let's imagine that you start somewhere at the end of the development of the first program to write another program.  So the circumstances.  Those.  There is no result from the previous action.  And there are no conclusions, and you are already starting the next action. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  By the time you get the result and draw conclusions on the first program, a piece of the second program will be written.  If the findings of the first program remind ‚Äúwhat a fine fellow I am,‚Äù then everything will be fine.  And the second program will be successfully written. <br><br>  For example, the findings of the first program are more like ‚Äúrewrite unambiguously!‚Äù.  Those.  You think that this is not worth doing anymore.  What happens in this case.  You will begin to look at the code of the second program with "distrust" and the desire to modify.  This will affect your mood (you are already disappointed in the correctness of the code).  May affect the timing (for example, you will begin to rewrite a new manner).  May affect the results and conclusions (for example, you decided to continue in the old style, since a third is written). <br><br>  In the end, it turns out that the results and conclusions can be quite ambiguous.  Sometimes useless.  And maybe the mood will deteriorate. <br><br><h4>  One  Two.  Three..... </h4><br>  The situation in the previous example is not very good.  But, you pull up your pants.  Say "figs with him, it happens."  And with eyes full of desire, begin to act further. <br><br>  Now imagine that there are a lot of tasks, and they appear at random times.  You do not rush to redo after each withdrawal?  Otherwise, with time, you will begin to remind all these funny pictures about ‚ÄúI made a project‚Äù. <br><br>  The situation is quite real.  For example, at the end of the project there are rush jobs.  Or simply the requirements change frequently for the tasks at hand. <br><br>  You can divide everything into very, very simple and small tasks.  But, you can even go so far that for each pair of lines of code you will draw conclusions.  Somehow, too, is not good. <br><br>  You can just continue in this spirit.  But, then the effectiveness of the results and conclusions will decrease dramatically, as the tasks will begin to weave.  Everything will merge into a chain, when in the middle of the action you begin to draw conclusions and evaluate the results.  Because of what you will change the actions themselves or make other conclusions for completely unrelated tasks (for example, you are frustrated by some architecture, and under the influence of negative emotions, you change the architecture of another program, although the architecture was originally chosen correctly).  And so on. <br><br><h4>  Job.  Friends.  Personal life. </h4><br>  Let's remember that you are not a robot.  And you have other aspects of life.  Socializing with friends.  Personal life in the end.  But in each of these paths of life has its own tasks.  Their problems.  Its results.  Its findings. <br><br>  It can be both good and bad.  And everything that you do, understand, receive, also affects other paths of life. <br><br>  For example, you just unimaginably rested yesterday.  So, what do you dance?  And a good mood will affect your actions and conclusions.  As an option, you will positively evaluate the results, and easily deal with things.  I think it is easy to guess what will happen if you had a scandal with flying saucers / forks / chairs / sofas the day before ... <br><br>  You can certainly learn to abstract or jam in yourself.  And then you will each time take the risk of breaking, and throw out everything that has accumulated. <br><br>  You can learn to manage your own emotions.  And live in constant bringing yourself to balance. <br><br>  You can roll into Tibet.  The option is good, but I think not everyone can go this way.  Yes, and in time it is also not very fast. <br><br><h4>  Time </h4><br>  Time.  It is never enough.  It is not replenishable.  We are constantly trying to do something with it.  More effective to use it.  Fill it with events.  Brighten up.  Make something useful.  Or vice versa to chat with legs from the edge of the sofa.  It's hard to imagine that you are lying in bed, not moving, and just counting seconds / minutes / hours / days ... You will still do something. <br><br>  Let's try to imagine that between each of the steps ‚ÄúAction / Result / Conclusions‚Äù you add the ‚ÄúTime‚Äù item.  Just "time."  Without specifying the timing, restrictions, expectations. <br><br>  Now we have a buffer between steps.  What can this give us? <br><br>  First of all, there is no time limit in this buffer.  It means the possibility of moving something. <br><br>  Secondly, in this buffer there are no restrictions.  This means that there is no need to adapt to something, and the possibility of arbitrary formation of its content. <br><br>  Thirdly, there is no expectation in this buffer.  This means the absence of some supertasks and expectations of the magic arrival of aliens. <br><br>  Now each such chain can easily get along with another chain, simple changes in the buffer. <br><br>  Take the first example.  I will remind you.  Two tasks.  You start doing the second task at the end of the first task.  If you don‚Äôt really want to put a buffer between writing a program and putting it in, then you are quite capable of putting a buffer between the results and the output.  Let's do it.  In the end, it turns out that the conclusions on the first task will not necessarily affect the second task.  Suppose we push the conclusions of the first task to the end of the second task.  In this case, it turns out that we calmly and in time complete the second task, and then we draw conclusions.  In this way, we saved time / strength / mood. <br><br>  This example is rather small and very abstract.  And in it you can put a lot of conditions so that the buffer will be completely unprofitable.  Therefore, I will give an example more complicated. <br><br><h4>  Example </h4><br>  Suppose there is a certain person named Innokentiy (Kesha).  He works as a programmer in the production of web-sites.  It simultaneously weighs 4-5 orders.  He works hard.  Constantly trying to apply new knowledge.  Constantly evolving.  Why periodically swears on its own code.  Sometimes he has to shuffle large chunks of code. <br><br>  He likes to go to bars with friends, ride a bike, hang out in clubs.  To live an active lifestyle.  Why periodically gets into different binders. <br><br>  He has a girlfriend (Barbara) with whom they occasionally quarrel, as their characters are in some ways just the opposite. <br><br>  Sometimes in the evenings he puffs over his own project, which so far does not bring anything but communication with users. <br><br>  Take a week out of life. <br>  Situation.  Today is Monday.  The deadline for one of the projects is the day of Thursday.  Under this project, he is somewhat in a hurry, as he does not have time.  A new project will arrive on Wednesday morning, and on Friday it must be handed over.  In parallel, there is a third project.  On Friday evening, scheduled gatherings with friends in the bar. <br><br>  <i>An example, of course, will be taken from the novel.</i>  <i>This is an attempt to bring to life.</i> <br><br><h5>  Monday. </h5><br>  Half day Kesha devoted to the third project.  He wrote slowly and thoughtfully.  The second half of the day was devoted to the first project.  He wrote quickly and with flaws, sometimes scoring on some clumsy code.  I had to stay for half an hour.  All the way he tried to figure out how to finish the first project.  Returning home, he was met by Barbara.  She was tired of his periodic delays at work.  Sometimes so long that it began to seem to her that Kesha was not particularly faithful to her.  They had a not very pleasant conversation.  And she decided to play for jealousy, and hint that she communicates very well with Valera. <br><br><h5>  Tuesday. </h5><br>  All morning Kesha recalled Valera.  I remembered how much time they spend with Barbara, and how well she communicates with him.  His mood was faded.  And he definitely decided that he should scare Barbara by the fact that he is popular with girls.  Kesha started a third project.  But things went very slowly.  He could not think of anything beautiful.  Therefore, half-written code.  In the afternoon, he persuaded one of the employees, who lived not far away, to walk with him to his house.  The second half of the day Kesha scribbled the first draft, sometimes not paying at all.  He was very nervous to be sure to have time to show his beloved female interest in him.  He lingered for an hour.  I called what will be in 15 minutes.  And he went to the front door in 40 minutes to be sure that Barbara would look out the window.  Before parting, he pointedly embraced and kissed the employee on the cheek.  The evening was very scandalous. <br><br><h5>  Wednesday. </h5><br>  All morning Kesh was impressed by yesterday‚Äôs conversation.  Because of that, I did not listen well to the production of the second project, and missed the details.  To somehow get away from thoughts.  He without hesitation began to write a second draft, without paying due attention to the little things.  Towards evening he came to his senses and sat down to write the first draft.  Because of this, he had to stay at work for three hours, since tomorrow is delivery, but the project is not ready yet.  On the way home, he remembered his project, and his promise to himself at least once every few days to write something for his project.  The evening was very cold and irritable. <br><br><h5>  Thursday. </h5> <br>  All morning Kesh finished the first project.  And closer to the day it turned out that there was a blunder in the sound moments, because of which he had to urgently insert the crutches.  Since the customer does not know IT, but apparently everything continued to work, the project was successfully handed over.  With horror in his eyes, he began to rewrite the second draft in order to correct the mistake.  Periodically, he was visited by thoughts of their conflict with Barbara.  The third project went completely away.  He lingered for several hours at work.  The evening was cold again.  Being on edge, he tried to prove that she was to blame for everything.  And this only fueled new controversy. <br><br><h5>  Friday. </h5><br>  All day Kesh scribbled the second draft.  And in the late afternoon I saw that the sound bug was actually solved much easier, and there was no need to completely rewrite it.  Having opened the TZ to check once again whether he completed everything, he found that there were a number of details that he did not even touch.  Again began crutches, crutches and crutches.  Taking into account that the correspondence has added new difficulties, the matter dragged on.  Until very late, he finished writing the project, but did not have time.  The client did not understand where the delay came from, but nevertheless agreed to wait until Tuesday, given that the additional functionality will be implemented free of charge.  And again, the third project was ignored.  From work, he went to meet with friends.  The conversations were not fun.  Kesha complained about his life. <br><br><h5>  Saturday. </h5><br>  Kesha came in the morning.  And lay down to sleep.  Waking up in the evening, he saw a text message saying that Barbara went to relax with the girls in the club.  All evening Kesha walked.  Attempts to sit down for their project were given very hard.  Therefore, the rest of the evening Kesha spent watching a movie. <br><br><h5>  Sunday. </h5><br>  Only in the afternoon Varvara returned.  Again there was a heated argument.  In order to somehow refresh himself, Kesha went cycling around the city.  The mood was at zero.  In the evening he tried to establish relations with Barbara.  A little better, but they have become.  Although the precipitate was felt at night. <br><br>  For especially impressionable.  Everything had been fine and good :) <br><br><h5>  Total </h5><br>  But seriously, everything could be different.  Let's figure out where to put the time buffer, and how it would help. <br><br>  The first and most obvious point.  This is a relationship.  If Kesh had postponed the statement with a Monday conversation, and in the end he would not have done unnecessary actions, then he would not have had such a strong negative at home all week.  On Friday, he would not drink until the morning.  And the weekend would have spent with Barbara.  And also I could normally listen to the staging of the second draft. <br><br>  Second moment.  The first project, if the result had been postponed, i.e.  delivery of the project on Thursday, the timing of the second project could be postponed much easier and without additional efforts. <br><br>  Third moment.  If Kesh had postponed the conclusions with the bug, it might not be the best way, but a second project would have been made on time, even if it was not beautiful.  And perhaps he would have found without correspondence everything and everything ‚Äúthat simpler‚Äù way of solving the problem. <br><br>  The fourth moment.  If Kesh had postponed work on the third project, and adjusted the deadlines, then he would have more time to implement the first project.  Those.  would postpone the action. <br><br>  It is clear that Kesha is a man, and that it would also be difficult to postpone everything.  But, even adding a time buffer at least at some points in the development of events, his situation would become easier. <br><br>  PS This is not a call to stretch all your affairs to impossibility.  This desire to show the reverse side of quick results. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/179195/">https://habr.com/ru/post/179195/</a></p>
