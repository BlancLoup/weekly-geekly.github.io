At first it was unusual to digest unfamiliar things (for example, mate. Statistics, which should have been only six months later), but this did not become an obstacle.

      ‚ÄúWe have to work not 12 hours, but head.  But if the head does not work, then work a lot. ‚Äù  Everything difficult can be taken effort, which, in principle, I did. <br>  The main thing is not to be afraid of difficulties, as some do, and if somewhere really cool and cool, then go there without thinking about obstacles. <br><br>  In the first semester, we studied web-technologies and algorithms and data structures, and these subjects put brains into place very nicely.  Knowledge of web technologies (servers, protocols, frontend technologies) is used every day, and AIS provide an understanding of the work of ready-made libraries, which helps to optimize work. <br><br>  In the second semester, we wrote a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/mailru/blog/177953/">game server</a> , designed databases and studied HighLoad: we learned how to handle the load, wrote our own static web server and compared it with nginx. <br>  Perhaps this is the most unique 3 courses.  Where else will students write their own browser Tanchiki in the classroom, like Dandy, and then they will be hacked into them as part of manual testing? <br><br>  In the recently completed third semester, we sank into <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/mailru/blog/181368/">business and systems analysis</a> with a screech, learned to design user-friendly user interfaces, learn methods of protection against hacking and attacks, and also plunged into the limitless world of testing and integration. <br><br>  Technopark is not only lectures, seminars and exams.  This is, above all, communication with leading experts. <br><blockquote>  Members of the group were offered to work on their own scientific projects, and Jobs decided to assemble a digital frequency meter, &lt;...&gt;.  For this, he needed the parts that HP produced;  he picked up the phone and called the company president directly. <br><br>  "&lt;...&gt; He answered, talked with me for twenty minutes, sent the necessary details and offered work at the plant ..." [Isaacson 2012, 40] <br></blockquote><br>  Uniquely: take and get advice from CISO Mail.Ru Group in person or by mail. <br><br>  Special attention should be paid to the fact that Technopark actively participates in organizing internships at Mail.Ru Group.  All my techno-band mates work for Internet companies, the vast majority, of course, at Mail.Ru. <br>  Two months ago I also came to the company for an internship: I work on the <a href="http://tp.mail.ru/">tp.mail.ru</a> portal and various internal developments of Technopark.  In my opinion, the purpose of the internship is not to apply all the knowledge that we were given (there is no HighLoad on the Technopark portal yet), but learn how to work in a team, get into the spirit of development and, again, pick up best practices from our colleagues.  Then there will be growth. <br><br>  Interview.  Of course, the tasks that will quickly bring to light anybody.  For me, the biggest problem has always been the speed of the solution, and when it is necessary to give an answer relatively quickly, the answer is spinning in my head, but you cannot say.  In Mail.Ru Group, you will always come across the path to a solution, and you will not get stuck in the swamp of your own thoughts.  I think this is productive. <br><br>  The first working day was spent in the old office in the business center "Avion".  After one and a half years of communication with the Mail.Ru Group employees at the Technopark, a little less than anything, I was very familiar and familiar.  Embedding in a new team and immersion into the corporate atmosphere went smoothly and unnoticed. <br><br>  The Mail.Ru Group is very liberal with interns.  The main thing is the completed tasks, so the schedule is flexible, a little more than full.  The office is open 24/7.  This allows you to fully study at the university and close the session perfectly well. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fed/c7c/17c/fedc7c17c00af6fd37923f61d9cbb5ba.jpg" alt="image" align="left"><br>  Working in a large company does not make people "helpless waste material with a slave-consumer mentality," as Pavel Durov wrote earlier.  Having been in the Mail.Ru Group environment, I did not notice anything negative;  the desire to live, develop and create only increases, but, of course, everything depends on the person.  Again, if you sit in a closet under the stairs and write startups, failure will not teach you how to come to success: you consolidated your experience in failing startups.  So I decided to go dear through a big company, through the environment of already established developers.  Time will tell. <br><br>  <i>27 floors of the runet.</i>  <i>Dream.</i> <br><br>  In the end, I would like to make my 5 kopecks in the "holy war" about higher education in Russia.  Yes, there are problems, but this is not a reason to leave or scold the country.  Problems are somehow solved, because there are those who are interested in solving them. <br>  Technopark Mail.Ru - a living example.  An education seeker in Russia will always find it. <br><br>  I think those who have training experience in similar projects will agree with me - and, perhaps, share it in the comments. <br><br>  Thank you, Mail.Ru. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/186962/">https://habr.com/ru/post/186962/</a></p>
