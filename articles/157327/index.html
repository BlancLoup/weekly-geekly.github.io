  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Apple failed to defend iPhone trademark rights in Mexico</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/484/4f9/add/4844f9add53a5278243caadf48cb16a8.jpg"><br><br>  In Mexico, it seems that judges are able to reasonably think and make rational decisions.  The fact is that Apple lost the lawsuit for the iPhone trademark in Mexico.  The iFone trademark was registered by the eponymous Mexican company iFone back in 2003, in addition, it is the only company in Mexico that has the right to use the iPhone trademark.  Registration of the iFone trademark was made 4 years before Apple released its smartphone.  But in some other countries, Apple won almost similar lawsuits, and the court did not pay attention to the fact that other companies registered their trademarks long before the iPhone appeared at least in the form of a working draft. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  The lawsuit with the Mexican telecommunications company lasted from 2009, it was then that Apple filed the first lawsuit on the iFone, trying to prove that this company has no right to use the word iFone (and part-time, iPhone), because the words iFone and iPhone are very similar in sound , and the rights to the iPhone brand belong to Apple.  However, the Mexican court did not take into account the words of Apple lawyers (although the claim was considered for three years), and decided the case in favor of the Mexican company.  As a result, Apple not only failed to win a lawsuit about the iFone brand, but now can‚Äôt use the iPhone trademark.

      Of course, representatives of the iFone positively evaluated the work of the court.  And lawyers say that now the Mexican side has every chance to sue Apple, demanding to prohibit the sale of devices that violate the rights of iFone.  In addition, Mexicans may require Apple to compensate for the damage caused to the company by selling a third party (Apple) of goods violating the rights of the iFone. <br><br>  Perhaps Apple will go to the world, and will try to license the brand of iPhone from Mexicans.  But this will obviously not happen soon, and after all, fifth-generation Apple smartphones began to enter Mexico a couple of days ago.  Probably, on this occasion, we will soon hear a lot of interesting things. <br><br>  This is the second time in the next few weeks, when Apple loses the lawsuits.  It is worth recalling that not so long ago, a UK court ruled that Apple should officially apologize to Samsung by publishing the corresponding apologies on its own website and in several of the country's largest newspapers. <br><br>  Via <a href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/120475-Apple-Cant-Use-The-iPhone-Name-in-Mexico">escapistmagazine</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/157327/">https://habr.com/ru/post/157327/</a></p>
