In some cases, such a move, on the contrary, will adversely affect the learning of many students.  However, a qualitatively new education can be obtained by the student independently. <br><br>  For a school or an institute, as a system, changing the learning process is quite difficult.  Some teachers introduce an element of novelty, but this happens infrequently.  However, in the new year, much will depend on the students themselves - on how much they themselves can change their educational process.  And in this, students will be helped by various tools, products, resources.

      2015 will be the year of the student. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  The changing role of the student </h3><br>  The mention of the word ‚Äúschool‚Äù or ‚Äúinstitute‚Äù immediately causes a vivid picture for most young people, middle-aged people and the elderly: there is a certain room where the teacher stands at the blackboard and tries to bring knowledge to his students.  The teacher plays a major, dominant role in the whole process. <br><br>  Nowadays, on the contrary, the role of the student is changing.  From a passive participant in the learning process to a student who complements and expands his or her mind and education process is one step.  Now students can work on their own projects, where they need creative thinking, the ability to solve problems, the ability to work in a team.  In general, all that is required in the 21st century. <br><br>  The result is a quick acquaintance of the student with the real world, and this acquaintance will no longer impose a negative imprint on the former dreamer about a beautiful life, as students were 10 years ago.  A modern student knows that everything is not easy, and something can be obtained only after hard work. <br><br>  At the same time, the opportunities for learning in the modern world are extremely wide.  Even a five-year-old child can learn to program, with proper learning.  Now some young (and not only young) people study so fast that they become more professional than their own teacher ‚Äî and, well, before the completion of the learning process.  Already few people can be surprised by the news about young people who have created large companies, or who have settled in large companies to work, even at the initial courses of the institute. <br><br><h3>  Learning for a student </h3><br>  If the student‚Äôs role is central, the main one, this will allow new trends to develop in all parts of the educational system.  Now there will be no conflict of interests between the administration, parents and the entire educational industry.  Instead, teachers will become advisors to students, instead of being superiors.  Also, teachers will be more likely to be interested in the recommendations of the students themselves. <br><br>  In addition, now there are more and more educational startups that complement the educational process, and quite significantly. <br><br><h3>  What is the result? </h3><br>  As a result, all these changes gradually change the educational process.  It has long been understood that education cannot be the same for everyone, and now every student can complement the foundation with what he likes.  At the same time, leaving the school, a student who really wanted to learn.  not only prepared for work, but also prepared for the perception of this external world, with all its shortcomings and virtues. <br><br>  In addition, the modern world is changing very quickly - and now students themselves will be able to keep up with the times, even if the usual educational system lags behind.  According to some experts, more than 65% of current students will work in specialties that do not even exist yet. <br><br>  And every student, student, will be able to prepare himself for his work and life himself.  This is the future. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/283822/">https://habr.com/ru/post/283822/</a></p>
