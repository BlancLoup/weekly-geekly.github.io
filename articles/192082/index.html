Sales of smartphones for 2014 will amount to more than 1 billion units.</b> </h4><br>  According to IDC, sales of smartphones for the first time will exceed the volume of 1 billion already in 2014.  Cumulatively, sales of smartphones and tablets will exceed PC sales at a ratio of 3: 1 in 2013 and 5: 1 by 2017.  Such a rapid spread of smartphones, in turn, will lead to a ‚Äúboom‚Äù in the mobile Internet and an increase in marketers' interest in this advertising channel.  From now on, if marketers want to be first, their strategy should be mobile. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/01f/d44/944/01fd449448e39fae4c59a7ee236e4fb0.gif" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  <b>2. For the first time smartphones will overtake sales of ‚Äúsimple‚Äù phones in 2013</b> </h4><br>  Finally it becomes a reality!  Global sales of smartphones will overtake the feature phones, due to a significant reduction in prices and the spread of 3G / 4G networks.  IDC predicts the volume of shipments of smartphones in 2013 at the level of 918.6 million units, which will be about 50.1% of the total supplies in the industry.  High demand is provided by developing countries with a large population: China, India, Brazil.  Marketers have to fundamentally change their marketing strategies to respond to these radical changes in the structure of user devices and their corresponding consumption patterns.

Mobile devices capture our media attention</b> </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9c5/465/68a/9c546568a26f150a8b0dda61abb2d4ab.png" alt="image"><br>  Mobile Internet users are already spending more time on their devices, even than watching TV.  The average time for using smartphones is 108 minutes from the total 7 hours of media consumption per day, outpacing the use of computers (93 minutes) and TV (92 minutes).  Tablets (37 minutes) occupy the 5th place in media consumption, already catching up with the radio (52 minutes). <br><br><h4>  <b>4. Mobile traffic is growing rapidly, as opposed to mobile advertising costs.</b> </h4><br>  Mobile accounts for 15% of total Internet traffic and its share is growing, on average, by 50% per year (and most likely, the growth rate will only accelerate).  However, advertising budgets are not in a hurry to follow mobile device users.  Even countries with developed mobile advertising, such as the United States, the discrepancy between media influence and advertising costs of about $ 20 billion. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c9e/a8a/e3c/c9ea8ae3c15e8c03fe57c1989d44b9a0.png" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a96/297/629/a962976291129ea8ccfcce15fd1f4f56.png" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  <b>5. Mobile applications left the mobile Internet far behind</b> </h4><br>  The popularity of mobile applications is constantly growing.  Advertising shows in mobile applications account for 75-80% of the total.  According to the survey, 27% of respondents said they used 6-10 applications in the last 30 days.  Be it a brand manager who is looking for a point of contact with consumers or a media planner in search of a target audience - mobile applications will play a major role in this. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3cf/810/69d/3cf81069d4802dd3b6eada76a462b9ff.png" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  <b>6. Multi-screen on the rise</b> </h4><br>  Multiscreening is the phenomenon of simultaneous use by the consumer of more than 1 device.  So, about 62% of consumers combine the use of a mobile device with watching TV.  Among audience 20-34, on average, 69% of consumers are looking for information on their mobile devices that they have just seen on TV.  These facts have a huge impact for marketers, since advertising campaigns can become truly multi-channel and complementary. <br><br><h4>  <b>7. Rich Media formats influence customer engagement.</b> </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6d3/aa5/03a/6d3aa503a6a922e2a4cd4f7850edbcee.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Mobile provides brands with creativity and creative advertising, which is still limited to TV.  Rich Media mobile advertising is up to 4 times more effective than standard banners in terms of CTR.  Also, mobile advertising placed inside applications, on average, is 1.7 times more effective in relation to the mobile Internet.  Rich Media mobile advertising reaches a CTR of 1.53% when it is shown inside applications and ‚Äúonly‚Äù 1.12% on the mobile Internet (which is also a very good result).  For comparison, standard banners have a CTR of 0.39% and 0.32%, respectively. <br><br><h4>  <b>8. Consumers are not against mobile advertising</b> </h4><br>  Brands and marketers are looking for customer interactions through their mobile devices all day long.  Our gadgets are always online, increasing the chances of an advertising message being seen.  According to research, 59% of all users of mobile devices belong to mobile advertising, as well as TV advertising and advertising on the ‚Äúbig‚Äù Internet. <br><br><h4>  <b>9. <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/">Mobile advertising</a> maximizes purchase.</b> </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/db4/88b/50c/db488b50c102e9a4fd1beb62bdf5213f.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Mobile advertising directly affects the behavior of buyers.  According to the survey, 75% of all respondents stated that they discovered something new through their mobile devices.  And almost half (46%) said they bought something using their mobile devices.  And 45% of respondents reported that advertising seen on their smartphones and tablets directly influenced their choice directly in the store.  Indeed, many people are no longer parting with mobile devices, even being directly in front of the shelves with the goods. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/192082/">https://habr.com/ru/post/192082/</a></p>
