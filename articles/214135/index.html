The output models are obtained on the Android operating system with 7.85-inch screens, elegant and slim cases, as well as several times lower price tags.  Many Russian brands have put ‚Äúcloning‚Äù into the stream, although they do not disdain such a campaign and have bigger offices - for example, Acer and MSI.  Yes, and HP not so long ago introduced in China a line of inexpensive Compaq tablets, among which are - that's your time - the ‚Äúclone‚Äù of the iPad mini. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8ff/1dd/7ba/8ff1dd7ba9a8588761c60d27fe76fbed.jpg"><br><br>  In this post, we will talk about the ‚Äúmini-copy‚Äù of iPad mini, namely, the model bb-mobile Techno 7.85 3G. <a name="habracut"></a>  Previously, the bb-mobile brand was engaged in various kinds of unusual gadgets, such as <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/smartgadget/blog/206382/">door eyes with cameras</a> , headsets <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/smartgadget/blog/198570/">in the form of small mobile phones</a> and children's tablets.  The bb-mobile Techno 7.85 3G is also a ‚Äútablet‚Äù, but no longer a child‚Äôs one, but designed for users of all ages.  There are people in the world who like the iPad mini, but who do not want to buy it - because of the price or ideological rejection of iOS.  They are the ones who can recommend the ‚Äúclones‚Äù in general and Techno 7.85 3G in particular.

      Before you go to the review of bb-mobile Techno 7.85 3G, it is worth making a small clarification.  I tested the white version of the tablet for 7,490 rubles, which is completed with a 4-core MediaTek MT8389 processor.  However, there is also a black version in nature for 6,990 rubles with an MT8312 chip of two cores.  Such a "color" version separation, of course, seems a bit strange, but how it really is.  From myself, I note that it is better to take exactly the white modification - it looks much more noble, and with performance, of course, everything is somewhat more interesting. <br><br><h4>  <b>In the box</b> </h4><br>  In the box with bb-mobile Techno 7.85 3G, a lot of different things were poured - here you have a standard set of a network charging unit, a USB-microUSB cable, instructions and a warranty card, and a ‚Äúbonus set‚Äù including a wired headset, a simple case-bag, a rag for wiping the case and OTG-lace. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7e7/a40/bb8/7e7a40bb872fa3c00b23cdde5791f8df.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/026/47d/642/02647d64291f85ca80cd9025c60dd7af.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/515/369/1ac/5153691ac52de4c34f42c48decb01528.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/119/056/5d9/1190565d91e0c187a3c93e089df813d0.jpg"><br><br>  I personally was pleased with the equipment, it was pleasant to find not only standard personal belongings in the box, but also such trifles.  Let them cost a couple of dollars. <br><br><h4>  <b>Appearance</b> </h4><br>  The similarity with the iPad mini is really visible, bb-mobile Techno 7.85 3G can be confused with it.  Especially there is the latter located in the cover of the book, hiding the back panel, where there is no logo in the form of an apple.  Buttons in bb-mobile Techno 7.85 3G are located approximately in the same places, but here the speakers are transferred to the back panel, and the microUSB port is on top.  If the user is not satisfied with the complete case, then you can try to choose an option designed for iPad mini.  With proper luck, he will pick up, however, he must have at least the upper part open - so that the bb-mobile device can be charged without removing the case. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2c7/805/101/2c78051019dc959925d8b8a1e789939e.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/811/0e6/842/8110e6842f5820e6a3a9ceb7e99bd767.jpg"><br><br>  In general, the tablet turned out pretty and quite pleasant to the touch.  Design a mess, it is a simple matter, but everything is more complicated with materials.  In this case, the developers coped with the task.  The back of the bb-mobile Techno 7.85 3G aluminum and silver, the rest of the elements are made of milky-white plastic.  In particular, the cap at the top of the back panel.  All this good is really pleasant to hold in your hands, and it weighs almost as much as the first mini, - 320 g instead of 312. To understand: there are exactly the same outwardly "clones" of the Apple brainchild on the market, which weigh more than 400 g. Where such growth comes from - God knows, but he is clearly not benefiting. <br><br>  The spaced volume buttons in bb-mobile Techno 7.85 3G are on the right side of the case.  At the top there was a place for the power key, a 3.5 mm headphone jack and a microUSB port.  The microphone is down here. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b32/b9a/a06/b32b9aa068f3ff066623df8b610a56f2.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b3d/16f/eb3/b3d16feb39f22a4dd0e083b804ad8689.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f25/b16/2e7/f25b162e710756910c4b64b641bb7653.jpg"><br><br>  The panel mentioned above hides a slot for a SIM card and a microSD flash drive.  I tried to insert a 64 GB SanDisk card into bb-mobile Techno 7.85 3G, but the tablet refused to work with it - it is damaged, it says.  So such volumes, alas, are not supported.  A 32-gigabyte flash drive, meanwhile, ‚Äústarted‚Äù without problems. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/046/172/e98/046172e981fdf1838e924fd074da4d55.jpg"><br><br>  Above the screen there was a place for a speech speaker, front camera and LED flashing blue.  It blinks so brightly that it sometimes interferes with sleep (smiley). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/aec/8bf/2b9/aec8bf2b98e732f46d8987eb928f86a0.jpg"><br><br>  In general, I have no complaints about either the body or the ergonomics.  The bb-mobile Techno 7.85 3G is of high quality and doesn‚Äôt cause rejection - unlike many other ‚ÄúRussian‚Äù tablets that, sorry, are sometimes assembled with their feet. <br><br><h4>  <b>Display</b> </h4><br>  In bb-mobile Techno 7.85 3G, exactly the same matrix as in iPad mini is installed - 7.85 inches, IPS, 1024 x 768 pixels.  The quality is high - this applies to color reproduction, and contrast, and the width of the viewing angles, and everything else.  If, of course, you are not confused by the low resolution by the standards of 2014, you will surely be satisfied. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/53e/a42/7b1/53ea427b1bd8d8cb108ea14078dfaf91.jpg"><br><br>  In the settings screen there is an item that allows you to automatically optimize power consumption by adjusting the color gamut. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/928/3df/70a/9283df70a97a3fc01f29c611c0871220.jpg"><br><br>  Multi-touch is supported; up to 5 simultaneous touches are possible. <br><br>  Yes, I almost forgot: on the bb-mobile Techno 7.85 3G screen there is a protective film pasted on, which you can not remove.  And remove - no problem: the matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãcovered with glass. <br><br><h4>  <b>Iron</b> </h4><br>  The MediaTek MT8389 chipset is in many respects similar to the smartphone MT6589.  There are also four 28-nanometer ARM Cortex-A7 cores and an old PowerVR SGX544MP graphics.  RAM in bb-mobile Techno 7.85 3G gigabytes, this is the standard for devices of this class.  In general, the iron is of average level without special claims for serious performance, but sufficient for most everyday tasks. <br><br>  <b>Benchmarks:</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/28e/8d0/7be/28e8d07beeb8d6a77e59ad20e8a0f288.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/333/468/b92/333468b927953cd32d4f3ef6cdcbc3cf.png"><br><br>  "Asphalt 8".  allows you to select any graphics settings - from ‚ÄúVery low‚Äù to ‚ÄúHigh‚Äù.  Often in the budget device the last option is not available. <br><br>  Suddenly, "sticky" in the interface of Android bb-mobile Techno 7.85 3G is not inclined, the device can not be called pensive.  Yes, for really heaped up toys it will not work, but watching the video there and sitting on the Internet via Chrome is fine. <br><br><h4>  <b>Autonomous work</b> </h4><br>  The bb-mobile Techno 7.85 3G is equipped with a 4000 mAh battery, which is not bad: there are tablets on the market in a similar form factor, equipped with batteries with a capacity of 3 500 or even less.  Hours 7 on the model in question can be read, hours 5 - to watch the video.  By the standards of iPads, this is not much, by the standards of "clones" - normal. <br><br><h4>  <b>Connection</b> </h4><br>  The first and most important thing is that using bb-mobile Techno 7.85 3G you can talk like on a regular smartphone.  Of course, a person who has applied a 7.85-inch tablet to his ear looks a bit strange.  But ... Who knows - to whom, when and how such a chip can be useful.  I remember the case when I stayed in the city center (about 5 kilometers away from home) with a discharged smartphone and an iPad that supports cellular networks, but does not allow making calls.  In one store I stuck with a request to charge a smartphone at least a little, in the other one they were always looked at as an idiot and refused.  And to call is very, very necessary.  As a result, I freaked out and bought a Samsung ‚Äúflashlight with phone‚Äù class to make just one call.  So if I were then with Techno 7.85 3G - and the problem would be solved much easier (and cheaper). <br><br>  Talking on bb-mobile Techno 7.85 3G is possible using the bundled wired headset.  Or you can buy a wireless one - both in the Bluetooth ear format and in the form of a small mobile phone (MicrON series from the same bb-mobile).  There is nothing wrong with the quality of voice transmission - there is no difference with smartphones and telephones. <br><br>  The usual dialer is from stock Android.  SMS application too. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d0d/f61/c23/d0df61c235e194d301bc59afc59c2afe.jpg"><br><br>  In bb-mobile Techno 7.85 3G there is a GPS receiver, it works fine. <br><br>  Module Bluetooth and Wi-Fi - by itself.  With them, too, no problems. <br><br><h4>  <b>Memory</b> </h4><br>  The storage capacity is 8 GB, of which about 5 and a half are available.  I described the situation with memory cards above - drives up to 32 GB are supported inclusively.  By OTG using a complete adapter, you can connect keyboards, USB flash drives and mice.  I connected the last two with bb-mobile Techno 7.85 3G, it all worked. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f29/7a1/12b/f297a112b055a5b52b1af97626297ece.jpg"><br><br><h4>  <b>Cameras</b> </h4><br>  0.3 megapixel front, 5 megapixel autofocus at the back.  There is nothing outstanding here, the modules are simpler and give out photos of the level ‚Äúbelow average‚Äù by smartphone standards.  In short, the cameras in bb-mobile Techno 7.85 3G for a tick - as in the vast majority of low-cost tablet computers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5af/ee4/e07/5afee4e0718e0efce63c1e4f8eaffe34.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ab6/78f/683/ab678f683c0d7c13460179c1846624d4.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/eac/7d4/ee0/eac7d4ee007731848225a367daf7966e.jpg"><br><br><h4>  <b>Soft</b> </h4><br>  The current firmware for bb-mobile Techno 7.85 3G turns off the Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean operating system in its original form. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5ca/fba/308/5cafba3084940450ab4521a2306e4b9e.png"><br><br>  I did not find any special improvements from the manufacturer, except for a couple of trifles.  The first - the background of the application menu is not black, but the same as the wallpaper on the screen.  Nicely. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2ca/875/b32/2ca875b321e3f607675b48010b3afcd1.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8f3/cdc/aab/8f3cdcaab84244bdc12caebd5ad80dc2.png"><br><br>  The second is an integrated program for creating screenshots. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/92a/e61/99b/92ae6199b5a98f801f3fa2cc5450a251.png"><br><br>  Well, the file manager is still there. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/218/9eb/3de/2189eb3de80d1b736dbfe2336b9bf77c.png"><br><br>  And so - "naked" Android.  It works stably, does not cause special rejection. <br><br><h4>  <b>Conclusion</b> </h4><br>  I don‚Äôt hide it: I liked the device, as the developers managed to bypass several bottlenecks of similar 7.85-inch Android tablets.  First, the weight in 320 g: there are devices with such form factor and heavier.  Secondly, Android 4.2.2: often in ‚Äúclones‚Äù iPad mini is Android 4.1.  Third, the battery: they could have supplied less capacious, but stopped at 4,000 mAh.  Plus, all this stuffing with wireless modules is also encouraging.  So I can recommend bb-mobile Techno 7.85 3G for a purchase, although, of course, I myself tend more to the original - in fact, iPad mini, and even better iPad mini with Retina.  Although they are much more expensive. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/214135/">https://habr.com/ru/post/214135/</a></p>
