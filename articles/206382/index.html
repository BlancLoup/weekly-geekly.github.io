However, in rare cases, an electronic device is necessary for me.  bb-mobile "GSM Eye" just refers to the number of such useful gizmos. <br><br>  Here is an absolutely real life situation.  A month ago, my grandparents called me.  They looked into the peephole and saw there only a silhouette of a man - the light bulb on the stairwell was unscrewed.  To the question "Who is there?" The visitor said that he was a neighbor from the bottom and came to borrow salt.  In short, the door was opened, and this very ‚Äúneighbor‚Äù, who turned out to be a stranger, soon left the apartment with a thousand hryvnias (about $ 120, 3,000 rubles).  Fortunately, there were no injuries, the money was given voluntarily. <br><br>  It‚Äôs useless to search for this comrade - my old men‚Äôs vision (well beyond 70) wasn‚Äôt very good, the thief wouldn‚Äôt have bright eyes, and no one really remembered how he looked.  Now is the time to return to the device called bb-mobile GSM eye.  It is intended to avoid situations like the one described above.

The first "Eye" (he was called) was brought to the Russian market in March 2012, and since then the model has sold around the country in an edition of 10 thousand copies.  Today, in the line of bb-mobile there are three devices of this type: "Super Eye", "GSM Eye" and "Program Eye".  The last two are notable for the fact that they actually have a built-in mobile phone (about its capabilities just below).  The latest model also has a large touch screen - with a diagonal of 5 inches.  The first two have screens of 2.7 and 3.5 inches, respectively.  Since my grandparents do not need GSM-options, for them I took ‚ÄúSuper Eye‚Äù - I‚Äôm just taking it to NG, and for myself I purchased ‚ÄúGSM Eye-eye‚Äù.  I will also tell about it in this post, the benefit of the curious moments suffices. <br><br>  An important advantage of the "Eye" - ease of installation.  Personally, I can drive a nail into the wall, but I‚Äôm not going to make holes in it and lay the wiring - it‚Äôs not a woman‚Äôs thing, will you? :) ‚ÄúGSM Eye-eye‚Äù doesn‚Äôt require it: it is inserted into the hole from an ordinary eye (diameter - from 12 to 58 mm), and the thickness of the door should not exceed 100 mm.  Fasteners are included, so do not have to buy more. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/912/6b4/852/9126b485291b3264c7f18c1f8da99cb8.jpg"><br><br>  Installing the device took about 10 minutes, of which about 5 I was looking for a screwdriver.  While I fixed the "Eye" in the most simple way, that is, without screwing the screws into the door, but even if I were engaged in this, it would hardly take more than half an hour to "install".  The installed GSM Eye is as follows: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/764/b67/444/764b6744402a36f883419d1059d4cd37.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/635/b9a/8ca/635b9a8caab0db7e9d29accbdcb7560e.jpg"><br><br>  Looking outside the module with a camera, infrared light (this is a question of working capacity in the dark - for example, when some suspicious person unscrews the light bulb on the platform), a motion sensor, a light-sensitive sensor, a microphone, a speaker and a bell button. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/07e/9df/4fa/07e9df4fae509795094201a9c6d898ce.jpg"><br><br>  The panel, located on the inside of the door, bears the display, battery compartment, memory card and SIM card, speaker, microUSB port, microphone, Reset key and three control buttons - on / off / back, screen activation. , "Call" (the latter is necessary to start the dialer application). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ec1/83a/984/ec183a984d5957af20773668ca495bd5.jpg"><br><br>  The screen of the model, as I said above, is 3.5-inch.  It is sensory and made by resistive technology.  The quality of the matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãnot too high (I mean the color rendition and brightness), it processes clicks in 9 out of 10 cases, but for a similar gadget it is normal - in Angry Birds you don‚Äôt play on it and don‚Äôt watch movies. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dad/ba8/afd/dadba8afda54da4fb857e09f9a7d81f2.jpg"><br>  <i>Desktop "GSM Eye"</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/578/ae1/6af/578ae16af44e040e1e184eb34c2a36a5.jpg"><br>  <i>Main menu "GSM Eye"</i> <br><br>  The interface of the ‚ÄúEye‚Äù is simple, it is not difficult to understand.  The key place in it is occupied by a virtual button for selecting modes.  There are three of them: the first is called ‚ÄúAnswering machine‚Äù, the second is ‚ÄúHome‚Äù, the third is ‚ÄúGSM‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dfb/020/159/dfb0201591827f153bf522545f34002b.jpg"><br>  <i>GSM Eye mode selection menu</i> <br><br>  In the first case, after pressing the call button, the device makes a photo / video and says something like a beautiful female voice: ‚ÄúTo leave a message, press the call button again and speak after the signal.‚Äù  After that, the visitor can either press the call button again, or do nothing.  If the visitor presses the call button again, a beep will sound.  Video recording will last 10 seconds. <br><br>  The second mode - which is ‚ÄúHome‚Äù - is intended for use when you are in an apartment.  After the visitor clicks the call button in this mode, a beep will sound on the internal module, then the screen will automatically turn on and the user will be able to see what is happening behind the door.  At the same time, the device will take a photo or record a video - depending on the settings. <br><br>  After pressing the button in the GSM mode, the device will take a photo / video and still with the same beautiful female voice (sorry not for men :)) will offer to contact the landlord by pressing the call button again.  Further, ‚ÄúEye‚Äù will call the owner at the telephone number set in the settings, and the visitor will be able to talk to the occupant of the dwelling.  To do this, in ‚ÄúGSM Eye‚Äù you must first install a SIM-card and set your phone number.  You can also make calls to the card installed in the ‚ÄúEye‚Äù card (and they will only be received from one of the three specified numbers, that is, an outsider on the ‚ÄúGSM Eye Eye‚Äù will not get through).  The device automatically picks up the phone and you hear what is happening in the apartment.  For example, did a cat die of starvation while you bask on Turkish beaches?  But I hope that you do not leave the cat alone for the period of your vacation, right? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9b6/21a/bc3/9b621abc34d8e80f1297a228e4c3a505.jpg"><br>  <i>"GSM Eye" dials the number to contact the visitor with the owner of the apartment</i> <br><br>  However, in the ‚ÄúGSM‚Äù mode, the device can not only make calls - it can also send SMS or MMS.  To enter the MMS settings in the menu there is a special item.  True, I did not test this option - in my phone I haven‚Äôt set up receiving MMS at all, so I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to accept the photo card anyway.  But, I think, problems with this will not arise. <br><br>  Some examples of the photo.  In my opinion, for the device this kind of quality is acceptable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b41/453/d78/b41453d78d9970a7d83eebb497a37cd4.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/066/caa/ffa/066caaffae63096963b9e5072b81148a.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/521/1e3/c2f/5211e3c2fa18c0782e9abd430f8a0e4f.jpg"><br>  <i>A zombie is bursting into the apartment with headcrab on the head!</i> <br><br>  And yes, the user can at any time to see what is going on behind the door - even if no one called her. <br><br>  Camera resolution in the ‚ÄúGSM Eye‚Äù is 2 megapixels.  However, it is recommended to set 0.3 in the settings - it is likely that pictures will be saved faster.  The maximum video resolution is 640 x 480. <br><br>  Immediately after the first activation of the ‚ÄúEye‚Äù, you should set the exact time and date in the settings.  The fact is that photos and videos are saved in the format ‚Äú20130324-151228.jpg‚Äù - this is, in particular, a snapshot taken at 15 hours 12 minutes 28 seconds on March 24, 2013.  If the time / date is set incorrectly, then you will not get the correct information about the time of the visit. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b18/dc0/cfc/b18dc0cfc7817302d8622c9cca793022.jpg"><br>  <i>Settings menu</i> <br><br>  The point "Movement" stands apart.  You can set up a motion sensor in it so that it automatically illuminates the bell button if someone is standing behind the door, and also photographed / filmed a video and turned on an alarm if someone is swarming at the door for too long (say, 20 seconds - the time is set in settings).  In fact, an important point: it would be better for the apartment owner to find out that someone has been hanging outside for a long time ... <br><br>  One more thing.  With GSM Eye, you can manually make voice calls with a SIM card inserted into it.  Perhaps this option is useful if you have lost your phone somewhere within the apartment. <br><br>  In general, the device is definitely worthy.  Perhaps the location of the doorbell button on the door will seem a bit strange (nevertheless, it is customary to hang up calls next to the door), but this is perhaps the only serious minus ‚ÄúGSM Eye‚Äù.  And for me personally, he is more than compensated by the lack of the need to drill holes in the walls and lay the wiring - as mentioned above, the installation of the device, I, the girls, took about 10 minutes.  The described thing is not cheap - about 6 thousand rubles.  But there are cheaper options (and more expensive) - see table: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a9a/94b/275/a9a94b27512bb071e2c83ad5a8af9b19.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/206382/">https://habr.com/ru/post/206382/</a></p>
