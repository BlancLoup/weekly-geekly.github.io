The ‚ÄúNokly‚Äù times are long past, the ‚Äúbackbone‚Äù of Chinese brands has been organized, the quality of the devices of which does not cause or doubt and squeamish rejection.  These include such brands as: Zopo, JiaYu, ThL, UMI and of course OPPO and MEIZU. <br><br>  The hero of this review, the updated version of the JiaYu G3 smartphone, which has long been known, has had time to recommend itself with high quality and even better performance, in spite of not the highest price.  The review of the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/165381/">old</a> model has already been made long ago by one of the habrovchan.  Today I want to devote a review of the new model, namely JiaYu G3S.  Consider with you what new was offered to us, let's make comparisons and draw conclusions, the new model is just as good as the previous model, or ‚ÄúThe grass used to be greener‚Äù. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

The box is very reliable, during transportation no dents appeared on it.  The manufacturer claims that it can withstand up to 100 kg of load, I did not check this fact, in the end I do not review the box. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f0c/c30/d54/f0cc30d548b3c5a348e9ff1365022e77.png"><br><br><h5><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2f2/98a/f25/2f298af25bfce8f4a5c4081d0e0f57ef.png">  " Equipment: </h5><br><ul><li>  1x Smartphone </li><li>  1x Battery (2750 mAh) </li><li>  1 x USB cable </li><li>  1x Charging (1A) </li><li>  <s>Waste paper</s> (Instruction and warranty card) </li><li>  1x Case - bumper * (* not included in the official package, was purchased separately, the price is about $ 5) </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e8b/1d2/ebe/e8b1d2ebe551cc9dd45c960ae326c8e1.png"><br><br>  It is impossible to call a complete set rich, only everything necessary is included in it, it can be safely attributed to the drawbacks of the device, although often online stores give various kinds of gifts to customers.  It is a pity that the set does not include headphones, but knowing what quality they would be, it is not a pity.  The quality of accessories is not satisfactory.  The case was <s>purchased</s> donated by the store, a very nice addition to the purchase.  In total there are 4 colors of bumpers (black, blue like mine, brown, lime), a very high quality of the bumper, even a little surprised, all the holes match perfectly, the cover closes the volume swing and the power button, while the pressure on the buttons did not leave much, The case sat down from the first time, tight enough. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a82/bd5/9e8/a82bd59e824cef9e5f0ef150e002105c.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4bc/a8f/0a3/4bca8f0a371c8782cac16ebaefb2fc04.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7f3/5f1/4a4/7f35f14a4b00f855978a790f80800666.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cf8/355/226/cf83552264903cb680bd8734d20da496.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/42b/1b5/f65/42b1b5f6568f66754795abcddb55128e.png"><br><br>  I think a separate paragraph should be devoted to the battery (one of the reasons for buying this device).  It is big, really big and in size and volume.  2750 mAh, this is not a joke.  Full volume is enough for 3 days of active use (Internet surfing for 1-3 hours, 1-2 music, 1-2 games, a couple of calls), if you reduce the time spent sitting on the Internet and do not listen to music, then I think it will last all 5 days, maybe more.  (The screen backlight is about 75%, Wi-Fi is on).  So we can safely say that the declared volume is honestly implemented in this battery. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/487/6a5/25a/4876a525aa8d08ac3f03cbff7a9e82c3.png"><br><br><h5><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c5a/6ea/467/c5a6ea467529cd999a6349836f2e7693.png">  Design and ergonomics </h5><br>  <i>"The taste and color of all the markers are different" (A.S.Nepushkin)</i> <br>  I really liked the design (this is the second reason for the purchase).  It's no secret that the design of the smartphone is somewhat similar to the HTC One.  For certain reasons, I did not want to buy it, for whom the reason is interesting, I can indicate it.  I did not even want to buy a copy of HTC, I do not like fakes.  And this smartphone looks original, and at the same time very stylish. <br><br>  The chassis of the hull is made of metal, as I indicated earlier.  The front panel has 2 inserts which, by analogy, are also made of metal, and have a rough but pleasant soul texture.  The screen is covered with second-generation Gorilla Glass (and this is the third reason for buying), ‚Äúthe wrong feelings with film‚Äù forced us to buy a smartphone with tempered glass.  As a result, the rear protects the cover, the front glass, which will significantly affect the durability of the appearance.  Marky screen, but on the other hand, from whom it is not mark? <br><br>  In terms of dimensions, the device was clearly mistaken for a year, although in principle, where would you like to shove such a capacious battery?  And on the other hand, I have long been a fan of the brick industry and the happy owner of Nokia 5230 (thickness 14.5 mm), SE Xperia X8 (thickness 15.0 mm), so for me it is even thinish (only 10.8 mm). <br><br>  There are no complaints about ergonomics, the device fits comfortably in your hand, even with a case, although the screen is not small, the fingers of one hand are enough to control what is happening on it.  In the lower part there are three illuminated touch buttons, a power button on the top and a 3.5mm jack, on the right side of the volume swing, on the bottom of the USB and a microphone, the left side is free as the hero of the song by Valery Kipelov.  For me personally, the lock button is not located at the most convenient place, I am very used to how it is conveniently implemented in the Nokia 5230, at the bottom of the right end, I will not take this to the minuses, because this is a purely subjective opinion.  Above on the metal inset settled: voice sensor, light and proximity sensors, as well as warning light indicator and camera (2 MP). <br>  The design of the back of the smartphone is also not lame, it looks succinctly and practical.  Moving from top to bottom, you can find: a camera (8 megapixels), a flash, <s>an apple</s> grass logo, an inscription with the manufacturer's name, a speaker, looking ahead, I‚Äôm saying that it‚Äôs loud enough, but spoiled by an unsurpassed sound quality, does not allow it to rate above 4 of 5. The device lid fits snugly (although some on this model have an uneven snapping in), it is not very marking, you can say in moderation.  The camera is a millimeter or protrudes beyond the case, but since the case is dressed, this is not a problem. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/094/3f5/03a/0943f503a4468d424eed34601357f539.png"><br><br>  Under the cover are slots for 2 SIM cards and micro SD card. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/941/f9b/721/941f9b7211860e62e516ce38a5ef8e89.png"><br><br><h5><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/929/811/8fd/9298118fda96b17cc6da1cf85605cc63.png">  Hardware </h5><br><br>  Well, now "the most delicious."  The device is based on the quad-core processor MTK6589, which has worked well in other devices, not only of Chinese origin.  It has 4 cores operating at a frequency of 1.2 GHz, with the architecture of Cortex A7. <br><br>  Video accelerator Imagination Power SGX544, there are no comments here, because one of the flagships of the Samsung galaxy S4 market is equipped with the same, though there are 3 of them and their frequency <s>is 2 times</s> higher.  But there were no problems in games even with one video accelerator, everything goes, everything flies more precisely, Asphalt, Modern combat, GTA, and others <br><br>  RAM 1 GB, the user is available 500MB.  This is certainly not 2GB, but I have never had the feeling that there is not enough memory.  Today, 1GB is enough for 95% of tasks.  Built-in memory 4 GB, the user is available 2.5 GB.  External memory can be supplemented up to 32 GB.  Interestingly, without a memory card, the phone refuses to do a lot, for example, to take pictures, it is worth considering when buying. <br><br>  There is more than enough performance for the device, the lack of power is not felt, the smartphone is fast and does not slow down.  Below are the results of testing in Antutu, and their comparison with the results of the old model. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/535/99a/977/53599a977ac8a1234b0dcb92fa2480ec.png"><br><br>  As a phone, JiaYu G3S can offer support for two SIM cards, one of which can work with 3G networks.  It is worth considering that the phone is equipped with only one radio module.  The reception of the signal is good, there were no problems with the connection, the quality of communication is high, the interlocutor is well heard, me too.  Unfortunately, there are no photos from the Wi-Fi and GPS test, but in words, Wi-Fi supports b / g / n standards.  After 3 concrete walls, the signal was steady, the speed was high, as far as I don‚Äôt know, but the YouTube video at 720 loaded quickly and did not slow down.  GPS has been used only once, and then indoors, for the test.  For a minute I caught 8 satellites, and continued to search. <br><br>  Music lovers like me should like the smartphone.  The sound quality in the headphones is very high, even in a standard player, and if you also adjust the equalizer, you can even use cheap headphones. <br><br>  A few words about the screen.  The touchscreen is responsive, soft, the screen coating does not in the least prevent the finger from sliding on the surface, the matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãgorgeous, the color rendition is excellent, the viewing angles are very close to zero.  HD resolution (320 dpi) further aggravates the picture.  I have no complaints about it, the best matrix of all the devices that I had. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9e3/807/fa9/9e3807fa973d7dca68117b7e91f5ba55.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dac/346/08d/dac34608dab973f94d6ec51e1df620c3.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5cc/286/add/5cc286add5489005c3d705b49765b013.png"><br><br><h5><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/931/b34/fbc/931b34fbcc5cb3e00f4f70974104bc93.png">  Camera </h5><br><br>  I think the camera should devote a whole section (this is the fourth reason for the purchase).  There are two cameras in JiaYu G3S: the back one is 8 megapixels and the portrait one is 2 megapixels, the latter can be used to communicate via Skype, the quality is at the level of a laptop camera, it is quite usable.  With the back camera, not everything is as good as it seemed, the quality is 7-8 out of 10. I can not say that I am not happy with it, but something better could be put into a device of this class.  I wanted to take test photos on the street, but the weather decided otherwise, so for now I can show photos taken indoors indoors during the day.  (How to make other photos, update) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/318/3cd/a30/3183cda30d7b2b154386a6a00e01ebc6.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f35/bba/ae4/f35bbaae4ef972424342a208c82b273b.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/26a/e2a/008/26ae2a00807d16a294f74ca70c1033e9.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a13/61b/e6a/a1361be6aec9cefeb615bd0c29f2cdc5.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/22b/db3/ec2/22bdb3ec24aba6deda48103f6ef9eb10.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/302/174/664/302174664493b6a3562eac800f6556e0.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4d9/f58/379/4d9f58379fe3b4de79c49d0bf5be1053.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/602/78e/da2/60278eda206b3e606ec102df4f663331.jpg"><br><br><h4>  UPD # 1 </h4><br>  Below I attach a screenshot of the battery consumption.  During the time of use, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt deny myself anything‚Äù and played every day, I heard music, and I downloaded quite a lot of applications from the market. In general, I‚Äôll say that the load was just like usual everyday use. <br>  I also installed MiHome Launcher which imitates the MIUI firmware interface, it looks very good, but the ergonomics of control is not lame, although there are complaints about performance, there are moments in which I would like more quick work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/71d/bc5/bf9/71dbc5bf9ed98dcc5b1f727cea3c3c47.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e7b/854/669/e7b8546695db196e76f23d9fa7b8ca9f.jpg"><br><br>  <b>+ Added some more photos from camera</b> <br><br><h5><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dcc/c4d/ca5/dccc4dca5eca0292d5ac45888cf3ac14.png">  JiaYu G3 Comparison </h5><br>  Major changes from the previous model touched the hardware.  The <b>S</b> model is equipped with a more powerful quad-core processor MTK6589 instead of the old, less powerful dual-core MTK 6577, the chassis of metal instead of plastic.  We can say that the hardware was <s>upgraded</s> , <s>and since the case is perfect and does not need to be improved</s> , the rest of the device showed itself perfectly, it was decided not to make changes to this structural element. <br><br>  I probably already tortured readers with letters, so I propose to evaluate the pros and cons of the device and make a result. <br><br><h5><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b3d/ce5/b10/b3dce5b10f75ce7e661b22b0d8788747.png">  Pros: </h5><br><ul><li>  2750 mAh rechargeable battery </li><li>  HD, IPS, Gorilla Glass 2 coated matrix </li><li>  Powerful MTK6589 processor </li><li>  Metal chassis </li><li>  Device design </li><li>  Price </li></ul><br><h5><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/209/93c/688/20993c688f208c3d50a6e96023eb9ef2.png">  Minuses: </h5><br><ul><li>  Poor grade </li><li>  Not the best camera </li><li>  Average speaker quality </li></ul><br><h5><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5af/ff1/985/5afff19853f9636e45e39bed49f643b6.png">  Total </h5><br>  If you start from the price / quality ratio, then JiaYu G3S will be a little equal.  Stylish design and excellent ergonomics, seasoned with excellent features and valuable, makes the purchase of this device very justified.  The work was done on the bugs with the JiaYu G3 model, so the problems and the jambs of this device are almost absent, but as far as the ‚ÄúChinese‚Äù are concerned, the audience will treat it more biased than the eminent apparatuses. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/188820/">https://habr.com/ru/post/188820/</a></p>
