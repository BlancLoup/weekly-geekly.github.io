By the speed of transmission of ideas, this equates them to a telephone conversation.  However, emails are stored on mail servers and are used as printed evidence of our words.  Therefore, electronic correspondence requires a responsible attitude. <br><br>  The task becomes more difficult if you communicate in non-native English with representatives of other cultures.  In this article, I will share what to look for in this case, how to avoid mistakes and achieve mutual understanding with foreign colleagues and partners. <a name="habracut"></a>

    <h2>  Etiquette </h2><br>  Regardless of with whom and in what language you conduct correspondence, do not forget about the rules of email etiquette. <br><br>  1. Clearly specify the subject of the letter (Subject). <br><br>  According to a study by the Radicati Group agency, business representatives receive up to 80 emails per day.  How to convince to read exactly your letter?  Make a headline that fully reflects the content.  The clearer what is being discussed, the faster the interlocutor will read the message. <br><br>  <b>No</b> : ‚Äú <i>Idea</i> . <i>‚Äù</i> <br><br>  <b>Yes</b> : "H <i>ow to boost online sales by 15% by the end of Q4 2017"</i> . <br><br>  2. Use a professional greeting and avoid familiarity. <br><br>  <b>No:</b> ‚ÄúHey‚Äù, ‚ÄúYo‚Äù, ‚ÄúHiya‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>Yes</b> : ‚ÄúDear‚Äù, ‚ÄúHello‚Äù, ‚ÄúHi‚Äù. <br><br>  3. Re-read the letter before sending.  Errors and typos will negatively affect your image in the eyes of the interlocutor. <br><br>  4. If you enter into a correspondence a new interlocutor, briefly describe the background to the question.  Do not make it scroll down and read all the posts on the topic.  Describe the essence of the question, what was discussed, what do you want to say about it. <br><br>  5. Reply to messages.  If you do not have time to conduct research on the topic, confirm that the letter has been received, and indicate when you can address the issue. <br><br>  6. Do not use red color to draw attention to the idea.  Red speaks of danger and causes negative emotions.  For highlighting, use special words and phrases, not graphics or color: <br><br><ul><li>  <i>I would like to underline</i> ‚Üí I would like to emphasize. </li><li>  <i>I would like to draw your attention</i> ‚Üí I would like to get your attention. </li><li>  <i>Please pay attention</i> ‚Üí Please note. </li><li>  <i>Please note</i> ‚Üí Please keep in mind. </li></ul><br><h2>  Lecture hall </h2><br>  English is the universal language of communication of people from different countries.  But this does not mean that the style of correspondence will always be the same.  Consider the differences. <br><br><h3>  China, Japan, Arab countries </h3><br>  When communicating with colleagues and partners from these countries, especially at the beginning of the acquaintance, use the most polite forms.  Each letter begins with a polite greeting and forms of etiquette, for example: <br><br><ul><li>  <i>Hope this email finds you well</i> ‚Üí I hope you are fine, </li><li>  <i>Sorry for bothering you</i> ‚Üí I apologize for distracting you. </li><li>  <i>Might I take a moment of your time?</i>  <i>‚Üí</i> Can I borrow a minute from you? </li></ul><br>  Use the most polite request forms: <br><br><ul><li>  <i>I would be grateful if you could ...</i> ‚Üí I would be very grateful if you could ... </li><li>  <i>Could you please be so kind ... ‚Üí</i> Be so kind ... </li></ul><br><h3>  Germany, United Kingdom </h3><br>  Reduce the modality of phrases, but do not abandon polite forms and forms of etiquette: <br><br><ul><li>  <i>Shouldn't you hesitate to contact me.</i>  ‚Üí If you have any questions, please contact <br></li><li>  <i>I would appreciate your help in this matter.</i>  ‚Üí I would appreciate your help. <br></li><li>  <i>I await a response at your earliest convenience.</i>  ‚Üí Answer as soon as possible. <br></li></ul><br><h3>  USA </h3><br>  Omit etiquette forms, unless you communicate with a colleague or partner above you.  Clearly describe what happened and what you need.  The smaller designs with <i>would, could, might</i> , the better. <br><br><h3>  Africa, South America </h3><br>  If you are already familiar with a colleague or partner from these countries, ask how he is doing, how his family is doing.  Appeal to personal is not perceived as a bad form, on the contrary, helps to establish a good relationship. <br><br><h2>  Language principles </h2><br>  Consider the general principles of writing an email. <br><br><h3>  Shorten </h3><br>  In business correspondence there is no place for speech figures, complex structures and compound times.  The main task of the letter is to deliver your message without loss.  Therefore, everything that can make it difficult to understand must be removed. <br><br>  <b>Not</b> <br><br>  <i>You can remember that he was in his funny room.</i>  <i>It was not a problem.</i>  ‚Üí You probably remember John, whom we met at the conference, he was wearing his ridiculous jacket and he was talking loudly.  I recently asked him how he was doing, and he replied that he was working on a very interesting project and asked me to help him. <br><br>  <b>Yes</b> <br><br>  <i>John Johnson is working for his company.</i>  <i>He proposes his subcontractor on the project.</i>  <i>‚Üí</i> John Johnson is currently working on a new affiliate program for his company.  He invited us to become a contractor for this project. <br><br><h3>  Avoid jargon </h3><br>  Avoid jargon even if you communicate with colleagues who understand the question.  Your correspondence can be sent to people who are not familiar with the topic. <br><br><h3>  Pay attention to the title, name and gender of the interlocutor </h3><br>  In Russian, everything is simple: Ivanova is a woman, Ivanov is a man.  In English, it's not so simple.  For example, Jody Jonson, is it a man or a woman?  Last name will not tell us anything.  Moreover, the name Jody is carried by both men and women: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cbe/365/576/cbe36557684251973b279ef08e847564.png"><br><br>  If you are not sure who your interlocutor is, check with your colleagues, find his account on social networks.  Calling Mr Johnson Mrs Johnson will put you in an awkward position. <br><br><h3>  Discard jokes and personal comments </h3><br>  Strictly formal style is not mandatory, but it is important to sound professional. <br><br><h3>  Remove prepositions where possible </h3><br>  A large number of prepositions make it difficult to understand and create the ‚Äúwater‚Äù effect in the text.  For example, instead of ‚ÄúMeeting the first of December on the topic of marketing strategy‚Äù, write <i>The December 1 Marketing strategy meeting</i> ‚Üí ‚ÄúMeeting on the marketing strategy of December 1‚Äù. <br><br>  Instead of phrasal verbs, <i>come up with</i> - think up, and <i>find out</i> - find out, use their simple synonyms, <i>generate</i> and <i>determine</i> . <br><br><h3>  Avoid exclamation marks </h3><br>  It is difficult to convey emotions through email.  An exclamation in the text is perceived as an increase in tone. <br><br>  If there are many exclamation marks in the message, they are depreciated.  The interviewee will cease to perceive them as a call to pay attention. <br><br><h3>  Limit yourself to five sentences. </h3><br>  According to Guy Kawasaki, if the message consists of less than 5 sentences, it sounds rude, if more - this is a waste of time. <br><br><h3>  Use short words, sentences and paragraphs. </h3><br>  This principle is especially relevant for those who work with mail from a phone or tablet: you need to quickly read the letter, understand and respond, the screen size introduces restrictions.  The shorter the text in the message, the faster it will be read. <br><br><h3>  Discard the passive voice </h3><br>  <b>No</b> : <i>The information was sent by Peter</i> ‚Üí The information was sent to me by Peter. <br><br>  <b>Yes:</b> <i>Peter sent me this information</i> ‚Üí Peter sent me this information. <br><br><h3>  Use lists </h3><br>  If you are interested in the opinion of a colleague on the issue and offer him a choice from alternatives, list them in the form of a numbered list.  Otherwise, you risk receiving a one-word <i>Yes</i> in response.  The other party wants to quickly reply to the message.  It is more convenient for him to say yes, no, or indicate the number of his favorite version.  In other situations, lists structure text and help understanding. <br><br><h3>  Put the deadline </h3><br>  If you need feedback on a specific date, specify it in the letter.  This disciplines the interlocutor, and he will not delay with the answer. <br><br><h2>  Letter structure </h2><br>  An e-mail consists of five semantic parts: <br><br><ol><li>  Greeting. </li><li>  Message. </li><li>  Closure. </li><li>  Parting. </li><li>  Signature. </li></ol><br>  Consider the standard phrases for each part. <br><br><h2>  Greeting </h2><br>  Use the words <i>Dear, Hello, Greetings</i> (if you are not familiar with the interlocutor) and <i>Hi</i> (closer to informal). <br><br><h2>  Message </h2><br>  This is the most informative part.  In it we give information, give details, argue, offer ideas, etc.  Consider useful phrases for different message types. <br><br><h3>  How to open a message </h3><br>  Use neutral phrases for everyday communication with colleagues and formal phrases for messages to superiors, customers and partners. <br><table><tbody><tr><th>  Formally </th><th>  Semi formal </th><th>  Neutral </th></tr><tr><td>  I am writing to ... <br>  I am writing to ... </td><td>  Just a quick note to tell you that ... <br>  A short remark ... </td><td>  Thank you for your mail ... <br>  Thanks for your letter‚Ä¶ </td></tr><tr><td>  In accordance with your request ... <br>  According to your request ... </td><td>  This is to ... <br>  This letter is to ... </td><td>  Thank you for your mail regarding ... <br>  Thank you for the letter regarding ... </td></tr><tr><td>  We refer to our mail regarding ... <br>  Referring to our letter regarding ... </td><td>  I want you to know that / you about / ask you if ... <br>  I wanted to inform you that ... / tell about ... / ask you ... </td><td>  In reply to your mail ... <br>  In reply to your letter‚Ä¶ </td></tr><tr><td>  I am writing with regard to ... <br>  I am writing about ... </td><td></td><td>  Referring to your email dated ... <br>  Citing your letter from ... <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Thank you for your e-mail of (date) regarding ... <br>  Thank you for your letter from (date) ... <br><br></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>  I would like to know you ... <br>  Referring to our phone conversation on Friday, I would like to inform you that ... <br></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>  I am writing to enquire about ... / in connection with ... / to let you know that ... / to confirm ... <br>  I am writing to find out / I am writing in connection with / I am writing to report on ... / I am writing to confirm ... <br><br></td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>  How to clarify the deadline </h3><br>  Specify the hour and time zone.  Without this, the deadline is blurred and perceived as a wish: <br>  <i>Please submit your report (reply) on 10 March, EOB CET</i> ‚Üí Please send your report / answer on March 10 before the end of the working day, Central European Time. <br><br><h3>  How to ask and give details </h3><br>  Give details: <br><table><tbody><tr><th>  Formally </th><th>  Neutral </th></tr><tr><td>  We would also like to inform you ... <br>  We would also like to inform you about ... <br></td><td>  I'll keep you in the loop. <br>  I'll keep you up to date. </td></tr><tr><td>  In answer to your question (order) about ... <br>  In response to your question (request) about ... </td><td>  I'll keep you posted. <br>  I'll keep you up to date. </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>  I will include you in the loop. <br>  I will include you in the correspondence. </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>  Regarding your question about ... <br>  Regarding your question about ... </td></tr></tbody></table>  We ask for details: <br><table><tbody><tr><th>  Formally </th><th>  Neutral </th></tr><tr><td>  I would be grateful if you could ... <br>  I would appreciate it if you could ... </td><td>  For further details ... <br>  More detail / for more details ... </td></tr><tr><td>  Could you possibly explain ... <br>  Could you explain ... </td><td>  I do not fully understand what ... <br>  I did not fully understand that ... </td></tr><tr><td>  Could you please let me know ... <br>  Could you tell me ... </td><td>  I also wonder if ... <br>  I also wonder if ... </td></tr><tr><td>  Please could you send me ... <br>  Could you send me ... </td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>  How to report a problem </h3><br>  1. To enter a problem, the verb to flag is often used to mean ‚Äúindicate, underline‚Äù: <br>  <i>Flagging you about the issue on ...</i> ‚Üí Pointing you to a problem with ... <br>  <i>With this letter, I want to</i> point you to one problem with my letter ... <br><br>  2. To clarify or receive comments, use the phrases <i>on my / our / your end</i> or <i>from my / our / your side</i> - ‚Äúon my / our / your side‚Äù. <br><br>  3. Often, in the context of the discussion of problems, a noun <i>workaround</i> is used - a way out of the situation, a workaround. <br><br><h3>  How to put colleagues in a copy </h3><br>  <b>1.</b> To ask to put you in a copy, use the phrase <i>Cc me</i> , where <i>Cc</i> acts as a verb to ‚Äúcopy,‚Äù that is, put <i>Cc</i> in the line.  From the word <i>Cc is</i> formed the participle <i>cc'ed</i> - pay attention to the spelling.  The phrase <i>I was cc'ed</i> translates as "I was put in a copy." <br><br>  2. To tell the other party that you are adding someone to the discussion, write <i>Adding (name) to the thread</i> - add (name) to the conversation. <br><br>  3. Use the @ sign if the discussion is with several colleagues, but you need to contact one of them: <i>@ Steve, I‚Äôm right?</i>  - @ Steve, I think the next step is yours, right? <br><br><h3>  How to apologize </h3><table><tbody><tr><th>  Formally </th><th>  Neutral </th></tr><tr><td>  We regret to inform you that ... <br>  Unfortunately, we have to inform you about ... </td><td>  Unfortunately ... <br>  Unfortunately‚Ä¶ </td></tr><tr><td>  I am sorry to inform you that ... <br>  I find it hard to tell you, but ... </td><td>  I am afraid that ... <br>  I'm afraid that‚Ä¶ </td></tr><tr><td>  Please accept our apologies for ... <br>  Please accept our apologies for ... </td><td>  I would be glad / delighted to / happy to ... <br>  I would be happy / I would be happy ... </td></tr><tr><td>  I sincerely regret that ...

Messages contain a description of a unique problem or situation.  If you speak a language badly, how to be sure that the letter is composed correctly and kept in a business style? <br><br><h3>  Use dictionaries </h3><br>  Bilingual dictionaries will help if you do not know the translation of the word.  But they are of little use when it comes to style.  Use English explanatory dictionaries: they indicate the style (formal and informal) and describe the use of the word. <br><br>  Dictionaries of professional English language publishing houses are available online at <a href="https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/">https://en.oxforddictionaries.com</a> , <a href="http://dictionary.cambridge.org/">http://dictionary.cambridge.org</a> , <a href="http://www.ldoceonline.com/">http://www.ldoceonline.com</a> , <a href="http://www.macmillandictionary.com/">http://www.macmillandictionary.com</a> .  An abbreviated version is provided free of charge, you need to buy the full version, but for abbreviated business correspondence, it is quite enough. <br><br>  The structure of the dictionary entry: <br><br><ul><li>  Part of speech, </li><li>  transcription with the ability to listen to the pronunciation, </li><li>  definition </li><li>  examples of using, </li><li>  synonyms </li><li>  Frequently used phrases with words and phraseological units. </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3fe/1a5/cce/3fe1a5cce161106b8a3624829f7435b6.jpg"><br><br>  Pay attention to the <i>formal / neutral / informal</i> mark (formal, neutral, informal), use formal or neutral words.  If the selected word is marked as informal, study the section with synonyms. <br><br>  Do not ignore the examples, they help to correctly place the selected word or phrase in the sentence. <br><br><h3>  Use activator dictionaries </h3><br>  These dictionaries are not built on the principle of the alphabet of words, like traditional dictionaries, but on the principle of the alphabet of concepts.  For example, you want to convey the concept of "beautiful."  Find the concept of beautiful in the dictionary-activator.  Below it is a list of synonyms for the word beautiful with definitions, examples, and explanations of the difference between them.  In one place, all possible variants of expressing the idea ‚Äúbeautiful‚Äù are collected, and there is no need to search for each word separately. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/74e/4ac/abd/74e4acabdb31973a6386415d1111a02a.png"><br><br>  Today, the activator dictionary is released under the label Longman: Longman Language Activator. <br><br><h3>  Check word compatibility with Google search </h3><br>  If the words in a Russian phrase are combined, their joint translation into English is not always correct.  Hammer in English phrases in a search engine and check if words are found side by side. <br><br><h3>  Check text grammar </h3><br>  If you are not fluent in the language, use special services to check grammar and punctuation, for example, <a href="https://www.grammarly.com/">Grammarly</a> . <br><br><h2>  Conclusion </h2><br>  If you conduct electronic correspondence with foreign colleagues, partners and clients, but you do not speak English well, use the checklist: <br><br><ul><li>  Determine your audience.  Take into account its specifics when composing a message. </li><li>  Check if you can adapt an existing template for your purpose.  Perhaps you want to congratulate a colleague happy birthday?  Use a template. </li><li>  Make a plan for writing.  Rely on the standard structure of the email message.  Make sure you do not miss anything. </li><li>  Choose common phrases to use.  When choosing a style of phrases guided by the audience. </li><li>  Fill in the structure with your own words and sentences. </li><li>  Check the entire message for correct language through services, dictionaries and Google search.  Have you considered the style of the selected words?  Do they fit together? </li><li>  Make sure that you do not violate the principles of writing an e-mail.  Can it be cut without losing meaning?  Does it have jargon? </li><li>  Re-read the message.  Check that email etiquette is observed.  Clearly indicated the subject of the letter?  Are all typos fixed? </li><li>  Click Send! </li></ul><br><h2>  From the Editor </h2><br>  Courses "Netology" on the topic: <br><br><ul><li>  Full-time program ‚Äú <a href="https://netology.ru/programs/product-lead%3Futm_source%3Dblog%26utm_medium%3D747%26utm_campaign%3Dhabr">Manager of a digital product</a> ‚Äù: 5 months of study, 20 well-known experts of the Runet, 100+ hours of practice; </li><li>  full-time program " <a href="http://netolo.gy/dZn">Director of online marketing</a> "; </li><li>  full-time program " <a href="http://netolo.gy/dZo">Content Producer</a> "; </li><li>  online program " <a href="https://netology.ru/programs/pm%3Futm_source%3Dblog%26utm_medium%3D747%26utm_campaign%3Dhabr">Profession product manager</a> "; </li><li>  online program " <a href="https://netology.ru/programs/product-design%3Futm_source%3Dblog%26utm_medium%3D747%26utm_campaign%3Dhabr">Profession product designer</a> ." </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/340358/">https://habr.com/ru/post/340358/</a></p>
