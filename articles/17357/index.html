A team of programmers and philologists has compiled a program that from the plot collisions of ‚ÄúAnna Karenina‚Äù and the texts of 13 authors made the novel ‚ÄúTrue Love‚Äù.  However, writers and IT-specialists suggest that this is a "fake", reports RIA "New Region". <br><br>  The plot of the first "computer" novel with the conditional name [True Love] * .wrt was a love collision of the title characters of Anna Karenina.  The action takes place on an unknown island in times very similar to our days.  The book is designed in the manner of Haruki Murakami, the style is based on vocabulary, language means and techniques of 13 domestic and foreign authors of the XIX-XXI centuries. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  To create the text of the novel, the team of developers and philologists created the PC Writer 2008 program, which took 8 months to write.  Philologists collected a dossier for each hero of the novel, which included a description of appearance, vocabulary, psychological portrait and other characteristics.  A description of the initial situation was also created, on the basis of which the program generated the text of the novel, which took three days of uninterrupted computer operation.

      As stated in the publishing house Astrel-SPb, the novel will be published in a circulation of 10 thousand copies - as a potential best-seller medium.  According to publishers, the cost of creating the novel, including the fee to the developers of the program, turned out to be 10 times less than the fee for a popular Russian author.  Professional writers believe that the novel was created by quite a living writer, having more than a dozen works in an asset, published under an assumed name.  IT-specialists were in solidarity with the writers and stated that the achievements in the field of artificial intelligence did not reach the level necessary for writing the novel, and even the promising developments that exist today do not allow writing software that would itself generate a literary text with any complex plot line. <br><br>  We will note that attempts to create an ‚Äúartificial writer‚Äù have been undertaken for a long time.  The most successful were the experiments that had nothing to do with commercial literary activity: the projects of the Russian media artist Sergey Teterin ‚ÄúThe Mobile Avatar of Andy Warhol‚Äù and ‚ÄúCyber-Pushkin‚Äù.  "Warhol-Bot" was a program that allows using SMS to "communicate" with Andy Warhol.  Warhol even gave coherent and quite logical answers. <br><br>  The machine named " <a href="http://www.teterin.ru/pushkin/">Cyber ‚Äã‚ÄãPushkin</a> " is the RS, on which, according to the author, "only primitive programs are being used to generate Russian-language poems."  True, Sergei Teterin's Cyber ‚Äã‚ÄãPushkin was exhibited in April 2006 at the St. Petersburg Hermitage Museum, in November 2003 was presented at the Museumsquartier (Vienna, Austria) as part of the Roboexotica festival, and in 2002 performed in the Tretyakov Gallery and the Moscow Cinema Museum. <br><br>  Yandex also provided its users with a <a href="http://referats.yandex.ru/pushkin/">Poet Generator.</a>  <a href="http://referats.yandex.ru/pushkin/">A.S. Pushkin</a> . <br><br>  Experts predict circulation crushing failure. <br><br>  via <a href="http://www.newsru.com/">newsru.com</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/17357/">https://habr.com/ru/post/17357/</a></p>
