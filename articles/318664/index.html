  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Rent dedicated servers in Russia</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hi, habrovchane!  Honestly, we did not think that after the first post our small stock of dedicated servers would be disassembled in just a matter of hours.  Thank you for your trust!  We hope that you will be pleased with the quality of the channel and iron.  Now we have prepared a new equipment, and to it a New Year's gift - 1 Gbps for free. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b6b/94b/5fa/b6b94b5fa16e4019a6e5a7ca12d4afc0.jpg"></div><br><h3>  Position in the data center market </h3><br>  Now a lot of hosting companies provide dedicated servers for rent.  Some people have steep parameters, and the price is too high, while others - on the contrary, it is cheap, but the filling is not enough for what.  To find the perfect server for the task, you need to spend more than one hour of time on websites with advertising information in order to understand what needs to be taken and where.  At the same time, few people write about the selection criteria - basically the reasons why it is necessary to choose this particular service provider. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  We have become accustomed to the fact that we often have to give projects to outsourcing, because abroad we will do better, whatever it is.  Especially, for example, in Germany.  But there are minus - servers that are far away - they are far away and nothing can be done with it.  If you rent local Russian servers, for example, in Kontel, you can come to the territory of the data center and work directly with a physical server.  What is in Germany cannot be touched, but in Russia you can come to your provider‚Äôs office and ask for a tour of the data center.  If the company has a high priority in customer relations, they will not refuse you. <br><br><h3>  How to choose </h3><br>  The first thing you need to pay attention to is the number of visitors that is planned on the resource.  The reality is that different engines and sites can have the same hosting resources and withstand different numbers of users.  The average value for a typical corporate dedicated server in Russia is from 2,000 to 300,000 people.  Without deep performance optimization.  For more attendance, be prepared to install several dedicated servers.

    <ul><li>  It is also important to use all the services included in the contract: the more 'bonuses', the higher the price.  However, not all of the proposed may be needed in reality. </li><li>  Check if the server capacity can be scaled in the future.  It may be more convenient to purchase a new configuration. </li><li>  The platform is important.  Desktop components are less reliable, but cost less.  In addition, Western companies often limit the choice of operating systems for the client server. </li></ul><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d40/4c6/397/d404c639761c47428f91e9cc052cdad3.jpg"></div><br>  If we compare server rental services with Western companies and Russian companies, then this is what can be called among the first important factors: <br><br><ul><li>  The disadvantage of renting dedicated servers abroad is that it is not possible to use fiscal accounting.  When entering into an agreement between a Russian and a foreign company, you can submit bureaucratic delays yourself. </li></ul><br><ul><li>  Another advantage of a <a href="http://cloud4box.com/service/servers/">dedicated server</a> in Russia is a relatively short response time compared to foreign ones.  They respond, simply put, our faster. </li></ul><br><h3>  The importance of fast ping in the rental of dedicated servers </h3><br>  Page response speed is one of the main criteria for any user.  If she is not satisfied with the client of the online store or the online ‚Äúplayer in tanchiki‚Äù, then the number of clients will be much less.  So, if the users of your service are in Russia, then a dedicated server in Moscow will provide a shorter ping than any other server that is located west of Moscow. <br><br><ul><li>  Our <a href="http://cloud4box.com/service/servers/">dedicated servers</a> are assembled from new components.  Breakdowns are extremely rare.  In this case, failed disks, for example, are replaced within half an hour.  In Western companies, the equipment may be old, and some may provide virtual servers under the guise of dedicated and take inadequate payment, respectively. <br><br></li><li>  Technical support specialists speak your native language - Russian.  This facilitates mutual understanding in working issues.  If you wish, you can come to the data center and independently work with your server. </li></ul><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bdd/591/a33/bdd591a336bc4553b4a60217c747c110.jpg"></div><br><ul><li>  There are no hidden or installment payments in Contel.  Forming value is a transparent process.  Additional services are included in the package and a lump sum will be paid for them.  Sometimes in the process of renting servers from Western companies, a situation occurs that is similar to servicing cards in a not very customer-oriented bank: when exorbitant fees are charged for connecting minimally important services. </li></ul><br><ul><li>  It so happens that for any complaint such as abuse, you will no longer provide services.  We give time to eliminate and are always open for negotiations. </li></ul><br><h3>  Our specialist answers </h3><br><h4>  How often do problems arise with the hardware in the company?  How quickly solved? <br></h4><br><blockquote>  There are force majeurs, but in terms of equipment failure, this year I only had one memory.  We deal with the solution as they are received, if the problem is massive - for example, the failure of network equipment and the elimination of malfunctions are accordingly carried out as soon as possible. </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2e2/d25/400/2e2d25400cf2474eb8624de28cf696d6.jpg"><br><br><h4>  What happens if the payment is not received on time? </h4><br><blockquote>  For each service different terms of renewal.  For a <a href="http://cloud4box.com/service/vps/">VPS server,</a> payment must arrive no later than 3 days after the end of the paid period.  Dedicated servers: up to 7 days from the end of the paid period (unless otherwise specified).  After the paid period, and the delay of payment for 3-7 days, the service is deleted without the possibility of recovery. <br></blockquote><br><h4>  Is there server cloning or backup? </h4><br><blockquote>  For VPS servers, backup is not performed in order to reduce the cost of the service.  But for the <a href="http://cloud4box.com/service/vps/">Administered VPS</a> services, on the higher tariff plans we offer a free IPSmanager control panel, with the ability to set up backup to third-party FTP, such as Yandex.Disk, DropBox.  This allows backing up not only files of sites, databases, and other things, but also settings for all control panel parameters, EMAIL settings (SPF, DKIM, etc.), settings for sites, and domains, users, etc.  For the Dedicated Servers service, we offer free storage at 100GB with FTP / sFTP access and expandability. <br></blockquote><br><h4>  Is there a local network between vpc and dedicated servers? <br></h4><br><blockquote>  The ability to create a local network between servers is, but only for dedicated servers. </blockquote><br>
<h4>  How does the customer support system work with dedicated servers?  What are the features? </h4><br><blockquote>  Support is provided, both by phone and by system ticket - billing panel.  In case of emergency communication, support can be provided directly through the data center employees, by phone number. </blockquote><br><h4>  How is data recycled after a client abandons the server? </h4><br><blockquote>  For a <a href="http://cloud4box.com/service/vps/">VPS server</a> , a complete removal of the virtual disk (without the possibility of recovery) is performed  For a dedicated server immediately after the end of the paid period, and late payment for more than 7 days, formatting disks, and installing a clean OS. </blockquote><br><h4>  What about data security on servers? </h4><br><blockquote>  We are constantly working on it.  In the near future - to install webcams with the ability to view video in real time for each client through a personal account. </blockquote><br><h3>  With us - calm </h3><br>  Dedicated servers of the Contel company are located in its own data center, which stands a kilometer from the main traffic exchange point in Russia.  So we guarantee the stability of communication, the constancy of electrical power and redundancy of communication lines.  Before issuing the server to the client, we make it checked by the forces and our specialists, and after that you can test the server yourself on our territory. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aaf/25a/1a2/aaf25a1a2a9946f8914df3b031e55fea.jpg"><br><br>  Monitoring of the dedicated servers does not stop for a minute.  It is also necessary for quick resolution of emerging issues and problems.  Access to the Internet is made through its own communication channels and the lines of any third-party operators that are present on the MMTS-9.  The total capacity of the lines of each dedicated server is 1 Gbit / s, for particularly demanding projects we can provide dedicated honest provider gigabits without any traffic restrictions. <br><br>  Perhaps this is old-fashioned - to trust that you can ‚Äútouch‚Äù and see with your own eyes, but you can be absolutely sure.  It is important to at least be able to come, you can not use it, but still.  So calmer and more familiar, isn't it? <br><br>  We can invite everyone to our data center for a tour. The only thing you need to do is arrange your visit in advance.  If suddenly after the <a href="http://cloud4box.com/service/servers/">order</a> you are not satisfied with the quality, then within 2 weeks we guarantee an instant refund of money without any conditions. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/318664/">https://habr.com/ru/post/318664/</a></p>
