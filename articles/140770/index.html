In one profile, there is nothing but short messages, as its owner went to the toilet and returned happy.  In another, the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/123675/">president of the United States communicates with the Americans</a> . <br><br>  And one simple eighteen-year-old schoolboy, Mike Stone, used Twitter to invite a porn star to her prom! <a name="habracut"></a>

      At the time of my prom - Twitter was not.  And I went to the library three kilometers up the hill ... But Mike just took and sent an invitation to all the porn stars found on Twitter.  Someone yes agree. <br><br>  And, you know, as it turned out, some porn stars started their careers early and plunged into work.  So much so that as a result we missed our own graduation party. <br><br>  Mike just gave them a second chance.  A porn star Megan Piper, just turned out to be so.  So, that immediately agreed and began to look for where to buy a dress: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/713/a7f/017/713a7f017d1705db65b1bc575fa7641a.png"><br><br>  But it was not there!  The press found out about all this and the news was spread throughout the American media.  And everything is good, only Mike's mom somehow did not want to support this idea.  Yes, and the teachers promised that they would not be allowed into the school. <br><br>  But Mike has already said that he will pay for a ticket for Megan from California!  What to do? <br>  And then Twitter comes to the rescue again.  The hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/"># porn4prom</a> united everyone to help Mike and Megan‚Äôs happiness!  Among them, I saw several people posing as Anonymous.  And if they help, then everything will work out for Mike! <br><br>  So, Mike, good luck to you!  Throw a coin for us! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2b1/087/33f/2b108733f4da9814469207bcde0dcbcd.png"><br><br><h4>  Why all this on Habr√©? </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/39d/651/ce0/39d651ce0cef7852e64c801ac4f120bc.jpg"><br><br>  Some of you, after reading this news, immediately smiles and puts a plus.  But such, of course, not so much.  Habr is still a very serious resource and, by the way, a cake.  Therefore, it is wrong for me to leave the news without comment, so as not to lose karma at all. <br><br>  In fact, from my point of view, this news is something that many startups need to learn.  No, do not invite porn stars to parties (though why not?).  And the ability to promote yourself and your project with minimal effort. <br><br>  I have met many times with creative advertisers who promised to conduct a mass PR campaign to promote the Internet project.  And they were all very similar.  We take a million and hang a billboard.  And then we create a VKontakte group and, of course, a Facebook page. <br><br>  What is a million?  What is a billboard for an online project?  Even Yandex began to hang them out 7 years after the start and the exit to profit under $ 70 million a year. <br><br>  Facebook Page?  Vkontakte community?  What are you speaking about?  This is not enough.  There just no one will go.  You just need to be truly creative.  Find the very idea that will be interesting.  Which will attract journalists, and then the Internet users.  About which all mainstream media will be reported for free and all non-essential ones will be reprinted.  You will save a lot of money on promotion and be able to invest it in development.  Be creative!  Watch the implementation of other people's ideas.  Even those who help sell films for adults, creating for the porn actress the image of an ordinary ‚Äúgood‚Äù girl who has never been to a graduation. <br><br>  PS If someone decided to go VKontakte and invite Ksenia Sobchak to ride a sled - do not do it.  This is my idea! <br><br>  PPS Based on <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-17852_3-57403909-71/how-600-tweets-can-get-you-a-porn-star-prom-date/">cnet</a> and others. <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> Well, of course, just send invitations to porn stars or Ksenia Sobchak a little!  Millions of messages a day appear on Twitter and social networks!  Therefore it is necessary to do even more important work.  To interest journalists in this.  Many people think that money plays a key role in all this.  Sometimes yes.  Need to pay for one loud article.  But, this is not a dogma.  Understand that journalists are also interested in interesting news from the point of view of the public.  But about this people will read!  This is what will increase the rating of the publication.  Use feedback from editors, writers, journalists.  Send press releases about your event!  Interest them!  Look at how many boring things they write: a new version has been released ... a startup has received X money ... etc.  Give them interesting news and they will take it! <br><br>  <b>UPD2</b> <i>Shkolota sent spam on tweeter, the blonde answered, and mother is against, and do you call this creative?</i> <br><br>  Yes.  This brought the result.  And do not indulge yourself with the illusion that all this is from the beginning to the end of the ‚Äúshkolota‚Äù  This is a well-thought PR action.  Like most Hollywood movies, where it‚Äôs quite clearly calculated at what second you should cry, and at what laugh.  This is a competent PR-action.  Unfortunately, many start-ups in Habr√© have no idea what to do next after posting a blog post ‚ÄúI-Pierre‚Äù.  They have a false feeling that now it all goes and turns itself.  People will come and everything will be fine.  It does not happen.  Need to deal with PR th.  Without spending millions on billboards and banners.  It is necessary, as I said, to be creative.  Not enough to do something good.  You need to be able to bring it to people. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/140770/">https://habr.com/ru/post/140770/</a></p>
