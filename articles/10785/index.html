I cannot live my money until the end of my days, and, given the modesty of my needs, I cannot even live in many lives. <br><br>  I am no longer interested in making money.  Being a Jew, I, with the exception of the latter, lived and worked in Russia, I learned the country and its people well, I studied the strength and weakness of the Russians.  Starting out as a merciless exploiter and a Jew, I gradually became sympathetic to the great and super-tolerant Russian people, and now I sincerely wish him well.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  I changed religion, was baptized into Orthodoxy, in many respects I broke up with the Jewish community and its joint opinion, although I did not stop being a Jew to the end. <br><br>  My money, torn first from Russia, is now working for the good of Russia, and my life experience could also serve as a Russian.  I hope that by publishing this brochure with a free right to reprint (at first, an intra-corporate confidential) brochure, I will benefit the people who are desperate and stuck in insoluble problems. <br><br>  In fact, there is not everyone in the world according to the Sun, but money in the world can be enough for everyone.  In order for them to be needed, first of all, the desire and ability to accept them, and good luck, good luck, once again good luck. <br><br>  Ask any Russian: what is luck?  He will answer - luck, not depending on us.  Jews brought up differently.  From a young age you are taught that luck is a product of purposeful action, that seemingly random events are actually prepared by people, their faith and will. <br><br>  The world is not the element of chaos, and luck is not so blind as many imagine it.  People on earth receive different amounts of money, because they perceive reality differently, they perceive the world differently.  In order to make you richer, changes are needed not from the outside, but inside you.  This, if you will, is the magic of success. <br><br>  Our primitive ancestor, before going hunting, painted a deer on sand and hit an imaginary beast with a spear.  Why did he do it?  Just because of his darkness - or he knew from the experience of millennia that a plan, an ideological development of a future event, precedes every material action. <br><br>  This magic was not primitive, it really helped the hunter to get this deer.  Such is the power of faith — the power to materialize our desires and ideas.  Or vice versa - to materialize our fears and phobias. <br><br>  When in the beginning of the 90s I, a modest scientist, started a business, I very strictly followed one condition of Western social psychology: “To drive into the neck of even the most intelligent employee if he decomposes with pessimism and disbelief in the success of the team.”  Then I just followed the Western fashion, and did not understand why I was doing this? <br><br>  Now I know exactly what the point is.  If in that ancient tribe there were a very sensible hunter who would have doubted the sand figure, then the tribe would not have gotten a real deer and would have died of starvation.  One cannot joke with faith: the placebo (that is, the external material attributes of the faith) can be anything, even sand, even silk banners, even on the tree of icons - but faith itself moves things, and moves just as much as it is strong. <br><br>  If you do not believe in the success of an enterprise, it is better not to start it at all!  - Everywhere advise novice entrepreneurs.  You probably think this is a metaphor?  That success of a business only indirectly depends on faith in it?  No, it is the most direct way. <br><br>  Russian popular sayings and signs, milestones of popular observation <br>  It was not for nothing that I decided to confirm my thought with the help of everyone from my childhood familiar folk observations about happiness and unhappiness, about luck and failure.  For centuries, people have observed the dynamics of the enrichment process, and, not always understanding the underlying causes, still quite accurately characterized the visible side. <br><br>  “Only a treasure is given to fools,” wrote the poet Yershov in the text.  This amazing observation seems at first glance completely illogical, ridiculous, but it is true.  Why is the treasure and, taking wider, the wealth given to "fools"?  There is their definition of the gospel - “the poor in spirit” - less rude, but the essence is the same. <br><br>  A fool has one curious property - when starting a business, he does not think about all the upcoming difficulties, obstacles and obstacles that the “intelligent” will set in advance on his mental path.  By virtue of this, the folk “fool” complex is simple.  But, it would seem, this is his personal affair: if you don’t see the wall, it doesn’t mean that you don’t crack your forehead!  However - what a miracle!  - “Fool”, not seeing the wall, passes through it, without even noticing, and not only in the fairy tale - very often in life.  Success is obtained from him by himself - apparently, and the wall, clearly visible by the “smart” was in fact imaginary, self-created in the mind, illusory. <br><br>  This property - the loss of luck, especially commercial, spiritually stupid natures - not an accident and not “judgment of heaven”.  The world depends on our ideas about it.  and the more spiritually refined nature sees for itself in the world of obstacles, the more they (by her own order!) arise.  For example, if you put a problem before a refined intellectual: “start trading” - he will come up with thousands of reasons for failure beforehand: collusion in the market, the power of wholesale suppliers, racketeering, unstable greedy power, and many other factors.  But we often see how the neighbor of this intellectual, who studied at a school for underdeveloped children (even it happens!), Suddenly opens up a trade and leads it successfully, because, because of its dullness and underdevelopment of the imagination, it does not think about the upcoming difficulties. <br><br>  We gloatingly look at the “fool”: they say, he does not see a trap, now he will please him!  He passes - and the trap is not in place.  We follow - and get into the “long-awaited” cancan.  What is the matter?  We just live in different worlds.  But more about that later. <br><br>  “The trouble does not go alone” - says our proverb.  Why so?  By simple probability, misfortune and joy, good luck and bad luck should seem to be distributed approximately equally, at least chaotically.  But the people have long noticed that fate strikes heaps.  For some reason, one misfortune attracts, magnetizes another, the more troubles - the more they are added, as if they tend to swarm along the bee.  What is the reason?  After all, luck and failure are the lot, not subject to us, our mind and our will.  How can we calculate success or failure in advance?  How can we increase or decrease it?  Is cheating in casino good luck?  About this below, but for now let's remember it firmly: a person subjected to a blow by failure, somehow loses “immunity”, and one failure opens the way for another, outwardly with her, seemingly unconnected. <br><br>  "The lousy goat spoils the whole Ovchara."  The direct essence of the saying is clear - a sick animal strikes a healthy one.  But this is not about animals and not about the epidemic.  The symbolic plan of a saying is different - one member of a collective, obsessed with some kind of spiritual leprosy, can ruin the whole collective, corrupt and corrupt.  And why, for example, not the other way around?  It would seem that the team has much more opportunities to remake the “goat” in itself.  What is the “goat” interest to fight with everyone around you?  Yes, often he does not set a goal to remake someone - all by itself turns out.  The social reality in the team changes - from successful it becomes a bunch of losers, from exemplary - a crowd of crooks or whiners.  Why?  As far as the factor of “faith” and “will” is evident here, we are on the verge of solving the great mystery of the relationship between material reality and man’s faith and will ... <br><br>  “Born in a shirt” is about a lucky man.  As the saying goes, “trouble does not go alone,” and here it is emphasized: as luck is obtained, the likelihood of a new receipt increases.  The more victories - the greater the chance of a new victory.  The more obvious the success, the greater the chances for its repetition.  Why?  What a strange relationship?  It seems like a person must be convinced that he is successful - and after that he magically becomes successful ?! <br><br>  “Money goes to money” is another confirmation of what has been said.  Why are the rich getting richer and the poor poorer?  Does the “conspiracy” factor play a role here?  If so, then who prevents the poor from making the same “conspiracy”?  Questions, questions, and no answer yet ... <br><br>  “Never speak for people“ no ”until they themselves told him to you” is a wise and very practical saying.  Often a person is so visible, imagines the alleged refusal of his request, so clearly and in the roles he plays in the imagination and the scene of his failure, that you don’t need to find out anything: he asked himself and answered, the request died in himself - what more ? <br><br>  But quite often we encountered situations where such a person still overcame himself and decided to go and find out the real result. <br><br>  He is not surprised at all when the result exactly corresponds to his developed imagination.  It would seem that he just correctly calculated the world - but someone else suddenly achieves completely different results with the same starting indicator as our skeptic.  Why? <br><br>  Metaphysics of the Universe <br>  When an Orthodox Russian reads in the Gospel a clear “instruction for using the Universe” - “ask - and it will be given to you”, “If you have faith with mustard seed — and you can move mountains, order a tree with roots to throw itself into the ocean,” then it is peculiarities of upbringing understands this as an allegory divorced from life. <br><br>  A Jew knows better than a Russian that this text needs to be understood literally, that we have an effective system for arranging life.  Jesus Christ perfectly knew the answer to your, reader, question - how to earn big money?  Among the Hindus, we find the idea of ​​“maya” - the universal illusion surrounding the human being, a certain kingdom of mirages concealing the truth of the Brahman.  Is material nature an illusion?  Is the stable, familiar world around us a simple mirage?  And the laws of things that we used to obey - invented by ourselves? <br><br>  For myself, I have long ago decided this question positively.  A scientist with a degree and an entrepreneur with millions, I know well: if tomorrow humanity believes that the earth - I apologize for the expression, the parallelepiped, then angular images of our planet will be brought from space. <br><br>  Already from the school bench, we know that there is no matter, that in appearance the whole object consists of particles distant from each other in cosmic proportions.  And inside the particles there is also an emptiness (the electron of the “indivisible” atom is separated from the nucleus in the same way as the pinhead on the last bench of the Luzhniki stadium from the tennis ball in the middle of this stadium). <br><br>  But the nucleus of the atom is just as empty - there are elements of it.  While science got to the "quarks".  The time will come, they will prove their emptiness.  So there is no matter.  But maybe energy exists? <br><br>  The calculations of modern physicists show that the sum of all positively and negatively directed energies in the Universe should be equal to the bullet.  Yes, we ourselves know that action is equal to counteraction - isn’t it a reason to think about the reality of energy? <br><br>  If there is neither matter nor energy, then maybe there is empty space?  Modern science turns space into a mathematical point without volume.  In the conditions of infinity, mathematically equal segments can be set aside in all directions at any point of the universe.  But this is a ball formula!  And, it turns out, we are all the time in the center of the same ball, no matter how much we move ... <br><br>  Infinity is not something very huge, as it seems to everyday consciousness.  Huge still has the material parameters, and their infinity is deprived.  Mathematically, it is much closer and topological to zero than to the immense, embarrassing imagination. <br><br>  The gigantism of the universe and the abandonment in it of a grain of sand - of a person - is a schizophrenic illusion of the 20th century.  It reflects not the true state of things, but only the painful decadence of the spirit of its creators.  But if you stand on the point of discussion of the Hindus with their maya, the illusiveness of the material, then what really is?  It seems to me (and this confirms my commercial experience) that in fact there is a dynamic system of interconnection between the individual and the Universe, which is very flexible and calculated under the mental maturity of the individual. <br><br>  I imagine the universe as a device for illustrating our ideas about it.  We enter Maya for a while and exist here in the world that we consider necessary to create for ourselves.  It would seem - a fairy tale, the kingdom of dreams! <br><br>  But the danger lies in the fact that the stalemate can simulate both evil and hell on earth.  It’s in vain to blame the Universe for this - it only fulfilled our application.  You have to blame yourself - therefore, the great teachers of humanity insisted on the personal transformation of man, realizing that with the old views on the universe it is useless to build a new world. <br><br>  We live in a world of faith and will - and nothing more.  Everything else has a “placebo” character.  What is a placebo?  Doctors call a dummy, which is given to a patient under the guise of medicine.  Believing that this is a medicine, many suggested patients get better, “So, stocks, banknotes, diplomas and everything else - your placebo, our hold on your own faith.  Take a closer look at them - what would these colored papers become without collective faith and them, without collective deification of them?  Only your ardent faith in their value makes them truly valuable.  Plus - makes them difficult to reach for you.  If you are internally inclined to the fact that it is intrinsically inclined to get money, that it is difficult to get money, then it is difficult for us to get it.  The facts confirming your “rightness”, the obedient Universe will gladly provide you - it works, but for your applications.  The more of these facts, the more convincing your poverty will be for you, the more you will link it.  The moment will come when the amount of your faith in your own failure will become equal to the “mustard seed” - then woe to you, you are already incurable, you have created a stable world around you, which is almost impossible to shake. <br><br>  Faith is a dangerous, two-way factor.  She can help us grow - and she can bend you to nothingness.  It enriches us - and it plunges into the quagmire of hopeless poverty. <br><br>  First of all, we receive our world from our parents - this is what Hindus call “karma”.  Since the spirit that has entered the dense layers of maya does not yet have its own ideas about life, the world for it is built up by its mentors.  What the world was for parents - holiday or hard labor - so it will be for the child.  Then, mother, it is very difficult for us to change our “karma”.  We were convinced - and proved by facts, examples - that it is very difficult to get a thousand.  And we do not understand - how can it be easy for someone, to get a million?  After all, it’s still obvious ... <br><br>  In critical times it becomes especially clear how much our ideas about life mean.  In post-reform Russia of the 1990s, one part of the population considered capitalism to be paradise — now it lives in paradise, at least in material paradise.  The other part believed that capitalism was hell, they were brought up like this, and they ended up in hell as soon as the key word, placebo capitalism, sounded. <br><br>  In fact, any “isms” are empty; your ideas about the Universe fill them with content.  The people of Marx and the People of Smith are equally right - they just live in different worlds, in different universes. <br><br>  The universe consists of different layers and layers of ideas: <br><br>  Our personal presentation. <br>  Collective and group views. <br>  Historical views of a number of generations. <br>  Absolute laws of nature that have never changed in the memory of mankind. <br>  Accordingly, there are also modes of “sentences” in reality around us.  We ourselves do not know exactly where it came from, but we firmly believe that IT is “Impossible”, the other is “unlikely”, the third is “very likely”, and the fourth is “inevitable." <br><br>  However, the will of a person, if it is trained, how athletes train muscles, is able to withstand even the fourth group of ideas - “absolute laws” with the modus-sentence “impossible”.  During my business trips to Southeast Asia and Hindustan, I myself met and talked with yogis, magicians, monks who overcame gravity, levitated, teleported objects.  This is the height of the will, its monstrous power, comparable to that reflected in the words of Christ about the “mustard seed of faith.”  Few can overcome Maya at its very foundation, raise its mass at the very foundation. <br><br>  We know that these were the disciples of Christ.  Moreover, the case is described very vividly - when a disciple, contrary to the law of nature, went to Christ by water, but then he doubted the possibility of such a miracle and immediately began to fall, to sink.  There are quite historical testimonies about the Russian saint Seraphim of Sarov, who “hovered above the ground,” that is, he levitated in defiance of gravity. <br><br>  I admit honestly, I did not achieve such heights of “volpinism” (I produce this sport from two words - “will” and “mountaineering”), and it is unlikely that I will achieve it.  But I know that if a world record of volpinism is possible, then its regional championships and courtyards are possible.  If you set the task of getting rich, then you do not need to overstrain the overcoming of the laws of nature.  It is much easier for you, because money does not fall into the category of “obligatory” but into the category of “probable”. <br><br>  Few of you, the reader, have seen, like me, levitating magicians.           —  ,      . <br><br>   ,         ,    .     “ ”,         . <br><br>        “   ”    ,       “”. <br><br>      ,   ,    .    “”    . , ,    “”,  “ ”,       . “     !” —      .   , ,   (, ,   ),   (,  ). , , ,     .      ,    .    ,   : “    ”. <br><br>        .    , “”,   ,  ,     .       .             ,   ?          ? <br><br>     ,    ,   ,   ( )      .

Communism did not give wealth, and the market will not give it either - it's all nothing more than a placebo for the consumer spirit. Availability of money is generally a non-market concept, because the market is aimed at maximizing money saving. If you have soap, and I have an awl, then we could buy them from each other. But, apart from mutual desire, it is necessary that everyone except for sewing and soap should also have a coin. Or barter - without money - but in macroeconomics it is very difficult to implement. It turns out the magic circle - to start production, you need money, and to become a consumer, you need money. That is, we have not yet begun to produce or consume, and the money is already needed. Who will give them - if not production and not consumption?</font></font><br><br>  Universe.   . ,  —   —   ,      ,       . <br><br>      <br>           ,   .    ,     ,  ,      .  ,     , , ,    —   :  ,     .     , ,      —             - . <br><br>     ,         . ,  —       (),       .    —     ,    ,     ,     .    “” — .     ,   . <br><br>        .     “”     ,  “”      .      — “   ”  “    ”.   ,          ,        “ ” —    . <br><br>        “     ”,       ,        ,    .     “ ”,   “ ”,       ,      . <br><br>      .  “ ”  , “,   ”      .  “”,      ,     </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/10785/">https://habr.com/ru/post/10785/</a></p>
