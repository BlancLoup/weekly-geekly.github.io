Search engine policy <br>  2. Significance of email for search engines <br>  3. The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãmonetization <br>  4. Conclusion <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  <font color="grey">Search engine policy</font> </h1><br>  Search engines are the largest online resources, whose task is to gather around them the maximum number of users and earn money from it (from advertising).  The largest search engines known in Russia: Yandex, Google, Rambler, Yahoo. <br><br>  How often in recent times such giants as Yandex or Google delight us with new services?  Amazing, really!  Let's recall some of the successful projects: <br>  - Yandex.  Traffic jams; <br>  - google.  Travel by public transport; <br>  - Yandex.  Photos; <br>  - google.  Picassa; <br>  - Yandex.  People drive; <br>  - google.  Documents; <br>  - ... <br><br>  And all these services are free!  Why do you ask?  Obviously, the more free services the Intrnet Resource provides, the more users will ‚Äúdwell‚Äù on it, which means that they will use search more often, which means they will more often click on banner ads in search results, and as a result the search engine will be enriched.

      That is why today Yandex and Google are striving not only to create new free services, but also quite often buy them.  You can recall the purchase of YouTube for 1.65 billion dollars or the recent purchase of Yandex - Smilink for 10 million dollars. <br><br><h1>  <font color="grey">Significance of email for search engines</font> </h1><br>  Today, for example, Yandex possesses analogs of about 70% of Google services, moreover, some of them are better.  But why do many still choose Google, and not Yandex? <br><br>  Moreover, many do not even know or simply do not use Yandex services, because  their homepage is Mail.ru or Rambler.ru, where you are offered to download ICQ, watch a horoscope or flirt on Dating. <br><br>  Everything is very simple.  My opinion is that the <strong>user in 90% of cases will choose the resource on which he has an active email account.</strong>  And this is extremely important.  No matter how many services Yandex has created, it will not be able to entice Mail.ru‚Äôs audience to itself until it starts a Yandex box and, equally important, it will be actively used. <br><br>  And it is not surprising that even with the obvious advantages of some Yandex services over Googlovsky (Photos, Maps, Search), I preferred Google.  I have gmail mail and <strong>it integrates (integrates)</strong> all my services into a single information space. <br><br>  From here the conclusion is inapplicable: the task of Yandex is to force users to transfer to its mail. <br><br>  It is clear that competing with Google for Yandex is a difficult task, but it is possible, though not easy, to lure away the users of Mail.ru and Rambler.ru email accounts. <br><br>  In the next chapter I will share with you the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow Yandex can get new active users of its email service, and as a result active users of all its services, including search. <br><br>  Why Yandex?  I just like it most of all among Russian search engines and I wish him success in the fight against Mail.ru and Rambler.ru not to mention Google (which I use in 90% of cases). <br><br><h1>  <font color="grey">Idea Ammonization</font> <font color="grey"><br></font> </h1><br>  The word monetization within the Internet community is most often found when they talk about the monetization of any free service.  For example, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/social_networks/40038.html">social networks</a> : <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/startup/48041.html">Odnoklassniko</a> 's <a href="http://rold.habrahabr.ru/blog/36627.html">monetization</a> or <a href="http://rold.habrahabr.ru/blog/36627.html">Vkontakte monetization</a> . <br><br>  I propose to introduce a <a href="http://www.google.ru/search%3Fcomplete%3D1%26amp%3Bhl%3Dru%26amp%3Bnewwindow%3D1%26amp%3Bclient%3Dfirefox%26amp%3Brls%3Dru.yandex%253Aru%253Aofficial%26amp%3Bhs%3Dni5%26amp%3Bq%3D%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F%26amp%3BbtnG%3D%25D0%259F%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%26amp%3Blr%3D%26amp%3Baq%3Df">new term</a> : Amonetisation. <br><br>  Ammonization is a process when a company, by providing a free service, pays the user for using it. <br><br>  Sounds crazy?  But let's look at the advantages of monetization.  As we already understood, every search engine should dream of getting active email accounts, i.e.  users who will be in 90% of cases to choose their services.  Let's consider as an experimental - Yandex. <br><br>  <strong>So, the task:</strong> <br>  It is given - on Mail.ru and Rambler.ru services there are a lot of users who use them ‚Äúout of habit‚Äù, not wanting to know that there is an excellent mail on Yandex. <br>  The task is to lure as many users as possible to Yandex mail. <br><br>  <strong>Decision:</strong> <br>  Yandex introduces a new rule - we will list active users of mail on Yandex from 5 to 15 rubles a month to Yandex. Money! <br><br>  The degree of your activity will be evaluated by the following parameters: <br><ol><li>  Number of incoming emails per month </li><li>  Number of sent letters per month </li><li>  Number of open (read) letters per month </li><li>  Register emails in social networks (i.e., social networks will be sent to this email), the more social networks - the greater the degree of activity </li><li>  Your activity in other services Yandex - Maps, Tape, Photos, Search, etc. </li><li>  Do not use forwarding filters to other addresses or ‚Äúpick up‚Äù mail from other accounts </li><li>  Using the WEB interface </li></ol><br>  Thus, we get really active users. <br><br>  A side positive effect is the development of Yandex.Money, because  people have little money in their purses and a natural desire to spend them, and for this they will have to either save a couple of years or <strong>replenish their wallet</strong> . <br><br>  How much will such a pleasure for Yandex cost? <br><br>  Today, Yandex has about 10M mail users, I think that only 1M is really active users who can receive from 5 rubles.  Suppose that in the course of such a campaign we will get a doubling of the audience - i.e.  2M active email users with an average activity estimated by us at 10 rubles. <br><br>  Total, we get 2M * 10 rubles = 20M rubles per month, i.e.  about 10M dollars a year. <br><br>  Net profit Yandex in 2006 amounted to 30M dollars, which allows us to talk about the reality of such figures. <br><br>  Obviously, you need to take into account the profits from this project, how much we really increase the audience, and we will not just pay to existing users. <br><br><h1>  <font color="grey">Conclusion</font> </h1><br>  Despite all the difficulties and the high cost of the solution, I believe that email amonetisation is the only way for Yandex to get the active email users it needs. <br><br>  via, <a href="http://gumoza.ru/iTips/14">gumoza.ru</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/30371/">https://habr.com/ru/post/30371/</a></p>
