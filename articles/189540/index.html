  <section class="page js-page"><h1>HP 3PAR StoreServ</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Not so long ago we talked about HP storage systems: it was about <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/hp/blog/186430/"><u>disk libraries</u></a> and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/hp/blog/186844/"><u>comparing them with tape</u></a> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/hp/blog/186430/"><u>libraries</u></a> .  Today we will tell you about the successful experience of non-stop moving from the old storage system to the new HP 3PAR StoreServ of one of the Russian universities. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/eba/c0e/2f9/ebac0e2f92d9d3b4fb0d7f2108ccbc97.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  Foreword </h1><br>  Over the past five years, three arrays of HP EVA data storage systems (DSS) have functioned at HSE (Higher School of Economics), but over time their capacity has been almost completely exhausted.  Expanding storage systems with similar devices turned out to be less profitable than switching to a fully consolidated solution of a higher class, which would provide greater reliability, speed of work and storage efficiency. <br><br>  This upgrade coincided with the start of the reconstruction of one of the university buildings where one of the main server rooms was located, which automatically added another problem that needed to be resolved: all old equipment needed to be decommissioned in the shortest time possible, to ensure data transfer new storage systems without interrupting existing business processes and without compromising system performance.  Well, at least peace in the whole world was not offered, and that is good.  :)

      When choosing a system for which the move will be carried out, the university management considered all the proposals of the main vendors: EMC, Hitachi, IBM, NetApp, and HP.  An IT expertise was conducted, the storage systems were assessed according to the following parameters: high performance, fault tolerance, scalability, modular deployment, delivery and service conditions, warranty obligations and after-sales support.  As a result of the examination, preference was given to the HP 3PAR StoreServ 10400. <br><br><h1>  Work </h1><br>  The most difficult item in the TOR concerned the timing of the work: in three weeks it was necessary to install a new storage system, ensure the data transfer, then stop the work of the current storage system modules and decommission them.  Additionally, the work was complicated by the requirement "not to interfere with users." <br><br>  The project team, which included CROC employees, engineers of the HP service unit and IT specialists at HSE, took an inventory of all active services and assessed their relevance to users.  Based on the information collected, a migration plan was developed: a technological window was assigned for each service, within which the service could be suspended and launched on new equipment.  As a rule, such a stop was made during off-hours (at night or on weekends).  In parallel, a plan was developed for the physical installation of the storage array, in accordance with which new equipment was mounted. <br><br>  At the new site (in the mobile data center), the SAN data network was deployed and configured.  For two weeks, while data migration was performed, the old and new storage systems were used together in the mode of geographically separated sites.  Then, after verifying all transferred data, the HP 3PAR StoreServ storage system was put into commercial operation, and the old storage systems, respectively, were removed. <br><br>  All work on the move was accompanied by a complete step-by-step training course that helped IT specialists at HSE to master all the capabilities of the new storage system.  By participating in the installation of a new storage system together with HP engineers, they could observe the configuration and operation features of 3PAR StoreServ in real conditions. <br><br><h1>  results </h1><br>  The move was carried out on time, all tasks were solved, and most importantly, we were able to ensure all the characteristics stated at the system design stage: specialized software made it possible to transfer 70TB of data with optimization and compression to 40TB. <br><br>  Virtualization of internal capacity and efficient maintenance allowed reducing costs not only for the purchase of physical storage devices, but also for electricity and cooling systems, while not only ‚Äúnot losing‚Äù in system performance, but also providing a good increase in the speed of work. <br><br><h1>  Why choose us </h1><br>  The technologies implemented in 3PAR StoreServ can significantly reduce the disk space occupied by the data.  We provided the university with our forecasts for the required storage capacity and made commitments that if the calculated ratio ‚Äî 40% compression ‚Äî is not justified, then the disks to cover the missing volume will be installed free of charge.  Of all the manufacturers considered storage such guarantees could provide only the company HP.  This became a serious argument in favor of our decision.  In addition, we own a proven proprietary methodology for online data migration from EVA storage systems to 3PAR StoreServ - a necessary condition for the project without stopping operating business services. <br><br>  Consolidated approach, best specialists, quality assurance, excellent post-sales service and the successful implementation of such complex projects - that's why HP is chosen. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/189540/">https://habr.com/ru/post/189540/</a></p>
