Moscow.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  As far as I understand, the program of the performance is the same, but anyone interested can read it, yet a little bit from a different angle) <br><br>  I tried to write down everything Charles said.  And of course the questions. <br>  Let me remind you that the conference was held at MIREA. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Introduction </h4><br><br>  Opera makes browsers, oddly enough, but it is a fact.  We make browsers on desktops, phones, because the web is becoming very common.  Our programs exist on many platforms - from windows 95 to windows vista, Linux, as well as mobile platforms.  We constantly develop and add innovations to our products.  The company was founded by two people 12 years ago, and now it is considered the largest and is represented in 15 countries of the world.  Over the past year we have distributed about 100 million programs.  Russia is the number one country that uses Opera.

      We make two browsers on mobile phones. <br>  We made the opera mobile for the first time 10 years ago.  Over the past 10 years, this browser has evolved and received support for ajax, widgets, and so on.  But smartphones are only a small part of the market.  Opera Mini was the third browser that worked on mobile phones. <br>  How it works? <br>  The phone connects to the proxy, the traffic is compressed and sent back to the client.  It works on almost every phone sold today.  Mini gives you the opportunity to go to the Internet to those people who do not even have a computer, while allowing you to use the same sites as on a regular PC. <br><br>  Shows visitor statistics: <br><br>  1. vkontakte.ru <br>  2. mail.ru <br>  3. yandex.ru <br><br><h4>  Standards </h4><br><br>  Opera tries to adhere to standards.  They make the Internet a platform that is available on each device and allow you to access the Internet as such.  If the standards are made correctly, then people choose it for their applications.  The Internet today is such a platform that is more common than any other. <br><br>  In Opera, 25 employees work on web standards, most of which participate in w3c.  An important principle of this work is that if we invent something interesting we come to w3c and say let's implement our development. <br><br>  Here are a few that our specialists worked on: <br><br>  1. MathMl <br>  2. ECMAScript <br>  3. CSS <br><br><h4>  OperaShow </h4><br><br>  Question to the hall <br>  - who uses Microsoft Powerpoint? <br>  OK. <br>  - who bought Microsoft Powerpoint? <br><br>  "laugh" <br><br>  If you have no money, you can use OperaShow.  This is not a standalone product, but an add-on for the opera.  But the beauty is that the presentation can be read even on a mobile phone.  The basic technology on which everything is built is CSS. <br><br><h4>  Standards in action </h4><br><br>  The prologue about xmlHttpRequest, which made it into ie already 10 years ago.  In general, as it turned out very well and began to develop it.  But as usual, some went to the forest for firewood, so they decided to make a web standard.  How does this happen? <br><br>  We go to some beautiful place.  Arriving at midnight, you begin to work at 8 am.  You sit locked up for 12 hours, you discuss all the subtleties, and then you leave again at 12 o'clock.  All these people are so interested that they discuss it even at dinner.  After five days of such work, a draft of the standard and a draft discussion are published.  All this is open, everyone reads these drafts and writes their own additions.  And after several iterations of viewing such drafts, and comments, we say that the standard is ready.  Then we discuss what should come in and what should not. <br><br>  Here is an example with a browser from Microsoft.  We went to Seattle, the guys from Mozilla, Nokia sat in the room.  Microsoft agreed that what they offered was safe and correct, but it was still not clear enough.  Therefore, we decided to recycle some standards in IE.  All that is needed to change the standards is to spend a certain amount of time together. <br><br><h4>  Widgets </h4><br><br>  Widgets for opera are not so difficult to do.  Widget is a small web application that is installed locally.  (shows the widget hello world in the background the flag of Russia, a calculator and fish) <br><br>  Widget is a small html page.  To simplify the creation of widgets, we made a specification specifically for developers. <br><br>  One of the reasons why widgets need to be developed is because we get an essentially platform independent program that can also be integrated into the desktop. <br>  It is really very simple.  The problem with different platforms was that there was no standard.  Therefore, we gathered and did.  The danger was that, for example, to allow each author to send SMS messages is quite risky.  Information may leak from the address book, or SMS will be sent to a paid number without the user's knowledge. <br><br><h4>  Dragonfly </h4><br><br>  These are tools that allow the developer to debug the browser on the phone.  Dragonfly is a web application, its source code is open under the BSD license. <br><br>  (Shows how he uses dragnfly and how cool it is) <br><br>  Dragonfly works through the scope program interface.  It serves to prevent the debugger from falling when the browser crashes.  Scope allows you to debug almost any device on your favorite Mac.  If you do not understand much you can ask someone to debug remotely. <br><br>  We wanted to standardize Scope so you can use it for any browser. <br><br><h4>  PNG </h4><br><br>  Png was one of the first standards developed by the W3C.  In fact, it is very difficult for a long and expensive.  It was positioned as a replacement for gif, for which you have to pay.  And what I like about w3c is there is a certain patent policy, if someone has a patent, then he gives it to the public.  Who does not want to give, that persuade :) <br><br><h4>  Svg </h4><br><br>  Scg is a standard for some graphics that scale perfectly, the picture looks great for any size.  The same format is intended not only for static graphics, but also for animation.  He has a simple idea that almost everyone understands, so it‚Äôs easy to figure it out. <br><br><h4>  canvas </h4><br><br>  Svg is of course a wonderful format, it‚Äôs easy to work with, but you need to implement a vector graphics library at the same time.  There is another approach where a lot of memory is not allowed.  Comes to the rescue software interface canvas, which is implemented in the browser. <br><br>  (Shows the similarity of counter-strike on html5) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/048/401/391/0484013918d4411b5ae60ae40d3e8780.jpg"><br><br>  The best thing is that it will all work on any browser and any device, although it is more difficult to implement, but it's worth it. <br><br><h4>  HTML5 </h4><br><br>  Now, to view the video, you need to have various plugins, again, you need to try to output video through these plugins.  But wouldn't it be great to say ‚Äúthis video‚Äù, insert the appropriate tag and make it play.  HTML5 has already implemented such functions, moreover, you can change the controls on your own. <br><br>  With svg, you can implement effects by applying filters. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e9c/1f7/386/e9c1f73864ad35bd64757cf993e9dc6c.jpg"><br><br>  You can also make an animation with the video object.  But the most important thing is that it takes a little less than a page. <br><br><h4>  Other news </h4><br><br>  3DCanvas - an area for displaying 3d objects.  We are developing it, and Mozilla is also working on it. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/650/be2/59e/650be259ebe8afddc02935cc4eaa3949.jpg"><br>  (Shows a three-dimensional demonstration, a game like a snake) <br><br><h4>  Questions: </h4><br><br>  Q: <i>Why is not so good support for Google applications?</i> <br>  A: Problems both in the code of these applications and in the browser itself.  Also because of the high rate of development of these applications.  We are working on a fix. <br><br>  Q: <i>What does opera earn?</i> <br>  A: We assign people like you to one side, and then we take away all that they have.  (joke) <br>  There are 2 models to make money: <br>  The first is to make free products, but they pay for the tabs - Yahu, ebey, Yandex, etc. <br>  The second is the traditional model making applications.  Mostly wholesale. <br>  Suppose someone comes and says - ‚Äúwe need a browser,‚Äù and we make a special version for them. <br><br>  Q: <i>How do you focus on the ACID3 test?</i>  <i>Are you targeting it or testing it yourself?</i> <br>  A: Yes, we are working on passing the ACID3 test, we did an internal build that went through it 100%, but then again the test changed again.  Then we did it again, but there were some patent problems.  Plus, we have some concerns that are more important in a given period of time.  Suppose the same optimization under Google. <br><br>  Q: <i>Which browser is the fastest?</i> <br>  A: Guess) <br>  Joke, in fact, performance depends on what you do.  You can always find such a test that any browser runs faster.  A few years ago, opera was faster in a java script, and nobody cared about it.  But now more and more large Java applications, now we are working on optimization. <br><br>  Q: <i>How do you promote opera?</i> <br>  A: We do not have much money for advertising.  But we are developing, we are looking for new marketing moves.  Last year, the number of users in Russia increased by 50%, this year we expect the same amount. <br><br>  Q: <i>What do you think about HTML5?</i> <br>  A: It will be widely used. <br><br>  Q: <i>What is the average salary of a programmer at the opera?</i> <br>  A: It depends on how smart you are. <br>  Opera pays a decent salary, you will not starve.  Opera is a company in which you can change the world, see the world, but you can hardly buy it.  Salary worthy. <br><br>  Q: <i>Opera and crisis.</i> <br>  A: The crisis has hardly touched us.  The only restriction is when you approach an ATM, it limits you in withdrawing a $ 1,000 bill;) <br>  The crisis has affected employees a bit.  But in general, the damage from the global crisis is not noticeable.  Now is a good time for me to buy a house, or next year) <br>  I am glad that I work in an office that has a serious business and is growing. <br><br>  Q: <i>What will be the new options in opera version 10?</i> <br>  A: I can tell you this: <br>  Let's go behind the house where the trash cans, I can tell you, but only one will return) <br>  Performance, quality, standards support, support for new software interfaces, there are several interesting innovations.  But I can‚Äôt say anything more, let it be a surprise, even less than a few months until the release of the tenth version. <br><br>  <b>UPD</b> Unsubscribe those who went to the cafe later, please) <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/44386/">https://habr.com/ru/post/44386/</a></p>
