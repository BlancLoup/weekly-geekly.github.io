      <b>People</b>  We are young, nimble and hungry.  The average age in our team is <b>23.5</b> years.  Four years ago there were three of us, now - <b>72</b> !  We changed our office every year due to the growth of the state. <br>  Someone went all the way from the very beginning, someone came recently.  And we did not fire anyone in connection with the crisis, and at its height ‚Äî in October 2008 ‚Äî we hired <b>12</b> new colleagues.  We believe in what we do, and we try to do well.  Each new employee receives as a gift the best antivirus, over time - a T-shirt, and sometimes a baseball bat :-).  We also have a corporate guitar, a lot of drinkers (but in moderation :-)), sometimes we sing, we love pizza.  And when it's completely boring, we <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/eset/blog/53381/">paint the girls</a> or the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/eset/blog/59878/">doors</a> .  In general, we have a good team of <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/eset/blog/58476/">viral killers</a> . <br><br>  <b>Pioneers</b> .  In order to become the best, we have done a lot in the anti-virus market in Russia or in the first among ESET representative offices. <br>  # 1 is the highest growth rate of anti-virus sales in the last four years in Russia. <br>  # 1 - according to the <a href="http://esetnod32.ru/company/news.php%3FELEMENT_ID%3D5384">loyalty of</a> antivirus <a href="http://esetnod32.ru/company/news.php%3FELEMENT_ID%3D5384">users</a> in Russia (according to Comcon, 2008). <br>  No. 1 - the first made training videos for <a href="http://esetnod32.ru/partner/partner1.php">partners</a> and <a href="http://www.esetnod32.ru/support/">customers</a> . <br>  ‚Ññ1 - started using viral marketing in Russia for antiviruses (more than <b>200,000</b> views of each <a href="http://www.youtube.com/verify_age%3F%26next_url%3D/watch%253Ffeature%253Dchannel_page%2526v%253DczhJ9J6iNzs">cartoon</a> ). <br>  ‚Ññ1 - introduced a free technical support number for CIS <b>8-800</b> , the first in Russia. <br>  ‚Ññ1 - introduced VIP-support for large customers (more than <b>500</b> nodes). <br>  No. 1 is the largest range of antiviruses in retail ( <b>8</b> positions). <br>  No. 1 is <a href="http://esetnod32.ru/company/news.php%3FELEMENT_ID%3D5506">the largest</a> non-state contract for antivirus in <b>2008</b> - more than <b>22,000</b> nodes for <b>3</b> years. <br>  No. 1 - <b>75% of</b> our partners in Russia use NOD32 (1C, etc.). <br>  ... <br>  And this is not a complete list! <br><br>  <b>Antivirus</b> .  We are proud to sell a good product, NOD32 has a lot of fans.  We help protect the most valuable things Internet users have ‚Äî photos of children, online wallets, personal correspondence and personal videos.  In just one month, more <b>than 1,000,000</b> people visit our website in Russia, and more than <b>900,000</b> monthly downloads of Russian demos are available (including the CIS, Germany, Israel, the USA and other countries with large Russian communities)! <br><br>  <b>Customers</b>  The first client in Russia was from the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãButovo (Moscow), he remains our user until now.  He first bought a home version through the website.  In Russia, we are used by more <b>than 4,000,000</b> people (in fact, families where NOD32 is installed), every third computer in the Russian Federation is protected by ESET NOD32.  We were chosen by more than <b>30,000</b> companies (legal customers with more than <b>10</b> computers) and, probably, as many illegally :-).  Every day, while you are going to work from home, you can see at least <b>5‚Äì10 of</b> our clients, from Stordogs eateries to MTV and Yandex. <br><br>  <b>Partners</b> .  We have more than <b>300</b> partners.  This is a little, all our competitors have a larger number.  But for us the old friend is better than the new two. <br>  We are especially grateful to those who work with us from the very first year of work - from <b>2,005th</b> , who believed in NOD32 before it became known in Russia. <br>  Our partners are completely different - someone has two employees, and someone has 2000, and they sell our antivirus from Pyt-Yakh to Gorno-Altaisk.  Thank!!! <br><br>  <b>Competitors</b> .  In the dispute between youth and experience, experience always wins.  And we were young ... and our competitors helped us become experienced.  Not only we, but also our clients, benefited from this.  Kaspersky taught us marketing, Dr.  Web - work with providers, Symantec and McAfee just showed how to do in Russia is not necessary. <br>  But we also gave our competitors a lot, we need each other as experienced athletes.  ‚ÄúCola‚Äù or ‚ÄúPepsi‚Äù, Windows or Apple, Nikon or Canon, Yandex or Google, NOD32 or Kaspersky ?! <br><br>  <b>Errors</b> .  We had many mistakes, we quickly ran forward, sometimes fell, sometimes it was very painful.  There were personnel errors and technical.  Some put us on the edge of the abyss, but we got out, because we really wanted to win.  More than a year ago, the server "died", all mail was stored there and in general all the information for three years (more than <b>500,000</b> letters), the work got up.  It turned out that we were growing so fast that we didn‚Äôt do back-ups (it was done, but with errors, it did not work out) ... And MS Exchange died every time when trying to raise it (the next service pack wasn‚Äôt , and the restriction on the volume of mail again and again "killed" the server).  The battle lasted three days, but the craftsmen, knowing the undocumented features, still managed to find the reasons, raise the server and save more than <b>95% of the</b> mail and all the data.  A month later story <br>  repeated, this time the ‚Äúiron‚Äù failed, but we were ready.  Since then, we keep at least three encrypted copies in different places. <br>  There was enough experience for everyone ... :-) When you grow up more than <b>100‚Äì400%</b> per year for four years in a row, it's impossible to be in time, somewhere you had to make mistakes. <br>  But we did it!
