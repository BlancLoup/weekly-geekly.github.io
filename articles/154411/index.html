  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Ruby meetings in St. Petersburg are back in fashion</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On Thursday, October 4, the first meeting of the Saint Petersburg Ruby User Group was held at the Ingria Business Incubator.  I would like to conduct some kind of retrospective of the event, take stock, collect opinions and tell about future plans. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The St. Petersburg ruby ‚Äã‚Äãcommunity for a long time (since March 2009) held meetings and organized in various ways, but last year everything calmed down, so we decided to take everything into our own hands, give the business a new move and try to make the meetings not one-time but quite regular an event.  Thanks to the <a href="http://resumup.com/">ResumUP</a> company and the <a href="http://ingria-startup.ru/">Ingria</a> business incubator for sponsorship and all kinds of assistance. <br><br>  To begin with, we were very surprised at the number of visitors.  We were afraid that all the rubists from the city went away or went to work in a large enterprise, so they wouldn‚Äôt have time for the meetings, but in reality everything turned out to be wrong - more than 30 people attended the meeting, which we consider a great merit, considering how little .

      The event was opened by Mikhail Vaisman, who convinced all the assembled programmers that it was impossible to continue living without organizing <a href="http://railsgirls.com/">Rails Girls</a> .  Programmers agreed and nodded.  Whether this initiative will support further, and whether the city will have its own company of girls railmen will show time. <br><br>  The second was the former organizer of Piter.rb, Pavel Timofeev, who now went to Chile and is creating a startup there.  This, in fact, Pavel told about it as he would like to almost anyone who wants to move to Chile, receive a grant from the government and work on his idea. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3f5/255/786/3f5255786253cc4d9d13499108a34074.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The following four reports were more technical.  Nikolai Ryzhikov talked about how to develop a project in the field of medicine using ruby.  But there were no medical details there, just an interesting story about the life of a large and complex software product and that on the tracks you can really do something more complicated and more blog. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f80/e05/95d/f80e0595ddde3ee75ed824806de76932.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Ilya Zayats tried to convey the idea that inheriting classes responsible for the business logic from ActiveRecord :: Base - moveton made an easy insight into the concept of DDD and a general overview of the current trend OOP on Rails. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/86f/b84/242/86fb8424252d003c3f86e336f0ceb13e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Sergey Efremov told how in 10 minutes and in one team to create, configure, deploy the application and include an instance on Amazon EC2 into balancing using rubber heme.  If you use Amazon, think about the convenience of deployment / settings and you have more than one server, then we advise you to familiarize yourself with the <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/u/evilfaeton/p/easy-deploy-and-manage-ec2-i">slides</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f3a/591/1fb/f3a5911fb0fc55647bc045e35bb527ab.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Vyacheslav Shebanov completed the report with a report not from the world of Ruby - ‚ÄúThinking Reactively.  Meteor.js Framework.  Slava was actively trying to convey the idea that the rails are no longer fashionable for a long time, and you need to write everything and everywhere in JavaScript.  An interesting report on the expansion of horizons. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d44/2d9/a2b/d442d9a2b3afe9a8e2e5c7abff13ecc0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The plans for the next meeting (the date of which is already known - 10/31/2012), nevertheless, try to further deviate from the format of the conference and give participants the opportunity to hold backstage conversations.  As the experience of the breaks between the reports this time showed, there is a desire among the participants to communicate. <br><br>  We are open to any suggestions, comments and remarks that in the comments that the <a href="">mail</a> .  Actively looking for nugget speakers, and most importantly - lists of topics that you would like to hear about.  It is also rumored that next time there will even be coffee breaks.  In general, expect news. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/154411/">https://habr.com/ru/post/154411/</a></p>
