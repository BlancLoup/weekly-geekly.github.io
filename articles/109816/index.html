There was no limit to unpacking and listening.  It turned out that these headphones do not drag on this player: neither the bass nor the detailed high frequencies.  Overall unpleasant.  For a while I was like, like, and sold them by buying the Fischer Equilibrium.  I do not want to throw a stone in a phisher garden, they are beautiful, but it was Koss who wanted it. <br>  And after a while, I suddenly find out that there are such things as portable amplifiers.  Searching and reading for a long time, I stopped at the products of the Chinese company <a href="http://fiio.com.cn/en/">FiiO</a> . <br>  Not really trusting our mail, and indeed, not eager to wait a few weeks, I looked to see whether they could be bought from us in St. Petersburg.  It turned out that no (I do not exclude that I was looking badly).  But there was still a person who carries these same E3s from abroad, and the very next day I was the owner of a small white box with a device. <br><br><h4>  Specifications </h4><br><ul><li>  Headphone impedance: 16 ohms - 300 ohms </li><li>  Output power: 120 mW (16 ohms);  70 mW (32 ohms);  12 mW (300 Ohm) </li><li>  Distortion: &lt;0.05% (10 mW) </li><li>  Signal / Noise Ratio: ‚â• 90 dB (weighted) </li><li>  Frequency range: 10 Hz - 40 kHz. </li><li>  Power supply: 1 AAA battery </li><li>  Dimensions: 55 mm (D) √ó 23 mm (W) √ó 14.5 mm (H) </li><li>  Weight: 11g (without battery) </li><li>  Body Material: Plastic </li><li>  Color: Black or White </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a48/94f/dda/a4894fddafda681c4f6bce78bb66bc07.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Appearance and inside </h4><br>  The kit is small - a device, wire 3.5-3.5 15cm and waste paper.  The battery was disdained, but the batteries are not a shortage. <br><img src="http://images04.olx.ru/ui/5/13/42/1273690341_93081142_1--Fiio-E3--1273690341.jpg" alt="image">

      So what is this little box? <br>  This is a miniature parallelepiped with two entrances above and below.  Both at 3.5mm.  The output with a headphone icon is equipped with a red diode that comes on after plugging in the headphones.  Side door for AAA battery. <br>  No buttons, no switches - turned off by pulling the headphones. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/76/88/76885b53311db8c37b17b068aa5156ff.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The case is plastic, glossy.  Scratched on the first day, but given the constant life in your pocket - there is not much difference. <br><br>  The inside is the National Semiconductor LM4917 amplifier.  Honestly, this does not tell me anything, but if someone understands, maybe it plays a role. <br><br><h4>  Sound </h4><br>  Well, now about the main thing. <br>  Since there was no opportunity to immediately try the Porta Pro with an amplifier, I stuck my Equilibrium there.  Friends, it was tin.  The sound was very noticeably distorted, became very noisy and artifact.  I was already suspicious, but I was lucky that my girlfriend was walking with Porta Pro, so I borrowed them for a day. <br>  And it was a real holiday!  The sound was almost like from my Asus Xonar - crisp, juicy, with great bass (from the track ‚ÄúGlacial Supremacy‚Äù I had goose bumps - it was so cool).  It is felt that the low frequencies are slightly amplified (by 5-6 dB), and I, as their fan, are only too happy about it. <br>  As for the amplification of sound, it is almost absent.  Those.  If I used to listen at 30/50 volume points, now it‚Äôs 25/50.  It is worth making a reservation here that I mostly listen to trailer music and a bit of rock, as with other genres, I can't say. <br>  However, there are places (even though there are few of them and a crane) when small artifacts begin to appear at such a volume.  And the louder and closer to the maximum, the stronger they become.  However, this can be attributed to the quality of mp3 audio.  With flac, I did not find such problems. <br>  The battery of the player seems to have decided not to be discharged at all - I don‚Äôt remember when I last put it on charge.  But the amp itself sits pretty quickly - in 10-12 hours. <br>  Another drawback is the fact that the box itself, despite its miniature size, is rather strongly interfering in your pocket, so I tore off the clip from some kind of headset and glued it to the case.  Now I wear amp on the belt and the wires are not confused. <br>  In order to stop disputes in advance regarding E3 and E5, I will say that they sound almost identical in sound, basically they differ in appearance: the E5 has its own battery, another body and clip. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/314/4a2/571/3144a2571b2ac5d136863b4c00f23a4a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Although in fairness it should be said that the E5 copes better with high volume.  Another thing is that a little <br>  what ears will survive after the full volume of D2, and even a little more amplified. <br>  Now about the price: as I said, I bought in a hurry and impudently, so I gave 500re.  Those who can wait can order an <a href="http://www.dealextreme.com/details.dx/sku.14303">amp</a> on the <a href="http://www.dealextreme.com/details.dx/sku.14303">Diacstream</a> for only $ 6.49 <br>  You can of course be able to build for a long time that it‚Äôs easier to solder your own, but this device is worth its micro-money.  Frankly, I did not even expect such a sound from such a baby. <br>  Thank you all for your attention! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/109816/">https://habr.com/ru/post/109816/</a></p>
