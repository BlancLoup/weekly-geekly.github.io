What to do when there are more risks than opportunities?  The answer is obvious - you need something new.  Only a new one should be not only a product / service, but also a business tool.  Under the kat case about how to "correctly" use risks. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>The important thing is not to win but to take part</b> <br>  The market is saturated with the entire line of popular fitness offers, but the main struggle is only among the major players.  Research results show that in proportion to the increase in the level of well-being, rows of fitness fans are also growing.  At the same time, the niche of premium class sports halls is still not occupied.  Small fitness operators are in a highly competitive environment.  Yes, the crisis has made its own adjustments to the plans of owners of fitness companies: according to independent surveys, more than a quarter of respondents said they are ready to save on such services. <br><br>  <b>Attention, question: So what kind of Central Asian orientation?</b>

To keep the client, everything should be as simple as possible - this is the trend of modern times.  On the Internet, we observe how the design is simplified: unnecessary banners are removed, buttons, a feedback form and that is shortened to ‚ÄúEnter your number‚Äù. <br><br>  <i>Example: A friend of mine decided to order pizza.</i>  <i>He took the phone, opened the first site in the issue: yes - beautiful pizza photos, but the order form with 3+ fields made him close the site.</i>  <i>‚ÄúWhy should I enter my index in the address?</i>  <i>I don't even know him! ‚ÄùThe hungry man found another site, where all he had to do was enter his phone number.</i>  <i>The dispatcher immediately contacted him and within a few minutes the order was confirmed.</i>  <i>‚ÄúMaybe on that site the pizza was tastier.</i>  <i>The fed does not understand the hungry, I do not want to enter my address when I want to eat. "</i> <br><br>  It is important to understand that we are talking about working with the client.  It is our attitude towards the client that forms the opinion of the company among Central Asia.  Yes, you can produce top-end products or provide the highest quality services, but if a client does not like your attitude, all efforts are in vain.  It would seem - ‚Äúhow unfair!‚Äù, But this scheme works in a positive way: a good attitude towards the client can ‚Äúcover‚Äù your professional shortcomings, but not vice versa.  Such is the paradox of the Russian market. <br><br>  <b>Let's go back to the gym</b> <br>  In this case, we will consider making decisions on the ‚Äúexclude cannot be used‚Äù method, the meaning of which is to interact with as much of Central Asia as possible without loss of conversion.  Yes, we will try to please everyone!  (or almost everyone) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0be/78d/975/0be78d975640664ad17ed17a845d3b4e.jpg" width="550" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>TASK: To make the gym "for everyone"</b> <b><br><br></b>  <b>RISK: Classes will be attended by people from different backgrounds</b> <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">ANSWER</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  It is impossible to avoid audience heterogeneity.  That is, we need to take advantage of this situation, turn the threat into an opportunity. <br></div></div><br><blockquote>  If problems cannot be avoided, then it should be used. </blockquote><br>  <b>Pay for the first or second!</b> <br><br>  The contingent of people attending fitness clubs is not unambiguous.  This may be people with great wealth, and may be people from the lower social strata.  The reasons for visiting can also be different: for some it is a tribute to fashion, but for others it is a necessary measure.  Also, the representatives of each category behave differently: some behave capriciously and arrogantly, speak disrespectfully, others - too sociable, intrusive and uncultured.  Sometimes the differences reach tacit conflicts that prevent people from engaging in activities together. <br><br>  Eliminating all negative situations is impossible, but to avoid most of them is a doable task.  For example, a fitness club can sew a uniform for customers in the same style, taking measurements before issuing a subscription.  Thus, customers will not know who is who before leaving class.  This is a long-term investment that guarantees no outflow of customers due to the problems described above.  In addition, nothing prevents then bring sports suits as a separate product, it will only support the brand.  If we omit the details as much as possible, then, due to the potential risk, we have found an accompanying product. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b20/f85/1c7/b20f851c7be1d55ee6f332fe7e106b27.jpg" width="550" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>The calculation is over!</b> <br>  This decision-making method also helps to manage risks: we make new opportunities and advantages out of potential threats.  This way of thinking is applicable everywhere: analyze your product again - it is likely that you should add a number of innovations and the risks will be reduced. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/323596/">https://habr.com/ru/post/323596/</a></p>
