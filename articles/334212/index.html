      But only often the list is exhausted by this, alas.  Of course, the opportunity to get a 2-NDFL with a large amount for a mortgage will fit someone as a bonus, but I heard about irresponsible bookkeeping ( <i>one of my friends, Count DlF even worked in that</i> ), who in 2-NDFL will write as much as necessary, even if you have officially 30k (in Moscow), and the rest is a bonus, a bonus, and sometimes an envelope. <br><br>  For the convenience of interviewing HRs at interviews, the list below was compiled.  The list, of course, is very intangible in some places - but it is easily converted into rubles. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>I'll start with the material</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Salary: white, gray or both.  And in what proportion.  How much salary, how much bonus, is there any. </li><li>  Award.  Are they related to KPI and is there any. </li><li>  Reverse premium - fines.  Is, for what and from where are deducted. </li><li>  Indexation of RFP for inflation </li><li>  Processing, work on weekends, their frequency, payment. </li><li>  Work outside the plan - for example, the elimination of accidents.  Payment, terms of payment. </li><li>  Is there a re-certification system for and not the results, "grades" and other things, and how it all works. </li><li>  Pension plans.  Of course, 401 (k) is not in the Russian Federation, but it can be clarified. </li><li>  SUDDENLY relevant to the Russian Federation.  Even for some large (really large) organizations, what have you done with RFP delays over the past year. </li><li>  Also in some financial institutions and oil and gas companies they offer a preferential mortgage or housing improvement program. </li><li>  True, the author and critics / colleagues, over the years have not met colleagues successfully participating in this program.  At the same time, loans (sometimes irrevocable, or at 0%) for top management are more than permanent. </li></ul><br>  <b>Not material, but influencing life and fate</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Will work with the state secret </li><li>  Will and how much will the SAT check take. </li><li>  What are the conditions and duration of the trial period </li></ul><br>  <b>Now not material, but still not bonuses</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Work schedule - 8-17, 9-18, interchangeable, other options.  The possibility of shifting the schedule by + - hour. </li><li>  The severity of control of the schedule.  Do I have to come strictly 2 minutes before, or how. </li><li>  The schedule itself - lunch, breaks for a smoke / tea / other.  Strictly 5 minutes / hour, or free. </li></ul><br>  Dress code.  Is there a strict not strict. <br><br>  Holidays, and especially the call from vacation <br><br><ul><li>  There is such a thing as the transfer of affairs during the holidays (substitution).  How it is arranged, arranged, whether it is practiced at all. </li><li>  Travel on vacation (relevant for near-Russian Railways, near-air and in some regions). </li><li>  Care from half a day - for example, to the dental or other tasks. </li></ul><br>  <b>Intangible: LCA and other HLS</b> <br><br><ul><li>  LCA.  Is the dentistry included in the DMS and to what extent? </li><li>  Fitness (your own or bonuses / discounts) </li><li>  1-2 days of illness without clearance. </li><li>  Surcharge for the time of illness at the full rate, and not according to the standard CHI. </li><li>  Insurance (dms) for children. </li><li>  Life insurance is also present in some places and insurance for traveling abroad (a trifle but pleasant, especially when you need to do such a visa on a visa). </li><li>  A doctor in the office who can prescribe what kind of medicine or initial examination to conduct. </li><li>  Yes, at least just a first aid kit in the office.  <i>Note - the author from the days of work as an assembler of computers from govnokorpusov used to keep his first-aid kit at work - a bandage, a plaster, iodine, a peroxide, and a universal pill - from the head and the second half.</i>  Since the author is <i>also a bit bold and slightly moronic</i> (not like <i>some designers</i> , of course), there is also a tourniquet in the first-aid kit, and chlorhexidine, and a thermometer (electronic), and something else.  And, suddenly, acyclovir, after observing colleagues with swollen physiognomy. </li></ul><br>  <b>Healthy lifestyle</b> <br><br>  The presence of bicycle parking (open / closed) and, for example, a shower.  Again, it is important in the elimination of serious accidents, when sometimes you have to spend a day or two at work. <br><br>  <b>Kitchen</b> <br><br><ul><li>  What about meals, your dining room or just the kitchen, with a coffee machine (free - your coffee or something) or a coffee machine and microwave, and a refrigerator. </li><li>  Are there food bonuses in the local canteen. </li><li>  Nearest shops. </li><li>  Can I drink coffee / tea / juice-water in the workplace. </li></ul><br>  <b>Transport</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Parking (relevant for MSC). </li><li>  Is, open / closed, what and how with payment. </li><li>  Corporate transport, service travel (in 1c like it was). </li></ul><br>  <b>Specificity of transport in the Russian Federation</b> <br><br>  Sometimes they can offer a service car (or Renault Logan instead of a car) or offer compensation for using their own car <i>(But are you ready to use your own car for 1000 (one) thousand rubles a month - I saw such an announcement).</i> <br><br>  But in general, for work in near-IT (for example, servicing cash and related equipment in stores), a company car is a common occurrence.  There may be tricks with the payment of gasoline (limits, by check, etc.). <br><br>  <b>Availability</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Cell phone (office, relevant for those who are always in touch, even on vacation). </li><li>  Is the ‚Äúon the phone‚Äù state both on weekends and on vacation, too, or what?  Payment of the stay "on the phone in zone 3 of hourly physical accessibility / with access to the Internet and availability anywhere in the world, even on vacation." </li><li>  Work from home.  Is it possible, how often. </li><li>  Payment of the Internet (sometimes in some places). </li></ul><br>  <b>Study</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Study in the specialty.  Is there what are the conditions.  Is there testing and other conditions.  How many years is the term of slavery when you pay for your office.  Including the trip, let's say at VMworld. </li><li>  Will they be released on study leave (if they study at the institute)? </li><li>  How will absenteeism take place if he paid for his studies - as a vacation at his own expense, as a deduction from a vacation or as a study vacation?  Or just close your eyes by some kind of agreement? </li></ul><br>  <i><b>Note</b> : In general, implicit arrangements with a number of executives should be avoided.</i>  <i>It is much easier that all this was carried out through the personnel department, and then there was no stating "who thought what."</i> <br><br><ul><li>  Discounts or any training courses in the office (foreign language) or affiliate programs </li><li>  The organization has a subscription to any MSDN </li><li>  Availability of partnership courses for bonuses (from integrators and large sellers) </li><li>  Having an organization‚Äôs connections to send to all kinds of free courses for 1-3 days, sometimes even during working hours. </li></ul><br>  <b>Business trips and work in branches / offices.</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Business trips For conducting studies to someone, such as giving lectures and reports. </li><li>  Prospects and objectives for the next six months to a year. </li></ul><br>  <b>Workplace</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Just show the workplace. </li><li>  That at least just from a PC - because it is sometimes convenient for IT to keep two monitors.  Sometimes three, monitoring is displayed on the third. </li><li>  What with lighting, ventilation, equipment.  It is warm / cold, especially in the case of cold beams and tightly closed windows (which are not openable in principle).  Noise, convenience.  The degree of open-space.  Ability to put your humidifier. </li><li>  Availability of CO / CO2 control.  Saw in one office (one campaign from a habr, I want to notice) such live. </li><li>  Any office bonus zones - mini-negotiations, table tennis, etc. </li></ul><br>  <b>Corporate and team building</b> <br><br><ul><li> Is there anything like that, as far as marasmic.  Because the corporate level "here you $ 100 per department, then yourself" differs from the corporate party with running competitions in bags and corn-queen of the fields. </li></ul><br>  Replenishment is welcome. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/334212/">https://habr.com/ru/post/334212/</a></p>
