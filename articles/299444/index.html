  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Government experts: in the case of introducing measures to regulate OTT services, the RF budget will lose 10 billion rubles a year</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The working group under the government of the Russian Federation discusses the issues of regulating the market for audio-visual and communication services on the Internet.  These services include, for example, online cinemas and instant messengers.  Nowadays, additional regulation of TV, video, and audio services on the Internet is ‚Äúinexpedient and redundant,‚Äù since the laws On Information and On Countering Extremist Activities already apply to them, experts say. <br><br>  In early March, the Media Communication Union ( <a href="http://np-mks.ru/ru">MKS</a> ), which brings together the largest operators and media holdings, proposed to regulate the operation of online cinemas in Russia.  It was proposed to introduce a notification procedure for the operation of such companies, as well as to create a register of audiovisual services. <br><br>  The ISS proposed to oblige online cinemas to show at least 80% of all products in Russian, as well as to introduce a mandatory quota for films and series produced in the Russian Federation in the amount of 30%.

      In addition, the organizers of audiovisual services are required to provide access to all services throughout the Russian Federation.  Yesterday, the head of Roskomnadzor, Alexander Zharov, supported the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãregulating the online cinema market, although he noted that the corresponding bill was not ready yet. <br><br>  "Excessive or incorrect" regulation will lead to restriction of competition. <a name="habracut"></a>  Moreover, such measures can significantly reduce the economic efficiency and investment attractiveness of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/OTT">OTT services</a> . <br><br>  ‚ÄúThis may adversely affect the activities of a number of related sectors of the national economy.  Thus, the domestic film industry will lose the new medium for the distribution of content, communication operators - traffic, the state - tax payments, ‚Äùexperts explain. <br><br>  "Failure to pay taxes - and therefore, the loss of the budget of the Russian Federation - may amount to about 10 billion rubles a year," said the head of the working group, Mikhail Yakushev.  The same assessment is given in the conclusion, in the development of which <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B0%25D0%25A4%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD">MegaFon</a> , <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25A2%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25A1%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D1%258B">MTS</a> , <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2592%25D1%258B%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB-%25D0%259A%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BC%25D1%2583%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8">VimpelCom</a> , <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25AF%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2581">Yandex</a> and other market players participated.  Strengthening legal services is beneficial to pirates, experts say. <br><br>  Additional restrictions and regulations for legal video services are superfluous, Viktor Chekanov, general director of the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megogo.net">Megogo</a> online cinema in Russia, told Kommersant: "Our activities are transparent, the established rules of operation are observed from copyright holders to sellers and advertisers."  According to him, ‚Äúdubious initiatives call into question the feasibility of further investments in the industry, the development of products and the services themselves.‚Äù <br><br>  According to the company J'son &amp; Partners Consulting, the market for legal video services in Russia in 2015 <a href="https://megamozg.ru/post/24834/">grew</a> by 15%.  At the end of 2015, its volume reached 8.5 billion rubles. <br>  Approaches to the regulation of OTT services should differ, government experts believe: ‚ÄúTransferring the usual logic of regulating broadcasting services to OTT services on the Internet is incorrect due to fundamental differences in technology and business models.‚Äù <br><br>  The report of J'son &amp; Partners Consulting notes that the entry of new major players into the Russian market is unlikely, but it is possible to strengthen the existing ones.  A prime example is the emergence of Netflix in Russia in early 2016.  Moreover, representatives of the online cinema Netflix <a href="https://rns.online/internet/Roskomnadzor-dogovarivaetsya-o-vstreche-s-Netflix-2016-03-17/">agreed to</a> discuss the rules of work in Russia with Roskomnadzor.  They intend to find a solution that will suit everyone. <br><br>  The introduction of VAT on the sale of digital content can slow down the development of this segment in the next few years.  After all, market players will not be able to pay sales taxes without increasing the cost of content for users. <br><br>  From a technical point of view, it is also incorrect to regulate messengers by analogy with a communication service, since this is not a communication service, but software.  According to the amendments to the Laws "On Information" and "On Communications" developed by Roskomnadzor, messengers can function in Russia only under an agreement with telecom operators, and their users must be identified - otherwise operators are threatened with blocking. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299444/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299444/</a></p>
