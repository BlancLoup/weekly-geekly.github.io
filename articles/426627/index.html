  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Flexbox usage examples</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p>  I continue to publish Rachel Andrew articles on the features of <strong>Flexbox</strong> CSS technology <strong>.</strong> </p><br><p>  <strong>Previous articles of the cycle:</strong> </p><br><ol><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/post/424419/">What happens when you create a <strong>Flexbox</strong> container</a> . </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/post/425881/">Everything you need to know about alignment in the <strong>Flexbox</strong></a> . </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/post/425977/"><strong>Flexbox:</strong> how big is this flexible box?</a>  . </li></ol><br><hr><br><p>  We come to the final part of my <strong>Flexbox</strong> series here in <strong>Smashing Magazine</strong> .  In this post, I‚Äôm going to spend some time thinking about what the <strong>Flexbox</strong> options are actually using, given that we now have a <strong>CSS Grid Layout</strong> , I‚Äôll give some suggestions on what you can use when and how. </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2 id="ranee-v-etoy-serii">  Earlier in this series </h2><br><p>  If you haven't selected other articles yet, this is essentially the final post, so look at them first.  I start by describing <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/08/flexbox-display-flex-container/">what happens when creating a <strong>flex</strong> container</a> .  In the second article of the series, I looked at the <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/08/flexbox-alignment/">alignment</a> and how we align the elements along the main and transverse axes during <strong>flexbox</strong> .  In the third article, I unpack <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/09/flexbox-sizing-flexible-box/">how resizing in the Flexbox works</a> , and how the browser determines how large the flex element should be.  Now that we know exactly how <strong>Flexbox</strong> works, we can turn around to think about the use cases for which this is best. </p><br><h2 id="ya-dolzhna-ispolzovat-grid-ili-flexbox">  Should I use a Grid or Flexbox? </h2><br><p>  This is still the main question I‚Äôm asked when I learn how to build, and in general I think that as people get used to working with new methods, it becomes a question that you need to ask yourself less often.  As your experience grows, you will understand which layout method to use. </p><br><p> However, if you are just starting to grasp this idea, remember that <strong>CSS Grid Layout</strong> and <strong>Flexbox</strong> are both CSS.  If you specify <code>display: grid</code> or <code>display: flex</code> , you often use more common than differences.  Both <strong>Grid</strong> and <strong>Flexbox</strong> use properties that are part of the <strong>Box Alignment</strong> specification;  both rely on concepts detailed in the <strong>Intrinsic and Extrinsic Sizing CSS</strong> specification <strong>.</strong>  . </p><br><p>  Asking whether your design should use a <strong>Grid</strong> or <strong>Flexbox is</strong> similar to the question of whether your design should use font size or color.  You should probably use both if required.  And no one will haunt you if you use the wrong one. </p><br><p>  So we don‚Äôt choose between <strong>Vue.js</strong> and <strong>React</strong> , <strong>Bootstrap</strong> or <strong>Foundation</strong> .  We use <strong>CSS</strong> to build, and we need to use CSS particles that make the most sense for a particular part of our design that we are working on.  Review each component and decide what is best for it, or which combination of elements is best for it. </p><br><p>  This can be a <strong>Grid</strong> , or it can be a <strong>Flexbox</strong> .  This may be an external <strong>Grid</strong> container in which some mesh elements become flexible or reversible.  There is no problem with the nesting of the grid in the <strong>flex</strong> element, if this is required for your project. </p><br><h2 id="chto-takoe-flexbox-na-samom-dele">  What is Flexbox really? </h2><br><p>  The <strong>Flexbox</strong> specification describes the layout method as follows: </p><br><blockquote>  " <strong>Flex layout</strong> looks similar to <strong>block layout</strong> . It lacks many more complex text or document-oriented properties that can be used in block layout, such as <strong>floats</strong> and <strong>columns</strong> . Instead, it received simple and powerful tools for allocating space and leveling content in a way that which web applications and complex web pages have long needed. ‚Äù </blockquote><p>  I think the key phrase here is ‚Äúspace allocation and content alignment‚Äù.  <strong>Flexbox</strong> is all about taking a bunch of items (which have different sizes) and putting them in a container (which itself can be a variable size).  <strong>Flexbox</strong> is soft.  He tries to create the best layout for our elements, giving larger elements more space, and smaller elements less space, thereby preserving the readability of the content. </p><br><p>  If people find the <strong>Flexbox</strong> challenging and mysterious, it is often because they are trying to use the <strong>Flexbox</strong> as a <strong>grid system</strong> , trying to regain control over the size and distribution of space.  When you do this, the <strong>Flexbox</strong> may seem strange and difficult because you are struggling with what <strong>Flexbox</strong> does, i.e.  with its inherent flexibility. </p><br><p>  Therefore, templates that are very well suited for flexible layout are those in which we are not so interested in having the ideal size of each element.  We just want these elements to appear next to each other. </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://codepen.io/rachelandrew/embed/preview/EdPjgE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><p>  There are also templates in which you want to have lines with hyphenation, but you do not need a strict grid.  If we take the original <strong>Grid</strong> vs. <strong>Flexbox example</strong> , where we use the syntax <strong>repeat auto-fill</strong> in the grid, and then the flex-container with line <strong>breaks</strong> , we will immediately see the difference between these two methods. </p><br><p>  In the <strong>Grid</strong> example, the <strong>grid</strong> elements are arranged in rows and columns.  When the number of track columns changes (depending on the space), the elements always go to the next available grid cell.  In fact, there is no way to request a mesh element to surround a track in order to fill in an <strong>auto-flow</strong> script if there are other empty cells. </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://codepen.io/rachelandrew/embed/preview/LgGVyX" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><p>  In the <strong>flex</strong> example, the totals share the space left between them, so we do not use the horizontal and vertical alignment. </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://codepen.io/rachelandrew/embed/preview/vVLOZq" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><p>  If we have <strong>flex-basis</strong> set to <strong>auto</strong> , and any of the flex elements increases, then the rest will also be provided with additional space so that the alignment can be different from line to line. </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://codepen.io/rachelandrew/embed/preview/JmGdEa" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><p>  This is a very vivid example of where we would like to use the <strong>Flexbox</strong> over the <strong>Grid Layout</strong> .  If we want the elements to be wrapped, but to occupy the space they need, in rows.  This is very different from the grid.  Patterns like this can be a set of tags (one or two words that you want to display well as a set of elements) that take up the necessary space and are not rigidly inserted into a strict grid. </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://codepen.io/rachelandrew/embed/preview/EdPVNz" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><p>  Currently, <strong>Flexbox is</strong> also the best way to perform the vertical and horizontal centering of an element inside a container. </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://codepen.io/rachelandrew/embed/preview/BqjoxY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><p>  In the future (if browser support for <strong>Box Alignment</strong> properties outside the flexible layout), we can do this without adding <strong>display: flex</strong> to the container.  At the moment, however, all you need to do is an extra line of CSS, which is not a problem. </p><br><p>  <strong>The Flexbox does</strong> very well with small one-dimensional components.  Sets of form fields, icons, or other information can be easily located and allowed to be flexible without the need to carefully size each element. </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://codepen.io/rachelandrew/embed/preview/vVLNbZ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><p>  You can also select the <strong>Flexbox</strong> in scenarios where the content needs to be brought to the bottom of the container without letting it float.  In the example below, I make the container in a flex container, displaying the contents as a column, and then let the middle grow, pushing the <strong>footer</strong> down the component. </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://codepen.io/rachelandrew/embed/preview/xyZYwY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><p>  When developing, I find that <strong>Flexbox</strong> is useful for many small tasks, performing proper alignment, distributing the space between elements.  You can certainly use a one-dimensional grid container for some of these tasks, and not worry about what you decide to do. </p><br><p>  However, I think that the <strong>Flexbox</strong> will be the best in a situation when you need to add additional elements that I did not expect in my design.  For example, if I have a navigation component using a <strong>Grid</strong> , I would create enough tracks for all elements, since I would not want a new line to be created if I had ‚Äútoo many‚Äù elements.  With <strong>flexbox</strong> , long enough, I would allow the elements to be flexible with <strong>flex-basis</strong> 0 (or <strong>auto</strong> ), then the elements themselves would let the new companion into the line, freeing him a place. </p><br><h2 id="kogda-ne-sleduet-ispolzovat-flexbox">  When should you not use the Flexbox? </h2><br><p>  We looked at some of the considerations for which, I think, you should prefer the <strong>Flexbox</strong> before the <strong>Grid</strong> layout, so now we can explore some of the places where the <strong>Flexbox</strong> may not be the best choice.  We have already looked at our <strong>Flexbox</strong> example against a grid with elements aligned horizontally and vertically against elements that occupy space line by line.  And this difference is the first thing to consider. </p><br><p>  The mesh example has a two-dimensional layout.  Layout row and column at the same time. </p><br><p>  The <strong>Flexbox</strong> example is a one-dimensional layout.  We have packed flex strings, but placement in space is line by line.  Each line, in fact, acts as a new flex-container in the Flex-direction. </p><br><p>  Therefore, if your component needs a two-dimensional layout, you'd better use a <strong>Grid</strong> , not a <strong>Flexbox</strong> .  It does not matter whether it is a large or small component.  If you take one thing from this article, then remove the idea from your head that the <strong>Grid is</strong> for some reason intended only for the layout of the main page, and <strong>Flexbox</strong> for the components.  You can have a tiny component that requires a two-dimensional layout, and a homepage structure that best suits a one-dimensional layout. </p><br><p>  Another good place where a <strong>grid</strong> can be considered the best solution is to use width or set <strong>flex-basis</strong> as a unit of length for your flex elements to align with another line of flex elements or simply limit flexibility in some way.  Quite often, this indicates either that you really need a two-dimensional layout method, or that the control from the grid container is better suited to your layout. </p><br><p>  For example, we could make our flexible layout more similar to the <strong>Grid</strong> , limiting the flexibility of our elements.  Setting <strong>flex-grow</strong> to 0 and calculating the size of elements in percent, similar to how we determined the size of elements in the floating grid.  If you find that you are doing this, I would suggest that the grid layout is the best approach because it is designed for this type of layout. </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://codepen.io/rachelandrew/embed/preview/jeWZyM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><p>  With all this said, remember that very often there is no clear right or wrong answer.  Sometimes the only thing you can do is try different methods and see what is best for the component.  Remember that you can also switch layout methods using the <strong>Flexbox</strong> at one breakpoint and the <strong>Grid</strong> at another. </p><br><h2 id="i-tak-svorachivaemsya">  And so, we turn off! </h2><br><p>  I hope that this <strong>Flexbox</strong> series <strong>has</strong> been useful and has shown how understanding some flex-element alignment and calibration algorithms makes life easier when working with them. </p><br><p>  If you have any unresolved questions or you have a template that does not seem to have an obvious answer in terms of the layout method used, leave a comment. </p></div>
