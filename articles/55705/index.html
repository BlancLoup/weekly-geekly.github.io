    <a name="habracut"></a><h3>  Empty queues </h3>  Many people who come and receive at the terminal a check with their number, see on the check how many people are in front of them.  And, with large queues, just go. <br><br>  The car does not know that the person did not wait for his turn, and in this case about a minute of time is spent after his number is called <s>, but he did not come up</s> . <br><br><h4>  Decision </h4>  I don‚Äôt know exactly why they didn‚Äôt do this right away, and why they print a queue on the check, when you can do it directly on the terminal. <br>  Perhaps the developers think that the person in this case will choose the "operation", based on the queue.  Even if so, nothing terrible, because firstly you can send such people after another check, and secondly, even if you serve them, this means that he did not delay other lines by his presence. <br><br><h3>  Numbering </h3>  Not for nothing, made a voice alert system.  But it is designed for 3 out of 5: <br>  1) The person who determines the hearing information, after several times naming his first two digits of the number, will first start, and then will be afraid to miss his number. <br><br>  Many times, when I have the number 451, I listened, as at first they missed 458, 453, 452, 459. And every time I was straining.  After several failures, a 45n filter was automatically placed in my head, and immediately there was a fear that I would miss my number. <br><br>  2) It is not known how many people are in front of you. <br><br><h4>  Decision </h4>  The system uses numbers from 0 to 999. Now, each normer registers its operation in the queue.  The obvious solution is to group transactions by number. <br>  For example, 100-300 numbers for ‚Äúdeposit operations‚Äù, 300-500 numbers for ‚ÄúPayment transactions‚Äù, 0-50 for some rare transactions.  And so on - with the number of hundreds / tens taken depending on the maximum queues that occur. <br>  When reaching 299, issue the 100th number again. <br><br>  In this case, when they call the 110th number, and you have the 115th number, you know that there are 5 people ahead of you.  You are prepared for the name of your number - all the more you can already predict when they will call ‚Äúone hundred‚Äù that they want you. <br><br>  And when they call the 445 number, you automatically weed it out, without worrying about what your number will be called. <br><br>  Finishing it in software is very simple.  I wish you all good usable solutions.  :) <br><br>  <b>upd.</b>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/yaremko/" class="user_link">yaremko</a> also made a good offer: <br>  If we talk about the system of electronic queues, then for each type of operation there should be a ‚Äúwindow with numbers‚Äù where it is shown - the current one is in service and two following it for this operation. <br><br>  I will add that the numbers can be just sequential, and on the check print the "Window Number" in which you were put.  Above the window, you can simply print the subscriber number from 0 to 999. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/55705/">https://habr.com/ru/post/55705/</a></p>
