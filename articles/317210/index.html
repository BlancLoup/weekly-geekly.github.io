In which I rode a bike for half an hour, and then amazing things happened </h3><br>  This exciting story began in May.  I took the bike in the city rental, drove from the subway of 1905 to Arbat, parked and went to work.  And after 3 hours, I received a text message from the bank about writing off 1000 rubles, as if I was riding not half an hour, but three.  Apparently, at the time of parking an error occurred, and the station did not see the bike.  In support of Velobike, they explained to me that it was necessary to wait for a text message about the end of the rental, and refused to return the money.  I was offended and conceived a cruel (as I then thought) revenge. <br><br>  I wrote about this case <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/usedesk/blog/301052/">in our blog on customer service Usedesk.</a>  In the article, I sorted out the errors of support: I swore at the formal answers, bureaucratic approach, inflexible decisions and poor information about the conditions of hire.  Shared an article on Facebook, mentioned @ Velobike and waited. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  We and the team joked that scandalous fame would be caught up with bad service whistleblowers in the city bicycle rental, and what the hell was not joking - Velobike would react.  But they did not seriously count on any resonance.

      A day after the publication of the article, Velobike unexpectedly added a reminder to the SMS that he needed to wait for the SMS to end the rental. <br><br>  Two days later, my iPhone rang. <br><br>  <i>- Hello, Katerina, my name is Gleb, I am the general director of the Velobike company.</i> <br><br>  Fear desires, they tend to come true. <br><br><h3>  Chapter 2. In which we meet with the team Velobike and find out how everything is arranged from the inside </h3><br>  I thought I would be happy now that a thousand had already flown back to the map.  But the turn was steeper. <br><br><blockquote>  Gleb Narozhnykh, general director of Moscow city hire Velobike: <br><br>  The post was published in the Usedesk corporate blog and, in addition to the author‚Äôs emotions, contained quite clear recommendations in terms of customer service.  For our part, at this moment we faced a difficult choice of a system for working with customer requests and, quite naturally, after studying Usedesk‚Äôs company profile, we had a business proposal for them - try Usedesk and its capabilities for Velobike.  I scored Katerina. </blockquote><br>  A week later, we were sitting at the guys in the office on Berezhkovskaya Embankment, drinking coffee and figuring out how to improve support processes. <br><br><h3>  How is the support of Velobike </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e1b/772/a2b/e1b772a2b0f7482bb5607709d4f4f4c7.png"><br><br>  The call center receives calls and answers questions from metropolitan cyclists online about rental rates, card charges and even which side to park the bike.  Clients who do not like to talk on the phone write to info@velobike.ru or to the social network. <br><br>  If the situation is controversial, as happened to me - then the call center sends the application to the department of operators - write a letter by mail.  Operators check the details of the trip, compare the facts, agree with the financial department and make a verdict - to return the money or refuse.  If the customer has found an orphaned broken bike, the operators report this to the dispatcher, and the dispatcher sends the driver to repair the bike. <br><br>  The departments communicated among themselves through mail, Skype and even on paper.  As a result, some applications were lost, there was a lot of manual labor and little statistics.  It was necessary to streamline work in order to respond to customers faster and spend less time on routine operations.  Learn more about the problems and solutions found soon. <br><br><h3>  Chapter 3. We are starting the implementation of Yuzdeska </h3><br>  To begin with, I drew a large scheme of the process of work - how do letters arrive, how do operators set statuses and assign categories to requests, to whom claims are sent and how they respond to customers. <br><br> <a href="https://www.gliffy.com/go/publish/11437503"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bd3/4da/2d3/bd34da2d3ba74e069fe6f3fd724ed97b.png"></a> <br>  <i>Click on the picture to explore it.</i> <br><br>  The next step was to transfer this theoretical scheme to Judesk.  For this, we connected 2 mailboxes of the Velobike to Yuzdesk so that the letters would enter the program.  We created templates for answering frequently asked questions in order not to write manually every time.  For future statistics on the topic of appeals added category tags: <br><br><blockquote>  account blocked, free rental, thanks, refund held, troika card, consultation, bike found, payment failed, bike malfunction, item malfunction, bike stolen and 25 more tags. </blockquote><br>  It remains to train the operators.  I showed where to poke, which buttons to press in order to change statuses and reassign questions to colleagues.  At first, the guys resisted "what is this new program, unusual, inconvenient."  But an hour later, one operator said to another, "Yes, this new system is just mail, Skype and Excel in one."  And that was the best definition of Yuzdeska that I heard. <br><br>  Now all the letters fall into one tape.  I opened the program - I saw how many letters, on which topic, who was in charge, that required an immediate response. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eb2/1e3/725/eb21e3725c5b40989b9da2f60a35fff3.png"><br>  <i>Request list in Yuzdeska</i> <br><br><h3>  Chapter 4. From which it will be clear why there was something to introduce </h3><br>  It took 3 weeks from talking to coffee to the first requests in the system.  We stumbled upon a problem that greatly slowed down the speed of responses.  60% of letters came from call center employees from no-reply @ .ru <br>  in standard format. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/66c/055/a22/66c055a2270d43eda0c76db995980c20.png"><br>  <i>Call center letter</i> <br><br>  To reply to the client, you first had to find his e-mail in the Velobike database using the client's ID.  Then add an e-mail to Judesk and only after that answer.  Long awkward nightmare.  In two steps, we saved the staff extra 2 minutes on each letter: <br><br>  From the Velobike database, customers with e-mails were transferred to the Juzdeska database.  They created a rule that, by ID inside the letter, searches for a client in the database and substitutes the required client with the address in the card. <br><br>  ‚ÄúOh, now 100 times faster!‚Äù The operators rated. <br><br>  The pedals spun, and the work went faster) <br><br>  Here's what else we managed to adjust compared to the old work process. <br><br>  <b>Problem 1.</b> When customers wrote or called the call center several times, several employees were taken at the same time for the same problem.  There were incidents.  The persistent client, who disagreed with the cancellation of the rental, called the call center and, for loyalty, wrote twice in support.  The client was lucky - one of the operators decided in his favor and returned the money.  But the guys spent the time in which they could help two more clients. <br><br>  <b>As it became.</b>  Same customer requests are now merged.  Due to this, the whole history of interactions is preserved. <br><br>  The guys in the support take into account all the details and compare with the system the testimony of the client, before making a verdict.  It happens that a client writes in a claim that he did not know anything about rental rates.  But in fact, he called the call center and was warned how much money would be written if he didn‚Äôt park at the station, and tie the bike to the fence.  Check it out is easy.  What the client said, that different operators answered him - everything is in front of the eyes, and the puzzle pieces are not lost.  So unscrupulous cyclists bring to clean water.  But responsible and honest always meet. <br><br>  <b>Problem 2.</b> 22% of calls are related to payment and returns.  The final decision on the return of disputed charges is taken by the manager.  Previously, the application for approval of the operators passed to him ... on paper.  Each application was printed out, hoarded sheets and put on a table in a pack.  Something was lost, customers for a long time could not wait for the money and rightly resented. <br><br>  It reached 120 printed applications per day, the ballot boxes in the office were filled with paper. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/758/ba9/943/758ba9943c514ca9b21e1978d203e4cc.jpg"><br>  <i>Paper claim for return</i> <br><br>  <b>As it became.</b>  Cycle saves trees and saves paint in the printer.  No waste paper.  Reconciliations are held in Yuzdeska with internal comments.  The question is simply assigned to Sergey, and he sees the entire list of applications where reaction is needed.  All solution steps in one request. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9cf/417/a04/9cf417a0487c46ab8354fb8a3c7450fb.png"><br>  <i>Application for return in Yuzdeska</i> <br><br>  <b>Problem 4.</b> For statistics, information on each letter was manually entered into the ‚ÄúJournal of appeals‚Äù, an ordinary Excel file: the date and time, the topic of the appeal, the client, the responsible, the status and the term of the decision. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/536/fe2/6a2/536fe26a2aaa4e09994ce64c932d61ad.png"><br>  <i>Excel Magazine</i> <br><br>  This routine was time consuming.  Staying after the change to fill the file - the usual thing.  It used to be spent on this extra working day. <br><br>  Where there is manual labor, there are mistakes: they didn‚Äôt add the figure, that time was incorrectly indicated - everything, the statistics are already lying.  Therefore, it is useless. <br><br>  <b>As it became.</b>  Unnecessary gestures are minimized - nothing needs to be done, the system remembers all the statuses and those responsible.  Employees are focused on helping skiers and solving cycling problems.  At the same time, managers see statistics for reasons of appeals, speed of decision and control the process in one system. <br><br><h3>  Chapter 5. Velobike thinks up how to use Yuzdesk for proactive support </h3><br>  Having adjusted the process of questions and answers by mail, the Velobike support team went further.  Next in line were painful problems that caused customers and Velobike to lose money. <br><br>  <b>When the bike is not parked</b> <br><br>  The most common reason for unnecessary charges is an error in the lock at the time of parking.  A tired cyclist after skiing does not fully insert the bicycle into the lock, and the rental is not closed.  A couple of hours later, the client already receives a text message from the bank, that 450 rubles have been written off. <br><br>  There were many complaints, tears and lost money.  Therefore, in support of Velobike modernized the process.  Now, if an error occurred during parking, the client will be sent an SMS, and after that the operator will call: ‚ÄúI see you cannot park.‚Äù  Let's help! ‚Äù  Usually, the client does not have time to go far from the parking lot, he is asked to come back and make sure that the bike is delivered correctly. <br><br>  Like customer letters, parking error notifications come to operators in Youdesk, it often helps to react before the customer dials the support number. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4ef/1a3/4e8/4ef1a34e8aea4637a048f294758d9204.png"><br>  <i>Parking Error Notification</i> <br><br>  <b>When the rental was delayed for 6 hours</b> <br><br>  Another expensive problem is rentals longer than 6 hours.  It happens, the client decided to ride to the neighboring city and did not calculate the time and his strength.  Maybe he was late for work and did not find free slots at the station.  Or a novice did not understand how to return the bike to the parking lot.  In any case, if the rental lasts half a day, it means "something happened."  Probably not good.  As a result, a client may inadvertently lose 1,500 rubles, and Velobike a bicycle, which costs much more. <br><br>  Previously, support did not receive any signals about long runs.  Operators manually monitored bicycles that did not return to the parking lot for longer than 24 hours.  But finding a lost bike in a day was almost impossible. <br><br>  Therefore Velobike finalized the system and introduced alerts.  Now, if the rental lasts for more than 6 hours - the client is informed by SMS, and a notification is received to the operators in Youdesk.  Operators easily find a customer, contact him, and find out what happened.  If the client simply left the bike somewhere, then he will be asked to return to the nearest parking lot.  Follow the advice of support and treat the rental bike responsibly, as if it were your own - it‚Äôs profitable.  Velobike will meet to recount the cost of rental, considering how much the client actually drove.  That's what I understand - flexibly and conscientiously customer-oriented. <br><br>  From the beginning of the 2016 bike season, every 4th missing bike had an error when parking. <br><br>  After the introduction of alerts, bicycles that did not return on time became 2.5 times less.  For 3 months of working with alerts, only 1 bike was lost, and only because the client refused to park it at another station.  The remaining bikes are found and returned "home". <br><br><h3>  Chapter 6. Where we sum up </h3><br>  Moving from lyrics to numbers.  What was possible for the 2016 season. <br><table cellpadding="30"><tbody><tr><td></td><td>  July-September 2015 </td><td>  <b>July-September 2016</b> </td></tr><tr><td width="200">  Work with backdated calls (when a client has applied several times through different communication channels) </td><td width="200">  17% </td><td width="200">  <b>2%</b> </td></tr><tr><td>  Search for information on the client during the initial call (by the login or the name of the client, check for hits and view history) </td><td>  7 minutes </td><td>  <b>3 minutes</b> </td></tr><tr><td>  Time for technical response preparation (using standard answers and rules) </td><td>  4 minutes </td><td>  <b>1 minute ‚Üí</b> <b>4</b> <b>times</b> <b>faster</b> </td></tr><tr><td>  Response time to the client, taking into account the situation investigation </td><td>  12 h 12 min </td><td>  <b>2 h 22 min ‚Üí</b> <b>6</b> <b>times</b> <b>faster</b> </td></tr></tbody></table><br>  Operators are now contacting customers and warning about the timing of a solution to the problem, as a result, customers are aware that they are engaged in their issue and rarely call again.  Operators are not loaded with calls and respond to customers faster. <br><br><blockquote>  Sergey Tsygankov, Deputy  Head of Velobike client management: <br><br>  As a person who worked in the CPM systems, I understood all the pros and cons.  A rather important argument for their implementation is that all the moves are recorded and each employee bears personal responsibility.  Not an operator 1, 2, but personally, for example, Alexander Gromov, Sergey Tsygankov.  Due to the fact that everything is in sight and access is the management of the company, the use of Usedesk disciplines operators.  The system is reflected when the application hit the person, when he replied that he did for this, answered correctly.  I can go at any time to see what is happening in Yuzdesk, what appeals are in the works.  This tool allows you to improve the quality of our work in all channels of interaction with the client. <br></blockquote><br><h3>  What's next? </h3><br>  For the next cycling season, Velobike has plans to continue to expand the bike rental zone for the third ring, and to support regular customers with new convenient features in the mobile application.  And Yuzdesk plans to integrate with the mobile application and the database of Velobike customers and rentals in order to ‚Äúinvestigate‚Äù disputed cases even faster.  Together we will help Muscovites move around the city in a fun and comfortable way. <br><br>  It was an enlightening and rewarding experience.  Everything turned out, because the guys from Velobike turned out to be unchallenged, not indifferent and cool professionals.  And for me, this story is not even about customer service.  This is about how people come together to do useful work together. <br><br>  I personally thank Gleb - for the chance.  Farida and Sergey - for patience and kindness.  All Velobike - for what makes the city healthier, more mobile and happier.  Thanks for letting UseDesk be a part of it. <br><br>  See you in April :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/317210/">https://habr.com/ru/post/317210/</a></p>
