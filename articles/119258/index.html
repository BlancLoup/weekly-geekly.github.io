Yes, I understand that the likelihood of its implementation tends to zero because of the many problems in the Russian state, but this is no reason not to try to influence the potentially good undertaking of our officials?  After all, this is how the ‚Äúcivil society‚Äù about which many speak with gusto should manifest itself.  If we manage to come to some consensus on the issue under discussion, then we can try and tweet Medvedev on Twitter.  ‚ò∫ Well, or as an intermediate option, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/interviews/119228/">ask for</a> comment on the idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãIgor Shchyogolev.  How can the task be overridden with the task of writing your own version of the law ‚ÄúOn the national payment system‚Äù, which is not a real manifestation of crowdsourcing and a sign that society is ready to take legislative initiative?

      In case you have at least a drop of interest, welcome under cat. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, right to the point, the main sentences: <br><ul><li>  Creation of an EIS system (Electronic Identifier of the Subject), which is a smart card (or similar technical devices) and the corresponding infrastructure for their work.  Cards will have to serve as a universal and legally valid confirmation of the authenticity of a subject (natural and legal person, administrative unit), as well as allow signing electronic documents using EDS </li><li>  The EIS smart card should allow embedding additional functions based on the principle of modules through recording into an EPROM (electronically erasable programmable permanent memory), for example, to act as payment and social cards, as well as be used in public services and e-government. </li><li>  Creation of a National Payment System (NPS) based on the Bank of Russia with zero cost of operations, implemented by default in an EIS, financed exclusively by the state, created using foreign experience and technology </li><li>  Transfer of all state budget operations to PS </li><li>  Gradual introduction of mandatory electronic reporting for all budget operations signed using EIS </li><li>  Publication of statements in full in open access (with the exception of information constituting state or commercial secrets, for example, the amount of taxes paid by a separate company) </li></ul><br>  And now a little flood, explaining why this is so and not otherwise. <br><br><h4>  Electronic Subject Identifier (EIS) </h4><br>  Why EIS, and not UEC (universal electronic card)?  Because, in my opinion, it is necessary to initially create a system applicable at all levels, ranging from ordinary people to companies and budget organizations operating in Russia.  Since financial transactions and public services will be tied to this identifier, it would be foolish to limit it to physical.  by individuals.  Those.  EIS will be available for each established company and budget organization. <br><br>  But what will these organizations do with this smart card, you ask?  The fact of the matter is that the smart card is completely optional, because the EIS is, in fact, an entry in the database, and the smart card is only the key to it.  Therefore, as a key, no one bothers to use, for example, widespread flash keys.  Of course, it is best to use time-tested e-signature as a user ID, since the legal basis for this has already been created. <br><br>  At the moment, a smart card (we will talk about it for definiteness) EIS can only sign documents with the help of EDS, but this <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/pay_sistem/109811/">will not go far</a> .  We also need banking operations, social services, and, in the end, slipping public services.  The benefit of a smart card is quite clever things (the name requires), for this is the second item.  If I'm not mistaken, this way we will be able to kill several birds with one stone.  In addition, the issue of international payment systems (ICS) will be resolved, now if you want to go abroad you will simply transfer your money to their account, and the account itself will already be tied to your card.  In theory, such a system will allow the EIS to interact with the already existing infrastructure of ATMs and POS-terminals.  (correct me if smart cards don't allow this) <br><br>  Because  wide use of such a system is impossible without an open API, then, in theory, EIS elements can be embedded in any technical devices, such as mobile phones and communicators.  For example, <a href="http://corporate.visa.com/media-center/media-kits/visa-innovation-vision.shtml">the</a> Visa <a href="http://corporate.visa.com/media-center/media-kits/visa-innovation-vision.shtml">initiative</a> can fit in perfectly well. <br><br><h4>  National payment system. </h4><br>  Why create your own payment system with go and geisha, if we will be able to use proven IPS using a card, you ask?  But, despite the almost universal disapproval, I consider the creation of an NPS, certainly, to be a good and strategically important business for our country.  And here it‚Äôs not only in the notorious ‚Äúsecurity‚Äù (remembering 1998 and blocking the IPU), but also in creating a favorable financial infrastructure that will not only allow the state to be calm for its finances, but also provide a favorable impetus for business development .  (forget for a moment about the sad "they wanted to do better - it turned out as always") <br><br>  In my opinion, it is not worth letting private owners into its creation, but to take a chance and get back to basics by creating a free and unhindered financial structure provided and supported by the state.  (we recall the history of the formation of money, and the period when the state acted as the actual guarantor of the sample of the metal of the coin) It would be reasonable to entrust financial management to the Bank of Russia.  The zero cost of operations will not only make the system actively used, but in the long term will serve as the basis for Russia's high-tech financial infrastructure.  Thus, the system will be serviced exclusively at the expense of the state, I believe that this is normal, because in this form it is not just a payment system, but the financial infrastructure of the State, which means it should build and maintain it.  Given the above, the operator of the NPS should be able to act any subject.  Those.  roughly speaking, we will be able to transfer our funds ourselves without the participation of intermediaries, and here and before working with finance with Internet services is not far away, and quite legally and securely.  (remembers many stories related to WebMoney and Yandex.Money) <br><br>  Further, it is necessary to clearly distinguish between NPS and EIS.  A personal account, of course, is tied to an EIS, but one should not forget that different systems are not to be confused.  So, the fact that any person can act as an NPC operator is absolutely no threat to personal data.  It follows that it is possible to open an account in an NPS without an EIS. <br><br><h4>  Budget and NPS usage </h4><br>  And now dessert, which is unlikely to be happy to the Treasury, the Federal Tax Service, as well as many Russian officials.  The gradual transfer of budget operations (tax collection, distribution, expenditure) on the NPS with electronic reporting. <br><br>  With the transfer to the NPC, I think this is quite a logical step and there shouldn't be any questions here, but what about the reporting?  In my opinion, it should look like this.  Remember that using EIS can identify companies and budget organizations?  Accordingly, each administrative unit will have its EIS.  Further, during the payment of taxes, and this is just a transfer of funds from the company's account to the NPS, tied to the EIS to the account of the organization collecting taxes to the NPCs already signed by their EIS, each company sends an electronic report signed by its EDS using the EIS, then all the funds go up (and each operation is again accompanied by a report signed by the EIS).  As a result, a budget is formed.  Then it is distributed to the lower ranks, and again a report will be sent to each operation in the common base.  Those.  as a result, the authorities will have the opportunity to trace the path of each ruble from tax to official spending on the spot, which, accordingly, will make the budgetary authorities transparent for the controlling authorities.  In addition, each report must contain a legislative act (or a link to it) according to which this operation takes place.  Those.  misuse will be seen a mile away. <br><br>  And now the most desirable, but unfortunately the least attainable, publication of reports in open access.  Ideally, all reports are laid out in open access, of course, except for data on expenditures that constitute state secrets, and, for example, on taxes paid by an individual company or person.  Using these data, the public will be able to quickly enough draw the attention of regulatory authorities to misuse or misappropriation of funds, given that each report is accompanied by a legislative act on which it passes, and it will be very easy to recognize the legality.  But in a situation if they steal ‚Äúaccording to the law‚Äù, then, there‚Äôs no way to go, all that remains is to kick the legislators. <br><br>  Important note, in no case is it proposed to introduce this system at once and for everyone, it is simply impossible, because it requires not only any electronic document management system, but also people who are not afraid of working with ‚ÄúShaitan-machines‚Äù, but as we know, officials are very nosy people ... <br><br>  So, such a system is possible and should be promoted gradually, from top to bottom, i.e.  roughly speaking, the ministry is reporting today (and such reports can be found now if desired), and after a year or two, the ministry and further down to the bitter end. <br><br><h4>  How to do? </h4><br>  Now a little about how to build this utopia.  With the naked eye it is clear that the system is a very high-tech and large-scale project, therefore, in my opinion it is advisable to create a state decentralized information system, so to say, ‚ÄúNational Cloud‚Äù, it will work not only with the EIS and the NPS, but also all public services and sites, i.e.  a situation when each department has its own hosting, and it‚Äôs unclear what quality it should sink into oblivion.  The creation of such an information infrastructure could serve as an excellent proof that what we have about ‚Äúinnovation‚Äù and ‚Äúmodernization‚Äù can not only scratch the language, but also do the job.  Well, of course, without the use of foreign technologies (which means their buying) is not enough.  You also should not forget the mandatory certification in the FSB, the process is unpleasant, but vital. <br><br>  The fact that the state structures will use the NPS should have a positive impact on its quality, because unlike our roads, each ‚Äúhole‚Äù will hit the structures most strongly, because  officials will use the system as often as ordinary people with companies.  In addition, the introduction of such a system will trigger the penetration of the Internet in all parts of our country, because without it, it will not be possible to carry out normal management and work in the field. <br><br><h4>  Security </h4><br>  Given the importance of the system, of course the implementation should be as secure as possible.  And the matter is not only in cryptography and similar issues of reliability, but also in systems of protection against so-called.  ‚ÄúIdentity theft‚Äù and leakage of personal data. <br><br>  Because  I am not a professional in this field, I cannot specifically and clearly describe the protection system.  But I think that, at a minimum, mechanisms should be provided for the quickest possible cancellation of smart cards, and it should also be possible to ‚Äúlay eggs in different baskets,‚Äù that is,  If desired, the holder of the EIS can order several cards, for example, one will only have an EDS and a different bank account.  The benefit of all this is connected by modules and technically there should be no difficulties. <br><br><h4>  And who needs it? </h4><br>  The state needs a system for understandable reasons, it‚Äôs not only a desire to boast of ‚Äúmodernization‚Äù before the people and foreign partners, but also quite understandable incentives for business development and attracting investments to the economy.  In addition, the fact of the fight against the misuse of funds, one of the most important problems of the state apparatus, is also important.  (in other words, to make it so that they wouldn‚Äôt steal too much downstairs) Moreover, the authorities will literally have a large part of the financial system in their hands, so they can easily monitor and prevent a huge percentage of financial crimes.  In addition, the costs of servicing budget flows and the associated paperwork will be reduced.  Plus, financial transactions, such as currency issues and tax collections, will be significantly simplified. <br><br>  Companies will get a convenient tool for working with finances, available immediately after their registration.  As well as the ability to significantly reduce the costs of accounting, for example, what is called "pay taxes in one click."  (i.e., in fact, for small enterprises, the need for an accountant as such will be eliminated) With proper implementation, the system will allow online trading and cashless payments to flourish. <br><br>  For citizens, this is primarily a convenient card through which you can do a lot (payment of taxes, utilities, military ID, medical card, education, passport, EDS, insurance, etc.), while avoiding standing in endless lines .  In the second, it is an opportunity to see with your own eyes how their taxes are spent. <br><br>  In addition, there are many related benefits, ranging from the development of the Internet and ideally ending with a reduction in the bureaucracy. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  And at the end of the proposal to people involved in creating ‚Äútheir i-gorod‚Äù, why don't you try to create a prototype of the budget reporting system described above?  Those.  for example, on the basis of XML to make an OpenSource project for generating, storing, signing and viewing reports, automatically sending money when sending a report, and of a graphical interface to it for studying financial flows.  Such a software package would not only be ‚Äúwe, too, can, and even better, and even without cuts,‚Äù but would be quite useful in quite earthly matters. <br><br>  That's basically it.  Constructive criticism on the substance of the issue is very welcome, especially for people working with the technologies mentioned, because  I was not an expert could make technical errors.  (although I tried to study the topic to the best of my abilities) Yes, and the article itself does not claim to be complete, this is only a suggestion to the community to discuss the project from different sides, i.e.  "Sit down and help." <br><br>  <b>And once again, just in case, whining ‚Äúnobody needs it,‚Äù ‚Äúthey don‚Äôt introduce‚Äù, ‚Äúcut it all‚Äù, please leave it aside, I understand everything, that's why I wrote that the project is ‚Äúutopian‚Äù, the task of trying to discuss is not how it will be and what the system should look like.</b> <br><br>  PS: An article some time ago was in a sandbox and published here at the request of its author. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/119258/">https://habr.com/ru/post/119258/</a></p>
