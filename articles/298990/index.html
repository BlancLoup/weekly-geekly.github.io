  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The first acquaintance with SendPulse</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good time of day, dear followers and dear readers! <br>  I decided to share with you my personal impressions of an interesting mass mailing service, which I myself had learned quite recently. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/637/c22/9a0/637c229a01b443f381d5589d92ec6104.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Let's first determine why we really need such services?  The root cause is the desire to interact with the client, both present and potential: to keep him informed of all updates related to any changes in the business;  notify on promotions, discounts;  congratulate him on public or private holidays, and much more.  So, it is precisely for this kind of interaction that there are mass mailing services that allow you to communicate with the client using pre-assembled databases.  One of these services is SendPulse. <br>  How does SendPulse differ from other services?  SendPulse is a platform that combines the capabilities of e-mail newsletters, SMS, push notifications and transactional emails.  When choosing a service for your needs, the first thing SendPulse offers is to send a free e-mail list to your contact database to prove its effectiveness.  The next positive thing is the presence of a free tariff: if your database contains less than 2500 contacts, then 15,000 emails per month are absolutely free for you. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/89e/70d/e3b/89e70de3b0084ec899e9d9df607ef78a.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Let's consider also the possibilities of e-mail newsletters that SendPulse offers to its users.  The first thing that catches your eye is that the service has a very successfully implemented template builder that allows you to create recognizable letter templates without HTML skills, and without much effort. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7d2/3c0/cb9/7d23c0cb93664aa3b50d0f5507de180e.png" alt="image"><br>  Even if the designer does not give you the opportunity to realize your vision for the design of the letter, you can easily contact the designer SendPulse, who, thanks to his experience, will be able to realize your most sophisticated ideas.  Also in the same template designer there is an opportunity to create a responsive letter design, which is a very important point, considering how deeply various mobile gadgets have penetrated into our lives.  The next point that I would like to highlight among SendPulse features is the ability to intelligently personalize the mailing, allowing you to send different emails within the same mailing.  Such personalization allows you to get even closer to your customers, because each of us is more pleasant to receive a personal letter than a mass mailing. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ffa/c6b/fc8/ffac6bfc84af48c59ad0e3c8acbcc033.png" alt="image"><br>  Separately, I would like to highlight the technical support service.  They answer fairly quickly and, apparently, they really work 24/7. <br>  Also SendPulse allows you to receive a detailed report on each e-mail of the company, which makes it possible to analyze the effectiveness of each mailing. <br>  Well, the last thing I would like to highlight is the special feature of SendPulse called white label.  By activating this feature, any mention of the service disappears completely in the mailings, which is a very useful feature if you have your own recognizable brand. <br>  As they say, fewer words - more action.  Try it yourself, at least in test mode, use SendPulse for your mailings, and draw your own conclusions about this service.  As for me, I was pleased with what I saw. </div>
