On the last day of his departure, he found himself in a completely magical place called the Astronomical Observatory of Kazan University.  V.P.  Engelhardt  A place where nature, science and popularization are combined in perfect shape. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e63/25b/305/e6325b30577676db1cf4ed4828965b48.jpg"><br><br>  The Observatory opened in 1901 and was created at the initiative of the astronomer of the Kazan University Dmitry Ivanovich Dubyago.  A representative of a simple Russian noble family, Engelhardt, provided funding for the construction of all observatory buildings and scientific equipment.  Vasily Pavlovich Engelhardt was also an astronomer, although now he would be called an amateur, as the West says backyard astronomer - an astronomer in the backyard.  In the 1890s, for health reasons, he realized that he could no longer do astronomy and transferred all his equipment ‚Äúfrom the backyard‚Äù to Kazan University.  Based on this, near Kazan, it was possible to build an ultra-modern, at that time, observatory.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/515/b8e/eab/515b8eeabacaf4f176301cdb56fe0fdb.jpg"><br><br>  Once, while in his Dresden villa, Engelhardt realized that his checkbook and noble title would not be useful at the gates of paradise, and he decided to devote all the accumulated funds to a godly business - the construction of a modern scientific center for studying the secrets of the Universe.  Considering what time it was then, the decision turned out to be extremely far-sighted, how many Russian noblemen could bring their German surname through Russia in the 20th century and even leave it on the Moon?  This is a word about long-term investments ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/dff/198/6e8/dff1986e86f76a9cd0151982a3d6d955.jpg"><br><br>  Charming employees of the Republican Center for Popularization of Youth Science <a href="https://vk.com/scienceartlab">Science Art Lab</a> at the Academy of Sciences of the Republic of Tatarstan helped me to get to the observatory.  I was struck by the very existence of such a center.  At the Russian Academy of Sciences there are no centers of science popularization at all, and at the Academy of Sciences of the Republic of Tatarstan there are no youth centers.  The center was founded on the initiative of <a href="https://vk.com/buona_forchetta">Aliya Hamidullina</a> , who is now its head.  The center organizes Sciense Slam Kazan, organizes lectures, discussion and creative clubs, and sometimes meets visiting spacebloggers. <br><br>  In the observatory we were met by no less remarkable women-keepers of the scientific staff of the observatory. <br><br>  I don‚Äôt know that they talked to me about it, but they accepted me as a dear guest, they all showed me, they answered all the questions.  Of course, any blogger is valuable for his readers, so such a warm welcome actually was not for me, but for you.  I just share what I heard and saw. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/33e/8a8/b72/33e8a8b72ce7253896fa13ad9ee7685a.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6df/b5b/cbb/6dfb5bcbb191e9e64b69242c25de629e.jpg"><br><br>  The Observatory now operates as a scientific, educational and popular science center.  On the territory there is one modernized robot telescope AZT-14, although the main scientific activities of specialists are carried out with the help of a remote telescope in the mountains of the Caucasus.  As it turned out, I took it off when I was in the winter on the <a href="http://zelenyikot.com/bta/">way to SAO RAS</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2fb/567/ab1/2fb567ab1cb9579e96208872553cd432.jpg"><br><br>  The ancient telescopes of the Engelhard Observatory retain full functionality, but now they act as museum exhibits and teaching equipment for students and schoolchildren. <br><br>  At the central building of the observatory a model of an <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2590%25D1%2580%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BB%25D1%258F%25D1%2580%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D1%2581%25D1%2584%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0">armillary sphere is</a> installed, for visual representation of the meridians of the planet.  Nearby is a strip symbolizing the meridian.  Researcher Margarita Ivanovna Kibardina shows how the meridian runs, and tells the legend that stepping over the white strip contributes to the fulfillment of desires. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2d8/e1d/858/2d8e1d8584aa6387fc50b6829a8c263e.jpg"><br><br>  Legend invented to attract tourists.  And working.  Not in the sense of execution, but in the sense of attraction. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7df/1c6/602/7df1c660288817f0ebe52c201ab0bc23.jpg"><br><br>  In the distance one can see a small chapel - the tomb of the founder of the observatory, DI Dubyago.  Subsequently, Engelhardt was reburied here just a few years ago, having fulfilled, a century later, his will.  The mound and the chapel simultaneously perform an applied task: there is a window in its wall in which the light burns.  This light source mimics a star and was previously used to adjust the meridian telescope, which is hidden under a corrugated iron roof.  We will get to it yet. <br><br>  For now we come to a more modern exhibit - the sundial. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/714/b7d/ac5/714b7dac587e245d28aecca72a0c20bf.jpg"><br><br>  The granddaughter of the founder of the observatory Inga Dubyago explains the difference between the time on our watch and true solar time and shows the formulas for calculating one of the other with the help of a sundial. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/67d/d4e/565/67dd4e56594b07d06d3d7796d807eb28.jpg"><br><br>  For Kazan, this is relevant.  They live in Moscow time, although the real astronomical time is significantly different, therefore in Kazan there are always the earliest sunrises. <br><br>  The observatory has been preserved in excellent condition since the time of construction.  Even looking at the door of the central building, you can see that a century of history has added only one lock. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ca8/723/9ad/ca87239ad7a735c5cbba931cdaf6aef1.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/523/8ef/9fe/5238ef9fe3e4a38e2442ea92171e0d26.jpg"><br><br>  The architecture of the building in many ways resembles the temple, which is not surprising, given that in the time free from the design of observatories the architect of the building created churches and temples of Kazan. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bff/10b/40a/bff10b40a6b7cd088c847f9054b9cebc.jpg"><br><br>  A memorial tablet of space toponyms reminds of the world recognition of the achievements of Kazan astronomers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/73a/d92/811/73ad92811b10ae9fe45ee33b161383f4.jpg"><br><br>  In a small showroom, the observatory staff collected several historical and modern astronomical instruments. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ad1/69e/809/ad169e8099738cb5340916612abb980e.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/aac/e60/052/aace60052f1b4cabdaf25d2fdf1b9441.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/979/f3c/ab0/979f3cab0bdc4f03e7bd66579622b6d2.jpg"><br><br>  Warning labels scare away curious schoolchildren, who just let them touch everything. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/587/612/445/587612445cfc2846f4eb89b58a22ffb2.jpg"><br><br>  A small corner set aside astronautics.  At the stand you can see the star sphere, which was developed by the staff of the observatory for training astronauts so that they can navigate by the stars during the flight. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/583/321/f22/583321f22c34c56d8ec49cc9ddbc0c28.jpg"><br><br>  In the scientific activities of the observatory, much attention is paid to the moon. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1a7/e40/9c5/1a7e409c5519a02610b9bf222629abab.jpg"><br><br>  We move to the next block and after climbing the steep stairs we find ourselves under the dome of the largest 12-inch equatorial telescope in the observatory. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ba0/55a/e9b/ba055ae9b2fc6371446822a6ecb95f20.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/342/81c/539/34281c5392c72f35cc059a345403aa37.jpg"><br><br>  Nearby is also historical equipment, although not so ancient. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1b2/174/12c/1b217412ccc95d27e5690b6e3b0b6c53.jpg"><br><br>  The main rarity is a telescope. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/57d/95e/e27/57d95ee27bfbbcd5d9bd30f59fd98e65.jpg"><br><br>  From the balcony of the dome - a beautiful view of the surrounding nature. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ef9/6c1/85b/ef96c185ba97a4c50e8c1952a0a33916.jpg"><br><br>  And a planetarium in the distance. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1b4/dfb/27a/1b4dfb27ab84ee8fd7b79c9bd5f46a63.jpg"><br><br>  We descend the stairs, and proceed to the other wing of the building - to the meridian telescope. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/386/33f/923/38633f923b90ee97324949925bf10ffa.jpg"><br><br>  From a distance, this building looks like a cheap fake from the corrugation, but in fact it is also the historical part of the building.  A hundred years ago, she was a high-tech, created with the latest technology, both outside and inside. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fa2/3d9/8ec/fa23d98ecf53fc3ad3f2bc34d8b92356.jpg"><br><br>  I had already seen the meridian telescopes on an excursion at the Pulkovo Observatory, where they also looked very solid.  Once they were the most accurate instruments for astrometry - determining and tracking the exact position of stars.  This required strict calibration of the product and its orientation along the meridians of the planet, from there both its name and the need for an artificial star that shines in the tomb wall. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/468/4d6/982/4684d6982c134531c6cfe9cbe3c8b68e.jpg"><br><br>  There are divisions on the telescope wheel, which can only be viewed with a microscope, so this is practically nanotechnology 150 years ago.  (They are not in the photo). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/112/454/6a3/1124546a388218d4e4b7ca1bdd8e8943.jpg"><br><br>  Astrometry is required to study the motion of a star in galactic space and to measure distance using parallax.  The measurement requires the most accurate, since the motion of most stars is almost imperceptible and requires long-term systematic observations. <br><br>  In addition, astronomers of the twentieth century for a long time tried to <a href="http://zelenyikot.com/exoplanet-search/">detect exoplanets</a> using astrometry methods, but failed in this.  But with more massive systems of double stars, it worked out more efficiently. <br><br>  We again demonstrate the excellent functionality of centenarian devices.  Inga Alexandrovna, with the help of a polyspast mechanism, in several movements alone reveals the dome of the telescope. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/130/130/74b/13013074b2a82dc163d16bf4ec48f346.jpg"><br><br>  Nearby is the original barometer, to determine the climatic conditions of work. <br><br>  Try to guess why this working chair has such a strange construction :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c4a/295/08a/c4a29508afcb1619dd332d501879c1c7.jpg"><br><br>  We leave again in bright sunlight.  Nearby is the dome of a telescope-heliometer, for observing the sun.  A small cabinet, similar to a beehive, is a support for amateur telescopes, which students themselves sometimes bring to night observations. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/49a/c15/59f/49ac1559f1a20b6671ffdb5021c7c063.jpg"><br><br>  But we are moving to another dome - a little more.  A photographic mirror telescope of the Maksutov system, AST-452, is installed here.  This is a Soviet development, established in 1963. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/530/6a0/702/5306a0702a309280b9f4b475422d6ca2.jpg"><br><br>  It is impossible to look into the telescope itself - it is equipped for shooting on photographic plates.  But you can look at the two viewfinders. <br><br>  At first, only trees are visible. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e88/798/9ae/e887989ae22d2e37bc01518b04aff0de.jpg"><br><br>  We were lucky to see the moon in the sky far enough from the sun to look at it safely. <br><br>  We take aim. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b18/c7c/858/b18c7c8587917fa7314871318923a4e0.jpg"><br><br>  Visible. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5f9/6fb/7f2/5f96fb7f246aca4f1563d63efcd07dc7.jpg"><br><br>  Of course, it would not hurt to clean the optics, but if you try, you can distinguish the details of the surface.  This does not affect the quality of the images of the telescope, since it shoots another, and this one only allows you to direct the subject. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3b1/977/2c6/3b19772c615df31126e362cfc69b6aa1.jpg"><br><br>  Walking through the territory of the observatory you can find several columns with fencing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5a8/90e/fd3/5a890efd38c7444584ae86924a4c5539.jpg"><br><br>  They resemble graves, but in reality these are also scientific instruments necessary for calibrating and improving the accuracy of the GLONASS system. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ff1/3b3/abe/ff13b3abe60fa3d514d74e64320be4f3.jpg"><br><br>  A little apart from the observatory buildings, the modern <a href="http://planetarium-kazan.ru/">Kazan Planetarium was</a> recently erected.  His visit is usually carried out separately from excursions to the observatory and here the flow of visitors is higher. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8d2/418/c2e/8d2418c2efc1031e61038bb64ed9a680.jpg"><br><br>  When you step over the threshold of the planetarium, there is a sharp change of environment.  From the snow-white domes of historic instruments, from blooming chamomiles and buzzing bees, you are dramatically transferred to the atmosphere of the modern high-tech. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f3d/3aa/c46/f3d3aac462d14c7dfe948cd2c3e77211.jpg"><br><br>  With robots. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/52f/0dc/3e8/52f0dc3e815b91e51f8a1f6719c07eb1.jpg"><br><br>  Plasma. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/88d/f87/05a/88df8705a2b05c254adb16797fe5d93e.jpg"><br><br>  3D printing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/55a/ffa/0ee/55affa0eeee1a0cb90d03847e2a21135.jpg"><br><br>  Rockets. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e0e/679/34e/e0e67934e8d1e32599e66e744ea285ab.jpg"><br><br>  And the lunar soil. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2ab/6fe/a89/2ab6fea89ef12978174995eec68f6484.jpg"><br><br>  I did not get to the screening of the film under the dome, but there was no time to wait, but I think everything is also at a high level there.  The emergence of such a high-tech planetarium outside the city was largely due to the efforts of the staff of the observatory.  They understand that the scientific significance of the observatory falls due to obsolescence of technology and because of the growth of the megalopolis that illuminates the sky.  Therefore, science is placed on remote telescopes in a more suitable astroclimate, and in the observatory it is necessary to develop its cultural and educational potential.  A similar problem now exists in Pulkovo near St. Petersburg, but there they <a href="http://topdialog.ru/2016/04/20/prezumpciya-vinovnosti-zastrojshhika-pulkovskaya-observatoriya-boretsya-protiv-samostroya/">are</a> only <a href="http://topdialog.ru/2016/04/20/prezumpciya-vinovnosti-zastrojshhika-pulkovskaya-observatoriya-boretsya-protiv-samostroya/">suing developers</a> , changing management and arguing when discussing <a href="http://www.fontanka.ru/2016/05/16/044/">comprehensive development plans</a> . <br><br>  Kazan astronomers turned out to be more reasonable.  They prepared a draft planetarium, wrote letters to officials and big businessmen, university graduates, offering to support the construction.  And, such perseverance was evaluated, the planetarium was built and opened three years ago. <br><br> <a href="https://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/143523/35246952.2/0_19d413_5f32ad5a_orig"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e81/69a/5cc/e8169a5cc40e78d76e5dfe47892175f1.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Such an approach can only be appreciated from the positive side by both researchers and the KFU university and the republican leadership.  Similarly, the Republican Center for Popularization of Youth Science appeared - an initiative from below, support from above ‚Äî a universal recipe for the development of the region and the country as a whole. <br><br>  The only problem with the Engelhardt Observatory is transport accessibility.  Twenty kilometers from the city is a serious obstacle to the constant flow of thirsting stars.  Last year, only 5 thousand visitors to the observatory and 25 thousand planetarium.  Flights of electric trains have been reduced, and suburban buses so far bypass the observatory side.  By taxi to get out 500 p.  one way.  But taxi drivers do not ask again ‚Äúwhere is it?‚Äù When you say ‚Äúto the observatory‚Äù. <br><br>  So, if you are in Kazan, do not deny yourself the opportunity to be in this place.  In addition to excursions, here conduct popular science lectures, evening and night observations. <br>  Excursion cost: <br>  Observatory: 50-300 r. <br>  Planetarium: 300-400 p.  depending on the program. <br><br>  I also recommend the <a href="http://zelenyikot.com/kazanspace/">Museum of Natural History of Tatarstan and the House of Science and Technology of Kazan</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/395611/">https://habr.com/ru/post/395611/</a></p>
