  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Classification of IT-users according to Pew</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A study of the Pew Internet Project revealed that almost all adult Americans (85%) use the Internet or mobile phones.  A large number of citizens have digital cameras and game consoles, not to mention broadband access to the Internet.  Despite all this, the share of those who use high-tech for self-expression, creativity and interactive communication is amazingly small - only eight percent.  These are the so-called ‚Äúomnivorous‚Äù techno-elite, which is much higher on the techno-social ladder than teenagers obsessed with cell phones (5th tier of the technosocial ladder) or veterans of the Internet (3rd tier). <br><br>  Absolutely all people can be quite accurately divided into ten types, depending on their attitude to gadgets, the Internet and social web services. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Let's start from the bottom up, that is, from the least advanced users.  This group includes 49% of Americans who practically do not use modern technology. <br><br>  <b>Off the Net</b> (15%).  These people do not have mobile phones or Internet access.  These are mostly older people who live their lives and do not want to change their lifestyle.

      <b>Indifferent</b> (11%).  Despite the presence of a mobile phone or Internet access, they only periodically use IT and find these technologies annoying. <br><br>  <b>Poorly involved, but satisfied</b> (15%).  The same as in the previous paragraph - they use IT very rarely, but, unlike the indifferent, they still like the technology. <br><br>  <b>Inexperienced experimenters</b> (8%).  They rarely use IT and have good potential, but for some reason they don‚Äôt have the time or desire to increase their experience, although there are all the possibilities for this. <br><br>  The second group - users who can not be called new or inexperienced.  This is the "golden mean." <br><br>  <b>Connected with voltage</b> (10%).  They do not spare money for modern technologies, but still can not overcome the internal disgust, to fall in love with high-tech with all my heart.  They suffer from information congestion and consider annoying constant availability for communication. <br><br>  <b>Crazy on mobiles</b> (10%).  Completely familiar with the functionality of mobile phones, these people do not often use the Internet, although they really like online technology. <br><br>  The third group is a techno-elite in which four types of users are distinguished. <br><br>  <b>Productivity boosters</b> (8%).  They are extremely positive about how modern technologies improve labor productivity, the effectiveness of communication with colleagues, the speed of learning new things. <br><br>  <b>Tired veterans</b> (8%).  They use the Internet very often and for a long time, but they like mobile phones much less.  Their admiration for high-tech remained in the past (if it ever existed).  They are not fans of modern communication technologies (blogs, IM, twitter, etc.). <br><br>  <b>Connectors</b> (7%).  With modern and functional models of mobile phones and the frequent use of the Internet, these people use the full technological potential to be in touch with other people and to manage digital content.  They are extremely pleased with the opportunities that are opening up thanks to high technology.  Their lifestyle, style of communication, and hobby are connected with high tech. <br><br>  <b>Omnivores</b> (8%).  Omnivores - the top of the technoelite.  These people use the most advanced mobile devices and the most advanced online services.  They actively participate in the life of online communities and Web 2.0 services where they find self-expression. <br><br>  A little bit more in detail about the "omnivorous."  Sociologists who have studied this type of user argue that such a person is easy to find out: he can watch videos on his iPod'e or lively discuss the ups and downs of an online game with another.  Most likely, this discussion will be through IM, by SMS or in a personal blog. <br><br>  Omnivores are big fans of Web 2.0, they love to test new technologies, between blogging and personal online affairs they take part in online communities.  They are extremely confident in their ability to manage large streams of information.  Moreover, they like it. <br><br>  Although the ‚Äúomnivorous‚Äù techno-elite watch TV less than average users, its representatives are obsessed with video technology: for example, they have three times the average digital video recorders (47% vs. 18%), they are much more likely to shoot video (58% against 22%) and have a video mobile (39% vs. 13%). <br><br>  As can be seen on the graph, omnivorous techno-elite (omnivores) publishes at least one of the six types of user content (UGC) much more often than usual. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/2fc/447/389/2fc4473896dd951e242482e02630aebe.jpg" width="450" height="239" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  They are much more likely to publish their photos and videos on the Internet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/9ce/6c9/1f6/9ce6c91f66c8d31d25c3211079ddb2ca.jpg" width="450" height="241" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  Technoelite cream makes up only 8% of the population.  These are predominantly males (70%) with a median age of 28 years, almost every second of them is a student or a schoolboy. <br><br>  via <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/press_release.asp%3Fr%3D140">Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project</a> ( <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/pdfs/PIP_ICT_Typology.pdf">PDF</a> ) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/8038/">https://habr.com/ru/post/8038/</a></p>
