November will delight us at once with two loud releases - the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One - with prefixes that everyone has been waiting for, and some even order.  However, it's really time for this, because if you do not pre-order now, there is a very high probability that you can remain without your long-awaited console at the exit, and continue to count the weeks before you can still buy it. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Finding out - which prefix is ‚Äã‚Äãmore interesting, which one is worth buying, and which one is not - is a pretty useless thing, especially considering that its leader, ‚Äúordering‚Äù music, has already been outlined in this race.  And it is absolutely objective: <br><br><ol><li>  PlayStation 4 is $ 100 cheaper than the Box. </li><li>  PlayStation 4, obviously, will get more interesting exclusives. </li><li>  PlayStation 4 determines what the consoles will be like, and cuts the stupid Microsoft ideas at the root, forcing them to change their policies regarding constant network connectivity, regional blocking and linking games to the account.  <a href="http://www.gametrailers.com/side-mission/54954/confirmed-microsoft-reverses-xbox-one-drm-policies">Proof</a> </li><li>  And finally, the last - after the presentation of the new Xbox, Sony‚Äôs shares rose in price by 9.25% - this also gives certain hints from the independent side of the public. </li></ol><br>  That is why we have prepared for you a complete instruction for the PlayStation 4 from Amazon to Russia, Ukraine and other CIS countries.  Here you will find information on how to do it better and what else to order along with the console, because you can save on the purchase, more than 5,000 rubles.  Also, we will write down all the prices for delivery, insurance and additional materials, so that habrovchane understand how much the new PS4 really costs them.

      <b>Prices for Sony PlayStation 4 in the world:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  By tradition, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CMQTVQO/ref%3Das_li_ss_tl%3Fie%3DUTF8%26camp%3D1789%26creative%3D390957%26creativeASIN%3DB00CMQTVQO%26linkCode%3Das2%26tag%3Dqwintrycom-20">pre-order a PlayStation 4 is the</a> cheapest in the US - here the console costs $ 399 </li><li>  Again, according to tradition, the price of electronics in Europe duplicates the US, only now in euros: 399 euros ~ $ 520 </li><li>  In Britain, the new console will cost a little more expensive: 349 pounds ~ $ 525 </li><li>  And, of course, the champion is Russia: $ 555 at the start of sales </li></ul><br>  Obviously, if it is possible to order a PlayStation 4 from the USA, it is better to do this, especially given the lack of regional blocking and a greater likelihood that the PS4 power supply will have double voltage.  Also, Amazon itself is happy, which, in fact, should be pre-ordered: a large retailer guarantees all buyers the lowest price.  If suddenly Sony decides to lower the price of the PS4 to <s>Microsoft</s> , and it will fall sharply to, for example, $ 299 before exiting, all those who pre-ordered $ 399 will still receive their $ 100 back.  Minimum price guaranteed! <br><br><h4>  What we get for $ 399 <br></h4><br><ul><li>  PlayStation 4 console itself </li><li>  Wireless joystick DUALSHOCK 4 </li><li>  HDMI cable </li><li>  Power cable </li><li>  Wired headset </li><li>  Usb cable </li></ul><br>  This kit is called Standard, however, you can do more cunning and buy the traditional Bundle from one of the proposed games: Battlefield 4, Killzone, Knack, Watch Dogs.  While the bundles are not available for pre-order, however, in the near future the opportunity to buy them will appear, and also the range of the attached games will probably expand. <br><br>  And in order for the delivery to come out a bit more profitable, we advise you to immediately purchase an additional joystick and camera for the PS4, which are also available for pre-order.  It is unlikely that they will be able to be purchased in Russia for $ 59, and prefabricated parcels from the <a href="https://qwintry.com/ru">Parcel Post are</a> always much cheaper than single shipments. <br><br>  And here are the expected games for the PlayStation 4: <br><br>  <b>Battlefield 4</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/df1/48d/ffc/df148dffcd8ea9d00bd778efd77c429f.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Killzone</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a77/0c3/a83/a770c3a830dcf786e21c0a862fe3a249.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Knack</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/114/495/406/11449540687c6108b35e07af17231d9b.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Watch dogs</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b1f/cd2/b47/b1fcd2b470206d6ebb5f2ef91714bd8e.jpg"><br><br>  Looks pretty good! <br><br><h4>  Delivery </h4><br>  The PlayStation 4 is perfect for shipping - the weight is low, which means the price will be low.  If you buy games, accessories for the console, and also try to fill the package with things as much as possible, the price for 1 kg of delivery will be reduced to $ 12. <br><br>  If you order a prefix separately, the calculation will look something like this: prefix + insurance + delivery via CPCR (available only for residents of Russia). <br><br>  <b>399 + 12 + 87 = $ 498</b> <br><br>  We change the SPRS to Priority and get the price lower by $ 13 (Available to all residents of the CIS) <br><br>  Total net savings currently $ 52-65 or <b>2000-2100</b> rubles. <br><br>  It is worth noting that sending PS4 separately is the most disadvantageous way when you have to pay about $ 32 for 1kg.  Having put together a combined package, the price for 1kg will drastically decrease - this is the maximum savings! <br><br>  Instead of buying a PlayStation 4 in Russia or Ukraine, it‚Äôs better to order it from the USA, and buy the rest of the money for games! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/187442/">https://habr.com/ru/post/187442/</a></p>
