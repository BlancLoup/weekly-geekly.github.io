      What has changed in January 2012? <br><br>  Sooner ... at the beginning briefly about me: <br>  - Age: 26 years; <br>  - Marital status: married (since February 2012), no children yet; <br>  - we live separately in St. Petersburg. <br>  - I work in the office 5 days a week from 8:30 to 17:30. <br>  - Sometimes linger, but not often. <br><br>  If you think that experience will not suit you ... Your right, but we understand that you can always think up excuses?  I thought them up for about 5 years. I know what I'm talking about. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Everyone has one Big Monday of the year. </h4><br>  We all plan to change our lives from next Monday.  Even if they made this decision on Tuesday.  Steeper than Monday, - only ‚Äúfrom the 1st day of the next month‚Äù, we usually hold such language for REAL changes in our life. <br><br>  But only once a year ... you can REALLY change yourself - JANUARY 1 *. <br>  <i>Note: usually when we say January 1, we mean the 2nd or 3rd.</i>  <i>For certain reasons.</i> <br><br><h4>  With these thoughts, I sat at the desktop on January 1 </h4><br><br>  Having met my 26th new year, after the holidays, like many, I began to think about what to change in my life.  Gleb Arkhangelsky‚Äôs book ‚ÄúTime Drive.  How to manage to live and work "(I think on the shelves of many of you gathering dust on books about" How to become rich and successful "," How to do everything ", etc. We read them with interest saying" yes, yes, how exactly and it is necessary to try it. ‚ÄùBut having already implemented all the read tips in our head, we are already bored with doing it in reality). <br><br>  <b>An important addition:</b> I think it will be honest to clarify that the root cause was that I got on the scales on January 2 and saw a figure of 89 kg (height 190) ... my weight was about 81-83 kg all my life.  Additional motivation was reflected in the mirror.  This was the main impetus to the fact that it was time to change something. <br><br>  So, there was a lot of time, and opening the chapter ‚ÄúGoals.  How to bring the dream to reality ‚Äù, I decided to fulfill the task of building my life goals in key areas: <br><br>  <i>Note: In the beginning, I again looked through the first tasks like: ‚Äúimagine one day from your life‚Äù, ‚Äúwrite yourself an epitaph‚Äù.</i>  <i>‚ÄúYour mission and goals for 15-10-5-3 years‚Äù ... but I missed them, because I never did it.</i> <br><br>  Map long-term goals.  Horizontal two axes: years, starting with the current, and your age.  Vertically - your key areas (family, career, hobby, etc.).  At the intersection of years and key areas - approximate targets. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ef5/3ad/448/ef53ad448703c6592bcbbadb82fe8d81.gif"><br><br>  <b>Making a review of life goals is not so simple.</b> <br><ol><li>  Firstly, it is not always clear what you want. </li><li>  Secondly, it is scary to tie goals to deadlines.  You have to honestly look at your life and face unpleasant truths.  For example, that going to the gym for the last 5-6 years did not bring me closer to some goal, but I was just marking time in my physical form.  And if I want to achieve some results - I need to dramatically increase the load and frequency of classes. </li><li>  Thirdly, it is difficult to begin to bear responsibility for your life.  It's one thing to dream about an apartment, a car, sporting achievements, learning new languages ‚Äã‚Äãand traveling ... another thing is to postpone entertainment and, rolling up our sleeves, get down to business. </li></ol><br><br><h4>  My long-term goals map </h4><br>  Note: The whole thrill of writing this document is that you are not responsible for anything yet, but you dream and write your true desires.  Step by step. <br><br>  <u>There are no limitations in your fantasies.</u> <br><br>  <i>Note: because</i>  <i>Habra‚Äôs fantasy is huge, I‚Äôll make a reservation that there are global limitations.</i>  <i>In 2013, you should not plan to fly to Mars.</i>  <i>This is primarily from the absence of restrictions that keep us in the comfort zone.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/d8d/ac4/b52/d8dac4b521b28a41fbe1c3f6fc4c3b67.png"><br><br>  <b>Career.</b>  You write who you are now and who you would like to become in the future.  There are no restrictions.  In my version, I am writing that I want to become the Head of the Department, and then the Deputy General Director for Economics and Finance (hidden, because I don‚Äôt want to upset the authorities with the close dates of my career growth :). <br><br>  <b>Family.</b>  I write that I plan 3 children on schedule, but you and I understand that the reality may be different, but it doesn‚Äôt matter, I‚Äôm dreaming, plotting a course on a map of life. <br><br>  <b>Sports ...</b> I would like to dwell on this.  It was this line that significantly changed my life, set new goals. <br><br>  Yes, I got married in February 2012, almost completed the repairs in the apartment (I am writing to you from the office on the balcony, the dream Boomburum presented in his article a few years ago), but I changed jobs in 2012 ... but this is largely a coincidence.  The line is <b>sport and health - always in your personal hands.</b> <br><br><h4>  My goal is to become an iron man! </h4><br><br><h5>  Birth goal </h5><br><br>  In the fall of 2011, I heard a conversation at a club training session: <br><br><blockquote>  - how is your dissertation, by the way? <br>  - Yes, now I choose another topic. <br>  - what do you think, you went through <b>Ironman</b> , - prepare an ordinary person for the competition and write a dissertation about this system. </blockquote><br><br>  Ask the coach what it is, I did not.  But the word sunk into the soul.  I remembered it just as I sat down to fill in the ‚Äúsport‚Äù column in the long-term goals map. <br><br>  And then I scored Ironman on Google and opened Youtube ... it changed my life a lot. <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/EokseUskyDI%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiQsDgN5ScdwlA5zSWw3Ck7vQ3cHw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b><a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A2%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD">Triathlon</a> Ironman ("Iron Man"):</b> swimming - 3.86 km, cycling - 180 km and marathon running - 42.195 km; <br><br>  Cool, I thought ... and drew a circle Ironman in the line of sports goals at the age of 30 years. <br><br>  Hmm ... now, I thought, I can run a maximum of 6 kilometers, swimming only breaststroke, and riding a bike a maximum of 50 km at a time ... but since I was about 30 years old, I was going to go such a distance, then at 29 years old I should go quietly Half -Ironman (swimming - 1.93 km, cycling - 90 km and running - 21 km;), in 28 it would have been nice to run a marathon 42 km‚Ä¶ <br><br>  And having drawn these goals, I realized that I would have to start training now =) <br><br><h5>  How to achieve it? </h5><br><br>  <b>Objective:</b> prepare for 4-5 years for the Ironman competition: <br><br>  <b>It is given: a</b> young man, irregularly walking in fitness, working on a sitting job 40 hours a week, hanging out in the evenings for his projects on the Internet, can run, but after 6 km he suffocates and moves to a step.  Bras can swim a couple of kilometers, and the crawl sinks a couple of meters.  Riding a mountain bike from time to time at your pleasure.  Sometimes driving 40 km to the cottage and back in the evening. <br><br>  Could you solve the problem yourself?  Probably ... but I was aware that for 5 years of going to fitness, I myself could not drastically change the proportions of my body, get pumped up, make a fishnet, etc. ... I don‚Äôt cherish the illusion that I am one of those people who pick themselves together and in spite of everything he reads books, develops methods and comes to victory. <br><br>  I needed a coach so that the problem got its solution. <br><br>  Options? <br><br>  <b>1. Personal training</b> <br>  Probably the best option, but obviously not the most budget.  In our fitness World Class training costs about 2000 rubles.  The minimum will be wisely dealt with the coach 3 times a week ... 2000 x 3 x 4 = 38,000 rubles per month.  Not my option. <br><br>  Plus, most fitness trainers are people who can do strength training, yoga, streching, functional training, swimming ... but do not tie it all into a system of cyclical sports. <br><br>  <b>2. Section for sports fans</b> <br><br>  I do not know such.  This usually involves either sections for children and teenagers.  Or for professionals of adolescence.  Middle and older age is usually not interesting to them. <br><br>  <b>3. Remote Coach</b> <br><br>  Began to read reports on sites dedicated to triathlon.  I recommend if you are interested - <a href="http://trilife.ru/">Trilifa.ru</a> - reports section.  Really motivating stories of ordinary people living in Russia. <br><br>  There I learned that in America there are a huge number of sports fans and they have created services where they lead you remotely. <br><br>  How does this happen? <br><br>  Initially, you fill out a questionnaire about yourself (ordinary data, pass a small test with a heart rate monitor and fill in the results, write whether you were involved in sports, results from competitions, what opportunities you have: fitness with a pool, a stadium nearby, a bicycle or bicycle machine, which heart rate monitor).  And also you write your goals ‚ÄúWANT TO BE LIKE AYRONMEN‚Äù =) <br><br>  Then the interaction occurs as follows: <br><br>  1. You write to the coach on Sunday, when you can practice next week. <br><br>  For example: <br>  - Monday is a hard day, just ready to swim. <br>  - Tuesday is free <br>  - Wednesday is free <br>  - Thursday I go to the theater in the evening, ready to practice 40 minutes in the morning <br>  - Friday is free <br>  - Saturday is a weekend, I do not want to do at all <br>  - Sunday is free, I would like to run in the park in the morning <br><br>  2. Sunday evening, you get a training plan (what and when and in what amount to do). <br><br>  3. All that is not clear you find out by phone or email. <br><br>  4. All that is clear you are doing =) <br><br>  5. After each workout in the evening, you upload data from your heart rate monitor to the site (Garmin Connect, polarPersonalTrainer, Trainingpeaks.com) and write comments on how you feel and how you feel. <br><br>  6. All this will then be studied by the trainer and, based on your results and well-being, will write a plan for you. <br><br>  Pros: <br>  - low cost per month; <br>  - personal plan for your capabilities (both physical and temporary); <br>  - additional motivation.  Even a personal trainer you can call and say, ‚ÄúMax, I feel bad, let's move the workout to the next week - zapar at work.‚Äù  But to write on Sunday evening, "Julian, in general, out of 5 scheduled trainings, I did only 2 ... the rest I ... somehow tired ... I was not in the mood ...".  I am ashamed to write this in general. <br><br>  <b>4. Ready-made personal training plans</b> <br><br>  On many sites, you can buy a ready-made plan for preparing for the competition, incl.  on triathlon. <br>  For example, at trainingpeaks.com. <br><br>  You will have a professional plan from well-known coaches, literate ... but I always had questions, and what will happen if I get sick for 2 weeks.  What day should I return from this plan?  In general, it is necessary to change it all the same for yourself, and I‚Äôm afraid of hurting myself or, for example, overestimating my opportunities, overtraining ... and generally abandon it all. <br><br>  So I began to study remotely with a trainer. <br><br><h5>  How did sports change my life? </h5><br><br>  <b>1. Always tangible goals in life</b> <br><br>  Even when at work one routine, I know that evening training will make me stronger and I will perform better at the next competition. <br><br>  So I know that next year, on April 7, a girl and I <i>(note the girl "write that I am a wife !!! but they won‚Äôt understand which girl to talk about.")</i> Fly to Paris for my first marathon 42 km. <br><br>  And also the crossroads of the Bosporus, the multi-day team race of TransAlp, the Marathon of the Desert in the Sahara - a whole world opens, which you have never even thought about before! <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/wy7LVotUaEM%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiF35pXcUA_32_9lyqyBT5KjQXLSg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>2. State of health and schedule of the day</b> <br><br>  In the evening I come tired after work, force myself to change clothes and run out into the street (in the winter - immediately after work I stop at fitness), when I come my beloved one is preparing me dinner or a huge bowl of cheese salad or add turkey with pasta.  After dinner, we talk for a while, and then sleep ... (I usually leave the kitchen ... right bedroom, left desktop with the computer turned off ... turn on the computer and check mail? .. no, sleep!). <br><br>  As a result, I get enough sleep, I feel great.  When the morning workout is easy to force yourself to get up and at 5:00 in the morning.  Because you understand <b>why you do it</b> . <br><br>  Slowly begin and wiping with cold water in the morning. <br><br>  Every month there are more and more friends who play sports, positive, and who share their tips and experiences.  This is cool! <br><br>  Favorite while doubts, not taking an active part in my competitions, only as a fan. <br>  But in spite of this, she had already run 5 km in the competition in Riga and she liked it ... it means that the fish pecked! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/961/549/2c1/9615492c10d7236a34c4aaeadab4bf50.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Summary </h4><br><br>  Forget about complex techniques, do not torture yourself.  Do not be upset that you can‚Äôt sleep 4 hours a day, eat some berries and roots, and you push only 25, but not 100 times. <br><br>  Wake up on January 2, well slept or not.  But the main thing in a good mood. <br><br>  Sit quietly and draw a table of "long-term goals" on paper.  Completely without torturing yourself, fantasize how you want your life to take shape. <br><br>  My wish - write yourself a cool motivating goal!  So much so that I wanted to surpass myself.  Why not a goal in part of writing code or creating a business?  First, you do it every day at work.  Secondly, there a lot depends not on you (partners, investors, subordinates and colleagues, global market conditions). <br><br>  And in amateur sports - it all depends on you personally! <br><br>  <b>Recommended sources (for read more):</b> <br>  1.
