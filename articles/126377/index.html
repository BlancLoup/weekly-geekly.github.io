  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Store automation or how to compete with supermarkets</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/20a/71e/d1f/20a71ed1f86162a0a5753dd7536f1be2.jpg" alt="image"><br>  One fine day, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãautomating a small store came up.  There were several reasons: first, the sellers stand on their feet during the entire shift, which is not comfortable;  secondly, when a person walks by himself, he cannot blame the seller for the quality of the brought goods, then he himself looks, chooses and puts in the basket, accordingly he can put not only what he came for;  thirdly, it was necessary to get rid of large queues. <br>  In this post I will try to share the experience of the organization. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  First stage: technical </h4><br>  Of course, the main issue was equipment.  The store is small, expensive equipment will not pull. <br>  I go to the first company that offers such equipment in the nearest town.  Offer bar m, 1C.  Expensive.  In addition, technical support in the village will not go, but I am not a connoisseur of 1C products (I have mutual hatred for them).  In addition, under 1C you need a licensed Windows, which can be periodically checked for licensing. <br>  I am going to the second company, a similar situation: either the equipment is more than 40 thousand, or paid products. <br>  After determining the prices, I came to the conclusion that you need to try to collect everything yourself.  But where to start?  Began to look for free software for organizing sales.  Stumbled upon Openbravo POS.  Free, easy to install, you can connect multiple computers to one base, supports the Russian language.  Liked.  Now you need a computer.  I buy an inexpensive Asus 1001px netbook.  A small, unmarked, will be on the trading floor.  It has a numpad to make it easier to enter numbers, a mouse, a usb hub (the netbook has only two ports), a handheld barcode scanner with a stand (which we have been reprogrammed for continuous scanning so that we don‚Äôt have to press a button every time).  We also need to print checks.  In all local firms there were only fiscal registrars, which I, as an emergency, do not need.  In addition, almost everyone connects to the COM port, and we only have usb.  Ordered a Star printer that supports linux.  He came a week later.  The rest of the equipment is (scales, refrigerated windows, etc.). <br><br><h4>  The second stage: installing and configuring software </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d21/3dc/db0/d213dcdb0a76bf64d85f5780ec973251.jpg" alt="image"><br>  On the netbook we put Ubuntu 10.04 LTS.  Install Openbravo POS, to it sun-java, mysql.  The scanner works as a copy-pasteur (it simply inserts the scanned digits where possible, like the command ctrl + v), therefore we simply connect it.  I put the printer through cups, I had to conjure it with its settings and Openbravo POS settings, before the check began to print normally.  On this, in general, all the automation and finished. <br><br><h4>  The third stage: audit, creation of base, additional expenses. </h4><br>  Before opening the store, did an audit.  Products that were, scored in the database.  Technique racks rearranged so that you can walk.  Previously, most of the store was empty for buyers.  Now the goods are less densely distributed over the entire area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe trading floor.  We bought baskets, small racks, fasteners for price tags (on the sides of the shelves), gun etiquette for applying prices and codes for packages without bar codes. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/570/62e/5d2/57062e5d2e74473e194e35040524f53a.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Candies, bread are packaged in packages, on which a three-four-digit code is applied, which we ourselves entered because of the absence of barcodes on such goods.  Scales are at the seller, weighting is already at the checkout.

    <h4>  Fourth Stage: Store Opening </h4><br>  It was scary for the goods that he would be stolen or spoiled.  Cases were noticed after opening, but there were few of them.  In addition, the store is located in a small village where everyone knows each other. <br>  This mini-market is mainly liked by young people and visitors.  It is customary for them.  Seniors condemn, because before sellers ran for the goods. <br>  Sellers do not always sit, they pack up the goods, if there are no buyers, go for alcoholic beverages (firstly, it is sold through another company; secondly, in the Ulyanovsk region, we have a limit on sales after 8:00 pm and up to 8: 00 alcohol is more than 15%, as well as on holidays and weekends [Saturday, Sunday]) and milk and sausage products, which are located in the freezer display case, which only sellers have access to. <br>  The shop closes at 22:00, because at this time the village falls asleep, young people wake up and fall out for strong alcohol, which is prohibited at this time. <br><br><h4>  Fifth stage: refinement </h4><br>  Yes, of course with one computer uncomfortable.  Goods had to be slaughtered after the shift was closed, because before that he was busy.  I installed a regular old computer in a warehouse, connected computers via Wi-Fi, connect to the database as a second client.  The warehouse also has Ubuntu 10.04 LTS and Openbravo POS.  I also brought an ordinary webcam to the corner of the trading hall, recordings are created through motion, in real time you can watch the camera through a browser on both computers. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/73c/20b/9c1/73c20b9c133767ee113666cde3c7043c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Results </h4><br>  According to finance: <br>  Asus Eee PC 1001PX Netbook + Mouse + Hub + Numpad = 10,000 Rubles <br>  Barcode scanner + stand = 2,700 rubles <br>  Printer Star TSP143 USB future print = 9 300 rub <br>  Additional devices for customers ~ 7 000 rubles <br>  _______________________________ <br>  Only 29 000 rubles <br><br>  29,000 rubles was enough to start selling in the new mode. <br>  An old computer was installed at the warehouse, the price of which is no more than 4,000 rubles, along with the camera. <br>  The price could have been higher, but I already had scales, racks, etc. <br><br>  <b>Pros:</b> <br><ul><li>  The bulk of the goods does not change, you do not need to hammer every time.  Only edit the price. </li><li>  Sellers got the opportunity not to cripple their legs in a shift. </li><li>  Queues decreased. </li><li>  Increased sales. </li><li>  Buyers get a check and, after coming home, can get the necessary information from it. </li><li>  Openbravo POS uses the mysql database, so it is easy to write programs for your needs. </li><li>  Openbravo POS is distributed free of charge, open source. </li></ul><br><br>  <b>Minuses:</b> <br><ul><li>  Older people are negative about this type of store </li><li>  Small, but existing, the share of thefts (which were not noticed after installing the cameras) </li><li>  Difficulties with the transition to a computer, though they passed quickly, but they were. </li><li>  Packing time increased (candies are not in trays, but in bags) </li><li>  Not all functions in Openbravo POS are made as desired (mainly concerns the number of products and price tags, which I have not set up normally) </li></ul><br><br>  What is missing now?  Screen for buyers to see how much to pay;  scales that print labels with information and a barcode, or that are simply connected to a computer;  touch screen, because Openbravo POS is adapted specifically for it.  All this can be bought, but it was decided to postpone the upgrade until better times. <br>  You should not be afraid to switch to Openbravo, especially if you are good at it.  With this program, you can also organize a cafe, and staff provide a PDA, because there is also a pda version.  I do not regret that I did not fall for Russian products, although I listened to a bunch of complaints about my decision (well, the main thing for them is to buy a paid product). <br><br>  Everyone who is going to automate their offspring, I advise you to choose this particular product.  Especially if you know how to program and understand the computer (especially in java). <br><br>  <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Openbravo_POS">Wikipedia link</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.openbravo.com/product/pos/">Link to the project</a> <br>  <a href="http://code.google.com/p/openbravoposru/">Link to Russian project</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/126377/">https://habr.com/ru/post/126377/</a></p>
