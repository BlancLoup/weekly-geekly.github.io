  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The organizers of the contest "The Best Free Project of Russia" 2010 decided to save</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It is published at the request and on behalf of Ilya Muravyov, about whom I already <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/linux/87408/">wrote</a> in a post about a problem with ctrl + shift in linux. <br><br>  I had a chance at the end of 2010 to participate in the <a href="http://www.linuxformat.ru/foss-contest">above competition</a> .  One can only say positively about the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe competition, - after all, it is one of the few ways to show oneself and evaluate the Open Source movement in Russia as a whole.  However, there is one problem. <br><br>  An impressive award, as stated by the organizers of the competition (‚ÄúLinux Format‚Äù with the support of several companies), was not given to me as the runner-up in the nomination ‚ÄúIndividual Project‚Äù.  Not given not only to me, but also to the author of GoldenDict, Isakov Konstantin, who took 1st place in the same nomination;  and the other winners of the ‚Äúcontest‚Äù will surely confirm the same thing.  And given the fact that the organizers are no longer responding by mail, this means that there will be no money (let me remind you that the competition ended in mid-December 2010).

      The point, of course, is not only in money: the goal of this post is to inform other participants of the 2010 contest, as well as possible participants of the future contest ‚ÄúThe Best Free Project in Russia‚Äù -2011, that there was no point in participating in it .

Let me remind you that the contest ended in mid-December, and now it's already the middle of July. <br><br>  Thanks attentive <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/rikardoac/" class="user_link">rikardoac</a> , it turns out there is already a <a href="http://www.linux.org.ru/news/opensource/6482179/page1">response</a> from the organizers and one of the <a href="http://www.linux.org.ru/news/opensource/6482179/page2">sponsors</a> . <br><br>  Pavel Frolov, General Director of the GNU / Linux Center (Mezon.Ru CJSC): <br><blockquote>  The situation with the Autumn Marathon and the contest ‚ÄúThe Best Free Project of Russia 2010‚Äù is as follows.  The payment to the finalists is in the schedule of our payments, but we had financial difficulties due to the fact that one of the contest sponsors refused to contribute money to the prize fund (because the person with whom we agreed on sponsorship left the company, and his colleagues refused to be responsible for his agreement with us), and another one made only partially and the second part will come to us only at the end of the summer of 2011. <br><br>  According to the situation today, we have not collected more than half of the prize fund for paying out prizes to the contest finalists, and so far we have paid nothing to the 2010 finalists.  The only option to solve this problem, which I see, is to cover the shortage from the GNU / Linux Center‚Äôs own funds, but we don‚Äôt have free money now.  Therefore, under good circumstances, we will pay rewards to all winners, including the winner of the Autumn Marathon before the end of the summer, and under the bad, until the end of 2011. <br><br>  First of all, I personally am to blame for this, because  poorly arranged with sponsors. <br><br>  - Sincerely, Pavel Frolov, General Director of GNU / Linux Center (Mezon.Ru CJSC) <br></blockquote><br><br>  Konstantin Kochereshkin, PR-manager Penguin Software <br><blockquote>  Dear participants of the contest "The Best Free Project of Russia 2010".  I was surprised to learn about the situation.  On December 28, 2010, Penguin Software Company transferred 300,000 rubles to the settlement account of ZAO Mezon.Ru (GNU / Linuktsentr).  So  all the obligations of Penguin Software, as one of the sponsors of the event, were fulfilled. <br><br>  Sincerely, Konstantin Kochereshkin PingVin Software PR-manager <br></blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/123896/">https://habr.com/ru/post/123896/</a></p>
