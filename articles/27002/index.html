With the speed of bird flu (very much like viral marketing), the recording of his conversation spread over the Internet, and immediately received a continuation in numerous remixes, collages, and even video clips.  The network is already pictures and phone accident.  I didn‚Äôt intend to write about this case, but then I read the <a href="http://www.cnews.ru/news/top/index.shtml%3F2008/06/06/303883">news</a> and still I‚Äôll write a couple of lines. <br><br>  The note says that if the fact that the record was posted by the staff of the same provider where Anton Uralsky called was called is proven, then they will face criminal prosecution.  But I was attracted to this case by another moment ... <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      The whole Internet laughs at the unhappy user (as far as the record is real, it is difficult to say, but if it is real, then I feel sorry for him, so you can get a heart attack) and treat the support service with respect.  Here, they say, what guys, survived the whole seventeen minutes of this ... And what did they endure?  All this time they explained quite calmly that the client was stupid, that he didn‚Äôt understand anything, that he hadn‚Äôt read the contract in which it was written in black and white ... From such, any person can lose his temper.  Imagine that seventeen minutes to you with mocking calmness explain that you are a complete idiot. <br><br>  Support service actions cannot be called professional.  Why?  Customer problem not resolved.  And they did not even understand what the problem was, and by and large, they did not want to understand.  And this is despite the fact that different people talked to the client, i.e.  You can talk about the general approach to working with clients in this office. <br><br>  Breaking the bond is only an external manifestation.  Perhaps the client is a fan of big movies and does not know that there are special ‚Äúrockers‚Äù that do not give a damn about breaking the connection.  Perhaps something else, but we will never know about it.  Maybe the problem would be solved within five minutes, and the client didn‚Äôt really need a ‚Äúconnection without marriage‚Äù, just tell me the solution, but don‚Äôt tell that the client is wrong. <br><br>  Recently, representatives of this provider called me and suggested connecting to the Network.  Remembering that all conversations are recorded and can be uploaded to the Internet, I sent them carefully.  And yesterday I watched on TV a report that the recordings of surveillance cameras, which are now stuck all over Moscow, are stored for at least two weeks, and information from them can be submitted upon request to the law enforcement agencies.  And I immediately remembered the record posted on the Internet of a person who spent more than 48 hours in a closed elevator.  So now, not only when you write a blog, <a href="http://journal.caseclub.ru/2008/04/16/vy-pishete-blog-u-vas-budut-problemy/">you may have problems</a> , but also when you said a careless word on the phone, or you just did not come at the wrong time in the field of view of the surveillance camera. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/27002/">https://habr.com/ru/post/27002/</a></p>
