I even observed myself [because of what I left from my previous work] <br><br>  Syndrome, if in brief, sounds like this: "I do not appreciate." <br>  A person works, works, and gradually understands that the money that he is paid here does not correspond to his skills. <br><br>  What does this look like?  I tried to draw a diagram and explain it:

    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  (if the picture on the right is not visible, refresh the browser to display svg, here is a <a href="">direct link to the image</a> ) <br><img src="http://desunote.ru/habr/skills-and-job.svg" alt="Skills and work (SVG image)" align="right"><br><br>  Suppose you have 20 skills: 10 of them are high (conditional index 20) and most of them are interesting for you (20x10), the remaining ones are low, among them 5 are interesting for you in principle.  Total, your ‚Äúprofessional index‚Äù 20x10 + 10x2 = 220. <br><br>  Your work requires you to have 10 skills of 10, each of which your qualification for starting work is 4x20 + 6x2.  One of the weak skills you are interested in, and you begin to "swing."  After a while, you study it to a fantastic level of 20 (for work you need 10).  AND‚Ä¶ <br><br><h2>  Employee position </h2><br><br>  And you feel that no one appreciates you.  Your qualification - 220, crawled to 238, and this was done in the area that the employer needs!  The tasks that you solve (in interesting skills) God forbid, if 50% of your knowledge requires.  Plus, they hang all sorts of nonsense on you, demanding to do what you are not interested in. <br><br>  This is the "do not appreciate me" syndrome. <br><br>  A person begins to feel discomfort from his work, demand an increase in salary, begins to do things that for duties didn‚Äôt give up (for example, raises dynamic routing in the grid of two routers, adds some creepy policies to the domain, etc.) , or, in the worst case scenario, begins to suffer from the watchman‚Äôs syndrome, spreading the bureaucracy and trying to artificially increase their own importance (so that everyone who can be forced to go bowing for each nonsense, and in writing).  In the best case, a person is aware of the situation and decides that something needs to be done. <br><br><h2>  Employer Position </h2><br><br>  Consider the situation from the perspective of the head.  (we believe that both parties understand the skills very well, the employer is sane, the worker is objective, etc.) <br><br>  From the position of the employer: ‚ÄúI need someone with skills of at least 100 (10x10).  This new one is not very (52), but, it seems, tries, (caught up to 60).  True, it has recently become lazy (60, as it was, a lot of work done somehow). ‚Äù <br><br>  And so, this person comes and asks for a raise.  For what?  For these 8 units of improvement?  And how much does he think about himself? <br><br>  The chief tries to explain that ‚Äúit is no longer necessary to pay for it,‚Äù but in response he was told a bunch of skills that didn‚Äôt give up on this job, and the question ‚Äúwhy the bank accountant‚Äôs bank accountant‚Äôs client doesn‚Äôt work the second day‚Äù about the crooked software and the wrong scene, which is badly danced. <br><br><h2>  What to do? </h2><br><br>  To begin with, assess how much of your work is in uninteresting areas, how long they take and how much you cope with them (and what are the prospects in terms of reducing / increasing this part). <br><br>  The most trivial and bad way: do nothing.  Uknatsya and rejoice that there is work in our difficult crisis years. <br><br>  If you understand that the work essentially comes down to the boring part, and your mega-skills are, of course, useful, but not essential - you are mistaken in the work.  If you are an office manager who wrote 300 VBA macros to himself who do everything for you, from registering the office to automatically sending birthday greetings, but you don‚Äôt come to work on time, you have a bad voice and not very charming appearance unshaven man, you are a bad office manager.  No matter how cool you rewrite the VBA / Haskel birthday greetings script, this will not make you better in terms of working as an office manager.  This is simply <em>not your job</em> . <br><br>  If you see that a lot of extraneous work is being put on you, it may be worth discussing with your superiors (not a fact that they will understand, about the syndrome of multi-armed Shiva, I will write sometime).  If you manage to persuade to release you from the uninteresting part of the work, then you can do interesting.  The only question is that you offer the employer in return for exemption from uninteresting work.  It is possible, if everything is neatly painted, it turns out that, for example, you and a couple more people need a specialist in this particular area, and the smearing by the forces of existing people is ineffective.  And you, instead, will be able to provide better here and here, since you will devote yourself to this in a larger volume.  But the likelihood of this ... well, I find it difficult to assess, but I would not be too optimistic. <br><br><h2>  Beautiful decision </h2><br>  It should be understood that in a situation ‚Äúnot at one‚Äôs work‚Äù the employer is not to blame.  And not an employee.  This is an objective situation: you are not 100% able to cope with official duties.  And your duties do not match your skills.  But you have to solve this problem, because if the employer decides for you, it will be very offensive and unpleasant. <br><br>  The best way out of this situation may be another job, which is ‚Äúhigher than you in qualifications‚Äù.  Suppose, with your same skills, you are required to 30x30 (30 different skills with an understanding level of 30).  What is wider and deeper than what you have.  In all areas. <br><br>  Will you have the feeling ‚Äúdo not appreciate me‚Äù at this work?  No, rather, on the contrary (they let me in here and endure, and teach me, how happy!). <br><br>  Will you have the prospect of qualification growth?  Yes!  Yes!  Yes! <br><br>  Will you be able to show your achievements to your employer?  Yes!  If you study, it will be clearly visible.  Even if out of these 30 dozen will be ‚Äúgray‚Äù skills that you are not interested in, the remaining 20 - this is a clear and rapid growth of you, as a specialist. <br><br>  Hence the moral: changing jobs, always strive to find work ‚Äúon the verge of qualification,‚Äù and maybe beyond.  And discussing the salary, evaluate not "yourself", but what you do and how you do it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/93203/">https://habr.com/ru/post/93203/</a></p>
