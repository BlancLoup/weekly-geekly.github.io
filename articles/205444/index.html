We have already talked about the new 2GIS, the new design and the application for the Blackberry 10. It is time to talk about another product from the new line. <br><br>  On Habr√©, no one will discover that on Android a standard dialer (he is a dialer, he is a dialer) can be replaced with any other.  From November, the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.doublegis.dialer">2GIS diver</a> can become that other. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/995/8ca/ddf/9958caddfa6b8d23c6c91384689b6fff.png"><a name="habracut"></a>

      There have always been a lot of good and different dealers on Google Play.  Some of them are interesting in design, some were impressive with customization features.  But all of them were united by one thing - in order to call somewhere with their help, you must find out the number.  A separate problem is incoming calls.  If the number is not in the phone book, then you can find out who is on the other end of the line only after ‚ÄúHello?‚Äù <br><br>  This is on the one hand.  And on the other ... no, not <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dru.dublgis.dgismobile">2GIS for Android</a> .  We decided that in this case the full version of 2GIS is not the most elegant solution to the problem.  We need a new lightweight application, which is sharpened specifically for these tasks: <br><ul><li>  convenient to dial the number; </li><li>  find a company by business, name or phone number; </li><li>  determine from which number they are calling you. </li></ul><br>  No sooner said than done.  Taking the 2GIS API and the developer of one of the best Android dealers in the history of Android, we got down to business. <br><br><h3>  Firms </h3><br>  Perhaps someone will say: - ‚ÄúHey, what for you all this?  The same can be done by a standard diler in Android 4.4! ‚Äù <br><br>  Let's figure it out.  Slightly above, we mentioned that our dealer works on <a href="http://api.2gis.ru/utm_source%3Dnews%26utm_medium%3Dhabr%26utm_campaign%3Dpost_dialer">API 2GIS</a> .  This means that we are talking about access to verified data of almost 1,500,000 companies in Russia, the CIS and Europe.  And so it has historically happened that no one has this amount of accurate and complete data on organizations, especially in Russia, except for us. <br><br>  It has become noticeably easier to deliberately miss an important call from the military office or from the sect of Scientologists. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/473/604/ca2/473604ca25fc1515d47eacc11d65bc08.png"><br><br>  But if suddenly you decide to sign up as a volunteer or just order a pizza, you can find contacts in a few taps, without leaving the dealer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/05e/7d3/c4f/05e7d3c4fc99d735ec5677d755d853ce.png"><br><br>  It would seem that everything is so cool that it cannot be better.  But it is not so.  You can replace the stock dealer on Android almost completely.  And this is "almost" for good reason.  Platform restrictions do not allow you to make your entire screen for incoming and outgoing calls, there is no single documented access to the choice of SIM cards for dual-use phones, there is no possibility to manage system notifications about missed calls.  All this is somewhat difficult to develop. <br><br>  However, the problems mentioned can be bypassed in one way or another, which is what the developers of third-party dealers are doing.  If someone is interested in how, we can tell in the comments. <br><br><h3>  Likely contacts </h3><br>  But back to the features.  In the best tradition of ‚ÄúAnd one more thing‚Äù, <a href="http://apps.2gis.ru/utm_source%3Dnews%26utm_medium%3Dhabr%26utm_campaign%3Dpost_dialer">2GIS Dialer</a> can do something else.  For example, remember who, when and where you are calling from, and then offer you this contact for one-touch dialing. <br><br>  If you call your wife from the store every night, 2GIS Dialer will remember this and the right number will be at hand at the right moment.  More precisely, under the finger.  And if any events are scheduled in your calendar, people connected with this event will be offered for a quick call.  If suddenly you are late for a meeting with the boss, it is his contact that will be offered to you first.  But do not flatter yourself - you will have to invent the reason for the delay yourself. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/131/c9e/0ee/131c9e0ee0adfc2d5ac56f1a12d54bc5.png"><br><br><h3>  Convenient search </h3><br>  You can't say which is better: T9 or QWERTY keyboard.  This dispute is originally from the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãCtrl + Shift / Alt + Shift or which side to hang the paper.  Yes, and situations are different.  There are cases when the set with T9, as they say, solves.  And there are those when the QWERTY-keyboard is the best option.  Therefore, we decided to maintain both layouts. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/296/ec9/71f/296ec971f9f3d97d4e250085992f58bb.png"><br><br>  While the product is in beta status.  The more important for us is the feedback.  We will be glad to know your opinion about 2GIS Dialer.  It is not excluded that the appearance of a new feature or the correction of a bug will be due to you.  You can install our dealer from <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.doublegis.dialer">Google Play</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/205444/">https://habr.com/ru/post/205444/</a></p>
