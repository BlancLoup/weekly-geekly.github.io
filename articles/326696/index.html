At the time of this writing, it was not known whether there would be another major version before PHP 8, for example PHP 7.2.  But it is logical to assume that the capabilities of the experimental branch will at least be included in PHP 8. </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><p>  Since its introduction in 1994, the PHP language has radically changed.  The first releases were simply external CGI programs that were created largely as a personal project of Rasmus Lerdorf.  Since the third version of PHP has been seriously reworked, there was a group of language developers. </p><br><p>  Thanks to the extensibility of PHP 3, the language functionality has expanded rapidly.  Basic and additional extensions appeared that introduced new functions in different areas: networking, parsing, caching and database support. </p><br><p>  The language itself developed, and many improvements were made to it.  There is support for object-oriented constructs, such as classes, interfaces, traits, closures, etc. <br>  But this was not enough for many developers.  With the growing popularity of the language, the demands on the community also increased, mainly related to performance, scalability, and more economical memory consumption. </p><br><p>  For almost 20 years, the creators of the language have made great efforts to meet all sorts of requirements.  Although with the advent of PHP 3, the performance has increased significantly, the language was able to demonstrate some serious results only with PHP 4, when the Zend engine appeared. </p><br><p>  In 2000, new in-memory compiler and execution model (executor model) were introduced.  This allowed again to greatly increase the performance of PHP, often 5-10 times.  As a result, it began to be seriously considered as a tool for creating web applications and sites.  And today, PHP has reached heights that no one expected from this language when it appeared. </p><br><p>  But the explosive growth in popularity of PHP has only led to increased demands for increased productivity.  Fortunately, the Zend engine has great potential to upgrade. <br>  Although PHP 5 did not become a noticeable step forward and in some cases was even slower than PHP 4, the Zend development team constantly optimized the engine from release to release, as a result PHP 5.6 was 1.5‚Äì3 times faster. </p><br><p>  But the main breakthrough came with the release of PHP 7 in December 2015.  A year later, version 7.1 was announced, which also received a number of improvements. </p><br><h2 id="kompilyator-php-jit-i-ozhidaniya-po-uluchsheniyu-proizvoditelnosti-php-8">  PHP JIT compiler and expectations for improving PHP 8 performance </h2><br><p>  A very promising version of Zend is being developed.  It will be based on the version from release 7.1, and when it comes out will not be announced yet.  So now this is an experimental JIT branch. </p><br><p>  One of the main intrigues is related to the Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation.  This is a technique for converting code to another format (native machine code) right before execution.  The goal of JIT is to increase the speed of the programs.  See if developers can keep their promise. </p><br><h2 id="benchmark-obrabotki-php-skriptov">  PHP script processing benchmark </h2><br><p>  For this article, benchmarks were used that measured the performance of script processing on purely processor tasks, that is, without input-output operations: file accesses, connections to a network or database. </p><br><p>  The following benchmarks were used: </p><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/master/Zend/bench.php">bench.php</a> is located in the php-src / Zend folder of the original PHP distribution. </li><li>  <a href="https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/master/Zend/micro_bench.php">micro_bench.php</a> - ibid. </li><li>  <a href="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/dstogov/12323ad13d3240aee8f1/raw/37fed3beb7e666b70e199bcf361af541b3c30d2d/b.php">mandelbrot.php</a> </li></ul><br><p>  Benchmarks were chased on the latest minor releases of major PHP versions: </p><br><ul><li>  5.0.5 </li><li>  5.1.6 </li><li>  5.2.17 </li><li>  5.3.29 </li><li>  5.4.45 </li><li>  5.5.38 </li><li>  5.6.28 </li><li>  7.0.13 </li><li>  7.1.0 </li><li>  <a href="https://github.com/zendtech/php-src">Experimental JIT branch</a> </li></ul><br><p>  The same benchmarks were run on all intermediate releases, for example, between 5.3.0 and 5.3.29.  The results are eloquent: the releases did not show noticeable performance improvements.  Improvements were noted only in transitions between major versions, for example, from PHP 5.4 to PHP 5.5 or from PHP 5.6 to PHP 7. </p><br><p>  This means that the same scripts will be executed at about the same speed on both PHP 5.4.0 and PHP 5.4.45. </p><br><p>  Details on setting up the host system, on the implementation of specific benchmarks and on the interpretation of the results can be read <a href="https://www.phpclasses.org/blog/post/493-php-performance-evolution.html">here</a> . </p><br><h2 id="sravnenie-rezultatov-processornyh-benchmarkov">  Comparing the results of processor benchmarks </h2><br><p>  For each benchmark, three values ‚Äã‚Äãare given: </p><br><ul><li>  <em>Time, s</em> : execution time (in seconds). </li><li>  <em>Relative change,%</em> : change in execution time compared with the previous version.  If the benchmark runs faster, the value is positive, if slower, the value is negative. </li><li>  <em>Absolute change, short</em> : how much faster the script ran compared to PHP 5.0. </li></ul><br><p>  You can see the results of benchmarking in the table below. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eb3/3a9/6c3/eb33a96c34f34f8f9bfc31a664fb1520.png" alt="image"></p><br><p>  <em><sup>(1) The</sup> benchmark cannot be executed on versions prior to 5.3, because it uses properties that have not yet been implemented.</em> </p><br><p>  <em><sup>(2)</sup> The results in this column are a bit biased, because the benchmark needs at least PHP 5.3 to work.</em>  <em>They can be taken just for reference, since it cannot be compared with PHP 5.0.</em> </p><br><p>  <em><sup>(3)</sup> This is a modified version of the mandelbrot.php script that ran too fast in version 7.1.0 in the experimental branch, so it was not possible to measure the speed accurately.</em>  <em>Therefore, we did a hundred calculations inside the script, not just one.</em> </p><br><p>  Of course, purely processor benchmarks do not allow to evaluate all aspects of PHP performance.  Data may not be representative.  Nevertheless, based on these data, we can conclude: </p><br><ul><li>  PHP 5.1 is more than twice as fast as PHP 5.0. </li><li>  Versions 5.2 and 5.3 have a new set of improvements, but not as impressive as in 5.1. </li><li>  The next performance jump was in version 5.4. </li><li>  The opcache extension came with 5.5 and 5.6.  This made it possible to improve performance by speeding up code loading, when the same script was executed sequentially.  However, opcache is not very useful for scripts running in CLI mode. </li><li>  PHP 7.0 is a major breakthrough in terms of performance.  The Zend engine has been completely redesigned, and we are seeing the result of these large-scale changes. </li><li>  In PHP 7.1, opcodes were optimized in the opcache extension, which explains the performance jump compared to 7.0. </li><li>  The experimental JIT branch demonstrates another performance leap.  But in some cases there is no improvement.  Sometimes a branch is even slower because compiling does not speed up the work of the code.  But let's not forget that this feature is still in development. </li></ul><br><h2 id="sopostavlenie-proizvoditelnosti-raznyh-versiy-php">  Comparison of the performance of different versions of PHP </h2><br><p>  PHP 5 is much more productive than PHP 4. The Zend engine that underlies the interpreter has been completely redesigned (Zend Engine 2), which paved the way for further improvements.  Here we will not cover all the differences between PHP 4 and PHP 5, briefly we will go only through the things implemented after PHP 5.0. </p><br><p>  Listed below are the changes that affected the core of PHP.

After modifying the script looked like this: </p><br><pre> <code class="php hljs"><span class="hljs-meta"><span class="hljs-meta">&lt;?php</span></span> $__start__ = microtime( <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">true</span></span> ); <span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment">/***     ***/</span></span> fprintf( STDERR, microtime( <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">true</span></span> ) - $__start__); <span class="hljs-meta"><span class="hljs-meta">?&gt;</span></span></code> </pre> <br><p>  This was done in order to ensure the stability of the dimensions of the script from the inside, without changing its behavior. </p><br><p>  2) Then there were two dry runs, so that the executable PHP files and the contents of the benchmark script were in the OS cache. </p><br><p>  3) The script was executed five times, the minimum, maximum and average execution times were maintained.

This value should be minimal, but it may turn out to be much larger than the one presented if your code refers, for example, to slow devices.  Also, the value of the value is influenced by the high OS load. </p><br><p>  On idle systems, the total value of <code>user + sys</code> should be very close to <code>real</code> .  In the example above, <code>user + sys = 1,956 , real = 1,960 </code> .  The difference of 0.004 s is not connected with our process, but with different OS tasks, for example, with dispatching. </p><br><p>  The same script was executed on a highly loaded OS with parallel compiling with three different PHP versions: </p><br><pre> <code class="bash hljs">$ time php bench.php real: 0m7.812s user: 0m2.02s sys: 0m0.101s</code> </pre> <br><p>  As you can see, the level of load greatly affects the execution time (possibly, the system time).  Therefore, I added another value to the benchmark - <code>overhead</code> operating system.  This is the difference between the total execution time ( <code>elapsed time</code> ) and the sum of user and system time. </p><br><p>  I made sure that during the benchmark run this value was less than 100 milliseconds for 99% of the time, even when the execution of scripts took tens of seconds. </p><br><h2 id="spasibo-dmitriyu-stogovu-i-vsey-komande-razrabotki-php">  Thanks to Dmitry Stogov and the entire PHP development team. </h2><br><p>  This article was written with the active assistance of Dmitry Stogov.
