  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Interesting solutions for mobile ecommerce applications</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  According to statistics, Internet users spend at least 7 hours a day on content consumption in online media daily.  Out of these seven hours, they spend about 108 minutes behind mobile devices.  In fact, in 2013 mobile commerce brought about $ 200 million to brands.  However, at the end of 2013, only 7% of brands offered to make purchases through a mobile application.  Therefore, we can say for sure that a business that is looking for points of application for the development of its ecommerce segment should pay attention to the possibilities of mobile commerce. <br>  In this material, we describe the experience of four companies that have successfully used the possibilities of m-commerce.  With the help of applications, they have become closer to their customers, have made the buying process simple, pleasant, fun and innovative. <br><br>  <b>Application that rewards user: <a href="http://www.starbucks.com/coffeehouse/mobile-apps">Starbucks</a></b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9b8/73d/906/9b873d906b6d405d8bdc31d9f358b4f4.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Starbucks mobile application is the most used application among purchases and payments in the USA.  With it, the company sells about <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/stripe-gets-80-million-starbuckss-mobile-app-payments-grow-discover-card-payment-volume-drops-2014-1">5 million cups of coffee every</a> week.  Replacing a plastic card with payment through an application, in this case, is just a pleasant technological solution.  The real value of the application in the customer reward system.  Users collect virtual stars, get free drinks, free downloads of apps, music and books, and other bonuses - this is similar to airline miles, but performed by Sturbucks.  In addition, this application also benefits the company's employees - through it you can give a tip to a barista.

      <b>Application that meets expectations: <a href="http://www.mcdonalds.se/se.html">McDonalds Sverige</a> , Sweden</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d21/00c/1c5/d2100c1c5b8f4626a0a55dda42f8d905.jpg"><br><br>  The application developed for the Swedish part of the McDonalds network, like many other similar applications, offers functions for viewing active promotions, searching for the nearest establishment, checking the operating mode, viewing new menu items and, of course, a detailed description of the composition of each dish.  But unlike traditional applications, it was in Sweden that McDonalds first introduced electronic payment for purchases through a mobile device.  A customer, having made an order at a restaurant, can scan the QR code from the cash register display and pay directly in the application through the SEQR Wallet payment system.  This simplifies and speeds up payment and allows you not to carry an offline wallet.  Previously, McDonalds in Sweden tested this payment in partnership with the Seamless delivery service for a year, and only after that the possibility of payment was introduced directly at the establishment. <br><br>  <b>Application that does not require a mobile device: <a href="https://squareup.com/">Square Wallet</a></b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/637/7b8/6a5/6377b86a56724c329225ca2c89101004.jpg"><br><br>  Initially, there was the Square app, which, complete with a small proprietary <a href="https://squareup.com/reader">device</a> that reads information from credit cards, made it possible to quickly pay for purchases.  Now appeared Square Wallet, which allows you to shop, just by calling your name.  First you need to download the Square Wallet app, attach a credit card to it and upload a selfie.  It remains to come to your favorite store, call the cashier your name and enjoy the purchase.  The security of such a payment was ensured by the fact that the information on the user's credit card was stored on the server, and not on the client device. <br>  * At the moment, the Square Wallet project is closed, as it has not gained enough popularity, the company launched a new service for mobile payments <a href="https://squareup.com/pickup">Square Pickup</a> * <br><br>  <b>Application that took ‚Äúgold‚Äú on Digiday Mobi Awards: <a href="http://www.rei.com/">REI</a></b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ea8/490/f14/ea8490f140844b5891176bd6d4d0f2ac.jpg"><br><br>  REI, a well-known retailer of outdoor and sportswear and accessories, won in the most impressive way according to the criterion of innovative mobile applications over the past year as part of the Digiday Mobi Awards in the category ‚ÄúBest Mobile Application in the E-commerce / Retail Segment.‚Äù Applications from <a href="http://www.rei.com/mobile/rei-shopping-app.html">Shopping</a> and Snow Report proved to be excellent in terms of e-commerce, innovation and advantages in mobile media and marketing.  The Shopping application allows you to get a convenient digital storefront with the characteristics of each product and customer reviews, as well as customer support data.  The Snow Report app helps REI clients stay up-to-date on the current weather forecast at a ski resort and share this information with friends on Facebook and Twitter.  In addition, the REI application, which allows you to manage the account and credit of your card, took its place at the very top of the ranking in the m-commerce sphere: the REI Visa application. <br>  _______________ <br>  This is a translation of the Janna Leyde article from <a href="https://www.2checkout.com/blog/article/e-commerce-mobile-apps-4-companies-that-do-it-right">2checkout.com</a> . <br><br>  Do you use a smartphone / tablet for shopping?
