Their total value is steadily growing and, according to experts, this year amounted to 1.95 trillion.  dollars, which, despite the difficult economic situation, is 1.7% higher than in 2008.

      First place in the list among all companies in the world is Google, whose brand was valued at a whopping 100.039 billion (against 86.057 billion in 2008 - that is, it grew by 16%).  Colleagues of the leader in the field of IT-technologies from this list occupy the following places: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  2. Microsoft - 76.2 billion <br>  4. IBM - 66.622 billion <br>  6. Apple - 63.113 billion <br>  26. Amazon - 21.294 billion <br>  54. Ebay - 12.97 billion <br>  81. Yahoo - 7.927 billion. <br><br>  The value of the Yahoo brand for the year dropped immediately to 19 positions, although in the summer of 2002, Google‚Äôs executives were ready to <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/columns/4967/">sell the company to Yahoo for 5 billion</a> , but buyers considered this amount to be too high. <br><br>  Now, Google puts its name in all its products, which increases the price of the name compared to the main pursuer - Microsoft, which has many more brands on the market (Windows, Bing, etc.).  Thus, by offering users free of charge numerous Internet services and technology solutions, thanks to which Google selects the appropriate advertising for each user, the company has the potential to earn more than $ 100 billion when selling them, even if it reserves the advertising network.  At the same time, the value of the Google brand is approaching the value of the company's market capitalization, which is 157.56 billion and is earned mainly through advertising.  But at the same time, Google‚Äôs capitalization is inferior to Apple from 159.37 billion due to its orientation to expensive market segments.  For example, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/apple/65296/">91% of Apple in the computer market is more expensive than $ 1000</a> : if we count by the number of PCs sold, then Apple‚Äôs total share in the market is only 8.7% (in 2009), but if we count in terms of sales in dollars, the company has a much better result because sells only expensive computers. <br><br>  Among the newcomers to the rating is the Russian Beeline brand (owned by VimpelCom OJSC), which was recognized as one of the ten most expensive global brands in the telecommunications market and ranked 72nd (brand value is 8.884 billion).  Until 2008, there were no Russian names in the global ranking of the 100 most expensive global brands. <br><br>  It is surprising that the price of a single Google brand is almost equal to the total price of 5 leading giants in the global auto industry (101.392 billion) whose names have been familiar to more people for decades: Toyota, BMW, Porsche, Mercedes and Honda. <br><br>  Judging from the fact that even in a united Europe, a third of residents have never used the Internet (from <a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do%3Freference%3DIP/09/1221%26amp%3Bformat%3DHTML%26amp%3Baged%3D0%26amp%3Blanguage%3DEN%26amp%3BguiLanguage%3Den" title="Will open in a new window">the European Commission report</a> ), such indicators of IT companies in the rating of the cost of the name itself indicate the transformation of the global network from the dump of adult content (according to some information, up to 80% of Internet traffic accounts for exactly pornography) in the habitat of the world's largest business. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/66434/">https://habr.com/ru/post/66434/</a></p>
