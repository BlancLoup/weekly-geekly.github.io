However, the neglect of certain rules, can create significant inconvenience to the interlocutor. <br><br>  Described below does not apply to formalized rules of etiquette, but only describes the common problems that creates a negligent attitude towards self-identification on the Internet. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Sincerely, Alexander </h4><br>  The screenshot above shows a common problem encountered in business communication. <br>  It is foolish to think that you are the only "Alexander" with whom your interlocutor is familiar.  And if the interlocutor talks about working with a large number of people, it will definitely be very difficult for him in a day or two to remember that he communicated with you specifically, and even more so to find you in the contact list.  Therefore, you have to view the log of correspondence with each Alexander to find the right one in him.

      <i>A short video about the importance of the last name:</i> <br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/CCZjKgj-BPs%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjTMG1o-96ksvIGXMaSRkQCDVbmHQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  If you represent the company, and use the IM client only for business communication, it is appropriate to add the company name after the name.  For example, instead of ‚ÄúVasya‚Äù it is better to write ‚ÄúVasily Shishkin (webstudio.ru)‚Äù <br><br>  And even if you do not represent any company, and among friends you are known as simply Vasya, imagine how many more Vasiliev may be in the contact list of your friends, and take the trouble to add, if you don‚Äôt have a last name, then at least a unique alias for it. <br>  For example, ‚ÄúVasya Krutaya‚Äù or ‚ÄúVasya Well done‚Äù, so as not to get lost among a dozen other Vasya in the contact list. <br><br>  As a result, due to inattention to filling out your profiles, you are forcing your buddies to edit your profile on their own.  Rename you from ‚ÄúVasya‚Äù to ‚ÄúVasya Web Design‚Äù, add a mobile phone in your Skype profile and so on. <br><br>  <i>List of signature recommendations in any messengers:</i> <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Never subscribe by name only</b> .  Specify a surname or nickname instead of a surname </li><li>  <b>Specifying only an alias without a name, choose easily memorable and quite unique.</b>  For example, <b>Black</b> is a bad pseudonym, <b>Fedor Lobster</b> is a good nickname. </li><li>  <b>No extraneous characters, emoticons, parentheses, asterisks.</b>  Type "* Light))) *", "- &lt;&lt; == SuperNagibator == &gt;&gt; -".  Even in elementary school this is a shame </li><li>  If you represent a company and from this account you only talk about work, you can enter the company name after the name </li><li>  <b>Fill out the vcard.</b>  Specify in the profile the company's website, work phone.  If this is Skype, then indicate in the profile a personal phone.  Being abroad is very convenient to call on your mobile from Skype without having to manually rewrite it. </li><li>  <b>Choose meaningful and strict logins.</b>  In any case, you will have to dictate them by ear.  Instead of leno4ka222, kjaaaxi, siooaoa7, it‚Äôs better to prefer elenazaeitseva, k.antonov, ivanov.max </li><li>  <b>Do not change the name in the profile.</b>  Once you choose the correct name, never change it.  Very annoying when you can‚Äôt find Andrei Zaitsev in the contact list who suddenly became ‚ÄúAndrei Bunny‚Äù </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Publications </h4><br><br>  I often turn to friends who do not have an account on Habr√©, asking them to ask the author of something.  Because they cannot comment on the article, and the author did not leave any contact information in the profile.  Well even if his login can google and find the eponymous VKontakte or Facebook.  But it happens that this is impossible. <br><br>  Byvet, an exotic question arises, like "What type of plug is in this undocumented Chinese chip of reverse osmosis filter controller?"  And as a result of googling, you find by God a forgotten forum, where one and a half people sit and one of them is just the owner of this rare chip and knows everything about it. <br>  And in his profile: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/668/172/c51/668172c51838d1a82bd2b15cb22a2f67.png"><br>  And rather, usually something like "I was on the site: <b>8 months ago</b> ." <br><br>  Therefore, if you publish anything on the Internet that may even interest someone, even if it seems to you not very popular and not interesting, or you just blog for yourself, shoot videos, share your experience on the forum, work hard to you could be contacted by public methods.  Eliminate the need to register on youtube, forum, live journal, twitter just to write to you.  Specify in the public place contact details. <br><br><ul><li>  Being engaged in public activities - provide an opportunity to discuss this with you.  For example, include anonymous comments and </li><li>  Indicate in public places relevant means of communication.  Remember that you can stop visiting forums / LiveJournal and not read private messages sent through these services. </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/208622/">https://habr.com/ru/post/208622/</a></p>
