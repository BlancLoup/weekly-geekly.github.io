  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Series as a tool in raising children</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Over the past few years, the television series industry has made an unprecedented high-quality race, moving from the category of "soap" to the category of an expensive, high-quality and sought-after product.  The budgets and casting of some TV projects today can be envied by many Hollywood movies.  In modern slang terminology, such an expression as ‚ÄúI am addicted to this series‚Äù has become firmly established.  Many people rush from work when a new series of their favorite TV series appears in the network, and more often TV shows, in a valid translation. <br><br>  Such a popularization of serials led to the fact that all who felt like it rushed to this market.  Film companies and TV channels do everything to ‚Äúget into the stream‚Äù, they even rewrite the scripts that are already ready for filming movies for TV-format.  This leads to the fact that a lot of second-rate product is thrown on the screens along with worthy things. <br><br>  Naturally, a child who, because of his age, is a sponge for all possible information, once in such an environment, can begin to look at everything, which can adversely affect both his psyche and his worldview as a whole.  It is unlikely, for example, the hero of "Fornication California" Hank Moody can be a good example in raising a young man. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fbb/253/d43/fbb253d43eb74c5c834fc042ce898086.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      The fact is that foreign serials are created for those who can pay for a HBO or ABC subscription - adults.  But the Internet, piracy and torrents give our children unlimited access to content, some of which can negatively affect a child. <br><br>  However, it would be foolish to completely restrict children from TV shows, as many of them are really good and are able to develop a love of neighbor, an understanding of the social structure of society, and some can help a child to study school subjects or just start thinking logically. <br><br>  So, what series would be useful to see the child. <br>  ( <i>Footnote. I took into account the series, released or completed relatively recently, say, in the last 10 years, "Helene and the guys" and "Rebellious spirit" did not take :) domestic also does not count)</i> <br><br>  <b>"Friends" (1994-2004)</b> <br>  The series tells about six, oddly enough, friends who just live their lives, but they do it very nice and fun.  If you dig deeper, the heroes display in themselves collective stereotypes of modernity (a failed actor, a middle manager, a scientist, a fashionista, a housewife, and ... Phoebe).  This series is simply obliged to instill in a child kindness, the ability to appreciate friends and forgive offenses.  The absence of any negativity in ‚ÄúFriends‚Äù will allow you not to worry about what your child is watching for as many as 10 seasons. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/699/2e9/07f/6992e907fdee5654355d9127bfdf0acd.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>"Gilmore Girls" (2000-2007)</b> <br>  Your daughter is a teenage girl and is now experiencing a transitional period, and in this connection, are your relations strained, to say the least?  Look with her this series about mom and daughter from a small provincial town.  The film lucidly tells us that it is impossible to upset parents, how carefully one should choose one‚Äôs environment, and that mom can also be a best friend. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/aed/316/59c/aed31659c309b9bc7cf9384b120945ee.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  By the way, for better control over the child during his time at school, you can use the <a href="https://www.shkolnaya-karta.ru/enter_parents">‚ÄúInput-output‚Äù</a> and <a href="https://www.shkolnaya-karta.ru/journal_parents">‚ÄúElectronic diary‚Äù</a> <a href="https://www.shkolnaya-karta.ru/">modules</a> from <a href="https://www.shkolnaya-karta.ru/">‚ÄúSmiles.School card‚Äù</a> - with them you will know if your obstinate child does not miss lessons and is diligently engaged in them. <br><br>  <b>The Simpsons (1989- ...)</b> <br>  Let's touch on the topic and animated series.  Despite the fact that this cartoon, above all, should amuse, both children and adults.  Each of his series has a hidden meaning.  Cartoon characters raise acute social themes and ridicule the problems of society. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8d3/920/954/8d3920954128bbc87dcef5c2db889491.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Firefly (2002-2003)</b> <br>  Like ‚ÄúFriends‚Äù, ‚ÄúFirefly‚Äù is an infinitely kind series, its millions of fans simply broke their hearts, interrupting it after the first season (albeit they are talking about continuation lately).  Through one of the favorite themes for children, such as space adventures, the series tells about very important things - the values ‚Äã‚Äãof human life, devotion, honor and love.  In general, it teaches very rare in our time qualities. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c77/50d/b06/c7750db06475fcc3af25cd9ed48dd48a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Let's move on to more serious things. <br><br>  <b>The Big Bang Theory (2007- ...)</b> <br>  The story tells how four friends-scientists, initially locked in their geeky social circle, begin to interact with external society after meeting with their blonde neighbor.  In addition to the fact that the series is simply kind and funny, it instills the skills of communication with the outside world, because in the beginning the main characters really behave like children in the bodies of adult men.  They go through the stage of first communication with the opposite sex, conflicts at work, etc. Another positive aspect of TBB is the series shows that science can be fun, the characters often carry out interesting experiments, working on various projects, and also manage to combine a successful career a scholar and a passion for comics and video games. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/857/c3b/98d/857c3b98d41e8638e06a6c924b79a476.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  By the way, also helps to combine science and entertainment, the application <a href="https://www.shkolnaya-karta.ru/app">"Schoolboy"</a> from <a href="https://www.shkolnaya-karta.ru/">"Smiles.School card"</a> <br><br>  <b>Sherlock (2009- ...)</b> <br>  Not only that, after watching the show, the child will most likely want to read the original series of books, which in itself is already a plus, an interesting plot and undying intrigue throughout the entire series, will force the child to think, put forward and refute his own theories like ?  Some may say that there is violence in the series.  But it is everywhere now, but this is the very example when good will surely defeat evil and at the same time not cut it in two with a huge sword. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/208/0d4/e3a/2080d4e3a2eea964a23b73e3547865a1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  You may not believe me but ... <b>‚ÄúDoctor House‚Äù (2004-2012)</b> <br>  The series is about another sociopath, but in this case it appears to be more like an example of how not to behave with people.  If the aforementioned Henk Moody, with all his negative qualities and actions, lives and enjoys life, then the character Hugh Laurie is always unhappy.  Given that he saves lives to people every day, he is lonely and causes more pity.  And if I were a child, I would make all possible efforts not to be like him, and therefore, to be a sociable person with a chance for a happy life.  In addition to social significance, this series can push the child to study the natural sciences, and, who knows, maybe a new Amos will come out of it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/307/546/54c/30754654cb388aa0cb52cf975d8269b6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  This is not a complete list of useful series that can be offered to a child.  Even I, a burnt serialist, cannot swallow and digest all the volume that modern TV offers.  So study the question and make your list.  Make it so that ‚Äúserialomania‚Äù becomes as useful as possible for your child. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/721/ebd/af3/721ebdaf3a2b5443904e7d9f4f855ce2.jpg" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/377313/">https://habr.com/ru/post/377313/</a></p>
