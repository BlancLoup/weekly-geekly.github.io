In this regard, we publish in our blog translations from the Upload VR portal on top games for HTC Vive, PSVR and Oculus Rift.  <b>Today we will talk about the top 9 games for the PlayStation VR</b> , translation under the cut.  By the way, all readers of Habr have a <a href="http://vr.hsbi.ru/">20% discount on tickets</a> for the VR-Today conference on the promo code habr.  And to all active participants of Habr with karma of 20 and above I will be glad to give a ticket for free (write in a personal for this). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Thanks to PlayStation VR, the era of console games in virtual reality has finally arrived.  Sony's helmet is not as powerful as the Oculus Rift or HTC Vive, and not as portable as the Samsung Gear VR or Google Daydream View, nor does it provide so steep tracking yet, but it brings VR at an affordable price and with a nice set of software in more than 50 million homes owners of the fourth playstation. <br><br>  There are already dozens of games for PSVR and it‚Äôs just incredible to see such a huge number of offers on the shelves and in the PSN Store.  Which games are the best?  What if I want a shooter and a music game or an adventure title and horror?  We have compiled our list of 9 top PSVR games that can already be played to alleviate this problem.

You must download them anyway. <br><br>  The games described below are not listed in any special order, and some worthy representatives were not included in the list.  There are already quite beautiful games on PSVR, but these are the ones that we thought were the best. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">RIGS: Mechanized Combat League</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rnqlf9EQ2zA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div></div><br>  <b>[Rating: 8/10]</b> <br>  If PlayStation VR is here to prove that a decent virtual reality is possible on a home console, then <b>RIGS is</b> here to prove that VR games can provide a fast, intense, competitive multiplayer shooter, unlike anything else on any other helmets.  It combines the features of such action games as the <b>Unreal Tournament</b> with fighting robots and a futuristic sports league. <br><br>  And the disadvantages of <b>RIGS are</b> compensated by the depth and breadth of the game possibilities.  A variety of ways of destroying furs, as well as variations of the furs themselves, make this game very exciting, worth returning to again and again.  In the coming months, even more cards, abilities, game modes and other features are planned to appear, which is guaranteed to bring the game the recognition it deserves. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Until Dawn: Rush of Blood</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gX4-GGUzpdI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div></div><br>  <b>[Rating: 7/10]</b> <br>  If you are looking for something that could make your pulse more frequent, then stop searching, there is <b>Until Dawn: Rush of Blood</b> .  This festival of horror is based on the same universe as <b>Until Dawn</b> , a horror adventure on PS4 based on narrative.  In this spin-off, you are immersed in the metaphorical, and quite literal depths of hell, fighting off crazy clowns and creepy monsters. <br><br>  I will not lie and say that this is almost the best that VR has to offer, as it included PSVR games with a higher rating in this list, but this game satisfies one of the special needs very well.  The 360-degree audio does an excellent job of immersing you in the atmosphere, and the unexpected scarecrows are so well substituted at the right moment that it is impossible to break away from the desire to see what is there at the next turn.  This crazy, unlike other shooter lasts more than 3 hours in single player mode on normal difficulty, which is fine for its price. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Battlezone</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jKKHNDg_src" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div></div><br>  <b>[Rating: 8/10]</b> <br><br>  After you finish taking out enemies in enemy furs and urinating under yourself from piercing terror, it will be time to take control of the futuristic tank in the updated and improved <b>Battlezone</b> .  The series debuted decades ago, when the games were just lines and pixels, but now with the VR capabilities, it is back in a fresh 3D shell. <br><br>  Other VR shooters make you fight against each other, but <b>Battlezone</b> is a triumph of cooperative strategies.  If you have a couple of friends with PSVR helmets, then this game will be the best choice that will allow you to become super powerful neon death machines. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">How we soar</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2rIjBDwdVqs" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div></div><br>  <b>[Rating: 8/10]</b> <br>  This game is not for everyone and it is difficult to objectively evaluate it without trying it yourself, but for those gamers who enjoy a more esoteric gameplay, something that causes a calming feeling of relaxation, mixed with magnificent views, it will find quite interesting. <br><br>  There is no action-rich gameplay in it, as in the same <b>Eagle Flight</b> , but more and more slowly, thoughtfully and beautifully.  The game is more like a walking simulator adapted to the surrounding space, but those who like to enjoy such things will discover one of the most exciting journeys with PSVR. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xJAfYUjpdKA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div></div><br>  <b>[Rating: 9/10]</b> <br>  PSVR fans have been waiting for this game since it was announced at E3 in 2016. <b>Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</b> did so much that it‚Äôs hard to believe that Capcom did succeed.  First of all, he reopens the series of <b>Resident Evil</b> , which is now sluggishly stagnant, by switching the perspective from third-person to first-person.  However, by introducing this change, this new game returns to the original format of Survival Horror, achieving a wonderful effect. <br>  But the most impressive achievement is the fact that the game provides more than 12 hours of gameplay, which can be fully experienced in VR with many convenient options.  The oppressive atmosphere, memorable storyline and gameplay deserve the fact that this game would receive the highest rating among the entire heap of horror over the past few years. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">EVE: Valkyrie</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/S5gylV-_bUA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div></div><br>  <b>[Rating: 9/10]</b> <br>  In our old review on <b>EVE: Valkyrie</b> , when it was released only on Oculus Rift, we called it a game for which VR helmets were created.  Now it is available on both HTC Vive and PSVR, and supports full cross-platform multiplayer between these three main devices, and our initial opinion about the game was justified even more. <br><br>  With a lot of game mods that were released for free from the very launch of the game on the market, as well as with new maps and ships, <b>EVE</b> has become a game containing tons of content.  Competitive multiplayer battles are still the heart of the gameplay, which offers one of the most intense multiplayer matches among all other games. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Thumper</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gtPGX8i1Eaw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div></div><br>  <b>[Rating: 9/10]</b> <br>  Believe me, you just have to play <b>Thumper</b> .  This game is so difficult to describe correctly that even watching a video will not give you the desired impression.  But, alas, this is the only way I can support my words here, so this is all there is.  Simply put, this is one of the most viscerally satisfying and visually exciting experiences that you can experience with any existing VR helmet. <br><br>  It is described as a game with cruelty and rhythm.  In <b>Thumper,</b> you find yourself on a track and have to push buttons, turn, dodge in the rhythm of the soundtrack, until your face melts.  It is dark, unusual, sometimes annoying, but simply fantastic. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Bound</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zbjb2S4kF8Q" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div></div><br>  <b>[Rating: 9/10]</b> <br>  It is excusable if you would say that this is not a VR title at all, since at first it was exactly that.  But the free update added support for VR and added the game to the list of some of the most unique and exciting adventures you can try with PSVR. <br><br>  <b>Bound</b> tells the emotional and nothing else is a secret story, and its stunning world of vivid visual effects and dances are worth it that even the most jaded gamers would try the game. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">DiRT: Rally</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NUKbZNCbpqk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div></div><br>  <b>[Rating: 9/10]</b> <br>  On the Oculus Rift <b>DiRT: Rally has</b> quickly become one of the best racing games on the VR market since it came out last year.  Fast, intense speed tracks, the environment and the perfect gameplay are perceived as a revolution in the genre.  Now that she‚Äôs released on PSVR, all these impressions can be obtained on a more affordable and budget device.  In addition, it is almost identical to the version on the Oculus Rift. <br><br>  The new cooperative mode, which was created specifically for PSVR, looks strange, only a shadow of what it could be, but this does not spoil the main impression.  Despite everything, <b>DiRT: Rally is a</b> decent racing that plunges you into sensations, making you feel a risk to life and excitement when you let your car through a dirty Welsh forest, with a premonition that you are about to crash.  This is one of the few VR adventures that can completely absorb you and make you forget that you are in your living room. <br><br>  <i>At this translation came to an end.</i>  <i>Live to try the games and non-gaming capabilities of virtual reality can be with us on May 17 from 11:00 to 18:00.</i>  <i>There will be testing of various VR devices, including Epson Moverio BT-300 augmented reality glasses, communication with developers of virtual reality costumes for full immersion, VR project shows, VR attractions, VR cinema and a number of reports with practical cases of introducing VR in various fields .</i>  <i>One of the reports will be devoted to the very topic of PSVR, or rather, <b>how to graduate on PSVR and not go crazy</b> using the example of the Virry VR project.</i>  <i>For all readers of Habr, we decided to make a 20% discount on a ticket.</i>  <i>When <b><a href="http://vr.hsbi.ru/">registering,</a></b> use the code "habr" in the "from where you learned about the event."</i>  <i>And if you have more than 20 karma, then I will give you a ticket, write for this in a personal.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/326424/">https://habr.com/ru/post/326424/</a></p>
