And then somehow the docker stopped being interesting: he just is, he is in all and in all.  On it all microservices, Kubernetes, devops - anything.  However, people are pulling containers into their mouths from anywhere.  They often do not even know what is inside there. <br><br>  What is interesting to DevOps engineers now?  The team of superheroes - the DevOops conference program committee - fell into a devilish trap in Hangouts and answered questions for an hour.  (Who are all these people - it is in detail written <a href="https://devoops.ru/organizers/">according to the link</a> ). <br><br>  Under the cut - an interview, colored with crayons.

Previously, the docker was a cool, youthful thing in itself.  And then somehow the docker has ceased to be interesting, that is, it is there, it is for everyone and in everything, it has all microservices, Kubernetes, devops, whatever.  But in itself, the docker as a technology suddenly somehow interests no one anymore.  Do not run the same java on the servers, it is clear that the containers.  It really mesmerizes me. <img width="100%" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ex/ih/z-/exihz-diqt5bjn1hibjszexxeuq.png"><br clear="all"></p><p><img width="48" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8e/ky/kz/8ekykzda9qgrzcubfisv7pi2mdm.png">  People usually discuss what they have problems with or direct tasks.  There were no problems in the docker, and were they there? <img width="100%" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/k9/kx/3f/k9kx3f08geskm6oqgvhb0g_8u0w.png"><br clear="all"></p><p><img width="48" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hv/gb/eh/hvgbehlaaxry8zosvn8wra3-16e.jpeg">  There were a lot of problems in Docker, and they really decided.  In addition, we stopped using those parts of the docker that were painful.  Docker had things he could do very well.  And there are those that are bad. <img width="100%" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ex/ih/z-/exihz-diqt5bjn1hibjszexxeuq.png"><br clear="all"></p><p><img width="48" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8e/ky/kz/8ekykzda9qgrzcubfisv7pi2mdm.png">  Give an example. <img width="100%" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/k9/kx/3f/k9kx3f08geskm6oqgvhb0g_8u0w.png"><br clear="all"></p><p><img width="48" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hv/gb/eh/hvgbehlaaxry8zosvn8wra3-16e.jpeg">  For example, jails in unix-processes - everything is very good and smart there.  It really works very cool.  But for example, the connectivity between microservices that run in containers, clusters, deployments, it was all hell and nightmare. <img width="100%" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ex/ih/z-/exihz-diqt5bjn1hibjszexxeuq.png"><br clear="all"></p><p><img width="48" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gs/n-/bk/gsn-bkxiljmlo9ni_ap8thr9uhc.png">  You mean the Swarm, which they tried to keep up with the Kubernetes? <img width="100%" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ck/o4/j9/cko4j9qh7prmqrdydtjin0npsty.png"><br clear="all"></p><p><img width="48" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hv/gb/eh/hvgbehlaaxry8zosvn8wra3-16e.jpeg">  Yes, I mean Compose, that was all a nightmare and hell.  And we decided not to use it, but to use only what works, what is clear and free.  And the docker has become very cool on the one hand, and on the other hand has ceased to be interesting.  Docker and docker - well and good. <img width="100%" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ex/ih/z-/exihz-diqt5bjn1hibjszexxeuq.png"><br clear="all"></p><p><img width="48" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gs/n-/bk/gsn-bkxiljmlo9ni_ap8thr9uhc.png">  Now, when you look at a new software, first of all you look at whether there is a ready container.  It is desirable from the manufacturer of this software.  Then you look at how to unfold it and poke it with a wand.  Docker delivered us complex services to poke on a working machine.  Now it is not so important, makos you or Linux.  The same Sentry consists of 5-6 components, which you will separately start to run.  And if your task is just to see how it looks good, send a signal and watch how it decomposes there.  Now it will take 15 minutes - launched, unwrapped, and the piece will be on Ruby, a piece on Java, God forbid, some Elasticsearch - which will die with the same docker. <img width="100%" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ck/o4/j9/cko4j9qh7prmqrdydtjin0npsty.png"><br clear="all"></p><p><img width="48" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dw/uj/yz/dwujyz-bfhuzwow-ysymznzghkc.jpeg">  Most importantly, he will die later. <img width="100%" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0s/ol/zl/0solzl-uukdf1yxvitnpzcrtw4s.png"><br clear="all"></p><p><img width="48" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gs/n-/bk/gsn-bkxiljmlo9ni_ap8thr9uhc.png">  Yes, this is a separate charm.  Previously, it was possible to spoil yourself in the system so that there was nothing in / usr / local.  And it will still rise - from someone in / opt, from someone in / usr / local, from someone else somewhere.  And your system is swelling, overgrown with all unnecessary.  This is one thing, and the second is that the more unnecessary you have, the larger the vector of attack on you, which is why you can be offended.  And since we are all launching it now in dockers, then security is here, and clean, and you don‚Äôt carry all sorts of nasty things with you. <img width="100%" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ck/o4/j9/cko4j9qh7prmqrdydtjin0npsty.png"><br clear="all"></p><p><img width="48" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8e/ky/kz/8ekykzda9qgrzcubfisv7pi2mdm.png">  Listen, ladies and gentlemen, you do a conference on devops, and there if the docker has become boring and uninteresting, what now, the docker will not be? <img width="100%" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/k9/kx/3f/k9kx3f08geskm6oqgvhb0g_8u0w.png"><br clear="all"></p><p><img width="48" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hv/gb/eh/hvgbehlaaxry8zosvn8wra3-16e.jpeg">  First, the docker will be everywhere.  The fact that it has become boring and uninteresting does not mean that it will no longer be used.  On the contrary, this means that we now use it and do not pay attention.  That is, he is everywhere.  He is not a topic for a separate conversation at conferences. <img width="100%" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ex/ih/z-/exihz-diqt5bjn1hibjszexxeuq.png"><br clear="all"></p><p><img width="48" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8e/ky/kz/8ekykzda9qgrzcubfisv7pi2mdm.png">  Does he have any reports?  If I enter the program now and write the word docker, will there be nothing? <img width="100%" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/k9/kx/3f/k9kx3f08geskm6oqgvhb0g_8u0w.png"><br clear="all"></p><p><img width="48" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hv/gb/eh/hvgbehlaaxry8zosvn8wra3-16e.jpeg">  Write it.  Let's do this great experiment. <img width="100%" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ex/ih/z-/exihz-diqt5bjn1hibjszexxeuq.png"><br clear="all"></p><p><img width="48" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8e/ky/kz/8ekykzda9qgrzcubfisv7pi2mdm.png">  Wrote, and it says: <a href="https://devoops.ru/2018/spb/talks/2yl4oqifo4oqqmwwgwg4as/">Practical steps for securing your container deployment</a> <img width="100%" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/k9/kx/3f/k9kx3f08geskm6oqgvhb0g_8u0w.png"><br clear="all"></p><p><img width="48" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/za/xu/g3/zaxug3symhuviekalpytlb5efbu.png">  This is a reflection of the fact that docker allows our modern systems to be safer in a natural way.  In addition, it reflects one more thing that may have changed too lately ... Devops has become more.  Let's just say, they have become increasingly imbued with large companies.  And along with them, there were more and more conversations on the topic of security, which a devops can bring or, on the contrary, break this security.  Liz's report is about how to properly prepare this devops so that your guards would be happy. <img width="100%" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bh/tb/ad/bhtbadr2-ts3l1zwpgkduprh_ww.png"><br clear="all"></p><p><img width="48" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8e/ky/kz/8ekykzda9qgrzcubfisv7pi2mdm.png">  Do you personally know the speakers?  Who is Liz Rice? <img width="100%" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/k9/kx/3f/k9kx3f08geskm6oqgvhb0g_8u0w.png"><br clear="all"></p><p><img width="48" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hv/gb/eh/hvgbehlaaxry8zosvn8wra3-16e.jpeg">  Liz is quite an important figure in the landscapes.  She is the head of all KubeCons.  Actually, Liz is, first, a very good speaker.  Secondly, she works for Aqua Security, which deals with the security of containers.  We will not find the best person for the story about the safety of containers than the one who specifically deals with this.  What is interesting specifically about the reports of Liz, I have seen many of her reports - this is what she is trying to solve a rather complicated problem.  The problem is that today security is, firstly, complex, and it becomes more complicated and more difficult, as attacks become more sophisticated.  Accordingly, it becomes more difficult to protect oneself from them, we have to encrypt our information via REST, we have to encrypt in-traffic, all kinds of TLS, https, certificates, protocols ... it's all <i>complicated</i> .  With the letter A at the end.  Firstly, it‚Äôs difficult, and secondly, there‚Äôs no way out of it, because you can‚Äôt say now: ‚ÄúOh, I don‚Äôt know, let me not do https.  Well, who cares who I need. ‚Äù  Since the same vile Chrome will immediately shout at all your users that everything is not secure for you.  And this is a combination of complexity and necessity, it freezes, because it is not our concern, we are not all safe.  On the other hand, it lies with us, because we cannot just ignore these aspects.  In her reports, Liz is trying to simply and clearly convey key aspects of container safety to people who are far from safety, and this is very cool. <img width="100%" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ex/ih/z-/exihz-diqt5bjn1hibjszexxeuq.png"><br clear="all"></p><p><img width="48" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gs/n-/bk/gsn-bkxiljmlo9ni_ap8thr9uhc.png">  There is another problem that people are dragging containers into their mouths from anywhere.  They often do not even know what is inside there.  It's one thing if you want to poke your wand on your laptop.  And another thing - to drag it in production.  And, unfortunately, many are pulling anything.  That is, you need something that is difficult to assemble, they take ready and well, if from the manufacturer who took care of and took the normal base containers.  And this is the vector to attack.  For example, we may soon find a new wave of containers of the same name, as was the case with peep modules, with het modules.  As with domains, everything is the same.  That is, this is not a new problem, it is still the same old one.  And when a service becomes a commodity, when it spreads like this - people come there who punish those who do not follow security.  By the way, because of this, we have a lot of reports about security. <img width="100%" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ck/o4/j9/cko4j9qh7prmqrdydtjin0npsty.png"><br clear="all"></p><p><img width="48" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8e/ky/kz/8ekykzda9qgrzcubfisv7pi2mdm.png">  And what else is there? <img width="100%" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/k9/kx/3f/k9kx3f08geskm6oqgvhb0g_8u0w.png"><br clear="all"></p><p><img width="48" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gs/n-/bk/gsn-bkxiljmlo9ni_ap8thr9uhc.png">  We still have a secret management solution from Seth Vargo.  By the way, there will be a security roundtable with him. <img width="100%" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ck/o4/j9/cko4j9qh7prmqrdydtjin0npsty.png"><br clear="all"></p><p><img width="48" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8e/ky/kz/8ekykzda9qgrzcubfisv7pi2mdm.png">  Is Seth the same person from Google who used to work at HashiCorp? <img width="100%" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/k9/kx/3f/k9kx3f08geskm6oqgvhb0g_8u0w.png"><br clear="all"></p><p><img width="48" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gs/n-/bk/gsn-bkxiljmlo9ni_ap8thr9uhc.png">  Before that, he worked at Chef Software and was a star there when Chef was at the peak of popularity.  He left a mark on almost every cookbook.  Even some people disliked him for this activity.  Then he inherited a lot in HashiCorp.  And this trail HashiCorp behind him still stretches.  Here he will talk about the product HashiCorp.  About Google, he will not tell.  But in the title he will have Google, so it adds weight. <img width="100%" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ck/o4/j9/cko4j9qh7prmqrdydtjin0npsty.png"><br clear="all"></p><p><img width="48" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8e/ky/kz/8ekykzda9qgrzcubfisv7pi2mdm.png">  By the way, what happened to Chef? <img width="100%" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/k9/kx/3f/k9kx3f08geskm6oqgvhb0g_8u0w.png"><br clear="all"></p><p><img width="48" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hv/gb/eh/hvgbehlaaxry8zosvn8wra3-16e.jpeg">  In some places, Chef was killed by those very containers. <img width="100%" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ex/ih/z-/exihz-diqt5bjn1hibjszexxeuq.png"><br clear="all"></p><p><img width="48" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/za/xu/g3/zaxug3symhuviekalpytlb5efbu.png">  Chef applications where they were written and work - as far as I understand, they can continue to work for a long time, because configuration management itself has not died. <img width="100%" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bh/tb/ad/bhtbadr2-ts3l1zwpgkduprh_ww.png"><br clear="all"></p><p><img width="48" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gs/n-/bk/gsn-bkxiljmlo9ni_ap8thr9uhc.png">  Guys, I can tell you by a live example.  We have something that is not in docker, then under the Chief.

What is not under the docker, then under the Chief.

Here they will still live for some time with Chef, because everyone who has been in the normal world does not want to return to the manual control room. <img width="100%" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ck/o4/j9/cko4j9qh7prmqrdydtjin0npsty.png"><br clear="all"></p><p><img width="48" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8e/ky/kz/8ekykzda9qgrzcubfisv7pi2mdm.png">  By the way, does Ansible use any of those present? <img width="100%" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/k9/kx/3f/k9kx3f08geskm6oqgvhb0g_8u0w.png"><br clear="all"></p><p><img width="48" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gs/n-/bk/gsn-bkxiljmlo9ni_ap8thr9uhc.png">  Yes, Ansible too. <img width="100%" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ck/o4/j9/cko4j9qh7prmqrdydtjin0npsty.png"><br clear="all"></p><p><img width="48" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/za/xu/g3/zaxug3symhuviekalpytlb5efbu.png">  We use. <img width="100%" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bh/tb/ad/bhtbadr2-ts3l1zwpgkduprh_ww.png"><br clear="all"></p><p><img width="48" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8e/ky/kz/8ekykzda9qgrzcubfisv7pi2mdm.png">  And How?

In each API region, the entry point is different, and Terraform as if you are talking about one.  That is, you need to resolve these entry points in the description, describe each vpc and another peering, the connection between these vpc in different regions.

TeamCity DSL has become available to use.  See what the problem was before the latest version.  In the previous version, if you switched to Kotlin DSL, you did not have the option to continue using the interface.  As soon as you stepped over the line, the only way to write further was only on Kotlin. <img width="100%" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ck/o4/j9/cko4j9qh7prmqrdydtjin0npsty.png"><br clear="all"></p><p><img width="48" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hv/gb/eh/hvgbehlaaxry8zosvn8wra3-16e.jpeg">  Everything, you stepped on the Dark Side. <img width="100%" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ex/ih/z-/exihz-diqt5bjn1hibjszexxeuq.png"><br clear="all"></p><p><img width="48" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gs/n-/bk/gsn-bkxiljmlo9ni_ap8thr9uhc.png">  Yes, the documentation was at a minimum, and it was adok.  Therefore, we tried and rolled back immediately to the XML configuration.  In the latest version, when you switch to Kotlin DSL, you continue to use the web interface, and it patches it under the hood, patches these structures right in the repository.  Then you can safely continue to write on Kotlin, if you have already mastered something somewhere.  Those who are not yet dedicated, can continue to poke in the interface.

Sometimes less, sometimes more.  From some reports we took something good for ourselves.  <a href="https://devoops.ru/2018/spb/talks/1xugh7edoymkmwegye0mks/">Especially the one that is associated with Ansible</a> , which has already been mentioned.  We also have Ansible, and we also started to cook it incorrectly.  It is interesting to listen to the <a href="https://devoops.ru/2018/spb/talks/wnrujyuzooqiyeaswyma2/">report of Oksana</a> , because I work in a department that does something similar.  But we have a slightly different orientation: as far as she understood, Oksana‚Äôs department deals with those who came to them and those whom business requires.  Our department, on the contrary, is trying to process everyone who is in the company. <img width="100%" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qd/rn/hw/qdrnhwkxmujscqftpo9hii53on8.png"><br clear="all"></p><p><img width="48" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/za/xu/g3/zaxug3symhuviekalpytlb5efbu.png">  Actually, no, I work in the same department, he is in the same positions with us.

Vladimir Borodin talks about <a href="https://devoops.ru/2018/spb/talks/mvvwgsonl2coe68mauk6g/">the database in the clouds</a> .  By the way, on cloud technologies, this is probably the only report we have. <img width="100%" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bh/tb/ad/bhtbadr2-ts3l1zwpgkduprh_ww.png"><br clear="all"></p><p><img width="48" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/4o/xl/d_/4oxld_saogyzsre56tgjku7bvpm.png">  Report on stateful in the cloud, and it is such a game-game that no one can do. <img width="100%" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/m6/kw/pz/m6kwpzhucz4wj-zsjg-vjmtztqy.png"><br clear="all"></p><p><img width="48" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gs/n-/bk/gsn-bkxiljmlo9ni_ap8thr9uhc.png">  Nobody wants to do this, because nobody wants to potentially lose data.  And so the emergence of such a managed PostgreSQL in Russia ... Under the conditions that many services simply had to move to Russia some time ago to be allowed to work further - the appearance of such a service closes the last element of the puzzle.  If there were a lot of clouds in Russia, then reliable storages that can be trusted are not easy to name. <img width="100%" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ck/o4/j9/cko4j9qh7prmqrdydtjin0npsty.png"><br clear="all"></p><p><img width="48" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8e/ky/kz/8ekykzda9qgrzcubfisv7pi2mdm.png">  Baruch, you constantly listen to something, tell.

I‚Äôm very interested in Kubernetes pacing the planet, I‚Äôm very interested in the docker's consumerization, these are very cool things.  And, of course, I, too, as one of the less technically savvy and less hardcore-oriented representatives of the program committee, really tried so that we would not avoid the theme of culture and the proper construction of processes. <img width="100%" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ex/ih/z-/exihz-diqt5bjn1hibjszexxeuq.png"><br clear="all"></p><p><img width="48" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8e/ky/kz/8ekykzda9qgrzcubfisv7pi2mdm.png">  The time allocated for the meeting is rapidly approaching the end, and it is time to sum up.  Can you wish something to those who are reading it now?  Any final thoughts, any reports worth looking at first? <img width="100%" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/k9/kx/3f/k9kx3f08geskm6oqgvhb0g_8u0w.png"><br clear="all"></p><p><img width="48" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hv/gb/eh/hvgbehlaaxry8zosvn8wra3-16e.jpeg">  A very simple way to join the great is to hang on the live broadcast of the first hall.  Naturally, the suitability will be not only in the first hall, respectively, it makes sense to look at other reports too.  But it seems to me that the main difference between viewing reports (including broadcasting - no matter, free or paid) from the conference hike is all that is happening between them.  JUG.ru Group is famous for the activities that take place on the court outside the room where the report takes place.  This is communication with the speakers in the discussion areas, and any meat that we have prepared after the closing of the conference.  There we have a lot of interesting things.  We will have round tables, discussion boughs (BOF).  About such patient topics, for example, how devops differ from SRE.  There are technical reports about security, but there is a much more global problem - what can we do about it, because, as I said, none of us are specialists, and we all have to do this.  In addition, any fan, for example, will be a karaoke-battle in which everyone can participate, a geeky party - as expected, everyone will stand in the corners, drink and be silent :-) <img width="100%" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ex/ih/z-/exihz-diqt5bjn1hibjszexxeuq.png"><br clear="all"></p><p><img width="48" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8e/ky/kz/8ekykzda9qgrzcubfisv7pi2mdm.png">  All those present here will be able to meet or someone will not go? <img width="100%" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/k9/kx/3f/k9kx3f08geskm6oqgvhb0g_8u0w.png"><br clear="all"></p><p><img width="48" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dw/uj/yz/dwujyz-bfhuzwow-ysymznzghkc.jpeg">  Most likely, I definitely will not. <img width="100%" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0s/ol/zl/0solzl-uukdf1yxvitnpzcrtw4s.png"><br clear="all"></p><p><img width="48" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hv/gb/eh/hvgbehlaaxry8zosvn8wra3-16e.jpeg">  ‚ÄúMost likely, precisely, with high probability‚Äù - this is wonderful, I think. <img width="100%" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ex/ih/z-/exihz-diqt5bjn1hibjszexxeuq.png"><br clear="all"></p><p><img width="48" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/4o/xl/d_/4oxld_saogyzsre56tgjku7bvpm.png">  Still saw this picture? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/og/tm/ex/ogtmexgyzpmfe9k5u37ugw_bp4u.png"><img width="100%" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/m6/kw/pz/m6kwpzhucz4wj-zsjg-vjmtztqy.png"><br clear="all"></p><p><img width="48" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hv/gb/eh/hvgbehlaaxry8zosvn8wra3-16e.jpeg">  Yes, all these words vary depending on the culture of the country in which it is all pronounced.

Here, most likely, bos will be bofs, in which everyone can participate and say something. <img width="100%" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/k9/kx/3f/k9kx3f08geskm6oqgvhb0g_8u0w.png"><br clear="all"></p><p><img width="48" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hv/gb/eh/hvgbehlaaxry8zosvn8wra3-16e.jpeg">  This is not about the guts of the JVM, but about the fact that some speakers do not use the bof format to make a report out of it.  We, as a program committee, will do everything we can to prevent this from happening. <img width="100%" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ex/ih/z-/exihz-diqt5bjn1hibjszexxeuq.png"><br clear="all"></p><p><img width="48" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/4o/xl/d_/4oxld_saogyzsre56tgjku7bvpm.png">  The idea is that devops are processes, and this is exactly what you need to grind on the sidelines.  It seems to me that this should be directly emphasized. <img width="100%" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/m6/kw/pz/m6kwpzhucz4wj-zsjg-vjmtztqy.png"><br clear="all"></p><p><img width="48" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hv/gb/eh/hvgbehlaaxry8zosvn8wra3-16e.jpeg">  All right, great remark.  For DevOops, chatting on the sidelines is even more important than for all other conferences.  I totally agree with you here.  Just because here are the people + processes, the reports are much worse than the discussion zones, bafs and everything else. <img width="100%" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ex/ih/z-/exihz-diqt5bjn1hibjszexxeuq.png"><br clear="all"></p><p><img width="48" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dw/uj/yz/dwujyz-bfhuzwow-ysymznzghkc.jpeg">  It probably makes sense to emphasize this, because I looked at the same <a href="https://techtrain.ru/talks/3pan1rregsqw6goosmgqau/">Artem Kalichkin</a> on TechTrain, and the discussion area was comparable in intensity to the report itself. <img width="100%" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0s/ol/zl/0solzl-uukdf1yxvitnpzcrtw4s.png"><br clear="all"></p><p><img width="48" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/za/xu/g3/zaxug3symhuviekalpytlb5efbu.png">  I agree, I was also in this discussion area.  There, after the report, maybe it was even more interesting than what he was broadcasting to the audience.  But what he told on TechTrain, here we would not go down much.  It should be understood that the TechTrain audience was completely different.  This is a new format for the JUG.ru Group, this is not a conference - this is a festival.  There was a lot of mixed stuff there, it was very cool.  I was there both days, and everything was very interesting and good.  There were reports, but many of them were light, to a youth audience, in order to interest and provoke a discussion. <img width="100%" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bh/tb/ad/bhtbadr2-ts3l1zwpgkduprh_ww.png"><br clear="all"></p><p><img width="48" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8e/ky/kz/8ekykzda9qgrzcubfisv7pi2mdm.png">  It would make sense that the discussion can begin with a short report, and then the whole Expoforum space is your ‚Äúdiscussion zone‚Äù (if we speak in terms of our conferences). <img width="100%" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/k9/kx/3f/k9kx3f08geskm6oqgvhb0g_8u0w.png"><br clear="all"></p><p><img width="48" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/za/xu/g3/zaxug3symhuviekalpytlb5efbu.png">  Yes, it was.  There were also light-reports in the areas next to the stands for literally twenty minutes, after which, too, I happened to witness a report about how a person wrote Bach chorals.  We discussed it with him for half an hour - he was just unlucky that I was passing by. <img width="100%" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bh/tb/ad/bhtbadr2-ts3l1zwpgkduprh_ww.png"><br clear="all"></p><p><img width="48" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8e/ky/kz/8ekykzda9qgrzcubfisv7pi2mdm.png">  Invite him to DevOops next time! <img width="100%" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/k9/kx/3f/k9kx3f08geskm6oqgvhb0g_8u0w.png"><br clear="all"></p><p><img width="48" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/za/xu/g3/zaxug3symhuviekalpytlb5efbu.png">  Rather, he should be invited to Joker, because he wrote to Java.
