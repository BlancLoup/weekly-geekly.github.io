      Users <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2018/jul/05/what-should-i-do-about-all-the-gdpr-pop-ups-on-websites">try to hide banners as soon as possible</a> , as they interfere with viewing the content of the site and ‚Äúdestroy‚Äù UX in mobile versions of Internet resources.  Residents of Reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/web_design/comments/93o0eg/cookie_policy_notifications_have_ruined_user/">state</a> : "Cookie notifications are the worst thing that happened with web services after Internet Explorer." <br><br>  For companies and website owners, cookies-banners <a href="https://medium.com/%40bratsun/how-to-fix-gdpr-disaster-of-endless-cookie-consents-b6a878110aad">also became a headache</a> , as they had to spend the budget (to pay developers and designers) to create pop-up windows that nobody likes. <br><br><h2>  What is written in the law </h2><br>  Cookies began to appear after the ePrivacy directive, adopted by the European Union in 2009, came into force (now they want to toughen it, we wrote more about this <a href="https://habr.com/company/1cloud/blog/432452/">in one of the past materials</a> ).  The emergence of the GDPR and heavy fines for non-compliance with its requirements exacerbated the situation - banners began to show all sites operating in the European market. <br><br><blockquote>  But there is an interesting nuance: according to ePrivacy Directive and GDPR, banners are completely optional. </blockquote><br>  The text of the GDPR specifically about banners does not say anything.  The only thing in <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/%3Fqid%3D1528874672298%26uri%3DCELEX%25253A32016R0679">paragraph 30 of the law</a> says that the site is obliged to notify the user about the installation of cookies, if they can be used to determine the identity of a person.  You can not get the consent of the user, if cookies are needed only for saving session data, playing video and audio content, load balancing on the site and the work of third-party plug-ins that allow sharing content in social networks. <br><br>  As for the ePrivacy Directive ( <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do%3Furi%3DOJ:L:2009:337:0011:0036:en:PDF">PDF</a> ), it also obliges site owners to notify users about the processing of cookies, but only if they are related to analytics and marketing campaigns.  However, nothing is said about the form of these notifications. <br><br><blockquote>  <i>‚ÄúThus, site owners themselves are responsible for implementing the requirements of the GDPR and ePrivacy Directive,‚Äù commented Sergey Belkin, head of the IaaS-service development department at <a href="https://1cloud.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Dcpm%26utm_campaign%3Dcookies%26utm_content%3Dsite">1cloud.ru</a> .</i>  <i>‚ÄúBanners were chosen as the easiest and to some extent obvious way to keep the law.‚Äù</i> </blockquote><br><h2>  Is it possible to do without banners </h2><br>  Since the law does not oblige the use of banners, and they are all fed up, alternative solutions are now being developed that would simplify the lives of people.  However, so far they have not gained widespread or great popularity. <br><br><h5>  EU initiative </h5><br>  In 2017, the European Commission <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/11/14238348/proposed-eu-law-ban-cookie-banners-online-tracking">proposed a</a> new law.  At the legislative level, it will have to approve the mechanism for automatic processing of cookie banners.  The idea is to give users the opportunity to specify in the browser settings whether resources are allowed on the network to set optional cookies.  Users and site owners immediately supported the bill, but there were representatives of the IT industry, who did not like this decision. <br><br>  Against the initiative were companies operating in the advertising field.  They say that the law will deal a serious blow to the marketing and online marketing industry.  According to their estimates, the revenue from targeted online advertising will be halved.  If we consider that in 2018 global advertising costs in the network <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/emarketer-total-media-ad-spending-worldwide-will-rise-7-4-in-2018">amounted to</a> 630 billion dollars, the damage will be noticeable. <br><br>  Also, critics of the law believe that the new rules will annoy people even more than pop-up cookies.  Users <a href="http://www.iabeurope.eu/policy/press-release-proposed-eprivacy-regulation-fails-to-improve-cookie-rules/">will have to</a> change browser settings on all devices.  In this case, the owners of Internet resources can always add all the same banners, only now with a request to activate the collection of cookies in the browser. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zv/tu/2l/zvtu2l1hbqlm3bjrf5ytvny5yow.jpeg"><br>  <font color="#A9A9A9"><i>/ Flickr / <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/44563197%40N00/5320820938/">calebdcochran</a> / <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">CC BY</a></i></font> <br><br>  Due to the ambiguous reaction of the community, the bill has so far been postponed.  Industry representatives <a href="http://www.iabeurope.eu/policy/press-release-proposed-eprivacy-regulation-fails-to-improve-cookie-rules/">point</a> out that the law has no future without amending. <br><br><h5>  DNT framework </h5><br>  Another solution to the situation with banners is the Tracking Protection Expression framework (or <a href="https://allaboutdnt.com/">Do Not Track, DNT</a> ).  It was first <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2010/12/ftc-staff-issues-privacy-report-offers-framework-consumers">presented</a> by the Federal Trade Commission ( <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">FTC</a> ) in 2010.  The principle of its operation is similar to the mechanism proposed by the European Commission.  DNT adds to browsers a function that tells the websites whether the user has allowed the installation of cookies or not. <br><br>  A couple of years ago, the World Wide Web Consortium ( <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D1%2583%25D0%25BC_%25D0%2592%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B0%25D1%2583%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B">W3C</a> ), which develops and implements Internet standards, developed <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2016/CR-tracking-compliance-20160426/">recommendations</a> for website owners on using the framework with regard to the requirements of the GDPR. <br><br><blockquote>  The development of DNT is still underway, but the first experimental studies from Forrester analysts show that it <a href="https://gizmodo.com/do-not-track-the-privacy-tool-used-by-millions-of-peop-1828868324">does not work</a> .  Popular resources ignore DNT and continue to comply with internal security policies.  At the same time, the framework again encountered the resistance of marketing services and companies whose business depends on targeted advertising. </blockquote><br>  The DNT is not widespread, even among those who initially supported it.  For example, Mozilla, due to the fact that the framework and new standards were not introduced by other market players, the company <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/futurereleases/2018/08/30/changing-our-approach-to-anti-tracking/">introduced its own tools</a> .  The developers have added a feature to <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Nightly">Firefox</a> that allows a person to choose which PDs the site will receive and which will not. <br><br><h5>  You can refuse cookies </h5><br>  As we have already said, sites that do not collect cookies for targeted advertising do not need to receive user consent.  Therefore, Internet resources have the opportunity not to show pop-up banners to users at all. <br><br>  In <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/">USA Today</a> , for example, they dispense with notifications about the collection of cookies, which makes it possible to further optimize the weight of the start page.  In addition, without advertisements page looks "clean" and neat. <br><br>  Another such option will fit for personal blogs.  One Belgian backend developer, using the <a href="https://laravel.com/">Laravel framework,</a> saved <a href="https://dieterstinglhamber.me/">his website</a> from cookies and even gave <a href="https://dieterstinglhamber.me/join-the-light-side-we-have-no-cookies">detailed instructions</a> on how to do this on other sites. <br><br>  As a result, the situation is as follows.  Nobody likes banners, but for the time being they are massively used to comply with the requirements of the law.  Perhaps, when the European Commission makes amendments to its bill or the DNT framework will become more common, users will be relieved of annoying pop-up windows. <br><br><h5>  PS Materials on the topic from our corporate blog: </h5><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://1cloud.ru/blog/personalnye-dannye-chast-1%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Dcpm%26utm_campaign%3Dcookies%26utm_content%3Dblog">"About personal data": the essence of the FZ-152</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://1cloud.ru/blog/personalnye-dannye-chast-2%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Dcpm%26utm_campaign%3Dcookies%26utm_content%3Dblog">What will help protect personal data</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://1cloud.ru/blog/personalnye-dannye-chast-3%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Dcpm%26utm_campaign%3Dcookies%26utm_content%3Dblog">How to protect personal data in a public cloud</a> </li></ul><br><h5>  PPS What else do we write on Habr√©: </h5><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/company/1cloud/blog/433948/">How to make payment for services more convenient: the experience of an IaaS provider</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/company/1cloud/blog/430974/">Big photo tour of the Moscow cloud 1cloud</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/434006/">https://habr.com/ru/post/434006/</a></p>
