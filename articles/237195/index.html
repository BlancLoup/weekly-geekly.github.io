  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Samsung introduced the first secure tablet for enterprises GALAXY Tab Active</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good afternoon, Habr! <br><br>  Undoubtedly, among the new Samsung products presented at the IFA exhibition in early September, the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/samsung/blog/235693/">flagship smartphone GALAXY Note 4</a> and the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/samsung/blog/236069/">Samsung Gear VR virtual reality glasses</a> became the highlight of the program.  But there was another announcement, which was left practically unnoticed by the average audience: Samsung showed off its first tablet for B2B clients - the GALAXY Tab Active.  The new mobile device for enterprises has enhanced protection from external influences, additional functions, as well as enhanced security policies.  Details under the cut. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a3d/755/942/a3d7559423b54bce9fe53c878829b719.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Today, the secure device market has little to offer when it comes to tablets - there are no more than a dozen in nature.  The main problem here is a much more complex technological process, which most companies simply do not have.  The few manufacturers who are able to create a secure mobile device with a large screen diagonal face another problem: B2B niche is small and highly specialized, while prices for non-killed tablets are, on average, three times higher than for mass-market counterparts.  Under the circumstances, the release of the new GALAXY Tab Active device was an important milestone in the development of the B2B segment, since high functionality combined with a ruggedized design is exactly what modern enterprises have been waiting for and that the new tablet is just ready to provide. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ca8/3eb/acf/ca83ebacf7f9455d9096a9ad80a9f29d.jpg"><br>  In the process of developing GALAXY Tab Active, Samsung turned to future customers for help.  In order to understand the current challenges and requirements of modern business, the company attracted a consulting group that includes <a href="http://fortune.com/fortune500/">Fortune 500</a> companies to create a new tablet.  Experts from leading global companies allowed to better understand the specifics of such markets as retail, logistics and transport.  By combining the data of this study with its own analysis of key markets, Samsung was able to create a device that meets the needs of modern enterprises and designed to optimize business processes and improve employee productivity - the GALAXY Tab Active tablet. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/050/b95/1c0/050b951c05aa4776b7904bc2c87324b2.jpg"><br>  The tablet has been certified MIL-STD-810G - this can only boast a small number of similar devices.  Thanks to the anti-shock coating and durable protective cover, GALAXY Tab Active can withstand a fall from a height of up to 1.2 meters.  In addition, the device conforms to the IP67 standard, providing reliable protection from moisture and dust.  The tablet owner will not have to worry about the fact that if it falls, becomes dirty or gets into a humid environment, the device may be damaged or its operation may be impaired.  GALAXY Tab Active will become a reliable assistant in harsh field conditions - he is not afraid of the effects of heat, cold, dust or water, which is especially important for those who constantly work outside the office.  Officially stated that it can operate in the temperature range from -20 to +60 degrees Celsius. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1e2/a24/51a/1e2a2451a73d4f31a2e4ded9a73cf6fa.jpg"><br><br>  The tablet is equipped with an 8-inch WXGA (1280 √ó 800) TFT screen, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 quad-core chipset with a frequency of 1.2 GHz, 1.5 GB of RAM and 16 GB of internal memory, and a slot for microSD cards (up to 64 GB).  The operating system is Android KitKat (4.4), the interface is branded TouchWiz with improvements and additions.  A 3.1 megapixel autofocus camera helps with bar code scanning, and NFC near field communication will optimize workflows, saving a lot of time.  Interfaces: USB 2.0, Bluetooth 4.0 LE, Wi-Fi 802.11 a / b / g / n, (2.4 and 5 GHz), GPS and GLONASS are supported.  The dimensions of the protected Samsung are 213.1 √ó 126.2 √ó 9.75 mm, weight - 393 grams.

      GALAXY Tab Active is equipped with an electronic pen C-Pen, which will allow to use the device in situations where it is impossible to work with the screen with your fingers.  The pen will be a convenient tool for those professionals who need to wear protective gloves at work - for example, at a construction site.  In order not to lose it in the heat of the working day, the C-Pen is securely fastened to the protective case of the GALAXY Tab Active. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/198/c20/83b/198c2083bf3041ddb16c8dac8e19f42d.jpg"><br>  For professionals who are constantly working in an open area, on a construction site, or simply for a long time do not have access to electricity, for example, builders, engineers or utility workers, such quality as the energy-intensive battery of a mobile device is especially important.  GALAXY Tab Active provides 8-10 hours of continuous operation on one full charge, thanks to a 4450 mAh battery.  There is also a mode of maximum energy saving Ultra Power Saving Mode.  In addition, the tablet provides the ability to easily replace the battery.  Another important feature of the device is a separate POGO connector, which allows you to unload the often used microUSB connector and use it for other needs at the same time as charging the tablet. <br><br>  GALAXY Tab Active is equipped with Samsung KNOX security system, which ensures the safety of personal and corporate data.  This solution satisfies the high security requirements of the IT services of enterprises, does not prejudice the privacy of employees and eliminates the cost of a third-party security platform. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4fe/12a/e32/4fe12ae32cb74abbbecfaae54ef263c1.jpg"><br><br>  Samsung provides an extended warranty on the GALAXY Tab Active for up to three years.  It covers repair cases even with mechanical damage.  Understanding how important it is for companies to comply with the deadlines, regardless of device malfunctions, the company also provides users of the GALAXY Tab Active access to the Smart Tutor Service technical support service.  An employee of the Samsung service center is always ready to promptly assist and remotely solve the problems encountered - anytime and anywhere. <br><br>  Samsung GALAXY Tab Active will be available in two options: Wi-Fi or Wi-Fi + LTE.  The tablet in the color solution Titanium Green (titanium green), will be supplied with a protective cover and an electronic pen C-Pen.  The final price of the device in the domestic market has not yet been announced, but it is known for certain that it will be significantly below $ 1,000.  Whether this model will appear in retail in the near future is a big question, but Samsung receives many requests for the implementation of the tablet outside the B2B sector, which is why it is possible that the GALAXY Tab Active will still be available at network stores or operators (as happened with GALAXY).
