  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Laziness is the engine of progress.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Many of my friends in conversations complain that their laziness does not allow them to work, or they say that they are stupid ‚Äî it seems clear what to do, but the work is not going.  I will leave the issues of time management and willpower training beyond the scope of this post, and I will try to tell you what opportunities another laziness attack gives us.  Let's try to understand what we are most lazy to do?  Something new and interesting can not be the cause of our laziness.  But routine repetitive actions - completely.  Of course, laziness is harmful and you need to fight it, but you can benefit from even negative things.  I will give a couple of examples of how my own laziness made me a couple of favors: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  1) Once I worked as a system administrator in a company with a very confusing infrastructure (then we really disentangled it), when hiring a new user, it was necessary to register it in the domain, make an account on the mail server, create several folders under the profile, personal disk and still a bunch of routine operations.  It took time, almost an hour for one employee and terribly enraged me.  I decided to end this boring and pesky business.  After collecting beer and sowing after work for a VB script tutorial, I wrote a script in a few evenings, which connected via ODBC to the Excel file and created the necessary accounts.  The institution of the user has since occupied me no more than five minutes.  I freed a lot of time for more interesting and not boring things. <br><br>  By the way, you should not think that using your laziness for the good is possible only as an administrator, sometimes you can deal with paper work: <br><br>  2) As a head of technical support in one progressive insurance company, I among other things engaged in corporate mobile telephony.  Literally every week, what kind of stupid employee would be losing the phone and it was necessary to restore the SIM.  This process included the printing of an application for restoration, a trip to the MTS office, standing in line at the corporate department, receiving a SIM card and a trip back.  In total, spent 3-4 hours of working time.  All this terribly enraged me, and I decided to try, what to do.  Once again, when I needed to restore something, I talked to my manager at MTS, we discussed a bunch of non-work-related issues, and I begged the dealer package from her.  This is such a set of various blank SIM cards and a map comparing the number capacity and MTS switches with empty SIM cards.  After that, I restored the lost SIM cards for about 10 minutes. I looked at which switch a lost SIM card belonged to, took an empty one and wrote a letter to the MTS with a request to restore such a number to such a SIM card.  After 10 minutes, everything was usually working.

      This is how my own laziness not only gave me some free time, but also, paradoxically, helped the business I worked for. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.frolin.ru/2007/11/02/len-dvigatel-progressa/">www.frolin.ru/2007/11/02/len-dvigatel-progressa</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/15710/">https://habr.com/ru/post/15710/</a></p>
