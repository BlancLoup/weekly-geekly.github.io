  <section class="page js-page"><h1>XAML Hot Reload Preview for Xamarin.Forms has been released</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Last week at the Xamarin Developer Summit we announced the ‚ÄúHot Reload XAML for Xamarin.Forms‚Äù, which allows you to make changes to the XAML user interface and view them in real time without requiring another build and deployment. <br><br>  The XAML hot reload for Xamarin.Forms speeds development and simplifies building, experimenting, and iterating into the user interface.  And this means that you no longer need to rebuild your application every time you configure your user interface - all changes are instantly displayed in the running application. <br><br>  When your application is compiled using XAML Hot Reload, it works with all libraries and third-party controls.  This feature will be available for iOS and Android in Visual Studio 2019 and Visual Studio 2019 for Mac.  Everything works on all valid deployment targets, including simulators, emulators, and physical devices.

      The XAML hot reboot will be available later in 2019, but you can register for the preview: <br><br>  <b><a href="http://aka.ms/XAMLHotReload">Sign Up for the Preview Now</a></b> <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y3nGkzbc0JE&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700256,15700259,15700262&amp;usg=ALkJrhjDfla_ORhgQMaMBM1TvWcgX730jw"></iframe><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  What is supported? </h2><br>  XAML hot reload for Xamarin.Forms connects to an existing workflow to save you time and increase productivity.  Today, when you want to make changes to your XAML, you need to build, deploy, and debug again.  Now just save the XAML file and see how the changes are reflected in real time to the deployment goals, which allows you to spend less time on creating and deploying and more on creating mobile applications. <br><br>  You do not need to do anything special to use the Hot Reload;  There are no additional packages or code.  Create and deploy the application, as usual in Visual Studio or Visual Studio for Mac, on an iOS, Android emulator, simulator, or physical device.  Because XAML Hot Reload for Xamarin.Forms uses a debugger, not a network connection, it works reliably in complex corporate networks or in disconnected environments.  Edit your XAML and click "Save."  After the reboot, your navigation status will be saved.  If you use the MVVM pattern, the state of the user interface associated with your view model will remain unchanged during reboots. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/l9/wb/ph/l9wbphgpls4vr10-hzjrjkx0pn8.png"><br><br>  This new product also supports updates for all valid XAML types, including pages, Application, and Shell.  If you edit MyControl.xaml and save it, all pages referencing this control will be automatically updated according to the changes you made. <br><br>  XAML hot-booting resists typos and unsupported changes, such as IntelliSense quick actions.  Before you reload your changes, Visual Studio guarantees that the changes you made are valid.  If your edits contain invalid changes, this change will not be applied to your application, and the XAML editor will display the curves so that you know about it.  You can also check if the reboot was in the Output window in Visual Studio. <br><br>  It is important for us that the XAML Hot Reload for Xamarin.Forms works with all types of applications, regardless of complexity.  We have partnered with control providers and open source project developers such as Telerik, Infragistics, Grial UI Kit, Prism and Syncfusion so that you have no problem using XAML Hot Reload for Xamarin.Forms when working with these projects . <br><br><h2>  Focus on reviews </h2><br>  We conducted over 50 tests of various concepts with XAML Hot Reload developers for Xamarin.Forms to make sure that the concept will make your internal development cycle more productive.  We also partnered with several large Xamarin customers, Visual Studio partners, and MVP Xamarin to ensure that this experience meets your expectations.  Finally, we invited developers to our User Experience Lab in Seattle to use the XAML Hot Reload for Xamarin.Forms and verify that the experience was intuitive for all developers. <br><br><h2>  What's next? </h2><br>  In the private preview phase, we will continue to work on XAML Hot Boot to make sure that it meets your needs and exceeds the expectations that you place on items such as quality and performance.  When you tell us that it is ready, it will be embedded in a future release of Visual Studio and Visual Studio for Mac. <br><br>  In addition to achieving our quality and performance goals, the following points are also included in the XAML Hot Reload roadmap: <br><br><ul><li>  Incremental reboot: reload only controls or properties that have been changed. </li><li>  Simultaneous reloads: reload XAML for several debugged platforms simultaneously </li><li>  Improved condition monitoring: Improved UX for displaying "rough" edits or edits containing invalid changes to reload </li><li>  CSS: CSS style updates will be applied on reboot. </li></ul><br>  XAML is only the beginning of a hot reboot of Xamarin.  We will continue to focus our roadmap on the items that you think are most important to you.  In addition to targeting XAML, we continue to explore additional ways to increase your productivity when working in Visual Studio. <br><br><h2>  Join Preview </h2><br>  We invite you to register for a preview so you can try the XAML Hot Reload for Xamarin.Forms.  We will continue to take new developers to the preview-program in the weekly ‚Äúring‚Äù releases, ensuring that the reliability and performance of the product will be maintained as more developers try the Hot Restart.  Those who have been accepted into the private Preview can sometimes receive messages from our team asking for feedback;  we want the XAML Hot Reload for Xamarin.Forms to meet your expectations and reflect your priorities, so please take a few minutes to respond.  Your review will help Xamarin developers save countless hours in the future! <br><br>  If you have any questions, feel free to contact the XAML Hot Reload team for Xamarin.Forms at <a href="">hotreload-team@microsoft.com</a> . <br><br>  Have a nice reboot! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/459840/">https://habr.com/ru/post/459840/</a></p>
