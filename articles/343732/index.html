    <h3>  Mobility express </h3><br>  This functionality was dealt with in the article <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/cisco/blog/269137/">‚ÄúMobility Express - a new approach‚Äù</a> and represents the functionality of a wireless controller running on the hardware platform of one of the access points in the cluster. <br><br>  Since writing this article, the Mobility Express functionality has seriously evolved and today offers: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><ul><li>  The best-of-history Cisco dashboard is a control panel that allows you to get the parameters of network elements and client devices, network statistics ‚Äî the workload of access points, the behavior of client devices, the state of the radio.  Dashboard works in two modes - <b>expert</b> with the possibility of additional settings of radio parameters and a <b>simplified</b> version. </li><li>  Application Visibility &amp; Control (AVC) functionality - which allows you to determine the types of applications used in traffic and control them - to prohibit, prioritize or limit the speed; </li><li>  Supports up to 50 access points in a Mobility Express cluster on points of the 1815, 1830, 1850 series and up to 100 access points on the flagships of the line; </li><li>  Transfer of the cluster under the control of a separate wireless controller with one click of the mouse as the network grows. </li></ul><br>  An important advantage of Mobility Express is that this functionality can be used with access points of the previous generation.  Adding a single point of Mobility Express to such a wireless network allows you to cluster them and take advantage of the wireless controller without physically having it: <br><br><ul><li>  Radio Resource Management - automatic and regular planning of radio characteristics of an access point, such as a radio channel, radiation power and channel width.  Manual radio planning requires expertise, takes a lot of time and cannot dynamically respond to changes in the radio environment.  However, it is this functionality that is essential for good Wi-Fi coverage. </li><li>  Managed guest access in the form of a lobby ambassador account for a person who, in a convenient interface, generates disposable accounts for guests. </li><li>  Ease of starting and operating the network.  The setup wizard reduces the network launch time to several minutes and uses the parameters from the manufacturer's best practices for the best result.  The launch and operation of the network can be carried out directly from a mobile device thanks to the Cisco Wireless application available for iOS and Android. </li></ul><br>  Mobility Express is not licensed separately, <b>entering the price of the access point</b> . <br><br>  When the network grows beyond the Mobility Express cluster, the entire wireless network can be brought under the control of a separate wireless controller.  It will bring increased network performance, scalability, and a full set of Cisco corporate functionality ‚Äî fine radio settings, traffic analysis and segmentation. <br><br><h3>  Wi-Fi </h3><br>  Cisco Aironet 1815 Series access points operate in the 802.11ac Wave 2 standard, allowing you to take advantage of the savings in battery power of mobile devices and increased performance per access point with MU-MIMO.  MU-MIMO in a modern environment can improve the overall performance of the network, in which a large proportion of client devices are smartphones.  MU-MIMO allows you to send data streams simultaneously to multiple devices, forming an individual radiation pattern to each of them at one time. <br><br><h3>  And besides Wi-Fi? </h3><br>  Recently, the use of <b>BLE radio beacons</b> for indoor navigation service and personalized messaging (proximity messaging) has become popular.  Cisco Aironet Series 1815 Series Access Points have an integrated BLE beacon, which saves on the number of beacons when implementing an integrated solution.  Such a built-in beacon has no drawback in the form of a discharging battery, the frequency and signal strength are stable throughout the life cycle - which is important for the navigation service. <br><br>  My colleague recently reviewed the article <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/cisco/blog/340576">Why IT and Business Network Factory ... the</a> advantages and features of the new <b>Cisco Software Defined Access</b> architecture.  The advantages of SDA are available when building a network at the points of the 1815 series - managing the network from the DNA Center, collecting telemetry about the state of the radio network from access point sensors, etc ... <br><br>  A collection of analytics on customer presence ( <b>Cisco CMX</b> solution) and <b>benefits for iOS devices</b> as a result of Apple-Cisco technology partnership ( <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/cisco/blog/312828">Cisco and Apple Partnership ...</a> ) will also be available. <br><br><br><h3>  Which Aironet 1815 Series Access Point is Right for You? </h3><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ss/no/iv/ssnoivmszz1rfyil512stnlgdm0.jpeg"><br>  The 1815i, the most widely used ceiling mount option, is the most convenient option for covering a vast room. <br><br><img align="right" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hl/c4/tp/hlc4tp7xiwahbbnbyby9hdnj0sa.jpeg"><br>  1815w is a wall mount version, most popular for residential areas such as hotel rooms, dormitories, etc.  Wall mounting implies an appropriate radio signal pattern optimized for this type of installation.  The point has 3 local Gigabit Ethernet ports and a total bandwidth in uplink of 1 Gb / s, which allows you to connect several devices - TV, telephone, printer. <br><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pd/2d/h2/pd2dh2jjsyhnsues3o3f9y4b5_c.jpeg"><br>  1815t is an option for a remote worker, the main feature of which is the ability to automatically route the encrypted DTLS channel to the home corporate network.  At the same time, a ‚Äúguest network‚Äù is provided for home users, family members who do not use access to the corporate segment.  Point has 3 local Gigabit Ethernet ports for connecting home devices, such as a telephone, a printer.  The ideal installation option is desktop.  Due to its narrow use as a corporate network take-off, it does not need Mobility Express and does not support it. <br><br>  At cisco.com you can find a description of another sister of this family - 1815m - this point has an increased radiation power, which does not coincide with the vision of the RF SCRF on the use of radio resource, therefore we do not offer this point in the Russian Federation. <br><br>  <b>Materials</b> <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="https://engage2demand.cisco.com/ru-mobility-express%3FPOSITION%3Dpartnernewsletter%26COUNTRY_SITE%3Dru%26CAMPAIGN%3DEN-05_MobilityExpress%26REFERRING_SITE%3Dpartners%26CCID%3Dcc000048%26DTID%3Doemzzz000186%26OID%3Dwbrew003044">Cisco Mobility Express Webinar</a> <br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/global/ru_ru/about/brochures/assets/pdfs/1815w.pdf">Cisco Aironet 1815w Series Access Points Data Sheet</a> <br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/global/ru_ru/about/brochures/assets/pdfs/1815t_datasheet.pdf">Cisco Aironet 1815t Series Access Points Data Sheet</a> <br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/global/ru_ru/about/brochures/assets/pdfs/datasheet-c78-738243_en.pdf">Cisco Aironet 1815i Series Access Points Data Sheet</a> <br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/global/ru_ru/about/brochures/assets/pdfs/cisco_dna_mobility_express_solution.pdf">Cisco Mobiliy Express datasheet</a> <br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/ru_ru/solutions/enterprise-networks/mobility-express/index.html%3F">Mobility Express on cisco.com</a> <br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DHtpF9QNzkXM">Mobility Express video</a> <br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D5-Boa1Q4GhA%26feature%3Dyoutu.be">Unpacking 1815</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/343732/">https://habr.com/ru/post/343732/</a></p>
