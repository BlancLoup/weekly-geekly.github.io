Zharov reported that Telegram degradation is 30%</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kw/df/en/kwdfenangrta00pvm-a1qvvhct0.png"><br>  <i><font color="gray">As of 21:30, there are 16 291 540 blocked IP addresses in the unloading of vigruzki.rkn.gov.ru (81.177.103.92), the <a href="https://2018.schors.spb.ru/">source</a></font></i> <br><br>  On April 16, 2018, Roskomnadzor <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/300033/">launched an unprecedented campaign to massively block IP addresses</a> used by Telegram.  On April 17, the blockage reached such proportions that this day will undoubtedly go down in the history of the Runet. <br><br>  As of 16:37, Roskomnadzor included <b>18 192 074 IP addresses</b> in the registry, mainly from Google and Amazon subnets, including 52.0.0.0/11, 34.192.0.0/10 (4.19 million addresses), 52.192.0.0/ 11 and others.  By the end of the day, some of the addresses were excluded from the registry, so the number of blocked addresses <a href="https://2018.schors.spb.ru/">decreased to 16.3 million</a> , which is 0.38% of the IPv4 address space.

      The head of Roskomnadzor, Alexander Zharov, <a href="https://thebell.io/glava-roskomnadzora-telegram-zablokirovan-na-30/">said</a> that as a result of the blocking, ‚ÄúTelegram degradation is now 30%.‚Äù <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Zharov did not explain what is meant by the word ‚Äúdegradation‚Äù, but there is an opinion that the figure of 30% should look solid for a report to the boss.  It gives grounds for the continuation of the ‚Äúfan lock‚Äù, although dozens of third-party services have already suffered from the inclusion of millions of IP addresses, which have nothing to do with Telegram. <br><br>  Moreover, de facto at the moment, the damage to third-party services is much more serious than the damage to Telegram itself.  By the evening, there were <a href="https://t.me/cybervalhalla/2637">reports</a> <a href="https://t.me/cybervalhalla/2641">of problems</a> accessing the Battle.net platform, Xbox Live, the Netflix online cinema, the Twitch.tv streaming service, the Nintendo Switch prefix store, the Elite: Dangerous online game, and the anonymous search engine DuckDuckGo.  Interruptions in the work of Ivideon, a company providing video surveillance services for clients such as Rosneft, Rostelecom, Megafon, Google, DHL, Morton, and PIK, are noted. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f35/eca/736/f35eca736772f4f21d11242d1cc181e0.gif"></div><br><br>  Difficulties with access appeared to users of the social network "Odnoklassniki" ( <a href="http://downdetector.ru/ne-rabotaet/odnoklassniki/karta/">card failure</a> )  According to Vedomosti, <a href="https://www.vedomosti.ru/technology/articles/2018/04/17/766923-kto-postradal">nine online stores turned</a> to the National Association of Distance Trading (NADT) with a problem due to the blocking of Amazon servers.  Entrepreneurs say they are afraid to sue Roskomnadzor because of losses and possible "accusations of extremism." <br><br>  Finally, the <a href="http://tass.ru/ekonomika/5134473">site of Roskomnadzor itself fell</a> under a DDoS attack. <br><br>  Even the Russian Foreign Ministry expressed its discontent with the fan blocking: ‚ÄúOn the one hand, I am against closing and even more so how it is carried out - without a detailed explanation of what is happening, and [explanation] of Telegram‚Äôs motivation,‚Äù said department spokeswoman Maria Zakharova in <a href="https://tvrain.ru/teleshow/here_and_now/marija_zaharova-462027/">comments to the</a> TV channel "Rain".  She added that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs wants to receive instructions from Roskomnadzor about what to do with the two telegram channels of the department in the Telegram. <br><br>  The Kremlin <a href="http://tass.ru/obschestvo/5133683">supports the actions of Roskomnadzor</a> : ‚ÄúThe blocking will continue until the necessary conditions are fulfilled,‚Äù said presidential press secretary Dmitry Peskov, although he continued to use Telegram on April 17, like <a href="https://tjournal.ru/69324-govorit-moskva-chinovniki-prodolzhili-polzovatsya-telegram-posle-blokirovki">other officials</a> . <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4c7/c65/8b7/4c7c658b7f45a333b61a2f8482b10126.jpg"></div><br><br>  It is unlikely that Pavel Durov is going to fulfill the set conditions.  Today, he <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/300051/">announced</a> the creation of the Digital Resistance Movement and the payment of Bitcoin grants to administrators of proxies and VPN services: <img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_u/2a/5t/_u2a5tw8uzwvylq149gsric5vlm.png" align="left">  ‚ÄúDuring this year I will be glad to donate millions of dollars in personal funds for these purposes.  I urge everyone to join and participate - setting up proxy / vpn servers or financing them, ‚Äùwrote Durov.  According to Alexander Lyamina from Qrator Labs, Pavel Durov now loses about $ 1 million per day because of the blockage. <br><br>  Thus, it can be expected that tomorrow the scale of the lock will not decrease.  Apparently, Roskomnadzor intends to continue in the register new ranges of IP addresses, as well as take measures against companies owning VPN and proxy services: ‚ÄúRoskomnadzor takes and will take all necessary measures to implement the court‚Äôs decision, including those related to restricting access to Internet resources that facilitate the functioning of the services of the company Telegram Messenger Limited Liability Parhnership, ‚Äùthe press service said. <br><br>  The ministry stressed that the duty to stop the work of the messenger is imposed by a court decision not only on Roskomnadzor, but also on companies that own VPN and proxy services.  Access is restricted until the company fulfills the established obligation to provide the FSB with the information necessary to decode the received, transmitted, delivered and processed electronic messages, ‚Äùthe press service <a href="http://www.interfax.ru/russia/608862">informed</a> . <br><br>  At the same time, Roskomnadzor set about blocking IP addresses through which Telegram sends push messages to its users to change the proxy settings in the program: ‚ÄúWe are aware of this technology, its IP addresses have been identified.  We are currently developing a technical solution for this blocking bypass technology, ‚Äù <a href="https://russian.rt.com/russia/article/504321-glava-roskomnadzora-o-blokirovke-telegram">said</a> Zharov. <br><br>  To ‚Äúfight against unreliable information‚Äù, Roskomnadzor today opened a ‚Äúhot line‚Äù on blocking - email address <i>Hotlinerkn@rkn.gov.ru</i> .  "In the Internet published inaccurate information about the alleged blocking of bona fide online resources," - said in a press release.  Roskomnadzor proposes to report such facts: ‚ÄúReceived messages will be checked, if necessary, a public response will follow.‚Äù  Alexander Zharov <a href="https://thebell.io/glava-roskomnadzora-telegram-zablokirovan-na-30/">said</a> that claims from online services affected by the fan-blocking of IP addresses are getting a little. <br><br>  The human rights group Agora also <a href="https://t.me/pchikov/1023">opened a</a> blocking <a href="https://t.me/pchikov/1023">hotline</a> .  If you are threatened with blocking or are already blocking, write to the lawyer Damir Gainutdinov by mail (damir51@gmail.com), to Telegram / Twitter ( <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/snorri51/" class="user_link">snorri51</a> ) or <a href="">to Facebook</a> .  On the first day, <a href="https://meduza.io/news/2018/04/17/k-yuristam-agory-za-pomoschyu-iz-za-blokirovok-obratilis-predstaviteli-okolo-60-kompaniy">over 60 companies</a> applied for help. <br><br>  Today, the representative of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), Rupert Colville, <a href="https://ria.ru/world/20180417/1518857549.html">stated violations committed in blocking the Telegram</a> : ‚ÄúBlocking the Telegram message service for everyone in Russia because of the proceedings against six individuals [because the FSB demanded encryption keys - approx.  Ed.] is quite obviously an exceptionally disproportionate response, he said.  - Discussions around encryption are unduly focused on one side of the security coin, in particular, its potential to be used for criminal purposes in times of terrorism.  The other side of this coin is that, by weakening encryption protection, you can create a greater threat to national and international security. ‚Äù <br><br><blockquote>  <b>Note:</b> When commenting on this material, please follow the rules of Geektimes.
