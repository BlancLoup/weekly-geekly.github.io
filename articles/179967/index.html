  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Motivation of people and animals - inside view</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  If you constantly do not think about the cause of your own actions or actions of subordinates - do not read this post, drink a blue pill with vodka (or vodka) and sleep further. <br>  In the article I want to present a subjective view of the nature of motivation and bring a couple of three simple principles - how to remain a Man, working in a modern company. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  All the same, think. <br>  After a certain period of time, perhaps over the years, usually (but not all) comes the understanding that most of the actions we perform under the influence of nature (genital logic) and desires acquired from society (through marketing) - and only sometimes, during moments of inspiration and recovery, or vice versa, tragedy - we do, it seems to us, free choice. <br>  Some continue to stay awake and want to gain more and more control over themselves and their inner freedom, constantly develop high qualities in themselves, grow professionally - engage in creativity, create something new, and lead along.  Well, the belief is something like this - that you need to do this and only this way all your life. <br>  By developing himself, naturally, a person learns to overcome his own vices and destructive desires.  At the same time, appreciating himself, begins to appreciate the inner man and in others - that is,  despite the strange behavior of others, he sees in them a tremendous objective value, and ... he doesn‚Äôt troll, but at least tries not to harm the personality - and even better, to direct towards development. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/940/6df/61f/9406df61f7c917160d21974e4c8c46a6.jpg"><br>  What should be the company - in which you will work or which you create, so that the above rules of self-development and values ‚Äã‚Äãof people are observed? <br><br>  Let's go over popular desires and inclinations and try to find a fair way out of each. <br><br><h4>  Professionalism </h4><br>  No matter how much we want to look good in the eyes of others, having powdered a malignant tumor of amateurishness (that is, lying because of fear), they teach us in universities and other educational institutions frankly bad (I'm not talking about purchase certificates from the world of the blue pill).  And to become a professional (including IT) - it takes years of sweat and blood.  Therefore, in order to be a Man and develop, you have to learn constantly, both in your free time and at work.  No need to be ashamed of it - this is fair and just.  Therefore, in the Right Company they give the opportunity to learn and share knowledge (internal social networks, courses, time to communicate).  In companies from the world of the blue pill, people simply lie that they are experts, boasting of nonsense in front of each other.  And from the side it looks ... scary.

    <h4>  Want or "can"? </h4><br>  The trouble is when an employee really wants to do one thing, but he‚Äôs good at something completely different.  If you indulge him, then people will be singing without hearing, verses will be read by scribes, and the ruling cruel powerlords will rule.  It takes a lot of patience from you as a manager to create the conditions and reveal to the employee exactly what he does well and convince him to do it, to make him fall in love with the work.  In companies from the world of blue pill ‚Äî they often give people what they want ‚Äî they produce a bunch of directors (which fool will quit his job as the first vice president and mega-leader), and simple and responsible people who simply cannot sit around and talk on social networks . <br><br><h4>  Openness </h4><br>  The task is difficult to solve effectively if there is not enough information.  Managers sometimes use the fact that they know more of the staff and abuse it - the fruit of inefficiency and depravity.  Therefore, strive to create an open, efficient workflow so that everyone can access the necessary information and solve the problem simply and quickly.  In companies from the world of blue pills, employees fear openness, weave secret intrigues, departments duplicate each other's work, and so on.  Try over the head ... <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/317/9f0/37e/3179f037e4e133657a94fea53eb69774.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Bravery </h4><br>  Of course openness requires courage.  Laziness and / or fear of exposing shallow knowledge in any subject area breeds terrible problems that accumulate and then explode with 30 kilotons of feces, infecting dozens of people in the company.  In development, this is generally manifested very clearly.  Therefore, it is good and effective when conditions are created and the search for the causes of problems, the discussion and the search for simple solutions are encouraged.  When it‚Äôs not scary to tell the truth, they will hear you, gather a group and eliminate the ugliness. <br><br><h4>  Strength </h4><br>  Weak is dangerous.  He will substitute and betray at the moment of change of circumstances for the worse - as a result, the task will be solved poorly, superficially, in favor of some fleeting desire.  And then, over time, this time bomb will explode.  One must try to be strong and encourage strength and energy in colleagues and subordinates. <br><br><h4>  Self-esteem </h4><br>  She must be - once.  And to be adequate is two.  Not too high as the stars and not too low, as they sometimes try to make in the companies of the world of the blue pill. <br>  An employee without proper self-esteem is constantly looking for himself - who is coaching his own sadistic inclinations on his subordinates, and who is playing the role of a slave in role-playing games in the office and not only ;-) Both are deviations from Man.  You need to be aware of your level and constantly raise it. <br><br><h4>  Company loyalty </h4><br>  Although, before Freud, it was known that a man never misses an attractive woman and then remembers her (and some more) - in order to be a Man you need to be completely committed to the company in which you work.  It's not about all options and shares - you just need to give yourself to the fullest, without a trace, during working hours.  There is, you see, partial love - either all or nothing :-) The employee, therefore, either himself or with the manager - works to understand the importance of working in the company, every hour spent.  I'm serious.  Otherwise, you are an adulterer.  You are no longer acting like a Man, but as a bastard cat in the spring ‚Äî you hang around in social networks during office hours, etc. <br><br><h4>  Especially smart </h4><br>  There are naturally very clever and talented people.  It is a fact.  One of these two in a team - and you can fly to Mars in a week.  But this is also a curse given for even more intensive work on oneself by the construction of Man :-) In the companies of the world of the blue pill these people are cherished and condoned - but you just need to create conditions for the effective inclusion of this subject in the work, in the team, so that he will forget about himself, indulged in his beloved work with colleagues and stopped crying for life and giving others pain because he could not find a place for himself. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d1e/c59/3a2/d1ec593a240b9ce80109786e3cc1c2bb.jpg"><br>  Did you read to the end?  You are precisely the chosen means.  Observing the above principles and not stopping the reception of the red pill - keeping faith in yourself, as a Man, and in your colleagues, leaders or subordinates, without exchanging instincts for small things - you boldly step through life forward, towards development, towards Man - every day . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/179967/">https://habr.com/ru/post/179967/</a></p>
