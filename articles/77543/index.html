      The question arises, does the ‚Äúcreator‚Äù (developer) take into account the needs of the person playing?  That is, it is clear that by all means it tries to take into account, but it turns out less often than we would like. <br><br>  And here it is important to note the tendency of development of different industries, like the gaming industry, film and music.  In many ways, large corporations are developing in the direction of globalization.  The word ‚Äúglobalization‚Äù here means the unification of products, which allows them to be sold without being limited to the limits of a specific country or region. <br><br>  To solve such a complex task, it is worthwhile to comprehend what is common to every human individual, and, in my opinion, one of the ways to solve this problem lies in taking into account genetic programs or instincts that are not recognized by man. <img src="http://i011.radikal.ru/0711/bf/529bb95dbe65.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  I tried to take these things into account when working on the Stone Age project.  At a certain stage of the development of the ‚ÄúStone Age‚Äù concept, there was a feeling of an involuntary emerging mosaic, which ultimately appeared as a world with many interconnected and complementary details.  And the most interesting thing is that these details as if formed themselves into a complete picture of the world.  At some point, this picture began an independent life. <br><br>  Many writers comment on their creative process in very similar terms.  At some stage, the structure of the work begins to dictate the further development of the storyline. <br><br>  At some point, the thought arose: are there scientific studies that shed light on the deep nature of the mechanisms that make people (and animals) behave this way and not otherwise?  Suspicions were more than justified.  Instincts, as genetically incorporated programs, affect our behavior contrary to our consciousness.  Instincts are not trained, they are laid in the form of genetic information.  Instincts are necessary for the survival of a species. <br><br>  In this article, we will use the research scientists ethologists.  For clarity, we will try to draw the reader‚Äôs attention to the intuitive (perhaps conscious) use of instincts in the Peter Blacks / White game Molyneux. <br><br>  Reference: Ethology - the science of instinctive (innate, based on the genetic program) behavior of animals and humans. <br><br>  Introductory part <br><br>  one statement, I quote: <br>  In Hollywood they learned with high probability to calculate the success of a product, which is proved by the dominance of American cinema in the world. <br><br>  This statement is directly related to the topic of this article. <br><br>  * Man, like all animals, has many innate programs of behavior (we are born with some knowledge of the world and the rules of behavior in it), and at the right moment they work. <br>  * Instinctive programs arose over many millions of years, and helped counter external aggression.  Largely for this reason, human behavior is not always adequate, rational and desirable.  Not all that is natural is good. <br>  * Due to the initial programming, people are not absolutely free in their behavior, one script they carry out easily, the other - with difficulties, and some scenarios may not be feasible at all.  (Not all plans invented by reason are feasible for us.) <br>  * For most situations, a person has a sufficient set of alternative programs on the basis of which several behaviors can be built.  (Everyone initially ‚Äúknows‚Äù how to steal, and they know that this is bad; whether we are thieves or honest depends on us, not on our nature.) <br>  * The structure of the human brain is such that the part responsible for consciousness, not only can not affect the innate programs, but does not even have an idea about their existence.  For this reason, when you turn on the program, the mind begins to obey instinct, not understanding the original source.  Motivation of actions is explained later, and not always true.  From which it follows - one cannot rely on the subjective perception of what is happening, since it gives a confused and unreliable picture. <br><br>  It can also be noted that research in the field of genetic programs (instincts) was used, among other things, by the creators of the neuro-linguistic programming - NLP, which is fashionable in our days.  They are widely used by political consultants during elections. <br><br>  Based on numerous studies, ethologists have found that man interprets instinctive clues incoherently and incorrectly.  And this misunderstanding is explained by the fact that the "rules of subordination" between instinct and reason were developed even when strong instinctive programs were the main pillar of complex and perfect behavior, and weak reason occupied a subordinate position.  But in humans, unlike animals, the relationship between them is the opposite, although the brain parts that determine the innate behavior still give commands to the mind, without giving any explanation. <br><br>  Often a person is not aware of the fact that an instinctive program works in it, affecting his behavior.  In such cases, everyone tries to explain his behavior by manifesting his own will: ‚Äúso I want,‚Äù ‚Äúbut how else‚Äù or traditions - ‚Äúdo everything everyone does‚Äù, or how the execution of your will- ‚Äúso be it‚Äù, ‚ÄúI have to do it‚Äù. <br><br>  Instincts and how they work <br><br>  Zoologists call the four traits by which man is unique among modern mammals: upright walking, speaking, using fire, and the ability to more and more improve their tools.  Humanities add a fifth to this set - religious feeling. <br><br>  Further, it is this feeling that divides people into those for whom it is evidence of the existence of some supernatural power, and those who do not believe in it.  The latter have to somehow explain the phenomenon of religiosity.  And here they come to a standstill.  Trying to bring this feeling out of the savage‚Äôs fear of nature and the mystical primitive consciousness, they do not say anything essential.  Why did primitive man have to fear nature more than his prehuman ancestors, and more than other animals?  We know about the latter that they love nature ‚Äî the world around them.  And the art of an ancient person ‚Äî both Late Paleolithic figures, and drawings in caves located in Spain and France, and thousands of drawings on rocks in the Sahara ‚Äî are all imbued with a love of nature.  Images of any animals - large and small, useful and useless, edible and predators - created not only with accurate knowledge of their appearance and movements, but also with a sense of admiration. <br><br>  In recent decades, a lot of important information for humanities collected ethologists studying congenital (genetically inherited) behavior programs in animals.  It cannot be said that the new science explained all the mysteries of human behavior, for it is still very difficult.  But something of the mystery for the social psychologist, for the ethologist becomes obvious.  In many respects, the materials were chosen deliberately, taking into account the specifics of game development.  We use the game ‚ÄúBlack &amp; White‚Äù as a material for analysis. The reader is invited to pay attention to how genetic programs are used in this game. <br><br>  Ritualized behavior <br><br>  Many animals have ritualized behavior, they like to walk on the same path, repeating the same movements, sticking to the daily routine.  Children are also ritualistic (who did not walk in childhood on planks or slabs of the floor, carefully avoiding stepping on the joints?). <br><br>  K. Lorenz showed that the weak or inexperienced intellect is forbidden to be presumptuous, to search for cause-and-effect relations in everything.  It is better for him not to look for them, but just to memorize events connected with something and try to repeat them again if nothing bad has happened.  If you confuse the cause with the effect, it can turn into a disaster.  According to this kind of logic, prompted by instinct, the fox should again look for a hare under the bush where she caught it yesterday.  Instinctive logic inevitably leads to the development of a lot of signs, taboos, rituals, secret knowledge, superstitions and religions. <br><br>  In Peter Molyneux‚Äôs Black &amp; White, the religious component is in a sense the basis of the game.  The metaphysical world of the game ‚ÄúBlack &amp; White‚Äù is completely built on rituals that determine the behavior of both the player himself, acting on the game universe with the help of an invisible hand, and the population worshiping the player god.  It should be noted that the implementation of magical actions is ritualized, for example, to create food, our incarnation should draw an S-shape with your hand, and after a moment we get a cornucopia from which you can feed the starving population who asked the player god for indulgence.  Rituals determine not only the interaction with the environment of the player - God, but also the characters.  The villagers, believing in the omnipotence of the player - God, lain him with mana, which allows him to expand his sphere of influence.  Thus, there is mutually beneficial cooperation. <br><br>  An example of magical thinking on modern material is the movie ‚ÄúAmelie‚Äù: a scene where the main character as a child became involved in photography.  There is a collision of two cars, which coincides with the click of the camera.  The neighbor decides to play a trick on little Amelie, and claims that the cause of the incident is none other than herself.  Subsequently, Amelie, sitting at the TV screen, with horror feels that all the disasters occur through her fault. <br><br>  Different types of aggression <br><br>  In ethology, the definition of the term ‚Äúaggressiveness‚Äù differs from the generally accepted one.  In everyday life, aggression is associated with an unjustified and unjust attack.  In ethology, the term "aggressiveness" means anger, anger, hatred, rage.  It is not emotionally colored - neither negatively nor positively.  This concept is neutral. <br><br>  For developers, understanding the truth of the essence of aggression is very important.  In the concept of many games laid aggression.  Often, developers are trying to make a definite message to the player, who in turn can interpret it completely differently.  This means that the meaning may not be conveyed.  And if this moment of the game was the key, then perhaps the whole essence of the game will elude the understanding of the player. <br><br>  Interspecies aggression <br><br>  In nature, some species inevitably attack others.  But not every attack in ethology is called aggression.  When a wolf catches a hare, it is not aggression, but hunting.  Similarly, when a hunter shoots a duck or a fisherman catches fish, this is not aggressive behavior.  After all, they all do not feel any hostility towards the victim, neither fear, nor anger, nor hatred.  Aggression is an attack of a dog that guards its territory, or the reaction of a person throwing stones at a dog.  Even annoying mosquito can cause aggression. <br><br>  Interspecific aggression, even when manifested by weak animals with respect to the stronger one, is an important instinctive program.  It allows the seagull to drive away or divert the person from the nest, despite the fear. <br><br>  Peter Molyneux's ‚ÄúBlack &amp; White‚Äù is a huge self-sufficient world, an ecosystem with its own laws, in which different species develop.  A being who is our Companion, and in a sense a prophet, turns into "our faith."  A creature often shows interspecific aggression, both in respect of villagers, and in respect of other Beings, fighting in battles.  In the game you can also watch the hunting of wolves for sheep, fishing ... <br><br>  Interspecific aggression is a wonderful way to build the staging in a game, territorial claims in the game space naturally fit into the concept of games.  And it is not at all necessary that the game was about animals, it is important that everyone understands intuitively why the robot may not like the society of the aggressor. <br><br>  Intraspecific aggression <br><br>  In the life of most species of animals, intraspecific aggression occupies an important place.  Individuals of the same species come into conflict, protecting food, choosing a home, of course, because of a female, etc.  etc. <br><br>  The appearance or approach of another individual with obscure intentions inevitably causes wariness (a slight form of fear).  If the intentions are not clarified, often nothing else remains, either to escape or to attack first.  When entering into conflict, both animals experience fear.  And then there is aggression. <br><br>  Intraspecific aggression in the ‚ÄúBlack &amp; White‚Äù game is manifested in the form of opposition from players embodying different gods and trying to expand their zone of influence.  After all, the struggle takes place with an equal in strength, but hostile god for the expansion of the zone of influence, in the context of the struggle for the souls of the villagers. <br><br>  Often this context is the meaning of the games.  Is not this instinct forcing people to arm themselves now for protection from unwanted guests? <br><br>  The relationship of aggression and fear <br><br>  Dealing with a safe animal is not difficult.  But to confront a really dangerous creature, regardless of size, can be very scary.  So, shaking off a scorpion from clothing is accompanied by aggression with an admixture of a fair amount of fear. <br><br>  Ethologists claim that aggression and fear are interrelated.  Aggression is accompanied by fear, and fear can escalate into aggression. <br><br>  If a group of animals catch fear, they become more aggressive.  The same happens with a crowd of people or society as a whole.  The aggressively cowardly state is the most dangerous. <br><br>  In the Black &amp; White game, the relationship between aggression and fear is one of the main factors in expanding the zone of influence.  A player-god can use force to conquer a village, bringing down his anger in the form of fireballs or sizzling lightning (a repertoire common to God).  The villagers gradually, out of fear, cease to believe in the warring player of the god, and as soon as the level of faith fades away, the fear grows into the love of a new strong god. <br><br>  A small note: genetic programs usually work together;  in our example, other genetic programs that are related to the hierarchy in the herd are starting to work.  See bibliography. <br><br>  Aggressiveness can accumulate <br><br>  In the recent past, psychologists have argued that fear arises solely under the influence of external stimuli.  But ethologists have shown that aggression is a constant factor that gradually accumulates, even in the absence of a stimulus, and the threshold for launching aggression gradually decreases.  For this reason, even a minor excuse can lead to quite serious affects. <br><br>  This was observed in many interesting experiments.  One of them, available to every aquarist, was described by Lorenz.  Take a pair of family fish - cichlids and place to them in the aquarium some source of conflict - the third cichlid or another snooty fish.  A couple of cichlids will fight with them, and among themselves maintain the kindest relationship.  Now remove the object of aggression - and after a while the male will begin to attack the female.  Now divide the aquarium with glass in half and place another pair of cichlids in the other half.  Couples will fight with each other through glass, and as a result, peace will reign within each pair.  Make the glass translucent and conflicts will arise in both pairs. <br><br>  The same accumulated aggression explodes small, closed groups of people from within.  Several friendly, self-respecting people who know that it is impossible to conflict in such conditions leave for wintering or on an expedition.  Time passes, and if there is no external object for the manifestation of aggressiveness, people in the group begin to hate each other, and long-restrained aggression eventually finds the most trivial cause for a big scandal.  There are many cases when close friends who got into such an "experiment" reached the point of murder. <br><br>  In ordinary life, our aggressiveness is daily discharged through a lot of minor conflicts with many people.  We can learn to somehow manage our aggressiveness, but we cannot completely eliminate it, because it is one of the strongest human instincts.  And it is important to remember that protecting the aggressive person from irritants, we do not reduce its aggressiveness, but only accumulate.  She still breaks, and immediately a large portion.  Disappointing, but true. <br><br>  Many opponents of computer games are trying to ban so-called violent games in some countries.  It seems to me that ethology will allow every developer to reasonably respond to such attacks.  Games are a factor that significantly discharges accumulated aggression in society, and raises the launch threshold. <br><br>  Aggression is redirected <br><br>  Aggression is redirected if the stimulus is quite real, but frightening.  In this case, the redirected aggression serves at the same time as a demonstration to the enemy: ‚ÄúLook what I can do with you.‚Äù  Very often, aggression is redirected to living objects, both of an alien species and of its own, if only they could not give the change.  The angry owner can kick his dog.  A husband who got a scolding at work - curse his wife when he came home;   ‚Äî  ;  ‚Äî  .              . <br><br>  ¬´Black&amp;White¬ª       .      ,   .   ,      ,  ,         . <br><br> ,       ¬´ ,   ¬ª. <br><br>   <br><br>    <br><br> ,    ,   ,    ,     .     .    ,        ,   .      ‚Äî  .    ,      ‚Äî      .     .  ,    ,   - -          ,  ,        . <br><br>   ,       ,  ,         .    ,   ,     ‚Äî   . <br><br>    ‚Äî    .         ‚Äî     .        .            ,         .    ,     . ,   ,    ‚Ä¶ <br><br>     <br><br>     ,   ,  . ,   ,    ,         (¬´ ¬ª),    .  ,      .
