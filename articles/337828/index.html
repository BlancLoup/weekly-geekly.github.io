The need to create it arises during the implementation phase of ITSM. <br><br>  This is clear from the analogies that Sharon Taylor, chief architect of the third edition of ITIL, <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/it-service-catalog-in-5-steps/">makes</a> .  It compares the service catalog with iTunes or the App Store for businesses, an online directory and a resource for developers at the same time.  We will deal with this topic with the help of a small checklist. <br><br> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/it-guild/blog/337828/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/cb/58/59cb58214f09d095079011.jpeg"></a> <a name="habracut"></a><br>  <font color="#A9A9A9"><i>/ Flickr / <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/kulturarvsprojektet/6498619601/">DRs Kulturarvsprojekt</a> / <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/">CC</a></i></font>

      When an enterprise begins to work with a catalog of services, the question arises about how to compile it.  To deal with this, consider the necessary steps and conditions. <br><br><h2>  Step 1. Team building </h2><br>  Of course, competent people who are familiar with the subject matter should take part in compiling the catalog of services.  It is important to connect to the work of IT-department. <br><br>  The number of people who will participate in the creation of the catalog depends on the size of the organization and the volume of services provided.  Of course, there must be a person or a responsible team appointed to take over the role of the catalog manager. <br><br>  It will also be good if the team includes a management representative and at least several end users.  Often, they perceive tasks differently than employees of the IT department, and operate with other service names.  This approach will help find a balance and make the catalog of services understandable. <br><br><h2>  Step 2. Collect Feedback </h2><br>  In addition to communicating with end users, it is important to extend the work with feedback to specific business users.  It is necessary to find out the requests of team leaders and managers.  This will also help clarify the cost of each service. <br><br><h2>  Step 3. Creating a list of services </h2><br>  Taylor notes that the easiest and at the same time effective way to start creating a service catalog is to collect a list of services already provided.  The inventory should be comprehensive.  According to Troy DuMoulin, vice president of the Pink Elephant, ITSM consulting group, this is the key to creating an effective directory.  Each service must be listed separately, and after - within the category.  The next step requires a list of services that the IT department does not provide at the moment, but is going to provide it in the future. <br><br>  Now is the time to use the results of collecting feedback and find the intersection between capabilities and queries.  Taylor advises not to overload the first version of the catalog and adhere to several key processes.  Of course, based on specific business requests.  ITIL expert Michael Scarborough <a href="https://www.globalknowledge.nl/content/files/documents/White-Papers/ITIL-White-Paper-Building-Effective-Service-Catalogs">recalls</a> : ‚ÄúHaving a large number of services in the directory does not necessarily make it better or more suitable for business.  Having the right combination of services in an easily accessible catalog is what the business wants. ‚Äù <br><br>  After drawing up the final version of the list of services, intuitive descriptions should be prepared for each of them. <br><br><h2>  Step 4. Allocation of resources and responsibility. </h2><br>  The main task now is to establish dependencies between the service being performed and the resources required for its execution, including the definition of executors, accounting for the contribution of third-party suppliers, IT components and processes. <br><br>  Based on this, it is worthwhile to determine the parameters of use: the level of access for performers, the ability to make changes, and so on.  Each category of services should have an owner, as well as the first, second and third levels of support with a clear delineation of responsibility and authority. <br><br><h2>  Step 5. Preparing the catalog in two versions </h2><br>  When the list of services as a structure is ready, it is time to organize a catalog.  After forming the basis for the technical version of the catalog, it makes sense to adapt it to the second important category - the client. <br><br>  It contains only top-level information in a concise form and without technical details.  It is important to answer questions such as ‚ÄúDoes the business user use the word infrastructure for backup services?‚Äù And, accordingly, get rid of the confusion in the simplified version. <br><br>  Regarding the basic version, how to specifically organize and classify services depends on the size of the organization, the needs of the end user, and - most important - the logic.  This is the basis of user experience. <br><br><h2>  Step 6. Control tests </h2><br>  Now it's time to go through the finished directory.  To ensure its availability, you should use at least one end user.  Do not involve too many people in this process, otherwise you will not avoid the famous culinary problem ‚Äúthe more cooks, the worse the broth‚Äù. <br><br>  At this stage it is important to identify several key indicators to measure.  For example, changing the time for processing emergency requests with or without a directory. <br><br><h2>  Step 7. Publishing the service catalog </h2><br>  To open the general access to the catalog in many cases is better in stages.  So you can check the performance of a small set of services and identify duplicate errors.  Publication of the service catalog must be announced in advance. <br><br>  It would not be superfluous to think up incentive programs for end users.  For example, you can develop a training manual for working with him and encourage participants to undergo training.  It is important to explain exactly how the service catalog will be useful to them. <br><br><h2>  Step 8. Automation </h2><br>  There are products for the automation of the catalog.  However, Sharon Taylor insists that these tools should not be immediately resorted to.  Only having felt confidence in the architecture of the service catalog and its supporting processes, enterprises should choose the appropriate software product. <br><br><h2>  Step 9. Directory support </h2><br>  The development of a process for checking and updating the service catalog is included in the list of basic steps, since without relevance the catalog loses its meaning.  It is important to add and remove services and support levels in a timely manner.  That is why a manager or a team should be appointed in advance who will constantly monitor services in accordance with the prepared schedule.  Regular updating and viewing of the catalog of IT services should be carried out at least once a quarter, and a comprehensive audit of the structure should be held once a year.  In addition, it is important to continue to carry out an assessment of key indicators.  This will always maintain an understanding of the efficiency of the directory. <br><br>  PS In our blog you will find other useful service management articles: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://it-guild.com/info/blog/kak-sdelat-itil-bolee-klientoorientirovannoy/">How to make ITIL more customer-oriented</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://it-guild.com/info/blog/4-mifa-ob-upravlenii-uslugami-v-kotorye-vy-ne-dolzhny-verit/">4 myths about managing services that you shouldn‚Äôt believe</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://it-guild.com/info/blog/kak-modernizirovat-upravlenie-it-uslugami/">How to upgrade IT service management</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/337828/">https://habr.com/ru/post/337828/</a></p>
