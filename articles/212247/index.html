Some of them are widely known (who, for example, does not know about hypertreaming?), The majority of non-specialists do not even know about the existence of others.  Let's open a well-known knowledge base for Intel <a href="http://ark.intel.com/">Automated Relational Knowledge Base (ARK)</a> products and select a processor there.  We will see a hefty list of functions and technologies - what lies behind their mysterious marketing names?  We propose to delve into the issue, paying particular attention to the little-known technologies - for sure, there will be many interesting things there. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Intel Demand Based Switching </h4>  Together with Enhanced Intel SpeedStep Technology, Intel Demand Based Switching technology is responsible for ensuring that the processor runs at the optimal frequency and receives adequate electrical power at any given time: no more and no less than is required.  In this way, power consumption and heat dissipation is reduced, which is important not only for portable devices, but also for servers too - this is where Demand Based Switching is used. <br><br><h4>  Intel Fast Memory Access </h4>  The function of the memory controller to optimize work with RAM.  It is a combination of technologies that allows, through in-depth analysis of the command queue, to identify ‚Äúcombined‚Äù commands (for example, reading from the same memory page) and then reorder the actual execution so that the ‚Äúcombined‚Äù commands are executed one after another.  In addition, lower priority commands for writing to memory are planned for those moments when the emptying of the queue for reading is predicted, and as a result, the process of writing to memory even less restricts the speed of reading. <br><br><h4>  Intel Flex Memory Access </h4>  Another function of the memory controller, which appeared at the time when it was a separate chip, back in 2004.  Provides the ability to work in synchronous mode with two memory modules simultaneously, and in contrast to the simple dual-channel mode, which existed before, memory modules can be of different sizes.  In this way, flexibility was achieved in equipping the computer with memory, which is reflected in the title.

    <h4>  Intel Instruction Replay </h4>  A very deep-seated technology, first introduced in Intel Itanium processors.  In the process of the processor pipelines, a situation may occur when the instructions have already come to execute, and the necessary data is not yet available.  The instruction then needs to be ‚Äúreplayed‚Äù: remove it from the conveyor and start it at the beginning.  What actually happens.  Another important feature of IRT is the correction of random errors on processor pipelines.  Read more about this very interesting feature <a href="http://www.intel.ru/content/www/ru/ru/processors/itanium/itanium-9500-reliability-mission-critical-applications-paper.html">here</a> . <br><br><h4>  Intel My WiFi Technology </h4>  Virtualization technology that allows you to add a virtual WiFi adapter to an existing physical one;  Thus, your ultrabook or laptop can be a full access point or repeater.  My WiFi software components are included in the Intel PROSet Wireless Software driver version 13.2 and higher;  It must be borne in mind that only some WiFi adapters are compatible with the technology.  Installation instructions, as well as a list of software and hardware compatibility can be found on <a href="http://support.intel.co.jp/support/wireless/wlan/mywf/sb/cs-030009.htm">the Intel website</a> . <br><br><h4>  Intel Smart Idle Technology </h4>  Another energy saving technology.  Allows you to disable currently unused processor blocks or reduce their frequency.  An indispensable thing for the CPU of a smartphone, it was there that appeared - in the Intel Atom processors. <br><br><h4>  Intel Stable Image Platform </h4>  A term related to business processes rather than technology.  The Intel SIPP program provides software stability by ensuring that the underlying platform components and drivers do not change for at least 15 months.  Thus, corporate clients are able to use the same deployable system images during this period. <br><br><h4>  Intel QuickAssist </h4>  A set of hardware-implemented functions that require large amounts of computing, for example, encryption, compression, pattern recognition.  The point of QuickAssist is to simplify the task of developers by providing them with functional "bricks", as well as speeding up their applications.  On the other hand, the technology makes it possible to entrust ‚Äúheavy‚Äù tasks to not the most powerful processors, which is especially valued in embedded systems, which are very limited both in performance and in power consumption. <br><br><h4>  Intel Quick Resume </h4>  A technology developed for computers based on the Intel Viiv platform that allowed them to turn on and off almost instantly, like TV receivers or DVD players;  while in the "off" state, the computer could continue to perform certain tasks that do not require user intervention.  And although the platform itself has smoothly moved to other incarnations along with the developments that have accompanied it, the line is still present in the ARK, because it was not so long ago. <br><br><h4>  Intel Secure Key </h4>  A generic name for 32-bit and 64-bit RDRAND instructions using the Digital Random Number Generator (DRNG) hardware implementation of the random number generator.  The instruction is used for cryptographic purposes to generate beautiful and high-quality random keys. <br><br><h4>  Intel TSX-NI </h4>  The technology with the complex name Intel Transactional Synchronization Extensions - New Instructions implies a superstructure above the processor cache system that optimizes the execution environment of multi-threaded applications, but, of course, only if these applications use TSX-NI software interfaces.  On the part of the user, this technology is not directly visible, but everyone can read its description in accessible language <a href="http://levin-matveev.livejournal.com/84514.html">on Stepan Koltsov‚Äôs blog</a> . <br><br>  In conclusion, we would like to remind once again that Intel ARK exists not only in the form of a site, but also as an offline application for <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/intel-ark/id587995732%3Fmt%3D8%26ign-mpt%3Duo%253D2">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.intel.ark">Android</a> .
