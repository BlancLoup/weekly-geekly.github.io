I praised the invigorating drink, loved the routine associated with it, but ignored the obvious fact that daily coffee consumption strongly interferes with my energy level, which affects my work, physical performance and general well-being.  I postponed this experiment for more than a year, and decided a few weeks ago and did not regret it. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  The purpose of the experiment </h2><br>  How caffeine works: caffeine blocks adenosine receptors in the brain, preventing the substance from contacting it.  That is, caffeine does not allow the brain to understand that it is tired.

      In the book ‚Äú <a href="https%253A%252F%252Fwww.litres.ru%252Fbred-stoun%252Fthe-everything-store-dzheff-bezos-i-era-amazon%252F">The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the era of Amazon</a> ‚Äù, the author wrote that back in the days when the company was developing in the garage, one of the managers forbade employees to drink coffee.  He believed that the energy for work should be taken from carbohydrates, not caffeine.  And he was right. <br><br>  Regular consumption of coffee reduces its impact and forces us to increase the dose.  As a result, we get a bad quality of sleep, after which, when we wake up, we immediately pour an invigorating drink and drive ourselves into a vicious circle. <br><br>  In addition, caffeine hides the optimal amount of nutrients needed for productive life.  For me it is important, because I train with iron 5 days a week and lack of energy greatly affects my well-being.  Caffeine does not allow the brain to understand that it is tired and therefore I cannot determine that it is hungry.  As a result, by the end of the day, when the caffeine stops, I feel a drop in energy and the only thing I want is to sleep. <br><br><h2>  Coffee as a habit </h2><br>  During the experiment, I had to exclude a pleasant routine of drinking coffee in a shopping center, in the office, on the street and, in general, everywhere.  Turning coffee into a habit, we act unreasonably, as caffeine is a powerful source of energy that must be used strategically. <br><br>  At the moment I do not drink coffee for several weeks, but if I need to do a lot of work, I use this resource.  Now my energy level is in good condition and I do not find the need for coffee.  I sleep 6-7 hours. <br><br><h2>  Coffee affected sleep </h2><br>  The lack of coffee had a positive effect on the quality of sleep.  I always fell asleep quickly, but now it‚Äôs easier for me to wake up.  If earlier this motivation helped me to do something meaningful, then the last weeks I periodically wake up a few minutes before the alarm clock with a good mood. <br><br><h2>  Energy level changed </h2><br>  By excluding coffee at the time, I was able to measure my true energy level.  Previously, it was difficult to do, as caffeine artificially increased it, followed by a decline.  Now I can determine how much I need to sleep / eat in order to feel good and work productively. <br><br><h2>  I understood how much to eat </h2><br>  For many months, I felt a lack of energy.  I tried to cope with this with the help of coffee, but only by refusing from it I realized that I was just eating an insufficient amount of carbohydrates (cereals, fruits).  With intense training, the body needs many times more energy.  Refusing coffee helped me determine how much.  Now if I feel a drop in energy, I just make a bite, and not pour another cup of coffee. <br><br><h2>  findings </h2><br><ul><li>  Do not make coffee a habit.  Coffee is a powerful resource and needs to be used strategically.  Use it before a strong mental or physical exertion several times a week / month. </li><li>  Refusal of coffee improves the quality of sleep.  This affects the recovery and productivity in the work. </li><li>  By eliminating coffee, I determined the required amount of nutrients.  Focusing on well-being, I added carbohydrates, fats and, thus, determined the amount that helps me train and work effectively. </li><li>  If you feel sleepy, then most likely you do not sleep or eat a little.  Or forget to take breaks while working.  I felt the importance of the last point in full this week. </li></ul><br><br><h2>  Conclusion </h2><br>  No need to give up coffee if you feel full of energy.  In my case, this experiment was necessary.  On the other hand, such calls help to learn something new about the organism and life. <br><br>  This is not my first experiment.  In the summer of 2016, I woke up at 5:30, spent two workouts a day, worked 10 hours a day and learned a lot about my body.  In addition, I seriously advanced in professional terms. <br><br>  Such experiments are very useful.  They pull us out of a comfortable life.  It's like a cold shower in the morning, which I recently loved.  We are sometimes so addicted to our habits that we are afraid to step further.  Even if we are waiting for something incredible. <br><br>  <i>Author: <a href="http://www.ilyasidorenko.ru/">Ilya Sidorenko</a></i> <br>  Read more of our articles on our blog: <a href="http://smarttalks.club/">SmartTalks</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/323710/">https://habr.com/ru/post/323710/</a></p>
