  <section class="page js-page"><h1>We invite you to test drive a powerful business car "Simple Business"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  We drove our horse from the repair - a beautiful and powerful CRM machine ‚ÄúSimple Business‚Äù.  For the winter, we pounded her on THAT, completely replaced the engine and did a little tuning.  We also made a motorcycle from the ‚ÄúSimple Business‚Äù motor scooter for iOS.  So, the new version of ‚ÄúSimple Business‚Äù for Windows 1.9.0.0 ‚ÄúDearborn‚Äù and the new version of the ‚ÄúSimple Business‚Äù application for iOS are ready for a test drive. <br>  <b>Transition to a new database management system (new engine)</b> <a name="habracut"></a><br>  The most important thing that we have done in the process of servicing our <a href="http://www.prostoy.ru/">simple business organization management system</a> is replacing the engine.  The engine, in our case, is the database management system.  We switched to a more powerful and faster Firebird system.  Significantly increased the speed of all objects in the program - loading the comments feed in tasks, loading volumetric tables (for example, client databases), searching, and so on.  Of course, for new users, almost nothing has changed - with a small amount of data, the old system also worked quickly.  But our regular customers who have been working in the program for a long time, large companies that have a large amount of information and, in fact, we are very happy about this "new thing."  Figuratively speaking, if earlier the company responded to customer requests as an ordinary car drives along a city road, now it‚Äôs like a racing car on a high-speed highway. <br>  <b>Comments, reminders and history of changes in the customer base</b> <br>  In the CRM module, in which the client base is maintained, there are three distinct functions.  This is to the <b>comments in the client's card, plus the same place - correspondence by e-mail and reminders.</b>  Previously, the correspondence was also stored in one place - in the task, but for each client it was necessary to create a separate task and then work in it, open it if you need to see something, now the comments on the client and the correspondence are stored directly in the client card, no tasks need to be created.  Reminders on the comments in the client card - this is an update of the brake system, the most important thing.  Now you will not forget exactly who to call and when - a reminder will pop up at the right moment.  The third updated feature is the <b>history of changes in the client database.</b>  Now you can see when, who and how changed any record for any client. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6ca/164/e34/6ca164e347b4d91ce4c855ed29753d06.png" alt="image"><br>  <b>Formatting phone numbers, new quick start wizard, new windows icons</b> <br>  Some more "chips" of the new version (tuning).  The possibilities of touch control of the system have expanded (relevant for new notebook models with touch screens).  The formatting of telephone numbers was added, for example, in the employee's questionnaire (now the code is separated by brackets, and the number itself is separated by hyphens to facilitate perception), and now the client database does not need to write the number strictly in international format to call it ‚Äî the phone number is now You can write in any form (with spaces, brackets, etc.).  Made redesign and simplification of the quick start wizard.  In telephony, we turned off the music for calls to external numbers, so that managers could hear why they didn‚Äôt get through to the customer - busy or the number is unavailable, and so on.  Almost all icons in the windows of the program were replaced with more modern and beautiful ones. <br>  Well, the business car is ready for a test drive, we invite you to <a href="http://www.prostoy.ru/register">take a ride</a> ! <br>  <b>New version of iOS application</b> <br>  Together with the new Windows version, the updated <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/prostoj-biznes/id735181505%3Fmt%3D8">Simple Business application for iOS devices has been released</a> .  And if earlier it was rather an additional version of the main Windows and web, now we can say that the application for iOS has become an independent and full version of the program.  Now you can work only with the application - the creation of the organization, its editing, inviting employees to the organization appeared;  change of access rights to projects;  creation of cases, their execution, transfer, change of importance, commenting, reminders of cases in the news feed and building a route to the place of the case in the application-cards of your device;  appeared creating and editing contacts;  there was a discovery of files attached to comments in third-party applications for working with them.  This is despite the fact that all the other most important functions in the application have long been there.  You can try a new application either in the AppStore under the name ‚ÄúSimple business‚Äù, or by <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/prostoj-biznes/id735181505%3Fmt%3D8">reference</a> . <br>  <i>We wish you a pleasant test drive of new products!</i> </div>
