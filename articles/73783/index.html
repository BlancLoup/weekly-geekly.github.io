  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why I don't like Web 2.0</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="http://www.railsonwave.com/assets/2006/12/28/Web_2.0_Map.png" alt="image"><br>  For the first time decided to write something not about F #, and maybe nothing.  :) <br>  Probably, after reading the following, some will say that this is just a formless stream of thoughts, others will consider me a retrograde, and others - Don Quixote, struggling with windmills.  Maybe.  But sometimes why not fight. <br>  Yes, I do not like Web 2.0, not even the whole Web 2.0, but its specific part, but the part, I would say, is rather formative.  After all, how often determine the current state of the Internet?  As an era, user-generated content.  And what is the main apologist for this concept, if not the blogosphere?  So, I do not like blogs.  And not the blogs themselves, but mainly the way they are used. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Agree, in the definition of user-generated content there is a certain amount of cunning - well, and before that this same content that robots generated?  Another thing is that the content generator and the creator of the site used to be the same person, but now they are different.  So, earlier, in order to place your content on the Internet, you had to dig into html, make a website for yourself, and only then ... But people wanted easier.  To no problem.  To sit down, write and everything is ready.  And this was more desirable for people who have nothing to write by and large, except perhaps for their personal experiences. <br>  I think I‚Äôm not mistaken if I say that it was for these people that it was invented, and they also supported the concept of blogs - online diaries, where it‚Äôs so convenient to post your daily thoughts, which in most cases except the author himself are only interesting for close friends and your own cat ( especially if her photos are posted there).  But there were (and still are) such people a lot.  And blog platforms all develop, spread and multiply, to such an extent that we now practically do not imagine a different way of self-expression in the network. <br>  So what's the trouble, well, you do not like "cozy diaries", well, do not pay attention.  But the problem lies not in these diaries.  She is a little deeper.  The problem appeared when people, who really have something to say, professionals, after ordinary users began to make their personal websites in the form of blogs.  And this is really a problem. <br><br>  Tell me, what is the meaning of the placement of the article in the array of articles by a major financial analyst about various models for analyzing stock markets (conditionally)?  That's right, no.  But the trouble is, the blog does not think so.  It seems to him that the newest article, it is the best, and deserves a better place on the author‚Äôs website, at the top of the main page.  It does not matter what this article says about the release of version 1.4.67.865 of some domain-specific framework, but an article about key concepts describing this very area, written first in some old 2000, has long been hidden under the veil of history. <br><br>  Webodin.nol sites had a terrible design, disgusting fonts and inconceivable layout, but they had one important advantage, they allowed the author to structure the information contained on the site at will. <br>  Today, if I accidentally hit a blog, I sometimes want to get to know it better, but I just don‚Äôt know where to start, or where to finish.  Read it from the beginning, from the end, or maybe from the middle?  Sometimes it comes to the absurd: going into the post, ‚Äútram-pam-pam.  Part 7 "I have a natural desire to first get acquainted with the 6th previous ones.  And then I have to parse a half-site in search of the right articles.  But they are also located backwards, well, full of beauty.  Thanks to some authors, they initially post links to previous posts, they see that their blog platform is doing something wrong. <br>  And all pribludy for Wordpress, like a list of the most popular posts, or a list of related posts, they are trying to solve this very problem, but without success, because no computer brain can better understand the author what to do with his pile of materials.

      By the way, all this blogging is generally close to killing the concept of personal websites as some unique objects with their own identity.  Going to a new blog site that we liked, what are we doing?  - subscribe to it, and in most cases we don‚Äôt see it anymore.  For us, it turns into one direct stream of information like a gut, and that information which is already somewhere far away in this gut will most likely remain unreviewed by us, simply because the author has not explained to us where to look. <br><br>  I don‚Äôt know exactly what the ideal personal site of a professional expert should look like, but certainly, the constantly changing look of the main page, depending on the momentary mood of its owner and reflecting only his current thoughts, is not the best option.  I‚Äôm not saying that site news in the order of their dating should not be at all, but in my opinion they should not be the only possible way to communicate with this site. <br>  And you know, I can still understand when a specialist in the field of cross-stitching organizes his content in such an inefficient way, but when a guru who writes high-level posts about the same ASP.NET does the same thing, it seems sad to me irony. <br>  PS I haven‚Äôt yet seen a perfect website from my point of view, but if you take the one who is most eager for this, then this is probably the website of Martin Fowler.  <a href="http://martinfowler.com/">martinfowler.com</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/73783/">https://habr.com/ru/post/73783/</a></p>
