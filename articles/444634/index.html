Developers, digital artists, students, teachers, schools, etc. can apply for gratuitous funding under the <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/megagrants">Epic MegaGrants</a> program. Formally, it is not even necessary to use the Unreal Engine 4 toolkit; it is enough to participate in open source 3D projects. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Epic MegaGrants - an evolutionary development of the previous Unreal Dev Grants program.  This fund of $ 5 million was founded in 2015, and the last grants were distributed just this week. <br><br>  Epic MegaGrants provides grants ranging from $ 5,000 to $ 30,000. Although participants in any open source 3D projects can apply for them, preference is given to ‚ÄúUE4 development teams of any size‚Äù who are already using this engine or trying to transfer an existing project to it.  According to the documentation, film and television teams who want to use UE4 can also count on the grant;  corporate development teams using UE4 in non-player areas such as architecture, product design and automotive, students and teachers using UE4 for educational and research purposes;  and open source developers creating tools that can be useful to the wider UE community.
