Stratasys / Makerbot: in a prominent place - you will not miss (USA)</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d61/620/4d8/d616204d842a48b182f43f02cc3760d3.jpg"><br><br>  This is the first stand that gets in the way of every visitor to the exhibition.  The <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/manufacturer-stratasys.html">Stratasys</a> company has invested a lot of money in order to take the most attractive place from the visual point of view at the exhibition.  Although it is worthwhile to pay tribute to the guys: they are trying to - they are promoting two brands right now that were clearly presented on separate displays (unlike, for example, the exhibition in Frankfurt, where the main emphasis was placed on the <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/manufacturer-stratasys.html">Strasys</a> brand). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9a6/384/0f8/9a63840f8ad545c48fe8e5e982284320.jpg"><br><br>  <b>2. Mutoh Engineering: Local Giant (Japan)</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4e9/f36/b8d/4e9f36b8dc724e998d2075ca1d828af3.jpg"><br><br>  Mutoh Industries is an ordinary Japanese conglomerate, a large industrial group with the widest range of activities, including <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/3d-pechat-ob-ektov.html">3D printing</a> technology, which is the responsibility of the Mutoh Engineering division.  At the exhibition, they presented a new line of personal <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/kupit-3d-printer/">3D printers</a> , presented by <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/wiki/fdm/">FDM</a> and <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/wiki/sla/">SLA</a> devices. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/14b/ef0/cd4/14bef0cd4027455aa2fdd4b49542a23d.jpg"><br><br>  However, it should be noted that the 3D-printers from Mutoh Engineering have a relatively low cost.  We have not found any feedback on these devices, but there is information that it is almost impossible to purchase them outside of Japan. <br><br>  In short, a typical Japanese approach with a focus on the domestic market.  I don‚Äôt know how correct it would be to say so, but there is a feeling that Mutoh is too large and powerful conglomerate, which is forgiven much, and he uses it: he has taken his small niche in the 3D industry, but he draws his main income from very different areas of industry. <br><br>  It should also be noted that at the exhibition Mutoh Engineering shared the space with <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/manufacturer-3d-systems">3D Systems</a> , which presented to the public a 3D printer called <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/kupit-3d-printer/projet-460-plus.html">ProJet 460plus</a> , while Mutoh presented the Value Arc MA 5000-S1, (which looks more like a bulky metal cabinet, than the printer) and the <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/kupit-3d-skaner/scanning_people/">3D scanner of the human body</a> .  The second one, however, had not quite the presentation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/793/0ca/8f3/7930ca8f346a4a818b64b4f7e80ef593.jpg"><br><br>  New <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/kupit-3d-printer/projet-460-plus.html">ProJet 460Plus</a> 3D <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/kupit-3d-printer/projet-460-plus.html">Printer</a> from 3D Systems <br><br>  <b>3. XYZPrinting: made in Taiwan and ready to conquer the whole world</b> <br><br>  Without a doubt, the most "friendly-tuned" stand at the exhibition. <br><br>  Taiwanese manufacturer <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/manufacturer-xyzprinting.html">XYZPrinting</a> made a good impression at CES, which was held in Las Vegas a few weeks earlier.  In Tokyo, they only confirmed their ambitions to become the undisputed leader in the consumer segment of the market. <br><br>  Visitors to the booth were met by super-helpful company assistants who, among other things, knew English quite well (a great rarity, believe me - most of the booths were not very friendly and, in addition, could not say a word in English ...). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c7a/b00/c1f/c7ab00c1fada40ccb6deb2b2765df9ce.jpg"><br><br>  Devices with such curious names as <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/xyzprinting-da-vinci-1-aio.html">Da Vinci AIO</a> , <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/xyzprinting-da-vinci-junior.html">Da Vinci Junior</a> , plus, a new SLA-device: everything is as one on the displays, in all details - as a result, a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãattention and interest from the public.  I appreciated the <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/kupit-3d-skaner">3D-scanner</a> in action, which, although it did not seem to me to be particularly convenient to use, but produced brilliant results.  In its price category, this portable <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/kupit-3d-skaner">3D-scanner</a> that uses sensors from Intel has no equal to itself yet. <br><br>  <b>4. Polymaker: Innovation Pushing Forward (China)</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4d3/449/bff/4d3449bff1514871955bdb3b0b27766f.jpg"><br><br>  The guys from Polymaker have developed a special biopolymer fiber with properties close to <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/materiali/abs-plastik">ABS</a> and <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/materiali/pla-plastik">PLA</a> polymers.  In addition, their filaments are odorless, biodegradable and can be used at very low temperatures. <br><br>  <b>5. BuildTak (USA)</b> <br><br>  And in the immediate vicinity of the Polymaker stand, another interesting company called BuildTak is located - a company aimed at solving the most pressing problem that every user of 3D devices faces sooner or later.  The BuildTak team has created an ‚Äúideal 3D printing surface‚Äù ‚Äîthe product, which is a plastic shield that fits on the <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/wiki/fdm/">FDM</a> stand of the 3D printer and ensures maximum stability of the printed object.  As they say: all ingenious is simple.  So here is an excellent solution to the actual problem.  It seems that American companies nevertheless have gathered their will into a fist and are looking to the future with confidence.  Their presence at the exhibition in Tokyo only confirms this thesis. <br><br>  <b>6. bonsai lab (Japan)</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/423/975/b39/423975b39874414ebf20555710e4fe5d.jpg"><br><br>  The bonsai lab company introduced the BT01 + 3D printer, a truly cute baby with great potential.  More recently, this Japanese company presented another device called the FabPod, which for some reason was absent at the exhibition in Tokyo.  It should be noted that bonsai lab works closely with Polymaker in the development of low-temperature fibers, which will bring 3D printers to a new level of development.  Definitely one of the most interesting exhibitors with a cool manga-like device. <br><br>  <b>7. Shining 3D: <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/kupit-3d-skaner/">3D scanners</a> that change the rules of the game (China)</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c8e/9e1/00c/c8e9e100c98746469c4e1e270fea7818.jpg"><br><br>  <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/einscan-s.html">Shins</a> <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/manufacturer-shining-3d.html">3D</a> <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/einscan-s.html">EinScan-S</a> <br><br>  The guys from Shining 3D presented two new 3D scanners - <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/einscan-s.html">Einscan-S</a> and <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/shining-3d-einscan-pro.html">Einscan-Pro</a> .  Both devices were visually presented on displays.  Sunny and Rebecca - representatives of Shining 3D at the exhibition - gave me the opportunity to work with the Einscan-Pro color scanner, and, I confess, I was simply amazed by the results of his work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1ae/4b3/7c3/1ae4b37c35d344868d689bc17b3ea8f7.jpg"><br><br>  <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/shining-3d-einscan-pro.html">Shins</a> 3D <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/shining-3d-einscan-pro.html">EinScan-Pro</a> <br><br>  Einscan-Pro is very light (only 0.8 kg.) And has an incredible scanning speed - in just 15 seconds I ‚Äúshot‚Äù a human face in color.  The software also raises no objections.  The only drawback is that the scanner doesn‚Äôt see the darkened places much like ARTEC, but these are trifles.  In addition, the devices from Shining 3D are very flexible to use and can be operated in several configurations (like a hand-held device, on a tripod, or on a rotating platform). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a2c/d0e/b12/a2cd0eb12c9742a9b7f5cea04ae7c22e.jpg"><br><br>  Manual 3D-scanner EinScan-Pro <br><br>  <b>8. MASS PORTAL (Latvia)</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f53/688/560/f53688560c75405f931c050b959a260d.jpg"><br><br>  <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/manufacturer-mass-portal.html">MASS PORTAL</a> is a 3D device manufacturer from Riga (Latvia).  I did not meet the representatives of the company, but then I got acquainted with their development - the <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/kupit-3d-printer/mp-portal-pharaoh.html">Pharaoh ED</a> printer.  The appearance of the device causes only positive feelings.  Solid machine enclosed in an elegant metal frame.  The models I saw also delight the eye.  The only negative - a very large price tag. <br><br>  <b>9. German printer RepRap and filament from Recreus (Germany)</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6ef/811/337/6ef8113372734e9ab0cb57db430e5ff4.jpg"><br><br>  The German company <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/manufacturer-german-rep-rap.html">RepRap</a> presented several devices at once, including the 3D printers <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/german-rep-rap-x1000.html">X1000</a> , <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/garman-rep-rap-400.html">X400</a> and X350.  The presentation was supported by their Japanese distributor IK Works.  At the same booth, a new filament was presented from Recreus, a Spanish manufacturer of fiber for 3D printing, which became famous for the release of Filaflex - a material created on the basis of thermoplastic rubber.  It seems that the guys are not standing still and are expanding the line of their products.  Recreus is also developing its own 3D printer.  Such are the versatile Spaniards! <br><br>  <b>10. Smile Link (Japan)</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/336/a39/f38/336a39f386b645668b27ead11309056a.jpg"><br><br>  A new manufacturer of 3D printers from Japan presented to the public a device called Nt100, although, it should be noted, they are also engaged in the production of filaments.  Of interest is the fact that their Smile Link works only through the cloud technology OctoPrint, which is built into the Chrome browser according to the standard.  Wireless 3D printer, just imagine!  All my attempts to start a conversation with representatives of the company ended in failure - no response.  Obviously, they are not particularly interested in their devices testing dark horses from ‚Äúforeign‚Äù companies.  The verdict is: you need to learn Japanese ... <br><br>  <b>11. Ninjabot (Japan)</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c58/6fd/45d/c586fd45d78b433fa680119fbfb7bc6f.jpg"><br><br>  Another Japanese brand.  Ninjabot presented one miniature 3D printer under the neck of DLT-80 and one large 3D printer NJB-777.  Basically, this company manufactures FDM devices, machines that use the well-known PRUSA I3 architecture.  The NinjaBot team seemed very nice to me.  Plus, they make smart devices! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2ea/470/b99/2ea470b9959443c99c77cfe3aa59c2bf.jpg"><br><br>  New NinjaBot NJB-777 <br><br>  <b>12. Filament for 3D printing from Kyoraku (Japan)</b> <br><br>  Kyoraku is a Japanese industrial conglomerate that only recently entered the 3D device market with its own filament.  I didn‚Äôt have a chance to check the fiber in practice, I didn‚Äôt find any reviews - but now, at least, we know about their existence! <br><br>  <b>13. Rhombus (China)</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ab6/b85/45b/ab6b8545b00b4888a8e0fe96dfc95119.jpg"><br><br>  Rhombus 3D Printer <br><br>  From Hong Kong with love.  Like NinjaBot, Rhombus presented 2 models - large and small.  The large one was equipped with two extruders, due to which it could print two objects at the same time. <br><br>  <b>14. Carima (South Korea)</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/184/58b/a88/18458ba8867245e88c1a10b373db73c6.jpg"><br><br>  SLA 3D printer from Carima <br><br>  Very interesting South Korean manufacturer.  I have already encountered several Carima devices for corporate customers.  Carima has earned a reputation for their ultra-fast printing technology, which they called C-CAT (abb. From Carima-Continuous Additive 3D Printing Technology).  Their latest development, the DP 110E, also uses this revolutionary solution, which allows their devices to work up to 400 times faster than other similar printers. <br><br>  <b>15. 3D printer Moment (South Korea)</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/28f/9ce/1c6/28f9ce1c6dca4081a67b7205606e764a.jpg"><br><br>  3D printer from Moment <br><br>  Another representative of South Korea with a very interesting brand is a desktop 3D printer from Moment.  Appearance on 5, but expensive. <br><br>  <b>16. iFACT (South Korea)</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8df/53d/2bb/8df53d2bbb1c408496c97eb56003fdfd.jpg"><br><br>  Hercules LCD 3D printer from iFact.  The superstructure at its top also serves to print <br><br>  And, perhaps, the last brand today - again from South Korea - iFact with a line of <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/wiki/sla/">SLA</a> 3D printers.  We could not find at least some information about the company on the Internet, but by all indications - they make serious cars for serious business.  The brochure, which I took possession, contains information about the device with dimensions of 340x190x290 mm.  Hercules (that's what the printer is called) uses an LCD power source with which it photo-polymerizes liquid fibers. <br><br>  <b>Additional photos from the exhibition:</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9dd/00c/ad5/9dd00cad518a42b982ff815e5e67685a.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/997/87c/7eb/99787c7eb2be47dfa321f63e606d28bc.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/782/99c/fde/78299cfdee4940aaba3fd015ca1b5f68.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a0a/bee/7d0/a0abee7d01f14b1185d0e2c84b3e977f.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/356/819/ef8/356819ef8531454d8a85196d3c88431f.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/999/45e/de2/99945ede2b8446ba903346f927956545.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d00/306/93f/d0030693fb3241399a9225da085f9cc3.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c46/e22/e77/c46e22e776d049eea182e331838bc67a.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c5e/f82/eae/c5ef82eae4af49f883fbaa946ff03786.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ff1/a87/d24/ff1a87d24a3c4fd8a69365d9199ed457.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/254/25a/993/25425a993d7145f88a7f4d1442e8a20b.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/468/0fb/fa7/4680fbfa762b45d5b2020c86b8ed9159.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4fe/ee8/1fe/4feee81fe36148a48b6de0bc950a299b.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d99/cba/beb/d99cbabeb3864740945b7a70ebe3e93d.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fa9/1ab/3b5/fa91ab3b55904143ac04d78e2d03ae23.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/be8/50d/54f/be850d54f7ee4e508a8cae8695ba4885.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b8e/899/47c/b8e89947c50e4350ae85c93449cf1f30.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4ad/6c7/c5f/4ad6c7c5fab1407690925019876f560c.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e73/701/8dc/e737018dc3bd4e79a99d9c29b43879b5.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0f8/3c1/ab0/0f83c1ab0ca94e20afe6b21ded2d6ca6.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/873/b7a/95e/873b7a95ec8c4be89850d4eaf9ad9d58.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/76e/944/702/76e9447022c2412b95b4acfd07a7f21c.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ac6/d11/761/ac6d11761388459eb09e834160ad5719.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/539/fbf/93c/539fbf93c5d44c3f8850ecb478c09840.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/77b/776/d16/77b776d168f844f49f31c9601f219d9e.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/129/570/b27/129570b271b446e0841b8ec92c6df0c6.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/95d/26a/e15/95d26ae15f27442284dcbc871cbc11a8.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/53d/91c/508/53d91c50854141a2929447ce9acf1b27.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b9a/0e0/a27/b9a0e0a278ba459789a6dcde7063bb3a.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a26/32c/ab8/a2632cab85f44c2aaf692bf948f152e4.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/712/309/379/712309379f46461195f4adad1a522ff4.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/186/9c3/cd6/1869c3cd66564eb8a8f1a1cb847411d1.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/429/45b/82b/42945b82b22f41a4b6a639d1b73a050d.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/27d/a0a/ddf/27da0addf5244db5aae0b3dd9416baa6.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3d9/db9/ae7/3d9db9ae7fcc487b99d84ad7846d4e39.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bd5/dfa/1fa/bd5dfa1fac244831ab6d3784c1b26269.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9be/7a9/cb4/9be7a9cb499840448d8f587aa6b6bd49.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/81f/6b6/cd7/81f6b6cd737142e593e98171dce5be99.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/350/d0c/d18/350d0cd1801a4e5b9960c5e866fba070.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1b8/f27/d2b/1b8f27d2b19e4cf1b3093363a7477e4b.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dae/33e/7f1/dae33e7f1b27471fb66bdaf45e7d19a3.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7b2/4ed/f16/7b24edf164be4d54802b636c5d01adc0.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e4e/869/3fa/e4e8693fa8484e419c67212c3e79ed34.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/076/940/1a6/0769401a6a8245abbf6f79520800fe67.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b2f/4d9/999/b2f4d99993be4e42bc66a9b725d1ebab.jpg"><br><br>  Summing up, I can conclude that our visit to the Tokyo exhibition turned out to be very rich.  First of all, we understood what a gulf lies between the western and eastern approaches to do business.  At the exhibition, we often had to feel like strangers, who would not be allowed close to individual stands.  However, much here, perhaps, can be attributed to the language barrier. <br><br>  Another interesting point was the difference between American / European companies that promote their brands in every possible way, and Asian firms that don‚Äôt worry at all about whether their product is advertised on the web or whether it will be exported abroad. or forever remain the property of local markets.  The culture of doing business is fundamentally different from that preaching in the same Silicon Valley. <br><br>  At this review comes to an end.  We hope that, thanks to our review, you have learned something new for yourself - or, at least, discovered a couple of new names for yourself. <br><br>  Want more interesting news from the world of 3D technology? <br><br>  Subscribe to us in the social.  facebook network: <br><br> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/top3dshop/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b25/fce/eff/b25fceeffa904b06ba0818fdef351e77.png"></a> <br><br> <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/%3Frs%3DCM_08.02_GT"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/48b/6ce/a91/48b6cea91d604f3bb6d489567c26e8b9.png"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/390309/">https://habr.com/ru/post/390309/</a></p>
