Self-realization and luck rarely come by chance.  They require thoughtfulness, determination, action, and a willingness to drastically change course if necessary.  This book describes a strategy that allows you to plan and implement a career that is perfect from the point of view of success (and, as a result, life) of a software developer. In this book you will not find descriptions of specific technologies, algorithms and programming languages ‚Äã‚Äã- its value is not in that.  It is a collection of practical advice and recommendations regarding situations that any developer sometimes encounters: lack of motivation, choice of priorities, programming psychology, relationships with management and colleagues, and many others.  Such knowledge usually comes only as a result of many years of real work experience.  By and large, there is a bright and fascinating guide that will help you quickly make a career in the software development industry to anyone who has set such a goal for themselves. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

      ‚ÄúI often wonder why so many good musicians are also good programmers?  The reason is simple.  The point is not that the same brain functions are used, both professions are focused on nuances, both require creativity.  The fact is that a person who wants to become great will be much more likely than someone who just wants to do his job.  And even if not everyone can be Martins Fowlers, Linus Torvalds or pragmatic programmers, setting such a high goal makes it more likely. <br><br><h5>  you should </h5><br>  Most people follow anyone's plans, but not their own.  All you need to do to separate yourself from others is to stop and take a good look at your career.  You need to stick to your plan, not someone else's. <br><br>  How to make such a plan?  Software development is a business.  As programmers, we are also businessmen.  Our companies did not hire us because they love us.  It has never been and never will be.  Just because it is not related to the business.  Companies do not exist at all so that we have where to go every day.  The purpose of a business is to make money.  To succeed in the company, you must be clear about how you fit into the plan for making money. <br><br>  As we will see later, keeping you in the state, the company spends a lot of money.  She <i>invests</i> in you.  Your task is to become an absolutely good investment.  You will judge your productivity depending on the value that you bring to the organization or customer who hired you. <br><br>  Think of your career as the life cycle of the product you create.  He is born thanks to you and your skills.  In this book, we will look at the four facets that a business should focus on when designing, developing and selling a product.  And we will see how these four facets manifest in a career. <br><br>  <i>Choose a market</i> .  Consciously and carefully select the technology and business areas on which you will concentrate.  How to balance risks and returns?  How to take into account the factor of supply and demand? <br>  <i>Invest in your product</i> .  Your knowledge and skills are the cornerstone of the entire product.  Proper investment in them is the key to good demand in the labor market.  Just knowing Visual Basic or Java is no longer enough.  What other skills might you need in the new economic environment? <br>  <i>Take action</i>  The simple maintenance of workers with strong skills, does not bring the company money.  They must bring workers.  How to achieve this without getting bogged down in a routine?  How to find out that you represent <i>sufficient</i> value for the company? <br>  <i>Sell!</i>  Even the best product will not be sold if nobody knows about its existence.  How to gain recognition in the company and in the industry as a whole without a fling? <br><br>  The purpose of the book is to show the system way of building an outstanding software development career.  Author <br>  reviewed examples and described actions that you can take right now and that will have a positive effect in both the short and long term.  The author will not talk about how to save work.  If you are afraid of losing your job, then the steps taken to build an outstanding career will save you from this fear.  Outstanding developers do not sit idle.  They are not engaged in fruitless job searches.  Therefore, do not worry.  Focus on victory and forget about fear forever. ‚Äù <br><br>  Book on <a href="http://www.piter.com/product/programmist-fanatik">the publisher site</a> <br>  <a href="http://storage.piter.com/upload/contents/978549601062/978549601062_X.pdf">Table of contents</a> <br>  <a href="http://storage.piter.com/upload/contents/978549601062/978549601062_p.pdf">Excerpt</a> <br><br>  For Habra, 25% discount on coupon <b>Programmer</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/250221/">https://habr.com/ru/post/250221/</a></p>
