  <section class="page js-page"><h1>5 most important characteristics that must have startup managers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In one of my past articles, I already wrote about the key success factors for any startup, as well as how important it is to have a reliable business plan and model.  I would like to add that the creator of a startup is even more important to have a cohesive team to implement the plan.  Below are five main characteristics that you need to pay attention to when selecting candidates to work in your team. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b># 1 Required Skills</b> <br>  You may think that in order to hire a marketing director, it‚Äôs enough just to find a candidate with excellent marketing skills.  However, it is worth remembering that various marketing tools (for example, digital communications, print, television, mail) require different tactics;  that different industries require different experiences (compare, for example, companies selling goods online with companies working with catalogs);  that the skills needed to work in the field of B2C are different from the skills needed to work in the field of B2B (for example, in one case marketing skills are required, and in the other sales skills).  Therefore, before hiring a person, you need to make sure that you have found someone who is well aware of the specifics of your industry, and who has managed to develop a business with a strictly defined budget and a set of tactics. <br><br>  <b># 2 Previous experience</b> <br>  Let's look at the same example with the director of marketing.  Believe me, you shouldn‚Äôt take in leadership of a startup with a budget of one million dollars a manager from the company Proctor &amp; Gamble with a budget of one billion dollars.  Such an employee may know how to create and promote large brands, working in a large team, with huge budgets.  But he has no idea how with his own strength, rolling up his sleeves, having limited means, to set up a small business, resorting to completely new methods of promotion (for example, promotion of a company in social networks, use of mobile applications, search engine optimization) .  Therefore, the undoubted advantage of your new marketing director will be the experience of working in another startup.  In your case, you need a person who knows how to work in cramped financial conditions, and who already had the experience of turning a small business into a successful company.

        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <b># 3 Suitable Environment</b> <br>  Everyone knows that any startup is a work 24 hours 7 days a week.  This means that you will have to spend a lot of time with your colleagues.  Therefore, it is important that members of one team can form a suitable environment.  After all, if you need to work late, the least you will have to taste, if someone starts to get on your nerves.  The situation will be even worse if there is an outcast in your circle who nobody wants to work with.  If you want a start-up business to become successful, you should understand that you simply will not have time to solve such problems. <br><br>  <b># 4 Like-minded people</b> <br>  It is very important that each team member shares your vision of what you are trying to create.  Say, for example, you want to design a car.  In principle, the overall concept is quite understandable.  But if you start going into details, it is very important that the whole team understands that you are creating a family minivan, and not a crossover;  pickup, not a premium sedan.  After all, each of the machines is focused on different consumer markets, will require different costs for the creation and implementation of different marketing tactics. <br><br>  <b># 5 Passion and total commitment</b> <br>  It is imperative that all those involved in the work share your passion for the product being created, and with full dedication move slowly towards their market.  After all, we are not talking about employment from 9 am to 5 pm.  It's about the passion that you live and breathe every minute.  Returning to the example of the marketing director, I would like to note that the person who came to you from a profitable position, who ran a huge army of subordinates, used the services of personal secretaries, turned up huge budgets would most likely face great difficulties.  After all, he will have to work in the field, so to speak, dig the ground with his nose and spend much more time on work. <br><br>  As I said earlier, I would prefer to work with a high-class team on a good idea than with a good team on a high-class idea.  I hope my advice will help you create your high-class team.  As Bo Schembekler, an experienced football coach from Michigan, said: ‚ÄúTeam, team, and once again team!‚Äù.  It is she who will help you win the champion title. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/294074/">https://habr.com/ru/post/294074/</a></p>
