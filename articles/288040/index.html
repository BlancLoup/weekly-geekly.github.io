We gathered fingers on only one silver bagel.  Well, no luck in sports, but we are collecting cool tractors.  Oh, yes, another blog review.  What do we have to read interesting? <br><br>  Blog iConText is engaged in the selection of <a href="http://icontext.ru/blog/2006/02/20/oshipki-i-otpechatki">typos and spelling errors</a> for a list of keywords.  It turns out that offices engaged in the optimization of sites for better indexing in search engines do not forget to include in the keywords and all sorts of errors with typos.  Okay, suppose you knew it and sniff: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs trite, Comrade Khaletsky!‚Äù And how do you complain that our Internet users make quite a few mistakes in search queries quite a bit?  More precisely, in general, almost do not.  So does this search engine optimization make sense?  Here's an article about this, as well as some funny examples of typos.

      MadDog's Blog is sharing with us a funny <a href="http://maddog.sitengine.ru/archives/346.html">observation</a> - it turns out, ‚ÄúMicrosoft made some changes to the user agreement between the buyer of the computer with the installed Microsoft Windows operating system and the software giant at the time of purchase. The motherboard is now considered a‚Äú computer ‚Äùin terms of license. is described in an official document answering frequently asked questions by users about a Windows license. When changing a motherboard, a computer is considered new. "  That is, I translate into Russian - upgrade the computer, please pay uncle Billy for the new version of Windows.  I bow to the gift of some comrades to earn money, especially without straining.  We bought a new washing machine - you will have to change your entire wardrobe.  This is not to sculpt horsemen from mud. <br><br>  The Software Review blog pulls the last piece of bread right out of my mouth and with feeling, plainly, and placement, talks about the <a href="http://softreview.com.ua/2006/02/22/rss-readers">aggregators</a> available.  Calls them dearly RSS readers.  If you are not yet, then I strongly recommend that you read this article, choose an aggregator to your taste and start enjoying all the joys of blog reading. <br><br>  <a href="http://livemarketing.ru/2006/02/13/207">On the advantages of hired work</a> tells the blog LiveMarketing.ru.  Of course, the path of an entrepreneur is more interesting and more profitable, but one should not step on it without experience in hired work.  In this article, the author on his own experience tells about all the advantages that will help you in further work. <br><br>  <a href="http://umade.ru/log/2006/02/184.html">On social services</a> for storing bookmarks tells blog Umade.ru.  I think many are familiar with Del.icio.us, but there are many other similar / dissimilar services in the world of white.  Why not take advantage of them?  The author compares / pits them among themselves.  Well, for those who are not familiar with such sites at all and raise their eyebrows in surprise when they hear ‚Äúsocial services‚Äù, the article will help to understand oneself and the structure of the world. <br><br>  Sky-Blog has a huge <a href="http://skybloh.blogspot.com/2006/02/blog-post_17.html">list of free software</a> , of course, with links.  Let me explain that this is not a bunch of Varese, but a collection of freeware-distributed programs.  There is absolutely everything - from software for working with graphics to Word substitutes.  I began to notice that it is fashionable to use independent free software.  I personally, living in the country of the victorious piracy, do not understand this, but the fact itself deserves close attention and study. <br><br>  AJAX quickly broke into the lives of Internet users.  I‚Äôm not talking about the ancient Hellenic hero and not about the football club from the country of tulips, but about the very Internet technology.  One at least gmail which is on the convenience of work.  Here's a blog AboutDigital.ru talks about <a href="http://aboutdigital.ru/wpr/2006/02/19/jotforms-beta">AJAX-service for creating various forms</a> .  So, if you want for your site a simple form on AJAX, I advise you to read. <br><br>  I, by the way, wear glasses.  I would not say that I have very poor eyesight (-2), but, firstly, it annoys me when I cannot see something, and secondly, I just have glasses.  But Anelka <a href="http://pixeblog.com/pixel/202">sings contact lenses</a> on her blog.  He does not just glorify, but gives everyone useful advice, shares his experience on what to do in lenses, and what it is worth refraining from.  For example, I learned that there is a special cosmetics for those who wear contact lenses. <br><br>  ZOO Magazine pampers us with a note " <a href="http://antiweblogger.blogspot.com/2006/02/blog-post_07.html">Gerasim was having fun in the winter, smashing Kashtanok on thick ice</a> ."  Despite the title, the article is not about protecting animals from the deaf-and-dumb, but about caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad (oh, how the Danes lazhanulis) have already filled the teeth and teeth.  A fragment of an interview with Ramzan Kadyrov and comments by the author of the blog.  Chechen beard ignites, of course.  It seems that we live on different planets. <br><br>  StraNN place begins a course of lectures under the general heading "Linux for beginners."  Already you can read two articles: <a href="http://strannick.blogspot.com/2006/02/blog-post_14.html%2520">one</a> and <a href="http://strannick.blogspot.com/2006/02/blog-post_15.html">two</a> .  I honestly read both, I liked it, did not start using Linux.  But I actually never wanted to betray the windows for the sake of a penguin.  But those who are looking at Linux, but are afraid of difficulties, the articles will be useful. <br><br>  A blog with an easily remembered title Tak ah lah!  Me en Tak opens our eyes to the existence of <a href="http://regul8or.blogspot.com/2006/02/blog-post.html">a DB2 database</a> .  It turns out that this is ‚Äúthe most unknown and the most common, the most powerful and the easiest database‚Äù.  Moreover, it is free!  And it was developed by a little-known company IBM.  Do you know this?  Yeah, the database is engaged.  It is recommended to those who are tormented by wars with their databases, try in any case worth it. <br><br>  A journalist from Kiev, who once even took part in our review, shares <a href="http://ouch.kiev.ua/2006-02-16/462.html">his understanding of criticism</a> with us in his blog ‚ÄúDetails‚Äù.  I fully agree with this article and strongly recommend reading it to our critics from the forum of your favorite ‚ÄúKV‚Äù.  It is considered that there is a ‚Äúconstructive‚Äù criticism and what the ‚Äúnon-constructive‚Äù criticism looks like.  Enlighten yourself! <br><br>  LifeHack.ru again tries to open our life from an unexpected side, talks about a program that <a href="http://lifehack.ru/2006/02/22/zvuki_prirody">broadcasts the sounds of nature</a> .  Do we need such joy?  Does it make sense in your room to feel like in the forest?  Do I need to install this program on my computer?  The author gives an unequivocal answer: yes! <br><br>  Fast forward to virtuality.  The most popular online game in the world of World of Warcraft shudders in the <a href="http://nudnik.ru/entry/3210">wars of sexual minorities</a> with the same majority, and Nudnik tells about this scabrousness in his blog.  It is noteworthy that in the game, where everyone runs in the guises of orcs and elves, a conflict arose precisely on sexual grounds.  And in this case, in spite of all my liberalism, I am on the side of sex.  most. <br><br>  Intruder's register blog author talks about his idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa <a href="http://register.intruder.ru/2006/02/10/vizualnyiy-poiskovik">visual search engine</a> .  I quote the author: "The essence of the idea is not to force the user to learn the language of search queries, but at the same time put at his disposal the power of this language. I believe this can be achieved by turning the search into a kind of play with the words."  In my opinion, quite amusing, maybe someone will take up the embodiment? <br><br>  The wonderful Sunday Bytes blog is asked by an almost rhetorical question: ‚ÄúThe <a href="http://sundaybytes.com/2006/02/19/startup-business-model">business model for a web startup: is it there?</a> ‚Äù The article is large, detailed, and very interesting.  Maybe you are just planning to create your first startup?  Then immediately go read the note!  A wonderful opportunity to avoid many mistakes.  I quote the quintessence of the text: ‚ÄúI believe that the most appropriate way for a project-service (not content-oriented, like blogs, news sites, newspapers, etc.) is a combination of the first two business models in an elusive ideal proportion. For those who are willing to spend ten minutes of their time, and then share their thoughts and / or argue, let's look at each of them in detail and with numbers - to understand how you can still make money on a web startup, it is worth is there a candle game and when will this belly burst  yr ". <br><br>  Your personal aggregator <b>Alexey Kaletsky</b> <br><br>  <a href="http://kv.by/index2006090602.htm">Published in "Computer News" (# 9, 2006)</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/288040/">https://habr.com/ru/post/288040/</a></p>
