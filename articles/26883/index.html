  <section class="page js-page"><h1>"Domain Wars." Episode Two.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I have previously promised to repeat the analysis as the full owner of the registered domains, I solemnly confirm.  My all-consuming interest in domestic registrar companies is growing exponentially.  Choose the best of the best, you see, the task is not so easy.  First of all, each of the 5 registrars who took leading positions in the previous rating are professionals in their field.  Naturally, you can delve and find in each their own some minor flaws, but it is unlikely to spoil or distort the general idea about them. <br>  But still, I am driven by the desire to help Ukrainian users find for themselves the right registrar in order to avoid any problems in the future.  I REPEAT, for those who have not read the past rating: <u>I HAVE NO RELATIONSHIP TO ONE OF THE COMPANIES PARTICIPATING IN THE EXPERIMENT!</u> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Five leader registrars are brought to the public for trial, in which I recently had the opportunity to register one domain name (exclusively for experimental purposes).  I note that all domain names were registered in the com.ua zone. <br><br>  1. TanHost - <a href="http://tanhost.com/">tanhost.com</a> <br>  2. Imena - <a href="http://imena.ua/">imena.ua</a> <br>  3. Redo - <a href="http://redo.com.ua/">redo.com.ua</a> <br>  4. Adamant - <a href="http://adamant.net/">adamant.net</a> <br>  5. UkrHosting - <a href="http://ukrhosting.com/">ukrhosting.com</a> <br><br>  It is in this sequence that these recorders are located in the ranking.  I'll warn you right away that, according to the results of this analysis, the place of the leaders may change.

      Criteria for which the assessment was carried out: <br><br>  ÔÇß Convenience and ease of registration on the site; <br>  ÔÇß Payment (a separate payment option was chosen for each registrar), payment terms, registration speed after receiving the money; <br>  ÔÇß Technical support loyalty; <br>  ÔÇß Toolbar control; <br>  ÔÇß Domain registration speed; <br>  ÔÇß General impression of registration. <br><br>  <strong>1) TanHost</strong> <br><br>  It all started one fine morning exactly 10 days from the date of the publication of this article, when the plan to register domain names originated in my head.  I decided to start my hard business with TanHost.  The first pancake was almost no lump.  Registered on the site without any problems, made an order.  The domain name ordering system is very convenient, understandable even to a pioneer.  The payment method was chosen by bank transfer.  The invoice was issued without a fight (as it happened with another registrar).  In principle, with payment everything was grandly noble.  Immediately on the email sent a standard letter with congratulations to me, as a full client TanHost.  AND‚Ä¶.  forgot about me exactly 2 days!  A variety of thoughts crept into my head.  On the third day of universal silence, I decided to break the dinner of silence and give a fiery speech in support.  With an interval of 20 minutes after my question, 2 letters with apologies arrived at the mail, the third with the settings, login and password.  To all my further questions on service and transfer, technical support answered with lightning speed and diligence, whether because of a sense of guilt in front of me, or because of general professionalism, it remains a mystery.  But, despite a slight hitch in the domain name registration, the general impression of the registrar is quite positive. <br><br>  <strong>2) Imena</strong> <br><br>  With Names, things were much worse.  I will say right away that the registration process was delayed by as much as 6 days from the date of payment for the domain.  If we take into account that Names are the most popular and sought-after registrar of Ukraine, and you can close your eyes to the delay in registration of a domain name.  But on the other hand, I paid a certain amount for full ownership of the domain, and for a week now they haven‚Äôt given them the same right to use, although support honestly assured me that registration of my name in the com.ua zone will take at least 2 days.  My naive soul led to their persuasion. ... For further inquiries and requests, still send me the login and password of the domain control panel, the partisan support was silent.  The second grief for me was the system of payment through bank transfer.  In order to receive an invoice, I needed to provide a complete list of details not only of mine, but also of people who do not relate in any way to my domain name.  Moreover, the account they sent with super protection, because of which it was extremely inconvenient to copy the data to fill the bills.  I didn‚Äôt manage to talk with tech support, and the standard cliche letters on my email didn‚Äôt give a complete picture of tech support work, a spoon of honey still appeased my indignant consciousness in this whole situation: it was a generous gift - 3 months of free hosting for my domain name. <br>  The overall impression is not as bright as I would like to receive from this registrar. <br>  <strong>3) Redo</strong> <br>  Redo is the next sticking point.  I'll start with the bad: the registration system on the site personally seemed to me too confusing, after several hours of wandering around the site, I understood the registration system and payment methods.  Payment is simple.  In cases with Redo, I decided to choose a payment system through a payment receipt.  Except for the problem (or, more precisely, the problem of one‚Äôs own laziness) to reach the nearest bank, no incidents with payment occurred.  All settings and passwords were sent to me the next morning after payment, technical support questions were answered quickly and with enthusiasm.  Throwing a stone in the garden Redo did not work, because the process of registration, payment and negotiations with support left a very positive impression. <br>  <strong>4) Adamant</strong> <br>  Frankly, Adamant had to suffer the most.  I'll start first =) <br>  With the registration system everything is simple: you register, check the ‚Äúavailability‚Äù of the desired domain name, if it is free, you register!  But ... for registration, you must first refill the account, and the variety of payment is not very great.  Top up Internet card, WebMoney and payment receipt.  Choose what you like more.  Deciding to go on a simple path, chose replenishment via WebMoney.  Here is the first problem: payment only in WMU (for me, as a person accustomed to paying only in WMZ, this offer really turned out to be a problem).  Further, it was decided to pay through a payment receipt.  The second "oops."  The receipt format was spy-encrypted, and none of the programs on the computer wanted to recognize it.  Through long dances with a tambourine, the receipt was printed and paid.  Payment - standard banking procedure. <br>  And again they forgot about me, but for 3 days already.  Having a bitter experience, I decided to lose support.  On my note immediately responded, asked to send an invoice payment.  After 4 hours the domain has already been registered! <br>  It is time to open champagne, but early.  After registration, my domain should appear in the user panel, but it is not there.  What?  Again shout sepport "Help".  Apologizing, explain that at the moment there is a problem that domain names are not displayed.  Trifle of course, but lubricates the big picture, and not for the better. <br>  Regarding support responses, I cannot and do not have the right to slander here, since I had a full correspondence with me with a detailed description of the actions.  A place to everything, after several "stupid" questions "support decided to call me back and explain all the subtleties of the domain matter on the fingers. <br>  <strong>5) UkrHosting</strong> <br>  The finish line - UkrHosting.  I did not immediately find the domain name registration on the site, but I did find the ICQ support number, which later all correspondence was conducted online (!).  There I was described in detail the entire registration process, after which I applied all the skills I learned (= <br>  In principle, the registration system is very simple.  Payment was made through WebMoney.  By the way, I would like to note that the entire registration process took about an hour and took place under the strict guidance of a girl with support, which for me every question printed me whole poems.  With its help, many technical questions on payment have disappeared by themselves.  Immediately, a notification came to the post office that my domain was registered and ready to use, but I was disappointed by one nuance: the company does not provide the ability to manage a domain name.  All changes occur by email. <br>  As it became clear, from the cooperation with this company I have only pleasant memories. <br><br>  Continuation and table on <a href="http://domain.kiev.ua/index.php%3Fmodule%3Dnotes%26id%3D77">http://domain.kiev.ua/index.php?module=notes&amp;id=77</a> <br><br>  Link to the first article <a href="http://domain.kiev.ua/index.php%3Fmodule%3Dnotes%26id%3D73">http://domain.kiev.ua/index.php?module=notes&amp;id=73</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/26883/">https://habr.com/ru/post/26883/</a></p>
