  <section class="page js-page"><h1>We accept in pioneers or As the company picked up personnel for a support service</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <b>Prehistory</b> <br>  Cooperating with many companies, we are faced with a small, but very tangible problem.  Organizations pay a lot of attention to marketing, technical development, but do not think about the need for customers to provide human support.  Several times we once and for all said goodbye to companies that could not give us proper attention, help deal with elementary tasks and provide competent advice. <br>  Calls and other types of appeals to the support resembled beating your head against a concrete wall, sometime you can break through, but rather a head, not a wall.  As a result, we stopped fighting windmills and went to competitors who were more willing to make contact.  I had to learn from this bitter experience and draw logical conclusions. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Prehistory.</b> <br>  Due to the fact that in our business, the field of telecommunications, there is still a lot of competition, it is necessary to constantly look for new ways of overtaking competitors.  We decided not to go by the old methods of dumping prices and introducing ‚Äúhidden‚Äù payments.  As it turned out, most customers do not look for the lowest prices.  The main thing is a quality service and pleasant humane service.  Moreover, many began to move away from competitors, motivating it by saying that ‚Äúthey don‚Äôt respond to letters for 3 weeks‚Äù, ‚Äúthey don‚Äôt warn about all sorts of technical work on the server‚Äù, ‚Äúthey talk on the phone in a boorish tone‚Äù.  In general, they do not render due attention to a client who needs tender and reverent care. <br>  We decided to ‚Äúlove‚Äù our customers.  And, I hope, they will respond to us in return. <br><br>  <b>Actually the story itself</b> <br>  I am engaged in staff recruitment.  The task was to find people who would support existing users and answer questions from potential customers.  It was not even supposed that it would be such a difficult task.  I ‚Äúre-interviewed‚Äù a cloud of people, in the end I was tired of wasting time shaking the air, since most people wrote one resume, but in fact it turned out to be only ‚Äúknowledge of the MS Office package‚Äù.  We decided to collect 20 people at once, give them a presentation, and even if 10 will remain for training, and 3 of them will be great for work.  Most of the applicants sat and looked at the screen with a thoughtful look, but all the same, some asked normal questions and expressed wishes. <br>  As expected, after the presentation, 15 people called me, 4 of them sent letters indicating errors on the site and all sorts of wishes.  Indifference is always welcome. <br>  Without such a learning experience, Saport- had to act by trial and error.  There was a lot of trial, more mistakes :) <br>  The theoretical minimum was learned quickly. <br>  For a long time we could not wean our <s>pioneers</s> interns to pester elders with questions that are answered on sites.  (By the way, this helped us improve the usability of sites, now even the most gifted blonde will figure it out;). <br>  As it turned out, if a person writes correctly, this does not mean at all that he speaks competently. <br>  Especially the "gifted" young lady was attached this chair <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b06/e42/00a/b06e4200ac1bc06abced96f958d33404.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  To develop "telephone diction" we decided to resort to <a href="http://www.vocal.com.ua/diction_and_breathing_lessons">this</a> method. <br>  (as advertisements :).  These are exercises for broadcasters. <br>  After a couple of weeks, our interns no longer ‚Äúmeow‚Äù into the phone, and the echoing and backing became less.  It remains to overcome the Ukrainian G.
