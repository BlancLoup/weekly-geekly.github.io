Therefore, our API is very similar to the latter and is designed so that the transition to it takes a minimum of time. <br><br>  Feel for the Ahrefs API here: <a href="http://ahrefs.com/api/">ahrefs.com/api</a> Try, we will be happy to <a href="http://ahrefs.com/api/">receive</a> feedback, analysis, any suggestions.

      The market for SEO tools is wide, we offer our API to create your own services that can allow you to earn. <br><br>  In the first post I would also like to introduce our company to you a bit.  What is Ahrefs.com and where did it come from? <a name="habracut"></a>  The idea and philosophy of our company is to provide SEO specialists and all site owners with convenient services based on our own long-term collected databases.  Only major search engines have analogs, but they are not in a hurry to share them.  The preparation was long, we launched in March 2011.  At the moment, this is already the largest database of <i>fresh</i> backlinks, and everything is aimed at constantly updating information and the speed of its submission (new results collected by the bot come into access within 5-10 minutes).  However, sites with higher rankings are updated more often, so for results for few visited pages, of course, it may take more time. <br><br>  Now we are improving services, interface, adding new features. <br>  At this stage, the opinions of the SEO participants of the world are very useful, with which our services will help in their work, I hope, for a very long time.  Therefore, we will carefully consider and gradually introduce your expressed opinions and ideas. <br><br>  Many of our services are free.  But unfortunately, our services cannot be completely free.  This is understandable and in the modern world does not need clarification.  Free of charge is reasonably regulated by such volumes so as not to strain resources, which should be enough for the gradual self-sufficiency of the project.  The costly and, in general, providing brokers with broader professional opportunities, services we have sorted into paid packages.  Buying them, you can torment the heads of our hard drives a lot and with full right. <br><br>  We first entered the Western market, so the interface is still in English - Russian is planned, but it is being postponed, because the technical improvement tasks are now top priority. <br><br>  <b>We have a separate offer for SEO bloggers</b> .  We are ready to provide a free monthly subscription to the STARDARD package of services (these are the most extensive analysis of backlinks and access to all currently running services on Ahrefs.com) in exchange for your feedback on the pros and cons of our services in the blog.  It is your help to us in promotion, therefore we award for it free of charge our most expensive package of services.  A blog, of course, should be moderately visited, and not written ‚Äúon the table‚Äù or for oneself.  We invite you to participate, for this write me on connect@ahrefs.com or here. <br><br>  Electronically yours <br>  Backlinkedjane </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/124781/">https://habr.com/ru/post/124781/</a></p>
