  <section class="page js-page"><h1>New in 2013 already in Russia</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Last Friday in Moscow, specifically for representatives of the IT-communities and digital editions, a closed presentation of new products in the field of TV and audio, in general Home Entertainment, was held. <br>  I, as a habrary editor of the LG blog, took part in this event, and I want to share with you my impressions of the new LG products, which I managed to not only see, but also touch. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b3b/7f7/f80/b3b7f7f80106fcaf39c93bf8db3072b7.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Of course, the main characters of the event were the 2013 LG Cinema 3D TVs.  This year, the picture quality has become even better thanks to the new XD engine chipset.  3D is now not only an image, but also a sound, even without an assistive audio technology, although below I will tell a little more about a home theater with an incredible sound quality.  And there is a special mention of the design of the new TV line, this year the framework has become even thinner, even in the most budget models. <br>  I will write more about LG Cinema 3D 2013 in a separate review material, and today I would like to talk about several unique products that were presented at this event: a huge 3D TV with a diagonal of 84 inches and an incredible 4k (2160p) resolution, weightless OLED -TV (55 inches) and a new Blu-ray 3D home theater with a nine-channel sound (i.e., the sound is also 3D).

      Let's start, perhaps, with the most interesting - with a TV, the cost of which exceeds some cars.  In the showroom, he was hidden under a silk curtain, and it was difficult to imagine the diagonal of the device, but the fabric slipped off his body easily, and ... you know, the effect was amazing.  Negotiating journalists and bloggers who have seen many different high-tech gizmos, immediately silenced and froze. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dd6/36b/f5a/dd636bf5afe98ac382c03eda76782cec.jpg"><br><br>  A thin frame, an elegant stand and a truly impressive-sized display with an amazingly clear image.  Especially for 84LM960V (this is the name of this model), ULTRA HD content was prepared, which most fully revealed all the charms of the display.  In terms of technology and quality of user electronics, the product is certainly a success. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3d6/e0c/f2e/3d6e0cf2ec39d33e5f9d285c9b805ca3.jpg"><br><br>  Create an LCD matrix with such a resolution and a diagonal and not get ‚Äúbroken‚Äù pixels, uneven backlighting, achieve an acceptable response time, and at the same time make the lifting price not only for space corporations, but also for ordinary people who can afford a small, but real home theater is a difficult task, and LG engineers coped with it. <br><br>  The second impressive result of the creativity of South Korean engineers - ultra-thin 55-inch OLED TV, presented a few minutes later.  It differs significantly in design from all other LG TVs in 2013, the main surface of the display is only 4 mm thick (!), And all the electronics and interface connectors are located in a reliable stand that provides stability to the whole structure. <br><br>  Who will find the TV on the photo - that fellow. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/85c/e6e/a70/85ce6ea70a4c155a40859ce2f2754786.jpg"><br><br>  Hint: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/842/11a/340/84211a340fda3a47fc5642bd33bebf8e.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ca1/03a/278/ca103a278a51c78d3c9cae9a8e016d92.jpg"><br><br>  The matrix, as befits an OLED-solution, does not need illumination, has the deepest black color and stunning contrast.  The 55EM9700 uses an RGBW subpixel system (with additional white), which is why engineers managed to reduce power consumption and heat dissipation at the same brightness and clarity parameters as conventional OLED arrays.  The photos hardly convey the beauty of the pictures on the OLED display, you really need to see it live, and its impressions are not weaker than from the super-clear 84-inch panel. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/71f/259/df3/71f259df3fa98a39df86954d818ed5e3.jpg"><br><br>  Perhaps in a few years we will see the merging of these two technologies, and the next 84-inch TV will amaze with incredible ULTRA HD content, combined with all the advantages of an OLED matrix. <br><br>  The third product is also worthy of mention in Habr√©.  The LG BH9530TW is a home theater that delivers stunning nine-channel sound with a total power of up to one and a half kilowatts, and is equipped with a 3D Blu-ray player.  The rear speakers are connected wirelessly, the player itself supports content conversion to 2160p-standard (just like the resolution is converted for Retina-laptops of one fruit company), supports the latest generation of LG Smart TV technology.  The player supports all modern wired and wireless signal sources and is able to interface with the phone via NFC.  Unfortunately, it is unlikely to tell more about this device: you need to hear it, and you should try new Smart TV functions personally so that the impressions are the most complete. <br><br>  He, like his younger brother BB5530A, is equipped with diffusers made of aramid fiber.  This material, by the way, is used in heavy-duty fabrics for body armor and space suits of astronauts. <br><br><img src="http://kartinok.net/images/2013/03/27/t6gKa.jpg"><br><br>  The characteristic yellow color of the diffusers is due to the aramid fiber. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d50/b4b/451/d50b4b4513000118feb4e90aa4e0a3d4.jpg"><br><br>  In addition to the three new products, the presentation included new sound bars, home and portable sound systems, new three-dimensional TVs and, of course, a presentation of the updated Smart TV system, about which we will definitely write some great material. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/92c/701/6cb/92c7016cbca97a5071b42a93e9d7f184.jpg"><br><br>  The fact is that its update contains many important improvements - on the speed of support of the connected devices, and if you talk about everything in order, you will get a lot of material.  On the renewal of "smart" television and software features - next time, stay in touch, and remember that Life's good! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/174095/">https://habr.com/ru/post/174095/</a></p>
