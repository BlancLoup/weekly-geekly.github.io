How to get an investment, sell a product or service</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> The seller is not the one who calls everyone and sends his goods.  The time of the talking daldonov who take the number of calls irrevocably leaves, especially in a crisis.  Why do buyers buy less attractive products or services, but from a more efficient seller, and it would seem that products with higher characteristics at the same price are not bought at all from another?  I would like to offer my thoughts on this issue. <br><br>  It will be mainly about corporate sales, but this information can also be used in retail.  The material from the series is a gallop across Europe, if there is interest, I can write on each stage. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/47c/1f2/f54/47c1f2f5461f40d8b65566f9fcd6d5cd.jpg">

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>I propose to start with the axioms in the seller‚Äôs head (namely, the seller):</b> <br><br>  1. The buyer when buying does not have the knowledge that the seller has. <br>  2. Properties of the goods perceived by the buyer, can dramatically differ from reality. <br>  3. The buyer wants to rely on the opinion of the trusted majority when purchasing goods.  Preselection of goods and companies. <br>  4. The buyer usually adds to the properties of the product, the personal confidence of the seller in his product. <br><br>  <b>Consider the axioms in order:</b> <br><br>  1. The buyer when buying does not have the knowledge that the seller has. <br><br>  By default, the buyer knows less than the seller, I hope this is no doubt.  Even professional buyers, they will never be able to approach an employee of the organization producing this product by knowledge of a particular product.  They can have a large base for comparison, but this comparison can be based on rather poor and simplified knowledge.  They follow this axiom 2. The buyer‚Äôs head contains a significantly simplified template about your product. <br><br>  2. Properties of the goods perceived by the buyer, can dramatically differ from reality. <br><br>  Templating is a simplification of reality.  It is impossible to know all the characteristics, but you can know 1-2 capital simplified product ideas.  Since this is still a simplification, competitors try to manipulate these simplifications and tie them to more negative factors.  Therefore, sometimes in the mind of the buyer contains the properties of the goods, they received a long time ago and formed by someone it is not clear. <br><br>  3. The buyer wants to rely on the majority opinion when buying a product.  Preselection of goods. <br><br>  All people and buyers from these people enjoy the preselection.  This can be called the brand image or the opinion of a certain number of trusted people.  Buyers tend to trust the brand for two reasons.  1. Some people (if the buyer trusts them, this is much better) have already made their choice and a large number of people cannot be wrong.  2. This reduces the burden on brain activity, do not understand the characteristics of the product and make conclusions. <br><br>  4. The buyer usually adds to the properties of the product, the personal confidence of the seller in his product. <br><br>  This is one of the important aspects of the seller.  Since the buyer does not know all the characteristics, is not sure of their correctness, and wants to preselect the choice, he adds the seller‚Äôs personal confidence to the characteristics.  The following mechanism operates.  If this person is so sure, and he sells this product to a large number of buyers, then the product is really good. <br><br>  There are many books on marketing and sales, and they somehow cover the first three axioms.  Therefore, we will deal with the fourth statement, to understand what confidence is and how it is transmitted. <br><br>  <b>Confidence:</b> <br><br>  Here we take one test subject: 1. A manager - who cannot betray confidence.  2. A manager who effectively conveys confidence. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/668/055/05d/66805505d1f844ed9d741c6a54560994.png"><br><br>  I think that I like the second option more, but how to get these skills?  Copy?  Not an option, it will turn out as with Mr. Stanislavsky, who shouted: - I do not believe. <br><br>  First of all, it will be just ridiculous, the effect is approximately the same when one of your friends, having read a harsh psychological literature, begins to behave like a cool man, and tries to apply this knowledge in practice.  Anyway, sooner or later he will split, because his subconscious has not changed at all. <br><br>  Think you can do that?  The effect can be very long.  In addition, not the fact that you will not be perceived as a pompous talking head. <br><br>  Let's do reverse engineering and analyze the behavior of a confident manager for micro actions.  Let's try to repeat them and train them separately. <br><br>  <b>Installation from the needing view:</b> <br><br>  In general, responding to positive and negative incentives is a basic function of the body.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe brain that is responsible for this was formed much earlier than the cerebral cortex and includes the cerebellum and surroundings.  So it was formed many millions of years ago, it processes data faster, and you can't just turn it off.  It turns out only to catch "interruptions" and redefine your behavior.  For simplicity, this module is called the reptile brain.  I will call her - the brain of a crocodile, or a crocodile.  Just this comparison conveys her behavior very well. <br><br>  If the crocodile sees the prey, he rips it to her without delay, if he sees the threat he runs away, freezes or attacks for protection. <br><br>  The problem is that the internal crocodile is not so easy to override.  He still strongly influences behavior, especially when the stakes are high.  Remember your condition when you negotiated with someone about big money, as an option about salary, or tried to drive to the girl you liked.  Here you are already going to a large company in Moscow City with the ideas to conclude a contract for a round sum, and as a result of the conversation you agree to the entirely compromise conditions that the company has offered you.  You can even justify yourself that everyone works with them like that. <br><br>  A crocodile, if you do not hold it back, is easily controlled by your opponents.  Practically all typical purchases in organizations are inflated with the aim of evoking you the impression of a deal of the century and showing a carrot for your crocodile.  Even if they then buy 10 pieces out of 1000, they will still say that next year the project will go.  Just give the right price, free shipping, overseas training, etc.  etc. <br><br>  The most reasonable solution in this situation: calm, only calm. <br><br>  So our experimental manager, he does not take this situation to heart, he does not take any situations to heart.  He doesn't give a fuck about this world.  It is a simple exercise, observing the reactions inside you and smoothing them out.  Try to notice your condition in the next 30 days and evaluate it.  Better yet to record.  For example: In the morning - sadness, in the afternoon - nervousness, etc. <br><br>  Also, the crocodile can be switched not to the result, but how well the game is played, the transaction process has been carried out, even if it failed. <br><br><br>  <b>Relationship Development Scheme:</b> <br><br>  Any relationship for their proper development must go through certain stages, failure to comply with these stages usually puts you in an unfavorable light, namely as a person with a low level of status. <br><br>  About status: Everyone knows that status is the number of feathers.  But not everyone knows what is perceived status.  If you think that only a Bentley MP has status, then you are mistaken.  In any human team there is a ranking by status.  Status - for ease of understanding, it is a subjective value accepted by other people on the basis of ideas about the capabilities of your person.  Representations can include different things, from character, to a bank account and position on the service. <br><br>  Understanding the status is necessary for the concept of the term - the difference in statuses.  For example, you are in a room with several people of equal rank and suddenly your boss enters.  Notice how the atmosphere in the room changes dramatically, someone tenses, someone can offer something to him.  At the same time, the boss does not react at all, for him nothing has changed.  This is the perceived difference in status.  Basically, if one person reacts to another, then he has a lower status.  In the analogy with the crocodiles, his crocodile is calm, your tensed. <br><br>  Stages of relationships: Stages of relationships begin with the fact that you know nothing about your opponent.  An opponent is usually a person who needs to be influenced.  Those.  make a deal with him, make contact, build relationships.  Here: Get an investment, have an interview, find a woman, get a promotion, etc. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bc0/531/ab7/bc0531ab7cb54d85814cc0c3a86b89b2.png"><br><br>  <b>Demonstration of independence:</b> <br><br>  The demonstration of independence is needed first of all in order to form an idea about yourself as a specialist who does not need anything.  The biggest mistake at the initial stage of communication, throwing at the opponent with burning eyes.  You immediately telegraph your lower status in this case.  You need to behave calmly and naturally, even if it is difficult from the very beginning, try to hold 3-4 meetings with just one goal, to behave as calmly as possible.  It doesn‚Äôt matter if you fail these meetings or not, the goal is to learn peace. <br><br>  At the stage of demonstration of independence, you must show that you do not rush on any deal like a dog on a bone.  That you have a track record.  What do you choose with whom you will work.  It is not necessary to declare it out loud.  If the game is properly composed, your non-trader will say everything you need.  Also required homework, to consolidate independence. <br><br>  You continue the stage of demonstration of independence until a client has an interest in your product or service. <br><br>  During this time you should tell the following: <br><br>  1. Where did you come from in this business and 1-2 of your short success.  Preselection mechanisms: 5-10 minutes, no more. <br>  2. Give a presentation of the product or idea for the service: 10-15 min. <br>  3. Find out what the client needs all the same.  In the process.  10-20 min. <br><br>  You do not go to the next stage if the client is not interested and does not ask leading questions, if the client is removed and does not give feedback if the client incubates time. <br><br>  This means you still have not guessed the needs and did not present your product in the right light. <br><br>  It may take several visits in order to understand what the client needs. <br><br>  You move to the next stage when you see that the client is seriously interested in your offer.  He asks a lot of questions, in particular more questions about shipments.  For example: when it can be available, how much is in stock, warranty periods, how support is provided. <br><br>  Error: Sitting with a stone face, thinking that you will project status on your opponent.  On the high status, first of all, it says a good relaxed mood, acceptable jokes, but without lick-watching. <br><br>  <b>Stage of building trust:</b> <br><br>  The stage of establishing trust is necessary in order to give the client firstly the seriousness of your intentions, how much you will fight for him as a client, how you will solve unforeseen problems.  Roughly speaking, the client has already chosen that he will buy a similar product or service, now he wants to choose you and your company. <br><br>  At this stage it is necessary to move away from the tricks to show independence.  You have already passed.  And we must assure that you are a reliable supplier and will continue to solve problems, if any. <br><br>  At this stage, you will need information about the standards of work, customer reviews, quality assurance of the technical service (response time, network, serviceability) as well as a history of solving problems of other customers. <br><br>  Error: To think that you have to establish trust in order for the client to tell you about the first wedding night.  Not necessary.  Trust is necessary for the conclusion of the transaction and only. <br><br>  <b>Check result:</b> <br><br>  The test of the result is always any action in your direction.  For example: Conclusion of a contract, choice as an alternative or additional supplier, admission to tender (if closed), etc. <br><br>  If the test failed, then a return to the previous stage is necessary, and so on, in stages, before it begins. <br><br>  If you have completed the first two stages correctly, then a simple question is usually sufficient.  There is no need to ask a question of choice, or use some veiled offers.  (Example of a question of choice: can you sign a contract today or do you need a formal sighting by the director?) <br><br>  Error: Some clients, especially those who are trying to create status in your eyes, may promise something just free from something else.  The result should always be tangible, we do not believe promises. <br><br>  <b>Communication blocks:</b> <br><br>  In the process of communication, each element can be classified into several categories.  Consider the Russified options: <br><br>  1. Negative <br>  2. ICE (High Status Demonstration) <br>  3. CSN (Low Status Demonstration) <br>  4. AI (Interest Indicator) <br>  5. IN (Disinterest Indicator) <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Negus <br><br>  Negative - This is negative information designed to lower the perceived status of an opponent.  As a rule, this is not an insult, but the facts noted are presented in the form of a small injection.  The main goal is to point out the shortcomings of any product or service from a competitor, but can be directly applied to the opponent by lowering the quality of the person.  For the correct and effective use of blunders in a business environment, it is necessary to know the client‚Äôs business in the first place, to know the consequences and problems of using a particular product or service.  Therefore, the preparation for the visit and the preparation of blunders, should be a priority. <br><br>  Examples: - Do you use competitors' equipment that is not certified, how much will your company lose due to a wrong decision?  Who will explain to the management (shareholders) of the need for additional costs? <br>  - The current software used does not have the X function currently in demand in the market.  Your competitors are already using it, as you think, how long it will take them to lure your big customers. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ ICE <br><br>  Demonstration of high status - Applications designed to improve your status in the eyes of your opponent.  By the way, Negi is also an internal combustion engine. <br><br>  - We work with a large company ABC.  - Our director visits the Gazm√§s board of directors.  Stories about successful projects.  And so on, examples of such statements.  Everything must be prepared in advance.  Correct behavior is also ICE: not responding to failures, managing your emotions, using and transforming social position in a favorable light - ICE. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ DNS <br><br>  Demonstration of low status.  Statements lowering your status in the eyes of opponents.  As a rule, they are done unconsciously and usually when you do not have a prepared answer to the question. <br><br>  For example, after a question about large clients: - We have just begun work in this area.  Or - We ask you to test this new equipment on your site.  - We will give for free, just try ... <br><br>  By the way, if you meet with a non-decision maker, this is a CSN on your part.  If you wait at the reception for more than 20 minutes - This is a DNS for you and the engine for your opponent.  The inexplicable cancellation of meetings and tardiness is all CSN. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ AI <br><br>  Indicator of interest. <br><br>  As a rule, substantive questions on the assessment and use of goods: - How much will it cost us per year?  - How to scale this service to a company with a size of 45 people? <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ ID <br><br>  Disinterest Indicator: No questions at all or nominal questions to get rid of.  It also includes a subclass of questions on the question. <br><br>  <b>Total:</b> <br><br>  So the larger the company, the more it will initially make you an internal combustion engine and IN.  You are also required to do the internal combustion engine and the IN to the stage of establishing trust, supplying all this with a sufficient number of Negovs.  Do not forget to fill the preselection. <br><br>  At the stage of trust Negi excluded, you can do occasionally DVS- DNS and show the AI. <br><br>  In case of unsuccessful verification of the result: ICE and Negi, and everything anew to get a positive decision. <br><br><br>  Pay attention to the survey, plz. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/246921/">https://habr.com/ru/post/246921/</a></p>
