      About what fintech track Accelerator GenerationS, about 16 directions for the selection of projects and how to apply and become a member - under the cut. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  GenerationS is a federal accelerator that provides technology start-ups with the opportunity to attract investment and intensive development.  The Russian venture company has been conducting it since 2013.  During this time, about 500 startups have become graduates, whose names have already become well known in the venture capital community.  The accelerator itself has many areas, start-ups in the field of new media, and projects from the field of medicine and the agricultural sector, decisions in the field of energy, metal processing are being adopted.  But we will tell exactly about fintech direction. <br><br>  Each of the projects wishing to get into the accelerator will be selected with the participation of industry experts and partners of a specific track - large corporations.  After an extramural examination, projects will be selected whose authors will receive invitations to Startup BootCamp ‚Äî in-person intensives conducted with the participation of leading Russian business coaches, as well as track experts and partners (scheduled for late November and early December 2017). <br><br>  Then, according to the results of BootCamp, projects that have proved their usefulness and prospects are given a start in corporate accelerators. <br><br><h2>  What are the corporate accelerators intensive </h2><br>  Lectures, trainings and master-classes on fintech from Russian and foreign experts.  International internships.  Specialized training on the most important issues of the industry. <br><br>  The final of the accelerator itself is held in the form of a demo-day, during which startups show the results of their work to the experts.  And following the results of these perky presentations, a final decision is already being made on the format of further work with this or that startup. <br><br>  This year GenerationS prize fund is 15 million rubles.  In addition, all startups that will go into the accelerator will be able to: <br><br><ul><li>  launch your pilot project with accelerator partners; </li><li>  to get additional support for the project from 20 investment funds of RVK and the largest banks of Russia; </li><li>  output of the project to the international market, including PR support at the federal level; </li><li>  get access to leading Russian private investors. </li></ul><br><h2>  Project Directions </h2><br>  This year it was decided to allocate 16 main areas, within which the selection of applications will be conducted until October 31.  In general, your startup has a chance if it is tied to one of the following stories: <br><br><ol><li>  Authentication solutions and technologies </li><li>  Mobile (MPOS) acquiring and e-commerce (online acquiring) </li><li>  Solutions for application programming interfaces (APIs) of banks </li><li>  Virtual banking (online banking and mobile applications) </li><li>  Big data and online scoring </li><li>  P2p lending platforms / e-wallets </li><li>  Contactless technology for electronic wallets </li><li>  Blockchain technology (where do without it) </li><li>  Internet of things (IoT) and offline-to-online (o2o) </li><li>  PFM services </li><li>  Banking Chat Bots and Roads Editing </li><li>  Other services and products applicable in the financial sector </li><li>  Distributed registry and automated (smart) contracts </li><li>  Crowd-technology (within the framework of the <a href="http://www.nti2035.ru/markets/finnet">FinNet</a> NTI Roadmap) </li><li>  New technologies in traditional finance (new technologies in traditional finance include such important initiatives as unified banking identification, increasing access to bank financing for SMEs due to increased transparency of government data on SMEs and, accordingly, simplified credit scoring for small companies.) </li><li>  RegTech.  Technologies in the field of risk management, payment control and interaction with the regulator. </li></ol><br><h2>  Life example </h2><br>  Cardberry was a member of one of the past accelerators, creating a single card to replace all discount and discount cards.  Included with the card itself was a special reader, digitizing the data from the plastic and storing them in the smartphone.  After that, using the application, it becomes possible to select the right card right now, its data is transferred to Cardberry plastic and can be given to the cashier. <br><br>  In terms of the project team got about this.  In June 2015, they only had a microcircuit as a working prototype (even without the card itself).  It is with this that they came to GenerationS. <br><br>  And in December of the same year, they began the first sales.  More history of the project and its participation in the accelerator can be found <a href="http://generation-startup.ru/news/stories/26917/">here</a> . <br><br><h2>  Total </h2><br>  If you have a project suitable for the conditions of the accelerator, and the desire to get into it, you only need to fill out the form - <a href="http://generation-startup.ru/accelerator/fintech/%3Futm_source%3D35228%26utm_campaign%3Dpartner_campaign">http://generation-startup.ru/register/</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/339502/">https://habr.com/ru/post/339502/</a></p>
