  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Warranty for ASUS laptops. Subtle moments</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Very often, there are reviews on the Internet about why a different warranty goes to the same laptop or series. <br>  Also according to reviews of my friends.  I‚Äôm not talking about the sellers in the stores, which the buyers tell ‚Äúsuch‚Äù information, which does not cause anything but a smile.  Also, sometimes there are not quite pleasant moments with warranty periods due to the fault of ‚Äúhonest‚Äù sellers. <br><br>  Now I will try to tell you how things are in Russia with the guarantee for ASUS laptops. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  All ASUS laptops come with a 2 year warranty.  The exception was the line of laptops K-series.  Which was originally designed as a budget (inexpensive) series, but productive.  By the way, the price reduction for the K-series just went due to the fact that the year of warranty was removed. <br><br>  In the beginning, the first batch of laptops was nevertheless produced with a sticker, where 24 months warranty was written and it corresponded to this.  But then all the K40, K50 laptops went with the year of the ganthy.

      And then my friend, having decided to please herself with a laptop before the New Year, brought me to several shops selling laptops.  And to my surprise, in several of them, where the k61ic laptop was installed - the warranty was 2 years.  At first I thought it was more like a typo on the price tag or the seller mixed up with another series. <br>  It turned out not.  The warranty was 2 years and by serial number. <br><br>  Therefore, I will tell you how to accurately determine the warranty and what are the main problems encountered with it. <br><br><h3>  How to determine? </h3><br>  There is a sticker with a number of months warranty on the laptop.  Global warranty 24 months or Global warranty 12 months. <br>  Which just says about how much warranty for a laptop. <br>  As much as the guarantee is written on the warranty card, but not in all stores it lies next to the laptop, so the simplest one is still on the sticker. <br>  Or by phone, call those.  ASUS support <u>(8 (800) 100-27-87)</u> .  There, the operators will look at the serial number and say how much the warranty. <br><br><h3>  What could be the pitfalls. </h3><br>  The first and largest stone. <br>  Now the new year is approaching and firms are starting to arrange laptop sales and it is possible to lower prices.  Not bona fide sellers can sell a stale product on this occasion, and then it turns out that you have less warranty for a year. <br>  In your head, count by serial number how much the laptop is with them. <br>  Only 6 months is given for implementation, so if it lays longer with them, the guarantee will be reduced by the difference in term.  The production date is determined very simply: <i>‚ÄúThe production date is determined by the serial number of the laptop, which is indicated on the sticker on the back of the laptop.</i>  <i>(The date of manufacture of the device is determined by the first two characters of the serial number. The first character of the serial number indicates the year of production, the second character is the month of production of this device (1-9 - January-September, A-October, B-November, C-December)). "</i> <br><br>  <i>Example:</i> <br>  The laptop with the beginning of the serial number: 8bn0 ... says that the laptop was produced in November 2008. <br>  If you are trying to sell such a laptop, then you should know that with a warranty card filled out, you will not have the maximum warranty stated.  11.08 + 6 months turns out 05.09, and considering that it is already 12 months in the yard, then you have already lost the guarantee for more than half a year (you can contact the seller with a warranty card for legal points of view, but believe the experience - this will be very difficult for you from the seller, because the repair will be at his expense). <br><br>  - <b>check the completion of the warranty card</b> .  If it is not filled, the guarantee will be considered from the moment of the notebook production by the same serial number (checks are not a document on the purchase of this particular laptop, because it does not have a serial number). <br><br>  In general, these are all questions that I would like to open now, as comments appear, I will try to answer them.  Also in the comments you can ask questions on ASUS products as a whole - I will try to answer. <br>  If there is a topic for the whole record, I will explain the statement as it is and how I see it. <br>  Questions are better to ask the general technical level. <br><br>  Thanks <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/tutufa/" class="user_link">Tutufa</a> for the invitation to Habr. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/78294/">https://habr.com/ru/post/78294/</a></p>
