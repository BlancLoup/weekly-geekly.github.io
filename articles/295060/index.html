  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What to expect from online recruiting sites?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Russian recruiting has great potential for development.  Every year new recruiting services emerge and adapt to our realities.  Among them are online platforms for working with freelance recruiters, such as HR Time, JungleJobs, etc. The latter, by the way, recently received large investments from the R. Abramovich investment fund Impulse VC.  According to Impulse VS partner Kirill Belov, JungleJobs (apparently, along with similar sites) will become ‚Äú <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/18810/">one of the companies that will change the archaic and non-transparent recruitment market and will make it convenient for both clients and recruiters</a> .‚Äù <br><br>  Similar platforms are organized according to the principle of online auction: the employer places a vacancy, the recruiter responds to it, and then works on closing a position.  About how this side of recruiting is arranged, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/aramis.karimov/posts/10207898396645795%3Fpnref%3Dstory">Aramis Karimov's</a> post <a href="https://www.facebook.com/aramis.karimov/posts/10207898396645795%3Fpnref%3Dstory">on Facebook</a> made us think.  By the way, not only the post itself is interesting, but also its comments. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/b8e/eb8/2f8/b8eeb82f8fbebe7348c89633fb69fbfe.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  According to rumors, JungleJobs offers a side job to recruiters from agencies.  For closing a job, the service takes a remuneration in the amount of one salary of a successful candidate.  The project itself takes 20% of the amount, 80% goes to the recruiter.  This fee is much higher than the bonus put in the agency.  The recruiter can get it without interrupting the main work - especially if he will use the information base of the staffing company and paid by it access to working sites.

      This is where the question of ethics comes up.  If the described scheme of work is real, it means that recruiting online services use recruiters from agencies for free access to valuable resources.  The situation is extremely favorable.  On the one hand, the service is not responsible for the ways in which the recruiter closes the vacancy entrusted to him.  On the other hand, the platform has no direct relation to other people's resume databases.  Conveniently, whatever you say. <br><br><h2>  Protect yourself will not work </h2><br>  The first thing that comes to mind in connection with the situation described is to protect our own resources so that recruiters use them only for their intended purpose.  But how? <br><br>  Effectively protect yourself from ‚Äúplundering‚Äù the base, while retaining the face of recruiting companies will not work.  How can you restrict employee access to resumes, if their processing is within the scope of their duties?  As long as the recruiter works with the base for a vacancy from the portfolio, nothing prevents him from finding candidates suitable for an ‚Äúside‚Äù vacancy.  You can save a phone or e-mail in the memory of a smartphone, send it to your email or, like in the 20th century, rewrite it to a piece of paper.  Only total control can hinder this: spying on the employee's computer in real time, search at the exit, system of reprimands and fines - so that they are afraid.  But all this is somehow too much.  Who wants to work in such a company?  Who wants to manage such a company? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/eca/30d/808/eca30d808664e70cb3146920e82bc23f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Already in the comments to the post we see a characteristic position: the allegedly injured party ‚Äúis to blame‚Äù.  There will always be those who say, they say, "there is nothing to be so naive and trust everyone to the right and left."  And yet, initially all human relationships (personal and business) are built on trust.  Is it possible to start a family without mutual trust?  Is it possible to do business with someone you do not trust?  And finally, how to work on someone who constantly looks over his shoulder and hits his arm?  In recruiting, there is nothing to do without optimism and faith in people, and total control cannot exactly solve the problem.  The base of the agency will remain closed to outsiders only under one condition: if recruiters are motivated, self-conscious and value trust more than easy money. <br><br><h2>  Give dumping! .. </h2><br>  Suppose recruiting online services are waiting for rapid development and rapid growth.  The scenario is quite plausible: at first glance, the offer for customers is clearly advantageous.  At the prices of freelancing, they get at their disposal the resources of the agency, profitably solving for themselves the problem that we wrote about <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/ichar/blog/19770/">in one of the previous posts</a> .  All this fundamentally changes the price expectations of customers and their understanding of the value of recruitment services. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/431/46a/549/43146a5499b98f7d5a857d2d5eeff17a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The universally expected cost of recruiting will increasingly be announced one salary of the hired employee.  If for freelancers this is the default fee, then the traditional rate of agencies is much higher.  The collapse of prices, which is very likely with the success of online platforms for freelance recruiters, will be a real problem for recruitment agencies.  They will have to either lower rates, or expand the service, or think deeply about the marketing strategy.  In general, it will take urgent measures and for some time to manage the company in manual mode. <br><br><h2>  ... or poor performance? </h2><br>  If the first aspect of working with the online recruitment service is rainbow, the second is most likely returning from heaven to earth.  So, this is what we have: an online auction of vacancies for freelance recruiters, the cost of services is one salary of a hired candidate.  Freelancers work in parallel in recruiting agencies.  What can go wrong? <br><br>  As a rule, use the services and services start with the most affordable option.  If we are talking about search and selection of personnel, then the first step is to pay for access to working sites.  After examining them far and wide and not finding the right candidates, the company is ready to move on to the next step - to hire a contractor.  However, she is not in a hurry to choose the most expensive option - a recruiting agency.  Using the service of hiring freelancers and spending one extra monthly salary of a candidate against his background seems to be the lesser of two evils. <br><br>  For this price, the customer receives an artist who perceives his order as a part-time job;  some addition to their official duties;  hackwork, which you can do in your free time.  At the workplace, the recruiter is busy with his job portfolio and in passing selects a resume for part-time work.  With such an interaction scheme, neither the customer nor the recruiter is engaged in a job vacancy.  The recruiter wants to find easy money online and slowly sends the summaries found in the agency database to the client.  The client receives a less intense flow of candidates, and the probability of finding exactly who is needed among them is reduced.  The search process has obviously begun, but it is sluggish and shows far less performance than might have been expected. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/f7b/b4c/7c7/f7bb4c7c7ad3b106d0460b655cdcaf6d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Lower cost of services in this case implies a lower level of service.  The agency will take care of the client, answer all his questions and, if necessary, contact him personally.  As soon as the vacancy comes to work, the recruiting company removes it in detail to find out all the requirements for the candidates and the nuances.  Online service of this approach can not guarantee.  Perhaps some freelance recruiters will send resumes from work sites that the customer has already seen. <br><br><h2>  And now what? </h2><br>  The recruiting market is narrow - much narrower than it might seem.  Sooner or later, the freelance recruiter from the agency will be made public, and the client of the online service will find out how his vacancy was closed.  Reputational risks are no less important than financial ones - especially for recruiters, whose success largely rests on a personal brand. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/295060/">https://habr.com/ru/post/295060/</a></p>
