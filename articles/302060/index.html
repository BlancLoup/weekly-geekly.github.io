However, while the city looks like a big building.  Although what has already been built is great. <br>  It looks very good both inside and outside Innopolis University, in which the main part of the excursion took place.  In the introductory report of the university management, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãorganizing the work of this university was conveyed according to a scheme similar to that of world famous universities: Stanford, Carnegie Mellon, etc.  There were invitations to cooperate with the university, calls for the opening of new innovative divisions in this city.  Special economic zone, tax preferences, unique convenient infrastructure of the city of Innopolis - all this should look attractive to investors and help attract intellectuals from the whole country. <br>  Innopolis was solemnly opened exactly one year ago, and by the current moment 27 companies have already been registered there. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c58/734/b63/c58734b63bfc435f8eb7360e476ab191.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In addition to the city and university sightseeing tour, many forum participants were able to take part in the <b>Information Security ASUTP</b> workshop organized by the Academy of Information Systems, which somehow addressed the development of an automated process control system and the requirements for information security measures in APCS.  Unfortunately, to fully demonstrate the time, to put it mildly, there was not enough, and the master class was actually held in the form of direct communication between the speaker and the audience.

      The conference itself was traditionally held in the hotel Korston, Kazan.  The first day of the forum‚Äôs official work on May 26 began with a grand opening.  <a href="">The welcoming speech</a> to the forum participants was heard from the mouth of the President of the Republic of Tatarstan Rustam Minnikhanov. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e03/d39/afd/e03d39afdf4340ebacc048a68980bfdf.jpg"><br><br>  Then, in the plenary section, their reports presented: <br><ul><li>  Victor Dyachkov - CEO of the ICL Group of Companies - organizer of the forum </li><li>  Boris Scherbakov - General Director of DELL in Russia, Kazakhstan and Central Asia; </li><li>  Vasily Dygilev - Head of the Representative Office of CheckPoint in Russia and the CIS; </li><li>  Vladimir Novikov - director of business development for NetApp in the CIS countries; </li><li>  Artur Grioev - Technical Director of HPE Software in Russia and the CIS; </li><li>  Alexey Lukatsky is an independent expert. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0ff/495/c15/0ff495c15e804c3dacd0d709cadc17b2.jpg"><br><br>  After the plenary session and lunch, the demo zones with a total area of ‚Äã‚Äã660 square meters were already in full swing, where their latest solutions in the field of information technology and information security were offered by well-known companies: Dell, CheckPoint, Cisco, HPE, Schneider Electric, VMWare, NetApp, Kaspersky, Huawei, Unify, SafeNet, Positive Technologies, Tufin and many others.  A large number of solutions aimed at solving information security problems were presented at the stands of the ICL group of companies. <br><br>  At the same time, in two lecture halls for two days, the forum‚Äôs speakers included representatives of leading companies - manufacturers of equipment, software and integrated solutions, information security regulators - representatives of the FSTEC of Russia, as well as independent experts, presented over 60 reports broken down into sections : <br><ul><li>  IT Infrastructure; </li><li>  DPC in theory and reality </li><li>  Information security of PCS </li><li>  Secure infrastructure </li><li>  Practical experience in building IT infrastructure </li><li>  Section for oil and gas enterprises </li><li>  Section for banks </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/843/86f/19f/84386f19f7b54274ac7452e6799e12b5.jpg"><br><br>  Of particular interest among the speakers of the forum has consistently attracted Alexei Lukatsky.  The reports with his participation was always sold out. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dc3/809/eb8/dc3809eb8f6a499085133128213597fd.jpg"><br>  Well, a special gift for the entire forum was an exciting anniversary holiday party, the peak of which was the exclusive performance of the ‚ÄúChayf‚Äù group. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ad1/a81/3a9/ad1a813a9da14701b868eaf9968e2141.png"><br><br>  I do not write in detail what kind of reports were heard on the forum, because  conference program can be found on the official website of the forum <a href="http://www.itsecurityforum.ru/itsf-2016/">www.itsecurityforum.ru/itsf-2016</a> <br><br>  In addition, as a rule, after a while the presentation materials can be seen on the same site in the ‚ÄúMaterials‚Äù section: <a href="http://www.itsecurityforum.ru/itsf-2016/materials/">www.itsecurityforum.ru/itsf-2016/materials</a> .  Although so far only information from the previous 2015 conference has been published here, but I hope soon to see the latest reports I liked.  Certainly, all this information, voiced at the sessions of the forum, can be very useful in the work of specialists and managers in the field of IT and information security.  (PS: ITSF-2016 materials have already been published, you can watch) <br><br>  By the way, Alexey Lukatsky has already posted his performances in his own blog: <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://">Russian rasputitsa as an explanation of the future of the domestic information security industry;</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://">Analysis of recent developments in the cybersecurity market of industrial networks: legislation, incidents, directions of development;</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://">Information security based on open source: is there any point?</a> </li></ul><br>  I must say the conference more than succeeded.  As always, ICL manages to organize a conference at the highest level.  The scope of the conference, the generosity and hospitality of the organizers is impressive. <br><br>  From myself I would like to thank the organizers of the forum, ICL, for its great contribution to the development of information technologies, for giving us the opportunity to see, get acquainted with the latest solutions, get the necessary contacts and a lot of relevant and useful information in the information technology and information security industry. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/302060/">https://habr.com/ru/post/302060/</a></p>
