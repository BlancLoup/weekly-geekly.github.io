  <section class="page js-page"><h1>GDD 2011: Developer Impressions</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Somewhere there was a post that the developer is important to feel part of the industry.  Communicate with colleagues, share experiences, discuss with other people proven technologies and innovations in the world of software and hardware.  What a real developer needs as a conference air and not even to learn about a new technology.  No, you just need to communicate with the same geeks, to feel yourself in a technological get-together.  And the Google conferences are doing an excellent job with this task - to give the opportunity to communicate with the same developers as you. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The format of the event is quite simple: 6 streams, which are called tracks in the American manner.  Each has its own topic of reports.  Android, Cloud, Social / Common, Tech Talks, Chrome &amp; Html5 and GTUG stream.  All reports, except for GTUG, are in English, but for non-understanding people there are headphones with simultaneous translation.  The quality of translation is excellent, but the English language from the media is one of the things for which I want to attend such conferences. <br><br><h5>  opening speech </h5><br>  In the introduction, said a lot of words about the main products of Google: Chrome, Android, Google Plus.  About each told a specially invited guest - for Android, they became the company ZeptoLab, known for its Cut The Rope.

    <h5>  Streams and reports </h5><br>  Flows were not equivalent.  No, the same quality, prepared, thoughtful.  But they were not equal in public interest, or something.  On some, the halls were filled with a little more than half, while others were not allowed to enter (I never got to HTML 5).  Again, the technical level of the reports was very different.  Somewhere there was a lot of code, but somewhere just talking on the topic.  Here we must make a reservation that apparently a report with a lot of code is, firstly, wrong, because the level of the audience will be very different, and secondly, it will be difficult to make it interesting and enticing. <br>  I managed to visit the streams of Android and Tech Talks.  Unfortunately, nothing new about Android is not told.  All the same Market, in which there have been some changes, all the same user interface design, all the same technological features of the platform.  In-app purchasing, which has not become more convenient over the long term;  cloud 2 device messaging, which was told last year.  It is a pity, but it seems that the Android team is busy primarily polishing versions 3.x, growing into 4.0. <br>  I liked Tech Talks much more.  A report on OAuth and OpenId is the ideal of a technical report.  Conditions, sequence of executions, code samples, super.  The report dramatically improved my impression of the conference. <br><br>  Google seems to have promised to post videos of reports, we are waiting. <br><br><h5>  Entourage and atmosphere. </h5><br>  What conferences can not refuse, so it is in a friendly non-straining atmosphere.  Compared with the same Sun Tech Days, it is very comfortable and spacious.  Everywhere there are gaming and not only gadgets (however, they are always busy with someone), refrigerators with drinks, comfortable amorphous chairs and, of course, sockets.  Crocus Expo itself is a huge exhibition complex, but even one floor in the pavilion occupied by the conference was of enormous size, so despite the large number of people, it was quite spacious. <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/n4SBabV3p7Q%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhhavpA20gKRbgRcxud530r9A_ua0g" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  At lunch, they were given hot and salad, near the end - coffee with a sweet, just before the closing of the conference - beer. <br><br>  Another distinctive feature is the presence of a large number of personnel specialists who approach people with a laptop and handing their own business cards, talking about companies and people interested in your skills.  Immediately feel like a target. <br><br>  The conference was given access to the Internet via Wi-Fi, which naturally could not cope with the influx of those who wanted to check email at least.  Funny, but in one place there were sticking twisted pairs, and it was possible to greedily occupy the whole channel. <br><h5>  GTUG </h5><br><br>  Google Technologies User Group occupied a separate stream, no, the main conference room!  Simple developers presented their own projects using Google technologies.  Favorite technological combination was the union of Arduino and Android.  It was very interesting to listen to how people implemented useful and just funny things with their own hands, such as RoboWars. <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/RUHFi95Qs7Q%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjVqbk5L3xlvfoFiJiESMOPMJNeSw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h5>  Souvenirs </h5><br>  Almost everyone was able to get a pen, notebook, bag, and T-shirt with relevant inscriptions.  Behind the T-shirts lined up a queue.  And they also gave a wooden yo-yo with the inscriptions "Russia" and "Google". <br><br><h5>  Summing up </h5><br>  Google conferences are wonderfully organized.  No technical overlays and jambs, excellent speakers, and most importantly - the atmosphere of a technical party that is so necessary for a developer.  We are waiting for GDD 2012! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/130329/">https://habr.com/ru/post/130329/</a></p>
