  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Irreplaceable useless man</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It happens like this: a child grows up, smart and sharp-witted.  And everything is easy for him, and everything works out for him.  And how he misses his lessons when, after the first example of a teacher, everything is clear and clear for him. <br>  And it happens that quite the opposite.  Everything is given with great difficulty, everything new is always so confusing that you don‚Äôt want to look at it, let alone understand it.  Perhaps somewhere there are even special people who invent something intricate.  Here they sit somewhere and one to another says: <br>  - Hey, let's think of something complicated! <br>  - Exactly!  - answers the second, - And it must be something new, so that everyone had to understand. <br><br>  I don‚Äôt know what kind of people grow out of which children, however, it‚Äôs quite obvious that adults are still divided into those who quickly understand everything that they reach ... well, or that it reaches them.  And on all the others. <br>  But if in childhood such a division is considered normal - to praise excellent students who are lagging behind to chide.  All arithmetic: grow - wiser.  That adults can not not understand something that you!?  Everything should have an opinion, we can and know everything.  And if suddenly the topic of conversation is not clear, then you can puff up your cheeks, look into the distance, and pretend that this was true for you last fall, now there‚Äôs nothing to be distracted by.  Well, and if someone directly asks, then: ‚ÄúA completely irrelevant question, and in general, this whole topic is too one-sidedly covered.  Here you think, if you divide the issue into components and understand it is already differentiated.  Just because we get another result.  So, I think, we need to study this direction more deeply. ‚Äù  Well, you understand. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Of course, the example is very mundane, but it is very similar to the truth at the moment when people get employed.  Let's see what happens at work, when there are a lot of people like that, and then you work there.

      At first, everything is as usual - you are brought up to date, acquainted with your surroundings and responsibilities, and you start work.  In a couple of weeks, you are already like a fish in your duties, there is a schedule for the week, a plan for a month and thoughts for six months ahead.  From time to time you are asked for advice or help.  In another "from time to time" your opinion is decisive in some matters.  It's easy for you - everything new is easy.  People come to you with a question that has been resolved for several hours, or even days.  For you, one glance is enough, because firstly, your view of the question is fresh, and secondly, it can rely on the work already done by man.  And you are happy to help solve such issues.  And everything would be fine if it were not for the eternal desire for the least resistance.  Everyone wants to do work so that nothing is done. <br><br>  It takes another month or two and timid: "There will be a free minute - will you help me figure out the scheme?" They change for themselves quite confident: "Listen, there is such a task!".  Increasingly, people do not come to get a friendly kick in the right direction, but for a concrete solution. <br>  But the time that inexorably erases the boundaries of perception, as well as the ambiguity in the interaction with colleagues, prevents us from catching the moment when something went wrong.  You still come to work, even manage to do something, then help someone, do something else, help, help, make yours, help, do ... no, don't do your time, you need to help.  And so on until the evening. <br>  Until the end of the week. <br>  This whole month. <br><br>  And now, and the end of the quarter on the nose ... hmm.  Perhaps, somewhere at this time comes the realization: this will be forever.  On the other hand, you like to be in the center of almost all affairs.  It is pleasant to be aware of yourself as a person who can resolve any issue, even more pleasant to know that everyone around you is aware of you by such a person.  Eu-my, yes I am - irreplaceable!  Only one thing hinders from settling down and living on: it will be forever.  And you had big plans to promote your projects, and you also wanted to try a new scheme of work in your department ... and the bug list has not been closed since last week.  Okay, perhaps a week I will not be distracted - you think - I will finish the whole routine.  But - the desire for the least resistance. <br>  Everything seemed to have come to an agreement, everyone is so urgent and complicated that well, well, without you;  you ask you not to interfere, swear not to distract, threaten, take hostages, but all is in vain - by the end of the day your work is done exactly 23.5% of the plan.  Every day you fight again and again for the sole possession of your time, but they will not return to full-fledged work. <br>  You wanted to do your job well and guide others so that they could do their job well.  Instead, you are pulling a big cart in which a good half of the working team is sitting.  Yes, perhaps in the role of a horse, you are really irreplaceable, but practically useless as a specialist. <br><br>  I think that there would have to be some recipe for people who saw themselves in the role of an irreplaceable useless person.  But it will not.  If you see yourself, you already know what to do. <br>  In fact, in this modeled situation, the victim is not our irreplaceable one, but those who are going to carry the cart.  All that they have is cunning and arrogance, which they disguise by naivety.  And these qualities are still good in our reality of the culture of working relations, but they are already beginning to give up their positions.  Therefore, my advice would be for these people: get off the cart.  Go with your feet, learn, understand and understand.  It is clear that in these words there is nothing new - it is banal that I already winced myself while I was writing.  It is even clear that those to whom they are addressed are the last in line to understand these words.  But on the other hand, if there are a lot of these words, maybe enough for the whole line? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/285482/">https://habr.com/ru/post/285482/</a></p>
