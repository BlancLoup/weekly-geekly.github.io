  <section class="page js-page"><h1>He who seeks will always find, but not a job during a crisis :)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  So it happened that at the very beginning of the crisis, I was at a fork.  On the one hand, it is clear that I was mistaken with the current place of work, and that the work, though guiding, is essentially <b>a monkey with a business card there</b> .  On the other hand, negotiations about a new interesting job - the head of the representative office of a small western IT company - come to the very finale.  Well, yes, on the third hand there is a crisis.  He sat, thought, remembered that there is still interest in my person from several companies. <br><br><h4>  And he came out, as it turned out, not at the door, but through the window :) </h4><br><br>  Foreigners with offer said sorry and moved aside.

    <h4>  Are there any vacancies? </h4><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Over the past 4 months, there was a mass of interest in my resume and in person.  But mostly they are poor hungry and feral representatives of recruitment agencies, who have one open vacancy for several agencies and a passionate desire to work, as the payment is piecework. <br><br><h4>  Everything falls, maybe you need to temper ambitions? </h4><br><img src="http://visualrian.com/storage/PreviewWM/3556/17/355617.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><blockquote>  Maybe you need to reassure your ambitions, and as a friend of HR advised me, look for a job two or two below what I did last time.  It seems like the work of programmers and consultants is now there. </blockquote><br>  What do you think now is a strong shortage of former bosses who are ready to roll up their sleeves and encode, encode, encode :) <br><br><h4>  So does someone get a job? </h4><br><br>  If the competition is for 500 people, then should someone win the competition and get a job?  I think so, but according to my observations <b>a fighter is now "no decision"</b> .  The personnel department and agencies are working, vacancies are typing, people are watching, but by the time of issuing the offer to the candidate, the authorities suddenly think about it and ... in most cases decide to wait. <br><br><h4>  And how to live? </h4><br><br>  After all, in fact, an entrepreneur is a person who knows how to make puzzles.  He takes a couple of programmers, one consultant, a couple of vendors, marketers, and successfully or not very well sells the results of this team‚Äôs activities.  Now the crisis, the crisis of entrepreneurship.  No one starts anything, no credit, little demand.  But you have to do something.  So shovels in your hands and write yourself, sell yourself :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/53985/">https://habr.com/ru/post/53985/</a></p>
