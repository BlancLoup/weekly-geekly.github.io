Through which the interferometer could be connected to the camera and the timelaps could be removed.  Intervelometer is such a thing that can automatically press the trigger with a specified time interval. <a name="habracut"></a>  That's what I did then. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-kd8NF5Z4rw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  And everything was fine, but the era of mirrorless mirrors came, which were better, faster, faster.  Therefore, I happily bought a mirrorless Sony.  However, the usual hole in it was not, and my intervalometer was useless.  Googling, I learned that the manufacturer does not provide a wired connection, and there are only primitive consoles that you need to shine into the camera with in front.  Having reproached Sony for the user friendly interface, I remained for several years without a time-lapse.

      Recently looking at YouTube, I came across programming material for arduino, and I was surprised to find that it does not need to work with processor registers in assembler, but everything is written in C ++ and there are ready-made libraries for different occasions.  And I thought that ... <br><br>  There were a lot of thoughts to do, but I tried to think of something useful.  Such that someone else wanted to repeat my device. <br><br>  The time-lapse device seemed like a great idea.  Initially I wanted the camera during shooting and moved and rotated.  But then I thought that the platform for movement would make the device too large and heavy and a normal person would not take it on vacation.  Therefore, I decided not to move. <br><br>  Then I began to choose components.  I took the Wemos D1 as the main controller, because it is software-compatible with the Arduino, and at the same time it has wi-fi and more memory on board.  The idea was to control the device from a phone browser. <br><br>  To rotate the camera took the cheapest and most common stepper motor and controller.  And to control the shutter of the camera is an infrared LED. <br><br>  The body decided to make 12 mm plywood.  Because, firstly, it is rather heavy, and this is good for stability, and secondly, I had it.  Within a month, the ordered parcels arrived to me and the process started ... <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C66vlfjJZzA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  To build and flash the program to the controller, I used Platformio, and CLion as the IDE.  I did not find the specification for the infrared interface of my camera, but I came across a ready-made library for Arduino, which does what I needed.  And at the same time, she also knows how to control the shutter of cameras from different manufacturers.  So, thanks to the developer, I implemented the choice of the camera manufacturer in the application, although I was not going to do it.  I added a little library to simplify the work with different cameras in one application. <br><br>  Then of course there was a long and pleasant time-lapse shooting.  And Ta-Da !!! <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LD37sa3E49U" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  "Open source project, described everything to the maximum, the <a href="https://carbone-kid.github.io/Timelapse_Project/">source code</a> posted.
