  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Alternative education</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I would like to show that, despite the ‚Äúwidespread decline in the level of education‚Äù, there are places where children who WANT to learn something can do it.  Places where they teach not because they need to, but because they want to, where any person can have a teacher who has something to tell.  This article is about the Summer Ecological School (LES). <br><img src="http://www.fizlesh.ru/pic/e50gt.gif" alt="image" align="right"><br>  <i>The Summer Ecological School (LES) is an event that allows the student during the summer holidays to gain in-depth knowledge in the chosen field of science, an environment for the harmonious development of the individual in the process of forming a future scientist-specialist.</i>  <i>LES is held annually (since 1990) from the end of July to the end of August, in the countryside of the European part of Russia (as a rule, in the northern regions).</i>  <i>The number of LES is about 300 people, of which schoolchildren (of different classes, from the 5th to the 10th) make up about two thirds.</i>  <i>The rest are students, graduate students, young scientists of different specialties.</i>  <i>During the month, all these people live in the field camp and exchange information with each other - mainly in the form of training courses.</i>  <i>Classes are usually held in the offices of a rural school.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>At the School there are Biological, Mathematical, Physical, Humanitarian, FMBio Departments and the Department of Laboratory and Field Biology, leading active joint activities - interdepartmental seminar, courses and electives.</i> <i><br></i> <a name="habracut"></a><br>  As there is a lot to tell, in this part I will show what the schoolchild should go through (using the example of the physical department), what would be at LES, and if there are those who wish, I will write in the next one what they will get in return and what happens in this month. <br><br><h4>  Introduction <br></h4><br>  The first thing a schoolchild should do is transfer the application in one way or another (fill out a form on the website, or contact one of the teachers).  In addition to the passport data, he must indicate his favorite areas of physics, achievements and hobbies.  When the N-th number of applications accumulates, teachers (students, graduate students, teachers of physics, MFTs, myths, etc.) are gathered for an interview.

    <h4>  Interview </h4><br>  On a specifically appointed day, the student arrives alone (or with his parents, who are sent back) to Moscow State University, and he is taken to the SAI (Sternberg State Astronomical Institute).  On the way, they chat with him about his hobbies and knowledge.  Then the interview actually begins.  Schoolchildren are seated on a desk at a desk in a lecture hall (usually 17 to 25 schoolchildren come to 1 interview and about the same or slightly less teachers).  Each teacher sits down and asks questions: younger students more on logic and attitude (bus, icicle, etc.), older ones - questions that require some initial knowledge of the school curriculum.  Again, after the first or second question, the teacher understands the level of the respondent, and asks the questions of the appropriate level.  Every 5-10 minutes there is an exchange of students, so that the teacher makes his opinion about each.  Then the students go out and the discussion begins.  Each teacher says his opinion about the student, and pretends to answer the questions: is it adequate?  Want to go to school, or come to parents to get rid?  Will the school be useful to him?  Would it not interfere with anyone with their behavior or lifestyle?  etc. At this stage, either obviously inadequate people are swept aside, or people who have caused extremely negative emotions in the teacher. <br>  After discussion, all students already with their parents go to the assembly hall where they are informed that the interview has been completed and they tell how and where the school will take place this year, what they need and what they can not take with them, instruct on equipment and report the date of the first " access to the forest. " <br><br><h4>  Access to the forest </h4><br>  Before the May students, several students make forays and find in direct reach (no more than 2 hours by train, and from there no more than 3 hours on foot to the place) a place for the camp.  Those.  looking for the edge of the forest preferably next to the river (washing dishes), always with a spring and the lack of abundance of tourists.  For the new ‚Äúfreshly picked‚Äù schoolchildren, visiting one (of the two) ‚Äúexits‚Äù is mandatory.  They take the dishes, the tent (who has them), the sleeping bag, the foam and the clothes.  While we reach the place, it becomes clear who started, who is quiet, who starts hysteria due to the long road or heavy backpack.  Upon arrival, the camp begins to be set up: picking up a campfire, setting up tents, going for water, etc. Then some of the teachers begin to cook, and the rest go about their business: various games with and without a ball, communication (many students only see each other), disputes, etc. So the day passes, the evening comes and around 10 pm the "Candle" begins.  Each in a circle picks up a lantern with candles (to make it clear who speaks, and it can be seen) and talks about himself, his achievements and hobbies.  If on the first lap a person spoke more about his hobbies, then on the second he will be asked to tell about his academic success and vice versa.  So to 3 circle all remember each other's names and have a rough idea about each. <br>  The next day at 9 wake-up begins.  After breakfast, there comes something for the sake of which the "exit" was thought.  Pupils are divided into 4-5 teams, so that students are about the same level.  And each team is given a problem, for example: find out the air pressure in the ball (give the ball), calculate the amount of gas in mineral water (give the bottle), calculate the coefficient of air resistance from something (give a slingshot), estimate the temperature of the fire, etc.  You can use only improvised means (although it is so unlikely that someone from schoolchildren took a scale, a ruler or a pressure gauge) on a hike.  It is here that the creative potential of each child is revealed: how to weigh, how to measure distance, how to estimate luminosity, etc. At this time, teachers go from task to task and watch the progress, send (but do not suggest) if they are completely deadlocked, constitute an opinion about the activity and non-standard of schoolchildren.  Then, in each team, the respondent is selected (usually, the quiet one or the person who contributed the smallest contribution to the work is chosen) and protection occurs.  The guys tell the problem, how they reasoned, what it led to and the results (figures-graphics).  Questions are asked to estimate the error and, in general, about the correctness of the chosen model.  After the defense, all schoolchildren go to play, walk, and the teachers go to the forest for a long time (2-3 hours), a detailed discussion of each student.  The final verdict is ‚Äútake‚Äù or ‚Äúdo not take‚Äù.  After discussion, the children are told what scientific work will be conducted this year, and those interested will communicate with the work leader on the topic of preparation.  Next comes a camp gathering, minimizing damage to nature and transporting children to Moscow. <br><br><h6>  To be continued... </h6></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/96396/">https://habr.com/ru/post/96396/</a></p>
