      1) We are looking for real potential customers and find out the needs.  Ask them the right questions to get the answers you need.  No need to sell them in the forehead.  Our task at this stage is to understand what their problem is, how they solve it or not, and how and where they choose the solution. <br><br>  2) Take the place of clients of different groups and think about what problems they have and how they solve them.  The effectiveness of this approach is significantly lower, but better than text taken from the air. <br><br><h1>  <font color="#5b6166">1. Distinctive features</font> </h1><br>  We need to clearly understand our target audience.  How this avatar is different from others.  What are his features.  What makes it unique.  Think about how they live, who these people are, what their interests are, when they read their mail, where they eat, how they can think.  The better you understand their needs, the better write for value, the better will be the texts on the Landing Page, the more sales will be.  My advice: do not run, this is the most important part in the preparation of texts and a unique sentence.  Spend enough time on this. <br><br>  <em>For example, for a car niche.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>Why do you need a car?</em>  <em>Where to travel?</em>  <em>One or fourth?</em>  <em>Big should be the trunk?</em>  <em>Do you go out of town?</em>  <em>Is there a cottage?</em>  <em>Is it difficult to get to her?</em>  <em>Only in the summer ride?</em>  <em>Or in the winter?</em>  <em>Do I need to carry something there?</em>  <em>Or just build a cottage?</em>  <em>And another 100 other questions you need to ask yourself.</em> <em><br><br></em>  <em>For example, for a niche door.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>What segment are the doors designed for?</em>  <em>Low, medium or high?</em>  <em>This will determine where your customers are located.</em>  <em>Are these young couples?</em>  <em>Single men or women?</em>  <em>Pets may scratch the door.</em>  <em>Children can beat them with all sorts of things.</em>  <em>Do they appeal to designers?</em>  <em>Or do they invent everything?</em>  <em>Or looking for free information on the Internet for design?</em> <br><br>  Different groups of the target audience need different offers.  Therefore, offering different options depending on the tasks you will look favorably among competitors. <br><br><blockquote>  The better you understand how your customers live and who they are, the better sales will go. </blockquote><br>  Think or search for potential customers and talk with them.  All of this will provide information for additional touch points and finding customers.  And not sales are stupid in the forehead, fighting with competitors in the same places. <br><br><blockquote>  <font color="#5bbd72">What to do:</font> <font color="#5bbd72"><br></font> <ul><li>  Write distinctive features (Who am I, your client?) </li><li>  Write all this into a MindMap card in the branch distinctive features. </li></ul></blockquote><br><br><h1>  <font color="#5b6166">2. We define for each avatar problems, needs and motivation</font> </h1><br>  Having defined a client's portrait, one can better understand what problems he has, needs and motivation.  Problems and needs can be written together, as they are interrelated, just then distribute the information. <br><br>  Ask yourself the avatar: <strong>‚ÄúWhat and how do I want to receive?‚Äù</strong> What is my problem?  Am I just starting to look for a solution, or do I need it yesterday?  Why do I need your product?  Under what external conditions?  In what situations?  Do I really need your decision?  Do I really want this?  What do I pay attention to when choosing?  What on purchase? <br><br>  It is logical that different avatars have different needs and motivation.  So we will sell them differently.  Therefore, each avatar should have its own advertising channels, its texts in advertising, its one-page page, its own pictures and benefits, its own sales scripts in ‚Äúits language‚Äù, its own e-mail newsletter and many more its own. <br><br><blockquote>  Only with such an approach you will hit exactly on the bull's eye, crawl right into the brain of the client and whisper: ‚ÄúWe must take it, take it right now!‚Äù </blockquote><br><br><h3>  <font color="#5b6166">Method 3x why to identify needs</font> </h3><br>  Find true customer needs to offer your customers exactly what they want.  Dig the most "SALT".  What is the root cause of the problem?  Ask yourself 3 times: ‚ÄúWhy does a person need something?‚Äù Or ask 3 times a potential client. <br><br>  <i>Examples</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>The man is looking for a drill.</i>  <i>Why?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>He needs a hole in the wall - Why?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Wants to hang a picture, phone, modem, calendar - Why?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Make your home more comfortable and convenient!</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>The man is looking for an interior design.</i>  <i>Why?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Wants to be beautiful - Why?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>He wants a cozy and comfortable rest - Why?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>He wants to enjoy his home!</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>People use a search engine.</i>  <i>Why?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>To find answers.</i>  <i>Why?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>To solve your problems and fulfill your dreams.</i>  <i>Why?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>People want to get emotions!</i> <br><br><blockquote>  <font color="#5bbd72">What to do:</font> <font color="#5bbd72"><br></font> <ol><li>  Identify problems, needs and motivation </li><li>  Add to smart card </li></ol></blockquote><br><br><h1>  <font color="#5b6166">3. We define for each avatar selection criteria</font> </h1><br>  We are going to buy something, for example, a phone.  How do we choose?  First, long and painfully choose the phone itself, when we chose a model, we begin to look for where to buy it.  At this stage, not only the product is already important to us, but also the company that sells it, what feedback about it, how they work.  And the more information, the better. <br><br>  In addition to the ultimate goal of addressing the needs, there are also related factors that are paid attention to when choosing.  Sometimes it can be the smallest details that are of minimal importance to us and are not perceived as valuable, and for the client this is one of the most important selection criteria.  It is the details and the little things add up the overall positive impression and have to buy.  Therefore, all the little things you need to work out in detail. <br><br>  Usually there is a fairly standard set of criteria, but there may be others for your niche.  It all depends on what you do. <br><br>  <b>Main selection criteria:</b> <br><ul><li>  Terms - today, tomorrow, in a week </li><li>  Quality is important, not important </li><li>  Price - expensive, cheap, does not matter </li><li>  Product / Product Specifications </li><li>  Warranty - there is, no, how much? </li><li>  Result - what will I get? </li><li>  Payment options - cash, non-cash, loan, installment plan, prepayment </li></ul><br>  What else could be: <br><ul><li>  Product features </li><li>  Design </li><li>  Professional staff </li><li>  Turnkey made </li><li>  And other criteria that are important in your niche </li></ul><br><blockquote>  If you don‚Äôt try to find out or don‚Äôt know your avatars, you‚Äôll sell around as well. </blockquote><br><blockquote>  <font color="#5bbd72">What to do:</font> <font color="#5bbd72"><br></font> <ol><li>  Identify all main selection criteria </li><li>  Add to smart card </li></ol></blockquote><br><br><h1>  <font color="#5b6166">4. Additional factors</font> </h1><br>  Additional factors are factors that are not directly related to the choice of product / product / service, but affect the decision-making process.  Yes, they are not paramount, but nevertheless have an impact on the decision-making process about the purchase. <br><br>  For example, I often talk to people to find out what should be the reviews about the product or company and how many they should be, so that everyone likes it and the person decides to buy.  And a lot of opinions.  Some will never buy a product from a company, if 100% of the company's reviews are only positive, for them it is a signal - ‚Äúsomething is wrong here.‚Äù  Others, on the contrary, are looking for an ideal company.  For the third there is a ratio of bad and good reviews. <br><br><blockquote>  <font color="#5bbd72">What to do?</font> <font color="#5bbd72"><br></font> <ol><li>  Define additional selection criteria </li><li>  Add to smart card </li></ol></blockquote><br><br>  It should end up with something like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a51/042/634/a510426342d04b4dbd6c7aab5f791db9.png"><br><br>  <b>Tips, where you can search for your target audience and interrogate it:</b> <br><ul><li>  Groups in social networks (VKontakte, facebook, classmates, etc.) </li><li>  Competitors in social networks </li><li>  Subject Forums </li><li>  Profile thematic resources </li><li>  Conferences </li><li>  Shopping centers </li></ul><br>  To make people willing to go on a dialogue, in return, one should offer some value.  It can be a solution to their problem, expert in something, and any other snack that is valuable to the client.  To survey 10 potential customers, you need to find 100. So be prepared. <br><br><h1>  <font color="#5b6166">How to choose the right avatar to start?</font> </h1><br>  For an effective and quick start, I advise you to choose one avatar first.  So you can not spend a lot of time on the creation of several landing pages and immediately get a good result. <br><br>  <b>Criteria for choosing an avatar:</b> <br><ul><li>  How common is this avatar?  The number of potential customers in the network, the more the better. </li><li>  How much can you earn from each client?  The bigger, the better. </li><li>  How fast can you get money from it?  The faster the better. </li><li>  Experience interacting with avatars.  You already understand what they need, which means they know better ‚Äúfrom which side to approach‚Äù in order to sell. </li></ul><br>  For each avatar you need your own separate landing page with your own unique texts!  It is necessary to highlight avatars whose features, needs and criteria are similar to 70% or more, and combine them into groups.  And then work with these groups. <br><br><blockquote>  <font color="#5bbd72">What to do?</font> <font color="#5bbd72"><br></font> <ol><li>  Combine similar avatars, if any </li><li>  Apply changes to MimdMap map </li></ol></blockquote><br><br><h1>  <font color="#5b6166">Determine customer benefits</font> </h1><br>  The benefit is what exactly I will get as a customer.  What value will I get if I work with you.  People do not like to invent and think out for you.  The brain is lazy, people are lazy, I do not want to think.  Therefore, when you describe the benefits in the form of what the client receives, you immediately put the answer to the visitor in the head, without his extra gestures.  Do you think he will be grateful to you for this?  Of course!  Therefore, the needs of customers should always be remembered and put them in the first place.  What a person wants is to offer him!  And forget what you want. <br><br>  Benefit is a kind of response to customer questions that are embedded in their needs. <br><br>  <b>Example for needs</b> <br>  <i>Requirement - Benefit (Writing based on needs)</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>A man wants a big car - it means he will get a big car.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>He wants a beautiful and warm fireplace - he will get a beautiful and warm fireplace.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Wants to raise sales in business - will raise sales in business.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Wants to learn how to cook - learn how to cook.</i> <br><br><blockquote>  <font color="#5bbd72">What to do:</font> <font color="#5bbd72"><br></font> <ol><li>  Write benefits based on customer needs </li><li>  Add to smart card </li></ol></blockquote><br>  When we choose a product, we pay attention not only to the ultimate goal of our need, but also to certain additional factors.  For example, when buying meat, your need to cook and satisfy hunger, but an important factor in making choices is meat, freshness and quality.  When buying a bicycle, we first determine why we need it and select it based on the objectives.  And then we choose the store, for quality, delivery time, price, reviews.  So these minor factors have a strong influence when choosing a place of purchase. <br><br>  It is important to close the benefits of each selection criterion. <br><br>  <b>Example for criteria</b> <br>  <i>Example - Benefit (Writing based on criteria)</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>I want to quickly - get in an hour.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Terms - we will make in a week, delivery in 2 hours, a call in 15 minutes, installation in 1 day.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Convenience - we will come ourselves, we will show it ourselves, we will do it ourselves.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Quality - production in ..., 2 years warranty, certified in Russia, 6 months free maintenance.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Price - discount, free shipping, something as a gift</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Characteristics of the product / product.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Warranty - money back, certificates, work experience.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Speed ‚Äã‚Äã- credit, get it quickly, we will call you back in 15 minutes, we will arrive in 30 minutes.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>The result of use is not clear - such result will be after purchase, work with us.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Payment options - cash, non-cash.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Made turnkey - We will do everything for you.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Etc.</i> <br><br>  Benefits should EXACTLY close the needs and selection criteria in order to exactly match what customers need!  And not what you want them to say and offer. <br><br><blockquote>  <font color="#5bbd72">What to do:</font> <font color="#5bbd72"><br></font> <ol><li>  Write 3 - 5 benefits per selection criteria </li><li>  Add to smart card. </li></ol></blockquote><br><br><h1>  <font color="#5b6166">Other side of the coin</font> </h1><br>  All this time, we proceeded from the needs of avatars, but we can and should go from the other side.  These are unique properties of a product, company, supplier or person.  We are telling here about ourselves, how well done we are, what cool technologies we have, what unique properties, what and how we can do. <br><br>  <b>The uniqueness of the product</b> , it may be, for example: <br><ul><li>  Official dealer </li><li>  Official service </li><li>  Innovative technologies (Non-soiling surface, thanks to new nano-technologies) </li><li>  Professional staff, 10 years experience </li><li>  Brand Reliability </li><li>  Child safety </li><li>  Unique strategy / technology that guarantees results </li><li>  Etc. </li></ul><br><br>  <b>The uniqueness of the supplier or person</b> , it may be, for example: <br><ul><li>  The only technology in the world </li><li>  Official supplier </li><li>  High performance of your students or clients </li><li>  Expertise recognized by others </li><li>  We produce only, there are no analogues </li><li>  Etc. </li></ul><br>  Of course, all information should be real, and not sucked from the finger. <br><br><blockquote>  <font color="#5bbd72">What to do:</font> <ol><li>  Write 10 company, supplier or product benefits </li><li>  Add to smart card </li></ol></blockquote><br>  Congratulations!  Have done one of the most difficult work.  In the next step, we will test the merchantability of our benefits.  Find out which of them will sell at maxim.  I'll tell you how to find competitors and how to turn them into laggards. <br><br>  Was there something useful?  Put a plus and tell in social.  networks.  So we see that this article is not written in vain. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297082/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297082/</a></p>
