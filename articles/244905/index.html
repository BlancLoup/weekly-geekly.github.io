  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Preprocessors and meta-languages ‚Äã‚Äãin error correction programs</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Computational linguistics is very conservative, despite the huge number of already created programs that solve very complex problems of preprocessing targeted languages ‚Äã‚Äã(such programs are rarely used in spell checkers).  Further, using the example of the generally accepted "difficult" case of adjusting "tsya" and "tsya", I will try to show how the "conservatism" of programmers leads to a specific class of errors. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  A. Reformatsky, being a very shrewd linguist, wrote that there are mistakes as a result of inept teaching in the school of grammar.  Alpatov, a venomous man, remarked, I quote: ‚Äúone can say, Russian grammar took as its basis the submission of Petersburg Germans about the Russian language‚Äù.  Considering the defects in school teaching and the psychological specifics of the compilers of grammars, they remain outcasts in computer spell checkers. <br><br>  Apparently, these cases are also obliged to their gloomy glory by the fact that the grammars strongly recommend to ‚Äúcheck‚Äù the correctness of the spelling with questions ‚Äúwhat to do‚Äù and ‚Äúwhat does‚Äù, excluding other methods.  Of course, if we proceed in the recommended way, no algorithmization and subsequent adjustment are possible.  Only the ‚Äúanagrammatic approach‚Äù remains (when we get several variants of the ‚Äúcorrected‚Äù word at the output of the program).  Apparently, hence the attempt to divide the SA  Krylov programs for purist and laxist. <br><br>  The "obsession" of programmers working in a team with professional linguists on the analysis of sentences is obviously connected with the lack of understanding of the principles of programming by linguists and the "imposition" of linguistic ideas on programmers.  And here the respected S. A. Krylov demonstrates this - see a <a href="http://forum.dialog-21.ru/actualthread.aspx%3Ftid%3D370">post</a> on a well-known forum.  This is a linguistic view, but not a programmer‚Äôs view, for which other questions remain important: whether it is possible to algorithmize a grammar rule or algorithmization is impossible, you should use a ‚Äúvocabulary‚Äù approach to verify a word. <br>  Editing the erroneous spelling of reflexive verbs is surprisingly easy in 40% (or more) cases, if you give up ‚Äúwhat does, what to do‚Äù, and understand the reflexive verb exactly as it should, by meaning: reflexive proper;  reciprocal;  objectless return;  general return &amp; etc.  In this case, the task of correcting a word is reduced to a) ‚Äúpreprocessing‚Äù processing of a phrase, a word;  b) creating the simplest metalanguage that allows using certain descriptions for the ‚Äúrules‚Äù, and this metalanguage will look like a classic stream editor, that is, a well-known class of programs.

      So, let the "fuel" for the "preprocessor" we will have an array of seven (or less) of the last letters of the words nah and tsya (for example, take the dictionary Zaliznyak).  If you take a larger number of letters, the "accuracy" will increase, it is obvious. <br>  We will place the received data in an array according to the ‚Äúherringbone roots in the sky‚Äù principle - this optimizes and speeds up the search, as well as eliminates possible errors (see the code). <br><br>  If someone dares to repeat my experiment with Zaliznyak's dictionary, the result is hardly surprising: in such an array there will be only 3,548 endings (that is, seven or less of the last letters in a word) when it is uniquely spelled or typed.  The number of endings, where the alternation of "ts" / "ts" is possible is just as small - only 407. Surprisingly, right?  After all, now it is enough to ‚Äúdrive out‚Äù the tested word through the arrays and we will get rid of incorrect spellings of words like ‚Äúseem‚Äù, ‚Äúcome‚Äù, etc.  and the notorious "anagrams."  (For the second array, when spelling variations are possible, you will need to use the "metalanguage".) <br><br>  This is how the array ‚Äúonly one option is possible‚Äù (of course, these are several lines from 3548): <br><br>  // "Herringbone in the sky" <br>  For me, the erroneous spelling is before the delimiter, and then the correct one. <br>  to look out :: look out <br>  yachat :: yachting <br>  yatatsya :: yata <br>  go on <br>  is here :: is found <br>  go :: go <br>  rtsya :: rtsya <br>  Complete <br>  get here <br><br>  For me, the erroneous spelling is before the delimiter, after it is the correct one: <br><br>  are yachting <br>  is coming :: looking <br>  ridya :: ridya <br>  zeyutsya :: zeyutsya <br>  see :: see <br>  sound :: sound <br>  to ring :: rut <br>  oyutya :: oatsya <br>  oetsya :: oetsya <br>  come on <br><br>  // Array for cases when it is impossible to determine the correct spelling (last, but obviously, you just need to insert a soft sign) <br><br>  it is done <br>  flakes <br>  cramp <br>  suck <br>  is learning <br>  merge <br>  thinks <br>  is about <br>  stumble <br>  sting <br>  are <br>  is eating <br>  utsya <br>  is <br>  is it <br>  is <br>  atsya <br><br>  For example, a simple code that allows you to search for matches in the databases: <br><br><pre><code class="hljs lua"><span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">string</span></span> correction_verbs(<span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">string</span></span> str) { //    map,   map    vector &lt; pair &lt; <span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">string</span></span>, <span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">string</span></span> &gt; &gt;data; vector &lt; pair &lt; <span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">string</span></span>, <span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">string</span></span> &gt; &gt;::iterator it; //     ,    . file_operations file_io; //          string_utilities str_ut; //  ,    replace_all <span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">string</span></span> first_str, second_str, separator; //          <span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">string</span></span> verbs = global::file_paths.<span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">find</span></span>(<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"verbs_cfg"</span></span>)-&gt;second; data = file_io.readf_vector_pair(verbs, separator); <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">for</span></span> (it = data.begin(); it != data.<span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">end</span></span>(); ++it) { //     (  )    first_str = it-&gt;first; //   second_str = it-&gt;second; //  //     //   ,      ( ) <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span></span> (str.<span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">find</span></span>(second_str) != <span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">string</span></span>::npos) { str = str_ut.replace_all(str, second_str, first_str); //    <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">break</span></span>; } } //   data.clear(); <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">return</span></span> str; }</code> </pre> <br><br>  Despite the obvious solution that is often used in programming, for example, in the analysis of artificial languages, Orfo‚Äôs linguistic program presented on the market (not the most unsuccessful, perhaps even perfect in many ways) is unable to fully solve the task: it doesn‚Äôt have a ‚Äúpreprocessor‚Äù , instead of the ‚Äúpreprocessor‚Äù, the same notorious anagrammatic ‚Äúdistance calculation‚Äù algorithms are used, which inevitably ‚Äúcompelling‚Äù Orfo to propose some crazy versions of edits. <br><br>  Look here: <a href="http://online.orfo.ru/">online.orfo.ru</a> <br>  We enter the phrase with the error: "we have to correct the error." <br>  At the exit, we get, as expected, the following passage: dress up, have to, get used to, thread, get close. <br>  Draw your own conclusions. <br>  (Perhaps, a worthy example of how linguists "bent" programmers, having received an incomplete and illiterate solution at the output.) <br><br>  Let's look at the work of the above preprocessor.  In the variable str we will have the word "have to".  In the array there will be only reflexive verbs ‚Äúwith unambiguous spelling‚Äù.  At the output we get (the program is looking for matches by the last letters, starting from the top of the array) the word, where the view is definitely replaced by (see the database, there are no other options).  If the program does not find matches in the array, the function will return the word unchanged.  Of course, further should be checked in the database "tsya" / "tsya", using a certain set of descriptions.  But I will write about ‚Äúmetalanguages‚Äù in such linguistic programs in the next post, so that the message doesn't get cumbersome. <br><br>  PS Of course, the "preprocessing" processing has its drawbacks, but the program "thinks like a human being", but the output is still a more sane result. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/244905/">https://habr.com/ru/post/244905/</a></p>
