In essays, in the biographies of talented People with a capital letter, we derive information not only about a person, a person, but also about the development of history, valuable achievements of that time. <br><br>  At the beginning of the second half of the twentieth century, cybernetics was considered (as it would not have been wondrous now) to be "bourgeois pseudoscience".  Conservatism of scientists, physicists and mathematicians made it difficult to perceive the importance of cybernetic models in the creation of control systems for complex objects.  And this article will focus on Axel Ivanovich Berg, whose life and merits are invaluable in the development of cybernetics, its development as a science. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/59b/31f/b42/59b31fb424154422a5cbcc40d87dcf6b.jpg">

      <i>"Cybernetics is a science that has great prospects, it is looking far ahead, and therefore ensuring the management in the best way becomes for her an increasingly important goal."</i> <br><br>  Nobleman, midshipman, naval officer, first specialist submariner, later - teacher, professor, deputy people's commissar of electrical industry, deputy chairman of the Radar Board at the Civil Code of Defense, academician, deputy minister of defense of the USSR, admiral-engineer, director of the institute, distinguished scientist Axel Berg The founder of the Council on Cybernetics, the center for organizing and conducting the most important theoretical and applied work in various areas of cybernetics for over 20 years, was an authoritative scientist who clearly  an isolated main task of cybernetics, thanks to his determination and energy were generated work on cybernetics and computer science in Russia. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  As Berg believed, cybernetics should be an interdisciplinary science, from where different sciences could borrow general models and methods of research.  Not only cybernetics, but also scientific fields such as structural linguistics, semiotics, bionics, information theory, programmed instruction, mathematical theory of experiment, chemical cybernetics were grown under the roof of the Scientific Council. <br><blockquote>  The task of cybernetics is to increase the efficiency of human activity in all cases when it needs to be managed. </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c2e/5c4/a9e/c2e5c4a9e99341db888f44dbd0805182.jpg"><br><br>  Berg was an opponent of full automation in management.  More than once, he argued that even a computer, even if equipped with a super-intellectual program, would not replace a person, but would only play the role of a ‚Äúhuman intelligence amplifier‚Äù.  The ideas and principles of Axel Ivanovich are relevant in our modern society, the existence of which is unthinkable without the use of methods and means of information processing, ... "grown on the basis of cybernetics." <br><br>  The Scientific Council on Cybernetics has united a large number of scientists from various scientific and educational institutions of the USSR.  Already in the 1960s ‚Äì 1970s, for the benefit of the fatherland, there were 16 sections headed by leading experts of the country; there was also a section on mathematical questions of cybernetics, and a section of the computing system, a section of chemical cybernetics, an artificial intelligence section, numerous scientific conferences and seminars were held schools. <br><br><h3>  From biography </h3><br>  In Orenburg, back in 1893, Axel Ivanovich Berg was born on November 10th.  His parents: his father is a Russian general of Swedish origin, Johann Aleksandrovich Berg, the mother of the half-Italian half-intelligence agent, Elizaveta Kamillovna Bertoldi, later worked as the head of a girls' gymnasium in Tsarskoe Selo.  Axel Ivanovich himself always considered Russian.  At the age of 6 he was left without a father, who instilled in Axel a love for books, music, drawing, and rare books. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/63c/37c/b6d/63c37cb6d3cf42f6b0bd36ea25b63dd1.png"><br><br>  This is how Axel Ivanovich wrote about his mother: <br><br>  ‚ÄúIn Orenburg,‚Äù Axel Ivanovich recalled, ‚Äúshe was a very young woman ‚Äî beautiful, charming.  And already then she was a central figure of society.  This is not the usual general's wife, she has never been a layman, a make-believe.  Sensible, educated, she was fond of Schopenhauer, Spencer, Bokle, Vladimir Solovyov and instilled in children a love for thinking, for analysis.  She always did something, although we, of course, had a servant.  I made sure that we did not hang out, but did something useful.  Girls knit, embroidered or practiced in languages ‚Äã‚Äãand playing the piano.  We have always reigned loose business atmosphere.  Mother created a special style of relationships.  And it had tremendous significance for me.  After all, the character is formed in early childhood.  Such an environment instilled in children the very best skills.  No one lied.  You know, when I first learned that people could lie, I was very surprised, I was not prepared for this.  I have not suspected for a long time that there are bad people in the world.  I don‚Äôt remember having scandals among us, making noises for anyone to gossip or drink, except for unfortunate Alexander - my stepbrother. ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e0e/ccc/f16/e0ecccf16042403aa62725d62d762274.png"><br>  <i>Elizaveta Kamillovna Bertoldi</i> <br><br>  After the death of his father, left alone with three children, the mother was forced to move to Vyborg with her husband's sister.  But, later moved to the parents of Elizabeth in St. Petersburg.  Life is slowly getting better. <br><br>  Axel Ivanovich became a frequent guest in the house of R.R.  Betlingka, State Counselor, a doctor by profession, well-known therapist in St. Petersburg.  Axel liked to visit his house, there were solid bookcases in Betlingka‚Äôs office, paintings hung around the house, there were sculptures, Berg took with him rare books that could not be obtained in the library of the Marine Corps from Betlingen. <br><br>  At R.R.  Betlingka had two daughters.  With younger Ellionora Rudolfovnoy Betlingk in the winter in 1914, Berg was married in the Lutheran Church of St. Peter and Paul, Petrikirche, on Nevsky Prospect. <br><br>  In 1914, Berg graduated from the special classes of the Marine Corps in St. Petersburg, served as a junior navigator on the battleship Tsesarevich, beginning in 1919, Berg served in the submarine navigator of the submarine Panther, then commander of the submarines Rys, Wolf "," Snake ". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/507/7d5/06a/5077d506ab8447aeb7a42786118c0e44.png"><br>  <i>battleship Tsesarevich</i> <br><br>  Berg recalled about the Snake submarine: ‚ÄúThis boat was special,‚Äù said Axel Ivanovich, ‚Äúwith a three thousand engine.  She did not participate in the war - they were late with the surrender, was unfinished, in reserve.  We finished it with our own hands. ‚Äù  For his work in restoring the submarine and bringing it to combat readiness, Berg was awarded the title of Hero of Labor of the Separate Division of Submarines of the Baltic Sea. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d3c/5dc/37c/d3c5dc37c89d416c8ff073d58c678608.png"><br>  <i>submarine "Snake"</i> <br><br>  Passion for radio communications began at a time when he served as a navigator on the English submarine E-8.  It was there that he became acquainted with hardware radio communications.  Berg was poisoned by sulfurous gases on the E-8 submarine, which stood out from the burned winding of the left main electric motor in the submerged position of the boat at about.  Gotland, was decommissioned in Helsingfors <br>  hospital because of shaky health ,. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5e7/a3b/04b/5e7a3b04bb004c6091a243ede2085588.png"><br>  <i>submarine E-8</i> <br><br>  In 1923, Axel Ivanovich graduated from the Naval Engineering School and received a degree in Electrical Engineering. <br><br>  ‚ÄúIt was in the Marine Corps that I was taught to conduct experiments,‚Äù said Axel Ivanovich, ‚Äúand assess the accuracy of the results obtained.  We now call this skill information gathering ... I have never been keen on artillery, torpedoes and mines, but I was very interested in astronomy, sailing, navigation and other navigational disciplines.  I dreamed of becoming a navigator.  The best marine scientists, including such outstanding ones as Shokalsky and Krylov, taught at the Marine Corps.  Their attitude towards the assigned case obliged the cadet guys to work at full load. ‚Äù <br><br>  He graduated from the Naval Academy, specializing in radio engineering, after which he was appointed a member of the communications section of the Naval Scientific and Technical Committee, while he also managed to read radio engineering disciplines at the Naval Engineering School, the Naval Academy, the Leningrad Electrotechnical Institute.  He organized the Naval Institute of Communications, where he continued to work on the development of radio communications equipment in the fleet of Blocka-1, Blocka-2. <br><br>  <b>‚ÄúBlock 1‚Äù, ‚ÄúBlock 2‚Äù</b> <br><br>  In 1931, a scientifically founded, fairly complete, unified radio-equipment system of the Blockade-1 fleet was created.  A significant contribution to its development was made by naval sailors and scientists Berg and Siforov.  The basic principles of the construction of integrated radio communications systems for the Navy were formulated.  In 1934, the Blockade-1 complex was developed; it consisted of the Reid radio transceiver station, the Bukhta and Breeze transmitters (7 types of long-wave and 2 types of short-wave radio transmitters), the Dozor and KUB receivers -four". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d95/b0c/1ad/d95b0c1adedb46fb8f64c01ce56f2f13.jpg"><br>  <i>radio receiver KV-KUB-4M</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d53/54a/3e4/d5354a3e45ba4b11928687499e1df47f.jpg"><br>  <i>45-PK-1 HF radio receiver</i> <br><br>  Radio "Reid" was for intra-squadron communication and communication with the amphibious parties.  For sending orders from the base to the boat, the main one was a long-wave link, the backup one was short-wave.  The boats communicated with the base on short waves, in the event of the failure of the HF transmitter, communication occurred on long ones.  On the large and medium submarines were installed HF / DV-transmitter "Shkval-Shch" and VHF radio "Reid".  It can be said that such a complex has become a symbol of the transition from the old spark radio technology to lamp transmitters and receivers that could provide more reliable radio communication.  Later, for the development of the North and the Far East, it was necessary to improve the complex, the Blockade-2 complex was created. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/83f/b92/125/83fb92125d1e49fe9df9763d030f64a5.jpg"><br>  <i>HF radio transmitter "Bay"</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d50/966/318/d50966318bad407c841d2b64feee03a0.jpg"><br>  <i>HF radio "Snowstorm"</i> <br><br>  The radio blockade "Blockade-2" consisted of three radio receivers: instead of the receivers "Dozor" and KUB-4M, the superheterodyne "Thunder-M" (200-2500 meters), "Whirlwind" (200-10000 meters), "Purga "(15-220 meters).  The transmitters of medium and large boats were replaced by the "Perch" DV-band, "Breeze-MK", "Pike" and "Skat".  HF-range were installed on small, medium and large submarines, universal transmitter KV / DV-range "Shkval-M" - for large and medium submarines.  All ships were equipped with a Reid radio receiver, which worked in radiotelephony mode in the range of 4‚Äì5 meters, with a 5 W transmitter with a communication range of 4‚Äì15 miles, depending on the antenna height. <br><br>  <b>Little personal</b> <br><br>  ... In 1928, Axel Ivanovich divorced Nora Rudolfnovna and married Marianna Penzina for the second time.  Marianna lived in the city of Tuapse in the house left by her dead father, worked as a typist in the port in order to earn some more penny she rented out rooms to visiting sailors.  Axel Ivanovich also became a sailor in 1923, during the journey of Professor Freiman and three students at the Naval Academy to the Black Sea, where they conducted experiments with underwater radio communications.  Acquainted with the girl, showed her the boat and went with her comrades to drink tea to her.  A friendship ensued, in 1924, Berg and his wife came to Marianna, stayed with her for a couple of weeks, after which they corresponded for a couple more years.  In 1927, she was invited to her home in Leningrad, she sold her house and moved to them. Then she graduated from high school and entered the first year of LETI ... And now - divorce and remarriage, but in Marianne. <br><br>  But Berg Axel Ivanovich was married three times, his third wife was called Raisa Pavlovna. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c04/da1/02e/c04da102ec3d45b99cb253b913baee7a.png"><br><br>  In 1935 he became a professor at the Naval Academy in Petrograd, engaged in teaching at the Leningrad Electrotechnical Institute (LETI).  Axel Ivanovich was the ideologist of all higher education in communications and observation in the navy, he checked all theoretical calculations experimentally, the calculation method had to be exact, but affordable and simple.  Under his leadership, the properties of ultrashort waves and the possibility of their use in communication and navigation techniques were investigated. <br><blockquote>  Teaching activities captured Axel Ivanovich.  He was an excellent lecturer, clearly and consistently expounded the material, and his hand in a white kid's glove neatly wrote complex formulas on the board. <br></blockquote><br><h3>  Years of repression </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/646/76d/2ad/64676d2ad3a549e4acaa8e99a1badf66.png"><br><br><blockquote>  A broken cup can be glued together.  But she will not ring anymore. </blockquote><br>  Everything seemed to be just beginning, career growth, dedication, many plans ... but 1937 came.  A wave of repression swept across the country.  Axel Ivanovich is a man of noble origin, with a non-Russian surname, a track record (service in the royal navy), trips abroad, all of which did not benefit the scientist.  He was arrested on December 21, 1937.  Axel Ivanovich was accused of sabotage ... "Berg A.I.'s harmful work was reduced to the fact that he expanded the work of the NIMIS departments to create the maximum possible number of communication samples and special equipment, creating the impression of intensive work of the institute, but not bringing the samples to complete completeness and final tests for the possibility of their transfer to the fleet‚Äôs arsenal ", a commission was created which somehow counted 154 million rubles in damage brought to the state by Berg and his subordinates when creating new  Oh communication technology and special equipment.  Axel Ivanovich denied guilt in this group case.  Axel Ivanovich, being a courageous man, was not afraid to show protest against the composition of the commission.  A new commission headed by the head of NIMIST Ya. G. Varaksin (who included Prof. M. A. Krupsky and M. S. Beschastnov) announced that the charges against Berg have no basis.  Axel Ivanovich in his defense and the defense of his players referring from memory!  on the relevant documents refuted all the allegations.  The charges were dropped!  In May 1940, Berg was rehabilitated, he was reinstated in a military rank and was given the military rank of engineer-rear admiral.  Axel Ivanovich returned to teaching. <br><br>  In total, Axel Ivanovich spent 1,000 days in prison.  Berg got to Shpalernaya, later he was transferred to Moscow to Lubyanka and then transferred to Butyrka prison.  Surprisingly, even while being in captivity, he used to spend every day, he had the opportunity to meet with very talented people, such as K. K. Rokossovsky (future marshal), A. N. Tupolev (famous designer of airplanes), P. And Lukirsky (future academician).  Alas, but in those days great minds more often sat in chambers than truly villains.  They did not waste time, organized scientific seminars, each lecturing from his field of knowledge.  Berg, knowing not only Russian, but also German, French and English, for long evenings could read to his cellmates poems and verses in memory in these languages. <br><br>  I do not cease to admire his courage and sense of humor, according to Neumann: during the interrogations Axel Ivanovich was beaten hard ... Berg "broke down".  He asked for a piece of paper, began writing a confession in which he pleaded guilty to having carried out espionage activities for the benefit of the Navy of the Swiss Confederation for a number of years.  The investigator immediately finished the interrogation, stamped the end of the interrogation, ran over the authorities.  I did not realize that Switzerland has no navy ... <br><br>  From the memoirs of V. I. Siforov: <br><br>  "... there was talk that" Axel Ivanovich serves in foreign intelligence services, that his books on radio engineering are wrecking. "Then, in 1938, A.I. Berg was arrested, declaring the enemy of the people" A.I. Berg's wife Mariana Ivanovna [3] left without livelihoods: she lived on Pesochnaya Street in a house that belonged to LETI. Many teachers and professors met her on the other side of the street to protect themselves. During this period even short-term contacts with relatives and friends of enemies of the people could lead to arrest  However, my wife and I did not avoid contact with Mariana Ivanovna, and, deeply respecting A.I. Berg, we invited her to our home and regularly supplied her with money. Of course, at that time it was very dangerous. But somehow the feeling of help to the relatives of Axel Ivanovich prevailed. " <br><br>  Little is known about what happened in prisons with Axel Ivanovich, as he signed a non-disclosure agreement.  From his memoirs: usually one of the sailors sat in the neighboring cells, he made contact with them using Morse code.  "... and in every way he tried to keep his peers in misfortune back. 35 years after these events, when Berg was the chairman of the Council, a letter from Siberia arrived at his official address from Siberia. We, the Council staff, were amazed how excited this letter was Berg. He wrote an old, very sick man who turned out to be Berg‚Äôs ‚Äúcolleague‚Äù in one of the prisons. Or rather, he dictated his daughter‚Äôs letter because he was blind. He learned about Axel Ivanovich from the press. The letter contained memories of the days when Berg was the headman  of the jail chamber, and I expressed my heartfelt gratitude to Berg for his optimism, goodwill, and willingness to help. <br><br><h3>  From counterrevolutionary immediately got to the rear admirals </h3><br>  World War II began and Axel Ivanovich was attracted to activities related to strengthening the country's defense.  In 1941, Berg was awarded the title of counter-dying engineer by a decree of the Council of People's Commissars.  In these war years, Berg, undoubtedly, made a tremendous contribution to the development of radio engineering and electronic armament of the USSR Army. <br><br>  He was not afraid to negotiate with Stalin on the creation of radar facilities, and achieved a positive decision.  In the USSR at that time, not everyone had an idea what radar was and what its function was, whether it was important for defense.  Berg came to Moscow with his vigor to explain the principles of radar operation and their effectiveness, met with ministers, led a wide propaganda.  I got to Stalin himself. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe Central Committee of the CPSU (b) found it necessary to draw attention to this case.  And then I reported that you need to create a radar council with the appropriate powers ... Stalin had a meeting at which I was and reported that it was necessary for each people's commissariat to build their own radar stations, but according to the unified armament system that we developed.  Many objected, but they did not know that I had reported all this to Stalin one on one within three hours.  Stalin went, smoked his pipe, cursed that he did not understand anything - which I did not explain to him that way.  He walked around, puffing on his pipe, and then said: "And in my opinion, Comrade Berg is right."  And Berg was the son of his time.  Even completely, having taken the grief of the Stalinist repressions, until the end of his days he had great respect for the personality of Stalin.  ‚ÄúYes, there was a cult, but there was also a personality!‚Äù Said Berg. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f10/30b/074/f1030b074c804c8c99a5f736110dc1ce.jpg"><br><br>  It was decided to establish a location committee, where A.I. Berg was appointed deputy chairman.  On July 4, 1943, a resolution was issued on the establishment of the Radiolocation Council, the tasks assigned to it were as follows: prepare draft military technical assignments for the T-bills for designers on armaments of the Red Army and Navy with radiolocation means, fully develop the radar industry, and involve radar in the case. the largest scientific, design and engineering forces, to systematize all the achievements of science and technology in the field of radar, both in the USSR and abroad, to prepare pre  proposals for the State Defense Committee (State Defense Committee) on the import of radar equipment. <br><br>  In the early 50s, Axel Ivanovich headed the Central Research Institute 108, which developed the radar equipment.  The radar council was a kind of organization: ‚Äúthere was not a single research institution or production enterprise at its disposal ‚Äî they were all under the jurisdiction of the defense commissariats;  even VNII-108, the closest to the Radiolocation Council, and that administratively subordinate to the 8th Office of the NEPC.  However, all the recommendations and instructions of the Radiolocation Council were carried out unconditionally: behind him stood the authority of the State Defense Committee and the laws of wartime. ‚Äù <br><br>  In 1953 he was appointed deputy defense minister of the USSR for radio equipment.
