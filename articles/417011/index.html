  <section class="page js-page"><h1>TOP 10 new blockchain projects in 2018 - Forbes</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Almost all the reviews that came to my eyes were written to provide information about top cryptocurrency and blockchain companies that are worth paying attention to, and, practically, they all mentioned Bitcoin and Aether.  The only problem is that these companies are not new and most people who are interested in this topic know or heard about them.  Thus, the reviews did not provide any new information.  However, there are a huge number of companies worthy of attention, and in addition to Bitcoin and Ether.  Therefore, in my article I want to explore this topic deeper and create an updated list of companies. <br><br>  According to experts, the global blockchain market will reach more than $ 60 billion in 2024, as more and more companies are beginning to use distributed registry technology and the use of this technology is becoming widespread.  Despite being still in the early stages of development, the blockchain technology is being carefully studied and adopted by world-famous industry titans like IBM and Softbank. <br><br>  In addition, thousands of innovative companies around the world are trying to solve the problems of market imperfections through the effective use of the opportunities offered by blockchain technology.  Such companies are found in almost all industries, from content creation and transportation services to financial institutions.

Celsius Network's goal is to attract the next 100 million people to use cryptocurrency, becoming the first <a href="https://celsiusnetwork.app.link/forbes">killer app</a> in the world.  Risky or not, it clearly deserves close attention.  The purpose of this financial and technological startup is to replace the traditional banking system. <br><br><h3>  <a href="https://www.menlo.one/">Menlo one</a> </h3><br>  Menlo One is a platform for creating decentralized applications that run at the speed of regular web applications.

CIINCH and ADBIT were created to help automate many layers of manual processes that have become the scourge of this industry.  Traditional media could not use innovations and adapt to the current state of affairs in our century.  Highly fragmented and running on licensed software developed in the 1990s, ADBIT and CIINCH are designed to move all these processes into the present. <br><br><h3>  <a href="http://dacc.co/">Dacc</a> </h3><br>  DACC is the world's first content-based blockchain that demonstrates identity and access control (IAM) at the infrastructure level.

This allows you to ensure the reliable preservation of cryptocurrency keys and the storage of important digital means. <br><br><h3>  <a href="https://www.fcoin.com/">Fcoin</a> </h3><br>  Founded by Tzang Gian, the former head of FCoin, is a fully decentralized and transparent cryptocurrency exchange based in China.

But not only technological startups introduce technical innovations.  Such companies as Softbank and IBM, VIP-brands such as SAP, BP, Samsung and titanium in the field of transportation Maersk also use decentralized sales accounting systems and new blockchain technologies. <br><br>  At the moment, these 10 companies deserve attention, but only time will tell which of them will succeed in the end.
