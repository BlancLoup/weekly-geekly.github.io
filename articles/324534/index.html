We get on a landing page or site, we see an excellent offer of a product or service.  And then we start asking ourselves questions: <br>  You have very cheap, why?  Not a fake?  And what are the guarantees?  Will not break after 1 month?  I do not believe that it can be so!  And we try to find these answers in texts on landings, but we do not often find them.

This is the natural state of one who prepares to pay money for something. <br>  Objections arise in his head to convince himself of the failure of your proposal.  The user wants to find a weak spot, for which he can cling and proudly say to himself: ‚ÄúSo I found this, now you will not deceive me and I will not buy from you!‚Äù <br><br><h2>  <font color="#5b6166">What options of objections do clients have?</font>  <font color="#5b6166">Consider a few typical:</font> </h2><br>  1.

    <ul><li>  You have a very expensive. </li><li>  You are very cheap. </li><li>  I don't have that kind of money. </li><li>  And others are cheaper ... </li></ul><br>  2. Trust.  Among the arguments of doubt: <br><br><ul><li>  And you will not take the money and not run away? </li><li>  Are you responsible for the quality? </li><li>  Does it really work? </li><li>  I need to think and make sure ... </li><li>  And what are the guarantees? </li><li>  Are you really experts in this? </li><li>  I want to buy, but not now.  We must look for an alternative ... </li><li>  Well, I'm not very interested, probably / for now ... </li><li>  I need this to work like this, not that way ... </li><li>  Will the result of the purchase? </li></ul><br>  3. The problem of choice.  Among doubts: <br><br><ul><li>  It is not clear how to choose from analogs. </li><li>  It is not clear what exactly suits me. </li><li>  And whether it is suitable for me or is it worth it to still search, pick out? </li></ul><br>  4. Timing.  Among temporary objections: <br><br><ul><li>  I needed it yesterday, and you only have it tomorrow. </li><li>  And if you have time for a week? </li><li>  And in an hour you will not be able to deliver? </li><li>  And why do you take / deliver for so long? </li></ul><br>  5. Difficulty.  Among the arguments of misunderstanding: <br><br><ul><li>  How do you work? </li><li>  Can I get a result after your seminar? </li><li>  Will I be able to deal with your proposal myself or will I have to study? </li><li>  I am a kettle and do not understand anything about it ... </li><li>  This is too hard for me‚Ä¶ </li></ul><br>  Important: the more objections you close on the site, the higher the conversion and sales will be.  Minimum open objection - maximum sales.  Envisage all unreal.  How many people - so many special arguments. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#5b6166">How to close objections and convince customers to buy goods</font> </h2><br>  In order to close the objections, we need for everyone to find counterarguments, facts, comparisons.  They must be weighty, truthful and logical. <br><br>  Our task is to explain to representatives of Central Asia that their beliefs are erroneous, to answer the question of why visitors should buy from us, work with us.  We have to demonstrate that by becoming our client, each user will receive the maximum benefit. <br><br>  Let me remind you: the <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/spagece/blog/322752/">goal of the second part of the Landing Page</a> is to confirm the benefits and close the objections of potential customers to increase conversion. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#5b6166">How the benefits are confirmed and the objections are closed</font> </h2><br>  Options may be different.  Used by: <br><br><ol><li>  text - literate, structured, easy for visual perception and reading; </li><li>  pictures on the topic (infographics, product photo, photo of satisfied customers, logos of partner companies or customers) - to demonstrate how your USP solves the client‚Äôs problem); </li><li>  video materials (videos about the company, about the team, video reviews, portfolio); </li><li>  audio files (for example, audio feedback - recording a conversation when a customer has already taken place, feedback after he took advantage of the offer). </li></ol><br><h2>  <font color="#5b6166">Product Information block</font> </h2><br><ol><li>  Working ahead of objections, we clearly and concisely describe the product. </li><li>  It is important to specify certain technical characteristics that are understandable to the client, even if they are far from the topic - power, materials, functions, experience of employees, etc. </li><li>  Product statistics is one of the most powerful counterarguments capable of closing objections of various levels and types: over 50,000 ... sold, 10,000 bought, 5,000 posted ... and so on </li><li>  Documents / Certificates - their scans (several in a row) and / or links to pages where all documents confirming your solvency and reliability are posted.  This may be awards, gratitude, victories in competitions and other materials. </li><li>  Photo / video. </li></ol><br><h4>  <font color="#5b6166">Examples:</font> </h4><br>  <b>Benefits</b> <br>  - Shoot video in 1080 HD with a shooting speed of 120 frames per second with a new camera. <br>  - The blender is made from quality materials and grinds glass balls into crumb for 1 minute. <br>  - The mobile phone has a 4000 mA battery and works without recharging for 3 days. <br><br>  <b>Price.</b> <br>  - Why so expensive?  - 3 specialists will work on your project (product specifications). <br>  - You have expensive!  - You will pay back investments depending on the intensity of use for 10-30 days (product). <br><br>  <b>The trust</b> <br>  - And you will definitely make a high quality?  - Examples of work performed, portfolio. <br>  - And what will happen if I do not like the product?  - We will refund money. <br>  - A horizontal bar will not break?  - Made of high-grade new steel. <br>  - Is this product safe for health?  ‚ÄúThese are safety certificates.‚Äù <br>  ‚ÄúDid the blender make a milkshake in 30 seconds?‚Äù  - Yes, its power is 1000 watts. <br>  - Do you have a reliable product?  - Sold over 5000 copies.  Zero reclamations. <br><br>  <b>Complexity</b> <br>  - Will I be able to get the same result as other students after passing your seminar?  - Our specialist conducted more than 30 trainings with 100% efficiency. <br>  - I will get the result?  - Yes, already 3,000 students have completed the course and created a Landing Page with a conversion of more than 10%. <br><br>  <b>Timing</b> <br>  - How long do do?  - The master will make a measurement in 15 minutes. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#5b6166">Block "Information about the Supplier / Company / Service"</font> </h2><br><ol><li>  In this block, everything should be very clear and obvious. </li><li>  Ltd. or other form of ownership, TIN and other company information. </li><li>  Office / office / store cards.  Information on the availability of the network by city / country / world. </li><li>  Statistics.  Accurate and truthful numbers, no overstatements, no words "from above" or "more."  Examples: </li><li>  Security icons - when paying with cards.  For example, the certificate of WM and others when paying with Internet wallets, encryption when paying with cards, etc. </li><li>  Personal appeal of the owner.  (If you do not get the result, we will refund your money). </li><li>  These photos of the team, office, production, warehouse or video materials. </li></ol><br><h4>  <font color="#5b6166">Examples:</font> </h4><br>  <b>Benefits</b> <br>  - In 3 sessions you will get rid of back pain by enrolling in a vertebrologist with 5 years of experience <br><br>  <b>Price</b> <br>  - Why so expensive?  - Our supplier from Germany.  That is why we have excellent quality. <br>  - Why so expensive?  - 5 professionals will work on your project. <br><br>  <b>The trust</b> <br>  - Can I trust you?  - We are on the market for 5 years.  Company registration documents. <br>  - Can I trust you?  - Here is a photo / video of the team / office. <br>  - Do you officially work?  - Here are our registration documents. <br><br>  <b>Complexity</b> <br>  - Can we use your product?  - Yes, we conduct training / Yes, management is simple, training is not required. <br><br>  <b>Timing</b> <br>  - When will I receive my order?  - Courier delivers the goods in 90 minutes. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#5b6166">Clients block</font> </h2><br>  This block works great for closing objections and confirming benefits.  How to create it?  First, set a goal, that is, determine what benefits you want to confirm, and close the objection.  Then solve this problem with the help of specially collected reviews.  The formula for collecting feedback will be lower. <br><br>  What may contain a block about customers: <br><br>  1. People (consumers or connoisseurs) familiar with the product: <br><ul><li>  ordinary (association with yourself, but confidence is not too high); </li><li>  stars, famous people; </li><li>  experts, critics; </li><li>  company owners. </li></ul><br>  2. Partners / Clients: <br><ul><li>  who do you work with? </li><li>  who buys from you? </li><li>  large status companies (if any, this is the most significant counter argument). </li></ul><br>  3. Statistics related to clientele and partners: <br><ul><li>  served 5,000 customers; </li><li>  working with us for 3 years; </li><li>  99% satisfied customers. </li></ul><br>  4. Social trust and confirmation: <br><ul><li>  groups in social networks from 3,000 people; </li><li>  Like, cher, repost, retweet from 100 pieces; </li><li>  YouTube channels from 1,000 people; </li><li>  feeds of social networks. </li></ul><br><h4>  <font color="#5b6166">Examples:</font> </h4><br>  <b>Benefits</b> <br>  - Confirm customer feedback. <br><br>  <b>Price</b> <br>  - Why so expensive?  - The price is fully consistent with the quality ... (Confirm customer feedback). <br><br>  <b>The trust</b> <br>  - Can I trust you?  - All made super ... (Confirm customer feedback) <br>  - Do you have good quality?  - The material is excellent, repairs done quickly and efficiently ... (Confirm customer feedback) <br>  - Are you experts?  - The masters of their craft arrived ... (Confirm with a client recall) <br><br>  <b>Complexity</b> <br>  - I definitely get the result?  - I was able to do this thanks to the training.  The program really works ... (Confirm customer feedback) <br>  ‚ÄúWill I definitely increase sales?‚Äù  - Sales increased by 45% and ... (Confirm customer feedback) <br><br>  <b>Timing</b> <br>  - Will I get the product on time?  - Do not disappoint.  Brought the next day, as promised ... (Confirm customer feedback) <br>  I strongly advise not to write reviews from myself.  This can be done only as a last resort, if you have a startup and no real feedback yet.  Even at the start do not write yourself.  Contact a specialist.  He knows how: <br><br><ul><li>  Stylize feedback for specific social, age, gender groups of your clients; </li><li>  Do not overdo it with a positive, emotions, slang. </li></ul><br>  Otherwise, the audience will see you at a time!  You yourself in 99% can distinguish this review from a fake.  Try reading them on different sites.  As soon as you have real clients and their response, immediately change the reviews to real ones. <br><br>  An example of a block with customer logos. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3ba/7ba/357/3ba7ba357309444ca7c8739eece0865f.jpg"><br><br>  An example of a block with customer reviews. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/76b/42e/83e/76b42e83e5a64d02bd82bdc42b18738f.jpg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#5b6166">How to get feedback</font> </h2><br>  Voluntary writing of the present, positive feedback is an extremely rare phenomenon.  Such is the psychology of man.  If he is satisfied, he simply uses your product.  If he is confronted with even small negatives, he wants to throw out his emotions on others. <br><br>  Positive feedback written by established customers is a must.  Get them. <br><br><ul><li>  First, you will be able to close the objections of potential buyers. </li><li>  Secondly, you will understand your target body better. </li></ul><br>  It will become clear to you exactly what you liked, what you were even partially dissatisfied with, what they still need to be completely happy and why they stay with you or decide to buy from others.  Your managers will be able to sell the product more efficiently if they know their target audience. <br>  So how do you collect real feedback?  Unobtrusively and subtly hint that you will be very grateful if there is a response to your product.  Pre-think what you need to confirm for the following clients, what objections to remove, because you need not just responses, but a variety of reviews. <br><br><ul><li>  Need to show benefits?  So ask, in what the client saw benefit, having bought your product? </li><li>  Want to show quality?  Ask this question: Has the customer been satisfied with the quality of the product? </li><li>  Do you want to know why exactly your order was made?  So ask: you chose from many, but stopped at our product, why? </li></ul><br>  Based on the task, formulate the necessary questions and send the writing of the response in the direction you need.  I suggest a template for collecting feedback.  This is only the basis, and therefore you will need to adjust the questions accordingly niche.  So! <br><br><ol><li>  Tell about yourself (name, age, what you do, etc.). </li><li>  How did you find out about our product? </li><li>  Why did you have a desire to buy? </li><li>  Were there any hesitations? </li><li>  What factor was decisive for you when buying? </li><li>  What results did you get from using the product? </li><li>  What would you say to those who still doubt? </li><li>  etc. </li></ol><br>  <b>PS</b> Team <a href="https://bloxy.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dblog%26utm_campaign%3Dpost8%26utm_content%3Dpslink">Bloxy</a> - creating a <a href="https://bloxy.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dblog%26utm_campaign%3Dpost8%26utm_content%3Dpslink">landing page</a> is easier than frying eggs. <br><br>  This is the first part on closing objections, in the next article we will tell about the remaining blocks. <br><br>  What methods of closing customer objections do you use? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/324534/">https://habr.com/ru/post/324534/</a></p>
