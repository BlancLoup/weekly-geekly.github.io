Overnight, he lost all hope of a comfortable life in the United States and was not only in the hands of New York law enforcement, but became the hero of the Associated Press <a href="http://www.bostonherald.com/news/local_coverage/2016/12/man_admits_stealing_from_atms_in_new_york_and_massachusetts">news</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/260/94c/5ce/26094c5ce3e8445fbe70b2bdd139996a.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The man managed to steal 127,000 US dollars using skimming devices installed in ATMs in New York and Massachusetts.  He later admitted that he and his colleague had used skimming devices and cameras to collect information about customer accounts. <br><br>  <i>Skimming refers to the reading of information from cards for fraudulent purposes using special devices.</i>

      According to a study conducted by <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/04/a-dramatic-rise-in-atm-skimming-attacks/">KrebsonSecurity</a> , in 2015 and 2016, the number of skimming attacks in American and European ATMs has grown rapidly.  Those who are not installed in bank branches, for example, in shopping centers or on busy streets, are most at risk.  In Europe, skimming attacks were directed on average to every twentieth ATM. <br><br>  Given the global prevalence of ATMs, skimming remains one of the most important concerns of bank security personnel.  It doesn‚Äôt matter whether a developed country or a developing country, you can become a victim of skimming anywhere, and banks are forced to invent new and new technologies to prevent such incidents.  Effective communication here is a must. <br><br>  According to Retail Banking Research, by 2020 there will be about 4 million ATMs around the world.  For comparison, in 2009 there were just over two million.  It is significant that the number of ATMs is growing, despite the rapid spread of non-cash payments, which means that information about the imminent death of ‚Äúcash‚Äù is somewhat exaggerated. <br><br>  There are many ways to fool a person trying to withdraw money.  They can attach a camera to an ATM, and it will remove how you enter the PIN code, and the skimmer copies the data from the magnetic strip so that the card data and its PIN code are available. <br><br>  When skimming cases are detected, it is critically important for the bank not only to instantly identify the affected ATMs, but also to <i>instantly</i> notify all customers who may have been the victim of fraud. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/586/2aa/4f3/5862aa4f3a9f498f86d0b1e68fcbd0ce.jpg"><br>  <i>The main thing that they were not too much ...</i> <br><br>  Usually, the bank promptly blocks all cards that were used in the compromised ATM, issuing a replacement. <br><br>  In this situation, it is simply necessary to inform customers about the measures taken by the bank in order to protect their funds.  And how a media campaign is organized depends a lot.  We in <a href="https://www.infobip.com/ru">Infobip</a> have an appropriate platform for such situations. <br><br>  Considering that modern consumers almost never part with their mobile devices, it is logical to focus communication campaigns on them, especially when it comes to really important messages.  On average, a smartphone user ‚Äúcommunicates‚Äù with his device about 200 times a day, which means that there is a greater chance that he will see an important message. <br><br>  In the ideal case, the bank will send messages through precisely those channels that, as he knows, the client uses exactly.  This can be SMS, phone call, email or notification via mobile app.  The client should know not only that he is at risk, but also what measures the bank has already taken to protect him. <br><br>  Speed ‚Äã‚Äãand proactivity in dealing with the consequences of fraud are necessary factors for the actions of any financial institution that cares about its reputation.  That is why modern communication solutions are used.  Such campaigns are a combination of real-time analytics and the rapid adoption of necessary decisions.  Otherwise the risks increase. <br><br>  Accordingly, the communication campaign manager should have access to various analytical modules that allow real-time assessment of the situation, as well as customized automatic campaign progress reports. <br><br>  The launch of a multichannel campaign with a single platform that unites all communication channels will allow you to save valuable time, and at the same time act in accordance with the available information about the behavioral patterns of each client. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/327374/">https://habr.com/ru/post/327374/</a></p>
