This system consists, roughly speaking, of a combination of the Monte Carlo method and neural networks of policy (policy networks) and value networks.  In order to reach the current level of skill, AlphaGo has played th hundreds of thousands of times (we are talking about about 160 thousand games already played).  The parties themselves were taken from the KGS server, where they play masters from the sixth to the ninth dan.  The system self-taught, and in many respects thanks to the original training system with reinforcement.  The first network of politics played with people, the second - played with the first, optimizing it.  This was done to ensure that the system sought to win, and not just predict the moves.  And such a system is quite justified.

      The fact is that go is a game with a huge number of possible positions of stones on a standard board.  Such positions are approximately in googol ( <sup>10,100</sup> ) times more than in chess.  This is even greater than the number of atoms in the entire Universe.  That is why it was considered a game, to train which artificial intelligence is very difficult, if at all possible.  But, as we see, it is quite possible.  And at first glance, everything is very simple = on the board of 19 * 19 lines, players place stones of two colors, and begin to try to occupy an area larger than their opponent‚Äôs stones.  I must say that before AlphaGo there were other programs - but they played at the level of an amateur, and not a master, moreover, 9th dan.  But AlphaGo managed to win the European champion, as well as one of the five strongest players in the world, Lee Sedol. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I must say that Sedol is a really strong player, who received his first professional dan in 1996, when he was only 13 years old.  He already owns 18 different titles of international importance.  Naturally, seeing the first attempts of AlphaGo to play with people, Sedol decided that the system was playing rather poorly.  And he rather quickly agreed to participate in a series of games with AlphaGo.  Initially, Sedol claimed that he would easily win a computer system with a score of 4: 1 or even 5: 0.  But the situation went out of his control, the computer started to win.  In <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/272782/">all five games, the</a> winner was the AlphaGo system.  If Lee Sedol won AlphaGo, he would have received millions of US dollars.  But he lost, and a million prize fund went to charity.  The prize fund to the loser was 170 thousand dollars.  Of these, 150 thousand - for participation, and 20 thousand - for the victory. <br><br>  <b>Game 1</b> <br><br>  Black: Lee Sedol <br>  White: AlphaGo <br>  Result: Lee Sedol admitted defeat <br>  Strokes: 186 <br><br>  <b>Game 2</b> <br><br>  Black: AlphaGo <br>  White: Lee Sedol <br>  Result: Lee Sedol admitted defeat <br>  Strokes: 211 <br><br>  <b>Game 3</b> <br><br>  Black: Lee Sedol <br>  White: AlphaGo <br>  Result: Lee Sedol admitted defeat <br>  Strokes: 176 <br><br>  <b>Game 4</b> <br><br>  Black: AlphaGo <br>  White: Lee Sedol <br>  Result: AlphaGo admitted defeat <br>  Moves: 180 <br><br>  <b>Game 5</b> <br><br>  Black: Lee Sedol <br>  White: AlphaGo <br>  Result: Lee Sedol admitted defeat <br>  Moves: 280 <br><br>  <b>Now what?</b> <br><br>  Thus, Lee Sedol won only once.  After a series of victories, AlphaGO received an honorary ninth professional dan from the Korean Padook Association.  And now a top level computer player can play with the Chinese champion, ninth dan master Ke Jie.  By the way, he defeated Lee Sedol several times.  Ke Jie is a genius in the world of go, and he claims that AlphaGo is about 60% likely to win.  Jie probably knows what he is saying.  Judge for yourself. <br><br>  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D1%258D_%25D0%25A6%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B5">He began learning to play go</a> at the age of 5, his teacher was Zhou Zongqiang (Âë®ÂÆóÂº∫).  In 2007 for the first time won the National Championship.  In 2008 he received the rank of 1 professional dan, and in 2015 - dan 9.  In January 2015, he won his first international world title in the second Bailing Cup, defeating Qiu Jun.  With this victory, Ke Jie became the youngest current world champion. <br><br>  In December 2015, defeated Shi Yue (Shi Yue) and won the 20th Samsung Cup.  Thus, he is the holder of two large international titles obtained in one year, for the first time since 2011, when a similar result was shown by Lee Sedol. <br><br>  The third international title Ke Jie won in January 2016 with a victory in the 2nd Meng Baihe Cup, taking over the famous South Korean player in th Lee Sedol.  Although the rivals point gap was minimal, and using a different scoring system, Lee would win.  This title makes him the fourth Chinese go professional to win three international titles, along with Gu Li, Kun Jie, Chang Hao.  In March 2016, he again met Lee at the 17th Nongshim Cup and also beat him 7-2. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a59/4a1/637/a594a1637a33bcaaa5f577d17a8a3cad.jpg"><br><br>  Jie <a href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/business/tech/2016-05/31/content_25553769.htm">is going to play</a> with AlphaGo in October of this year, in China, Hainan Province.  The relevant information appeared in the official Jie fan club in the Chinese equivalent of Twitter, Sina Weibo. <br><br>  Interestingly, immediately after the game with Sedol, AlphaGo scored 3533 points, which allowed the system to take fourth place in the global go player ranking.  Since then, the computer system has risen even higher, taking second place.  First place is now Ke Jie.  If the computer wins, the car will become the world champion.  If before the match with Sedol the specialists argued in terms of if the car had a chance to beat a person, now one can not argue.  The probability of winning a computer is quite high. <br><br>  <b>The current rating of masters from 1 to 25 place</b> <br><br><table><tbody><tr><th>  Rank </th><th>  Name </th><th>  ‚ôÇ‚ôÄ </th><th>  Flag </th><th>  Elo </th></tr><tr><td>  one </td><td>  Ke jie </td><td>  ‚ôÇ </td><td><img src="/flags/cn.svg" alt="cn"></td><td>  3625 </td></tr><tr><td>  2 </td><td>  Google DeepMind AlphaGo </td><td></td><td><img src="/flags/gb.svg" alt="gb"></td><td>  3605 </td></tr><tr><td>  3 </td><td>  Park junghwan </td><td>  ‚ôÇ </td><td><img src="/flags/kr.svg" alt="kr"></td><td>  3586 </td></tr><tr><td>  four </td><td>  Lee sedol </td><td>  ‚ôÇ </td><td><img src="/flags/kr.svg" alt="kr"></td><td>  3545 </td></tr><tr><td>  five </td><td>  Shi yue </td><td>  ‚ôÇ </td><td><img src="/flags/cn.svg" alt="cn"></td><td>  3529 </td></tr><tr><td>  6 </td><td>  Mi Yuting </td><td>  ‚ôÇ </td><td><img src="/flags/cn.svg" alt="cn"></td><td>  3526 </td></tr><tr><td>  7 </td><td>  Iyama yuta </td><td>  ‚ôÇ </td><td><img src="/flags/jp.svg" alt="jp"></td><td>  3523 </td></tr><tr><td>  eight </td><td>  Park yeonghun </td><td>  ‚ôÇ </td><td><img src="/flags/kr.svg" alt="kr"></td><td>  3507 </td></tr><tr><td>  9 </td><td>  Lian xiao </td><td>  ‚ôÇ </td><td><img src="/flags/cn.svg" alt="cn"></td><td>  3505 </td></tr><tr><td>  ten </td><td>  Tuo jiaxi </td><td>  ‚ôÇ </td><td><img src="/flags/cn.svg" alt="cn"></td><td>  3502 </td></tr><tr><td>  eleven </td><td>  Kim jiseok </td><td>  ‚ôÇ </td><td><img src="/flags/kr.svg" alt="kr"></td><td>  3502 </td></tr><tr><td>  12 </td><td>  Gu zihao </td><td>  ‚ôÇ </td><td><img src="/flags/cn.svg" alt="cn"></td><td>  3488 </td></tr><tr><td>  13 </td><td>  Chen yaoye </td><td>  ‚ôÇ </td><td><img src="/flags/cn.svg" alt="cn"></td><td>  3482 </td></tr><tr><td>  14 </td><td>  Zhou Ruiyang </td><td>  ‚ôÇ </td><td><img src="/flags/cn.svg" alt="cn"></td><td>  3477 </td></tr><tr><td>  15 </td><td>  Wang xi </td><td>  ‚ôÇ </td><td><img src="/flags/cn.svg" alt="cn"></td><td>  3468 </td></tr><tr><td>  sixteen </td><td>  Kang dongyun </td><td>  ‚ôÇ </td><td><img src="/flags/kr.svg" alt="kr"></td><td>  3467 </td></tr><tr><td>  17 </td><td>  Tang weixing </td><td>  ‚ôÇ </td><td><img src="/flags/cn.svg" alt="cn"></td><td>  3458 </td></tr><tr><td>  18 </td><td>  Li qincheng </td><td>  ‚ôÇ </td><td><img src="/flags/cn.svg" alt="cn"></td><td>  3457 </td></tr><tr><td>  nineteen </td><td>  Jiang weijie </td><td>  ‚ôÇ </td><td><img src="/flags/cn.svg" alt="cn"></td><td>  3455 </td></tr><tr><td>  20 </td><td>  Huang yunsong </td><td>  ‚ôÇ </td><td><img src="/flags/cn.svg" alt="cn"></td><td>  3454 </td></tr><tr><td>  21 </td><td>  Shin jinseo </td><td>  ‚ôÇ </td><td><img src="/flags/kr.svg" alt="kr"></td><td>  3448 </td></tr><tr><td>  22 </td><td>  Gu li </td><td>  ‚ôÇ </td><td><img src="/flags/cn.svg" alt="cn"></td><td>  3445 </td></tr><tr><td>  23 </td><td>  Peng liyao </td><td>  ‚ôÇ </td><td><img src="/flags/cn.svg" alt="cn"></td><td>  3444 </td></tr><tr><td>  24 </td><td>  Hong seongji </td><td>  ‚ôÇ </td><td><img src="/flags/kr.svg" alt="kr"></td><td>  3439 </td></tr><tr><td>  25 </td><td>  Lee donghoon </td><td>  ‚ôÇ </td><td><img src="/flags/kr.svg" alt="kr"></td><td>  3437 </td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/394747/">https://habr.com/ru/post/394747/</a></p>
