None of the competitors won a single point. <br><br>  If everything is so simple, why does the wh-100xm3 have no worthy competitors? </blockquote>  In fact, I have already said everything about ‚Äúthe best in the world of bluetooth codec‚Äù in previous articles, but dear <a href="https://habr.com/users/gordon01/" class="user_link">Gordon01</a> made me go to an old acquaintance for 900 km from home (Cyril, hello!) And close to consider the wireless headphones Sony <a href="https://habr.com/post/433724/">according to some</a> , the ultimate dream and the ultimate in wireless sound transmission technology.

    <h4>  What turned out to be? </h4><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Well, first general impression.  Yes, the headphones are quite rich, if earlier in the photo I was surprised by plastic compounds - everything is in order, the metal is where it should be, so it‚Äôs not easy to break them. <br><br>  Headphones, as I understand it, come in black or beige, I got these handsome men: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wl/n_/5h/wln_5hn9x8t05eccwwkjtzq3tw8.jpeg" width="450"></div><br>  And that's what immediately struck me: <br><br><h4>  1. Quality and performance of ear cushions </h4><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zj/7q/rr/zj7qrrn-qxl4_ksxdx6wzlrqfr8.jpeg" width="450"></div><br>  I‚Äôll say right away that I am particularly picky about this element, since it wears out pretty quickly.  The fact that the headphones <a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html%3F_from%3DR40%26_trksid%3Dm570.l1313%26_nkw%3DSony%2BWH-1000XM3%26_sacat%3D0">for almost $ 300,</a> intended for use outside the home, ear cushions are not removable - I am very upset.  Yes, eco-leather of good quality - but in any case it is a polymer that has the properties of aging from the sun, moisture and mechanical abrasion. <br><br>  Speaking of moisture, the ears in the headphones are really hot.  This is what happened after an hour of listening at 21 C: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/9p/_m/f2/9p_mf2xeqb5xsnpjlghuajab_wg.jpeg" width="450"></div><br>  Below I will write about the experience of using headphones while running, and so: this hour I just sat in the chair and flipped through the various tracks in the player. <br><br><h4>  2. Active noise cancellation system </h4><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tt/_z/ea/tt_zeai1bsnr8bek0wgtytmpnx0.jpeg" width="450"></div><br>  Here - without criticism.  She is gorgeous.  Sony was indeed able to analyze ambient noise and create an active antiphase.  Moreover: the system analyzes the shape of your head, determines how the ear cushions lie, adapts to the wearing glasses.  It is not surprising that travelers love the headphones very much - they allow you to enjoy music on the plane and on the train.  Some people write that you can just turn on the noise maker and sleep in silence - well, I don‚Äôt know, the headphones are really large, honestly, if 250 grams and the ‚Äútower‚Äù on your head do not bother anyone - how can the surrounding noise interfere? <br><br><h4>  3. Use as a headset </h4><br>  And here - everything is bad.  And I think that this is the result of noise: apparently, the engineer designed the microphone so as to accurately capture the surrounding noise, and not the user's speech.  This is expressed in the fact that the interlocutor heard not so much me as everything around, and constantly asked me to speak louder.  Yes, in a quiet room you can use headphones as a headset, but on the street be prepared to really scream. <br><br><h4>  4. Software </h4><br>  In fact, this software is not for headphones, but for a smartphone ( <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.sony.songpal.mdr">Android version is here</a> ).  I admit honestly: I didn‚Äôt have time to test the software, and I lost the music from the player, because I don‚Äôt like to litter the phone with media content.  The software is quite rich in settings, it allows you to adapt the operation of headphones depending on how you move (without moving, walking, running, transport), as well as changing the playback settings. <br>  Equalizer is also present, there is even this: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nr/nn/gt/nrnngtdplddclzsl1aj4sxprkjg.jpeg"></div><br>  I repeat: I did not test the software, it was not my task, but you can read the reviews on the Market. <br><br><h4>  5. Sound quality </h4><br>  I'll be brief: bad.  It doesn't matter if DSEE HX is turned off or with it, via Bluetooth or via a cord ‚Äî the headphones frankly ‚Äúsound‚Äù, and the sound detailing is reduced.  Yes, it is possible that this is good for some kind of dance music - but I didn‚Äôt like it.  I tried to play with the equalizer by lowering the bass, but I couldn‚Äôt get the parts back. <br><br>  Let's be frank: yes, at the moment audiophiles should wait - alas, wireless technologies - but they cannot transmit sound without distortion, but why is the same situation observed through the cord?  Can not answer. <br><br>  And finally - the promised IMHO or ... <br><br><h2>  The convenience of use </h2><br>  In my opinion, Sony WH-1000XM3 is a very niche, specific model for travelers who are tired of long trips or flights in conditions of noise.  Why?  Oh well! <br><br><h4>  1. Headphones cannot be used for a long time. </h4><br>  Ears are sweating.  The head gets tired - I repeat: 250 grams!  Coma, I can‚Äôt imagine why the ‚Äúrun‚Äù mode was added to the software - it‚Äôs unrealistic with such headphones, they just drive on their heads, trying to fly away. <br><br><h4>  2. Headphones are afraid of the environment. </h4><br>  Everything is simple: there is such a disgrace on top of the headphones: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/2r/wb/um/2rwbumah5mgalmahfioahdgavew.jpeg" width="450"></div><br>  It is easy enough to imagine what will happen to the electronics in case of rain. <br><br>  About dust protection, I generally keep quiet.  Here, everything is open, everything is available: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mn/ek/08/mnek08kkusksnj5vktdrm5tfrmi.jpeg" width="450"></div><br><h4>  3. Management uncomfortable in the field </h4><br>  Touch control, it is in the right earpiece.  From the center we hold up or down - change the volume, left or right - jump the composition.  Press - pause or play.  Putting the palm to the right earpiece, you muffle the music and turn on the external microphones, it is convenient when someone addresses you. <br><br>  Conveniently?  Yes.  Is it practical?  Not. <br><br>  First, as I already wrote - I tried to run in these headphones.  It didn‚Äôt lead to anything good - but I didn‚Äôt pay attention to the subject, that the touch panel is so sensitive that when running it manages to cut a pause and jump from composition to composition.  I could not turn it off. <br><br>  Secondly, having some experience with touch panels, I am very concerned about how these headphones function in the winter, in frost conditions. <br><br><h2>  Conclusion or my verdict </h2><br>  The Sony WH-1000XM3 is a rather interesting headphone model, in which Sony has obviously invested quite a lot: this is the QN1 processor (read about it, by the way, this is quite interesting), and the company's LDAC codec (it's also interesting here, but we already talked about it ), and quite spun DSEE HX. <br><br>  And it turned out also interesting: I really never met such high-quality active noise cancellation before. <br><br>  It turned out quite interesting and technological earplugs.  But alas - not headphones. <br><br>  Because the sound leaves much to be desired.  So at home I will use others. <br><br>  Because outdoor use Sony WH-1000XM3 is extremely problematic. <br><br>  Because in conditions of playing sports it is generally impossible to use. <br><br>  And then why this wireless technology? <br><br>  Of course, this product will be extremely interesting to everyone who, by the nature of their activities or on their own will, travel a lot and for a long time.  But to call the Sony WH-1000XM3 "the pinnacle of wireless sound transmission technology", "the best of its kind" - I would not. <br><br>  Very high quality - but very highly specialized product to its consumer. <br><br>  And of course with very expensive and well-promoted marketing. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/435798/">https://habr.com/ru/post/435798/</a></p>
