The first quarter was joined by 423 people, and reached the end and received 129 students from professional retraining from the Academic University.  Summing up, we asked the graduates a few questions, and we want to share their answers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8f7/82c/e9c/8f782ce9cfe846b09755fe4bd1a1659b.jpg">

    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  They shared their impressions: <br><br><ul><li>  Alexey Immoreev, a programmer at QIWI, </li><li>  Alexander Kataev, Java developer, </li><li>  Alexey Davydov, a geneticist, is studying the adaptive immunity in CEITEC, </li><li>  Svetlana Kulikova, Java developer. </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3f5/1d7/125/3f51d7125ed24305b1781980c9fa2047.jpg" align="left"><h5>  <b>About why they went to the program</b> </h5><br>  <i>Alexey I</i> .: I wanted to learn new programming languages, the game format provided a ‚Äúfan‚Äù process, and the diploma made sense. <br>  <i>Alexander K</i> .: I am a physicist by training, and I really do not have enough computer science base for professional growth.  All the declared courses of the program were very interesting to me. <br>  <i>Alexey D</i> .: In modern genetics, experiments related to the analysis of high-throughput sequencing data dominate.  About 10 years ago this technology was only in its infancy, and biologists were not taught at all to work with such data, but now it is simply necessary. <br>  <i>Svetlana K</i> .: Decided to change the scope of activities. <br><br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/af8/54f/949/af854f9496504b69a7b9fe41e87bb7e9.jpg" align="right"><h5>  <b>About the organization of their time in the learning process</b> </h5><br>  <i>Alexey</i> I.: I tried to take courses as early as their opening, as far as it went, since I was enrolled in other courses on Stepik.org, and it took time for everyone to pass.  The courses from the program took about 6-8 hours a week to solve problems and time to view lectures. <br>  <i>Alexander K</i> .: Some quarters were lighter, some heavier.  On average, I allocated two to three evenings on weekdays and a whole day off for lectures and assignments.  Most of the tasks were solved on this particular day off.  Only a week took about 15 hours. <br>  <i>Alexey D</i> .: I worked mainly in the evenings on weekdays, two or three hours, and on weekends it was five hours.  In a week it turned out about 20-30 hours. <br>  <i>Svetlana K</i> .: Almost all the free time was spent on classes.  If you could sleep at least six hours, then this is an unprecedented success.  From many of the usual entertainment had to be abandoned.  And to be honest, almost from everything.  All comments about ‚Äúthere is no time to sleep, eat, chat with family and friends‚Äù is true. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/18a/c7e/458/18ac7e45845e43d5b2dfef17b9e9e37c.jpg" align="left"><h5>  <b>About motivation</b> </h5><br>  <i>Alexey I</i> .: First of all, I motivated the gamification of the platform.  Making Achievements is an exciting activity.  And, of course, an important role was played by the understanding that this knowledge will be useful to me professionally. <br>  <i>Alexander K</i> .: In addition to the desire for personal and professional growth, the deadlines were very motivated. <br>  <i>Alexey D</i> .: Motivated by the opportunity to immediately apply the knowledge gained in the work, as well as the high quality of teaching in most courses. <br>  <i>Svetlana K</i> .: The final goal is a new job.  To get it, you need to complete the courses, but not just to finish, but to get maximum knowledge and skills from them.  And the constant deadlines, of course, did not allow to relax for a minute. <br><br><h5>  <b>Results</b> </h5><br>  <i>Alexey I</i> .: Diploma, many studied languages ‚Äã‚Äãand concepts.  Great result! <br>  <i>Alexander K</i> .: I began to feel more confident, broadened my horizons.  The program helped keep the brain in shape. <br>  <i>Alexey D</i> .: I received good basic knowledge, and now it is easier for me to independently master the methods and tools for solving specific problems. <br>  <i>Svetlana K</i> .: New profession, new job. <br><br><br><h5>  <b>Wishes to future students</b> </h5><br>  <i>Alexey I</i> .: Do not postpone the solution of tasks until the deadline. <br>  <i>Alexander K</i> .: It is very useful to try to apply this knowledge in practice, even if using toy examples.  Participate in discussions more - it is very useful both for you and for the community. <br>  <i>Alexey D</i> .: Adequately assess whether you have enough time.  And, if you have already taken it, I wish strength and motivation to reach the end. <br>  <i>Svetlana K</i> .: For future students of strength and patience. <br><br>  Learn more and join the second launch of the program on the website: <a href="http://code.stepik.org/">code.stepik.org</a> .  Start of training in mid-September 2016. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/309016/">https://habr.com/ru/post/309016/</a></p>
