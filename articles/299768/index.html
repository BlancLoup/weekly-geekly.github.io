But there are few who take into account the subsequent development after the takeover of the project by a large company - this happened with the founder of the start-up Dropcam Greg Duffy, who later sold his company to Google Nest in June 2014, but now considers this solution far from the most successful. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Greg Duffy <a href="http://uk.businessinsider.com/dropcam-founder-greg-duffy-responds-to-tony-fadell-says-it-was-mistake-to-sell-to-google-2016-3">made a statement</a> about the takeover by Nest after Tony Fadell, CEO of Nest, after commenting on the professional skills of Dropcam employees.

    <blockquote>  ‚ÄúMany of their Dropcam employees were not as good as we had hoped.  Unfortunately, they were not an experienced team, ‚ÄùTony Fadell said in an interview with The Information. </blockquote><br>  It was this statement that served as the answer from the founder of Dropcam, who also spoke about the profits of Nest in comparison with his project. <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúIf you knew the total percentage from Alphabet‚Äôs third-party income list of $ 448 million, which was published in the fourth fiscal quarter of last year, which brought a relatively small Dropcam team of 100 people, Nest would not look so successful,‚Äù Greg Duffy said . </blockquote><br>  According to the founder of Dropcam, only the worst qualities of mentors are grafted and praised inside Nest.  This opinion is shared not only by the head of Dropcam, but also by former employees of Nest - criticism of Tony Fadella has been repeatedly published on specialized sites, as well as in various publications. <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúBefore our takeover, Dropcam was in the middle of a record year in sales, our camera rating on Amazon was at 4.5 stars.  We planned to launch new innovative products, we still had most of the finances in the bank from the last round and our investors together with the team did not want to sell Nest.  That was my mistake, but this is a story for another story, ‚ÄùGreg Duffy recalls in a <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/dropcam-founder-greg-duffy-response-to-nest-ceo-tony-fadell-2016-3">publication</a> on Medium. </blockquote><br>  It is likely that after such a statement, the heads of Alphabet and Nest will make a response statement, but so far the official representatives of the companies have refrained from commenting. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299768/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299768/</a></p>
