      I am a representative of the Testing Laboratory, we have an office in Moscow, also in Belarus.  We carry out outsourcing projects.  Also very known as organizers of training and conferences.  For example: <br>  ‚Ä¢ SQA Days <br>  ‚Ä¢ SPM Days <br>  ‚Ä¢ Analyst Days <br>  These are leading conferences that take place in Russia, Belarus and Ukraine.  As a representative of an outsourcing company, we will talk about the service business for those who are on the contractor‚Äôs part. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  What is the purpose of the relationship with the customer? </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/96b/057/a7e/96b057a7e4403ec6f789621ac0a9e5aa.jpg"><br><br>  When you come to your doctor, he knows about your diseases.  So in our history, when a customer has been working with you for a long time - you can work with him quickly, easily, efficiently, you understand him perfectly, you know all his sores and you can easily advise him something.  About the outsourcing business, we will say that people come for development (software), but such part as maintenance is also highlighted.  Not just came or ordered, received and left, the quality of service is important to people!  Of course, such a component as the cost matters, but we will not dwell on it strongly. <br><br>  On the other hand (by the consumer), we can say that instead of developing, the goal of the business is profit, money received from the customer, and in terms of service, it is customer loyalty.  If we serve well, we get a loyal customer.  And our situation becomes similar to the CAFE business, where sometimes it‚Äôs not so much what you order as it matters how much you are served. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/736/5e1/38f/7365e138f633778e6202df4756c990dd.jpg"><br><br>  For example, when using the service station, you act as a customer or make an order in a cafe, try to pay attention to the fact that you are pleased, as a customer, maybe in some trifles that surprised you.  And here you can learn something for your customers.  If you are pleasantly surprised or touched by something, mark it and try to project it on your business, on the business of an outsourcing company, you may be able to apply something similar to your customer. <br><br><h6>  Selection criteria </h6><br>  One customer said that ‚Äúplans, schedules, reports are good, but the main thing is impression.‚Äù <br>  Outsourcing business is difficult to assess identically.  Evaluation is always conducted subjectively, and subjectivity is of great importance.  The client is important what he had the impression of the company.  If he likes the company - he is ready to work with her and will see what happens.  Sometimes it is impossible to make an unequivocal assessment, therefore, the subjective assessment and impressions of the customer are very important. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/96b/057/a7e/96b057a7e4403ec6f789621ac0a9e5aa.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e84/0dc/8e4/e840dc8e4c7d82f8b5535ca7443f9ca0.jpg"><br><br><h5>  Relationship structure </h5><br>  Consider the structure of relationships in the company and between the customer and the sponsor.  The sponsor is the one who gives the money, and the work itself is carried out by the project manager who reports to the sponsor.  There are people of the customer.  From the outsourcing side, for example, the Director of the company, there is a project manager who ‚Äúheels in the chest‚Äù for the success of the company and ensures interaction within the outsourcing company.  There are outstaff: programmers, designers and other employees.  Global interaction is possible when discussing an order with the owner‚Äôs participation, but as a rule, the entire dialogue is built on the level of project managers from one side and the other. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9f7/11d/b13/9f711db1332defc16906ac56223c7654.jpg"><br><br><h6>  Who is the customer? </h6><br>  A good question arises: ‚ÄúWhich of the people on the customer‚Äôs side is the customer directly?  Who will we impress? ‚ÄùThe company's CEO, owner of the company, or project manager ‚Äî who is the goal?  Who will we influence? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c8f/874/bd8/c8f874bd827288065a3d2388ba0cb0e5.jpg"><br><br>  I do not know who would choose who, but the outsourcing company would choose all customers, not for nothing for illustrations I chose such respected and famous people. <br><br>  In the previous slides you saw that the project manager communicates closely with the sponsor.  If we communicate with him, his thoughts about the outsourcing company are transmitted to the sponsor.  Difficult question: "Who and how will you really evaluate?".  Ideally, you need to have a good relationship with all representatives of the customer.  There are also some corporate moments.  There may be conflicts with a local project manager who will blame your failures, and this will have a negative impact on the outsourcing company and will also slow down the work.  In this case, you should try to go higher than him, go to the sponsor or other leadership and solve all the difficult moments.  As a customer you need to see any representative of the company, even outstaff. <br><br>  Even if you come across such people, it is better to have a good relationship with them.  The project manager, who is in close contact with each other, should be well handled so that he transmits his good impression of your outsourcing company and recommends it within his company.  Indeed, in some customer companies, parts of the project have been transferred to India, Ukraine, Belarus, and there is the possibility of revising the budget.  Accordingly: ‚ÄúAnd who is the service department for such clients?  This is the owner of the company, the project manager, who should do this? ". <br><br><h6>  Customer service </h6><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f31/833/d1e/f31833d1e8a04d8d736ec9f12a9d895a.jpg"><br><br>  I would say that customer service is all people who work with customer representatives.  This is an outstaff and programmers, if they contact the customer directly, if this is accepted in the company.  Not all companies have this practice, in some it is conditionally prohibited.  There are cases when there is contact with the client - this also creates an opinion about the company. <br>  What programmers we have is such an opinion.  We recommend that communication takes place with a more experienced person in dealing with customers.  And programmers are technical people from whom you should not expect the right interaction with the customer. <br><br><h6>  Possible communication channels </h6><br>  Traditional methods of communication: telephone, Skype, e-mail, non-traditional ways to communicate with the customer should also be considered. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f97/292/6da/f972926da07cd91cc10c5a199ed961f4.jpg"><br><br>  Accounting, for example, solves issues with the account manager, and they can be unpleasant to the customer and can create a bad, unnecessary background for you, as a contractor.  Or programmer's messages, debugging information in the software - all this also speaks about the quality of services and forms the customer's opinion about the contractor.  It is necessary to simulate as much as possible the channels that carry information to the customer. <br><br>  An interesting fact is that in 2006, Hitachi discovered for itself that 85% of customers build all relationships with the organization and the brand as a whole according to the experience of communicating with the contact center employees.  But the truth is, because no one can see the processes that occur within the company, even the super - competent top managers! <br><br><blockquote>  Analysis of Hitachi in 2006 showed that 85% of customers build their attitude towards the organization and the brand as a whole according to the experience of communicating with <br>  contact center staff. <br></blockquote><br>  <b>Customer Testimonials, Hitachi UK, 2006</b> <br><br>  When you call the contact center and you are poorly explained or even rude, you make a conclusion about the entire corporation.  Approximately the same is transmitted to the outsourced business.  Conclusions are made from communication with the client, even the rating is not taken into account, if he is rude, he will not work with you. <br><br><h5>  What the customer appreciates </h5><br>  If we consider the situation on the part of the customer - you come to the service station, what are the most interesting things that you expect to hear from the contractor, so that the relations for you become more transparent, clear and you would like to work with this contractor rather than run across the road and look for other?  Speak, what things would you like to hear? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fdb/38e/ddc/fdb38eddc9d3ded6655d8dd4f1b2cb14.jpg"><br><br>  The transparency of the procedure itself.  The man came and he should have an understanding that he was heard, there is a plan of action, and he sees that the work is going on, and in a week a part of the work will be ready, there is an assessment and a contract. <br><br>  The problem of ‚Äúcommon language‚Äù requires attention - a separate topic for the whole lecture.  Sometimes the customer communicates in his bird language, and the outsourcing company seems to hear it, but in a completely different way, it broadcasts to him everything in other terms and there is a misunderstanding.  These omissions can grow into more. ... Even at the level of TK, terms can be interpreted ambiguously.  This is a slippery, global topic of understanding between the customer and the contractor. <br><br><h5>  Impression management </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d94/4a6/7d6/d944a67d6f58128a635508e93fd5b5e9.jpg"><br><br>  Professionalism, friendliness - the list is quite large, but some things are quite obvious.  To manage impressions built model.  There are sels-managers - they have promised a lot, then the time of facts comes, the work is in full swing, something is moving, and we get results.  If a company performs what managers have promised, then we have confidence as to the company that is responsible for its words.  And if the managers promised, and the company made only 10% of this and almost died in the works, then the customer‚Äôs trust can be undermined. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion: it is necessary to promise less, but it is recommended to do more.</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dd7/c71/7c2/dd7c717c26256525c0e666f573ef9d2c.jpg"><br><br>  If we consider such a model, we have ‚Äúexpected-not expected‚Äù, ‚Äúcompleted - not executed‚Äù.  Sector top right "Satisfaction" - this is when we promised and did, nothing special.  If something is expected and not done, then it is a failure.  But, in fact, our function is to surprise, it is pleasant to bestow the customer.  So he fell in love with the company, called his friends and brought new customers.  Our goal is to perform such things that were not expected, but would be pleasant, and caused admiration from the customer.  One of the well-known recommendations: <b>Unsubscribe, but exceed</b> . <br><br>  Make gifts.  You have heard that the customer really needs some kind of trick, and according to the plans it will be in a week, and you will issue it in two days.  And sell this idea to him and say that you have withdrawn people from other projects.  You heard that he needed it and tried to make it faster.  If you managed to do something faster - sell it as a feat, you were so tense, undermined, it was possible in a week, and you did now: ‚ÄúI hope you will like it‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f28/7de/e69/f287dee695502b8494e61355a35a174a.jpg"><br><br>  There is an interesting book <a href="http://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/2383362/">‚ÄúThe Economy of Impressions‚Äù</a> by the authors Joseph Pyne and James H. Gilmore, who prove that the modern economy has already departed from the old classical model - a raw-material economy and a service economy and has come into the realm of impressions.  It is not enough for us to simply buy goods, not even enough goods together with the service - we need ‚Äúwow‚Äù. <br><br>  In 2002, the Israeli-American psychologist Daniel Kahneman received the Nobel Prize in Economics.  Classical economics textbooks claim that economics is rational, a classic textbook proves that a person makes a rational choice.  A bad product must die, and a good product must be successful.  In his research, Daniel Kaneman quite well demonstrated that the modern economy is rather complex and irrational.  And far from being so classic, as textbooks on classical economics require. <br><br>  A simple example: you come to the store - there are a lot of washing powders.  How to uniquely assess which one is better?  One is more expensive, but in fact it may not be worth the money.  The other is cheaper, but in fact erases better than the expensive one.  Half of the market participants are buying something from <ul><li>  for what they like: </li><li>  green packaging, not yellow, </li><li>  because he was advised </li><li>  Yesterday was such a cool advertisement </li><li>  or just have to try. </li></ul><br><br>  The choice is rather <b>subjective</b> . <br><br>  There are TV shows of the type: ‚ÄúConsumer‚Äù, ‚ÄúYour Choice‚Äù, where information about tests, chemical compositions of powders, where mothers of many children are asked, which powders they erase, which are good, which are bad, collect extensive information and more reasonably report that some the powder, in their opinion, worth its money, but some not worth it.  But all of you understand that these programs have been seen by 10% of buyers and have a weighted point of view about a particular laundry detergent.  And most of them buy for some irrational reasons, because they liked something. <br><br>  Our duty is to form a rational impression at the customer, because he is not able to objectively evaluate you in your abilities, even to form a better opinion than you actually stand.  We will strive for this. <br><br>  Another important point - time dulls the impression.  If we believe in impressions, and give gifts to us every day, then in a month you will ask: ‚ÄúAnd what is all?  Something a little, I want more ... ".  This recommendation - ‚Äúpromise less, but exceed‚Äù - this is good, but you cannot follow it 100%.  If you keep doing it all the time, you will drive yourself, and the fact of constant gifts devalues ‚Äã‚Äãa little the fact of gifts. <br><br>  Here you need to change the process.  If you have a gift, you need to explain it, that it is not from the bay, came and presented, but tensed, made sacrifices, you need <b>to sell the</b> gift.  You also need to say that next time this will not work - just an exceptional situation.  There were free people on the project, and we threw them.  So that the customer does not expect and the gift would be a pleasant surprise for him, and not that he said that this is so cool and you can hand over everything twice as fast as planned, let's reduce this plan! <br><br>  It is necessary that the customer understands that the gift is an exceptional situation - it is really tense, worked at night, and it may be worth throwing the premium - but it was a gift, with a sacrifice. <br><br>  Further, involve the client in the development, so that there is no opinion that you came, took the order and returned only with a positive result - it turns out a continuous positive, such great guys, that they then slow down - they would come with good news more often.  And if you engage in the development, cause empathy in him - these are the time needed to be lengthened, so that he gets involved in the essence of the problem, realizes that you have done a feat somewhere, donated something, and you have to move the deadlines somewhere must go to a meeting. <br><br><h5>  Case - <b>Internet provider.</b> </h5><br>  There are 2 internet providers on the market.  The old one has many clients, it works well, well, relatively well, there are always problems, but it performs its function.  But what's the point: service companies have a sin, just like with the Internet, do you all know your internet provider?  Who is your ISP in the company?  Very often, the name is remembered only when you need to call support service and yell angrily at all that you think about them. <br><br>  If everything is okay with you, everything works and you are done by sending a letter of thanks or you can call the support service or hang in line for half an hour and say ‚Äúthank you, work smartly‚Äù, there is no desire.  But when something does not work here, you remember.  What opinion do you have about the ISP? - It is with an emphasis on the negative.  When bad - you call there, and when good - it should be so. <br><br>  And they actually have a disaster there - to drop equipment every other day, and you do not know all this.  Only two technicians serve 100 clients, for the sake of clients they make sacrifices, and you know nothing.  And you do not want to understand this and you do not need it, you have enough of your business. <br><br>  And here a new provider appears on the market - it has capacities with Gulkin nose, and he comes and starts to unfasten clients.  And why?  Because he comes and asks: "Guys, how is your relationship with the old provider?" "It seems normal, but there is a jamb there and there."  ‚ÄúAnd let's come to us - we will not have shoals.  We have new super technologies.  And the old has old technologies - we should forget about it at all. ‚Äù  Well, the client agrees and decides to try. <br><br>  We mean here that, nevertheless, the old Internet provider fulfills its obligations at a good level, and the new one didn‚Äôt actually offer anything revolutionary, it‚Äôs the same, but it grabs customers, because the customers are tired and they have a negative background about their provider.  How did the old ISP solve this question? <br><br>  Before that, he had no customer support service, there was only a sales service for finding new customers.  And old customers will not go anywhere, that work with them ... <br>  So, they created a support service, and she dealt only with customers who had already bought everything for a long time.  At least they got feedback.  They began to work with them, regularly asking whether their service suits them or not, if the client himself tells the contractor what suits him, and then a competitor comes to him and says: ‚Äúcome on, come to me!‚Äù, Then it is not correct to take and go.  I just admitted myself that the old one is satisfied, and if a competitor first came and asked: ‚ÄúHow do you like it?  Everything suits, there were shoals? ‚ÄùSo there is a precedent that can be, and skip to a new contractor - the memory is fresh about the jambs.  And when you said that everything is fine, and if something does not suit you, it is voiced and measures have been taken, work has begun to boil, you are heard, something is being corrected, it has become more interesting. <br><br>  Moreover, it is also necessary to launch some new products for old customers.  As in mobile operators.  120% of the population now has 2 SIM cards for mobile phone operators, and now they are actively selling mobile Internet as an additional product.  Already there are customers and these same customers organize the sale after the sale.  In your business, you can easily find an opportunity for consulting, try to offer development or something else. <br><br><h5>  Areas of experience </h5><br>  Then you can talk about <b>areas of experience</b> , often distinguished such as: <br>  ‚Ä¢ Engagement <br>  ‚Ä¢ Training <br>  ‚Ä¢ Aesthetics <br>  ‚Ä¢ Entertainment <br><br>  Read more about these things in the article by <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/sqalab/blog/198622/">Maria Bondarenko.</a> <br>  At this I have everything - I will be glad to answer questions. <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/224713/">https://habr.com/ru/post/224713/</a></p>
