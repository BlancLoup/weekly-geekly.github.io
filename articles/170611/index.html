And while they are at home, they are taken care of by relatives and close friends.  But now it is time to make a big step in society, in school, on the first bell and the first lesson.  But as they say, the school is still learning how to learn.  What made me think about how I would like my child to step into the educational system in the 21st century.  Being a geeky companion for myself, I concluded that an inexpensive (almost one-time) and somewhat limited tablet is needed.  My choice fell on one and ultrabudget models of the market - PocketBook SURFpad.  Why?  I will try to explain under the cut. <br><br>  The device has literally just come out and the domestic store Android-apps Yandeks.Store, which will also be discussed. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9c1/671/043/9c1671043c7558379ae6312efe6aa621.jpg">

    <h5>  Criteria, "the long way is thorny" </h5><br><br>  What is important in learning software?  An intuitive and child-friendly interface, as well as accessible and (preferably) inexpensive materials.  These requirements are fully consistent with iOS and Android with support for managing gestures and a good catalog of applications and games.  But what is important in the device itself?  Reliability and low cost.  Children have the ability to break things, lose and "give" (you are in school with no one changed the flea?).  And if with reliability almost all modern tablets are equally lousy, then the low cost palm tree is clearly behind Android devices.  Looking through the catalogs of online stores in search of something slaughter for the price, I came across products PocketBook and Wexler.  But the mother of the child made some adjustments in the TK, it was necessary to find a device that does not have a connection to the cellular networks.  Firstly, the child already has a child‚Äôs phone about the four main buttons and is not needed anymore, and secondly, you can find many cute nishtyakov on the Internet, for which the child is not ready yet, and, thirdly, I I myself remember how I was led to ‚Äúdownload a picture for 10 (500) rubles‚Äù while it was still fresh.  And if there is almost no device without Wi-Fi, then without 3G it is easy, PocketBook SURFpad. <br><br><h5>  Stuffing, "what's in the case for you mine?" </h5><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c77/eea/cc2/c77eeacc2b2cc7ef1281ff14735a3974.jpg"><br><br><ul><li>  <i>Processor:</i> 1 GHz, Boxchip A13 (Cortex-A8); </li><li>  <i>Display:</i> 7 ", TFT, 800 x 480; </li><li>  <i>Memory:</i> 512 MB of RAM, 4 GB of ROM, microSD &lt;= 32 GB; </li><li>  <i>Communications:</i> 802.11 b / g / n; </li><li>  <i>Standard size:</i> 20 x 12 x 10 cm., 285 grams; </li><li>  <i>Camera:</i> front, 0.3 Mpx; </li><li>  <i>Interfaces:</i> MicroUSB (12 MB / s), 3.5 mm.  audio, 2 speakers of 0.5 watts. </li></ul><br><br>  You can find fault with the low resolution and the seemingly ‚Äúgrain‚Äù, as well as the absence of Bluetooth, but if I personally didn‚Äôt need Bluetooth, then the devices with the displays were worth a little bit more money.  Here, the issue price is <a href="http://www.pocketbook-int.com/ru/products/pocketbook-surfpad">3,500 rubles</a> . <br><br><h5>  Testing, "Yes, I play around for a while" </h5><br><br>  Of course, the device requires initial setup.  And I - meet their own curiosity.  The device was thrown into a bag with the promise "as soon as - so right away", but "only" came before a business trip with an 8-hour journey on the train Petersburg-Moscow.  In order to entertain himself, he wrote down a dozen of the series of the Game of Thrones (Game of Thrones) series on a USB flash drive and left.  Spending the battery of a voracious smart seemed blasphemous, and it was then that a multimedia reader came to mind (yes, the device is positioned as a reader, although I can easily classify it as a tablet).  The 32 GB card was really determined, and the 720p video started playing without problems.  On the road, I could not sleep, but the device was at the minimum backlight ottarabanil all 8 hours (and even a couple more on top).  By the end of the way, the 3,000 mAh battery wanted to kiss, and praise myself for the find.  Then the test and dragged on. <br><br>  The device began to drag me everywhere and everywhere in the same compartment with a notebook, sometimes replacing it.  The design of the device also has, such a smooth rectangle with grooves for the thumbs (just lovely after the iPad and Nexus 7) and sides 10 by 20 cm. With a weight of 285 grams allows it not to be noticed for a long time in the bag.  The device itself according to the marketing wand belongs to the class of "readers", where it resides in almost all catalogs along with the parent company, most of whose product range is a very e-ink device.  And with the task of reading <a href="http://store.obreey.com/rus">electronic books</a> (you can buy in the <a href="http://store.obreey.com/rus">Obreey Store</a> ), magazines and pages of the Wild Wild Web cope, only God forbid you after this to read Soviet newspapers, ugh, from some Retina display.  The elbow can be mercilessly bitten off.  And for access to the charms of the network on the road for my beloved, I found an elegant way - Wi-Fi-gateway on the phone or mobile Yota-router. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7f7/2dc/70c/7f72dc70c32659844443fc4d51df640b.jpg"><br><br>  But on arrival and colorful waving hands with a description of impressions SURFpad selected the mother of the child.  And also decided how to load tasks.  Here, it was already entered into viewing endless videos from VKontakte (VC client is built-in) and flashed into toys.  But then the main shortcoming of the ‚Äúreader‚Äù came to light - the lack of a catalog of applications.  That is, formally, it is in the form of the Opera Store, although it appears to the Norwegian store as a similar netbook on Android on TTX.  But this Opera Store is working so slowly and buggy, that it would be better to hope to install something and not give it.  And the whole thing is in deductions - installing Google Talk and Play (all the rest of YouTube and Chrome are just going to load) costs some money from each device manufacturer sold, which significantly increases its price for the consumer (dear <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/milfgard/" class="user_link">Milfgard</a> in the recent topic <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/mosigra/blog/169875/">tore off covers</a> ).  Therefore, manufacturers sacrifice this moment in order to preserve the budget of products.  Therefore, my personal cross was an eternal pilgrimage on w3bsit3-dns.com for broken, i.e.  free software (smile).  But my agony with a raised visor rushed to stop Yandex.Store, a new catalog of Android applications, with blackjack and moderators. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/11d/49d/c8a/11d49dc8a197297594f5c0f3d8dacad6.jpg"><br><br><h5>  Yandex.Store, ‚Äúfor every creature - a pair‚Äù </h5><br>  I have never liked Google‚Äôs attempts at UI.  Outstanding (without fools) gentlemen programmers spat on the appearance of their own ring of services for a long time and only in recent years "designers have been released from the cage."  And what I see now ... subjectively, borrowing and testing the pen.  I think more than one year will go to the formation of a single, unique, and for a kilometer recognizable style of search supergiant.  Yandex‚Äôs visual design has always been more or less consistent.  He could not be too bold, bold and modern, but he felt the work of many hundreds of people, done conscientiously.  And the first version of Yandex.Store is an order of magnitude larger than the first versions of the Google Market by several orders of magnitude, and somewhere it will give odds to modern Google Play. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ac2/02c/0f3/ac202c0f39bd587a87d6330396697c34.png"><br><br>  The newly installed Yandex catalog meets us with a login form (registration on Yandex itself is required), and immediately after entering opens the door to three pages: ‚ÄúInteresting‚Äù, ‚ÄúGames‚Äù and ‚ÄúApplications‚Äù.  On the main page are interesting products in the opinion of Yandex.  9 applications in a rotating "accordion", four - on small banners, and one - on the banner bigger.  Ends page 2-column list of 14 popular software.  In the tabs "Games" and "Applications" there is a bunch of software in many categories, the first of which is "Top", the best of the best in all categories.  The icon of each category is the icon of the leading game in it, which is a bit confusing.  Within the category, ratings for free and paid applications are separated from each other.  Going to the application page from the catalog in the left column we get a list of the four companions on the chart.  In the transition from the search results, this list is missing (smile). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ccb/e7c/9a2/ccbe7c9a2837758d4c450e12ece078a0.png"><br><br>  The set of catalog features is quite standard: evaluation on a five-point scale, short comments with substitution of the model of the device, screenshots of applications, descriptions of themselves and updates, developer contacts, as well as other applications of this publisher.  All this (except for the availability of demonstration videos) is available on both Google Play and Amazon.  But here's a great novelty - the ability to pay for the purchase, not only with a credit card, but also directly from the mobile phone account.  So far, the service is available only to MegaFon, Beeline and MTS subscribers (I flew with my TELE2 again), and MegaFon has launched its own service, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/megafon/blog/168599/">GetUpps!</a>  based on Yandex. Store back in early February.  Also pleased with the literacy of the approach to searching the catalog, which works with all the diligence of his elder brother, displaying both hints and ready-made answers as you type, as well as friends with synonyms and translations on the fly.  Separate attention deserves and evaluation system, giving the opportunity to see how many people what specific assessment set. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/39a/f70/ddd/39af70ddd4a368dcef673c6de8c56706.png"><br><br>  The current version of the application is 1.00, build 5493 dated 02.22.2013.  It is updated quite trivially, during its work, the catalog periodically asks for new versions, and if the Yandex servers subtly hint at their presence, a window appears over the application asking for an update.  The weight of the APK file itself is 6.74 MB, the installed application takes 12.5 MB in the phone‚Äôs memory, leaving only 3 MB when moving to the card. <br><br>  The catalog from Yandex will appear on PocketBook SURFpad with the nearest FOTA-firmware upgrade, but it‚Äôs not limited to one device.  Yandex.Store will also appear on Oppo Finder X907, Explay Infinity II and Surfer 8.01, TeXet TM-7043DX, WEXLER.TAB 7t, 3Q OC1020A, and Qumo Quest 450, 500, 530, 570 and 600. In addition, the catalog can be installed manually on any Android device from <a href="http://store.yandex.ru/">store.yandex.ru</a> .  Already installed on the phone, the application checks with its base and correctly identifies and, if necessary, updates.  Yandex itself has already collected over 50,000 applications on its servers since the announcement for developers.  Each application is checked separately using the Kaspersky Anti-Virus SDK. <br><br><h5>  Total, ‚Äúround dates remind the person that it is time to round out‚Äù </h5><br>  In the end, the device with a full set of educational, developing and just fascinating applications was found by the child under the tree, but in the hands of relatives, ‚Äújust playing‚Äù still sometimes flows, and sometimes it is indecent for them to stick to them for a long time (smile).  The child even found an independent use of the front camera, about which we somehow forgotten, and now enthusiastically pulls out mom on Skype, even for a time with the grandfathers.  And the application catalog gave the reader a second wind, and we hope that Yandex has provided it with not the last breath.  It is necessary to count on the fact that the quantity and quality of applications for the market of low-cost Android-devices will grow, and manufacturers will be more willing to build Yandex.Store into them (especially since they receive it not just for free, but also as a percentage of application sales).  The domestic search engine has a groundwork for breaking out of the CIS market; the catalog has been translated not only into Ukrainian, but also into English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, and Turkish.  Well, we, as consumers, will benefit from all this movement.  Well, or from the side, we'll see, in the end, we live in an interesting time! <br><br>  UPD: Yesterday the firmware update for SURFpad on Android version 4.1 was released.  This patch will also install Yandex.Store on devices of current owners.  And future buyers of devices will find Android 4.1 with a Yandex catalog already preinstalled. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/170611/">https://habr.com/ru/post/170611/</a></p>
