This will greatly change the battlefield of online commerce.  The transition of the financial sector (banks and insurance) from online presence to the use of the Internet as a tool.  Organization of sales of services via the Internet, service via the Internet, platforms for working with partners.  This year, many companies began to use the Internet as a value added service and began to blur the line between business automation and a platform for consumers.  That's cool.  There will be fewer pink frogs, more benefits for the consumer, more money for the development of businesses online.

      <b>Leonid Bugaev</b> : <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/764/e84/1ef/764e841efc994e454aed31c72d8407e8.png" alt="image" align="right"><br>  - It is much more interesting for me to speak not only about the Russian market, but about the world one.  If you plan to compete in the global market, then you should create English-language products.  The most memorable Game Insight achievements.  Huge respect to Alice Chumachenko, who made the most significant breakthrough in social games and in their access to the Android mobile platform. <br><br>  <b>Mikhail Vavilov</b> : <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fc4/ab9/e1a/fc4ab9e1a2fef3fb8f9d7bf39ef49957.png" align="right"><br>  - In 2011 a lot of events happened.  Perhaps the most memorable and popular project of the Russian development was the beginning of the LJ redesign, as well as the first phase that saw the light - the updated commenting system.  In the mobile world, I did not see any outstanding results, perhaps, except for the projects of Rospil, Rosyam and Pravo.  From events - the emergence of Windows on Nokia devices. <br><br>  <b>Mikhail Tokovinin</b> : <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e79/643/eb1/e79643eb1dfc2f11ca2a953bcb3fda20.jpg" alt="image" align="left"><br>  - Honestly, I can not highlight anything.  There is nothing to remember.  A year ago, it seemed that everything would evolve faster. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2ba/036/0ea/2ba0360ea902d910ec71d41aed2727a5.jpg" alt="image" align="right"><br>  <b>Gaidar Magdanurov</b> : <br>  - Entry of Russian applications to the global mobile application market.  The emergence of web development standards (from the Association of interactive agencies with the support of RAEC) <br><br>  <b>Sergey Urusov</b> : <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ba5/598/9f6/ba55989f60038fb21bcb06aa40bbf21e.png" align="left"><br>  - During 2011, I observed the following picture: many people came to the conclusion that it is better to work on outsourcing and execute projects for Western companies than to develop your own product.  Unfortunately, there are very few successful Russian projects.  I associate Russian successes with game development.  I will name ZeptoLab and their game Cut the Rope, for which the team won the Apple Design Awards this year - an absolute Russian success. <br>  Of the major events, the launch of the Russian app store Windows Phone 7. The Windows Phone 7 app market has shown significant growth over the year, although the qualitative composition of the market differs little from the Android Market and App Store.  For Russian developers, it is an opportunity to create applications for devices whose sales are growing, and which will be used by compatriots whose preferences should be more understandable. <br><br>  <b>What do you think, what directions in web development and development of mobile applications will become more popular in 2012 in Russia?</b>  <b>Which will subside?</b> <br><br>  <b>Alexey Persianov</b> : <br>  - I will not say =) <br>  <b>Leonid Bugaev</b> : <br>  - Web development is our main bread.  And we are not going to leave this market, we will continue to earn on it.  In 2012, the number of flash will decrease, despite the fact that in 2011 its number increased.  We pin our hopes on a strategic partnership with Adobe.  In the development of mobile applications, I am waiting for interesting and cool things related to the phonegap platform.  In my opinion, all directions will grow, as the market is still in such a small and embryonic state that it is impossible to say that something will decline. <br>  <b>Mikhail Vavilov</b> : <br>  - Abroad - the leading place will remain behind Android, thanks to DELL (reputation segment), the share of Windows-based devices will be noticeably increased and the demand for development will appear, the demand for iOS development will not fall, but it will not grow either. <br>  <b>Mikhail Tokovinin</b> : <br>  - Unambiguous trend - Android.  It is great underestimated and developers and businesses. <br>  <b>Gaidar Magdanurov</b> : <br>  - Games, social games - will grow.  News customers may decline, as more and more people will go to social networks for news. <br>  <b>Sergey Urusov</b> : <br>  ‚ÄúI think that the supersaturation of the mobile application markets and the widespread use of HTML 5 that has begun will lead to a shift towards mobile web applications.  The most popular category of applications will remain the game.  In the general case, mobile development will include the following trends: embedding the functionality of social networking clients into the application, using geo-targeting, cloud services for storing data used in the jQuery Mobile application, and other tools that allow cross-platform development where there is no need to take into account the specific features of mobile platform. <br><br>  <b>What qualities, in your opinion, should a developer have in order to become a leader in his field next year?</b> <br><br>  <b>Alexey Persianov</b> : <br>  - In my opinion, the most important qualities for a developer are responsibility, honesty, openness to cooperating with a client, readiness to change business to the requirements of the market, always high-quality work. <br>  <b>Leonid Bugaev</b> : <br>  - I think that to become a leader, you need to be not an individual developer, but part of a team.  The traits that are important for a successful company are the ability to anticipate 2 steps ahead, follow the trends of the foreign market, be able to make difficult decisions when there is still no economic benefit at the moment. <br>  <b>Mikhail Vavilov</b> : <br>  - To become a leader, the developer must love their work, have a desire to work, and most importantly - constantly engage in self-study.  You will succeed! <br>  <b>Mikhail Tokovinin</b> : <br>  - The same as in the past - to work well and earn satisfied customers and successful cases.  Our business is much more conservative than it may seem. <br>  <b>Gaidar Magdanurov</b> : <br>  - Thinly feel the needs of customers and new trends in the market.  Quickly produce quality products. <br>  <b>Sergey Urusov</b> : <br>  - To become a leader in its field, the developer must have one simple quality - perfectionism.  That is, to pay attention to the details: in the code, in the functionality of the application, its appearance.  The developer should work with the feeling that you can and should achieve the best result. <br><br>  In conclusion, we want to congratulate all readers on the upcoming New Year! <br>  We wish you a 2012 code without bugs, cool apps and cool customers! <br><br>  <b>PS</b> Leonid Bugaev sent us his <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DVr3DHhu9l3Y%26feature%3Dyoutu.be">video interview</a> from Bali.  Leonid has gone from a freelancer to the general director of the agency, and we hope that his example and the examples of our other experts will inspire you, dear readers, to achieve new heights next year. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/135492/">https://habr.com/ru/post/135492/</a></p>
