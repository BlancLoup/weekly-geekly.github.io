Perhaps, it will seem to someone too harsh, and to someone too immodest, but nonetheless. <br><br>  Personally, as a manager, I bring a lot of inconvenience to people who are dissatisfied with something, but sit silently and wait.  They are silently waiting for a salary to be raised.  Silently engaged in uninteresting work in the hope that someday I will notice it and make happy with the new project.  Silently freeze under the air conditioner and go to the hospital, without asking him to turn it off. <br><br>  People sit, silent and, silently, take offense.  And then, when the limit of expectations is reached, instead of coming to me and telling about the problem, they also silently go to a neighboring company for an interview.

      Then the text is a little bit in the ‚Äúblack‚Äù style of Glory Pankratov ( <a href="https://megamozg.ru/users/case/" class="user_link">case</a> ), but this is fashionable now.  I hope you will not be embarrassed by the appeal to ‚Äúyou‚Äù, since it better conveys the emotional component and meaning of the article. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  Monologue of the head </h5><br>  You sit, be silent and take offense at something. <br><br>  I always want to say: "Well, what a kindergarten!".  Am I a telepath?  Yes, you just have no right to be offended until you told me what the problem is with you!  Why be silent in the corner. <br><br>  If you have a problem, I am always ready to solve it.  Be sure if she does not dare, or I, for some reason, am not ready to solve it now - I will tell you about it.  But, anyway, I will think how to help you. <br><br>  If you have a need - express it.  Otherwise, no one will know about it. <br><br>  Do you have a slow computer and compile code two hours a day?  Why are you silent and remain overtime, simultaneously accumulating offense from this?  Yes, your two hours a day are more expensive than a separate build server!  Say - and I will solve your problem and either find you a new computer, or ask you to be patient until funding comes.  But I will be in the know.  And I will work on it. <br><br>  You have been with us for three years and during this time you have grown to a serious programmer, and you haven‚Äôt raised your salary?  Yes, I agree, I overlooked.  In fact, such things a manager should control himself.  But why get up and go to another company just because they have a salary of 10% more?  Just tell me about it.  Do you think I want one of the best programmers to be continuously under stress and then dump into freelance?  I am almost sure that we will agree, and you will get a promotion.  And you will be happy.  And imagine, I will be happy too.  Because (this is amazing!) I like my programmers to be happy.  Yes, and you work, happy, you will be better - a proven fact. <br><br>  Yesterday you wrote a letter with a proposal to improve the performance of the component, but I did not answer?  Let's be honest: Twenty people wrote to me yesterday, not counting spammers.  Yes, I maybe just forgot about your wonderful offer.  Come and ask.  If I still do not consider it relevant - I will tell you directly.  Or maybe I will finally dig it from the bottom of the mailbox, read it and say: ‚ÄúCool, boy!  Here is your prize. ‚Äù <br><br>  Do you think that all your life you will write accounting forms, and you want to write high-load systems?  Do you think that we have never done this, do not do it and will not do it?  And do not even ask?  Imagine, I lost my head in search of a man to whom I could entrust this task. <br><br>  Even if we do not need highly loaded systems, I will tell you directly about this.  You will know for sure that you probably need to change jobs.  And I, in general, will be ready for this.  Or maybe I will think: ‚Äúwould I try?‚Äù.  Why not? <br><br>  Have you been correcting errors in someone else's code for three months already?  You got it, but you are silent and are already sending out a resume?  Have you ever tried to tell me about this?  Otherwise, I look at you and I am surprised: ‚Äúhow do you like to dig with these elusive glitches - the other would have been outraged for a long time, and you still work.  So - like. <br><br>  There are a million such examples.  More than confident that in the life of anyone who now reads this article, they lack. <br><br><h5>  Summary </h5><br>  If you want your problem to be solved - tell about it.  Just sitting and waiting in silence is the most unconstructive solution. <br><br>  Just say it.  Yes. This is hard.  It is very difficult, because  makes you overstep your passivity and fears that they will misunderstand you.  I assure you that if you are silent, they will understand you even less correctly.  If they understand at all. <br><br>  And do not forget the old wisdom: communication is the key to mutual understanding! <br><br>  <i>PS I am aware that most of these problems should be monitored by a normal manager.</i>  <i>I simply urge you to make life easier for yourself and for him.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/118113/">https://habr.com/ru/post/118113/</a></p>
