About sleepless nights that I spent on books and encyclopedias.  That in search of material, I climbed the Himalayan mountains and descended to the bottom of the Mariana Trench.  But that would be untrue, and most importantly, lack of respect for you% username%.  And since you and I have not met yet, I do not have the prerequisites for not respecting you.  After you leave a comment on this article, perhaps my attitude to you will take some polar meaning, but this may happen in the future - at the time of this writing this has not happened yet ... <br><br>  As for the goals, they are as old as the world.  I want a little potiaritsya.  But this is not done in the style of ‚ÄúLook gang, as I can‚Äù, but with ‚Äúblackjack and ...‚Äù. <br><br><h4>  Introduction </h4><br>  Reading the article, you will often come across the term ‚Äúsocial network‚Äù.  This term is not related to the computer model of Adams social networks, implemented in Internet projects ‚ÄúFacebook‚Äù, ‚ÄúVkontakte‚Äù and others.  What they have in common is that Adams, in his writings, tried to describe the laws of networks, about which I will write.

      And the last.  The author does not give answers to the questions disturbing humanity.  The author does not impose his opinion.  The author only presents her point of view and offers her to study those whom she may be interested.  The author himself refers to this article simply as a literary work, without any claim to scientific nature. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Part 1. How it all began. </h4><br>  Once upon a time, in a distant galaxy far away, life was born on a third planet from the Sun.  As a result of some Ecumenical processes, this happened to me I do not know, but fact is a fact.  And in the Universe system a new, hitherto unknown (at the time of this writing) author did not have reliable information about other life forms appeared element with new properties and qualities. <br><br>  Man received those properties and qualities that were not previously known in the universe.  He could not only interact with other elements.  He could intelligently send and receive signals from other systems (we call this communication).  He was also able to use the experience gained by the same elements of the system as he (we call this training).  And most importantly, it allowed him to pass on his experience to the next generation. <br><br>  Before humans, this was done using the mechanism of genetic memory.  Which, although reliable, has a restriction on information that can be transmitted with its help.  These restrictions are necessary in order to avoid attempts to change information by other elements of the system for their own purposes.  Any attempt to ‚Äúhack‚Äù the protocol is severely punished with the exception of the offender from the network (an example is the Mules: Mules have no offspring. The Mule female and male are deprived of reproductive function).  The same system comes as a result of an error, any failure and - a dead end (mutants also can not multiply). <br><br>  The person began to use a social network for information transfer.  Man did not invent a social network (the whole universe is a huge network of interacting elements, each of these elements is formed by smaller networks), he just began to use it in a new way. <br><br>  And since the social network was just a superstructure above the low-level system, the conflict did not occur.  The philosophy of using high-level systems allows the free use of its mechanisms.  This allows a more flexible use of the system for solving various tasks.  It also allows you to create your own add-ins to solve the problems of the elements of this system (the network can build a network inside itself and use elements of another network to build a new network). <br><br>  One of the most long-lived "add-ons" - a system of networks, which we call the "state".  This is a network uniting people according to their geographical place of residence.  By the way, taking this opportunity, the author conveys greetings from the residents of Christiania, to all those who firmly believe that without the ‚Äústate‚Äù and the authorities, the life of society is impossible. <br><br><h4>  Part 2. What do we have now? </h4><br>  As a result, humanity has at its disposal a tool that can be manipulated at its own discretion.  Mankind has the opportunity to set the rules within its network, even if these rules differ from the basic laws of the Universe.  I do not set myself the goal to tell you about the positive and negative aspects of this approach.  Who understands and sees everything.  But I will give an example by which you, I hope, understand why nature so tightly controls the transfer of information through genes, prohibiting any interference with its processes.  As an example, I use the already mentioned state.  As a result of the freedom that network elements receive, elements appear that attempt to use the system and its status in it for purposes other than creating the network itself.  Such elements are called ‚Äúparasites‚Äù, and the social network of such ‚Äúparasites‚Äù is called ‚Äúcorruption‚Äù.  I beg you not to confuse these links with another phenomenon - ‚Äúsymbiosis‚Äù. <br><br>  In its essence, corruption is an attribute of any artificial system, the rules of which differ from the fundamental laws of balance existing in the Universe.  Free use of the status element gives not only the competitive advantage of the network as a whole, but also the ability to parasitize.  And socialization mechanisms allow parasites to attract new elements into their networks.  Thus, the network is ‚Äúinfected‚Äù and if the capabilities of the tools used by the network for auto-balancing are not enough, then the network ceases to exist.  She simply dies. <br><br>  Byzantium, the Roman Empire and even the USSR disappeared as a result of the domination of elements with worse qualities over elements with the best quality characteristics.  And since such a state of affairs is not characteristic of nature, in which, as a result of natural selection, the strongest is at the top of evolution, these systems simply did not have the right to exist.  Here we come to the main law of social networks.  Despite the fact that social networks themselves are an artificial product, they are subject to basic laws.  And the contradiction with the basic laws leads them to destruction (conflictologists call it ‚Äúconflict-catastrophe‚Äù) or rebirth in a new capacity (conflict experts call it ‚Äúconflict-pulsation‚Äù).  The maximum approximation to the basic laws allows the system to remain in a balanced state (conflictologists call such a system non-conflict).  If the network is initially substandard, then it simply - simply does not begin to function as it was intended. <br><br><h4>  Part 3. The right parcel is the key to success. </h4><br>  In this part, I wanted to give a small part of the message to Habralyuds, among whom there are probably many talented people who set themselves in the future the goal of creating their own computer model of a social network.  I wanted to, but I won't.  For the value of information is determined by the difficulty of accessing it, and the reader's intelligence is the natural limiter of the access level.  I will say one thing - it is always important what your product gives to society, and what it wants in return.  In a social network, an agent must give more than it receives.  If you want to receive material values, then in return you should give an order of magnitude more intangible values ‚Äã‚Äãequivalent to the value of your needs.  This behavior is also called Love.  Love is one of the most important fundamental values ‚Äã‚Äãpossessed by mankind. <br><br><h4>  Afterword. </h4><br>  Does% brandname% like me?  Not!  Why?  He needs me to buy his% trendname%.  He is just trying to manipulate my needs. <br><br>  Does mom love me?  Of course yes".  Moreover, it is not even an axiom and not a truism.  This is just a fact.  Moreover, she loves me differently and in any condition.  Even if she is angry with me or scolding me for something, at that moment she still continues to love me.  And what's even more amazing.  She loved me yesterday, loves today and, whatever happens, loves me ahead for the future. <br><br>  As you can see,% username%, on social networks, many agents spread false signals.  These signals are disguised as true values, but they are a false signal of a corrupt element that aims not to give, but to take something from you. <br><br><h4>  Instead of a conclusion. </h4><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/AR_YyqNQJAE%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500000,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhhdFjo36SI55t4z30ihRJsIhwgwLA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  PS Can move somewhere to the blog or let it lie here? <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/69441/">https://habr.com/ru/post/69441/</a></p>
