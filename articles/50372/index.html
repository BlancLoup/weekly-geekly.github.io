  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The wave of phishing online banking</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  First the details.  Today (January 27, 2009), by e-mail, I received a letter allegedly from my bank with a request to ‚Äúconfirm the electronic signature‚Äù, otherwise ‚Äúaccess from 01/31/2009 will be closed‚Äù.  In the letter, the link of the form: <a href="http://74.55.162.23/ibank2.htm">74.55.162.23/ibank2.htm</a> <br>  On the face was a clear phishing attempt.  Signs of a fake: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><ul><li>  Link to ip address, not to the domain of the bank </li><li>  IP is in the USA </li><li>  Letter headers are tampered with.  Return-Path and Recived contain the real shipping address, From - the bank address. </li><li>  When clicking on a link, an exact copy of the login form is opened in the Internet bank.  Except that in the original it is a java-applet, and for scammers it is an html-form.  Minded, by the way, with errors :) </li></ul><br><br>  Of course, I did not leave any requisites to the scammers, and instead sent a letter to my bank asking them to warn the other customers.  I think not all of them are IT specialists and are able to detect fraud at first sight. <br><br>  If anyone is interested, I can post a screenshot of the letter - it's done relatively well.  Oddly enough, the letter did not fall into spam (my mailbox is in gmail), which indicates good preparation.

      Why did I decide to write about it in Habr√©?  This case brought me to the following thoughts.  Under the guise of the crisis, many employers decided to reduce their staff and on the street, besides all the others, turned out to be a lot of IT specialists.  Yes, of course, most of them are beginners.  But, I think, a certain percentage of "bison" also pleased under the distribution. <br><br>  Where to go, everyone decides for himself.  But in the current situation, for many, regardless of their qualifications, finding a job was not easy.  In the legal sphere.  Criminal structures have no crisis, but I think there is a shortage of personnel.  Therefore, if in an ordinary situation, such an experienced IT specialist did not even look in the direction of ‚Äúunclean‚Äù work, now, there may not be a choice - everyone wants to eat.  Therefore, the criminal element received a fresh influx of personnel with extensive experience in various areas of information technology.  And in the near future we should expect an increase in attempts of various kinds of frauds implemented above the usual level.  Therefore, I urge everyone to keep their ears open, increase their vigilance and be ready to repel the attacks of the enemy :) And most importantly, do not forget about your friends, relatives and colleagues - they can easily fall for the crook of our crooks without our help. <br><br>  In general, it‚Äôs sad, comrades, it‚Äôs sad that many bright minds will go to the dark side. <br><br>  All this, of course, only my thoughts, which may not coincide with the opinions of other people. <br><br>  ps If anyone is interested, then the name of the bank is Rus-Bank-Ural, I myself am in Yekaterinburg.  But I think that a wave will soon be coming in other banks and other cities. <br><br>  <strong>UPD:</strong> <br>  So that the respected Habrovites wouldn‚Äôt have any thoughts about the ‚Äúyellowness‚Äù of the title, and ‚Äúthe author‚Äôs anxiety because of a single case,‚Äù I would add that many of my friends today came under such mailings, which prompted me to write this note.  And after talking with friends from the security service of <strong>another</strong> equally large bank, unofficial information was received.  The fact that my case is far from being isolated.  That rogues are not limited to phishing.  There have been precedents for using Trojans to steal Internet banking access details.  Banks, by the way, prefer not to make such cases public, and it is not known whether they will return the money to the victims.  It is because I have information about the mass character of this newsletter within Yekaterinburg, and there is no data on other cities that I put this topic in my personal blog, and did not post it, like many authors of the ‚Äúyellow articles‚Äù in the thematic general blog. <br><br>  In addition, the main topic of the note is not the phenomenon of phishing as such, but the desire to draw the attention of people employed in the IT field (both managers and simple programmers and system administrators) to the inflow of reduced (deservedly and not so) personnel to the dark side of the IT industry . <br><br>  I myself do not like yellow little articles fanning an elephant from a fly.  But before dismissing things that are obvious to you as specialists, I urge you to once again pay attention to the educational program of our friends, colleagues and loved ones when dealing with critical information. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/50372/">https://habr.com/ru/post/50372/</a></p>
