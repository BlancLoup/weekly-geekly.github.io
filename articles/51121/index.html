  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why is it time to leave ICQ, where and how easy it is to do</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today I‚Äôll tell you why ICQ is bad, how to deal with it, which clients and protocols it is worth switching to, and which ones don‚Äôt, why many, knowing that ICQ is crap, continue to use it, etc. <br><br>  <strong>So let's start in order:</strong> <br><img title="icq2" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/616/58f/b1d/61658fb1d09a2bbc785520711def6616.png" alt="icq2" width="365" height="84"><br>  <strong>What's wrong with ICQ?</strong> <br>  In spite of its main advantage (namely, a huge prevalence), the ICQ protocol has one very big minus - the <strong>protocol is closed</strong> and not documented.  Translated into Russian: no one (except for the developers) fully knows how the client should communicate with the server.  This means that having changed something in the protocol, all unofficial clients automatically <strong>stop working</strong> .  It is this last time with noticeable regularity that is happening, and it is happening I must say not by chance.  This phenomenon has a completely understandable reason.  AOL (the company, the owner of ICQ) earns on advertisements that spin when using the official client, alternative clients (such as QIP or Miranda) do not show ads, thereby reducing the company's revenue.  In order to somehow resist this phenomenon, AOL changes the protocol, and all owners of alternative clients remain without ICQ for a while, until the developers of alternative clients release new versions.  Part of the people who do not want to follow the updates, do not like periodic drops, etc.  decide to go to the official client (read watch ads).  We do not enter into this part.  The rest who do not want to watch ads and put up with the constant problems go to other networks, namely jabber. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img title="no_skype-1" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a29/cb6/5c7/a29cb65c76afa52fe17e470a399962df.jpg" alt="no_skype-1" width="180" height="180"><br>  <strong>Why is Skype not an alternative?</strong> <br>  Many users after several changes to the ICQ protocol <strong>went to Skype</strong> and did it <strong>in vain</strong> .  I will not say that Skype is more of an ip telephony than IM, this is understandable, something else is important.  Skype is exactly the same closed project, you just do not give an alternative to choosing a client and if tomorrow the owner of Skype decides to show ads on the entire monitor screen, you will have only 2 ways: refuse to use or watch this ad.  Turning to Skype, you change, in fact, awl on soap.

      <strong>Where to go or why jabber?</strong> <br><blockquote>  Jabber is an instant messaging and presence information system based on the open XMPP protocol. </blockquote><br>  The main words in this quote are: " <strong>open protocol</strong> ".  This means that anyone can develop their own client, and if it is written correctly, it will work and no company will ever be able to make this client stop working.  In other words, no downfalls, expectations of new versions and panic, why it does not work. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/54c/2e0/52f/54c2e052faa31248b170bc429cb28c8d.jpg" alt="400px-jabber-bulbsvg" title="400px-jabber-bulbsvg" width="180" height="270"><br>  <strong>Jabber is easy.</strong> <br>  Almost certainly you have a <strong>jabber account</strong> !  If you use <strong>QIP Infium</strong> , <strong>Livejournal</strong> , <strong>Gmail</strong> , <strong>Mail Agent</strong> , <strong>GTalk</strong> , <strong>Facebook</strong> , <strong>Ya.Online</strong> , <strong>Gizmo,</strong> then you are essentially ready to go.  All the above messaging tools support jabber, are connected to each other and therefore allow communication between services, and their list is constantly expanding. <br>  What kind of client and account to use your case, a huge number of them, including QIP Infium and Miranda (if you have the appropriate plug-in). <br><br>  Personally, I chose Gmail as my account, because  It has several advantages over the others: <br><ul><li>  <strong>the ability to communicate</strong> through the web interface to work with mail <strong>without a client</strong> </li><li>  <strong>storing the history on the server</strong> (you can access the history from any computer) </li><li>  convenient search in history </li><li>  audio and video calls </li></ul><br>  I added my Gmail account as a jabber to <strong>a QIP client</strong> , i.e.  the client for communication remained the same as when I used ICQ, in other words, there is no need to get used to the new client, use what you got used to, just adds the protocol and the selected account to it. <br><br>  <strong>Why does anyone else use ICQ?</strong> <br>  Everything is simple and obvious, the only <strong>advantage of the ICQ protocol</strong> is the <strong>number of users</strong> .  Almost all your friends use ICQ and do not use jabber.  As soon as the main part of people moves to jabber, ICQ will die and this time is not far off.  I do not urge anyone to refuse completely, the most reasonable decision is to use ICQ and jabber simultaneously.  As soon as the majority join the use of jabber, it will be possible to forget about ICQ.  The blessing with each change of the protocol jabber community becomes larger. <br><br>  <strong>About myself</strong> <br>  I understand that it is difficult and practically impossible to transplant the whole world at a time to use the normal protocol.  It so happened for historical reasons that everyone has ICQ, but personally I am ready to do a lot to speed up the migration process.  That is why I wrote this article.  If you have any problem or question about setting up jabber accounts, I‚Äôm ready to help to solve this problem. <br>  From you, I ask only 2 things: <br><ol><li>  Install and configure your jabber account </li><li>  Give this article to your friends from the ICQ list, and drop the link in your diaries </li></ol><br>  For any <strong>questions</strong> related to the topic described, <strong>write</strong> to: <br>  <strong>email: rvnikita@ya.ru</strong> <strong><br></strong>  <strong>jabber: rvnikita@gmail.com</strong> <br><del>  ICQ: 490404 </del><br><br>  <a href="http://usehotkeys.ru/2009/02/05/pochemu-pora-uxodit-s-icq-kuda-i-kak-eto-prosto-sdelat/">original article</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/51121/">https://habr.com/ru/post/51121/</a></p>
