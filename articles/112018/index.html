Employees are forced to work with this stuff, even though modern PCs equipped with the latest technology are idle at home.  The same with telephones: if you are given a work phone at a company, then usually not the latest model. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The situation is not optimal, so more and more companies come up with various schemes for how to get employees to bring their own equipment to the office or send them to work home to use home appliances for the benefit of the company. <br><br>  The most popular BYOC scheme (bring your own computer) implies that the company will reimburse an employee for a substantial portion of the cost of the equipment, provided that he will work on this equipment.  The system is convenient for everyone: the company guarantees that the most modern equipment will be installed in the office, and the employee takes care of the computer as his own (in general, the way it is).

      If an employee works in a remote mode, then the company benefits twice, because then he pays out of his own pocket not only computer equipment during working hours, but also overhead costs: electricity, rent of a workplace, etc. <br><br>  The BYOC system began to be used for a relatively long time in some IT companies like Intel and Microsoft, and now even firms far from IT are switching to a similar algorithm for buying computers, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-12181570">BBC News reports</a> . <br><br>  In addition to the computer, the employee is obliged to buy a contract for servicing the equipment, and in case of a breakdown, the PC deals with all the issues on its own: calls the technician from a third-party company or takes the computer for repair.  The company has no relation to these procedures and does not spend money on maintenance.  This is a fundamentally new approach, because before each large company there was a special IT department with full-time service engineers who repaired all the equipment in the workplace. <br><br>  The obvious advantages of BOYC are cost savings (the company saves 15-20% of computer costs), increasing employee morale and productivity.  The disadvantage, according to some experts, is a decrease in the level of security in the corporate network, because from the "working" computers, employees can do what the hell knows about the Internet, including Internet games and watching flash video. <br><br>  Not every company is ready to assume that valuable corporate information will be stored on a personal and potentially unprotected computer.  The solution may be in creating encrypted "corporate" partitions on the disk and using virtual machines, but this must be some kind of standardized corporate procedure. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/112018/">https://habr.com/ru/post/112018/</a></p>
