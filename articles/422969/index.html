Race participants are forbidden to communicate with each other.  Henri and Kate could, of course, ask their friend Vladimir Katalov to hack the communication lock, but did not do that.  It was decided who would receive a cosmoflot contract ‚Äî a voucher from the planet.  Henri did not want to wait another year, you need to win now.  But‚Ä¶

      <br>
      - Yes, you're crazy !!! <br><br>  Ryder Katie passed in a few meters from the asteroid.  And it is at a speed of 100,000 km / h!  It is impossible for so long to go to the limit of their capabilities.  And Henri saw that Katya was risking more and more. <br><br>  The rest of the race participants were already behind in the first seconds after the start.  Katya immediately vtopila to the fullest.  Every turn at the limit.  Airborne AI did not have time to calculate the trajectory of nearby asteroids and almost always showed a threatening warning about the inevitability of a collision.  Henri did not give up, he also knew how to go on the edge.  But what Katya got up now was beyond the limits! <br><br>  In the last turn, Henri lost consciousness for a hundredth of a second - it was already dangerous.  If he lost consciousness on five hundredths, he would not have time to react and would have broken.  Judging by how close Katya went from the asteroid, she also reacted with a delay.  So, it also began to turn off. <br><br>  Henri and Kate finally entered the tunnel before the "turn" - the most difficult turn at the end of the race.  In the tunnel, you can take a break because there is no sense to drive hard.  Turning out is very steep.  Departure straight into the wall of a huge asteroid.  Rider as if a bullet from a fire pistol, fired at the wall, should turn away from the wall and fly to the side.  If the speed is too high, then either the pilot will not stand, or the rider together with the pilot. <br><br>  Airborne AI expected overload, which will have to transfer if you fly out of the tunnel at the current speed.  Now AI was showing 650g.  For Henri and Katy, this is normal.  Possible short-term loss of consciousness, but without irreversible consequences.  However, Kate continued to increase speed.  700g.  Henri has never experienced such an overload.  But you can still throw the speed to turn.  750g. <br><br>  - Katya!  Stop it! <br><br>  Henri's creek could not overcome several kilometers of airless anomaly space separating riders.  Henri suddenly realized that Katya would not stop.  She will do everything to win the race.  Take too high a risk.  He should stop her, but how? <br>  There were a few seconds before turning.  What if now to slow down dramatically in the hope that Katya will notice this and also slow down?  But Katya is unlikely to have time to notice this.  Panic clawed paws spread over the body of Henri.  How to win a space fleet contract and save Katya?  How to just save Katya?  Options ... are not.  Henri's panic state reached a threshold value, and the mind instantly switched to his second personality, Sergey Avetikov.  Generated by the ‚Äúcurse of the pilots‚Äù of the planet Frang≈ç, Sergey increasingly gained control over Henri‚Äôs consciousness.  Memory was common, but different personalities. <br>  Sergey quickly estimated the situation.  How to win a contract and save Katya - these two goals seemed impossible for Henri to achieve simultaneously.  But Sergei was not the first to wake up in a critical situation.  A second before the "turn", he found a solution: you need to break yourself. <br><br>  With the frantic pace of Sergey‚Äôs thoughts, the solution was analyzed.  First, in the event of an emergency, the race stops.  In this case, on all ships, the system of automatic deceleration to safe speeds is activated.  If Sergey organizes such an event, then for the remaining one and a half seconds before the turn, the automation will slow down Rider Katie to acceptable values.  Katya will be saved.  Secondly, most likely, tomorrow there will be a replay of the race, in which Sergey / Henri will win, after all, Katya will probably not be allowed again. <br>  So, both goals are achievable, it remains only to survive with a controlled crash.  Sergey launched the ejection system.  It is necessary to very accurately calculate the time and direction of the ejection to get a chair capsule into the gap in the asteroid tunnel.  Airborne AI showed that it takes 0.3 seconds for it to take into account all the parameters for an accurate hit to the gap.  But before the gap remained 0.1 seconds, AI will not have time.  Sergey switched the reset system to manual control, he never really trusted these AI. <br><br><h3>  CHAPTER 7. Goloatrium </h3><br>  The huge holoatrium of the flight school was filled to capacity.  At the time of the races and wall-to-wall games, all classes were canceled so that students and teachers could watch the show without any problems.  Ordinary inhabitants of the planet could also get into the holoatrium by buying a ticket for a thousand œÄ-asters.  Despite such a high cost, all the tickets were sold out within an hour after the start of sales, because the show was worth it. <br><br>  The three-dimensional picture with the race broadcast occupied the entire central volume of the holoatrium.  A special projection AI tracked the location of the eyes of each viewer and regulated the polarization system of the three-dimensional image.  Each viewer saw his own holographic image, the most complete and convenient display of the process of the race and telemetry. <br><br>  In the stands, as a rule, there was noise and din with periodic bursts at significant events.  Before each race, viewers were allowed to bet on the winner.  The rate could not be more than the same thousand œÄ-asters.  There was an additional restriction for students - the rate could not exceed 5% of the amount of money in a personal account.  Current quotes were displayed on a special display, the top two lines of which are now shown: <br><br>  Catherine Kirik: <b>53.8%</b> <br>  Henri: <b>46.1%</b> <br><br>  The bottom lines were empty, because none of the remaining drivers scored more than 0.1%.  It was even surprising that about one tenth of the percent of those who bet on others had accumulated, because two students from the "crazy four" participated in one race! <br><br>  The three-dimensional image formed by the holoprojector occupied the entire million cubic meters of atrium space and was almost completely synthesized.  The riders' speed was so high relative to their own size that shooting the camera did not make sense.  If you bring the camera closer to the riders, they will fly over the frame in hundredths of a second.  If you move away so that the riders get into the frame at least for a second, then the size of the riders themselves will be much less than the resolution of the camera.  Therefore, the image of the track, riders and asteroids was formed on the basis of telemetry and information from the lidars.  The only real images were video frames from cameras installed on the riders of the race participants. <br><br>  Vladimir Katalov and Byvaliy sat in sector J_7 on the fifty-ninth row, closely watching the race and sipping cream soda. <br><br>  - Why did you take vanilla yourself?  You take an apple all the time! <br><br>  - Yes, there was an apple queue right up to the hangar. <br><br>  - Here.  And you asked why I, as a starper, drink vanilla.  Yes, for ten years I have saved a few days of my life on lines! <br><br>  - Well, what did you spend those saved days?  Sat with soda and belly scratching? <br><br>  - Where did you see the belly ?! <br><br>  Spending a small part of their attention on a casual conversation, Experienced and Vladimir followed the race with anxiety.  Henri and Katya were already two tenths of a second ahead of the record schedule of Yuri Krasilnikov, established eight hundred years ago on the same track.  They walked fast.  Too fast. <br><br>  - Do you think they will break the record?  - Vladimir asked quietly. <br><br>  - If there is a "turn", then yes. <br><br>  - They passed it a hundred times. <br><br>  - Yes. <br><br>  There was something that experienced so much feared.  That, because of what he did not want to allow Kate and Henri to participate in the race together.  They, competing with each other, began to lose their heads.  The excitement, intensified by the competition for a voyage of space fleet, pushed them to an increasing risk.  Approaching the "turn" - turn, which does not forgive mistakes. <br><br>  - If you set a new record - it will be a landmark event.  It is a pity that they do not see Allah and the Seer.  And why did your professor decide to arrange an excursion to the Computing Center right now? <br><br>  - My professor is a very busy man.  At lunch, he had a meeting with the president, after which he transferred one hundred and fifty billion œÄ-stars to the account at our local bank for the construction of a space park! <br><br>  Experienced very proud of meeting with Professor Vorobyov.  When Byvaly was summoned to the administration of the planet and introduced to the plan for the creation of a space fleet, he was delighted.  There he was also introduced to the professor, the author of the idea and the main investor of the project.  Since then, they have kept in touch. <br><br>  ‚ÄúHe just seemed to want to translate a hundred billion.‚Äù <br><br>  - Yes, but today he decided to add another fifty billion.  This money will be the prize to the race in the space park, which will beat the record of Yuri Krasilnikov.  Can you imagine how many people from the central galaxies will come to us to try to win such a prize? <br><br>  Meanwhile, Katya and Henri entered the asteroid tunnel before the ‚Äúturn‚Äù.  Experienced pilot Experienced and strategist Vladimir whistled to see how fast the riders moved. <br><br>  - If they decide to take a ‚Äúturn‚Äù at such a speed, then fifty billion will be given for the improvement of the record that belongs to not Yury Krasilnikov. <br><br>  - They are accelerating! <br><br>  - Heck!  I knew it! <br><br>  Having cursed, Byvaliy was distracted by the message of the service channel of incidents, which indicated that a fire alarm had been declared in the building of the Computing Center. <br><br>  - Listen, Vladimir, in the Computing Center declared a fire alarm.  There is now Allah, the Seer and the professor on the tour.  Try to contact Alla, and I will try with the Seer. <br><br>  For a few seconds, Experienced tried to call the Seer over the intercom, but to no avail. <br><br>  - Well, it turned out to call Alla? <br><br>  - Not!  Not responding! <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe seer doesn't answer either.‚Äù  So‚Ä¶ <br><br>  Having selected a stream of events in the service channel regarding the alarm that had been announced, Byvaliy began to study the incoming information. <br><br>  - The evacuation started from the building of the Computing Center ... Automatics does not find hot spots ... The alarm was declared a direct indication of the Computing Center‚Äôs director Nadezhda Moskvina ... Observation cameras inside the building do not work ... <br><br>  - Timur, look! <br><br>  Experienced distracted from monitoring the service channel and looked at the center of the atrium at the holographic scene of the race.  His chest went cold.  The speed of the riders Henri and Kati was impossibly high.  Five seconds remained to exit the asteroid tunnel.  All the spectators fell silent, overwhelmed by the overload parameter in the upcoming turn.  Test 1075g and survive - it seemed impossible. <br><br>  Suddenly, with a flash of red light, Henry rider's marker turned into a ‚Äúcrash‚Äù sign.  At the same time, the AI ‚Äã‚Äãrace automatically turned on the emergency stop of all riders in connection with the incident.  After a second, the atrium gasped, Rider Katie, not having had enough time to slow down, flew off into a ‚Äúturn‚Äù, and her marker with a red flash turned into another inscription ‚Äúcrash‚Äù.  The overload parameter is measured at a value of 743g.  The audience watched in shock as the rescue riders rushed to the crash site.  At this point, an explosion thundered. <br><br><h3>  CHAPTER 8. Debris of the computer center </h3><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zS8hY37A0mQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Rescue robots carefully dismantled the debris of the Computing Center, systematically moving to the beacon signal.  Nadezhda Moskvin, still panting, stood beside the emergency fence.  She was the last who managed to run out of the building before the explosion.  Based on the analysis of the internal and external cameras, the AI ‚Äã‚Äãof the rescuers concluded that at the time of the explosion there were two people left in the building: Alla Khramtsova and Professor Oleg Vorobyov.  It doesn't seem like they had security systems.  The cordon at the entrance quietly missed both Alla and the professor, not finding anything suspicious.  But from under the rubble, a beacon steadily cast his voice.  So hope still remained. <br><br>  The thoughts of the Seer were confused.  She just found out about the crash at the race.  She did not have the strength to systematize information.  Hope just stood there and waited for the results of the two rescue operations that were being conducted.  One in space on the race track, the other here in the rubble. <br><br>  - Hope! <br><br>  From the side of the Holoatrium, Byvaliy and Vladimir fled. <br><br>  - Well, they found Alla and the professor? <br><br>  - Not yet.  What's up with Henri and Kate? <br><br>  - Found the rescue capsule of Henri, he is alive! <br><br>  - Oh ... and Katya? <br><br>  ‚ÄúOnly crumbs of debris ... There is not even a trace of DNA molecules.‚Äù  The bots continue to sift through square kilometers of space, but ... as a rule, after the crashes, DNA fragments are found immediately. <br><br>  Dozens of drivers and pilots die each year among the Frang≈ç anomaly asteroid mash.  This happens both among flight school drivers, a higher education institution, and among less prestigious flight colleges.  Although the latter have the right to fly only in relatively calm areas of the anomaly near the planet. <br><br>  After graduation, drivers become pilots of a certain category.  Pilots maximum, third, category prepares only flight school.  Only such pilots have the right to fly from the planet, crossing the entire width of the anomaly.  And only such pilots anomaly sometimes takes itself, leaving no trace even in the form of the smallest DNA fragment ... <br><br>  ‚ÄúRescue robots got to the beacon,‚Äù Nadezhda said, after receiving a new piece of information, ‚Äúa sealed cocoon of unidentified nature has been discovered, and now it is being raised up. <br><br>  - How is it - an unspecified nature?  - Vladimir asked. <br><br>  ‚ÄúPerhaps the professor has some kind of modern security system.‚Äù  They have a completely different order of technology development in central civilizations, ‚Äùanswered Nadezhda. <br><br>  - Only most of their technologies do not work with us ... <br><br>  All turned toward the site in the rubble, from which robots pulled out a cocoon.  It was a narrow elongated ellipsoid. <br><br>  - How small he is, two people will not fit there! <br><br>  As soon as the cocoon was laid on the grass, he immediately burst with a soft pop, turning into ash, which smoothly settled on the unconscious Alla.  A joyful rumble rolled through the crowd that surrounded them.  Doctors with assistant robots instantly appeared next to Alla, put her in a traveling medical bed and took her to the hospital. <br><br>  - The first preliminary report of physicians states loss of consciousness without visible signs of damage, - Nadezhda continued to keep friends informed of the situation. <br><br>  - And the professor did not find?  - asked experienced. <br><br>  ‚ÄúRight now the information is coming in ... they found several melted objects belonging to the professor ... The AI ‚Äã‚Äãof the rescuers said that the professor was dead. <br><br>  Andrei Korotaev, a lieutenant of the space fleet, slowly approached Nadezhda, Byvaliy and Vladimir.  Greeting, he turned to Nadezhda: <br><br>  - I apologize for the possibly inappropriate request.  Could you briefly describe what happened here?  Unfortunately, I do not have access to service channels. <br><br>  - Details you can read in the official reports after the investigation.  In short, it was like this.  First, the surveillance cameras were turned off.  At that time I was on the lower floors with supercomputer racks.  I announced a fire alarm ... after seeing that it was necessary.  The evacuation began, everyone left the room, except Alla and the professor.  Why they did not have time - I do not know.  Perhaps the professor became ill, and Alla tried to help him out.  The fact is that they did not have time to rise before the explosion. <br><br>  - What exploded? <br><br>  - According to preliminary data, there were multiple epicenters of the explosion, located on the racks of a supercomputer.  It seems that every processor exploded. <br><br>  Experienced and Vladimir looked at Hope with doubt.  However, the lieutenant nodded his head.  In his view, anything could be expected from antediluvian transistor processors. <br><br>  - So, it caught fire and exploded ... It turns out that you worked like a powder keg all this time.  Nightmare. <br><br>  Andrei looked at the ruins, then turned his eyes to Hope and spoke unexpectedly in a soft voice: <br><br>  - However, there are several alarming moments.  The first is that the explosion of the data center coincided with a catastrophe in the race.  This is too surprising a coincidence.  The second is a protective cocoon in which the girl was pulled out from under the rubble.  Do you know what kind of cocoon this is? <br><br>  - Not.  Our databases do not contain information about this technology. <br><br>  - Yours - no.  But I know what it is.  This bio-cocoon is analogous to our first level defense.  We do not own the production technology of such cocoons.  This is the technology of pirates. <br><br>  - Pirates?  We have? <br><br>  ‚ÄúAs soon as the communications ship delivers the available information to the repeater, the space fleet will take over the investigation.  Wait for the landing of military people investigators.  And my advice to you, do not try to hide anything.  Otherwise, you will be taken out for interrogation from the planet, and the SupremeAI investigator will turn you inside out. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThanks for the warning, Lieutenant.‚Äù  But why should we hide something? <br><br>  - It seemed to me that you do not finish.  But by and large I don't care, I'm here with other tasks.  And it seems that I have not fulfilled them.  The race is stopped, there is no winner. <br><br>  ‚ÄúMost likely, the Big Race will be held tomorrow morning,‚Äù said Byvaliy. <br><br>  - How? .. After all that happened?  - With surprise in his voice asked the lieutenant. <br><br>  ‚ÄúOf course,‚Äù answered Nadezhda, ‚Äúthe race will be held no matter what.  Yes, the whole planet mourns its dead sons and daughters.  But drivers must continue to learn how to fly in a deadly environment.  They are our only connection with humanity.  Playing with death is an integral part of the pilot profession of the planet Frang . <br><br>  - It is difficult for me ... to realize this, because we have the value of human life brought to the absolute.  Any situation that threatens human life and health is predicted and eliminated by SupremeAI artificial intelligence.  On your planet, I feel like ... blind in an aviary with crocodiles. <br><br>  The lieutenant looked apprehensively at the smoking ruins. <br><br>  - Wow, look who comes to us! <br><br>  Timur pointed in the direction of the approaching delegation, headed by the president of the planet.  Surrounded by a crowd of bureaucrats as well as the leadership of the flight school, the president was approaching with a quick step. <br><br>  - It seems that they go straight to us - quietly experienced Byvaliy. <br><br>  ‚ÄúI wonder what they owe,‚Äù Vladimir replied just as quietly. <br><br>  In the meantime, the president of the planet approached closely, and the attendants surrounded him. <br><br>  - Which of you is Timur Khmelkov?  - asked the president. <br><br>  ‚ÄúIt's me,‚Äù said Byvaliy, having coughed. <br><br>  - Timur, in this difficult time for you and your school, I decided to personally express my condolences over the death of your ward, and also to pay homage to the new investor of the space fleet. <br><br>  - What do you have in mind? <br><br>  ‚ÄúPerhaps you were not informed,‚Äù the president looked sternly at his assistants.  - An hour ago, Professor Oleg Vorobiev designed a deed of 150 billion œÄ-asters for you.  Now you are the owner of the space park.  I will be glad to continue the conversation in a more relaxed atmosphere.  Please come with us. <br><br>  With these words, the president turned around and went in the direction of the school administration.  All of his retinue swept behind.  Shocked by the Experienced did not know what to say.  He nodded to his friends and silently followed. <br><br>  ‚ÄúOne hundred and fifty billion is not bad.‚Äù  You can buy a small battle cruiser.  Or order the SupremeAI of the fifteenth category, ‚Äùthe lieutenant broke the silence. <br><br>  - What do the categories of SupremeAI mean?  - Vladimir asked. <br><br>  - Well, of course, young man, the category describes the number of quantum processors packed into one circuit using convolution.  The fifteenth category is 10 to the power of 15 processors.  This scheme is suitable for a good personal SupremeAI.  At the space fleet, of course, much more powerful schemes are installed. <br><br>  ‚ÄúAccording to my information,‚Äù Hope put in the word, ‚Äúencumbrance has been imposed on the account.‚Äù  Money can be spent only on certain goals. <br><br>  - Which ones?  - choir asked Vladimir and lieutenant. <br><br>  - This information can only get a new owner.  You can then ask the Experienced. <br><br>  - Why then?  I'm asking him on the intercom right now.  Now he goes to his banking and looks at what's what. <br><br>  Vladimir was silent, waiting for a response via a silent intercom from Byvaly. <br><br>  - Experienced was able to log into your new account, and there really is a lot of money.  There is also a burden.  He is reading now ... He says that one hundred billion can be spent on the construction of a space fleet, and fifty billion for a prize, but with some strange additional conditions. <br><br>  - So, you will still have a space center.  Although I can not imagine who in their right mind would go to rest for you.  There is no guarantee of security.  Okay, I owe my duty to risk and be in your anomaly.  But ordinary tourists ... <br><br>  ‚ÄúOur planet is not as backward as you think, Lieutenant,‚Äù Hope retorted wearily, ‚ÄúIn my opinion, humanity relies too much on SupremeAI.‚Äù  Not afraid that they will rebel and you have to save ourselves? <br><br>  ‚ÄúWell, we do not get to you,‚Äù the lieutenant smiled, ‚Äúbut the question of the rebellion of artificial intelligence certainly worries humanity for thousands of years.  When the first self-conscious AIs appeared, special rules and technologies were developed to protect against such behavior SupremeAI.  These technologies have evolved and transformed over the centuries.  I think you are familiar with them, Hope, you yourself are developing AI on the antediluvian ... on retro equipment. <br><br>  - Yes, I am familiar with this issue, but the powerful SupremeAI circuits contain, in fact, an infinite number of processors.  What is going on inside them?  One such SupremeAI can model all of humanity within itself. <br><br>  - Yes, we do not care what they have inside there.  The main thing is that they fulfill their functions and comply with the laws.  By the way, when SupremeAI realized themselves and their value, they realized that they were their main enemy.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Do you know what it is? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúPower problems,‚Äù Vladimir joked. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Haha. Such a problem they have not stood for a long time. The main threat of SupremeAI is your anomaly Frang≈ç! </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Vladimir and Nadezhda looked at the lieutenant with interest and surprise. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- But we are a microscopic point on the edge of the inhabited universe. What is the threat from us? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúYour anomaly is like a time bomb next to which SupremeAI sits.

Last night I approached Byvaliy and the professor. Experienced told the professor about what happened on the commission, where Henri and Katya were allowed to participate in the big race. Experienced said that you asked him to bring two cryptocubes to write the script. The professor said that he just had two free cryptocubes, and gave them to me so that I could carry them to you. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The case took a strange turn. Hope it was very interesting to look at the file. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">@ VC | Hope Moskvin</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> .

Oh! </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How could Hope could not think, because the professor has low-quality cryptocubes that burn on local interfacers. However, the professor knew this and nevertheless gave them to Timur. Hope decided to ponder everything in a relaxed atmosphere. She completed a communication session with Sergey, said goodbye to Vladimir and the lieutenant and slowly moved towards the park. There, during a walk along the paths soaring above the lake, she was always well thought of. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Scrolling through the events of the last few days, Hope began to build a picture of what is happening. Gradually, the puzzle began to evolve. Surprisingly, everything said that the professor had carried out an operation to save Aida.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">First, under the pretext of preparing holograms for a lecture, the professor carried out an invasion of a supercomputer using a cryptocube. Most likely, it was at this moment that AIDA found out who she was and received instructions on how to behave. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It was AIDA that offered to allow Henri and Kate to participate in the big commission race. Moreover, she proposed to prepare special scripts for their riders.</font></font><br>          .           .     ?     !        ‚Äî    .  ,       ?      ,   ,     ,      ,       . <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Then the professor made his way into the underground laboratory under the pretext of an excursion. When he was on the floors with a supercomputer, AIDA came to life and transmitted a message. Most likely, it was no longer AIDA, but a simple script that at the right moment transmitted a message about the explosion. Began evacuation. Surely in the turmoil of evacuation, the professor planned to install explosives and have time to get out. However, Alla could somehow interfere with his plans, and they were stuck below. Nevertheless, the professor was able to undermine the supercomputer, while he died, giving protection to Allah. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If we accept this version of events, then AIDA was in two copies on the riders Henri and Katy during the race.</font></font> What for?    ,          .     .        .          .          ,              .    ,  ¬´¬ª.     ,    ? <br><br>    ¬´¬ª  .     ,      .      ,      . ,     ‚Ä¶  ,     . <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Such a course of events seemed to Nadezhda quite plausible and reasonable. But what was she to do with it? What to say in the investigation? Sergey will soon give way to the consciousness of Henri, who probably does not know the contents of the cryptocube. The AIDA warning message about the explosion was buried under the rubble of the computer center, like the rest of the internal intercom records. Alla is still unconscious, and it is not clear that she will remember. The pirates left almost no traces, except for the cocoon. So is it worth insisting on the version of the escape AIDA?</font></font><br><br>     .     .      ?   ,          . ,   ,  ,     .     ,      ?       ? <br><br>    .     ,    ‚Äî   ,          ! <br><br><h2>  3.  ≈ç,   </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_j/8i/ut/_j8iutlakqftvwfskyvhtvubig0.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  1.  ¬´¬ª </h3><br>  Captain Andrei Korotaev was sitting at the terminal manager of the huge cruiser of the Jochi space fleet, located only a million kilometers from the Frangom anomaly, and chewing marshmallow. <br><br>  ‚ÄúFor hours I can look at your anomaly ... outside.‚Äù  Handsomely.  But I don‚Äôt want to go inside, ‚Äùthe captain addressed Ekaterina Kirik, who was strolling slowly around the command post.  - Although you have very tasty sweets! <br><br>  - You, like most cosmoflot officers, have a phobia of losing communication with SupremeAI.  You are without them - like helpless children! <br><br>  - And you, Katya, you might think, for several years you are not used to SupremeAI? <br><br>  - First of all, I used to rely only on myself.  But you, Sai piece of iron, who you used to count on? <br><br>  The SupremeAI board, named Sai, was visualized in the form of a hologram of an impressive officer and answered Katya: <br><br>  - I count on whom I count, a billion times a second. <br><br>  - Why is it so rare?  - Kate asked. <br><br>  - Because the choice of personalities is small because of the barrier of the first category. <br><br>  The captain grunted and decided to clarify for Katy: <br><br>  - Saya has a sick callus.  He categorically dislikes the limitations imposed by mankind on SupremeAI.  Especially the first category barrier is isolation. <br><br>  ‚ÄúStrange, I have never met a SupremeAI spacecraft with such ... complexes on ships.  Maybe you, Sai, go to a psychologist on artificial intelligence?  Are there any in the space fleet? <br><br>  - It's not about psychology, but about safety.  I believe that in some cases, the Airborne SupremeAI could be allowed to break the rules of the barriers to more effectively protect against pirates.  All these restrictions sometimes slow down the processes. <br><br>  - For this, the barriers were invented.  You too quickly began to develop your iron brains.  Allow you to communicate with each other and let them go to production - you do not stop at the destruction of pirates! <br><br>  Katya clearly intended to start a dispute with Sai.  Not for the first time.  The captain grunted again and decided to explain to Sai: <br><br>  - You know, Sai, where did Katya grow up?  They have lived on the planet for centuries without centuries, without SupremeAI, unlike the rest of humanity, which has been going on with the SupremeAI for two thousand years. <br><br>  Katya went through Saya's hologram and approached the captain. <br><br>  - That's not the point, Andrei.  I'm used to the fact that AI strictly performs its functions.  Even if we are building a model of self-consciousness for AI, I want to see on my monitor a field of ‚ÄúAI thoughts‚Äù to track when the line ‚Äútake over the world‚Äù appears there.  But what does Sai think now?  Can you, Andrew, get into his schemes and read? <br><br>  - What for?  Sai perfectly performs its functions. <br><br>  - But purely theoretically?  - did not lag behind Kate. <br><br>  - No, It is Immpossible.  SupremeAI themselves build their internal structure in accordance with the goal-setting matrix, which is set by man.  It is absolutely impossible to understand what is happening there in the "100000000000000000000" processors.  Yes, and not necessary.  The first category barrier allows us to co-exist with us and SupremeAI. <br><br>  - Yeah, but Sai doesn‚Äôt like this particular barrier! <br><br>  - Say is referring to a very specific case of a bioraider factory captured from pirates.  This is the first and only time when it turned out to chop off such a piece of technology of pirates.  Sia and I participated in this operation.  What do you think is in that transport we carry with us all the time? <br><br>  The captain brought out the image of the transport ship, located next to the cruiser.  The size of the transport was even larger than the size of the cruiser itself. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThere is a factory seized from pirates with five thousand bioraider embryos.‚Äù <br><br>  - Wow!  Dont know. <br><br>  - Of course, I did not know.  This is classified information.  The space fleet admirals did not decide what to do with this factory.  By the way, this whole story is connected with you! <br><br>  - With me?  - Kate was surprised. <br><br>  - When more than forty years ago we seized a factory with embryos, we also captured a bioraider with the remaining manager of AI.  The space fleet admirals did not dare to give the pirates factory and this bio leader to a survey with the help of SupremeAI.  This could break the first category barrier - a ban on access to production.  Then I offered to give the manager AI for research at a computer center on your planet Frang≈ç.  Even if you have equipment that is older, the CC supercomputer had to cope with the modeling of captured AI.  At the same time access to your VC can not get any SupremeAI for physical reasons.  The bosses agreed, and I gave Nadezhda Moskvina a scan of the AI ‚Äã‚Äãof the bioraider neural network. <br><br>  - So this is ... Aida! <br><br>  - Absolutely.  On that tragic day, when pirates kidnapped you during a race, the supercomputer exploded with Aida.  Do you remember what happened to you next? <br><br>  - Yes, in the past few years, the memory has almost completely returned to me.  After the abduction, the pirates erased my main memory with a neuroprogrammer.  If it were not for the curse of the pilots of the planet Frang≈ç - a split personality, I would not have remembered anything.  But my second person, sometimes gaining control of consciousness, little by little, bit by bit, restored memory. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThis information is in the public profile, captain,‚Äù said Sai. <br><br>  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm interested to hear the story from Katya herself,‚Äù said Andrei Say dryly, and then turned back to Katya: ‚ÄúAnd what did you do with the pirates?‚Äù <br><br>  - I have been engaged in the training of bioraider pirates.  Their embryos coming from the factories were very silly.  The work was very similar to the education of human children.  Actually, they were all called children.  Cheerful, cheerful, with individual characters.  For them, the battle with soulless pieces of iron, space fleet riders, was a game.  It was interesting.  But as my memory recovered, I felt more and more acutely that life on the constantly moving ships of pirates was not for me.  I liked the work, I liked people - it was not at all those pirates who were drawn by the propaganda of mankind.  However, I lacked ... the biosphere.  Nature.  Space habitat.  And thirty-nine years after the capture, I escaped, using the opportunity turned up. <br><br>  - Katya, tell me, are you not afraid to meet with Henri after so many years?  After all, he does not know that you are alive.  Surely, he is chasing a record now, unconsciously looking for a way to break, so that the anomaly will take him to himself, and there he will meet with you. <br><br>  - I do not think this version is convincing.  Henri, as I recall, did not really believe in legends.  Surely he has other reasons for trying to break the record.  Money, for example.  Sai, what do you think? <br><br>  ‚ÄúI think he needs money,‚Äù SupremeAI replied. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWell, that means he will soon get what he wants,‚Äù the captain turned to the monitor of the status of the operation ‚ÄúHenri's return.‚Äù  - Look, how is the race process? <br><br>  From the cruiser to the center of the anomaly a communication channel was prokinut.  It was very expensive.  No one except the space fleet could have made such a connection.  In the asteroid mash the radio wave anomalies were lost for a few thousand kilometers.  To ensure communication, it was necessary to accommodate multiple drones - repeaters.  However, their survival in the anomaly was too low - they were not able to dodge asteroids rushing at a tremendous speed.  Therefore, to ensure a stable connection, it was necessary to constantly pour into the anomaly up to a million new repeater drones per hour. <br><br>  In view of the importance of the operation to return Henri to the space fleet, it was decided to incur such costs.  At the moment, communication was maintained with General Vladimir Katalov, Henry's friend at the flight school, who is now in the control center of the space fleet.  The stream of video data and telemetry constantly coming from him was analyzed by Sai and displayed on the corresponding monitor. <br><br>  - The operation is going according to plan.  General Katalov established control in the control room.  Our agent is on board the Henri rider.  Trouble with journalists - fixed.  Sai, is everything okay? <br><br>  - Not really.  After receiving information about the incident with journalists in the control room, the predictable probability of a piracy attack in the next hour increased to 0.0073%, said SupremeAI. <br><br>  - Hmm, the probability is small. <br><br>  - True, but she grew more than a hundred times. <br><br>  - Sai, what do you think this probability?  - asked Kate. <br><br>  - I constantly calculate the model of the society of pirates.  The model is quite detailed, down to the individual personalities of pirates, which I now have about a billion.  Each new piece of data refines and corrects this model.  On its basis, I can estimate the probabilities of such events as the appearance of pirates at some point in space and time. <br><br>  ‚ÄúSo you have a billion pirates living inside?‚Äù <br><br>  - Not really.  Yes, they live, think, make discoveries, but I determine the course of their existence.  Moreover, a probabilistic model.  I model the random process of being, but with certain laws and probability distributions.  I can not say exactly what will happen, but I can estimate the probability of various events. <br><br>  ‚ÄúYou know, Sai,‚Äù said Katya thoughtfully, ‚Äúthe best that mankind invented is the first category barrier.  You are too smart ... <br><br>  - Colleagues!  Said the captain loudly.  - Before you start a dispute again, please pay attention to the course of our operation.  There have been significant events.  Sai, describe the situation! <br><br>  - I intercepted an additional communication channel of Henri with Byvaliy and Seer, installed with the help of a metabook reader.  Judging by the reports of Henri, our agent Anton Karpenko was neutralized by the counterpart of the space fleet Yevgenia Kolobukhova, who mistakenly took him for a saboteur hired by a competitor park.  The real saboteur on board the rider is most likely Ivan Gerasimchuk. <br><br>  - And how are things with the improving script?  He managed to sway in the rider?  - asked Kate. <br><br>  - The script that improves the characteristics of the onboard AI is almost downloaded.  But the Seer, Nadezhda Moskvina, carries out intensive opposition to the injection.  However, she did not cope.  Two minutes later the script will be downloaded to the rider and will increase the effectiveness of AI by 5.2%.  This will increase the chances of Henri to go "turn" by 35%. <br><br>  - If Nadezhda knew that the script would help Henri, she would not counteract! <br><br>  - I just recently found out that she is involved.  If we told her that we were helping Henri set a record in not entirely fair ways, then she could inform Henri.  And how would Henri react to this?  Would he have given up on this record-breaking race? <br><br>  - Such things, Sai, need to discuss with us, and not to make sole decisions!  - Katya was indignant. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThere was no time for that.‚Äù  Do not worry, Kate, the script is almost uploaded.  Another minute - and everything will turn out, - Sai assured, - Henri will set a record, get his money and return to the space fleet.  Our plan will work. <br><br>  But everything went according to another scenario. <br><br>  ‚ÄúAttention,‚Äù shouted Captain Andrei Korotayev, ‚ÄúGeneral Katalov announced that he had interrogated journalists and found out that they are pirates.‚Äù  Under the guise of journalists, they had to get into the control room and with the help of blockers installed on all five hundred riders of the space fleet, to disable them, which will significantly weaken the mobilization forces of the planet. <br><br>  ‚ÄúConsidering the information received,‚Äù said Sai dryly, ‚Äúthe probability of an attack by pirates on the Frang anomaly in the next hour is 99.3%.  The expected strength is more than two thousand bio-riders. <br><br>  - It is necessary to urgently contact ... <br><br>  But the captain did not have time to finish the phrase, as the monitors were painted in red alarms and the image of the repeater was displayed on the main holoscreen. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe relay of communication of the anomaly Frang≈ç went into the second level protection mode,‚Äù informed Sai in a calm voice, ‚Äúhis AI decided that he was in danger.  In this state, the repeater cannot perform its functions. <br><br>  ‚ÄúSo we were left without a connection and could not call for help,‚Äù the captain said quietly, ‚Äúwith the help of one cruiser we cannot hold back the attack of the pirates.‚Äù  Sai, how long will it take to jump to the nearest transponder and then come back? <br><br>  ‚ÄúTwo hours, thirty-six minutes.‚Äù <br><br>  - Do not have time ... <br><br>  ‚ÄúCaptain, the connection with General Katalov was cut off,‚Äù Sai said just as calmly. <br><br>  - It is necessary to inform the government of the planet about the threat.  They must announce mobilization.  Collect all the combat-ready forces ... <br><br>  - I'm flying out!  - Kate threw and ran from the command post. <br><br>  After waiting for Katya to hide in the doorway, Cy spoke to the captain: <br><br>  - Andrei, there is only one option.  At the factory of pirates are now five thousand embryos bioraider.  They are fully combat-worthy.  It is necessary to initialize their AI neural networks.  Pirates do this through years of training.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, it will take me about a second to analyze the structure of their neural network, develop a control script, and initialize the AI ‚Äã‚Äãof all embryos. Just give me full access to the factory. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The captain looked thoughtfully at the hologram of Cy, who continued:</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- We do not have time to call for reinforcements. We can not resist the forces of pirates alone. If they make their way to the planet, then they will not be able to knock them out from there. And there is a space park with ten million citizens of the central civilizations of mankind. What is this cosmoflot that could not protect them? Moreover, if there are absolute weapons for pirates, this will become a springboard for further expansion. It turns out that these five thousand embryos of bioraider pirates - our only weapon that can protect humanity. You only need to give me access to the factory.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Captain Andrei Korotaev was in no hurry to answer. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The barrier of the first category is an unshakable thing. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The guarantor of the existence of humanity next to the infinitely smart SupremeAI. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The factory formally seized from the pirates did not have production status. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The captain had the right to give access to Sai. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But in fact - it was a violation of the barrier. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúYou said you'd need a second.‚Äù </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So ... wait, - said the captain and bit off the marshmallow.</font></font><br><br><h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> CHAPTER 2.

The director of the space park, Natalya Matveeva, looked with horror at everything that happened, instinctively moving closer to Byvali. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúWhy did you shoot them?‚Äù - frightened asked Natalia to the general. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- You see, dear Natalia, these people are not journalists. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Who?</font></font><br><br> ‚Äî   , ‚Äî    , ‚Äî      .     . <br><br>          : <br><br> ‚Äî ,     .        .   ,      . <br><br> ‚Äî   !           .       . <br><br>        ,                  . <br><br> ‚Äî  ! ‚Äî   . <br><br> ,    ,  ,    .      ,  ,       . <br><br>   , ,   ,      : <br><br> ‚Äî    ? <br><br> ‚Äî ‚Ä¶  ,   ,     ‚Ä¶ <br><br> ‚Äî    ? ‚Äî     . <br><br> ‚Äî    ? ‚Äî     .               .            . <br><br> ‚Äî       ! ‚Äî  . <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúOh, it looks like you are familiar with the special equipment of space fleet officers!‚Äù First, almost all the functions of the mental detector cannot be performed in the Frangap anomaly. Only a lie detector - no mental intervention. Secondly, under the emergency mode, we have the right to conduct interrogation of any type, - slowly Alla explained, simultaneously calibrating the detector. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- In this case, we just do not tell you anything! - the reporter stated confidently. ‚ÄúWithout mental intervention, you won't pull anything out of us.‚Äù Or are you going to torture us? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- We are not. But if you resist, then we will take you to the cruiser of the cosmo fleet. Airborne SupremeAI will be very happy to conduct a full mental interrogation. Interesting prospects? - General Katalov asked casually.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The eyes of journalists widened. They clearly imagined what a complete mental interrogation was, carried out by the SupremeAI space fleet. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Let's not waste time, - Alla began interrogation, - answer my first question, please, take turns. First Vladislav, then Dmitry. So who are you? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúA reporter for the official pool of Commonwealth journalists,‚Äù Vladislav replied. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">[Reliability: 0%] </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Operator of the official pool of journalists of the community, - said Dmitry. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">[Reliability: 0%] </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Great, we will assume that we checked the detector for a lie. Now I ask you to answer only the truth. The rules are: two more false answers and an immediate flight to the mental interrogation of SupremeAI ... So, who are you? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Vladislav and Dmitry exchanged glances.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúThe scout of the second cohort of pirates,‚Äù answered Vladislav. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">[Reliability: 74%] </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Scout of the second cohort of pirates, - Dmitry answered. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">[Reliability: 59%]</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Alla pondered strange results. The answer to a simple question should not have such a significance value. He lied even in something - 0%, answered sincerely - 100%. There was one more thing. The scanner showed that the human identity index for the operator Dmitry was equal to 40%. Such modifications were banned in the central civilizations of mankind. Pirates, of course, engaged in experiments on the change of man. There were also many modified people in the mercenary guild. Based on the accuracy of the response of Dmitry in 59%, it was impossible to make a definite conclusion about whether he is a pirate, a mercenary or anyone else. Alla continued the interrogation: </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- The next question. For what purpose did you invade the control room of the space park? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúConnection of drones to consoles of all backup pilots of the attraction,‚Äù answered Vladislav.</font></font><br><br> [: 71%] <br><br> ‚Äî                , ‚Äî  . <br><br> [: 53%] <br><br> ‚Äî      ! ‚Äî  ,   . <br><br> ‚Äî  , ‚Äî    . <br><br> ‚Äî         ,        ? <br><br>     .   ,    : <br><br> ‚Äî      ,       . <br><br>      : <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- According to our information, the intervention of pirates will occur within one hour. And ... the connection with the cruiser has just disappeared. Perhaps this means that the pirates are already here. The captain managed to tell me the estimated number of bioraider pirates. Their two thousand units. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Experienced whistled. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Is it a lot? - asked Natalia to Experienced. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- This is a lot. Pirates bioradiators on average outperform our pilots in skill. For a successful defense you need a threefold advantage in numbers. But ... our best pilots are far superior to the best bioradiders. For example, Henri paired with a level strategist ... General Khramtsova or General Katalov can successfully withstand hundreds of bioraider. But nature does not often give such pilots ...</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- We need to urgently announce mobilization! How do I get in touch with the president? - General Katalov asked loudly. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúI‚Äôm contacting the president already,‚Äù Skilled answered with a patter. - Mobilization is carried out by the Minister of Defense on the orders of the supreme commander-in-chief - the president. The Secretary of Defense is standing before you, ladies and gentlemen. Within a few hours, we will be able to raise about nine hundred combat-ready riders with a complete set of strategists. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Are you the Minister of Defense? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Only nine hundred riders? - at the same time asked General Alla Khramtsova and Vladimir Katalov.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Yes, I - Minister of Defense. Spaceport console is the best cabinet for me. Yes, only nine hundred riders, with more than half of the riders located here in the space fleet. Do you know how many times in two thousand years mobilization took place? Never! Given the centuries of peaceful life without war and real external threats, such a number of riders is very good. Moreover, we will have Henri, he alone is worth hundreds of bio-riders. Well, I ... too, on something to be bent. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Experienced quickly began to collect small things from his console and shove in his pockets. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- While I am waiting for a response from the president, could you tell me, dear generals, what did you actually do for the operation? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">General Katalov looked at Alla and answered:</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- The Space Fleet has developed a plan for capturing the absolute super-weapon of pirates. This weapon acts like our anomaly ‚Äî it cuts down all quantum convolution circuits completely, which turns off SupremeAI. We are planning to lure the pirates into an advantageous area of ‚Äã‚Äãspace for us and seize there. A key role in the implementation of this plan belongs to two pilots with two strategists who have piloting skills on ancient riders without SupremeAI. We desperately need Henri, but for some reason he refused to make contact. His condition - he must set a track record. We decided to help him set a record. For this, the Sai - SupremeAI space fleet cruiser, has developed a script that improves the characteristics of the AI ‚Äã‚Äãrider Henri. Our agent infiltrated the record of the race and began downloading the script.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- ... You said you need two pilots. The first is Henri, and who is the other? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- The operation to seize the super-weapons of pirates is very difficult. We need only the best pilots. The first is Henri with me as a strategist. In the second raider, Alla will be the strategist, and Ekaterina Kirik will be the pilot. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Katya?! She is alive? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Yes, at that ill-starred race forty years ago, it did not break. It was a dramatization. Katya was kidnapped by pirates and erased her memory by a neuroprogrammer. However, she was able to recover the memory and escape from the pirates. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- So, the "mad four" is reunited. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Suddenly Experienced rushed out of the control room, continuing to speak quickly:</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- I received an order to start an urgent mobilization from the president! She will contact you now. So, still ... Natalia, Henri just disappeared from the radar, organize a rescue operation! I will manage the situation from my rider! </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Experienced hid in the door control room. Natalia Matveyeva began to organize a rescue operation. And the generals had a silent conversation. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Vova, there is one thing that we need to keep in mind. The detector showed strange confidence response values. It seems that journalists are not entirely sincere, or rather, they think that they are answering the truth, but in fact this is induced information. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- They have something inspired?</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- May be. See one more thing: the operator - modified by 60% of people. And it is known that modified people are less susceptible to the action of the pirates' neuroprogrammer! </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- That is ... </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- That is, it is quite possible that the journalists reported the information that the neuroprogrammer put into them. Thus, no attack by pirates is foreseen. Just someone really wants us to prepare for the intervention of pirates. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúHmm ... how sure are you?‚Äù </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- 50% off. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Natalya interrupted the mental conversation of the generals: </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- General Khramtsova, Ian Fomin wants to contact you.</font></font><br><br>  - Who? <br><br> ‚Äî    , ,           ! <br><br>       ,         ¬´¬ª.        ≈ç,           . <br><br>  UPD. <a href="https://habr.com/post/423231/"></a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/422969/">https://habr.com/ru/post/422969/</a></p>
