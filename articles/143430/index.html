With my little story, I would like to bring one simple thought: dream, do something for the soul. <br><br>  Let it be necessary only for you and no one else, but the main thing is that you get real pleasure from the process, and then you will find your Gray. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I have never read articles on increasing motivation, believing that I do not need it.  Moreover, I always thought that it was difficult to upset me.

      Exactly a year ago, an idea was born in my head.  Inspired by her, I decided to try myself in the field of the developer of my project.  Seven months, without losing hope, I was developing, blindly believing that someone would share my idea with me.  During this time, the spirit of perfectionism settled in me, I tried to think through every detail of my ‚Äúbrainchild‚Äù.  It was one of my problems, talking about one detail could drag on for weeks.  At first this may seem like a very good trait, but unfortunately it is not.  In fact, we (engaged in the development of the two) six months later were tired, lost heart and planned to do nothing else.  The final dialogue was decisive: <br><br>  - Well, you refuse, we will not do anything else? <br>  - I no longer see the point. <br>  - Speak right.  Are you closing? <br>  - I'll be a complete fool if I refuse. <br><br>  Actually my friend was wrong.  Now, though he did not understand, he would be very glad that he refused.  Why all?  The project was completed and released in beta testing.  The link immediately went to all friends.  Silence ... I did not get any good feedback, I was depressed.  ‚ÄúBut you got a lot of experience creating this project,‚Äù said my inner voice.  This is true, but it did not comfort me.  If a small child who ‚Äúpainted‚Äù a drawing says that it‚Äôs terrible, he will never draw again in his life; worse, it can lead to complexes in the future. <br><br>  Without moral support nothing can exist.  I could not accept the idea that nothing had happened, that I had to close everything and no longer tell anyone what I had done in this new project.  The only sensible decision was to take a timeout to calm your emotions and bring thoughts in order. <br><br>  More walks, more communication.  This allowed me to clear my mind of negative thoughts.  On one of these evenings, I got the idea again * the author laughs at himself *.  The point was simple: watch how people spend their days, and share their in four photos (morning, afternoon, evening, night).  It was not something special, rather it was an idea for the soul.  Already wetting my throat, <s>licking my wounds from failure</s> , I began to write.  Whether due to the experience gained, or whether the idea was simple in two weeks, everything was ready.  The reader may have a slight feeling of deja vu, and at that time I sent a link to <a href="http://stickday.com/">Stickday to</a> my friends.  I was extremely surprised, but everyone said only pleasant words to me.  Of course, this could only serve as a consolation, but nobody knew about my feelings. <br><br>  This is the story that happened to me.  Morality here, perhaps not.  But I can say from myself: ‚ÄúDo something for the soul, it is necessary.‚Äù <br><br>  And in conclusion, taking this opportunity, I want to congratulate everyone on Victory Day.  Thanks to our grandfathers and great-grandfathers! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/143430/">https://habr.com/ru/post/143430/</a></p>
