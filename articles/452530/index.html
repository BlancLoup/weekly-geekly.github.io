    <h2>  IT edition </h2><br>  We at Glyph Media (our <a href="https://t.me/glphmedia">Telegram channel</a> ) cooperate with IT companies.  We help where the regular editor-humanist ‚Äúslips‚Äù - we can prepare many regular publications about the structure of IT systems.  For example, it is difficult to imagine an employee who for years makes 10-15 large materials per month on one highly specialized topic.  And we do it. <br><br>  We distribute tasks among several specialists who are already ‚Äúin the subject line‚Äù and can quickly understand how and what works.  We also check each other and look at the presentation of the material so that it is connected with the client's business, liked the audience and did not look like regular market news, press releases, SEO texts or something like that. <br><br>  Frankly, when the work is delayed, there is no power left for its speakers and telegram channels.  We <a href="https://vc.ru/marketing/64572-podkast-o-rabote-it-redakcii-i-kontent-marketinge">started</a> talking about ourselves <a href="https://vc.ru/marketing/64572-podkast-o-rabote-it-redakcii-i-kontent-marketinge">recently</a> , so as not to be a shoemaker without shoes. <br>  Usually we are simply recommended by clients and acquaintances.  That is how we met with Michael, an insurance expert.  We will tell you how we started our cooperation. <br><br><h2>  Insurer </h2><br>  As we found out, Michael was able to communicate with the audience in specialized forums, where they discussed the settlement after the accident and the delay in payments from insurance companies.  Mikhail tried to make recommendations based on the experience of interacting with insurance and explained how to achieve something and not spend all his time on it. <br><br>  Marketing was built on live communication with potential customers.  Even people came to insure cars of his wife, relatives, recommended Michael to friends.  Surprisingly, the site was already a service history.  His role was to give these people the opportunity to choose insurance on the desired topic.  Then he looked like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/2u/a4/au/2ua4aufummowokbh9flkvvyia9k.png"><br><br>  Our task was not so much to offer some unusual site design, but rather to develop customer interaction in the spirit of what Fintech companies do: they give the audience understandable IT services and share relevant information. <br><br><h2>  Site </h2><br>  So, our client's specialization is auto insurance.  The second area is property insurance.  The third is medical risk insurance.  And then a number of different <a href="https://www.ins-team.ru/">types of insurance</a> for individuals and businesses.  He has been doing this for almost 9 years. <br><br>  Michael helps clients to monitor the implementation of all obligations under the insurance contract.  Such support is provided from the first day of work and is now available at no additional cost and almost around the clock. <br><br>  People do not always have the opportunity to get a competent assessment of the situation and a recommendation on how best to act to settle insurance claims, but here the clients receive expert support and, which is valuable, do not remain in debt. <br><br>  As we found out in the course of analyzing the old site, in addition to basic information about the company, Mikhail collected hundreds of customer reviews.  Some of them were duplicated, so we decided to immediately deal with this and distribute <a href="https://www.ins-team.ru/review/">reviews by year</a> . <br><br>  For the sake of interest, we even identified some trends for one of the richest year reviews and wrote about it <a href="https://www.ins-team.ru/news/spasibo">one of the first</a> materials for a corporate blog.  On the chart - keywords (by the number of entries) for the four quarters of the year. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vo/wt/vs/vowtvs4sukbgqpvb1ifc1oa1xnu.png"><br><br>  From the point of view of working on the site, our priorities have been and remain - the speed of making simple changes and administration, plus the low cost of support. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mw/ta/wl/mwtawl4xh9ukd6vw800ddwiqqv0.png"><br><br>  Taking into account these requirements, we used the designer and <a href="https://www.ins-team.ru/">reworked the</a> textual and visual presentation of information in comparison with what was on the old site. <br><br><h2>  Blog </h2><br>  We acted as the external editorial board <a href="https://www.ins-team.ru/blog/">of the insurance team ‚ÄúInsurance Team‚Äù</a> .  For this project, we gradually developed a number of thematic headings: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>" <a href="https://www.ins-team.ru/news/category/%25D0%259D%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D1%258B%25D0%25B5%2B%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2585%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8">New technologies</a> "</b> - assessment of the potential impact of IT innovations on the insurance market and the experience of customer interaction with insurance companies (why <a href="https://www.ins-team.ru/news/telematics">telematics does not work</a> , what <a href="https://www.ins-team.ru/news/pts">electronic PTS</a> will change <a href="https://www.ins-team.ru/news/pts">,</a> why <a href="https://www.ins-team.ru/news/podcast-13">gadgets</a> will not solve interaction problems, how <a href="https://www.ins-team.ru/news/it">IT businesses come to insurance</a> ) </li></ul><br><ul><li>  <b>" <a href="https://www.ins-team.ru/news%3Fcategory%3D%25D0%2597%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%2B%25D0%25B8%2B%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D1%258F%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BA">Law and Order</a> "</b> - not just materials with simple and understandable analyzes of changes in the regulation of the insurance sector, but also practical guidelines designed to help in various situations ( <a href="https://www.ins-team.ru/news/oba">mutual fault in road accidents</a> , <a href="https://www.ins-team.ru/news/many">insurance</a> , <a href="https://www.ins-team.ru/news/naezd">actions when hitting a pedestrian</a> , <a href="https://www.ins-team.ru/news/shema-dtp">scheduling road accidents</a> ) </li></ul><br><ul><li>  <b>‚Äú <a href="https://www.ins-team.ru/news%3Fcategory%3D%25D0%25A3%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5">Management</a> ‚Äù</b> is a rubric aimed at partners and employees of Mikhail, in which he shares his opinion on how to develop a business (there is an <a href="https://www.ins-team.ru/news/startup">analytic based on a sample from the Startups section on vc.ru</a> , a brief <a href="https://www.ins-team.ru/news/history-2">history of auto insurance</a> and a story about how it <a href="https://www.ins-team.ru/news/principles">works insurance agent</a> ) </li></ul><br><ul><li>  <b>‚Äú <a href="https://www.ins-team.ru/news%3Fcategory%3D%25D0%259F%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%2B%25C2%25AB%25D0%25AD%25D0%25BA%25D1%2581%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25C2%25BB">Analytical podcast Expertise</a> ‚Äù</b> - in this program Michael explains what is happening in the insurance market, talks about real situations and his experience in supporting clients in the process of settling insurance claims (we provided all the necessary infrastructure for recording the program - we take care of the audio and release this podcast in the <a href="http://www.vigorousspace.co/expertise">web version</a> and in <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/ekspertiza-vigorous-space/id1126948882%3Fmt%3D2">iTunes</a> ) </li></ul><br><ul><li>  As other subject headings, we identified the following - ‚Äú <a href="https://www.ins-team.ru/news%3Fcategory%3D%25D0%259E%25D0%25A1%25D0%2590%25D0%2593%25D0%259E">CTP</a> ‚Äù, ‚Äú <a href="https://www.ins-team.ru/news%3Fcategory%3D%25D0%259A%25D0%2590%25D0%25A1%25D0%259A%25D0%259E">CASCO</a> ‚Äù, ‚Äú <a href="https://www.ins-team.ru/news%3Fcategory%3D%25D0%25A0%25D1%2583%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0">Guidelines</a> ‚Äù, ‚Äú <a href="https://www.ins-team.ru/news%3Fcategory%3D%25D0%25A0%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%2B%25D1%2581%2B%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8">Work with Clients</a> ‚Äù, ‚Äú <a href="https://www.ins-team.ru/news%3Fcategory%3D%25D0%259C%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5%2B%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2585%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5">Medical Insurance</a> ‚Äù and ‚Äú <a href="https://www.ins-team.ru/news%3Fcategory%3D%25D0%259F%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5">Appendix</a> ‚Äù (we will talk about it later in the relevant subsection of the case) </li></ul><br>  It is worth noting that we did not use any advertising services for the project.  The content was distributed by those readers who already knew Michael, and was used in discussions on thematic forums to refer people to guides and parse real situations. <br><br><blockquote>  Since the release of a number of materials attracted a significant amount of new audience and showed good results.  Some of the most notable: <br><br><ul><li>  " <a href="https://www.ins-team.ru/news/howto">Instruction: how to make out hidden damage after an accident</a> " - 11,441 views </li><li>  " <a href="https://www.ins-team.ru/news/fra">How can you return the amount of the franchise from the perpetrator of the accident</a> " - 5,482 views </li><li>  ‚Äú <a href="https://www.ins-team.ru/news/telematics">Why it doesn‚Äôt work: Telematics and savings on hull insurance</a> ‚Äù - 4,496 views </li><li>  " <a href="https://www.ins-team.ru/news/safe">The action algorithm in case of accident</a> " - 3,138 views </li><li>  ‚Äú <a href="https://www.ins-team.ru/news/dtp">What to do if a traffic police officer did not record all the damage</a> ‚Äù - 2,429 views </li></ul></blockquote><br>  Further we will tell about what other content we did on external platforms. <br><br><h2>  UGC sites </h2><br>  In the early stages of work, we experimented a lot with external sites - we mainly concentrated our efforts on those that allow us to post materials without having to pay for placement and coordinate the content with the editors. <br><br>  We tried to spread the experience of communicating with Michael clients on auto forums and on other platforms, for example <a href="https://thequestion.ru/account/150569/mikhail-mikheev">The Question</a> .  It is worth admitting that on this site we did not see a surge of interest in the topic and a significant increase in site visits, although we gave links to detailed materials in the <a href="https://www.ins-team.ru/blog">journal</a> .  But some of the answers of Michael were noticeable and <a href="https://www.ins-team.ru/5koleso">attracted the attention of thematic media</a> .  For such requests, we helped prepare <a href="https://roscontrol.com/community/article/popravki-v-zakon-ob-osago/">expert columns</a> on behalf of Mikhail and wrote to those media outlets that were more suitable for the development of his business.  For example, they wrote about <a href="https://rb.ru/opinion/api-dlya-insurtech/">API for insurance companies</a> and <a href="https://rb.ru/opinion/strahovka-gadzhet/">insurance of gadgets</a> for Rusbase. <br><br>  If you go back to the UGC-sites, then you can not ignore the side Geektimes.  Here we received <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/insteamru/topics/">very good results</a> and tens of thousands of views of materials, although we did not seek to advertise something directly - we just shared the expertise of Michael. <br><br>  Here is his review of our work: <br><br><blockquote>  From the first day the project was founded, my main task was to become an insurance agent No. 1 in the Russian Federation.  I advised clients on simple specialized topics - there was enough knowledge, and I actively shared information.  But I also observed a situation that I didn‚Äôt like very much: among those who could develop this area, there are a lot of specialists writing articles about you - how good you are, etc.  But this is all very boring and uninteresting. <br><br>  It all started like this: on the recommendation of a client, I found out that there is a guy (his son) who is very keen on music.  I listened to a couple of his tracks.  Well, so-so ... For an amateur.  Further, A.A.  announced that his son is very talented and writes ‚Äúpodcasts‚Äù. <br><br>  For me it was a novelty, and I decided to take contact.  Find out, maybe something and we stir up this.  In general, I fired up this idea.  An additional incentive was that no one in the industry did anything of the kind.  Several years have passed - nothing has changed. <br><br>  We met with Dmitry and Alina (later his wife).  It turned out that there is possible not just a ‚Äúpodcast‚Äù at the exit, but a comprehensive development of a part of the business (structuring the site, maintaining the style and its development, shooting, podcasts, it-solutions, applications, etc.). <br><br>  In short, we sang.  I like that guys do not slow down.  In the truest sense of the word - always try to go further.  Develop.  They know how to listen to customer requests, make the right conclusions.  I sincerely wish creative victories, development to the international level and great family well-being! </blockquote><br><h2>  application </h2><br>  As we said at the beginning of the story, our task was to give the audience simple and relevant information on the topic.  But besides that, we started developing the service component - we started developing a mobile application for clients. <br><br>  For a number of the first public versions, we focused on <a href="https://www.ins-team.ru/app">information services</a> and provided Mikhail's clients with the opportunity to communicate with him in a chat, made a questionnaire for applying for OSAGO, KASKO and other types of insurance, plus - we carried out a number of basic reminders in the format of an action algorithm in an emergency. <br><br>  If we talk about the stack, here we can highlight the following: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Backend</b> .  The development language is Ruby.  The Hanami Framework.  Data Storage - Postgresql.  The database for task queues is Redis (via the Sidekiq library). </li></ul><br><ul><li>  <b>Frontend</b> .  Language - JS.  Framework - React Native.  Data storage - Redux + Redux Persist. </li></ul><br><ul><li>  <b>Miscellaneous</b> .  Chat Backend is an open source solution for RocketChat.  Sending push - library <a href="https://github.com/rpush/rpush">Rpush</a> . </li></ul><br><ul><li>  <b>Continuous Integration</b> - Gitlab CI.  It spills new versions of backend's into the Kubernetes cluster through the built-in Gitlab Auto DevOps.  Kubernetes is deployed on servers in the Russian Federation through Rancher. </li></ul><br>  At the moment, the application does not provide for a closed authorized part.  All sections are available without registration.  Chat is no exception.  Therefore, at this stage it was important for the client that any user could write (the so-called LiveChat). <br><br>  The availability of a ready-made web interface for operators is a good opportunity for a quick start with a small base of active users.  We picked up an open source solution with the prospect of expansion.  Today, most open chat rooms either do not support LiveChat, or do not fit other requirements.
