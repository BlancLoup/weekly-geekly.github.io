  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How I bought the Nokia 5800</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It all started a couple of weeks ago.  My wife's sister has a birthday (after all, a round date at 25 years old) and she asked me to give her an iPhone.  Then we should not forget to clarify that she has been living and working in Egypt for 5 years, where they are also sold, of course, but more expensive than ours. <br><br>  Word for word, but I persuaded her to try the Nokia 5800, especially since he had been officially selling to us for about a week and it was possible to try and twist it.  I read reviews on the Internet, looked for reports of lucky people on LiveJournal and more and more convinced that ‚Äúone must take‚Äù. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  It is Saturday.  This Wednesday we fly to Sharm, so you can no longer pull.  I took my wife as an adviser (she still knows her sister better than me) and went to the nearest M.Video store.  Come - no!  How?  Why?  The sellers (one of which, as it turned out, is not at all from this department) vaguely answer that, they say, Nokia has delivered very few devices, is not enough for everyone.  I ask how much?  Answer - 10, all bought up in 2 days.  Turn around, leave.

      We arrived in Eldorado.  We were met by a huge queue for a washing machine, sold for 3000 rubles.  Barely pushing, we rise to the second floor and immediately to the department with telephones.  No Nokia is here.  I ask, how so?  They answer - they delivered very little, they all sold out for 3 days. <br><br>  They spat and went to IT.  We come - the same cholera as Eldorado, only a side view.  The mobile phone department has 6 salespeople and smiles.  The Nokia 5800 is on the display case. I take it in my hand, look around ... Easy on the iPhone, the screen is smaller and unusually long.  The interface is quite fast, not instant, of course, but tolerable.  The contrast black-and-red theme is comfortable, but on the whole the interface is very confusing and, compared to the iPhone, it loses in terms of both the convenience (intuitiveness) of work and the speed of response.  Accelerometer works like a clock.  While standing, the phone found a Wi-Fi network.  Pofotkal on the camera, flash killing, blinding and the quality of the photos is not very.  The same problems embedded cameras in the phones. <br><br>  I poke my fingers and ask the seller: <br>  - How, nothing such a device? .. <br>  - Very good, - the girl answers, - it is necessary to take. <br>  - I take it.  - I say.  - Wrap it up! <br>  ‚ÄúSell,‚Äù the young lady says, ‚ÄúI will sell him, but you will receive him only after 4 days.‚Äù  At all, not enough. <br><br>  In, I think the hype.  And advertising at least - banners in the subway, banners and lightboxes.  I twist the Nokia 5800 in thought in my hands, I ask the seller again: <br>  - Just bring to the environment? <br>  - Well, the deadline is on Thursday. <br><br>  Here comes another girl seller and whispers first: <br>  - What are you, on Thursday they definitely will not be yet, on Friday say they will come. <br>  ‚ÄúThey‚Äôll be on Friday,‚Äù the first one answered cheerfully. <br>  ‚ÄúNot,‚Äù I say, ‚Äúfor too long.‚Äù  What else is there with similar features? <br>  - iPhone.  Are available.  But I advise you to take Nokia.  iPhone is unreasonably expensive. <br>  - What's wrong with him when compared with Nokia?  - I ask. <br>  ‚ÄúThe camera is worse, there are no flashes ...‚Äù she hesitated, ‚Äú... and more expensive.‚Äù <br>  - Will not exactly bring Nokia to the environment?  - I give myself and the store the last chance. <br>  - They will definitely not bring it.  Maybe look HTC Diamond and Samsung i900? <br><br>  Watching a diamond.  In all articles loses both Nokia and iPhone.  I give back with a lack of understanding, whence the price for it is 21 thousand rubles.  I watch the Samsung i900 politely slipped to me.  17,000 rubles, and it seems like the same set of functions.  I poked my finger into it - I pull back with a sigh. <br><br>  - Let's get an iPhone. <habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/46337/">https://habr.com/ru/post/46337/</a></p>
