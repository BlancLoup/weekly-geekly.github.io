  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How not to drown in the landing: the history of the creation of the Japanese CarPrice</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the last article about the development of CarPrice <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/carprice/blog/341380/">in Japan,</a> we promised to write separately about the creation of a site for the exotic Japanese market.  Absolutely unfamiliar language.  Little time to launch.  Big difference in time between IT and business.  Geographically fragmented team from Russia, Japan, Canada, Belarus, the Philippines and China.  In this post we will tell you how it all turned out in these difficult conditions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/de6/e7d/b72/de6e7db72baf20a489557faf1b36b8d1.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  After the first comparison of the Russian and Japanese markets, it became clear that we will not get off with a simple translation.  And with the ‚Äúsimple translation‚Äù everything was not easy.  Attempts to process the text in the forehead were doomed to failure - here are a few examples of Google translator: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

    <ul><li> ‰πóËªä ÂÆöÂì° is the number of passengers.  Google has a rideable ability <br></li><li> „Éë „Éâ „É´ - steering wheel.  Google has a paddle <br></li><li> „ÉÜ „Éº „É´ „É¨ „É≥ „Ç∫ - stop lamp.  Google has a tail lens <br></li><li> „Éà „É© „É≥ „ÇØ „É´ „Éº „É† - trunk interior.  Google has a back room <br></li></ul><br>  A Japanese who lives in Russia joined our team, but his knowledge of his native language was not enough for accurate translation.  Needed knowledge of terms.  As a result, our first inspector in Japan, Takita-san, helped us a lot.  Thanks to his expertise, we competently localized the first version of the application for inspectors - part of the content most saturated from a professional point of view. <br><br>  Briefly about technology.  The Japanese CarPrice is a fork of the Russian project.  There are several projects on Laravel + vue, Go and two on bitrix: the main project is a monolith and a website with a FAQ (chiebukuro.carprice.co.jp).  The monolithic project consists of two sites: a site for customers and a site for dealers. <br><br><h2>  Client site </h2><br>  Site for those who want to sell their car.  Here, the owners are recorded on the evaluation of cars and auction.  Here is our information and advertising video describing the scheme of work: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rdrAJqV6X2A" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Creating this site, we took into account the Japanese traditions of web design and relied on the fact that in this country are actively used landing pages.  It was planned that this will increase the conversion of two times.  Therefore, further landing will be given increased attention. <br><br>  So, the main element of the main page is a record for a vehicle inspection.  Further - the description of the scheme of work CarPrice.  These are 5 steps: <br><br><ol><li>  Enter information about the car and get an approximate cost. <br></li><li>  Reservation time of the car inspector.  You can choose on the website or through a call center. <br></li><li>  Car Inspection <br></li><li>  15-minute auction for the car interested dealers.  The history of auto auctions in Japan has been around for decades, everything has already been honed and passes quickly. <br></li><li>  Price offer to the client, execution of necessary documents <br></li></ol><br>  In the first desktop version of the site, the recording form was brought up: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gj/j3/qx/gjj3qxi5nfnwltvfa4xpoqf_lte.png"></div><br>  In the first mobile version of the site on the main page of the questionnaire was not, you had to click: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f60/1e4/b54/f601e4b548b75f2f809a8977fea494dd.png"></div><br>  Together with the site were launched landing pages for our first marketing campaigns - less bright, more saturated with information. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/b5/vx/ql/b5vxqldd6jn1yxrv7r-7ybgbat0.png"></div>  <i>The program "Friends" („Éà „É¢ „ÉÄ „ÉÅ).</i>  <i>Bring a friend and get 20,000 yen.</i> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/oh/ca/br/ohcabrrhqg7jjuhz5q30kvdht2k.png"></div>  <i>Come to us („Åî Êù• Â∫ó Âøú Êè¥) program.</i>  <i>Apply until March 31 and receive 1000 yen when you look at the car and another 10,000 yen to the sale price.</i>  <i>Mobile landings here are almost the same as desktop ones - content is mostly text.</i> <br><br>  In the following mobile homepage design, we rendered the form on the first page and reduced the number of steps: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/oe/9n/pr/oe9npr9jmoedwvv5jdaewt-8l7e.png"></div><br>  In the future, we decided to remove most of the descriptions and focused on the recording form.  Now you can immediately fill in your personal data - first name, last name, phone number: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rw/zv/cv/rwzvcvr02xxa4sxm-ijmkkxog_a.png"></div><br>  The mobile version was redone in the same way, but later we made the form for the assessment more compact, and added a picture to the header explaining the benefits of selling a car through CarPrice.  Then the same information migrated to the desktop. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wn/if/jg/wnifjgdi0_xbk_cfs-wgh7nc6ym.png"></div><br>  The profit statement increased conversion by 10%.  In the next version, we hung a simple medal with the number one without any explanations.  Conversion jumped 25%! <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/l6/fh/4e/l6fh4exav12tejzzj7-olwp8o4o.png"></div><br><br>  Then we decided to experiment with landing pages for specific brands: Toyota, Honda, Nissan: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/um/_k/sf/um_ksf3vbtwvrpfu4txldjyenr4.png"></div><br>  Following the results of this period of the site operation, we actively took up mobile landing page.  First, we conducted a redesign of the evaluation form, updated the blocks on the work of CarPrice and customer benefits, as well as a block with comments.  Then they reduced the information blocks, changed the picture in the header.  Then they again returned the information blocks, but shifted the information focus on the steps of selling a car in CarPrice.  And finally - phew!  - Decorated with all the icons.  After some time, a part of these changes also affected the desktop version of the site (in the illustration below, both versions are put side by side). <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/5v/pl/nv/5vplnvh6xzxv85nuynhyiue_o_u.png"></div><br><br>  As a car manufacturer, Japan has a huge export potential.  In Japanese CarPrice, we also decided to adjust the scheme of work for export and made the corresponding landing page in English: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/td/5x/3n/td5x3nqckwy1kpnnynvuqiijeiu.png"></div><br>  With the proliferation of accordion sites, we have accordingly changed the mobile landing page. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zs/qd/3b/zsqd3bvj2sbrhay_umkcovxg-aq.png"></div><br>  We hope you read this far.  It's time to reveal the identity of the girl in the first picture of the post.  This Nastya is the face of our company in Japan.  Nastya is interested in cosplay and twitter in Japanese ( <a href="https://twitter.com/nastyan_cos">https://twitter.com/nastyan_cos</a> ).  At one time, she was able to gather 3.2 million yen ($ 30,000) in crowdfunding to open her own maid caf√© - these are cosplay restaurants in which French-style waitresses behave not like regular waitresses, but as servants in private house.  Photos of Nastya until recently decorated the cap of the Japanese CarPrice. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/3u/c2/iu/3uc2iu8fjo-fjg5fldiyvpedzua.png"></div><br>  The accordion form showed the best conversion, and we decided to leave it.  But instead of Nast, they added more Japanese themes to the header along with screenshots of the client's deshbord.  The most recent major update of the client site was the introduction of adaptive design. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wa/3b/bm/wa3bbmgvfjd84lc54rp0nnyim50.png"></div><br>  Compared to the sites of other Japanese auto auctions, we have less auxiliary content on the first screen.  Given the specifics of the market, we decided to do without unnecessary explanations. <br><br><h2>  Dealer site </h2><br>  This site is intended for those who want to buy a car.  Here is a list of auctions, bid on them.  You can customize the newsletter on the criteria of interest.  This year, big changes are planned in the UX site, which the Japanese design team is currently working on.  Below are screenshots of an application that duplicates the functionality of the dealer site. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vj/rp/zc/vjrpzcwzgqj4tszloymtmldf6so.png"></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bl/xr/zj/blxrzjhkfv7dd2xte25cxa64xjg.png"></div><br><h2>  Partner's Personal Account </h2><br>  In the previous article, we mentioned the multifunctional Japanese gas stations and services where you can inspect and buy cars.  Therefore, our IT platform is used not only by CarPrice employees, but also by partners, for whom we are now creating a personal account.  Attracting new partners is the main goal of our Japanese marketing today. <br><br>  We created a personal partner office together with a consulting firm.  They developed a large base of damage and modifications, algorithms for determining whether the car was in a crash or not.  They also provide application development tips and train inspectors.  With this company we have created our own system for assessing the overall condition of the car, interior and exterior. <br><br>  Among the evaluation parameters - mileage, year of manufacture, history of repair, the presence of noise in the engine, defects.  The inspector records all the damage to the car in the evaluation sheet (Ë©ï ‰æ° „Ç∑ „Éº „Éà). <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/55/jk/7i/55jk7izg_lt2hgcjdwagrpsdeno.png"></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ao/gp/en/aogpengm4arkmynzezukq08rkxo.png"></div><br><br>  For the convenience and simplicity of perception of all defects, we have developed a schematic scan.  The type of damage and degree are marked on the diagram on each damaged part.  Photos are attached here. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dc9/8d5/9c1/dc98d59c1df9892a6f98c447efc80b91.png"><br>  In our scheme, we use the conventional notation for types and sizes of damage in Japan.  For each type of damage has its own gradation of sizes.  For example, for scratches: 1 - with a business card, 2 - with an A4 sheet, 3 - more than an A4 sheet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f4c/0d1/a24/f4c0d1a24c6a6990c91ab4eba17507e8.png"><br><br><h2>  Personal account seller </h2><br>  On filling out the first form, work with car owners is just beginning.  In Japan, we were able to fully translate all interactions into electronic form.  For this was created a personal account of the seller. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/if/fp/qs/iffpqs07qk9u04z9sgly16e5wws.png"></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/de/dl/ai/dedlaih3r3bhvmuof1mxymbenz4.png"></div><br><br>  Through the seller‚Äôs personal account, the client leaves detailed information about himself and his car, and after the auction accepts the price offered or refuses.  If agreed, the seller fills in the rest of the necessary data and leaves an electronic signature.  In Japan, electronic signature is used everywhere and is legally binding, so there are no obstacles to the introduction of fully electronic document management. <br><br>  We do not plan to stop the development of a personal account, client portal and landing pages, but now we have concentrated most of the resources on the dealer site.  By the way, in our Moscow office, a <a href="https://moikrug.ru/vacancies/1000038335">vacancy of a</a> lead testing engineer was opened.  We welcome your resume! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/345074/">https://habr.com/ru/post/345074/</a></p>
