Interview with Dirkjan Bussink</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  There is less than 8 days left until the next <a href="http://railsclub.ru/">RailsClub'Moscow</a> conference.  The most representative company of international Ruby stars in the entire conference history will arrive at the 11th meeting of Russian rubists. <br><br>  We continue to acquaint you with the stellar speakers <a href="http://railsclub.ru/">RailsClub'Moscow</a> .  Today we bring to your attention an interview with <a href="https://github.com/dbussink">Dirkjan Bussink</a> / <a href="https://github.com/dbussink">Dirkjan Bussink</a> - Dutch developer rubinius and datamapper.  This is the third interview of the series, we have previously talked with <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/railsclub/blog/150734">Steve Klabnik</a> and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/railsclub/blog/150737">Xavier Noria</a> . <br><br>  Interviews are published with original answers in English and our free translation :)

      <a href="https://github.com/dbussink">Dirkjan Bussink</a> (Netherlands): rubinius developer and datamapper <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bbb/23d/bc0/bbb23dbc0c317f1b34c897b452656705.jpeg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>How do you imagine Moscow?</b> <br><br>  - I honestly have no idea.  I‚Äôm excited about it.  There is a chance to visit. <br><br>  - Honestly, I have no idea.  I have never been here and this is one of the reasons why I am so happy about the upcoming trip.  This is not the most common tourist destination in the Netherlands, so it's great to get a chance to come here. <br><br>  <b>What would you like to see here?</b> <br><br>  - Hopefully it will be a good combination of meeting people and getting to the city.  Mostly touristy. <br><br>  - I hope I am waiting for a good combination of meetings with people and opportunities to see the city.  Probably, I will behave like an ordinary tourist, but I will also be happy to learn about secret gems that are worth visiting and which only local people know or who are not so popular with tourists. <br><br>  <b>What do you expect from a meeting with Russian developers Ruby?</b> <br><br>  - Nothing specifically for just about everyone.  Hopefully I can also get people interested in what I work on. <br><br>  - In fact, nothing concrete, just hope to meet with great people who are engaged in various interesting things.  I also hope that I can interest them in what I'm working on. <br><br>  <b>What project / open source are you working on?</b> <br><br>  - Working on some new stuff at Nedap which is still pretty experimental, of course. <br><br>  - I am working on some new projects for Nedap, which are still quite experimental, and, of course, I am working on Rubinius, according to which the majority know me. <br><br>  <b>What do you consider your main achievement in life or career?</b> <br><br>  - Hopefully I haven't been satisfied that yet.  I am trying to make it. <br><br>  ‚ÄúI hope I haven't done it yet.‚Äù  I try to live by the principle: it is better to regret what I did, than about what I did not, and I hope that I will do a lot more in my life. <br><br>  <b>What do you like to do in your free time from Ruby?</b> <br><br>  - I like the power and has it.  I have to write a letter. <br><br>  - I like the elegance and simplicity of the language and the expressive power it possesses.  I don‚Äôt need to go all the time to write template code to appease the programming god, I can concentrate more on the problem I‚Äôm solving. <br><br>  <b>What would you like to achieve in your profession?</b> <br><br>  I worked on what I worked on.  It is your work. <br><br>  ‚ÄúI hope to be able to leave a significant mark so that others can enjoy what I have been working on and use it.‚Äù  The point is not so much in recognition, as in the knowledge that people enjoy my work with pleasure, it just works and helps them solve their problems. <br><br>  <b>When and why did you start programming?</b> <br><br>  - I wasn't even the one when I started programming.  I think I was already around 14 or 15 years old.  Basically I got bored.  Up to date, I usually preferring to create something more consuming with stuff like gaming. <br><br>  - I started programming not at a very early age.  I think I was already 14 or 15. At first I just got bored being just a user, and a friend told me something.  Until now, I prefer to create something by programming, instead of just consuming, for example, in games. <br><br>  <b>What would you like to become if you didn't become a programmer?</b> <br><br>  - I actually doubted for a while between computer science and physics.  I am still in the middle of the world of quantum mechanics. <br><br>  - Actually, I hesitated for a while between studying computer science and physics.  I still read materials in physics and I love to learn something new about the theory of relativity or the complex properties of quantum mechanics. <br><br>  <b>What book would you recommend to read to any programmer?</b> <br><br>  - Crossing the chasm or The Drunkards walk.  It is not true that it can be used in this world.  The Art of Deception is also pretty interesting.  It doesn‚Äôt include the technical aspects of hacking.  I think I really want to read it. <br><br>  As you might have noticed, these aren't really technical programming books.  I think it's a programmer.  It shouldn‚Äôt be neglected.  It is basically useless.  Developers should not be hired. <br><br>  ‚ÄúOne of the most interesting books I've read is‚Äú Selling the wheel ‚Äù,‚Äú Crossing the chasm ‚Äùand‚Äú The Drunkards walk ‚Äù.  These books are not about programming, but they cover topics such as selling high-tech products or the impact of chaos on the world.  If you are interested in such things as safety, the book ‚ÄúThe Art of Deception‚Äù may seem quite interesting.  It has no technical details, much more social aspects of hacking.  ‚ÄúThinking, fast and slow‚Äù is another book that I definitely want to read myself, it is highly recommended. <br><br>  As you can see, all these books are not entirely technical programmer publications.  I think it's important for a developer to be more than just a programmer.  To make successful products, it is important to understand how people think and behave, so do not lose sight of this.  If you come up with the most elegant program, but no one will use it or will use and suffer - it is pointless.  Developers need to understand this as best they can in order to write programs that really help people and not create obstacles for them. <br><br>  <b>Russia has strong literary traditions.</b>  <b>Have you read any of the Russian writers?</b> <br><br>  - I think I‚Äôve been reading something for everyone.  The storyline of Crime and Punishment sounds somewhat familiar.  I really do sometimes listen to Russian composers such as Tchaikovsky or Rachmaninov. <br><br>  - It seems that at some point I read something from Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoevsky, but, honestly, I am not sure.  At the very least, ‚ÄúCrime and Punishment‚Äù sounds familiar.  In fact, sometimes, when I have a mood, I listen to Russian composers, such as Tchaikovsky or Rachmaninov. <br><br>  <b>Our sponsors</b> <br><br>  We remind that the general sponsor of our conference was the company <a href="http://undev.ru/">undev.ru</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8e4/bc8/536/8e4bc85362c29e29b879248da2aeb028.png"><br><br>  UnDev is a unique company that develops large and complex projects.
