    <ol><li>  The analogues available in the warehouses were not taken into account in the procurement process, because there was no information on the fact that they were analogues in the enterprise. </li><li>  Replacing the original with an analogue during the purchase each time was agreed upon by the company's technical specialists, since the information about the analogs, as a rule, was not stored in the System. </li><li>  Accounting for purchased analogs led to numerous additional approvals for adding a new part or equipment to the Nomenclature reference book. </li></ol><br>  Not surprisingly, this brought enormous losses to production.  There was an accumulation of unclaimed stocks in warehouses, qualified specialists performed the same work several times, the process of coordinating the new items of the directory was delayed, slowing down the procurement campaign. <br><br>  For example, only a simple unit of key equipment due to the impossibility of a quick replacement of a part or the selection of an analogue in the company's warehouses resulted in losses of 2-3 million rubles per day! <br><br><h2>  Project Objectives </h2><br>  Based on the problems of the Customer, we have set ourselves three important tasks: <br><br><ol><li>  Make it so that the Customer knows about the counterparts stored in his warehouses or available for purchase. </li><li>  Reduce the time for the selection of nomenclature analogues, and therefore - to automate the process of their selection. </li><li>  Eliminate unnecessary approval procedures for the selection of analogues. </li></ol><br>  Of course, for this it was necessary to study and systematize the <a href="https://habr.com/post/421047/">existing practices of maintaining analogues</a> , as well as the specifics of the customer's nomenclature and business processes. <br><br>  As a result, at this stage, we have developed our approach to automating the maintenance of direct analogs of catalog numbers and tested it on 10% of the Customer‚Äôs nomenclature data to assess the possibility of applying this approach in the remaining part of the Nomenclature. <br><br><h2>  How do we automate the maintenance of direct analogs? </h2><br>  For the automatic maintenance of direct analogues, we have created special technical reference books - a knowledge base, the direct analogues for which are selected without the participation of technical specialists. <br><br><ul><li>  <b>The first of these is the ‚Äúreplacement matrix‚Äù</b> </li></ul><br>  This is a table in which catalog numbers of originals and possible analogues are stored in pairs: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bw/55/oi/bw55oihdnip1vjqi3axouq_tryi.jpeg"><br><br>  Actualization of the ‚Äúoriginal - direct analogue‚Äù relationship in the ‚ÄúNomenclature‚Äù directory is automatically performed according to the routine task like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nk/rn/3v/nkrn3v2p9m41bzi8fpzmbtz2sjq.jpeg"><br><br>  If during routine tasks in the ‚ÄúReplacement matrix‚Äù directory there is the number of the original position, which is absent in the ‚ÄúNomenclature‚Äù directory, an application for creating a new record for the original spare part is automatically created in the Master Data System with reference to the equivalent. <br><br>  Information about the analogue in the directory "Replacement Matrix" is updated by responsible specialists and is downloaded only from official sources. <br><br><ul><li>  <b>The second of them - "Technical Catalog"</b> </li></ul><br>  This is a knowledge base for storing information about all catalog numbers of spare parts included in a particular equipment with decoding.  It is based on data from official sources. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0d/nj/qp/0dnjqpvg_prjldp91idjt5-wxxq.jpeg"><br><br>  Such a reference book is needed to automatically check the correctness of the catalog number of the position, the manufacturer, linking the catalog number to a specific equipment and a possible update of the ‚ÄúReplacement Matrix‚Äù. <br><br><h2>  How does the selection of analogues now look like? </h2><br>  After the introduction of the ‚ÄúSubstitution Matrix‚Äù and the ‚ÄúTechnical Catalog‚Äù, the company started the process of selecting taxes. <br><br>  Now the search and selection of direct analogues using these directories occur automatically when you make each application for the purchase of parts or equipment like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/x_/rr/fm/x_rrfm7m5rcwviapl0hzd4iiuce.jpeg"><br><br>  This order of selection of analogues allows you to: <br><br><ul><li>  to completely exclude the possibility of purchasing similar goods that are in the company's warehouses, even at the stage of filing an application for purchase; </li><li>  to save the Customer‚Äôs money on the purchase of parts or equipment due to the availability of up-to-date official information on less expensive counterparts; </li><li>  improve the parts procurement process due to: <br>  - storing information about the analogue in the description of the parts; <br>  - automation of the creation of current positions - analogues in the reference "Nomenclature" </li></ul><br>  Thus, the benefit in managing analogs is in saving an enterprise‚Äôs money with: <br><br><ul><li>  centralized purchasing companies; </li><li>  one-time purchases in the conditions of emergency repairs due to the stocks of analogues available in warehouses. </li></ul><br><h2>  What specific benefits did the customer get? </h2><br>  According to the Customer‚Äôs estimates, the effect only on the automatic selection of direct analogs, based on the stored communication of catalog numbers, accounted for more than 50% of the total balance in the company's warehouses. <br><br>  And this is what made up the income and expenses of the Customer: <br><br>  <b>The customer spent X rubles for:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  contractor services; </li><li>  completion of existing information systems; </li><li>  content of your own project office. </li></ul><br>  <b>The customer received just such a profit (from applying the approach to 10% of the pilot spare parts list):</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ky/cl/fo/kyclfoy9rvlklwx6kea7fj6j5am.jpeg"><br><br>  Before the start of the project, the company's warehouses kept the remnants of original equipment and spare parts for the amount of 3X rubles.  According to the results of the application of this approach, the total in the company's warehouses were found analogues, which were previously unknown, in the amount of 5X rubles.  It is not difficult to calculate that the Customer will save 2x rubles in the next purchasing company. <br><br>  <b>In general, the Customer is happy, and we are not less, because, as it turned out, the benefit obtained from the correct use of analogues, far exceeds the costs.</b>  <b>And this is only from automating the maintenance of direct analogs for links of catalog numbers!</b> <b><br><br></b>  <b>So then we (and, I hope, you have!) Still have a wide field of activity.</b>  <b>There is no limit to perfection - and the area of ‚Äã‚Äãreference is not an exception.</b>  <b>Solve production problems, use different approaches, and I hope our experience will be useful for you in this.</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/423261/">https://habr.com/ru/post/423261/</a></p>
