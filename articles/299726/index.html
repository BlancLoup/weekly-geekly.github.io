      But, I think we all know - it's not just that. <br><br>  In fact, if you think about these issues more deeply, you will understand that talent and intelligence do not play such a big role as it seems from the beginning.  Research results show that we owe the mind only 30% of achievements - that is, the mind is only the tip of the iceberg. <br><br>  <u>But what is more important than mind and talent?</u>  <u>Answer: spiritual strength.</u> <br><br>  It turns out that spiritual perseverance, also called ‚Äúwillpower,‚Äù plays a far greater than any other quality, role in achieving goals related to health, career, study, business and life in general. <br><br>  And this is great news, because, for example, you cannot do anything with your genes inherited from your parents, and spiritual endurance is more than realistic to develop. <br><br>  Why is spiritual perseverance so important?  And how to develop it in yourself? <br><br>  Let's talk about this in more detail. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">Spiritual Resistance and the US Army</font> </h3><br>  Each year, approximately 1,300 cadets enter the first course of the West Point Military Academy.  On the first summer on campus, cadets must pass a series of tests, incredibly difficult physically and morally.  This summer initiation program at the academy is called <b>"atrocious barracks</b> . <b>"</b> <br><br>  According to the researchers who observed the West Point Cadets, the "atrocious barracks" is a deliberate, deliberate test of the limits of the Cadets' capabilities, their physical, emotional and spiritual endurance.  FBI agents pass the same thing, their <a href="http://testutor.ru/blog/pyat-sekretov-vospitaniya-sily-voli-ot-agenta-fbr/">willpower is also up to par</a> . <br><br>  Perhaps you imagine that the Cadets, who successfully coped with the "brutal barracks", are larger, stronger, or at least smarter than their comrades.  But Angela Duckworth, a researcher from the University of Pennsylvania, watching the cadets, found something completely different. <br><br>  Dakworth explored the achievements of the Cadets, or rather, how spiritual endurance, perseverance and enthusiasm affect the ability to achieve goals.  At West Point, she watched <b>2,441 cadets</b> in the first two courses. <br><br>  She recorded their success at school, the results of entrance tests, the assessment of their leadership potential (reflecting their activity in extracurricular activities), the results of physical fitness tests (a standardized test consisting of physical exercises), as well as their assessment on a scale of will power (measures perseverance). and enthusiasm for achieving long-term goals). <br><br>  And that's what she found out ... <br><br>  Not strength, not mind, and not leadership potential were decisive in whether the cadet would complete the test with ‚Äúatrocious barracks‚Äù successfully.  Willpower played a decisive role in this - perseverance and the desire to achieve long-term goals. <br><br>  In fact, cadets who received 60 or more points on a scale of willpower, more often than others, successfully stood the test of "atrocious barracks."  It was the strength of the spirit that determined the success of the Cadets, and not their talent, intelligence or heredity. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">What is the strength of the spirit?</font> </h3><br>  The Duckworth study has shown the importance of fortitude in many areas. <br><br>  In addition to the results of the above research at West Point, she also found that ... <br><ul><li>  Students of the Ivy League, who differ from comrades by greater willpower, get better grades for individual performance indicators, even if their grades for exams are lower, that is, if they are ‚Äúdumber‚Äù. </li><li>  When comparing two people of the same age, but with different levels of education, it is the will power (and not the intellect) that determines whose education will be better in the end. </li><li>  Participants in the National Spelling Bee spelling competition show the best results not because of their IQ, but because of their strength of will and regular training. </li></ul><br>  Strength of will and spirit is important not only in education.  She is important in anything, and Dakworth and her colleagues proved this by interviewing leaders in all areas: <br><blockquote>  Our hypothesis, consisting in the fact that willpower is important for high achievements in any sphere, was proved in the course of numerous interviews with professionals in the field of investment banking services, painting and art, journalism, science, medicine and law.  In answering the question, what quality distinguishes the best specialists in their fields, all these people mentioned willpower as often as talent.  In fact, many of them were delighted with the achievements of their colleagues, who at first glance did not seem as talented as others, but whose unfailing loyalty to their ambitions was exceptional.  In addition, many were surprised to notice that their incredibly gifted peers did not reach the top in their field. </blockquote>  . <br>  - Angela Duckworth <br><br>  You, probably, more than once were convinced of the veracity of this on your own experience. <br><br>  Remember your friend who lost his talent? <br><br>  How about your employee who squeezed the most out of his potential? <br><br>  Do you know someone who continues to stubbornly go towards a goal, no matter how long it takes? <br><br>  Here <sup><a href="http://www.sas.upenn.edu/~duckwort/images/Grit%2520JPSP.pdf">‚òÖ</a></sup> you can read the full text of the study, but the main thing is what it comes down to: <br><blockquote>  In every area of ‚Äã‚Äãlife ‚Äî in education, work, and health ‚Äî willpower, spiritual endurance, and perseverance affect your success more than any other factor. </blockquote><br>  In other words, talent is too overestimated. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">What makes spiritual endurance?</font> </h3><br>  Reasoning about spiritual fortitude, willpower and perseverance is great.  But what are these qualities in the real world? <br>  Roughly speaking, stamina and willpower come down to endurance. <br><br>  <b>Strong-minded athletes</b> have more exposure than others.  They do not miss workouts.  They do not postpone their tasks.  They never fail teammates. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://testutor.ru/blog/9-kommunikativnyx-navykov-kotorymi-dolzhen-obladat-lyuboj-uspeshnyj-lider/">Strong-minded leaders are</a></b> more restrained than their comrades.  They have a clear goal to which they go every day.  They do not allow short-term gain, negative feedback or a tight schedule to become an obstacle on their way to the realization of the goal.  They organize people around - not just once, but again and again. <br><br>  <b>Strong-minded artists, writers, and other creative people</b> work with greater regularity than most.  They work regularly, according to a schedule, and not only when they feel a rush of inspiration.  They approach work like real professionals, not like amateurs.  They invariably do the most important thing in the first place and do not try to evade responsibility. <br><br>  The good news is that willpower and perseverance can be made defining you, regardless of your innate talents.  You can become more restrained.  You can develop an incredible level of spiritual stamina. <br>  But how? <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Based on experience, there are 3 perfectly working strategies ...</font> </h2><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">1. Determine how spiritual endurance is expressed to you.</font> </h3><br>  For West Point cadets, spiritual endurance is a successfully passed summer of "atrocious barracks." <br><br>  And for you, it may mean ... <br><ul><li>  To endure a month, without missing a single workout. </li><li>  To sustain a week without eating processed or factory-made food. </li><li>  Two days in a row to perform their work tasks to the deadline. </li><li>  A week to meditate every morning. </li><li>  Perform one additional repetition in each set of exercises in the gym. </li><li>  Every Sunday in the same month to meet with friends. </li><li>  During the week, spend one hour on creativity. </li></ul><br>  No matter how you define spiritual strength for yourself, make it clear what it will give you, what you can achieve with it.  Spiritual resilience is an abstract concept, but in the real world it is tied to concrete actions.  You cannot gain strength of mind by magic, you can only develop and confirm it with real actions. <br><br>  This follows the second point ... <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">2. Spiritual endurance is created by small real victories.</font> </h3><br><blockquote>  You cannot become steadfast and purposeful if you are weak in spirit.  How many workouts have you missed due to the fact that not your body, but your mind told you that you are tired?  How many repetitions of exercises you did not do because your mind told you: ‚ÄúNine repetitions are enough.  Tenth to nothing?  Most people, including me, are thousands.  And in 99% of cases the cause was weakness of the body, not of the spirit. </blockquote><br>  - Drew Shamrock <br><br>  We often think that the essence of spiritual perseverance lies in how we react to extreme situations.  How well did you play at the championship?  Can you cope with the loss of one of your family members?  Can you get back to business right away if your business goes bankrupt? <br><br>  Undoubtedly, extreme situations test us for courage, perseverance and spiritual endurance ... But what about everyday circumstances? <br><br>  Spiritual stability is like a muscle.  She needs to be trained so that she grows and develops.  If you cannot overcome yourself even in small things, then when it becomes really difficult for you, you will be weak and not ready to deal with dignity with dignity. <br>  But it should not be so. <br><br>  Do ten repetitions of the exercise when it seems to you that it is easier to do only nine.  Create new instead of consuming.  Ask additional questions, even when it is easier for you to just silently accept what you are told.  Prove yourself with a thousand trifles that you have enough courage to deal with everyday difficulties every day. <br><br>  Spiritual endurance is built in small victories.  It is created by the daily right choice, developing our "muscle of the spirit".  We all want to be strong in spirit, but only by making efforts can you develop this power in yourself.  Only real actions, not words and thoughts build spiritual endurance. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">3. Spiritual resilience is about right habits, not about motivation.</font> </h3><br>  Motivation is not constant.  Willpower stays with you always. <br><br>  The essence of spiritual strength is not in incredible inspiration or courage.  Its essence is in the development of everyday habits, allowing you to keep to a schedule and overcome difficulties again and again, without being distracted by trifles. <br><br>  It is not necessary for spiritually resistant people to be bolder, more talented or smarter than others - but they need to be more patient.  Spiritually resistant people develop a daily system that helps them focus on the important, regardless of the number of obstacles and difficulties that life puts in their way.  It is habits that form the basis of spiritual beliefs and help us reach the heights. <br><br>  Here are the basic steps that will help develop a new habit: <br>  1. Start by creating your identity. <br>  2. Focus on the small in your behavior, and not on serious dramatic transformations that radically change life. <br>  3. <a href="http://testutor.ru/blog/kak-izlechitsya-ot-bolezni-otkladyvaniya-na-potom-pri-izuchenii-yazykov-ili-prokrastinacii-boj/">Develop the ability to constantly do what you need</a> , regardless of the level of motivation that you feel. <br>  4. Always keep to your schedule and don‚Äôt worry too much about the results. <br>  5. If you fail, get back on your feet as soon as possible. <br><br>  Spiritual endurance comes down to habits, even the smallest.  It implies that you constantly do what you have to do, and that you daily practice what is necessary to achieve a goal and keep to a schedule. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">How did you develop spiritual strength?</font> </h3><br>  The mission of man in society is clear: we all want to live a full, happy and healthy life and do something important for society and the world as a whole, changing it for the better. <br><br>  Regardless of what strategies we build, regardless of what goals we set for ourselves, how we see ourselves and the people around ... Nothing can become a reality without spiritual perseverance, perseverance and willpower. <br><br>  When it gets too hard, most people are looking for something simpler to switch to.  But when it becomes too hard for a spiritually steadfast person, he finds a way to cope with all the difficulties. <br><br>  In life, there are extreme situations that require incredible courage, resilience and fortitude ... But for 95% of the circumstances, spiritual endurance comes down simply to being more enduring than most people. <br><br>  PS We recommend another useful article on the topic of working on yourself - <a href="http://testutor.ru/blog/kak-nauchitsya-sebya-kontrolirovat-i-nachat-zhit-toj-zhiznyu-o-kotoroj-vy-mechtaete/">How to learn to control yourself and start living the life you dream about</a> . <br><br>  The author of the translation is Vyacheslav Davidenko, the founder of the <a href="http://testutor.ru/">TESTutor</a> company. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299726/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299726/</a></p>
