Of course, scientists and just engineers are trying to create panels that are resistant to damage, but so far these attempts have not brought much success.  However, the other day, scientists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology showed solar cells that can recover themselves.  The size of such solar cells is very small, not more than a few nanometers.  However, with such dimensions, these elements can support their work themselves, recovering in case of damage.  In this case, the production of solar energy is about the same level. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  According to scientists, the panels are able to find the necessary elements for themselves using proteins, carbon tubes and some other materials.  The result is a device with a very long service life.  Today, the efficiency of solar cells over time is constantly falling, because sunlight, together with air molecules, has a destructive effect on solar panels.  Scientists say that the ‚Äúaging‚Äù of panels can be compared to the process of yellowing paper, which is constantly lying in the open air.  As a result, the conversion rate of solar energy into electrical energy constantly decreases with time, and in the end, the panel simply has to be thrown away.

      However, scientists are paying the most attention to the capacity of batteries and the efficiency of their work, not really thinking about how much the solar panel created by them can last.  But scientists from the above Massachusetts Institute of Technology have begun work on enhancing the reliability of the battery design.  They created a certain nanostructure, whose work is based on the process of photosynthesis.  So far, the size of solar cells manufactured by scientists is very small, but it all starts with a small truth?  The solar cell, created by scientists, is a synthetic mass in which the synthetic "metabolism" reaction takes place, in which the material of the skeleton of elements, carbon nanotubes, is also involved.  In addition, the composition of such an element includes surfactants (surface-active substances), which break some types of compounds. <br><br>  In general, scientists have created a synthetic autonomous structure that works independently, restoring itself (as mentioned, all this is on the scale of the microworld, literally several nanometers).  Of course, it will take a long time until self-healing solar panels appear, but progress is progressing, right?  Perhaps in 5-10 years we will get the desired solar panels, which can last a very long time. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/103835/">https://habr.com/ru/post/103835/</a></p>
