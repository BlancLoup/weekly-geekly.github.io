  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What awaits IntelliJ IDEA ahead?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Very soon our flagship development environment IntelliJ IDEA will be 14 years old.  Many products have already been created using our tools, and seemingly all sorts of features have been added to the IDE, but we continue to look for new sources of inspiration so that our products are always fresh on your table.  On the occasion of the upcoming anniversary, we would like to share our views on what exactly the next 5-10 years will determine development in product development. <br><br>  In order for us to continue the successful development of a rapidly growing company, we decided to turn to independent professional consultants.  The choice fell on a very prestigious international bureau with extensive experience of cooperation and own projects for many well-known IT companies.  A lot of developers of various ages, sexes, with diverse cultural and professional interests were interviewed.  Armed with the main results, our developers with great enthusiasm began to introduce new ideas. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  We continue ‚Äúto program with pleasure!‚Äù </h4><br>  Ambiguous opinions about our unchanging slogan ‚ÄúProgram with pleasure‚Äù (eng. ‚ÄúDevelop with pleasure!‚Äù), Sometimes hinting at an intimate connotation in its meaning, were strongly rejected and completely rejected.  The study showed that most of our users love to program it with pleasure, so we decided not to touch the slogan.

    <br><h4>  New light version with in-app purchases </h4><br>  What we have already encountered in the past have been little, about which our users have written so much on Habr√©, finally passed through comprehension and resulted in the following concept: <br><br>  <b>IntelliJ IDEA needs a new version</b> .  Yes, two versions for such a product - this is unreasonably small.  For those whose choice was decided by throwing a coin, difficult times will come very soon.  Starting with the next version, we are introducing a new edition of IntelliJ IDEA (and then other products of the IntelliJ family) - <b>IntelliJ IDEA Lite</b> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9c3/2e7/db2/9c32e7db256deadba112cd4abda0321d.jpg"><br><br>  One of the key features of this version will be in-app purchases (in-app purchases).  All ingenious is simple, and you will definitely like this innovation.  In-app purchases are something that we all, and even our children, use in everyday life, so the introduction of this feature into our products has become a natural process. <br><br><h5>  Feature credits </h5><br>  It's very simple, friends.  When you use our IDE or other tools from JetBrains, you earn a special virtual currency, JetBrains Feature Credits (JFC).  The more efficiently you use our IDE and the better you know it, the more JFC you earn.  Now, in order to get access to premium features, such as accelerated code indexing, advanced code analysis, fully automated refactoring, new color schemes or even promoting your build on a build server (out of turn), you need to spend more JFC.  You can also exchange real money for JFC directly from your IDE. <br><br>  For those who wish to be prepared for the new version of IntelliJ IDEA, in order to immediately receive more JFC, we have made several recommendations: <br><br><ol><li>  <b>Keep track of your productivity</b> , avoid unnecessary mouse movements and unreasonable clicks on the backspace. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/324/9a1/2e4/3249a12e414ed0d50be6017cfbf19093.png" align="right"></li><li>  Learn the <b>IDE Productivity Guide</b> .  Open it through the Help menu, track your statistics and what other effective development skills you need to pump. </li><li>  <a href="http://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7243%3Fpr%3Didea">Download the</a> <b>IntelliJ IDEA Golf Golf plugin</b> to test your IDE features and learn new ones. </li><li>  <b>IDE keymaps</b> .  Open the Help tab, view and print the keymap, repeat the key combinations before going to bed, learn, put hints on the keyboard. </li></ol><br><br>  Another important news: we are also going to support third-party plug-ins for in-app purchases. <br><br><br><h5>  Game API </h5><br>  What else besides the development brings us real pleasure?  Of course, computer games.  We all play computer games regardless of age, gender, and IDE color scheme.  Games not only allow you to pass the time, but also develop our mind and help to solve more complex tasks. <br><br>  Right now we are developing a new IntelliJ Game SDK, which will simplify the development and implementation of games in the IDE based on the IntelliJ platform. <br><br>  The new <b><a href="http://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IDEADEV/IDEA%2B13.1%2BEAP">EAP build</a> IntelliJ IDEA</b> has already got two games that you can run to take a break or take a break from work.  And then come back with fresh ideas back. <br><br><ol><li>  A timeless game of all time <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digger_(video_game)">Digger</a> .  Just open the menu for creating a new file and start playing the good old digger (Ultimate only). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/898/22e/20b/89822e20bc16bd21d737510ec68f1455.png" alt="image"><br><br></li><li>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2048_(video_game)">2048</a> .  The game, which gave us a 19-year-old Italian web developer Gabrielle Cirulli, which already undermines the performance of many people with Internet access, which delayed the release of this article for several hours. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5d2/72c/af6/5d272caf61f2c95f28621a5747eb63f3.png" alt="image"><br><br></li></ol><br><br><h5>  Personalized IDE </h5><br>  All developers are not alike.  You have your own favorite color scheme, your own keyboard layout, your own window layout.  Do you want that on any computer at home, and at work, and with colleagues, you can run the IDE with the usual settings for you?  We, too.  Therefore, we decided to create online profiles for our users that will store all the important information and allow you to personalize your IDE at any time.  You can also compare your IDE and other achievements with other users. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7d9/6b1/197/7d96b1197cd97e82ca9cc7b18b906ff0.png" alt="image"><br><br><br><h4>  Numerology </h4><br>  We decided to examine in more detail the issue <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/JetBrains/blog/216667/">that</a> our users had indicated earlier, and found out that the ambiguous attitude towards the number 13 actually causes some users to avoid the latest version of IntelliJ IDEA.  As a result of the last meeting of our marketing department, expanded by consultants in numerology, we finally decided, starting today, to rename IntelliJ IDEA 13 to IntelliJ IDEA 14-1.  Therefore, the <a href="http://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IDEADEV/IDEA%2B13.1%2BEAP">new</a> EAP build has an updated number. <br><br>  We have presented only a part of the coming changes.  In the next post we are going to talk in more detail about new features that you will surely like. <br><br>  Stay in touch and continue to program with pleasure! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/217877/">https://habr.com/ru/post/217877/</a></p>
