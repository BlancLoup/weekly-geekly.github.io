If you want to become an important boss or a curvaceous beauty (or both), then imagine that the goal has been achieved.  How did you then look like, what to feel, how to move and talk?  This is the visualization process. <br><br>  Of course, as a cutlet, do not visualize, it will not appear before you on a plate.  You need to raise your lazy ass, screw the stuffing, make this very meatball and fry it.  So with any purpose.  Though fantasized, and the chair of the chief or possession of spoken Spanish will require some effort.  So maybe, well, her, this visualization?  Why is it even needed if I'm still going to go to my dream?

      In my skeptical view, the secret of visualization is precisely in inspiration.  On the way to the goal, whether moving to Goa or learning a programming language, there will be difficulties.  But it is visualization that will become an additional stimulus, motivation, if you suddenly give up.  Sometimes we just lack simple inspiration! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f23/060/24c/f2306024c8d04015ba7caa874c52240a.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Ways to visualize the goal</b> <br><br>  Studying this topic, I was wading through endless meditative practices, drawing my mental desires on a mental screen, simoron techniques, and other methods of ‚Äúcreative‚Äù visualization.  Let's leave these methods for the enlightened and talk about more ‚Äúmundane‚Äù ways. <br><br>  <b><u>Photo</u></b> <br><br>  The idea is as follows - on the central wall or the working board, place pictures that reflect your goal.  It could be anything: moving to Thailand, a new place of work, 1000 followers on Instagram.  Photos can be made specifically for your purpose or shared.  As my practice shows, the first option works more efficiently.  The goal becomes more achievable, personally and emotionally colored.  Once I read this thought: the more a person invests in something, the harder it is for him to part with it.  In general, I believe, right.  If the goal is defined correctly and the steps to achieve it are performed regularly, then you will not leave it halfway. <br>  You can, of course, resort to using Photoshop to put yourself in the director‚Äôs chair, this is personally at your discretion.  But specifically for me, the maximum of naturalness is the best option. <br><br>  <b><u>Profile on the site</u></b> <br><br>  If you do not want to mess with markers and cork, then create your profile, for example, on <a href="https://smartprogress.do/">SmartProgress</a> , and place your goal there.  You can upload several photos, write detailed action plans and generally behave quite freely on the resource.  The main thing is that, going into your profile, you should see your goal in photos, plans, quotes. <br><br> <a href="https://smartprogress.do/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d4d/4c2/ee3/d4d4c2ee30bb4d119da5af05fbc32e01.jpg"></a> <br><br>  <b><u>Mental sculpture</u></b> <br><br>  I read this technique in the book ‚ÄúStep by Step towards Achievement.  Kaizen Method.  Its essence is as follows: you imagine a certain action down to the smallest detail: smell, color, taste, emotions, movements - everything plays its own important role. <br><br>  The author of the book describes how an Olympic medalist, spear thrower, Steve Buckley, trained on the couch after getting injured.  He presented himself at the stadium in the midst of performances at competitions.  ‚ÄúImagine a spear in your hand, feel the dirt stuck to the soles, feel the shouts of the spectators in the stands and see the blue sky above your head.  But mental sculpture required Buckley to include other sensations, to feel how the muscles tighten, how the skin tightens in response to every small movement that causes a perfect throw.  He heard the flying spear ringing, the results were announced, he could smell the grass.  Buckley again and again mentally scrolled his speech.  When the ankle healed and the athlete was able to resume training at the stadium, he was surprised to find that he could continue them exactly from the level at which the injury interrupted him.  ‚ÄúI was able to easily resume my workouts without losing a single day,‚Äù says Buckley.  He has not lost neither professionalism nor strength! ‚Äù <br>  When the forces leave you, and the goal seems unattainable - be inspired using your imagination and imaginative thinking. <br><br>  <b><u>Compiling mind cards</u></b> <br><br>  This is a visual process of <a href="https://smartprogress.do/">achieving the goal</a> .  It visualizes both the goal itself and the path to it: tasks, intermediate results.  This flowchart helps streamline thoughts and actions. <br><br>  Some secrets of making mind cards: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ the main idea is always in the center.  It can be replaced by the goal to which you are going. <br>  ‚Ä¢ usually information is read clockwise from the top right corner.  If you make changes, mark the order with numbers. <br>  ‚Ä¢ play with color.  Take for yourself certain designations (red - risk, green - possibilities) and paint some segments of the path so that the brain perceives information faster. <br>  ‚Ä¢ draw.  We think in images, so a funny picture is preferable and more interesting than 3-5 sentences. <br>  ‚Ä¢ use keywords.  This not only saves time, but also trains the brain. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/41b/e1b/028/41be1b0285744ce8a32c14304f5bc73a.png"><br><br>  <b><u>The calendar</u></b> <br><br>  One woman, let's call her Jeanne, passionately wanted to become a famous photographer.  Deciding not to dream, but to act, she painted all the tasks, intermediate goals, and then did, in my opinion, even more labor-intensive work.  Zhanna ordered a poster consisting of 365 cells in the printing house, into which she introduced certain tasks, intermediate goals, placing a picture of herself in the center with a camera in her hands.  Every day, this purposeful woman did what helped her achieve her goal, and eventually achieved her goal. <br>  But I want to draw your attention not to the thoroughness of planning, but to the way of visualization - a large calendar.  When there is a point of reference before our eyes, the difficulties that have already been passed and that need to be overcome, when we see the results that have already been achieved, this is really inspiring.  Barbara Cher, in her book Dreaming Is Not Harmful, describes in great detail how to create such a planning wall.  ‚ÄúYou can cover the wall with corkboard and multi-colored buttons to attach schemes to it.  You can put them on the tape, removing the waste and attaching a new one.  Or glue the wall with a smooth self-adhesive shelf film and paint the schemes with washable markers.  You can use magnets on the side of a metal rack or refrigerator. ‚Äù <br><br>  In general, the goal itself can indicate the visualization methods. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Do you dream to go to hot countries?  Decorate the house with compositions of seashells. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Learn the basics of programming?  Find a future customer and agree with him about the timing of the first task, and additionally motivate yourself with infographics. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Lose weight?  Hang the most stunning new dress in size 42 in size. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Want to read 52 books?  Arrange all of them on the bookshelf, removing the readings or crossing them out in your list if you are reading the electronic versions. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Learn English?  Place on your board a super-complex text that you can‚Äôt master in any way so that it motivates you to work harder. <br><br>  Make the path to your goal more pleasant and more interesting with the help of various ways of visualization.  Combine them with each other or invent your own methods to help you achieve your cherished dream. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d88/290/fd4/d88290fd421c46a2aeff2efd6817a9f0.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/300076/">https://habr.com/ru/post/300076/</a></p>
