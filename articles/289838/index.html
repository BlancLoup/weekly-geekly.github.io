It is he who sets the policy of the party in relation to the filling, and in relation to the strategy of product development.  He knows everything about the desires of the consumer, predicts what will happen to the market for which his product is designed, in general, he lives and breathes his product.

He loves his team, knows how to concretize the desires of the customer and solve problems, plan and structure the work, but does not know how to invent a bicycle that every child will want for up to a year. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6b0/9be/fa6/6b09befa6aba43df9666b8664b8038d7.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Main competencies:</b> collection and analysis of requirements, setting goals, monitoring the timing and budget of projects, resource planning, technological aspects of the project. <br>  <b>Rarely applies:</b> strategic planning, risk analysis, marketing. <br><br>  According to my observations, these people live with the project before the deadline, make sure that the project satisfies the customer and say goodbye to the project, as a rule, not knowing whether it paid off or not, whether it made a proper impression on the users and how the customer lives with it further. <br><br><h5>  Third - account </h5><br>  The account manager, the account manager, is the one in whose dreams the client loves him and his company, cooperates only with them and, in hypothetical thoughts, does not allow a change of contractor.  He loves his clients, knows everything about their business, customers of this business and competitors, using any budget, looking for ways to increase sales of a client‚Äôs business, recognition of its brand and winning the hearts of consumers of the product of this business.  Practically can not live if his client has one non-dynamic product. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4ce/878/3e7/4ce8783e70a444d784c02441dfb50d3f.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Core competencies:</b> communication, sales, marketing, requirements collection and analysis. <br>  <b>Rarely applies:</b> strategic planning, risk analysis, technological aspects, setting goals, monitoring the timing and budget of projects. <br><br>  According to my observations, these people also live up to the deadline according to the task declared by the customer, but solve it in all possible and impossible ways, invent bicycles and space ships so that the task is solved and the customer is satisfied.  It is not even so important whether the customer has solved the business problem through the product embodied in the account, it is important that the next time the customer turns to the same account again.  Injuy, as they say, is the process, the result and the universal love that goes with it. <br><br><h5>  Fourth - Sale </h5><br>  Sales manager, sales manager (English sales manager) is the one who thinks happiness, if the client, having fallen in love with his offer, wanted not only to buy the proposed solution, but also to pay for services more than the amount of the invoice.  Even if the customer did not have this need.  Even if the company in which Sales is working cannot realize the solution proposed by Sale for the indicated price.  The most important thing is to sell, get the order and go to the next sale. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3d2/abc/804/3d2abc80482e426dbca148632a9b2677.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Core competencies:</b> communication, sales. <br>  <b>Rarely applies:</b> strategic planning, risk analysis, technological aspects, setting goals, monitoring the timing and budget of projects, resource planning, technological aspects. <br><br>  According to my observations, these people finely build the first contact and convincingly convince that the customer needs a vital decision from this artist, that it is better than others, will bring millions and absolute happiness after implementation.  Yes, it does not matter what happens after the implementation of the sold decision, how unprofitable it will be to the customer and the contractor, how it will affect the popularity of the customer‚Äôs product.  It is important to sign a contract and go to find the next client. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cbe/969/13b/cbe96913b9384ca69200fe847920b087.jpeg"><br><br>  <i>Well, except for the word "manager" they are united?</i>  <i>Undoubtedly - the ability to solve problems, whether it is the invention of a bicycle, the organization of an intergalactic sausage cooking tournament or the development of a software product.</i>  <i>It is important that a representative of each role be in his place; it is then that their effectiveness will more than delight both the customer and colleagues.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/289838/">https://habr.com/ru/post/289838/</a></p>
