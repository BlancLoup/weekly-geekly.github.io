      No matter how it sounded, but a person after a hard working day prefers not to be strained.  And they made a choice for him.  After all, if you think about it, modern advertisers and service providers already have the necessary knowledge base: data on TV viewing time, preferences, work or leisure is enough to understand what the subscriber needs. <br><br>  We must not lose sight of the fact that in a dynamic world a person does not have enough time to spend with loved ones, and he appreciates the moments when the family gathers in front of the TV screen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/44b/d6d/530/44bd6d5307456615fa7e1a70861bd9f2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  An experiment called "TV-detox" showed the dependence of people on watching TV.  Viacom Global Insights in partnership with Think, a research company, conducted an unusual study.  His goal was to study the sensations and behavior of people who for several days were isolated from watching TV content on any devices. <br><br>  More than 16 thousand people, aged from 6 to 44 years from 14 countries, took part in the experiment.  In the first five days, respondents were banned from watching virtually any TV: paid, free-to-air, cable networks, video on demand, TV in channel applications and providers.  Only streaming subscriptions - SVOD. <br>  The next five days were the opposite: research participants were deprived of the opportunity to view the video by subscription, but allowed to watch TV. <br><br>  Upon completion of the experiment, viewers responded that during the five-day isolation from television, they lacked the emotions and sensations that TV gives: feelings of relaxation, a sense of belonging to a family, common interests and family time, a desire to be aware of what is happening and to find out something for themselves something new.  At the same time, most of them noted that without watching a video by subscription, they lived much easier than without being able to watch TV in the usual way. <br><br>  United States <br><br>  New research suggests that the average person in the United States watches TV for almost five hours a day, an hour more than the average in the largest countries in the world. <br>  In fact, the peak of television viewing was in 2009-2010.  Then the average American family spent 8 hours and 55 minutes a day watching television.  In the "zero" was observed the most significant increase in time watching TV in a decade.  Over the past 8 years, content sources such as Facebook, YouTube, Netflix and other resources have reduced the time of watching TV by only an hour.  But the American family still spends more than 7 hours and 50 minutes a day near the TV. <br><br>  Contrary to expert forecasts, ‚Äúcutting the cord‚Äù ‚Äîthat is, the abolition of traditional pay-TV subscriptions in favor of streaming on demand ‚Äî has not yet become a mass phenomenon in the United States. <br><br>  Although the decline since Q2 2009 is more than three million subscribers, this is not a massive trend that many expected after Netflix, Amazon Prime and other online services reached the peak of their development. <br>  While the growth of online video has certainly not made it easier for pay-TV providers to work, most consumers do not seem to plan to cancel pay-TV subscription. <br><br>  71% of US consumers watch cable or satellite TV and do not plan to give it up.  Answering the question about the main reason ‚Äúnot to cut the cable‚Äù, 18% of respondents said that they were just used to it, while 16% indicated the convenience of viewing multiple channels in one place. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/69f/5bf/4b3/69f5bf4b3a010a1d0588af65bafa4f34.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Latin America <br><br>  As part of a large-scale study, TGI Latin asked respondents if they planned to watch TV.  32.6% answered that it is included in their daily schedule.  In and of itself, this should be perceived as a remarkable phenomenon, in which one third of the population plans their lives around television programs. <br><br>  Survey results help to better understand the audience and their preferences.  For example, in any age group, women have a higher level of addiction to TV.  Among men, the highest adherence is observed in adolescents.  Interestingly, the highest rates are among the youngest and oldest groups. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b57/4c6/04e/b574c604e5244831cd9bb7dc7cba8d83.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The following graph is an indicator of the socio-economic standard of living. <br><br>  The highest - A = 10%, <br>  Lower - D = 40%. <br><br>  It can be concluded that the overall level of television viewing decreases with an increase in the socio-economic level.  While television is the main form of entertainment for the lower class, it is not so important for the higher social strata. <br>  Time watching television is directly related to the standard of living in the country.  Mexico has the lowest.  At the same time, Mexico is the largest exporter of Hispanic programs for all of Latin America. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d39/023/5aa/d390235aa7d0c72eebb620756cdd4769.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  According to the results of the study, conclusions can be drawn as to which types of video content will be more relevant in a particular country.  For example, those people who are more likely to watch TV on schedule will be more likely to watch the development of a television series, talk shows and religious programs. <br><br><br>  Television in Brazil <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/455/6ee/a5f/4556eea5f524cf08474b90edcdbb031a.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Brazilians spend more than five hours a day watching TV. <br><br><br>  In Brazil, the presence of a television means social inclusion.  This is the most popular source of content in the country: at least one TV is in 95% of Brazilian homes.  Brazilians directly associate TV with status: the bigger and more advanced the TV, the richer the family. <br><br>  Brazilians are happy to watch almost any content: from football to soap operas, which men look on a par with women, and they see nothing wrong with that. <br><br><br>  Conclusion <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/486/971/426/486971426905c224b6f0e2ce029f2af4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Television has long become an important part of our lives.  But people watch content differently.  The older generation is almost not distracted by affairs and does not switch channels.  Men are spontaneous, and women more often plan leisure in advance.  But there are no groups that do not watch TV at all - anyway, it is present everywhere. <br><br>  Viewers do not always need a choice.  In front of the TV you want to relax, rest and spend time with your family.  Therefore, the importance of TV in the life of a modern person is difficult to overestimate, despite the differences in generations and mentality. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/444068/">https://habr.com/ru/post/444068/</a></p>
