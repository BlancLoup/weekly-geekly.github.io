For this reason, I decided to share with you a piece of my many years of experience, on the example of one game, which is somehow connected with the theme of Habrahabr. <br><br>  It so happens that I do quite a lot of non-formal education.  Work in children's and teen camps requires the ability to present the necessary information so that it is interesting for people to receive it, and they want more and more.  Usually, children need to be taught what is connected with the theme of the camp, and the theme of the camp is related to what the camp sponsors want ... No one will tolerate dry information in the camps, for this reason the information is usually heard through various events, including games.  Very often counselors simply adapt existing games, but I prefer to invent my own.  And so I wanted to create a game that would teach the guys something from the IT theme.  So there was a game "Torrents".  The game is very simple and does not require anything other than sheets of paper, pencils and a few printed pictures. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/319/d6c/3f9/319d6c3f95bf4f81f8a2a4ccfef0d078.png">

      For one camp, you usually have to spend a dozen different games, ranging from large long games to the whole camp and ending with small short toys for one squad of ~ 20 people.  This is the game "Torrents". <br>  I realized that even many of my friends do not even know how the torrent system works.  Therefore, I decided to visually show their work at the most superficial level. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  For the most impatient: </h4><br>  The game will consist in the fact that players exchange a picture through the Torrent system.  There are participants who have some pieces of the picture, and people can draw details that are not enough for them from people who sit next to them (let's call them <i>neighbors</i> ).  Although no one originally had a full image, in the end after the exchange everyone will have a full picture. <br><br><h4>  Preparing for the game </h4><br>  Required materials: <br><ul><li>  A4 paper sheets (by number of participants) </li><li>  Pencils (by the number of participants) </li><li>  Washing gum (by the number of participants) </li><li>  Prepared material that we will ‚Äúhand out‚Äù (picture) </li></ul><br><br><h5>  How to make players </h5><br>  To start the game, participants need to be seated in the correct figure - a figure imitating the look of a network of torrents ... That is, the devil knows how.  In fact, this is the most difficult moment: players must be a closed network, where everyone communicates with each other through N players and each has at least two neighbors.  For example, the easiest option would be a circle. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0f2/f1e/e2e/0f2f1ee2ee7865aea6f70c62a6d6e37a.png"><br><br>  Or for further convenience, its deformed shape is a star. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8e9/59e/310/8e959e3100f6c717c4316fbcafadab8d.png"><br><br>  It is important for a participant to know who his <i>neighbors are</i> .  This needs to be remembered while seating the participants.  This is already bad: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b38/58c/63b/b3858c63b6c634dd421550b829e9880a.png"><br><br>  Although it will be more interesting to play in this form, the players in the center will probably get confused about who their neighbor is and who isn't.  Therefore, for the first time, we will arrange the players simply in the form of a star.  We'll give each one a piece of paper, a pencil and an eraser. <br><br><h5>  What should players do </h5><br>  Each participant of the game is at the same time not only ‚Äúdownloading‚Äù but also ‚Äúdistributing‚Äù.  It is very important that the players are aware of this and keep their sheet in sight.  The only thing that is allowed to the players in this game is to redraw what they see from the neighbors on the sheets on their sheet. <br><br>  Also, several people in the group have a piece of the picture that was originally distributed to them.  You can also draw from it.  It is from these originally distributed pieces that the final picture of all players is formed.  We'll put people with these things on the ends of a star to make it easier. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c23/7df/813/c237df813358e49b280c20bc3dc3f70e.png"><br><br><h5>  What should be ‚Äúhanding out‚Äù picture </h5><br>  It is unlikely that all participants in the game are great artists.  Therefore, it is important to make the image not too complicated, and, if possible, consist <a href="https://www.google.lv/search%3Fq%3Dclip%2Bart%26client%3Dfirefox-a%26rls%3Dorg.mozilla:en-US:official%26channel%3Dsb%26source%3Dlnms%26tbm%3Disch%26sa%3DX%26ei%3D9HEFU_rDI8XftAabq4DQBA%26sqi%3D2%26ved%3D0CAcQ_AUoAQ%26biw%3D1920%26bih%3D976">of simple lines</a> .  It should be more sketchy drawings than works of art. <br><br>  I advise something like this: <br><img width="400" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/426/5ce/8ee/4265ce8ee0aa2ca4624d1eb45e90cbe7.jpg"><br>  <sub>the picture is <a href="http://www.colornimbus.com/tractor-picture-coloring-page/">not mine</a></sub> <br><br>  Well, of course, we don‚Äôt need a picture, by which you can immediately understand what it is all about.  Therefore, we will make a collage: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/25a/10d/d33/25a10dd3387ca0c799f773713ea7542c.png"><br>  <sub>all pictures are from <a href="http://google.com/">google.com</a></sub> <br><br>  And then you need to divide the resulting image into the number of people who initially will have a piece of the file to distribute. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6dd/d96/dbf/6ddd96dbf7ac50e70be3cb9cf8ad6456.png"><br><br>  Everyone should get only one piece of the overall picture ... And then you will most likely make a mistake: the simplest thing would be to cut the picture along the lines.  But this is the wrong approach, for having received a triangle, the participant in the game will not know where he should be on the page.  If he starts to draw him in the wrong place, and other participants "download" this wrong version from him, then everything is a blockade game.  Therefore, we will make there that the forked pieces of the collage immediately speak about where they are: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/30d/6e2/105/30d6e21058bfc4da3830378bf616d801.png"><br><br><h5>  Goal of the game </h5><br>  You will be surprised, but people do not always strive to win.  When declaring the rules of the game, you can say that the winner is the one who has the first picture in his hands ... or vice versa - the last one who does not have the picture will become Chmir.  It does not matter.  Because the main thing is that people enjoy the process itself, and usually players understand this ... And in the real world there are no bad and good guys in torrents - everyone is equal. <br>  <sup>Yes, I did conduct games in which there were no winners and losers, but people still liked to play them.</sup>  <sup>I was not beaten or burned.</sup> <br><br><h4>  Possible improvements </h4><br>  So you don‚Äôt have to wait, you can make the game more entertaining by dividing the picture into all players at once.  That is, everyone can immediately begin to distribute, and therefore download ... Ideally, this is a good solution, but usually you never know exactly how many people will be in a group, and therefore it is difficult to prepare for this version of the game. <br>  If you like the game, and participants want to play it more, you can complicate it by creating more complex torrent network schemes, breaking connections between specific participants at different times, disconnecting / enabling users, and generally making more and more complications. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  Well, now the curtain of creating non-computer games has opened in front of you, and I, in turn, seem to be a little nafludil in Habrahabr.  Do not judge strictly, I will be glad of any reaction.  And good luck when you play it. <br><br>  PS Yes, to briefly and clearly explain the rules of the game to the players - this is a separate art.  Of course, the players themselves do not need to know everything described in this article. <br><br>  <b>UPD.</b>  I read the comments.  All offer to somehow facilitate the drawing, because not all Picasso and Van Gogi.  You do not need to do this at all - yes, the drawings will be clumsy, but this will only add fun to the game!  Drop computer accuracy, people play the game for fun, and after the game is over they will look at the squalor with great pleasure, which they did, something to be proud of, how they copied the images exactly by pixels and cells. <br>  We making fun here, not printings. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/213241/">https://habr.com/ru/post/213241/</a></p>
