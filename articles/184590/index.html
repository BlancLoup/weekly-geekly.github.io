As our experience has shown, surveys about careers among students of our Technopark can yield very interesting results (one of our past studies was <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/174479/">extensively discussed</a> here).  We decided not to stop - this time we found out from the students what the criteria were chosen by young technicians from the Moscow State Technical University.  Bauman who study at Technopark. <br><br>  I have to admit, the study was interesting again.  Details and some thoughts - under the cut. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6d0/e9a/b8b/6d0e9ab8bd61d7f616a6247d73dfedf9.jpg">

      <b>Work for interest</b> <br><br>  Remember that <a href="http://corp.mail.ru/press/news/1691">poll</a> - 32.8% of students expect their salary after university to be more than 150 thousand rubles?  Given this, it is interesting that the wages only for 23% of the respondents is key.  The rest say that this is not the most, and often - not a significant factor of choice at all.  This suggests two conclusions: <br><br><ol><li>  or students have an illusory idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe average salary in their specialty: ‚ÄúPay what you want - at least 100 thousand, at least 150!‚Äù </li><li>  or at the initial stage of their career, young technical specialists really set other priorities, that is, they choose a company depending on the tasks it can offer.  And recalling the previous study, it is joyful that students see interesting tasks for themselves in Russian IT companies. </li></ol><br><br>  Surprisingly, only for 23% of respondents is the company known in the market, the rest do not attach much importance to this.  However, the majority insists on the availability of training within the company.  Even more pleased that the vast majority of students are set to professional and career growth in one company.  The potential "flyers" turned out to be only 11%. <br><br>  <b>Paradise in the IT hut</b> <br><br>  Again, the paradox - many large companies are trying to provide their employees with insurance, fitness and other goodies, and for 70% of employees (or rather, future employees, and now students) this, it turns out, is not at all important.  52% and 18% believe that the main thing is interesting tasks and timely remuneration of labor, ‚Äúwork is not chosen for the fintes!‚Äù. <br><br>  However, perhaps the point here is that many respondents at the time of the survey could not have had full-time experience.  Remembering my initial ideas about the future employer - the least thing I personally cared about was whether I would pay for the treatment of my teeth, or whether my insurance would do it for me.  Such privileges you begin to appreciate over time. <br><br>  <b>findings</b> <br><br>  Well, the survey showed that students are ready to accumulate experience by all means - while the salary and social bonuses go into the background. <br><br>  From here emerge two models of future specialists: <br><br>  1) Students starting their careers from the second or third year.  It is quite logical that in the pursuit of experience in solving combat missions, young workers neglect issues of wages and social packages.  Having obtained the necessary experience in parallel with studying at the university, by the fifth year it is already possible to build more ambitious plans. <br><br>  2) Graduates.  Young professionals with the above settings are the best fit for working in a large company side by side with experts, or in a startup (perhaps also within a large company) - although it‚Äôs necessary to fill the bumps on their own.  Enormous experience and professional growth, in which everyone can become a strong unit, they are provided. <br><br>  It remains to understand how long such priorities will be strong on the way to achieving money, fame, social packages and a kicker in the office. <br><br>  PS: ideas for the following surveys are accepted in the comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/184590/">https://habr.com/ru/post/184590/</a></p>
