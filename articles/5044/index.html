  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Games under DirectX 9 slow down in Vista.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Although Microsoft promised, but it did not manage to ensure full backward compatibility of the new version of DirectX 10 (as is known, this version is <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/column/1771/">completely redone</a> , therefore it is radically different from the previous one) and old versions of DirectX.  The radical changes in the drivers have a negative impact on the performance of old games from Windows XP, especially shooters.  These problems are evidenced by <a href="http://forums.guru3d.com/showthread.php%3Fthreadid%3D213511">numerous complaints</a> on gaming forums. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The greatest number of problems arises with the popular "shooters" CounterStrike, Half-Life 2, Doom 3 and FEAR. These games can be interrupted at any time with an error message.  Even if this does not happen, it still became less pleasant to play: the performance of programs (frames per second) under Vista is noticeably lower than under XP.  According to experts, this problem has several reasons: poor-quality drivers, the complexity of Vista and the lack of video cards that were originally optimized for DirectX 10 technology. <br><br>  DirectX 10 technology should take the gaming industry to the next level of development.  Among the most significant advantages of DX10 are completely new three-dimensional effects, an order of magnitude better detailing of 3D objects and moving objects, reduction of the load on the central processor, much more realistic sky, clouds, smoke, wool, wood, reflections on water and other surfaces.  However, to implement the features of DirectX 10, three components are required: a completely new type of video card, such as the Nvidia GeForce 8000, the Windows Vista operating system, and new games.  Old games on old video cards, as it turned out, do not work very well under DirectX 10. And this is despite Microsoft‚Äôs assurances of the full backward compatibility of DX10 and DX9. <br><br>  At the same time, new games for DX10 will not appear soon.  According to the most pessimistic experts (the leadership of Nvidia), such games will appear no earlier than mid-2008, <a href="http://computerworld.com/action/article.do%3Fcommand%3DprintArticleBasic%26articleId%3D9011078">writes Computerworld</a> .  DirectX 10 technology was so revolutionary that developing software for it turned out to be very difficult.  Even its own Windows-based interface called Aero - and that uses DirectX 9 in its work.

      The first video cards for DirectX 10 also have not appeared yet.  For example, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radeon_R600">Radeon R600</a> graphics processor is expected to be released in mid-spring, and for the first compatible GeForce 8800 graphics card, the drivers are still in beta and are not certified by Microsoft.  The procedure for certifying drivers now, as we know, has become much more complicated - this is due to the new ‚Äúpass-through protection‚Äù system against illegal copying, on which Windows Vista is based (in more detail <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/column/2132/">here</a> ). <br><br>  At this time, gamers create lists of games that are compatible / incompatible with Windows Vista.  Information is updated on the sites <a href="http://compatdb.org/">Compatdb.org</a> and <a href="http://www.ntcompatible.org/">NTcompatible.com</a> . <br><br>  Numerous equipment makers, including Logitech, Creative Technology and Cisco, have already received lawsuits from users due to the fact that the drivers produced by these companies do not work well under Windows Vista.  Now the same suit <a href="http://www.nvidiaclassaction.org/">is being prepared against Nvidia by angry gamers</a> .  In response, Nvidia has opened a special <a href="https://surveys.nvidia.com/index.jsp%3Fpi%3D7498eac864dc1950c8f09e040b4a437a">webpage</a> where users can report driver problems under Windows Vista. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/5044/">https://habr.com/ru/post/5044/</a></p>
