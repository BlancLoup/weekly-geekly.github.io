  <section class="page js-page"><h1>meeting on the Elbe?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The other day I received a personal invitation to the ‚ÄúElba‚Äù conference by mail - apparently, my ‚Äúwide popularity in narrow circles‚Äù of startups affected. <br><br>  To be honest, a little tired of such invitations.  Conferences, where regular investors are looking for new projects, are already tiring: most often they are held under the auspices of one investor who himself does not know what he wants, except for one thing - to get the effect from these investments as quickly as possible.  ‚ÄúLong money‚Äù on the Internet market has not been seen for a long time, at least - their owners usually do not attend such events. <br>  But still overlooked their site, read the information, talked with knowledgeable people ... And decided to go to show my project.  And seriously expect to get money for a share in it. <br><br>  Without revealing, at the request of those invited, unnecessary names and regalia, I can only hint - for the first time a conference will be held, which will be attended by serious investors with relatively ‚Äúlong money‚Äù.  They need a conference because they know almost nothing about the Russian Internet business.  So this time to get a serious offer to a confident startup startup is quite real.  I'm just like that, without too much modesty.  We have been doing a project about mobile TV for a long time already with our colleagues, and now the most opportune moment for an investor to enter an already prepared startup that needs money for promotion and promotion. <br>  The organizers of "ElBy" on their website say - "to find money is much easier than a project!"  It seems that they are still in the yard at the end of the 90s, when the programmer was worth his weight in gold and was valued as a nuclear physicist.  And then, too, no one understood the meaning of the projects, but everyone was ready to give the last money "for the long term."  I recently heard that the "money bags", desperate to make money on the crashed real estate market, are painfully looking for where to put the released cash - apparently, Elba is just such a case.

      Behind all this, there is clearly a ‚Äúbag of money‚Äù, which either PR wants to organize, or has heard a lot about ‚ÄúRussian craftsmen‚Äù and wants ‚Äúto be a fool‚Äù to snip off its tidbits.  I consider it not a crime not to take advantage of such a proposal - then they themselves will be guilty if they fly by. <br>  Personally, I will go alone, so as not to pay extra money for the rest of the team.  The application has already been submitted.  Although it is strange to me personally that they only call for one representative from the team - all investors always say that ‚Äúit is important for us to see the team‚Äù, ‚Äúthe team is the key to the project‚Äôs success‚Äù, ‚Äúin software projects, people decide everything‚Äù, and they themselves only call one man.  Perhaps this is another indicator of the "professionalism" of the organizers. <br>  I can imagine the reaction of some habrazhiteli to my application.  If you feel jealous - I sympathize.  It's so ‚Äúin Russian‚Äù - to shove your achievements far away and shy to speak openly - ‚Äúyes, I can, I can, I can manage, I'm the best.‚Äù  With this kind of attitude, most of the topics are written, where the next Internet startup is being promoted.  But with this attitude, you can only count on the fact that someone pats you on the head, and someone laughs at the curved code in the engine.  With this attitude it is useless to count on the development of your business.  I will be on the Elbe, I will adequately present my project - and I hope that there will be quite enough confident people in Habr√© with whom we will meet at this event.  Do not miss the same two days in the society of "money bags". </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/75360/">https://habr.com/ru/post/75360/</a></p>
