At that time, I was the quick problem manager.  Tasks that others would solve in three days, I solved in three hours.  The boss called me, described the situation, asked ‚Äúthey say, today‚Äù, and I did.  Because I already knew what and how it works in our company and to whom it is necessary to turn on what matter.

      And how are you looking for information in your organization?  It is possible that as described below.  If you are a new employee, you are asking your supervisor for any new question.  He begins to introduce you to new people.  If he has enough patience, then gradually your contact base grows.  At some point, the situation comes that you already know all the key people, you figure out who does what, you know what to ask.  If a question arises, contact the right person and learn everything from him.  From a technical point of view, this means that your personal search engine has been indexed for several months or years, the index is in your head, and you are looking for in the heads of your colleagues. <br><br>  What else is besides personal contacts? <a name="habracut"></a>  There is a group e-mail newsletter.  You ask a question, you get a couple of unsuccessful answers, and then two dozen letters like ‚ÄúStop writing at all!‚Äù <br><br>  Even in your organization there are several internal corporate portals.  You will surely find answers to sample questions there, but you will encounter difficulties in an unusual situation.  And their search index is probably not combined ( <i>if you have several portals with a general search, please write, really want to know the cost of the solution</i> ).  For example, Microsoft‚Äôs IT industry leader has more than 700 (!) Internal corporate portals.  As an employee of this company, in which of them will you look? <br><br>  There are still forums, but I cannot ask any question there, because administrators can ban me if I break the structured logic of this forum with my question. <br><br>  So here I offer an interesting alternative.  If you have Bitrix24, Jive, Yammer, DaOffice or IBM Connections, then they most likely work for your entire organization and everything that people in the system do is indexed there.  Search takes place in the contents of the correspondence, groups, user names and tags.  In essence, the organization for you becomes flat.  But even more remarkable is the fact that there are groups in these instruments and there are people in them.  Therefore, the search is carried out in two stages: 1) you make a request in the search window, and if this is not enough, then 2) make a request to the group that was found by your request, even without knowing who exactly you can answer. <br><br>  Here are a couple of examples of how the search looks in <a href="https://community.jivesoftware.com/welcome">Jive's</a> and <a href="https://www.yammer.com/itpronetwork/">Yammer</a> communities. <br><br><img width="425" alt="Jive-x" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/c95/899/c92/c95899c92f65ede9da99b541b80ace93.png" height="450" title="Jive-x"><img width="276" alt="Yammer" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/c81/f2f/42b/c81f2f42b2a49b88f0688dd03b154a45.png" height="450" title="Yammer"><br><br>  It turns out something similar to a neural network, close to what is happening in the human brain (thanks to Dmitry Garin for the fact that at one time it is up to this). <br><br>  I have already <a href="http://supereon.ru/blog/esn_oilgas/%3Fsphrase_id%3D49">mentioned one</a> personal success story of such a search.  As an employee of Microsoft, I was able to find the right person for me exclusively using Yammer.  Here is another good example.  In December, I participated in an open Yammer development workshop for a large organization.  So they recognized that the new employee is recognized as his only after three years of work in the company.  This is the time it takes for a person to figure out and get comfortable in a corporate environment.  And in one of the working groups, the task was formulated as ‚ÄúYammer - year in three.‚Äù  I think this is the most super mission of the corporate social network I have ever met. <br><br>  *** <br><br>  The proposed search engine has limitations. <br><br>  The first.  By default, everything is open on the corporate social network.  Perhaps you will find in your organization something that you don‚Äôt like very much and it would be better if you don‚Äôt know.  It is difficult to fight this.  It may be necessary to understand in time that the search engine is looking for too much and not to use it.  Seriously. <br><br>  The second.  A corporate social network can provide so much information that it will easily overload users.  It's easier to deal with this.  As well as in e-mail - in corporate social networks means are implemented to resist the onslaught of information.  These funds took the following forms: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Following / friends.</b>  You only receive messages from subscribed users in the feed.  And do not subscribe to people you don‚Äôt want. </li><li>  <b>Subscriptions.</b>  You can also subscribe to documents or discussions, in which case you will see their changes.  It is useful when there is a joint work on some important document. </li><li>  <b>Groups</b>  You subscribe to certain groups, on a specific topic, information flows are limited to the tasks and audience of the group.  Usually 10-15 groups is the limit of what you need. </li><li>  <b>News filters.</b>  Specially pre-selected groups, people and tags for which information is collected.  For example, news streams in Jive. </li></ul><br>  At the same time, there is one more unsolved problem.  You do not remember the keywords that need to be searched.  But this is not a question for the search engine))). <br><br>  <b>Vladimir Ivanitsa</b> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ivanitsa"><u>Facebook</u></a> |  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vivanitsa"><u>LinkedIn</u></a> <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298856/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298856/</a></p>
