The fastest growing trend has become an abbreviation used to invite friends to go somewhere. <br><br>  People add the HMU abbreviation (hit me up) to their statuses when, after being released from business, they want to meet with friends.  This abbreviation means ‚Äúcontact me‚Äù (or something like ‚Äúdon't forget me‚Äù) and it was rarely used last year, but in 2010 it suddenly became popular, especially during summer holidays and weekends.

      During the second study of Facebook memology, the company focused on the use of which words in the statuses grew the most in 2010 compared to the previous one.  The results reflect world events, joyful and mournful, which made people talk about themselves, new ways of using the language on the net, and talking about popular culture between friends. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>World events</b> <b><br></b> <br>  Whether it was the tragedy of the earthquake in Haiti or the rescue of the Chilean miners (‚Äúmineros‚Äù in Spanish), world news attracted everyone‚Äôs attention.  People together were sad, worried and hoped.  Some even shared what is happening in Haiti and Chile from the scene. <br><br>  The world united during the World Cup - during the key matches up to half of all statuses were about the events of the championship. <br><br>  <b>I'm sorry, what?</b> <b><br></b> <br>  HMU debut did not become the only manifestation of the spoken language on the network.  This year they talked a lot about airplanes, but not because people suddenly found out that there was such a way to travel, but because the song BoB ‚ÄúAirplanes‚Äù was extremely popular.  ‚ÄúBuilding a barn‚Äù became the most popular phrase in the games category, because players asked to help them in the game FarmVille on Facebook. <br><br>  <b>Bieber Fever</b> <b><br></b> <br>  Pop culture also influenced people's conversations.  Fans of Justin Bieber could not help but share his joy and ensured that he is the only musician in the top statuses.  After the premiere of the films ‚ÄúToy Story 3‚Äù and ‚ÄúTwilight.  Saga.  Eclipse "friends also shared their impressions.  And of course, everyone wanted to look fashionable, telling their friends about the brand new iPad and iPhone 4. <br><br>  For this year‚Äôs memology, Facebook has analyzed status updates in 236 countries.  The company calculated the frequency with which each new status appeared in 2010 and compared it with 2009, and searched for those that changed in percentage and in terms of quantity the most (see list of last year).  All personal information has been removed from the statuses for analysis. <br><br>  Words and phrases were also correlated by meaning, and they were grouped into categories, while compiling the list below. <br><br><img src="http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash1/hs736.ash1/162896_10150117992156729_20531316728_7361951_6807491_n.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>1. HMU</b> <b><br></b> <br>  This acronym for ‚Äúcontact me‚Äù came as a surprise this year.  At the beginning of 2009, no one even heard of the abbreviation of HMU.  Only a few statuses per day contained abbreviations of the HMU, and half of them were probably typos.  However, growth began by May, and there were already about 20 statuses per day.  The number doubled every month, and by the end of 2009 it had increased to 1,600 statuses per day ‚Äî still too small a number to get on last year‚Äôs list. <br><br>  However, HMU continued to spread rapidly and in 2010 increased by 75% every month.  By the end of the summer, the HMU was mentioned 80,000 times a day. <br><br>  In early September, an interesting trend emerged in the use of HMUs.  Until that time, it spread like a fire, but was used evenly throughout the week.  In September, the situation changed, and consumption fluctuated greatly from day to day.  What is the reason?  Until September, the public, allegedly using the HMU, was on vacation and wanted to have fun all day and night.  When the guys went to school, HMU began to be used mostly on weekends. <br><img src="http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash1/hs734.ash1/162871_10150117992481729_20531316728_7361954_701766_n.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>2. World Championship</b> <b><br></b> <br>  The World Cup was the biggest sporting event of 2010, and since Facebook is spread all over the world, people took to the virtual streets to cheer up their teams and boo their rivals.  The opening of the games and the finals attracted the most attention, 1.5 million and 1.3 million mentions, respectively, plus an infinite number of mentions of teams and players.  In the key moments of games up to 50% of the statuses were devoted to this event.  This event was so important that Facebook <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2010/07/02/sports/soccer/facebook-worldcup.html">collaborated with the New York Times</a> to keep track of the mentions of the players. <br><br>  <b>3. Movies</b> <b><br></b> <br>  Like last year, there was a lot of talk about movies.  Toy Story 3, Twilight.  Saga.  Eclipse, Beginning, Alice in Wonderland, and Iron Man are (in that order) in the top five most discussed. <br><br>  It was interesting to learn more about the first weekend of the show "Toy Story 3".  For this, Facebook has shared updates from the computer and from the mobile.  As usual, the premiere took place on Friday, but there were night shows in some US cities.  During the beginning of the film, there were few updates, but when the film ended and the audience shared their opinions, there was a jump in activity. <br><br>  Naturally, mobile Internet users could update the status immediately after the film, and computer users had to get home.  The difference in bursts of activity gives an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow long it takes on average to get from the cinema to the house - about half an hour. <br><br>  <b>4. iPad and iPhone 4</b> <b><br></b> <br>  In May, Apple overtook its long-time rival Microsoft in terms of market capitalization, largely due to the two most discussed products of the year: iPad and iPhone 4. These two products became the subject of 25 million statuses, in which their authors boasted, praised, and sometimes scolded these innovations in during the year. <br><br>  <b>5. Haiti</b> <b><br></b> <br>  The earthquake on January 12 is clearly reflected in the statuses.  And although most people were far from the scene, they shared experiences and news with friends and the world.  One woman from Boston found herself locked up in Haiti with a group of 36 travelers and, with the help of statuses, found out from friends what was happening, and she herself told the families that the group was out of danger. <br><br>  Within a minute from the beginning of the 7-magnitude earthquake, a wave of statuses rolled.  Since the infrastructure of Haiti was badly damaged, many messages came from the nearby Dominican Republic, where people felt strong shocks (the earthquake called ‚Äúterremoto‚Äù).  Reports of eyewitnesses began to appear 4 minutes after the start of the earthquake, at a speed of 120 messages per minute.  It took a few more hours for the world to learn about the tragedy, and a day later Facebook users were discussing the disaster at a speed of 1,800 statuses per minute. <br><br><img src="http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc4/hs1191.snc4/154326_10150117993566729_20531316728_7361966_3425012_n.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>6. Justin Bieber</b> <b><br></b> <br>  The Bieber Fever began even before 2010, but apparently this year was outstanding for a 15-year-old pop star.  The increase in the number of references was largely dependent on the success of his career during the year.  He began 2010 with the January release of his best hit, Baby.  And the debut of September 12 at the MTV Video Music Awards caused the largest number of mentions. <br><br>  <b>7. Games on Facebook</b> <b><br></b> <br>  Popular applications on Facebook are games, and links to them have appeared throughout the year.  The most popular phrase was ‚Äúbuilding a barn‚Äù.  No, there was no mass exodus of Facebook users from cities to the countryside.  Instead, users gathered friends for virtual agnalog of the ancient tradition of joint construction of a barn by the whole village.  It started when FarmVille launched the possibility of building a barn in January.  FrontierVille, launched in June, also gained popularity over the year. <br><br>  <b>8. Miners</b> <b><br></b> <br>  The history of 33 Chilean miners locked up underground took the world for 69 days.  People around the world watched the events of an inspirational story unfold, and saw how they were ultimately saved one by one by spending an unimaginable amount of time underground. <br><br>  By tracking comments about the miners, Facebook saw three spikes of activity.  The first was only in Chile in August, when the mine collapsed, and contact with the miners was lost.  A week later, they discovered the miners who miraculously survived, and they began to talk about this little by little in the world, but still it basically remained a Chilean theme.  Over the next 60 days, the world observed the efforts of workers who drilled rescue shafts from the surface. <br><br>  When the disaster was over, millions of people reported it.  In fact, people followed the events so closely that if you take a closer look at the number of messages, it turns out that there were 33 peaks of activity in the final ‚Äî one for each saved miner. <br><img src="http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc4/hs1238.snc4/157074_10150118020711729_20531316728_7362349_3127815_n.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>9. Aircraft</b> <b><br></b> <br>  There is nothing new or remarkable in the word "planes" - at least, so it seemed to us.  But in 2010, it took the lead thanks to the text of the international hit Airplanes.  A more detailed study showed that people specifically quoted these lines, often to share their desires or to report on the trip. <br><img src="http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash1/hs739.ash1/163143_10150117994121729_20531316728_7361974_4996984_n.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>10. 2011</b> <b><br></b> <br>  Like last year, people often talk in status about dates.  Users are looking forward to the personal events of the coming year - maybe the wedding or the birth of a child. On January 1, 2010 there were many statuses with the mention of 2011, as people regarded the coming year as an opportunity to look into the next.  With the approach of the new year, the number of mentions is increasing, as more and more plans appear for the next year. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/110073/">https://habr.com/ru/post/110073/</a></p>
