  <section class="page js-page"><h1>About CALEA in Russian</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  What have you heard about CALEA?  I think I will not be mistaken if I say that they have not heard absolutely nothing.  Well, then let's get right to the point. <br><br>  CALEA is the <i>Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act</i> , i.e.  <i>Law on Assistance and Assistance of Telecom Providers to Law Enforcement Agencies</i> .  Some information can be obtained from the <a href="http://www.calea.org/">official website of</a> this legislation, as well as from an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_Assistance_for_Law_Enforcement_Act">article in Wikipedia</a> (both resources are in English), or you can read the <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Communications_Assistance_for_Law_Enforcement_Act">text of the law in</a> full (also in English).  What is behind such an intricate name?  In short, legalization of wiretapping and interception of personal data transmitted via other communication channels, including the Internet (via VoIP).  For a detailed understanding, let‚Äôs read a <a href="http://apps.creounity.com/time_machine/index.php%3Fgo%3Ddiscourse/article012/CALEAPresentation20Mar08dow2.ppt">presentation</a> by David Ward, Senior Attorney of the United States Bureau of Public and National Security (David Ward, Senior Attorney, Public Safety &amp; Homeland Security Bureau (PSHSB)). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It appears from the preamble of CALEA: "The law of the United States Code on the interim law", i.e.  The law <b>requires</b> telecommunications service providers ( <b>VoIP</b> , <b>broadband Internet</b> , <b>telephone</b> ) to assist US government agencies represented by various federal agencies in intercepting information transmitted by subscribers <b>in real time</b> to enforce the law, as well as with a number of other goals. <br><br>  The providers of the above services should among others: <br><ul><li>  on request &lt;...&gt; structures to intercept data in order to obtain <b>information that allows to identify the caller</b> ("Call Data Channel (CDC) for Call Identifying Information"); </li><li>  carefully and with proper security measures to keep intercepted <b>call records</b> (‚ÄúCall Content Channel (CCC) for Content Information‚Äù), received with or without the permission of subscribers; </li><li>  immediately transfer all requested information to US government agencies. </li></ul><br>  We read further: <br><ul><li>  Service operators who have old telecommunications equipment (purchased before January 1, 1995) and do not have ‚Äúsignificant upgrades or major modifications‚Äù (ie, ‚Äúsignificant technical upgrades or major modifications‚Äù that would make this equipment CALEA compliant) will receive relevant technical upgrades at the expense of the FBI; </li><li>  if the equipment and software were purchased by telecom operators after January 1, 1995, then they are obliged to purchase the missing updates at their own expense and make all the equipment meeting the requirements of CALEA; </li><li>  all new models of network and communication equipment (including iPhone smartphones and others like it) must be CALEA-compatible, i.e.  allowing users to intercept information transmitted by them, both voice and data (Internet traffic, GPS tags, etc.). </li></ul><br>  Words and phrases such as ‚Äú <b>electronic eavesdropping</b> ‚Äù (passive interception of electronic data) and ‚Äú <b>wiretapping</b> ‚Äù (interception and recording of telephone conversations) can be found in the text of the presentation.  The data interception schemes are presented in the second part of the presentation, the tech-savvy interested reader will be able to familiarize himself with them.

      Wiretapping conversations on cell phones is one of the most important tasks of CALEA: ‚ÄúMobile carriers must provide the means for imperceptible ‚Äî that is, hidden from the subscriber ‚Äî listening to conversations).  Considering that the original presentation considered here is posted on the Internet at <u><a href="http://transition.fcc.gov/pshs/images/CALEAPresentation20Mar08dow2.ppt">transition.fcc.gov/pshs/images/CALEAPresentation20Mar08dow2.ppt</a></u> , it can be assumed that the CALEA bill is the fruit of the activities of the Federal Communications Agency <sup>1</sup> (FCC, Federal Commission Commission) .  It becomes clear that the FCC's responsibilities include not only the frequency allocation policy among cellular providers (for example, AT &amp; T), checking the radio emission level of cellular devices, but also CALEA compatibility control of both these providers and mobile communications devices.  Any current American smartphone must pass the FCC compliance check procedure.  Keep this in mind when ordering the latest model gadget from the United States. <br><br>  The presentation emphasizes: "CALEA has been around for quite some time," which means: the CALEA bill has been in force for about 14 years <sup>2</sup> , therefore any currently released network equipment manufactured for sale (as opposed to special orders from the US Government and the US State Department, which are obviously impossible to find on sale) is CALEA-compatible and has been for a known period of time.  Further it is directly stated: the FBI (FBI) and the US Federal Communications Agency (FCC) stand behind lobbying and enforcing the CALEA bill. <br><br><hr><br>  1 - The Federal Communications Agency is the ‚ÄúIndependent Government Agency of the United States, created, operated and authorized in accordance with the statute of the US Congress.‚Äù <br><br>  2 - The CALEA bill was adopted on October 25, 1994, during the presidency of Bill Clinton.  Thus, at the time of the preparation of the presentation (March 20, 2008), CALEA operated for 13 years 4 months 3 weeks and 3 days, or exactly 4895 days. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/133640/">https://habr.com/ru/post/133640/</a></p>
