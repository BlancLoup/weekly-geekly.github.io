In 2016, 800 people worked in the New Devices Group. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zd/1a/gs/zd1agsisqczs0uzbhcvcs5ccfh8.jpeg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Intel formed the New Devices Group division in 2013 with the goal of developing fitness trackers and smart glasses.  The company has invested several hundred million dollars in projects, bought external companies, but the team could not have a serious impact on the market of wearable devices.

      In 2014, Intel bought the developer of fitness trackers Basis Science, the company entered the New Devices Group.  The main product of the company was the Basis Band tracker.  Under the wing of Intel were created new smart watches Intel Basis Peak. <br><br>  During the first year since the start of sales, Basis Peak had a problem with overheating, the gadget could leave burns and blisters on the skin.  The problem could not be solved programmatically, and Intel had <a href="https://www.vedomosti.ru/technology/articles/2016/08/05/651837-intel-otzivaet-svoi-umnie-chasi-basis-peak-klientov">to withdraw</a> gadgets, reimbursing users the amount of the purchase: 234 US dollars in the US and 244 euros in Europe. <br><br>  In 2017, Intel <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/07/19/intel-eliminates-its-wearables-division-.html">has reduced</a> 80% of the staff responsible for developing fitness trackers.  The company decided to focus on augmented reality technology. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/t2/d-/ea/t2d-ea5ehb4bsi0xff1bxxfvuem.jpeg"><br><br>  In February 2018, Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-01/intel-is-said-to-plan-sale-of-majority-stake-in-ar-glasses-unit">wrote</a> about Intel‚Äôs plans to attract investment to develop the Vaunt smart glasses project.  According to sources, the company estimated the division at $ 350 million. <br><blockquote>  Intel is continuously working on new technologies and experiences.  Not all developments become the products we want to market.  The Superlight project [codename for Vaunt] is a prime example in which Intel showed different augmented reality glasses for consumers.  We will continue to invent and study new technologies and sometimes make tough choices when the market dynamics do not correspond to further investments. <br></blockquote><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Hidden text</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><blockquote>  Intel is continuously working on new technologies and experiences.  We choose to take to the market.  The Superlight [The Codename for Vaunt]  We‚Äôve been inventing and exploring new technologies. </blockquote></div></div><br>  Unlike smart glasses with futuristic design, the prototype of glasses from Intel looks like ordinary classic glasses.  Among the tasks that were solved by the developers, was to balance the weight of all parts of the gadget and achieve a total mass not exceeding 50 grams.  Glasses with a laser <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/297913/">transmit the image</a> directly to the retina.  At the beginning of 2018, experts from NDG told that the company plans to sell devices on the market for vision correction glasses - there are already 2.5 billion potential consumers there.  The company decided that people would buy Vaunt, as before - the usual points. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bnfwClgheF0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Until now, the division has not made successful products for the mass market.  At the same time, Intel has considerable experience in cooperation with other companies.  In 2016, sales of sunglasses from Intel and Oakley started with a built-in fitness tracker, watch manufacturer Tag Heuer released smart gadgets Connected Modular, a joint development with Intel and Google.  The journalist of The Verge Dieter Bohn believes that the reason for the closure of the Vaunt project could be the lack of a suitable partner for Intel with the corresponding sales opportunities and channels. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/371447/">https://habr.com/ru/post/371447/</a></p>
