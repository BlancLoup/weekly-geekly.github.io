  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Mobile programming: today and tomorrow</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Mobile phones appeared not so long ago and quickly began to crowd out the usual, stationary, but not far off the time when smartphones, whose market share has not yet <a href="http://www.gazeta.ru/news/business/2011/07/26/n_1940037.shtml">reached 50%</a> , will replace them, mobile and wireless. <br><br>  Programming for mobile phones will still be relevant for a couple of years, that's for sure.  Applications in this area are developed mainly in the Java 2 Platform Micro Edition (J2ME).  What are these applications?  The lion's share - all sorts of games.  This is the second most popular method of using your phone, after, of course, communication services. <br><br>  Next is the mobile Internet and all sorts of programs to facilitate the work with him.  For more advanced users, readers, email clients, instant messengers, i.e.  all that makes a regular phone as close as possible to a smartphone.

      Smartphones - here, of course, the field of activity, and the choice of platforms and tools are much wider, and this area looks much more promising.  The most popular are Java for Android and BlackBerry, Visual Basic and Visual C ++ for Windows CE, C / C ++ and OPL for Symbian, html5 / js for a wide variety of devices.  What categories of applications are popular for smartphones?  Yes, whatever!  Naturally, games, various readers, audio / video players, navigators, maps, diagrams, instant messengers, applications for traveling on the Internet and convenient use of social networks and so on and so forth. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Mobile phones are still "in the saddle", but apparently, most of the market one way or another <a href="http://www.vz.ru/economy/2011/7/26/510087.print.html">will take smartphones</a> . <br><br>  In addition to mobile phones, there are also tablet PCs.  They replace laptops and desktops rather than telephones, possessing practically all the functions of the former, but being many times more convenient during transportation and use. <br><br>  With the situation of today, everything is more or less clear.  And what awaits us tomorrow?  Will the usual PCs and laptops, pushed out by increasingly smart phones and tablets, go to the background? <br><br>  Already, smartphones can do much of what a regular PC user, who is not particularly demanding, can do, and even tablets can be used not only for entertainment, but also as a working tool for artists, editors, businessmen and other professionals. <br><br>  They no longer have a major drawback of the smartphone - a small screen, but there is a big advantage over a laptop - much less weight and convenience. <br><br>  This leads to the obvious conclusion that the use of smartphones will continue to develop more in the field of communications, the Internet, and entertainment, while tablet PCs will become for many users a full-fledged working tool, almost completely replacing a familiar computer or laptop. <br><br>  It is unlikely that smartphones can become a tool for working with graphic editors or a full-fledged player, but is it necessary at all?  The only foreseeable minus of tablets is that they are still not so comfortable to watch movies, and the designers will not be able to work with them, the designers will not be able to work at all.  But on the other hand, there will be more than enough for the needs of a businessman, a student, and a typical average PC tablet user. <br><br>  What are mobile apps tomorrow?  In order to try to assume that it expects mobile programming in the future, you can use the predictions for companies engaged in the production of mobile devices now.  Very many predict confident leadership <a href="http://www.wpcentral.com/wp7-overtake-android-2015">Android</a> . <br><br>  Indeed, Android has a lot of advantages: the presence of both expensive and budget devices, a lot of software development tools and ease of distribution, a lot of programmers are already writing for it, and even more of those who ‚Äúlook in his direction‚Äù.  With the launch of the Google+ service, interest only grows, because in this way Google provides closer integration of its own social services, the popularity of which is already high. <br><br>  Should I discard competitors?  Apple has a very strong place in its segment and has an army of loyal fans, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/innovationlab/blog/124257">Blackberry is gaining momentum in the development of tablet devices</a> and a wider range of smartphones, Nokia and Samsung are still ‚Äúin the arena‚Äù.  But what will happen tomorrow - will the rivals allow Android to continue holding the first positions? <br><br>  Summarizing, we can conclude that tomorrow mobile programming will continue to actively use Java (Android, BlackBerry), C / C ++, ObjectiveC, and J2ME will definitely be in demand.  The html5 / js bundle, most often with webkit extensions, has gained serious acceptance.  Suffice it to recall web-based products such as Phonegap and Titanium.  The degree of interest on the part of developers in applying html5 is very high, which is confirmed by the <a href="http://www.appcelerator.com/company/survey-results/mobile-developer-report-july-2011/">Apccelerator / IDC</a> report for the third quarter of the current year. <br><br> <a href="http://fotki.yandex.ru/users/audiotec/view/490077/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/97f/93c/85c/97f93c85c64154e1805638acf5c7deec.gif" width="627" height="559"></a> <br><br> <a href="http://fotki.yandex.ru/users/audiotec/view/490411/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0c3/db5/94e/0c3db594e63627adea373aac695c82dc.gif" width="646" height="800"></a> <br><br>  Flash / Flex has quite good prospects, this statement is true for a variety of platforms and operating systems: iOS, Android, Samsung Bada, Blackberry Tablet OS and Blackberry OS of future versions. <br><br>  From the directions of the created programs will, as before, lead games, instant messengers, tools for working with the Internet, reading rooms, media.  But it will also make a big leap, due to the gradual ousting of stationary PCs by mobile, to the area of ‚Äã‚Äãsoftware, which is still customarily used on dextros - tools for enhanced work with texts and images, programming possibilities, all kinds of office programs.  ‚ÄúDesktop‚Äù software is already migrating to ‚Äúcloud‚Äù services, such as Apple iCloud.  Popularity will be preserved and will continue to be improved by purely ‚Äúmobile‚Äù applications - various geolocation tools, communications, communications, mobile television.  There are also great prospects for <a href="http://www.melochey.net/mobilnaya-kommerciya.html">mobile commerce</a> . <br><br>  What do you think about the priority directions in the creation of mobile applications?  Perhaps you have a different opinion on this?  Let us take this opportunity to remind you of the <a href="http://www.innovationlab.ru/60-innovatsionnaya-laboratoriya-prodlevaet-konkurs.html">competition now underway</a> - if you have a great idea for a mobile application - there is still time to take part in the competition! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/126095/">https://habr.com/ru/post/126095/</a></p>
