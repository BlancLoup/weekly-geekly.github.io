Gift version</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><blockquote>  <i>Male dialogue in one action</i> </blockquote><br>  Remember the poem?  Who was sitting on the bench, who was looking at the street, Tolya sang, Boris was silent, Nikolay shook his foot ... In our company there is Tolya, a life doctor and a restaurateur in the shower, system administrator Misha, programmer of the language S Ivan, builder Maxim, doctors Ilya and Stas and I am an engineer with an airborne boss and birthday on February 23rd.  We gathered to watch a couple of new films, and then we talked about plans for February 23, about how to rest, and not deprive friends, and engage in children, and about the sore point - gifts.  What a pain, what a pain, the score of socks is something useful five-zero. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/56b/b71/e51/56bb71e5128c0815c32135a3ca9bf510.jpg"></div><a name="habracut"></a><br>  - My son and I have big plans for February 23.  He is at least 7 years old, but already a business man, his boy in the subject.  We will set up a 3D printer and learn to make asterisks and primitive tanks, and then we will reach the soldiers.  Drawings together came up with - he drew, I designed - in vain that a builder.  Our dream for two came true - the <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/3d-printers-3d-printer-kits/pp_428456.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">Anet A6 3D printer</a> and a bunch of consumables for it.  Of course, it is worth a lot - $ 218.40, but it's worth it.  And it will not take a lot of space - in general, there is already a lesson for spring break. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c1d/54b/4ec/c1d54b4ec5c4fe35f3a7d1750c6ab811.jpg"></div><br>  - And I, guys, won the jackpot, and a double gift to me.  My birthday is on February 23, so I chose a couple of options on <a href="http://ru.gearbest.com/promotion--special-1173.html%3F22777%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17"><b>Gearbest</b></a> and carefully hinted at the democratic election of my gift.  The first, of course, <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/cell-phones/pp_446767.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">Lenovo Moto Z Play</a> .  Firstly, this is a moto - I remember, at my institute, the first one had a folding RAZR, thin and colorful, liked to carry it in the breast pocket of the jacket and it is important to slam it after talking.  It was stylish and expensive.  Everyone thought that my parents bought me, and then I stretched the net in one office, set everything up for them, instructed the antiviruses - it was enough for me just on my Motor Walker.  Then the girls went with mini-phones, I don‚Äôt even remember the brand, and at recess we laughed that soon there would be fewer fingers on the phones.  And they are a little less than a shovel. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/724/147/a57/724147a5737b8568a75f27273a59b401.jpg"></div><br>  And now, Lenovo launches Moto right on the Snapdragon 625 - 8 cores, 5.5-inch display, 3 gigabytes of RAM, 64 gigabytes of internal memory, the sixth Android.  Yes, I am weaker computers admin!  By the way, it is still important to me that the camera is 16 megapixel and the battery is 3510 mAh.  I need for bike trips. <br>  - And the second candidate? <br>  - Second - <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/cell-phones/pp_592336.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">OnePlus 3T 4G Phablet</a> , unrealistically cool.  RAM 6 gigs, six!  Built-in 64GB memory, 5.5 inches, just under my paw, cool glass, a powerful Snapdragon 821 processor and a 16 megapixel camera, it is important for me to have it at hand to work.  And do not sit down with such TTX - the battery is already 3400 mAh, a hundred pounds for a day is enough.  It costs $ 459.99, and with an OPTGBS coupon, it does $ 448.99.  Ten bucks is not superfluous!

But socks.  Which I can safely buy.  And then requires a creative approach to farming.  I agree to dig - judging by my wife and mother-in-law, part of the peasant farmer in Russian women has not undergone evolution.  That is, so we dig in the old fashioned way, but to the music from aytyuns in a wireless column.  Yes, I do not mind digging, peasant hands are always needed, but then what?  That's right, we eat pre-cooked sandwiches.  And then again sandwiches, tea from a thermos and behind the wheel, corks to do.  Well, why not linger a little longer and cook a normal meal?  Barbecue, for example.  Under the chill ... well, or lemonade for those who are driving. <br>  - About you, Toll, they even joked in KVN: ‚ÄúEven with a small IQ you can make a barbecue‚Äù.  It‚Äôs time to go in for sports, you‚Äôll not have a car with a barbecue and grill soon. <br>  - What are all sparkling.  But in nature, always ask for everything and fry the meat and cool the beer.  Immediately Tolya is the most important, without Tolik there will be no table. <br>  - Remember you, how did you cool the foam and threw it into the river?  That's probably pike drunk. <br>  - Here!  And in this case, I have already found everything.  <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/other-car-gadgets/pp_333253.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">Refrigerator HUANJIE</a> 12V, can be powered from the cigarette lighter.  Capacity - 7.5 liters, we can shove all the drinks there.  You can also switch to hot mode and take hot food for a winter ski trip, for example.  Issue price - $ 32.25. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/416/51b/e76/41651be768db47be412b16c689c63449.jpg"></div><br><br>  - That's why I love you, Tolik, I love you, so much for your ingenious engineering approach.  Pikes will not be drunk, goodness. <br>  - Wan, why are you silent?  In the eyes of all the grief of the Russian people. <br>  - And I love February 23.  My son is happy - for 10 years now, and he really arranges delicious breakfasts for the second year on holidays.  But the wife does not forget that the man‚Äôs day gives shower gels - I can no longer clean myself, but wash the whole pig complex.  And the really expensive gives - and such and those.  As if I‚Äôm some kind of stylish producer, not a programmer sishnik.  Last year, presented a case for the phone.  Previous, aha.  And then it begins: surf the shelf, podklej, the socket hangs.  And I have all the tools in the garage, I drag it back and forth, constantly losing. <br>  - And you leave the page open for her on your home laptop. <br>  - Page of what? <br>  - And here, look, what an interesting thing from Xiaomi - what only they do not do!  <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/screwdriver-screwdriver-set/pp_576093.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">Electric screwdriver</a> for different types of screws.  Cover half of your needs, including your passion for upgrading your own laptop.  And here's another coupon for it, WowstickS - vzhuh!  - and the price is $ 33.99. <br>  - Yeah, I suppose, again, this wild gun with a bunch of nozzles in an uncomfortable body, with which you walk like a cowboy Joe in the saloon. <br>  - Yes, look you, skeptic year.  Durable LED backlit case, 6 bits in a neat case, aluminum case.  It seems to me that the grip should be comfortable - like a familiar screwdriver.  Bits on the magnet, you can twist as automatic, and mechanically with your hands.  And only $ 36.99. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bbf/2fe/3a7/bbf2fe3a7c4d8e32d903ffa729ca687b.jpg"></div><br>  It seems to me that the price is more than adequate.  And then there is the case - nothing is lost, everything has its own cell.  And what do you give to your son, Ivan? <br>  - For small things, I have already ordered a <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/rc-cars/pp_351315.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">supercar WLtoys</a> - a natural off-road vehicle with illumination, at a speed of up to 50 km / h, with a charge of 20 minutes. Waterproof and all-weather, almost like my ancient Toyota.  Well, we, of course, cheated, a gift like him, and we will play together.  Rather, the snow would have melted. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/100/58c/f06/10058cf06213da9f9bd69c6435fc5d2d.jpg"></div><br>  - Not fragile? <br>  - Yes, it does not break!  Cool suspension, with shock absorbers, a full reserve, plastic flexible and durable.  Cups, holders, drive, tips and central gimbal - all metal.  Chase!  Max, what did you cook for yours? <br>  - Well, it is already difficult to surprise me with something - a rider, like a Hollywood star.  He is keen on everyone in a row - the motor-bike row ... But what pleases me, finally began to be determined and reached out for robotics - all in me, an engineer, a builder of the future, one might say.  I want to test his skills on <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/block-toys/pp_571922.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">Xiaomi MITU</a> .  It costs $ 139.31, but I still got a coupon from MiturobotLB, with him the price is generally indecently low - $ 115.99. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c9b/b79/78b/c9bb7978b6eb0730b5146f8e7ff4cfa4.png"></div><br>  - A good designer? <br>  - I have not tried it yet, but I read the <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/gearbest/blog/283816/">review on Hiktames</a> .  You see, a conscious kid is still a child, and the passion for robots can be a one-time, well, or there until the first lesson in physics or chemistry.  Therefore, investing half a bucks in the famous set simply does not see the point.  It will go, we'll see.  And with this, and I will play in my free time. <br>  - I would start with this.  Well, once such a booze has gone - cut the last cucumber.  Find me a phone.  I do not want on February 23, just need a new one.  I killed the old man on duty - leaned over to the patient, the phone fell out of his pocket with a corner on the tile, all covered in a cobweb, the sensor triggered once.  Repair - more expensive than bury.  Just to not feed it from each outlet and about twenty thousand rubles, no more.  And yes, with a good screen and the Internet - to pass the night shifts. <br>  - Look, at my brother-in-law <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/cell-phones/pp_365119.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">Xiaomi Mi5</a> .  The powerful Snapdragon 820 percent, its proprietary shell, convenient, 3 GB of RAM and 32 GB of internal memory, the camera is generally fire.  The battery is again 3000 mAh, your day should stand.  Cover with me. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b3b/538/bdc/b3b538bdc6ad32f3bb9e1dfb5f0dd917.jpg"></div><br>  - So, it is $ 304.99, at the current rate it is about 18,000. Although nothing like that. <br>  - I have a coupon in stock - XIMIS, with it the price with a slight movement turns into $ 259.99. <br>  - Persuaded, I take. <br>  - If you need a portable charge, even look <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/power-banks/pp_492338.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">at Xiaomi's power bank</a> at 10,000 mAh, I have exactly one, indispensable on trips, it will come in handy on vacation.  And it is inexpensive, I took more expensive. <br>  - And I, men, have already ordered everything - grandfather and test. <br>  - Ilyukh, and the test-what?  Repeller in-law? <br>  - Oh, you, he is my world - Mazu always pulls me, always under cover.  He is still a fisherman for me: fishing him all, fishing rods, silence and no one around.  Bought him: I - <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/fishing-reels-and-rods/pp_353623.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">spinning TSP2000 Trulinoya is</a> so serious for $ 79.08, my wife found it, think for it.  She has been familiar with Gearbest for a year now, she orders all kinds of things for herself.  Last year I had <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/backpacks/pp_436960.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">a Tigernu T backpack for my</a> birthday - a convenient, durable, anti-vandal for laptop and for small things.  For the year I did not get dirty, I did not lose my look.  Now $ 37.28 is worth it. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"> <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/fishing-reels-and-rods/pp_353623.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d21/328/adc/d21328adc57a21970b799506d9dd09bc.jpg"></a> </div><br>  - A grandfather? <br>  - He is my war veteran, but he is more cheerful than you and me, pah-pah.  But the breather is not the same, asked for pressure apparatus with large numbers and measurement memory.  Chose a <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/home-appliances/pp_260222.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">tonometer JDS-800</a> for $ 40.60, the cuff is wide and durable. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"> <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/home-appliances/pp_260222.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bbc/50d/d22/bbc50dd22400ba0dc128fa2e75279ade.jpg"></a> </div><br>  - Guys, and we have a former airborne boss boss, world man.  Colleagues wanted another pen or brandy, we and the admins gathered all my thoughts in reserve, threw off 10 bucks from the nose, and that's what we thought up - we already got a <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/smart-watches/pp_425592.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">Garmin vivoactive smart watch</a> for him.  He is in the gym such workouts figachit - not hijacking, and all without a bracelet. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"> <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/smart-watches/pp_425592.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/acb/518/c86/acb518c86bf3d0f177d8bd9629a33ee4.jpg"></a> </div><br>  And in our watch and GPS for running, and monitor heart rate, and support for different training modes, and a pedometer, and much more.  And most importantly, the belt is firmly fastened with a classic buckle - no ever lost clips to you. <br><br>  - Well, let's get together on the 23rd, congratulations, let's drink to love, friendship and military service? <br>  - For a majority vote. <br>  - No, men, you think that our something about us say. <br>  - I am sure that only good. <br><br>  All the characters and events of the story are invented, but it is about this that colleagues at work sometimes say, doctors on duty, and friends in traffic.  Guys are men.  They always know what they want, practical and realistic.  But they love women and children, ready to help and support in any situation.  Attention to them takes not so much time and effort - you just have to <a href="http://ru.gearbest.com/promotion--special-1173.html%3F22777%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">take care of the gift</a> in advance and choose something less trivial.
