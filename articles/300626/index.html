Simple modeling and algorithmization</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <b>For whom this article:</b> First of all, for managers, managers and all others who do not belong to the class of developers, but nevertheless have to communicate with them and encounter misunderstanding when setting goals for developing an ERP or online store, automated control systems, etc. <br><br>  It may also be useful to the developers themselves as a mini FAQ for communicating with those who have not had the honor to ‚Äúnakodit‚Äù at least a couple of lines in their lives. <br><br>  The main motivation for the implementation of this or similar FAQ formulation of the problem is very simple and is vividly and clearly understood in the form of cash.  Good programmers are expensive, and not developed tasks take a lot of time to clarify, fix, etc., which leads to tangible financial losses.

Add related products. <br>  If a customer buys, say, an audio player, do not forget to offer him a headset, a case, a memory card, etc. <br>  2. Similar products. <br>  At this point, we play for promotion.  If the player chosen by the client is worth 5tr.  We need to offer him a more expensive option with more features. <br>  This is the minimum of what needs to be done at this stage. </blockquote><br><br>  Suppose we have an online store and we don‚Äôt have the functionality of ‚Äúsimilar products‚Äù according to the described scheme, and we want to assign the task to our development department.  The task sets the head of sales. <br><br>  <b>The first thing to start with is to formulate your Wishlist as precisely as possible:</b> <br><br>  In the product card, for example, let's take an audio player, a block should be displayed with similar products, namely goods belonging to the same product group, but at a price not lower than the product being viewed.  The same should be displayed in the shopping cart next to the item. <br><br>  Take and draw on a piece of paper, and it is better to print a screenshot from the item card and draw on it what it should look like. <br>  It would seem that everything, but it is better to take and draw a logic diagram. <br><br>  This can be done on a piece of paper or in Visio included in the Office package. <br><br>  <b>To draw a scheme is simple, you will see it now, draw it:</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6c2/190/19e/6c219019eb0949b4ad49f6883a235678.jpg"><br><br>  The boxes on the top are the raw data or the result of the decision. <br><br>  Diamonds are the decision to make, YES or NO, a logical action. <br><br>  So, we have the price of the original product, the original group and the original product itself.  Further, according to our idea, we make a sample from the product group identical to the original one and the price is higher than the original product.  And then immediately stop, as far as the goods that we offer as an alternative, can be higher than the original?  After all, if we offer a buying player for 5tr and a top model for 50tr, he is unlikely to pay attention to it.  But if you offer an option, say, for 6-7, well, up to 10tr, then perhaps the customer will choose the option and more expensive, respectively, will bring greater profit to the store. <br><br>  The first thing that comes to mind is to limit the threshold "not more than twice."  Now in what order to build the track of the proposals in the item card?  It makes no sense to start with the most expensive, it is more logical if the client starts to compare models, and does not get frightened at once by a high price.  But also offering models at a price of 5020 rubles, that is, at a little more expensive, is also absent, the number of similar products is limited, say, 5pcs (no longer fits).  From here, one more condition is added, "no more than twice, but not less than 10% -20%." <br><br>  <b>We finish the model:</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0c2/737/94c/0c273794cefe4008b738a8ac1f1c9b5b.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Already more interesting.</b>  But stop again.  And we can show only 5pcs of goods, but what is their price step?  That is, the original player is priced at 5000r and other 5550r., 5505r, etc.  That is a lot of goods, and we need to show different and only 5 pieces.  We think: we have the maximum level twice, that is 200%, the minimum 20%, that is, we need to divide this chain into 5 parts and approximately evenly. <br><br>  <b>Having thought and estimated the</b> statistics of sales, the movement of the buyer on goods, etc.  do so, for example, 20% - 60% - 100% - 150% - 200%.  Excellent, but it is with this price that is, that is, + 200% may not be, therefore, it is necessary to lay down the fact that we choose the closest one that is most suitable for the price, that is, + \ -. <br><br>  <b>It seems to have taken everything into account, once again we think over all the nuances ...</b> There is one more, and what if the product from the sample is not available?  That it clearly should not be shown, we add this condition. <br><br>  <b>We draw modelka:</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7c8/219/144/7c82191448b04d6aa0f399a2185e16d1.jpg"><br><br>  <b>What else can happen?</b>  Well, for example, the product in the sample may not be at all, or it will not be 5 but say 2 or 3. In this case, we display what is, if there is no suitable product at all, we display the closest one or the product from a similar group.  If we do not like it, then we can not display the block at all, but this is not gud. <br><br>  <b>Add these conditions:</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/31e/d95/943/31ed959435c140e49d510d7eb93d97cd.jpg"><br><br>  <b>It seems all visible options are provided.</b> <br><br>  Now we compose everything in a bunch.  We take our leaf with the image of the insert into the product card and the basket, add the scheme and formulate the scheme with the text: <br><br>  Add the block "similar products" to the product card and the basket, according to the schematic drawing. <br><br>  <b>The logic of work in the scheme and the text:</b> <br><br>  The text will be training, I think it will not be difficult to write it yourself. <br><br>  <b>PS</b> <br><br>  Add in the comments what nuances I could have missed and does this option suit you as a developer from the category better than before? <br><br>  <a href="https://yadi.sk/d/HUv5MIX4rWxMH"><b>Download the scheme in Visio Yandex disk</b></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/300626/">https://habr.com/ru/post/300626/</a></p>
