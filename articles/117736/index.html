  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Mobile Shopping List</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good afternoon, habravchane! <br><br>  My name is Alexander <s>and I am a startup ...</s> and I have a problem with shopping and shopping lists! <br>  Since I often spend time in supermarkets armed with a huge shopping list for the whole family, its convenience for me is a very important issue.  But, as a rule, this list is compiled on a random piece of paper and represents chaos!  Goods are disordered, written haphazardly, sometimes it is even difficult to disassemble what is written.  So, I lose a lot of time shopping with such an awkward list! <br>  There is really another option: throw sms.  The phone is always with me and there, of course, everything will be clearly written.  But the question remains with ordering.  All the goods are also dumped in the general pile and as a result you need to stand in front of the cash register, study the list and check whether you put everything in the cart.  That is, extra time is spent again. <br>  In general, I got sick of it all, and I decided to make <a href="http://shopliiist.ru/">my shopping list</a> , with blackjack and you-know-who, convenient and mobile. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Mobile paper list replacement </h4><br>  For the user, almost nothing changes: instead of writing everything on a piece of paper, he enters the site and also, comma-delimitedly, enters the list of products into the form. <br><br> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/alex-and-r/5631544285/" title="list_add by alex-and-r, on Flickr"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1c1/922/975/1c1922975ac5916d59797c608fa4a40f.jpg" width="500" height="313" alt="list_add"></a> 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      The script scatters the products in the departments of the store.  This is one of the two main features of my project.  <b>The list is sorted by itself!</b>  Well, if some kind of purchase got in the wrong place, you can simply drag it to the necessary department with the mouse, the program will remember this and never make a mistake in sorting. <br><br> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/alex-and-r/5631496311/" title="list by alex-and-r, on Flickr"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/41e/0b7/2df/41e0b72dfc6154566a92a5a9e6ac4798.jpg" width="500" height="313" alt="list"></a> <br><br>  Then you can choose the store where you are going to go, and the departments will be sorted as they are located in this store.  This is actually the second feature of this project: if the <b>departments in the list are arranged the same way as they go in the store</b> , then along with moving around the store you will smoothly move through the list, rather than scanning it from end to end in search of that department where are you now with a cart. <br><br> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/alex-and-r/5632079606/" title="shop_change by alex-and-r, on Flickr"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bd2/773/246/bd2773246eae6afb4014bbf27f1b340d.jpg" width="500" height="313" alt="shop_change"></a> <br><br>  Divisions, like products, can also be re-sorted by drag and drop. <br><br> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/alex-and-r/5632079690/" title="shop_edit by alex-and-r, on Flickr"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c0c/343/efb/c0c343efb8f75c01e83eb0b7046c19d4.jpg" width="500" height="313" alt="shop_edit"></a> <br><br>  As a result, in the store, going to the same site from a mobile phone, the user receives a list of purchases distributed by department, and the departments are arranged in the order in which they are located in the store. <br><br>  Total?  Save time! <br><br>  That's all.  :) <i>Bye for now</i> . <br><br><h4>  In the plans </h4><ul><li>  the possibility of offline use of the site through the appCache and localStorage mechanisms, </li><li>  release of native applications for popular mobile platforms with enhanced functionality, </li><li>  introduction of the ability to add to the list by mail and SMS, </li><li>  increase the base stores </li><li>  help the user in drawing up lists, </li><li>  and much more! </li></ul>  In a word, welcome!  I would be glad if not only this <a href="http://shopliiist.ru/">mobile shopping list</a> will help me to spend less time in supermarkets!  :) <br><br>  <b>By postscriptum I want to add 2 comments:</b> <ul><li>  I have already discussed this project with many people and realized that its potential user is still not a young energetic programmer, who sometimes drops into the store to buy something on the little things, but a parent who is sent to shop for the whole family.  Well, the more interesting it will be to hear the responses of the first group, to enter, so to speak, right into the thick of it!  :) </li><li>  And yes, I know that I am not the first!  :) At the bottom of the label and anyone can see analogues.  Well, so what?  Competition is great! </li></ul><br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> The site moved to its own domain: <a href="http://shopliiist.ru/">shopliiist.ru</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/117736/">https://habr.com/ru/post/117736/</a></p>
