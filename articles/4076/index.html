  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Intelligence services are being introduced into social networks</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The person who first opened the pages of a dating site or a social network will simply be shocked by the amount of private information that people voluntarily publish about themselves.  Social networks are a real find for special services.  As it became known to the magazine New Scientist, the US intelligence agencies are already <a href="">seriously developing this topic</a> .  Research in this area is funded by the US National Security Agency. <br><br>  Research is conducted in the field of mass automatic collection of private information that people publish on their pages on social networks.  At the same time, there is a search for ways to use the technology of the so-called ‚ÄúSemantic Network‚Äù to integrate information from social networks into a database with information on bank accounts (including account movements) and information on property ownership.  In the same system, you can integrate the movement history of a person (this information is available from cellular networks) and other information.  If such a system is implemented, the National Security Agency will be able to generate a detailed dossier on any citizen of the country. <br><br>  After September 11, 2001, the National Security Agency received expanded powers to monitor the private life of citizens.  Their powers allow, for example, to listen to the records of telephone conversations.  If we analyze the list of phone calls of a person for a specified period of time, then we can make an approximate network of his contacts.  This is very important information, because it allows you to analyze how close a person is to this or that illegal formation.

      Analysis of phone calls allows you to make only a fairly approximate scheme.  Thanks to the Internet, intelligence officers wish to expand the information base. <br><br>  To date, to compile a comprehensive information base for all Internet users is a rather difficult task, because the information on the Web is presented in a variety of formats that are incompatible with each other.  This trouble is planned to be eliminated in the future when the standards of the Semantic Web become widespread, including the common format of the data structure Resource Description Framework (RDF), where each type of information receives its own individual tag.  These standards are actively promoted by the W3C consortium. <br><br>  In fact, RDF turns the World Wide Web into one large and distributed spreadsheet with standard cells.  You only need to access the information and learn how to handle it.  This is exactly what the researchers, who are paid by the National Security Agency, are now busy with.  At the end of May 2006, at the WWW2006 conference, they spoke about their successes, presenting a report entitled <a href="http://www2006.org/programme/files/pdf/4068.pdf">‚ÄúSemantic Analysis of Social Networks‚Äù</a> (PDF file).  The research indicates that the research is partially funded by some organization called the Advanced Research Development Activity (ARDA).  In fact, ARDA was recently renamed the Disruptive Technology Office and is a division of the National Security Agency for Advanced Research Funding.  One of the challenges facing Disruptive Technology Office Office is to find a way to organize huge amounts of information that flow to an agency, which is about 4 petabytes per month. <br><br>  The flow of information is constantly increasing.  The largest social networks on the Internet, for example, <a href="http://www.myspace.com/">MySpace</a> , now contain detailed information about 80 million people, and this number is constantly growing.  Intelligence agencies simply can not cope with the processing of such a stream. <br><br>  The authors of the work ‚ÄúSemantic Analysis of Social Networks‚Äù have created a system for automatically processing RDF tags from social networks, with similar information from other Internet systems.  In the future, such a system will allow to combine multiple sources of information. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4076/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4076/</a></p>
