In this review, only foreign (mainly from the US market) solutions, and for residents of Russia (and CIS countries), we suggest using our designer <a href="http://appropio.com/">appropio.com</a> , which is made taking into account the specifics of our market.  If you digress a little, then designers take root very badly in Russia.  In our memory, two were closed - myapps &amp; getshopapp, although our development experience for the order shows that very few small and medium businesses can afford to make an application for 500,000+ rubles, keeping in mind the hypotheses for many to return the invested funds that have not been tested (although we observed sales of $ 5,000,000 per day from the mobile applications of the fashion segment).  We will write a separate article for Habr with attempts to answer the question: why the best foreign designers did not “take off” in our market later, what we plan to do for the opposite :) and so on.  It seems that the main role here is played by our mentality ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  When we chose the best services for creating mobile applications, we were looking for solutions that allow us to create applications of a more or less professional level without having to use any programming skills.  At the same time, we focused on key features such as the availability of ready-made templates, the ability to send push notifications, integration with social networks, the work of geo-services, loyalty programs, mobile commerce support tools, personalization settings, and suitability for creating applications for devices based on the platform Android, iPhone and iPad.  In addition, the application creation services we needed should have been designed for beginners and have features useful for using apps in the retail industry. <br><br>  The best designer of mobile applications for small businesses in general: “Goodbarber” ( <a href="https://www.goodbarber.com/">GoodBarber</a> ).

      "Goodbarber" is the most valuable for those who are engaged in small business.  It is worth using this constructor is not expensive at all, and its tools and instruments can be used without restrictions.  We also like that Goodbarber is very easy to use and allows you to create excellent multi-functional mobile applications for all varieties of business.  In addition, Goodbarber provides access to the program code, components (additional modules) and programming interfaces of your application, so that you can completely individualize the application, focusing on the specific needs of your business.  Based on our experience, we can say that Goodbarber also has an excellent, very useful customer support system. <br><br>  The best designer of mobile applications for beginners: “Buildfire” ( <a href="https://buildfire.com/">BuildFire</a> ). <br><br>  Designer "Bildfire" allows you to create professional-looking mobile applications in a short time, without requiring the use of any technical skills.  It was so easy to use that it took us less than 10 minutes to create an account, and then our first application.  We like the fact that this constructor simplifies the process of creating mobile applications: first, you choose and customize the design and operation of the application according to personal preferences, then you can easily add content using widgets (interface elements).  We also liked the fact that in “Bildfire” there is an option to preview the application on your device - this is an additional advantage, which most designers in creating applications for entry-level users are deprived of. <br><br>  The best designer of mobile applications for the retail sector: MobiCart. <br><br>  Mobicard is a well-established mobile application designer, designed to help those who are engaged in retail sales, so that they go into a “mobile” trading environment and increase sales volumes through the use of mobile commerce.  It will save your time, as it allows you to automatically create an electronic storefront-interface for mobile devices by synchronizing it with the main store site, downloading a .csv file or using its own Mobicart application programming interface.  Thus, you can integrate a large number of third-party solutions (additional components) and mobile payment systems into your application, and your customers can make purchases directly through the application.  Among other useful features are sending out push notifications, services of geolocation services and the ability to transfer necessary information from your social networks to the application. <br><br>  <b>Our methods</b> <br><br>  To set the parameters for our sample of the best mobile application designers for small businesses, we began by compiling a list of sources that we already knew about.  Including those who praised and were mentioned by individual entrepreneurs, and those that were included in such lists on authoritative review sites and Internet resources for business people. <br><br>  Then we reduced the list to a minimum, paying attention to the types of designers of mobile applications, the characteristic key functions, various uses in various situations, as well as a large number of other indicators (they are detailed below).  To make it easier to sort the application designers and select the best of them, we asked individual entrepreneurs, business consultants and application developers what is required from such a service, what features they can characterize on the positive side, as well as what they like or I do not like the designers that they are currently using or have used before.  Additionally, for better understanding, we specified directly in the companies involved in the development of application designers, how different types of such designers work and how they differ from each other. <br><br>  In order to better determine the final position, we contacted sales representatives of various mobile application designers and teams from the customer support services, seeming as individual entrepreneurs who are planning to create their own application.  This allowed us to sort out what questions to ask about each application development designer, and at the same time assess the quality of customer support services.  In addition, as part of our research, we independently tested these mobile application designers.  Thanks to getting personal experience, it turned out to be easier for us to understand how simple designers really are to use, how their basic functions work and whether the prices correspond to their level of quality. <br><br>  As a result, we have a list, which includes dozens of mobile application designers.  Our favorites were Gudbarber, Bildfire and Mobikart, and the final list included AppyPie, Como (AppMachine), EpMcr (AppMakr), " Shautam ”(ShoutEm),“ Ichskape ”(EachScape),“ Mobile Roadi ”(Mobile Roadie) and Appery.io.  When evaluating each application development service, we took into account the following characteristics: <br><br>  <i>cost,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>ease of use</i> <i><br></i>  <i>ability to customize</i> <i><br></i>  <i>ability to send push notifications,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>availability of loyalty programs for regular customers,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>availability of geo-targeting services</i> <i><br></i>  <i>features of integration with social networks,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>the ability to work on the principle of "one click"</i> <i><br></i>  <i>features of the use of cards</i> <i><br></i>  <i>ability to preview on various devices,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>application management tools</i> <i><br></i>  <i>integration features with third-party applications,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>features of analytical work and presentation of information,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>support / customer service features</i> <br><br>  Next, we will try to briefly describe what each mobile application designer can offer (the list is compiled in alphabetical order, the leaders of our sample are also present in it): <br><br>  Epp Factory (App Factory) - Does Content Decide?  Epp Factory automatically “pulls out” information directly from your website, so that you can get a ready-made mobile application five minutes after the start of work.  Just enter the website address with “www” or URL, upload your logo, select colors - and you're done.  The work of Epp Factory is based on the application of an individual, simple and effective principle of building an application.  This constructor is easy to use and allows you to transfer information directly to your users' mobile devices when the application is launched.  mippin.com/appfactory <br><br>  app.cat - Do you have your own marketing agency?  Application designer app.cat will help you build applications for mobile devices specifically designed for commercial enterprises, musical groups, celebrities and other customers.  Unlike the vast majority of app development services, app.cat is distributed via text messages, social networks, and push notifications, which gives you greater independence and avoids many problems, including downtime that occurs when an application is distributed through online app stores .  app.cat <br><br>  AppBuilderOnline.com - Designed to meet the needs of small businesses, AppBuilderOnline.com is designed to make it easy to develop mobile applications for mobile devices and make them accessible.  It also allows you to perform all the routine work of registering a mobile application, when you need to submit an application for its placement in application stores, and fully use customer support services regardless of the size and peculiarities of the service fee.  appbuilderonline.com <br><br>  Appery.io - Appery.io is the only “drag-and-drag and drop” cloud-based platform with a set of visual development tools and integrated server services.  You work directly in the cloud, where you do not need to install or download anything, respectively, it is easier to create and run the application.  Also, Appery.io provides skillful developers with the chance to use advanced functionality.  appery.io <br><br>  “App Machines” - Using the “Epmashins” service is an economical way to create a professional full-featured mobile application on your own or with the help of design designers.  There are three ways to do this.  The easiest and fastest way is to analyze your existing website and import the information contained therein into an application for iOS, Android and Windows Phone platforms.  You can also start from scratch using the previously created structural elements of the platform, or use the services of the Epmashin developer, who will create an application for you.  appmachine.com <br><br>  EpMcr (AppMakr) - One of our favorites, the designer of mobile applications, EpMcr is a free, do-it-yourself platform for creating reliable HTML5 Internet applications and special applications for iOS and Android, and without any programming elements.  With the help of "Epmac" entrepreneurs can create as many first-class mobile applications as they wish, with an unlimited number of free updates.  The list of main features includes the use of push notifications, HTML5 functionality, high resolution photo banks, automatic updates, as well as the possibility of customizing the design and structure of the application.  Unlike the vast majority of other services for creating applications, EpMcr provides you with complete independence - you can publish your application under your own brand without reference to EpMcr.  appmakr.com <br><br>  Epnotch (AppNotch) - Sometimes all that is needed to create a mobile application is a site on the Internet.  Epnotch allows entrepreneurs to easily convert their existing websites into iOS, Android, and HTML5 applications.  You just need to enter the URL and select the type of construction execution of the application.  The content is automatically synchronized, so you do not have to constantly move from site to application and back to make current changes.  appnotch.com <br><br>  appsbar - appsbar is a free mobile application builder for devices on Android, iOS, Windows Phone and BlackBerry platforms.  It not only allows you to create mobile applications, but also facilitates the possibility of their promotion in app stores, on social networks and on your own online trading platform.  Also, this service has additional advantages - for example, if necessary, you can use the help of developers.  appsbar.com <br><br>  Epsms (Appsme) - Epsms is another easy-to-use designer for creating mobile applications with both free and paid tools and features.  The company says: if you can create a page on Facebook, then you can create a mobile application in Epsmi.  We like this constructor, because it also has advanced features and capabilities for advanced developers, and you can completely personalize your mobile application for the needs of a particular business.  appsme.com <br><br>  "Eppie Pie" (Appy Pie) - "Eppi Pie", one of our finalists, is a designer of mobile applications for iOS, Android, Windows Phone and BlackBerry platforms using the "drag and drop and release" principle.  Eppy Pay applications contain a complete set of key tools to support communication with customers, such as sending out push notifications, integration with social networks and blogs, access to photo banks and shared tools.  Some business tools are also available, such as an event planner, a restaurant management toolbox, GPS tracking and a shortcut.  appypie.com <br><br>  Bizness Apps - Business Eps is a mobile application designer that is suitable for use in almost all small business sectors, including restaurant business, music and sports, real estate, law, non-profit and even religious services.  You can choose from hundreds of customizable templates and features like push notifications, GPS, information exchange, social networking, mobile shopping baskets, mobile reservation services and food ordering, personalized email samples, mailing lists and much more.  biznessapps.com <br><br>  "Bildfire" (BuildFire) - The best of the best, in our opinion, the designer to create mobile applications for beginners.  "Bildfire" allows you to "mount" a professional-looking mobile application in minutes.  The user-friendly interface simplifies the process of creating an application, and in the course of your work you will not need any, even the simplest, coding skill.  Personalization options are also available - the result of your efforts will be a unique application that differs from ordinary analogs created with the help of similar designers. <br><br>  “Canves” - With the help of “Canves” “Applications and Business Models”, you can turn existing data presentation forms into models prepared for use on mobile devices in digital format, avoiding the problems and inconveniences that accompany the design of information manually.  Canves-using entrepreneurs create their own mobile applications that allow you to use all sorts of time-saving techniques — for example, automate workflow, calculate estimates and purchase orders, track products (using GPS), and confirm or provide access when entering a signature.  In addition, Canvies applications allow mobile payments to be made, monitored using the barcode scanning method and referenced with various databases.  gocanvas.com <br><br>  Como (Como) - we like the Como application designer because it makes it easier to create professional-looking applications, and you can use a collection of themes, colors, icons, layouts, styles, and backgrounds.  Also here is a number of means that will help conduct business.  You can use the setting for accepting mobile payments (MyCheck), allow customers to leave orders directly in the application with the function Online Ordering, track the delivery of their orders using Bringg.  In addition, Como has a variety of distribution and promotion services for the promotion of your application.  como.com <br><br>  ISccape (EachScape) - Our next favorite Ichskape is the designer of creating mobile applications of the “drag and drop and release” type, in which users can create customized, high-quality applications for iOS, Android and HTML5.   «»   ,     «»   (    HTML5)    ,    , push-,            (   «», «»  «-»).  «»           , , -  -,       ,        . eachscape.com <br><br> «» (GameSalad) — «»        ,    .          ,     .     «GameSalad Creator»     ,    «   »    ()   .                       ,   ,   . gamesalad.com <br><br> «» (GoodBarber) —             . «» — ,  ,     .       ,            ,  ,      ,     . <br><br> «» (MobiCart) — ,    ,       ,      .  «» —           .         ,           ,          ,      Android. <br><br> « » (Mobile Roadie) — « »    ,           . ,    ,    push-,   ,  ,          ,        ,   ,   ,              .       ,     : ,      ,    ,  ,   –        . mobileroadie.com <br><br> Salesforce1 Platform — ,   ,    «Salesforce1 Platform»,       , ,    .     «Salesforce1 Platform»   «»   ,    .              -,     ,   ,       . salesforce.com/platform/overview <br><br> «» (Taplytics) — «»        .     / ,       ,        ,           .             . «»   ,            -. taplytics.com <br><br> «» (Zengine) —                      .       «»       ,     .  «»            ,      -  ,    ,     ,     . zenginehq.com <br><br> Zoho Creator —  «Zoho Creator»         ,          .        «   »,        .    «Zoho Creator»   ,     ,           ,     .  ,            , ,            ,  ,      .      , ,  «» (PayPal),       . zoho.com/creator </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/323686/">https://habr.com/ru/post/323686/</a></p>
