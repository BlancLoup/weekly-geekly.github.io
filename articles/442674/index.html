(This cycle of articles will be of a purely technical nature, aimed at laboratory work, and not at PR of a resource. But we do not exclude that interest in this site may increase.) </li><li>  ‚ÄúImmediately, by the way, the community will receive a question, how ethical is it to describe solutions of other people's tasks and did we receive an acceptance of a similar series of articles from the authors of the resource?‚Äù <br>  (Unfortunately, but no, we are trying to get in touch with them through public email addresses. But there is no answer yet.) </li><li>  How often and how many articles are expected to be released?  (In plans to publish 2 more materials, with a video presentation. And further articles will be formed already from your wishes in the comments.) </li><li>  The site already has answers to labs and a description from the video.  Why then this article?  (Yes, everything is true. Such materials are present especially in old laboratory works. But unfortunately some of the study materials on the topics are paid. Just like video. We‚Äôll not talk about all laboratory works. And publish our solution, with " our "materials and our video recordings. Thus, we will not compete with the site themselves and not interfere with its sales of paid subscriptions to materials) </li><li>  Questions remarks and criticism appropriate?  (Of course! Always open for conversations, for this there is: Telegram: @ orion_0ri0n) </li><li>  Are there other resources with a similar theme?  (Of course!

Using the client library, it allows caching data in the RAM of many available servers (see the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memcached">wiki</a> or a little more detail on <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/42607/">habr.com</a> ). <br><br>  <i>What is the interest of this product, why is it given such attention?</i> <br>  The problem lies in the ease of use of this tool in the interests of "intruders" because the protocol used in this application is UDP.  As you remember, what is the difference between TCP vs UDP protocols ( <a href="https://otvet.mail.ru/question/24419058">let me</a> remind you who forgot for example: <a href="https://otvet.mail.ru/question/24419058">otvet.mail</a> / <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/UDP">Wiki</a> or <a href="http://pyatilistnik.org/chem-otlichaetsya-protokol-tcp-ot-udp">link</a> ).  Those.  UDP allows you to send frame data without worrying about getting it to the destination.  And most importantly, the amount of data transmitted via UDP is several times more than TCP. <br><br>  <i>But what is the attention?</i>  And the fact that when accessing this software via the network / Internet on port 11211 with the size of the incoming packet is 100 kb.  The answer can be obtained <i>1,000‚Äì50,000</i> times more.  Those.  Sent 100 kb will return 100,000 kb.  <b>Good odds?</b>  <b>Best!</b> <br><br>  <i>But what is the danger then?</i>  <i>You ask.</i>  <i>Why do you need this information?</i> <br>  And the problem is this: in local area networks and telecom operators that do not control traffic, such kind of attack as ip spoofing is possible.  substitution of outgoing ip.  It turns out that now malicious can not only be presented by anyone, but also on behalf of him will request some information. <br><br>  <i>And here it turns out that (briefly illustrated in the image):</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/7y/fw/bc/7yfwbcmodo7zzqcy7za9-ss87nw.png"><br><br><ol><li>  An attacker using ip spoofing replaces his ip.  On ip "victims". </li><li>  Makes a request to the Memcashed server.  With a modified IP address </li><li>  The server responds to the request.  But the response to the appeal already sends the "victim" </li><li>  "Victim" comes the answer 100 times the size of the request. </li></ol><br>  In consequence of the large number of such request-responses.  An attack of Dos or DDos can occur depending on the number of ‚Äúzombies‚Äù cars. <br><br>  More details can be read here: <a href="https://www.securitylab.ru/blog/company/PandaSecurityRus/343615.php">securitylab</a> , <a href="https://xakep.ru/2018/03/05/memcached-ransom-attacks/">xakep.ru</a> , <a href="https://blog.360totalsecurity.com/en/memcached-ddos-attack-exploding/">360totalsecurity</a> <br><br>  <i>Or search Google.</i> <br><br>  <b>Mitigation:</b> How to fix the Memcached server vulnerability? <br>  One of the easiest ways to prevent the abuse of Memcached servers as reflectors is a firewall blocking or restricting UDP speed on the source port 11211. Because Memcached uses INADDR_ANY and runs with UDP support by default, administrators are advised to disable UDP support if they do not use it.  An attack through Memcached cannot be easily stopped by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) if spoofing IP is allowed on the Internet. <br><br>  An example of finding a service with nmap <i>(not the most rational way)</i> <br> <code>nmap 192.168.1.1 -p 11211 -sU -sS --script memcached-info</code> <br> <br>  In this cycle of laboratory work, it will be possible to become familiar with the simple intelligence functions of the Memcashed service.  Where will the tools from the Metasploit arsenal be affected?  And standard Linux system commands.  Not that complicated and mediocre. <br><br><h3>  <b>Parsing Laboratory [Practice]</b> </h3><br><h4>  <b>[Menu]</b> </h4><br>  Each laboratory work has menu items: <br>  1. Task <br>  2.

Find the version of memcached server using nmap. <br>  2. Find the version information using netcat or telnet. <br>  3. If you need to use the nmap scripts. <br>  4. Find the number of current items on the memcached server using memcstat. <br>  5. Find the value stored in the key ‚Äúflag‚Äù from the key value of the pairs value dumped by the available metasploit module. <br>  6.

(not any virtual machines. Everything is already installed and configured for you. All lab scripts are already inside. There is nothing to download, search, invent is not necessary!) <i>As a rule (but not always) materials, scripts and databases are in the root folder, or at home.</i> <br><br>  <b>Task 1:</b> Find the version of memcached server using nmap. <br><br>  Hint already given earlier.

Since we were assured that all the scripts are already installed, we try: <br><br><pre> <code class="plaintext hljs">Nmap ‚Äìp 111211 ‚Äìscript memcached-info 182.220.144.3</code> </pre> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zu/nn/f4/zunnf4uukytirnz6d1odoxfhobe.png"><br><br>  <b>Result:</b> 2147 <br><br>  <b>Task 4:</b> Find the number of current items on the memcached server using memcstat. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cw/tf/cj/cwtfcjxjk4wmjuacun9pta7iepi.png"></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/uw/mk/vx/uwmkvxmgxzhrtzi1hib4jwa0m9a.png"></div><br><pre> <code class="plaintext hljs">memcstat ‚Äìh memcstat --servers=‚ÄùIP‚Äù</code> </pre> <br>  <b>Result:</b> curr_items: 10 <br><br>  <b>Task 5:</b> Find the value stored in the ‚Äúflag‚Äù key from the key value pairs reset by the available metasploit module <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/o0/l_/ir/o0l_irlwrlm1qboa_pfe1lvmd_o.png"><br><br><pre> <code class="plaintext hljs">use auxiliary/gather/memcached_extractor show options set rhosts 192.220.144.3 run</code> </pre> <br>  Script response: flag "VALUE flag 0 32 \ r \ n25c8dc1c75c9965dff9afd3c8ced2775 \ r \ nEND \ r \ n" <br>  <b>Result:</b> "VALUE flag 0 32 \ r \ n25c8dc1c75c9965dff9afd3c8ced2775 \ r \ nEND \ r \ n" <br>  (25c8dc1c75c9965dff9afd3c8ced2775) In principle, the same thing. <br><br>  <b>Task 6:</b> Find the name of all the keys to the memcached server using memcdump. <br><br>  <b>Hint:</b> we already know them.

We look at the screenshot with "Result 5". <br><br><h4>  Let's sum up </h4><br>  <b>1. Regarding this lab</b> <br><br>  As we have seen, there are several approaches to solving the set tasks (clearly visible on question 5, 6 and 7) and, most importantly, your time spent depends on the choice of the solution. <br><br>  Unfortunately, I did not understand the essence of task number 2.  But alas, he did not get success ( <s>Or maybe it was necessary to do everything at all so that nmap ‚Äìo ip ‚Äúaddress‚Äù or nmap ‚ÄìA ‚Äúip address‚Äù.</s> But this is another story). <br><br>  <b>2. Regarding the entire resource.</b> <br><br>  What we liked this resource: <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Spoiler header</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  1. A lot of laboratory work on various topics <br>  2. There is no need to look for various utilities for a particular attack.  (everything is already in the lab) <br>  3. There is no need to deploy virtual images / containers on your hardware.  And spend time on it.  (saves a lot of time) <br>  4. Everything works through the browser.  No need to have on hand putti and other utilities.  Everything is already there <br>  5. Free! <br>  6. Constant updates (Last update + 160 laboratory works.) <br>  7. There are answers to every lab.  Even if you are not sure about the result, you can check yourself. <br>  8. Safe!  Not punishable by law.  (If not to break it) <br>  9. There are no restrictions on the execution time and the number of attempts.  (I lie - is. But these are the details, see the minuses of the project) <br>  10. And I think the most important thing that hooked me to this project.  This is an opportunity to self-study new directions.  There are no ready-made solutions (there are tips in the lab), but only directions with the expectation of a certain result. <br>  11. It is possible to jointly pass part of the lab. <br>  12. There is a CSF. </div></div><br>  <b>What did not like:</b> <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Spoiler header</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  1. Restriction on the number of instances launches.  During the day, only 10 instances starts. <br>  2. A pair of the result does not match the answer to the site. <br>  3. There is no support for the Russian language. <br>  4. Weak iron allocated to each instance.  (after all, long processed commands) <br>  5. The console breaks the connection after a certain time.
