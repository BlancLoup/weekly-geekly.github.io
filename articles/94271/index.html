  <section class="page js-page"><h1>E-learning today or what LMS is used today? (Part 1)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <b>E-learning (short for English Electronic Learning)</b> is an e-learning system, synonymous with terms such as e-learning, distance learning, computer-assisted learning, network-based learning, virtual learning, and learning using information and electronic technologies. <br><br>  Creation of courses for distance learning systems is made in accordance with the standards of SCORM, AICC, IMS. <br><br>  <b>AICC</b> is the very first e-learning standard.  In connection with the long history, he was supported by many distance learning systems and therefore remains in demand today.  The current development of the standard takes place in the field of formalizing the interaction of learning management systems and training module creation systems, which in the future will allow the use of a significantly larger number of training courses, including those created for other standards.

      <b>Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM)</b> is a standard developed for distance learning systems.  This standard contains requirements for the organization of educational material and the entire system of distance learning.  SCORM makes it possible to ensure the compatibility of components and the possibility of their repeated use: the training material is represented by individual small blocks that can be included in different training courses and used by the distance learning system regardless of who, where and with what means were created.  SCORM is based on the XML standard. <br><br>  <b>Ims.</b>  <b>The IMS standard is</b> developed and maintained by the IMS Global Learning Consortium.  Work on its development has been going on since 1997.  Unlike other standards, it was created from the very beginning for use in higher educational institutions.  The main directions for the development of IMS specifications are metadata, content packaging, question and test compatibility, and content management. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Today there are quite a lot of LMS (Learning Management System - Learning Management System) for organizing distance learning through E-learning (BaumanTraining, WRC e-Education System, REDCLASS, Sakai, Universys WS, SATELLITE-DOTSENT, OROX, Elearning 3000, Moodle, BlackBoard, etc.) Undoubtedly the leaders are Moodle, Sakai and for American schools, you can still turn on BlackBoard, although recently there has been a growing competition between Moodle and BlackBoard. <br><br>  These systems can be divided into 3 main areas: <br>  1. Corporate distance learning (is the fastest growing); <br>  2. Distance learning in the system of higher and secondary education; <br>  3. Distance learning in state and local government. <br><br>  In the CIS, the most popular are Moodle and Sakai in a non-consecutive turn due to its free and open source. <br><br>  <b>Moodle</b> <br><br>  This LMS is written by Australian developers in php, as the database uses MySQL, it is quite easy to deploy, its undoubted advantage is the openness of source codes, which allows you to create the plug-in or system development necessary for certain tasks, although it's worth noting what to do. some time to figure out what is responsible for what and how it all works.  By the way, one of the most famous extensions for Moodle is the electronic dean's system, but more on that in the following reviews, if of course it will be interesting to users of the habr. <br><br>  As for working with Moodle, it should be noted that the interface is quite understandable and I did not notice any difficulties in mastering it, although it looks a bit miserable in terms of design.  What can we do in this LMS? <br>  And we can do this: <br>  1. Each student and teacher can edit their profile - well, that goes without saying. <br>  2. Students can track changes that occur in the studied courses, for example, the teacher has downloaded a new training manual. <br>  3. And teachers can keep track of when the student last used this system and what he did. <br>  4. It is possible to conduct online surveys of students. <br>  5. Select the type of displaying the structure of courses: calendar, forum, thematic <br>  6. Collect all the information on grades on the same page. <br>  7. Notify students by email about important events (for example, postponing the exam date) <br>  8. There is an open API for writing plugins. <br><br>  For now.  I ask you not to judge strictly so this is my first post on Habr√©, if I'm interested in doing the most complete review, like Moodle itself, as well as the other LMS mentioned above. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/94271/">https://habr.com/ru/post/94271/</a></p>
