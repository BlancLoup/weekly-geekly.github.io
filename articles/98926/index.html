And it is only now after reading the title that it seems that everything is obvious ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In fact, everything turned out to be much simpler - when I visited <b><a href="http://dedal.habrahabr.ru/">DeDaL</a></b> for quite a while, who now works at Thermaltake, he saw funny unusual things that he asked for for a while.  For the most part for the sake of interest, because I have never come across anything like this before.  Moreover, since no one knows about this product.

      But it is quite unusual.  So, the company <b><a href="http://luxa2.com/">Luxa2</a></b> (read in English lu-sa-tu) was founded in 2009 and is a subsidiary of <b>Thermaltake</b> .  The main vector of development is the creation of premium accessories for Apple products, as well as the production of completely independent devices such as media centers.  I myself don‚Äôt really like the word ‚Äúpremium‚Äù - those who really don‚Äôt do anything premium have vulgarized it.  However, looking at the products, it is difficult to find a more suitable word.  The motto is good - ‚ÄúUniquely You‚Äù. <br><br>  Today I‚Äôll talk about three devices that make up the almost complete lineup of the ‚ÄúLaptop Cooler‚Äù section on the company's website, with the exception of one of the largest models (then I wouldn‚Äôt just drop it).  In descending order - Luxa2 M2, M3-Air and M4. <br><br>  I‚Äôll say right away that during the test I didn‚Äôt have a macbook - everyone clamped) Therefore, nothing was left but to test for what it is.  And as a test copy, I took the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/96276/">Nokia netbook</a> - in addition to the external similarity, the netbook has exactly the same flat bottom as the notebooks from Apple.  The location of the processor is probably different, but the device is notably cooled only passively from the Nokia device, so for tests this is the most (cooling the device without error for total noise). <br><br><h2>  Luxa2 M2 </h2><br><br>  All devices of the company are delivered in stylish covers made of genuine leather - the color of ivory (basic) is very nicely in harmony with the brown inserts.  Magnetic fasteners and a carbine for carrying - everything is there. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f98/bd1/f96/f98bd1f96a874b6735aaa23cff2fb146.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The device itself is silver - completely aluminum, frosted and rough.  On the case there is a pair of strazikov - well, don `t know ...) But the build quality is an exceptional five with a plus, you just don‚Äôt have to complain.  A massive piece of aluminum (430g with dimensions 86x34x162mm assembled), consisting of two parts connected by a hinge mechanism - the hand rejoices. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e0a/811/081/e0a811081d7ab37d65685c2e9a39c577.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And then everything is simple - at times when the laptop is very hot, unroll the piece of iron and place it under the laptop.  On the inside of the stand, on one side there is a 50mm cooler (behind the net; 3000rpm, 7.1 CFM airflow) with a retractable USB lanyard (15cm), and on the other a special thermal interface, somewhat resembling thermal paste. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3ae/241/df0/3ae241df0d58684f7dd1d4acabdaefd6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/36b/204/f4f/36b204f4fd9f71fbf2636f4feffe09df.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/be6/710/f9a/be6710f9a0227d2deb20a0f7bd127348.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The difference is that it remains on the device all the time and leaves no traces - it is needed only for more efficient heat transfer from the laptop case to the heat sink.  The USB lanyard is interesting - it takes up one port, but it ‚Äúfrees up‚Äù it - you can plug in another device right through the wire from the stand. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/159/8df/7aa/1598df7aafa9bbecf1080f49f1eb263b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/82c/db2/a3b/82cdb2a3bf220df70bc0778e6e74e2e1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The result of the work can be considered a decrease in the processor temperature (!) By 5 degrees - this is how much the most distant heat source cools.  Accordingly, the case is also cooled, but I have never met the temperature sensors of the case (except as a thermometer).  It is a good result and maybe it will be even better on MacBooks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/af2/94a/228/af294a2281f2c106ec7aac2f877a8602.png" alt="image">  <b>Advantages and disadvantages</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/881/117/ccb/881117ccbc836c685868fb19a2bf46c1.png" alt="+">  Stylish case <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/881/117/ccb/881117ccbc836c685868fb19a2bf46c1.png" alt="+">  Nice design, beautiful build <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/881/117/ccb/881117ccbc836c685868fb19a2bf46c1.png" alt="+">  Highly efficient cooling device <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/881/117/ccb/881117ccbc836c685868fb19a2bf46c1.png" alt="+">  The thought-over design, "functional" USB wire <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/24f/0ae/920/24f0ae920b085ead2e6d649649177122.png" alt="-">  Insignificant noise during operation (according to specs - 17.5 dB-A) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/24f/0ae/920/24f0ae920b085ead2e6d649649177122.png" alt="-">  Not suitable for all laptops <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/24f/0ae/920/24f0ae920b085ead2e6d649649177122.png" alt="-">  You will have to move the laptop synchronously with the stand <br><br>  Actually, all three minuses are quite logical and not essential - I wrote them only for completeness - they will be valid for the other two devices in this article.  By the way, this stand is designed only for the MacBook 13 ", MacBook Air 13", MacBook Pro 13 "and 15", but as you can see, nothing prevented me from using it on the Nokia netbook :) <br><br><h2>  Luxa2 M3-Air </h2><br>  Practically everything is the same as in the case of the M2, only in a more compact package (weight 240g at 33x162x44mm assembled) - the manufacturer calls it ‚Äúhalf the size of M2‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/eca/090/958/eca0909586911fd5cbd9d5d3324d1036.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/01c/228/f98/01c228f9853abb25df02cadee3886835.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The same label, the same rhinestones, about the same case - everything is the same, just just smaller.  The cooler also skukozhilsya - now it's 30mm carlsonchik able to drive per minute up to 2.6 cubic feet (CFM) of air.  But the noise increased - 19dB-A at 5600 (!) Rpm. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/281/13e/d35/28113ed35496352a45f7ad2f9da4991c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/285/d72/518/285d7251827f186d95c97c1c92921c24.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  To check the performance, I had to carefully load the netbook from the outlet, which took a decent amount of time.  But the result was almost the same, 4-5 degrees.  Compatibility is the same - MacBook 13 ", MacBook Air 13", MacBook Pro 13 "and 15", the pros and cons are absolutely identical to the M2 model. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/925/f8c/e9a/925f8ce9ad3c01eab9fecceab1ea72b5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The waffle-iron has almost no resemblance - maximum knife sharpener :) <br><br><h2>  Luxa2 M4 </h2><br>  It would be completely ridiculous if the model of the M4 cooler, by analogy, was a sort of wand, ‚Äúhalf the size of M3‚Äù.  Complete surprise - inside a leather case in the shape of a cube (and they write, ‚Äúsize of a Rubiks cube‚Äù) ... there was an unknown ... well, you get the idea) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5b9/485/f92/5b9485f922669bdb321d2b8d239f6e49.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  A small metal case in the form of a cylinder - recognizable grungy aluminum, rhinestones ... but this time with a white decorative mesh and rubber feet.  I am almost sure that in the case of a repeated question on Twitter, 19 out of 20 people would say that this is a ‚Äúyo-yo‚Äù or ‚Äúportable speaker‚Äù, but not a portable stand-cooler. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d2c/29b/33e/d2c29b33eee2858781bb532efa19ceee.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I myself didn‚Äôt immediately understand how and where ... well, the complete break of the pattern) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8e8/b27/a0f/8e8b27a0f688d9c964fbe59e873812ff.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Actually, everything is simple again - we divide the case into two parts - the usual USB-wire is in one, which means the cooler.  The second part of the body serves only as a stand for balance. <br>  Accordingly, the result will definitely not be the same as in the case of M2 and M3 - there is no thermal interface and a massive heat sink.  Accordingly, those assumptions that the processor in MacBooks is in the right or left corner of the device became more persistent.  I don‚Äôt know for sure where the processor is in Nokia‚Äôs netbook - for the most part only the battery was heated ... but for balance and ease of use I had to put pancakes at the corners. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c60/f40/c30/c60f40c3058c7c8f164249c385e16697.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The cooler is exactly the same as in the M3 - 30x30mm (5600rpm, 2.6CFM, 19dB-A), and the dimensions of the assembly as a whole are 62x62x39mm (with a weight of 165g).  The result is more modest - the CPU temperature has dropped by only 1-2 degrees, but then again, perhaps with a MacBook, the situation is more significant.  The supported lineup is as follows - MacBook 13 ", MacBook Air 13", MacBook Pro 13 ", 15" and 17 ". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ec4/78d/203/ec478d203a04e1ea5b86ba6213b5ae2b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The disadvantages include lower efficiency and greater discomfort when transporting a working laptop. <br><br><h2>  Luxa2 M1 </h2><br>  To complete the picture, I decided to write a few words about this ‚ÄúLyuska‚Äù - I saw it live, but did not take the test.  And, it seems, in vain - this stand has almost nothing to do with all other models.  By the way, here it is in the literal sense a stand - almost a two-kilogram (1800g) thick aluminum sheet (50x386x303mm) has 4 movable legs - for some reason, associations with some scorpions, headcrabs and other fauna are immediately born.  But it looks great - a rare stand with a similar price tag can match the quality of performance and, perhaps, design. <br>  This time it is absolutely silent stand (exclusively on passive cooling) - instead of coolers on the case there are two already familiar oblong areas of ‚Äúthermal paste‚Äù, under which there are heat pipes.  I can not judge the effectiveness, but definitely definitely - it will be very convenient to carry a laptop on such a stand, and in addition to cooling, it allows you to adjust the angle of the laptop.  I repeat - it looks exceptionally cool. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d27/15b/212/d2715b212eb5db29b65da2800a0c00d9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Well, perhaps that's all.  I have not seen such coolers on the store shelves, but they are on the Internet.  The biggest Lyuska (M1) costs 3,000 rubles, the M2 - 2000, the ‚Äúgolden mean‚Äù of the M3-Air will cost 1,700 and the ‚Äúyo-yo‚Äù M4 costs 1,400 rubles.  On the one hand - quite a lot, on the other hand, I remember two of my Chinese coasters - they cost the same (even more expensive), but they are not that awesome.  As well as a stylish case for them either. <br>  Whether to advise these devices to purchase?  I can, because the devices are really good in every sense of the word.  Another question - do you need it?  Probably, it lives well without coolers, then it will be a waste of money.  But if the laptop is often under load and decently heated, while most of the time is on the table - these accessories are very suitable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c29/f36/d20/c29f36d208a898b09c3a3f3ffc8c4eb5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I advise you to get acquainted with the range of devices that the manufacturer <a href="http://www.luxa2.com/">offers</a> .  And if I don‚Äôt yet have iPhones, iPods, iPads, the company's media centers have aroused great interest.  I saw one ... I really wanted to. Therefore, maybe someday I will write something else if DeDaL does not do this. <br><br>  <b>Successes!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/98926/">https://habr.com/ru/post/98926/</a></p>
