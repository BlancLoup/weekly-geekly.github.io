  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Detector of authenticity of excise stamps and securities</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  There was a case with me, about 8 years ago.  I paid the customer for the order and gave me the money right in the store from the cash register.  The notes were large and looked absolutely no different from others, but when I tried to pay them for a loan at a bank, a problem arose.  One of the bills was fake.  In general, this procedure is unpleasant. <br><br>  They called the investigators, who asked questions for a long time and psychologically probed if I was not specifically trying to sell these bills.  It all ended relatively well, but I was left without money.  Here the victim is not insured at all, moreover, the law clearly interprets such moments - since you have fake money, you are automatically guilty.  And then how it will turn out either you will get off with just a conversation, or you will be detained in the flesh until the search of the apartment, there is not enough pleasant.  Well, who got burned with milk, blowing even water.  At that time I purchased an ultraviolet flashlight and more carefully check all the notes that fall into my hands.  But almost a decade has passed, the technologies did not stand still, and a compact detector of excise stamps and banknotes is replacing UV flashlights and bulky professional detectors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/229/fdb/15a/229fdb15aaca49b38191423bfc186499.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <b>Packaging and what's inside?</b> </h2><br>  Let's take a look inside the box.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1ee/73a/8cd/1ee73a8cdae04fcb9b6f2d6068183f53.jpg"><br><br>  By itself, the box is already small, no more than 7-8cm in height and width. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b85/e82/759/b85e82759b1a43b3ac11314f4a6555de.jpg"><br><br>  Inside is a small instruction, warranty card ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/61f/cb8/ff3/61fcb8ff35354c63848923e3e50343a8.jpg"><br><br>  A ring with a mini-carabiner on a chain, a pair of batteries and the device itself. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/72f/096/66d/72f09666dbf1458aa1785705c3d43e6a.jpg"><br><br>  The detector uses a single battery size 23AE, the same is often used in key chains from car alarms.  One battery at 12 volts. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5d3/b48/cd7/5d3b48cd7a4540df891721e9a4521bc4.jpg"><br><br>  The device is quite compact, here it is next to a regular cigarette lighter. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/24a/d11/761/24ad11761b044f5fa6155631091df0c8.jpg"><br><br>  From the front end, the device has a window through which the detection of the labels ‚ÄúAnti-Stokes‚Äù or ‚ÄúSpecial Elements I‚Äù occurs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/973/201/e71/973201e71d5f4520b85021f9edfec697.jpg"><br><br>  The main control element of the detector is a button.  She is the only one here. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7f2/a5e/26d/7f2a5e26d1a146e6a806bc9c4e56da60.jpg"><br><br>  On the reverse side there is a battery cover.  Behind the mini-eyebolt in order to hook the detector to the keys on the ring. <br><br>  It's very simple, I think even the instruction is not needed to figure out how it works.  And it works confidently and without failures. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/38a/1a7/d3e/38a1a7d3e3e94a869acc7ee670dbd7c7.jpg"><br><br>  We bring the detector to the excise stamp and press the button.  If the green LED lights up and a signal is heard, then everything is ok.  If the detector is silent and flashes red when the button is pressed and released, then the ‚ÄúAnti-Stokes‚Äù tags are not detected. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4bc/2ba/a26/4bc2baa268c04342a50e7af609853868.jpg"><br><br>  Now it is a little more detailed about the technology of ‚ÄúSpecial element I‚Äù or ‚ÄúAnti-Lockbox‚Äù. <br><br><h2>  <b>How it works?</b> </h2><br>  Specially designed paint with anti-Stokes phosphors, which under the influence of focused laser radiation with a wavelength of 940-960 nm causes a fluorescent glow, called the effect of "Antistoks". <br>  Since the effect of the glow of paint under the influence of radiation has a wavelength visible to the human eye, this type of detection is used in viewing detectors to check banknotes and securities.  The check for this attribute is called the detection of the special element ‚ÄúAND‚Äù. <br><br>  The security feature "Antistoks" is the only official machine-readable security feature that counterfeiters haven‚Äôt been able to simulate.  Thus, the use of this mode is 100% guaranteed to detect counterfeit banknotes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/097/52d/089/09752d0893664661b68ccd908d5f24a0.jpg"><br><br>  As a matter of fact, my UV flashlight doesn‚Äôt highlight these marks, which is understandable.  Special coherent radiation is needed.  The only way to determine authenticity with UV is luminous fibers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fad/6c9/906/fad6c99063d9453c844f47e0fce88812.jpg"><br><br>  Here, for example, the excise stamp on a bottle of wine: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2fa/0ea/9e2/2fa0ea9e2c8342429be950e1d89c2f94.jpg"><br><br>  Check passed. <br><br>  On the excise stamp, anti-Stokes are scattered somehow in interesting places from a certain distance, the entire excise stamp is detected in green.  Maybe this is a mistake?  Check on a simple label. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/849/442/87c/84944287c4004752b5187f67ad7af80b.jpg"><br><br>  No, it is stably red here.  As I did not complain and did not attach, there were no failures. <br><br>  Go to the bills. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/976/d3d/375/976d3d375cd34eca97edf6b806f550d5.jpg"><br><br>  In the ultraviolet fiber glow.  But the label "Antistoks" anymore. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3ea/b6e/a0e/3eab6ea0e7aa4c3686568eaadff3d36d.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3e2/5fe/57e/3e25fe57e268455ea635a0004fbf33e1.jpg"><br><br>  We check them with a detector. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3db/a56/5e9/3dba565e9e2c4ac1b14bc9da0533fa30.jpg"><br><br>  All perfectly. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/38f/978/872/38f978872b2e41a29283ad0bb3f23a34.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/23a/f35/663/23af35663ce74639af27182579bcc981.jpg"><br><br>  Both small bills and large ones are also tested. <br><br>  The detector perfectly checks all securities for the presence of ‚ÄúSpecial Element I‚Äù, and thanks to its compact dimensions it easily fits in your pocket or even on keys.  The only moment that confuses me here is the well-known Soft-touch coverage, I will explain why.  Over time, it is erased.  Especially on the protruding parts, as a result, rather quickly, any gadget covered with this miracle coating begins to look worse than it would have been made of simple plastic.  In this case, the detector has angular shapes and at the corners the coating will be erased fairly quickly.  Of course, this does not affect the functionality in any way, but aesthetically it will not look so good.  Let's see how long it will last. <br><br>  I completely forgot to look inside.  Let's disassemble this black box, the more there is not a single screw, all snap. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a70/75e/696/a7075e69690749d582e0849b3304a21d.jpg"><br><br>  We hook on the edge of the plastic and divide the body into two halves. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aab/21d/637/aab21d63799d40d39e595979729abd69.jpg"><br><br>  All the interesting electronics is hidden in a plastic casing and filled with a hard compound, which is so easy to find out for ICs, which is a pity. <br><br>  Well, by tradition, I remind you that you can purchase an authenticity detector within 14 days with a 10% discount on the promotional code: GEEKT-DPD.
