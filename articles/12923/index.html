  <section class="page js-page"><h1>We are ours, we will build a new world! About the Commonwealth of Professionals ‚ÄúFor the New Social Web‚Äù</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <em>Everyone who hears the phrase in the heading of this note immediately recalls the following sentence of the proletarian hymn: "Whoever was nothing, that will be everything."</em>  <em>I beg you, do not remember.</em>  <em>After all, history knows another example, when more than two hundred years ago, a very small group of so-called founding fathers of the United States wrote out on paper the basic rules of life by which this country now lives.</em>  <em>America, of course, can be treated differently.</em>  <em>However, I think that there are few willing to argue with the statement that Americans live is not bad at all.</em>  <em>That's what it means to not put slogans at the forefront: ‚ÄúDestroy to the ground‚Äù and ‚ÄúWho was nothing, that will be everything‚Äù :)</em> <br><br>  But this, as you already understood, in this short note will not be about America.  With this note, I temporarily interrupt the series that I started, ‚Äú <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D28920">How do we build a social web?</a>  ‚ÄúAlthough, in general, the note is devoted to the same topic.  And I have to stop for a very simple reason, which I have already mentioned in the <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D29684">last published article on this</a> series.  Well, the discussion did not go, although the comments in <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/blog/pure_content">habrhabr</a> , where abbreviated versions of relevant notes were posted, were not a few.  What conclusions do I draw from this?  There are several: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  1. Positions on the conceptual question of whether everything is fine in the social web has already been determined.  Everyone who read my notes like " <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D16344">My Space, which ...</a> " preceding this series, took its place in this or that camp <br>  2. To discuss specific issues under the conditions of ‚Äúwhite noise‚Äù, and even ‚Äúblack noise‚Äù sometimes, there are almost no new comments, often far beyond the limits of the problem posed.  Moreover, in such a specific discussion, as I understand it, one or two dozen experts are interested today. <br>  3. For the rest, such a discussion seems impractical until they see the functional stuffing of the proposed <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D28920">‚Äúdevice‚Äù</a> (resource).  After all, "elements of intelligence" is, although important, but only part of the "corps" and the contents of a wide variety of "devices" that could be classified as intelligent social resources (SRI). <br>  4. To me, I hope, for obvious reasons for all, I don‚Äôt really want to put on display a detailed ‚Äúdevice circuit‚Äù developed by me - a resource whose intelligence could well be considered as typical.  In any case, if we expose our know-how, then at least in exchange for full feedback on the substance of the issue. <br><br>  So it turns out almost a vicious circle.  Based on this, together with <a href="http://mastak.habrahabr.ru/">mastak</a> , <a href="http://abbasov.habrahabr.ru/">abbasov</a> and <a href="http://fibre.habrahabr.ru/">Fiber, we</a> propose a different strategy for further work, namely:

      1. A Commonwealth of Professionals ‚ÄúFor the New Social Web‚Äù (SNSV) is being created, to which experts are connected, and above all from members of the collective blog ‚Äú <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/blog/pure_content">Intelligent Social Web</a> ‚Äù, interested in substantive discussion of specific issues of building and using this type of resources. <br>  2. All such discussions are made at one of the iTech Bridge forums, specially created for the Commonwealth. <br>  3. The Commonwealth regards itself as a branch of the above collective blog habrahabr, where it places for wide discussion all the issues that claim to be such a discussion.  From the collective blog, the main personnel ‚Äúfeed‚Äù of the Commonwealth is carried out. <br>  4. At a certain stage in the work of the Commonwealth (the sooner the better), a group of developers of a certain real SRI is formed from among its participants, into which the basic ‚Äúelements of intelligence‚Äù developed by the Commonwealth are laid. <br>  5. Before this, but already within the Development Group, the technical parameters of both these elements and the designed SRI are being clarified. <br><br>  I invite all interested specialists to join our Commonwealth, after having familiarized themselves with the draft Regulation on its activities.  This project is posted on a special iTech Bridge - the forum ‚Äú <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowforum%3D822">For the New Social Web</a> ‚Äù and is available only to users registered with iTech Bridge and received the status of ‚Äútemporary participant in the NSHE‚Äù.  On the conditions for the transition to the status of ‚Äúpermanent participant of the SNSV‚Äù read in the <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D30811">draft Regulation</a> . <br><br>  <em><strong>How to obtain the status of a ‚Äútemporary participant in the SNSV‚Äù in order to have access to the Commonwealth Regulations, read <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D30810">here</a> .</strong></em> <em><strong><br></strong></em> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/12923/">https://habr.com/ru/post/12923/</a></p>
