      The name of this country is Northern Cyprus, and officially the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC). <br><br> <a href="http://dimlazarev.ru/cyprus/foto/pano_1/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c46/9b9/eca/c469b9eca928844dc8af905f9f7fb1c2.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br>  <b>(some photos are clickable)</b> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><blockquote>  <b>Explanation:</b> <br><br>  There is "Cyprus" (also known as "Southern Cyprus", is friends with Greece), on the other, slightly less than half of the island, is located "Northern Cyprus", which is friends with Turkey.  They are connected by one name and a common story.  In the distant 74 year there was an armed conflict, the echoes of which wander through the Internet, creating many myths, often unfounded.  Southern Cyprus is a recognized state and enters the EU, which means that to enter there to live and work is a long and tedious process that has been described in other <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/migration/">‚ÄúIT expatriates‚Äù</a> .  Northern Cyprus is a state officially recognized by Turkey and not quite officially by Great Britain.  At the same time medveput (or rather Putin seems to be - I confuse them all the time), as I said on TV that it‚Äôs time to treat North Cyprus as an equal member of the world community.  The TRNC is funded on a large scale by Turkey and constantly receives fabulous tranches for the support and development of the economy.  And wealthy citizens of Turkey with great pleasure build five-star hotels and casinos on the coast, which actively accept tourists from different countries.  Basically, the British are going, who bought 80% of real estate and after the launch of direct flights, the Italians and Germans often took part, not to mention Russians.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Dc8iVXl5Mavw">Essay on REN-TV about non-recognition and conflict</a> .  <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9_%25D0%259A%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580">Wikipedia</a> . </blockquote><br><br>  The country has opened to the world quite recently and this is reflected in the value of real estate: real estate prices are affordable for almost everyone, comparable to the cost in any average region of Russia and of course lower than in any European country, including southern Cyprus.  If you have a commercial vein, then you easily implement it here.  Millions will not earn, but you can raise 10-15 thousand dollars a month.  The state is actively attracting investment in the economy, tourists and property buyers. <br><br>  Someone calls Northern Cyprus ‚Äúhidden paradise‚Äù (hidden paradise), Habr can call it all a freebie.  By the way, in Turkish it sounds like ‚Äúavant‚Äù probably will come in handy in the future;) <br><br>  Below is a multi-letter book - do not be alarmed, but about everything.  After reading, you can safely pack your bags and move :) <br><br>  <b>Bright future</b> <br><br>  Imagine such a picture. <br>  Sunday, you flatten yourself on one of the sandy beaches of the Mediterranean coast in an embrace with your <s>wife, Komsomol, athlete,</s> beauty, you are refreshed by a light sea breeze, and in your other hand a bottle of sweaty Ephesus.  What more to desire from life?  Is that where to go in the evening?  The mass of options ... <br><br>  You can go in the evening to Liman (the tourist center of Girne) and sitting under the starry southern sky (yes! Here you can see the stars at night) slowly absorb local delicacies (average bill per person is 600 rubles with alcohol) and stare at yachts and impressively strolling tourists. <br><br>  You can go and try your luck at the local casinos attracting with your lights and an eternal holiday.  Every self-respecting casino has a buffet and alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages.  Spending for example 20 lire on slot machines (about 400 rubles) you can eat and drink the whole evening at the expense of the institution and spend your time recklessly :) Trifle, but nice! <br><br>  Well, or go bowling with friends.  It opened the magnificent family entertainment center of the type "StarGlax."  On the ground floor there is a bowling alley and a bar-cafe, and on the lower floor there are children's entertainment, from young to old.  There you can have fun in air hockey, billiards, watch 4D movies, play in super modern slot machines.  If you have small, then you can melt it there, and in the meantime, suck whiskey and cola on the playing track. <br><br>  <b>House</b> <br><br>  And here I live in such a complex (3 ‚Äúapartment‚Äù houses + a common pool): <br><br> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dimlazarev/sets/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/992/d36/7a6/992d367a67b3452a07e160ef08d91883.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  This area is called Lapta and is about 10 km from the center of Girne.  In general, Girne stretches along the coast and smoothly passes into areas on the right and left sides. <br><br>  The apartment itself: 3 bedrooms, lounge, 2 bathrooms, barbecue area. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cdb/ed6/063/cdbed606389ba96ae4c3bdc09d91d2ac.jpg" alt="image"><br><br> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dimlazarev/4028208825/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/26b/383/0d7/26b3830d709d7f968ab085ac8199cb98.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dimlazarev/4028963988/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f44/f24/f6f/f44f24f6f7db5f07a44925927fdbab27.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  If you take it off then pay 250 pounds (multiply by 48 rubles = 12000r). <br>  If you buy it - 60,000 pounds (2,880 000r). <br>  Additional expenses: utility payments to the uncle who looks after the cleanliness of the pool and the complex as a whole - an average of 15 pounds a month from an apartment;  electricity and water - an average of $ 60 (* 29 rubles) per person.  In winter, you need to add heating to the waste. <br>  Average prices for rental housing here: 350-400 pounds (* 48r) for 3 bedrooms + lounge;  from 250 pounds for 1 bedroom + lounge, all in the center of Girne. <br><br>  Average purchase prices in the world: <br>  Take a spherical three-room apartment in a vacuum.  2 bedrooms and a lounge. <br>  Price in Spain (Mediterranean): 9 million rubles.  (70-80 m2) <br>  Price in Montenegro, Bulgaria (Mediterranean): 3.5 million rubles.  (70-80 m2) <br>  Price in southern Cyprus: 6.5 million rubles.  (100-120 m2) <br>  Price in Moscow: 8 million rubles.  (65-80 m2) <br>  Price in Chelyabinsk (Urals): 2-3 million rubles.  (65-80 m2) <br>  Price in the third largest city in the Chelyabinsk region of Miass (on the shore of <a href="http://www.turgoyak.com/">Lake Turgoyak</a> ): 1.5-2 million rubles.  (65-80 m2) Hi, Miass!  :) <br>  The price in Northern Cyprus (again our beloved Mediterranean): 1.5-2 million rubles.  (70-80 m2) Taram!  Moreover, loans are available to foreigners (more on this below). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fb2/a96/afb/fb2a96afb5e12de60d112e1ebf836200.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Work and migration legislation</b> <br><br>  Buying a house here you can get a residence permit (permit) within 21 days from the date of application, which allows you to stay in the country for as long as you like.  However, when submitting documents, you need to attach an extract from the bank that you have from 8-10 thousand dollars in your account and a certificate from the Ministry of Internal Affairs that there is no crime for your person.  But here there are options.  When buying a property, you can transfer money to your account and take an extract, and then withdraw it, but the statement will already be attached to your documents.  You can become a citizen after 5 years of permanent residence here. <br><br>  Residence permit does not give the right to work.  If you buy a home, you can work either legally or remotely.  For legal work for a local employer, there is a work visa - it‚Äôs not quite easy to get an employer, but if it is, then it is not difficult to extend it for one year.  Conditions of the visa: 1000 euros (* 43 rubles) should be put on deposit, they will be returned to the employer after your dismissal and 333 (* 20 rubles) lira of monthly contributions to the state (such a ‚Äúcomprehensive‚Äù tax).  Who is paying it?  How to agree :) De jure the employer pays.  The average salary is 1,200 lire (24,000 rubles).  For work you need 2 languages ‚Äã‚Äã- Turkish and English. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5a3/be6/d88/5a3be6d88587c50a11769051c1de100f.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  <b>Your freelance</b> <br><br>  If you have already deleted, you earn more than the average and the minimum local salary (24000r), then you can say life is good :) Banks here are blooming and smell and do not ask where you got something from the account.  You can be paid directly by international bank transfers, or you can make an intermediary yourself in the form of a Russian bank (or your country) with online banking: <br>  money from the customer -&gt; Russian account -&gt; Cyprus account -&gt; cash or card <br>  or money from the customer -&gt; Russian account -&gt; card. <br>  Cards here are accepted almost everywhere. <br><br>  <b>Taxes</b> <br><br>  The above describes all the fees that you owe to the state.  It is also a tax haven. <br><br> <a href="http://maps.google.ru/%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ll%3D35.282306,33.375864%26spn%3D0.008513,0.01929%26t%3Dh%26z%3D16"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/038/92e/4d9/03892e4d99ef94303e5584c60eee974e.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  <b>Security</b> <br><br>  They do not steal here at all, you can leave the car quietly open, and for the sake of interest, place your beech * gee *.  Come in an hour and be pleasantly surprised ... taram!  - everything is in place.  Doors in the house, too, can not close, and you can close ... without a difference. <br><br>  Medicine, on average, is equivalent to the cost in Moscow, it may be a little cheaper, but believe me, it is still possible to get sick in the fresh air, and under such conditions of life. <br><br>  The military here is respected, but not afraid.  They can only be met within the army, in the extreme case, with a glance passing by the UAZ.  This is one of the myths of the Internet.  In general, they are missing ... these are Greek insinuations.  Write in a personal, discuss, porzhom. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e0e/ef2/8e2/e0eef28e23c5f0a6e10334c73c47319f.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  <b>Children</b> <br><br>  My Russian acquaintance has three girls, from 1.5 to 7 years old, studying at Sunny Laine School.  Everyone is happy and parents and children.  They already speak 3 languages ‚Äã‚Äã(learning in English and Turkish), adapted quickly.  It costs only 300 pounds per month.  But this is a pretentious school, where children spend a full day, with meals and transfer.  There are public free schools where education is no worse.  In general, in Northern Cyprus, 6 powerful universities.  The most advanced of them is GAU ( <a href="http://www.gau.edu.tr/Eng/">Girne American University</a> ) where a diploma of international standard is issued, and students from different countries, including those from the former CIS, are very welcome (on vKontakte, you can <a href="http://vkontakte.ru/gsearch.php%3Ffrom%3Dpeople%26c%5Buni_country%5D%3D1%26c%5Buni_city%5D%3D3249%26c%5Buniversity%5D%3D492270">search for</a> ‚ÄúGAU‚Äù <a href="http://vkontakte.ru/gsearch.php%3Ffrom%3Dpeople%26c%5Buni_country%5D%3D1%26c%5Buni_city%5D%3D3249%26c%5Buniversity%5D%3D492270">in general</a> ).  By the way, education is another way to get here. <br><br>  Neither adults nor children pontiyutsya.  The cult of clothes is not here.  Nobody cares what you are wearing, a normal European approach.  Relationship, friendship and other human values ‚Äã‚Äãare appreciated.  And this is not the last reason that often Muscovite parents, who already have hair on end, what to wear and what to bring their child to school or institute, send their children here. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5fa/5f2/37e/5fa5f237e7cdcd7d9435d81ca6157040.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Other</b> <br><br>  Languages: Turkish, English.  Unfortunately, the municipal courses as in the south are not heard here, but the Turkish government made such an open language course and posted it <a href="http://www.de-fa.ru/dersonline.htm">here</a> .  Although for the life of knowledge of 100 English words is enough. <br><br>  Currency: in stores, good restaurants and gas stations, they take on an American dollar, English pound, Turkish lira - it is the main currency.  1 lira (TL) = 19-21r, which would be easier to assume, let it be 20 rubles. <br><br>  Transport: bus passes around the city (the longest route is 3 lira (60r), I travel from my area to the office for 2.5 lira).  If you plan to live here, then you need a means of transportation.  The car is the most popular, then they drive here on ‚Äústools‚Äù, then on normal motorcycles and even on quad bikes - ranked by popularity / visibility :) They drive everything neatly.  Gasoline 95y worth 1.85 lira.  The distances here are small.  If you do not have rights yet - get them in Russia (there is a moment of cheating here, if interested, ask).  Training in Turkish. <br><br>  Food prices: I generally said about prices - they are equal to ours.  But there are bonuses: everything is fresh, in the season of any fruit its prices tend to zero. <br><br>  Local population: Turkish Cypriots, Turks, elderly Englishmen, tourists, Russians are there, but few and contingent is different from southern Cyprus.  Local friendly and responsive, slow and capricious.  Everyone around is smoking: (Moslems are not pronounced, Europeanized. In the evenings, you can hear the name of the imams for prayer. <br><br>  Internet: 3G (like Yota for speed) limit - 10 gigs per month for 90 lira + 20 lira for a sim card and the connection is mega unstable.  The home provider will take 70 lire for megabit unlimited. <br><br>  Climate: well, he has paradise and paradise in Africa :) All year round 30 degrees except for 3 very hot months - July, August, September and "winter" when it rains lightly and the temperature drops to terrible plus 15 :)) Autumn, winter and spring from November to March. <br><br>  Departure to other countries: via Turkey with a Russian passport (or your country). <br><br>  Entry: for a Russian citizen visa-free message (in my opinion, they generally let everyone in yet).  You can stay in the country up to 30 days (the visa is placed at the airport upon arrival).  The ticket costs (there and back) 16-20000r.  Flights from Moscow, St. Petersburg, Yekaterinburg, Kazan, Rostov, Almaty, Astana, Ashgabat, Baku, Bishkek, Dnepropetrovsk, Donetsk, Dushanbe, Kiev, Minsk, Odessa, Simferopol, Tashkent. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/120/5ae/efc/1205aeefc32b1934de8a2092192a894f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>A crisis</b> <br><br>  You% average username% this does not apply. <br>  The country lives in tourism and real estate sales.  Tourists go.  But the real estate boom was in 2004 thanks to retirees from England.  There is now a crisis and retirees are in no hurry to sell their belongings for cheap. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7fc/6ff/852/7fc6ff852b1f7a5f1cdbf5b2bbc83bcf.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Who wrote it all</b> <br><br>  Hi habr :) This is <s>my</s> first post. <br>  I am 24 years old and I got a job at a Russian real estate developer company recently.  I am on the island for almost 3 weeks and plan to stay for a long time.  My previous migration was from the Chelyabinsk region to Moscow.  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dimlazarev/sets/">My photos</a> (just the corrected colors in the lightroom), but three weeks was not enough to write the whole text alone and the forums and our office helped me. <br><br>  We are in the city of Girne (Kyrenia).
