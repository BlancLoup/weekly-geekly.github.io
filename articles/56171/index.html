And I thought not about how bad it is to deceive my employer, and not about what a vulgar and rotten way to ‚Äúearn‚Äù my bread with margarine.  The idea somehow closely connected with freelancing, where it is much easier to lay a ‚Äúkickback‚Äù in value than, for example, when a client works with an advertising agency. <br><br>  The size of the rollback from the freelancer, of course, is less than from the RA, but the recipient in the first case is just a manager of average success.  In the case of RA, the rollback is much greater, and the recipient is at least the project manager on the client side.  I‚Äôll not consider the chain of the RA manager-client, but I‚Äôll tell you with pleasure how the ‚Äúrollback‚Äù to the manager from a freelancer can influence the course of the project.

      I think everyone understands the mechanism of rollback.  They bring you a project for a miscalculation, you send the cost of work to the manager (for example, 100 rubles), and he asks you to make a cost of, say, 130 rubles (modestly, add 30%).  After paying for the project, the company will return this surcharge to the manager in cash for a glass of tea, noting the successful completion of the project.  Its benefit is clear - to fuck the agency for 30 rubles, yours too - you are guaranteed not only to receive an order, but also ‚Äúyour‚Äù person on the client‚Äôs side.  It would seem that everything is chocolate.  But how can this not affect the course of the project itself and your reputation?  Omit the moral side, we felt it in childhood: to deceive n-h-o-r-o-w-oh, all the secret becomes clear ... Let's, as adults, try to expand the rolling side of the issue into pragmatic and hard-core pros and cons . <br><br>  <b>Pros:</b> <br>  + Your project.  Cheers, comrades! <br>  + Questions about the project will be resolved with lightning speed.  Still would!  You have bought a customer representative for 30 silversmiths. <br>  + The next order is also yours.  It‚Äôs like a drug addiction: having received a dose of light money once, you always want another time. <br>  + You have dirt on a person.  He is all in your power (here we wipe drool from such omnipotence). <br><br>  Here, it seems, and all the advantages of a rollback.  Go further ... <br><br>  <b>Minuses:</b> <br>  ‚éØ By the way, your project is 80% due to rollback, and not because of your professionalism and knockout portfolio. <br>  ‚éØ At some point, the ‚Äúrecruited‚Äù manager by the client will really want to denyuzhku everyone ‚Äúin spite of‚Äù and ‚Äúdespite‚Äù.  And then he will absolutely do not care for the quality of the work you provide ... <br>  ‚éØ Manager - the position is not eternal.  They will dismiss the manager, ‚Äúleave‚Äù your future order.  And your ‚Äúfruitful Niva‚Äù will turn into ‚Äúunplowed virgin soil‚Äù, on which you will be very difficult to climb because of weak works. <br>  ‚éØ Compromising something you have, but you are also accomplices. <br>  ‚éØ Once opened, the deception will result in years of work on your own rehabilitation, which is more expensive than the cost of 10 projects. <br>  ‚éØ You stop receiving objective feedback.  Kickbacks kill her.  Their goal - to pass everything as quickly as possible, and saw bablos. <br>  ‚éØ You lose the feel of the market.  Working at an inflated cost, your self-esteem is growing unfairly, but you get used to it quickly. <br>  ‚éØ Conscience (even though I promised not to talk about the moral side of the issue).  When it finally comes to you that they work with you only thanks to kickbacks, you realize your emptiness and worthlessness.  This is similar to suicide, especially for people of creative professions. <br><br>  <b>Total</b>  <b>The conclusion is simple:</b> working with kickbacks in the short-term mode of personal development = it‚Äôs profitable to make some money, and work without kickbacks in the long-term mode = it is profitable to develop and grow financially and professionally. <br><br>  I will constantly add thoughts to this article, and I ask - share your "experience with kickbacks" in the comments, if any, or just an opinion on this issue.  With me roll back :). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/56171/">https://habr.com/ru/post/56171/</a></p>
