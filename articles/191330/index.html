Another thing when it comes to professionals "from the side" - such as <a href="http://www.axp.no/">Andres Overguard</a> .  Andres is a young Norwegian director, laureate of The International Horror and Sci-Fi Festival. <br><br><img src="http://cdn.conversations.nokia.com.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Anders-√òvergaard-Lumia-925.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Some may remember Andres' other work with our phone in the lead role - it was he who shot the video of the beautiful Audio District band with the help of the previous flagship, Nokia Lumia 920. <a name="habracut"></a>

At the age of 15, he began writing screenplays for his own films, at 16, he entered the college on the specialty ‚Äúmedia‚Äù and made his first mini-series, in which more than 40 actors took part.  Two years later, he made his own steadic, which turned out to be so convenient that Andres had to open his own production company.  Since then, he graduated from the Norwegian College of Arts and Cinema, shot several full-length tapes, more than two dozen short films, commercials and several documentaries. <br><br>  In his work, Andres mainly uses SLR cameras - Canon 5D and 7D, but recently he has been actively experimenting with mobile video shooting.  The first Nokia 808 PureView fell into his hands, and he was amazed at the quality of the shooting.  Since then, he has not missed a single model with PureView.  His last short film was shot on Lumia 925 - she became the reason for this article. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/1fk6EA-5HC8%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256&amp;usg=ALkJrhibVfKM4fOp6eQuXwuftQd1MPLXSw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Andres kindly agreed to answer some of our questions and share the secrets of shooting. <br><br>  <b>The atmosphere of the film is very realistic, as if you yourself are an observer of what is happening ... and she is rather creepy.</b>  <b>How did you manage to achieve this and what is the role of the Lumia 925 in this?</b>  <b>What was the source of inspiration?</b> <br><br>  My friend and I made some improvised films - we just took cameras, and the places for filming were searched ‚Äúon the go‚Äù.  When I see an unusual, strange or beautiful place, I try to convey the impression it caused me with the help of a camera.  I like to shoot in motion, from different angles, in order to focus the viewer's attention on different objects that I find interesting.  Improvisation and unexpected ideas can lead to excellent results! <br><br>  I think that filming in motion, the ambient sounds that I added, and the fact that the Nokia Lumia 925 shoots 30 frames per second, and give the viewer the feeling that he is part of the film.  25 frames per second gives a familiar cine picture, but shooting at a faster speed makes it more realistic - like Peter Jackson in his Hobbit, which he shot at 48 frames per second. <br><br>  <b>What do you think about the 925th as a camera for shorts?</b>  <b>What are your feelings from working with her as a camera?</b> <br><br>  Nokia Lumia 925 is very practical - first of all, because of its size.  It is convenient to shoot in narrow places and from unusual angles.  The first frame of the film would be much more difficult to shoot with a larger camera.  The dimensions of the 925th allow you to move very quickly, which, in turn, helps the actor to stay in the image without having to wait until you find the desired shooting point. <br><br>  There are, however, and minuses - for example, there is no fastening for a tripod or a rig, and rigs that make ‚Äúspecially for mobile‚Äù, as a rule, do not shine with quality.  I also miss the manual exposure settings and manual focusing paired with optical zoom.  I heard that in Lumia 1020 there will be these chips, so I am looking forward to it.  The rest of the phone shoots a really clear and high-quality video. <br><br>  <b>And what are its advantages and in which genres do they work best?</b>  <b>Maybe there are some chips that you would like to mark separately?</b> <br><br>  There is.  PureView and a large aperture - what you need during filming with a "difficult" light.  And there is no need to bother with the outside light when shooting in rooms - this is a very big plus. <br><br>  When shooting in 30 frames and a bunch of automation, I would call it the best camera for home video and documentary films. <br><br>  <b>Before that, you shot a clip from Nokia Lumia 920 - how does it differ from the 925th?</b> <b><br></b> <br>  Since the Lumia 925 is much easier, it is easier to install it in various rigs.  And the screen is brighter - easier to shoot in the sun. <br><br>  <b>What tips would you give to beginning filmmakers who would use the Nokia Lumia 925?</b> <b><br></b> <br>  Remember that you do not need the most expensive equipment in order to make movies with a good picture.  If you have a Lumia 925, try taking pictures with different light settings to understand how the camera adjusts itself to compensate for the light.  If the picture is too orange or white, try adjusting the white balance.  A great tip for cinematic images - move while shooting.  You can really increase the tension with a little movement, for example, right on the actor.  The stabilizer built into the Lumia 925, which will help you move without an abundance of shaking in the frame, will be a great helper here.  Good luck! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/191330/">https://habr.com/ru/post/191330/</a></p>
