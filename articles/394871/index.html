So, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/legendarylea/mobile%3Fmwcc%3Dredir_b">LegendaryLea</a> , a fairly popular gamer - a girl, received $ 250 during a game in Hearthstone.  Then another $ 250.  And yet ... Money went and went, and when the amount had already grown to $ 11,500, the girl stopped playing and danced.  Probably many would do the same?

      The amount of $ 11,500 is significant in any country.  Especially, if this money is donated.  They can pay to go to university, pay off a loan ... But you never know.  Approximately the same amount received by other streamers - <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/nosleeptv">NoSleepTV</a> , <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/sodapoppin">Sodapoppin</a> , and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/dizzykitten">Dizzykitten</a> .  The money was transferred by the user with the nickname iNexus_Ninja.  But the user did not do it out of good intentions.  He just wanted to joke and planned to return the money at the end of the month, canceling transactions in his PayPal account.  But the joke turned out really canceled - the company refused to return the money to this user. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zf5sBvfaI-Q%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhSNkH-6rT2W1c0eJW2otZjq5rkyg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  As it turned out, iNexus_Ninja is an 18-year-old resident of Australia, his name is Anthony Archer.  In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sodapoppin/comments/3zmiuv/inexus_ninja_attempts_to_chargeback_the_thousands/cynsved">remote tweet</a> , previously discovered by a Reddit user, it was said that Anthony used his parents' credit card to conduct transaction to tape drives. <br><br>  Interestingly, this is not the first such case.  Two years ago, someone with a nickname Amhai <a href="http://www.dailydot.com/esports/twitch-amhai-donor-warcraft/">sponsored</a> favorite streamers worth $ 100,000.  He threw streamers at first $ 1,000, then the amount increased to $ 5000.  Well, at the end there were already transactions of $ 10,000, there were several such transactions.  Amhai was (and probably is) an amateur World of Warcraft: Mists of Pandaria, so the money was transferred exclusively to those streamers who played WOW.  One of the streamers received $ 30,000 from Amhai (several large transactions in a row), the other $ 50,000. <br><br>  The identity of this user, who became a legend, could not be established (remember, this happened in 2014).  It was rumored that this was an oil magnate from the UAE, but these are just rumors.  Initially, he threw a small amount, and looked at the reaction of the tape drive.  If he showed gratitude, and began to play even more professionally, the "tycoon" threw a large amount. <br><br>  Interestingly, the LegendaryLea streamer, which was discussed above, then received $ 22,000 from Amhai. <br><br>  But back to our troll.  What happened after PayPal refused to return funds to him? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ee7/cf6/16d/ee7cf616d82b31d06c7e52ec2e7ef705.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Yes, mom smacks companion troll in the basement.  For $ 50,000, the punishment will probably last a long time.  But even this did not prevent him from distributing codes for games to everyone. <br><br><twitter-widget class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered" id="twitter-widget-0" style="position: absolute; visibility: hidden; display: block; transform: rotate(0deg);"></twitter-widget><blockquote class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-error" data-lang="ru" data-twitter-extracted-i1551435245377494556="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">  Last 10 <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TheDivision%3Fsrc%3Dhash">#TheDivision will not be released</a> in 10 hours.
