    <h3>  What is stuffiness? </h3><br>  Everyone knows that oxygen is needed for breathing.  Many believe that the stuffiness in the room comes because the room breathed out some of the oxygen;  and airing is necessary so that a new one comes from the street. <br><br>  In fact, it is not. <br><br>  The average person consumes oxygen ~ 1 kg / day (or ~ 1/2 g / minute). <br><br>  In the middle room (3x5x2.6 = 40), under normal conditions (O <sub>2</sub> content 0.28 kg / m <sup>3</sup> ), breathe oxygen to a level as low as high in the mountains, one person must breathe for a week. <br><br>  In reality, it is not difficult to make sure that baking in a room for a week will not work.  If a person closes hermetically in the bedroom, he will hardly spend one night.  After a few hours, sleep will become restless, there will be an increasing sense of stuffiness.  Day in such a room will be torture - not allegorically, but in the most literal sense.  A person will be physically very bad. <br><br>  It's not about oxygen, but carbon dioxide, which a person exhales in return. <br><br><h3>  How much CO <sub>2</sub> does a person emit? </h3><br>  In the fresh air, the content of CO <sub>2</sub> ~ 0.04% (0.5 g / m <sup>3</sup> ). <br><br>  With an increase in the content to 0.7% and further, it is more difficult to ignore the stuffiness.  This is not just psychological discomfort, but also noticeable physiological changes (from 1%): an increase in the frequency and depth of breathing, an increase in pressure, heart rate, increased sweating;  the number of errors in difficult work increases, the headache begins, the maximum concentration becomes unattainable (from 2%).  In civilian research do not experiment with content above 2.5%. <br><br>  It is clear that after consuming 1 kg of O <sub>2</sub> , the human will exhale about 1.4 kg of CO <sub>2</sub> . <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Why not exactly?</b>  <b class="spoiler_title">Is the lungs not a kind of catalyst?</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  When 1 O <sub>2</sub> molecule is absorbed from air, doesn‚Äôt exactly 1 CO <sub>2</sub> molecule be released? <br><br>  From the point of view of biological mechanisms, this is not necessarily the case.  In erythrocytes, these processes are separated.  One system captures oxygen, the other emits carbon dioxide. <br><br>  And in reality, oxygen molecules are captured more than carbon dioxide is released. <br>  The easiest way to understand this is if you pay attention to fats (in the food of our model person).  According to their composition, they can be considered as CH <sub>2</sub> . <br><br>  In addition to 1 oxygen molecule, in order to oxidize a carbon atom, we will need one more additional oxygen atom to oxidize hydrogen.  In general, oxygen will be consumed in one and a half times more than carbon dioxide exhaled. <br><br>  However, for carbohydrates and proteins, this ratio is close to 1: 1; therefore, for simplicity, the ‚Äúcatalyst‚Äù approximation of respiration is considered further. <br></div></div><br>  In our walled room, 40m <sup>3</sup> in volume, with initially perfectly fresh air, in 20 minutes a person will double the ‚Äúnatural‚Äù CO <sub>2</sub> content.  Overnight 20+ times - up to 1%.  Per day up to 3%. <br><br><h3>  NASA and US Navy CO <sub>2</sub> Standards </h3><br>  In mortal life, such walled places where the window is not open, but you have to work for many days in a row, are submarines. <br><br>  Submariners are much more than astronauts.  And their work is no less difficult and responsible.  So there is a large and high-quality statistics. <br><br>  When developing space-based regeneration systems, they are guided by this experience, but the standards for astronauts put more humane ones, NASA decided to take a 1/3 multiplier for long periods: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hq/fs/oy/hqfsoy0di0skhrl6gbkfsbvtl8g.jpeg" alt="Permissible concentration of CO <sub> <small> 2 </ small> </ sub> depending on the time of stay."><br><br>  That is 0.8%. <br><br>  However, in reality, NASA is trying to keep the level on the ISS not higher than 0.5%.  The fact is that even at this level, individual astronauts are beginning to experience discomfort, - psychologists at MCC notice that people's behavior noticeably changes, even if they themselves do not complain. <br><br>  And there is a need: how to maintain low CO <sub>2</sub> content in the air? <br><br><h3>  0th generation - blowing </h3><br>  Historically, this is the first solution, because the simplest. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/6h/aa/sc/6haasc9qgumui-q5vt4xlqa3nfm.jpeg" alt="First, even on the umbilical cord, Leonov"><br><br>  There is just a gradual purging with oxygen of the atmosphere of the spacesuit.  Carbon dioxide released during breathing is released into the vacuum - along with the rest of the mixture.  Where there is still a lot of oxygen that could breathe. <br><br>  It is clear that as a standard system, this existed only at the very beginning of the space program. <br>  Now this system is used only as a duplicate system in space suits.  That is, in the event of a malfunction of the main system (see below, the next generation), or as an emergency extension in time, when the main system is already exhausted and the astronaut did not have time to return.  The estimated time of such a backup system in a modern spacesuit is half an hour. <br><br>  To make it clear how inefficient such a system is: over the course of half an hour it will be spent on blowing 1.2 kg of oxygen, of which a person will assimilate 15-20 grams.  Efficiency less than 2%. <br><br><h3>  I generation - the famous "checkers" for air </h3><br>  This regeneration system became main almost immediately - and it remained such a decade. <br><br>  It was used by both the first man on the moon and the last people on the shuttles (although by that time on the ISS, and before that on the Mira, and even on the Skylab, the next generation was already used as a standard version, see below). <br><br>  The air chases through a closed loop, without dumping out.  The loss of oxygen is compensated by the fact that oxygen is mixed in from cylinders (or, later, from electrolysis of water), and lithium hydroxide tanks are used to remove CO <sub>2</sub> : <br><br>  2LiOH + CO <sub>2</sub> ‚Üí Li <sub>2</sub> CO <sub>3</sub> + H <sub>2</sub> O <br><br>  Carbon dioxide is bound to lithium carbonate.  Formally, in this reaction, water is released, which could (theoretically) try to extract, and decompose into hydrogen and oxygen, which is reused. <br><br>  In reality, after using the checker, with all its contents, it goes into the trash.  Because of its compactness, such a system is used as a regular system in all modern spacesuits and delivery vehicles (Soyuz, future American ones).  Because of its simplicity and reliability, such a system is considered as a spare / supplementary one on the ISS - if the standard system fails;  if there are too many people at the station and the main system fails. <br><br>  When the shuttle was still flying to the ISS, each of which had a whole mob, and all of them spent more time at the station than the calculated flight of the shuttle - the two full-time ISS systems (Russian and American) were not enough, they constantly ‚Äúburned‚Äù their checkers on the shuttle, and then another significant portion of the stock of checkers on the ISS.  Then, on the cargo ships, they added new ones. <br><br>  Modern American checker contains 3 kg of LiOH, <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/uq/h-/od/uqh-odappngf4xiaxn2bcov8wyg.jpeg" alt="Scrubber"><br><br>  Russian 5 kg. <br><br>  With checkers, ideally, much less is irreplaceably lost: carbon dioxide collected by checkers;  checkers themselves.  (And, if you produce oxygen from water, the hydrogen released from the water, it also goes overboard.) <br><br>  In this case, the biggest waste in weight is the checkers themselves.  And you can somehow without spending drafts? <br><br><h3>  II generation - regular mode of the ISS </h3><br>  If it is very rough, then this is an improved cat tray with a filler. <br><br>  We have a substance that is well impregnated with gas - but not by any, but depending on the diameter of the molecule.  Carbon dioxide is captured, there is almost no nitrogen and oxygen.  That is, we have before us the so-called "molecular sieve".  Since the time of Skylab, this is <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A6%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D1%258B">zeolite</a> . <br><br>  So that the zeolite does not get wet (at the station is normal humidity, each person exhales a liter of water per day), first the air is dried.  Cools down.  And served in the chamber with zeolite. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fd/bz/ue/fdbzue2we5zxcfyaz3gnp1czqmu.jpeg" alt="On the example of the new system"><br><br>  There are two such cameras (in the American system), or three (in Russian).  For a while, one of the chambers absorbs carbon dioxide, then the air flow switches to the second.  At this time, vacuum is injected first, and the zeolite is heated.  Carbon dioxide comes out of it.  This is one cycle.  Now we can again use the first chamber to clean the air, and put the second one on weathering in a vacuum. <br><br>  Ideally, you only take carbon dioxide from the atmosphere of the ISS.  This is your irrecoverable loss (this gas you send overboard) - but the adsorbents themselves are used many times, unlike cat trays or systems on drafts.  (And of course, you continue to throw hydrogen overboard, as a by-product of electrolysis when you receive oxygen.) <br><br>  Question: what if throwing carbon dioxide overboard was a pity?  He's two-thirds more than oxygen! <br><br><h3>  Generation 2.5 - experimental, unsuccessful </h3><br>  The system was tried to be developed for Mira, but nothing good came of it. <br><br>  On the one hand, we must pay tribute to the courage of Soviet engineers.  If the system were to work, it would be a complete closure of the oxygen cycle. <br><br>  On the other hand, it is impossible not to remember the classic one - ‚ÄúMy dear, are you going to burst?‚Äù Perhaps, if the efforts were directed at a less ambitious task (Americans from the very beginning did all the work on this less ambitious task, although they had far more resources ), then the Soviet engineers would have perfectly decided it, and the systems of the third generation would have been successfully used for thirty years. <br><br>  What is the idea.  To convert carbon dioxide into oxygen, the so-called Bosch reaction can be used: carbon dioxide is mixed with hydrogen, and at high temperature carbon dioxide is first reduced to carbon monoxide, and then carbon disintegrates to atomic carbon on the catalyst.  It turns out water (steam), and carbon in the form of sediments: <br><br>  CO <sub>2</sub> + 2H <sub>2</sub> ‚Üí C + 2H <sub>2</sub> O <br><br>  Already from the description of the reaction is visible and the main difficulty: the reaction is on the catalyst, which is covered with a touch of graphite.  And what to do? <br><br>  First of all, cleaning is difficult and expensive (expensive in the cosmic sense: additional equipment is required, and consumables, and the cost of useful mass for this is greater than the gain in stored oxygen). <br><br>  Secondly, these cleanings should be very frequent - if there are three crews, then 1 kg of graphite should settle on the catalyst per day. <br><br><h3>  3rd generation - fresh </h3><br>  From the very beginning, the Americans decided not to do Bosch‚Äôs reaction, but Sabatier‚Äôs reaction.  It is often called the Sabatier reactor, since the reaction requires not only high temperature, but also increased pressure. <br><br>  The reaction goes on the catalyst, hydrogen is added to carbon dioxide, that is, the reactants are similar to the Bosch reaction, but the reaction is different: <br><br>  CO <sub>2</sub> + 4H <sub>2</sub> ‚Üí CH <sub>4</sub> + 2H <sub>2</sub> O <br><br>  water and methane. <br><br>  The technological advantage of Sabatier to Bosch is that all products are gaseous and it is easy to continue working with them.  In the variant that has now been delivered to the ISS, methane is simply emitted to the outside (as in systems of the 2nd generation carbon dioxide is emitted to the outside). <br>  But there is a minus.  Recall where the new oxygen comes from at the station.  Decomposition of water. <br>  Oxygen is used, and hydrogen (in systems of the 2nd generation) is simply thrown overboard.  Now we can (and should! Take the hydrogen for the reaction from somewhere) to use this hydrogen, sending it to the Sabatier reactor. <br><br>  And then the nuance.  In water, there are 2 hydrogen atoms per 1 oxygen atom.  And in the Sabatier reaction, 4 oxygen atoms must fall on 1 oxygen atom (2 goes to replace the bond of oxygen with carbon, and 2 more hydrogen is molded to this separated oxygen to form water). <br><br>  Thus, if you rely only on the electrolysis of water and the Sabatier reactor, the oxygen cycle can be closed only by 50%.  Half of the CO <sub>2</sub> can be recycled, and for the remainder, there is no hydrogen anymore. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tq/66/zz/tq66zzlbbz7ckh3dk5wy4fr6wyq.jpeg" alt="Block diagram after the addition of the reactor Sabatier"><br><br>  (If you are a little confused at this point, do not be discouraged. Even the authors of the first press releases on the ESA website did not immediately realize what was happening, and at first they drew the wrong flowcharts and threw everything at the catalyst's inefficiency.) <br><br>  In reality, of course, so far not a theoretical 50% is obtained, but smaller, about 40%.  At the beginning of the article, only the Sabatier reactor itself is shown, an element of innovation ‚Äî in the block laugh it is around the green arrow. <br><br>  The whole system is entirely much larger - just like the one that the Americans had had before.  For the full scientific stand, half a ton. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ed/ev/xf/edevxfwk-tdvr236pdsnahap8hi.jpeg" alt="Gerst depicts, as if he was overwhelmed with a ton of iron"><br><br><h3>  Prospects IV generation - the development of III generation? </h3><br>  The question immediately arises: why not use additional hydrogen?  Delivered to the ISS in addition to the water we allow for electrolysis? <br><br>  Indeed.  Consider the part of CO <sub>2</sub> that has to be thrown into a vacuum.  For every 12 mass of carbon, we lose 32 mass of oxygen.  And if we add the missing hydrogen to the reactor, and we bind carbon in CH <sub>4</sub> , the oxygen will remain at the station, and in the exhaust we will lose only 4 mass of hydrogen.  The weight gain is 32: 4 = 8 times.  1 kg of hydrogen would save as much as 8 kg of oxygen! <br><br>  The problem is that hydrogen is not water.  This can be used to transport water conventional containers.  For simplicity, we put on the container 1/10 of the weight of the delivered water. <br><br>  In the case of hydrogen, although compressed, even liquefied, everything is just the opposite: the ratio of the mass of the container to the mass of hydrogen contained in it will be ~ 10/1. <br><br>  We cannot deliver just a kilogram of hydrogen to the ISS.  We still have to lift 10 kilograms of his container. <br><br>  Not to mention the need to solve safety problems along the way: when hydrogen is stored, there is a regular leak at the valves (if delivered as gas), and a similar dump at the containers (if liquefied), due to the need to maintain a low temperature inside.  In addition to the danger, these leaks still make it impossible to store in reserve for a long time.  Bleed hydrogen must either be used immediately or irretrievably lost. <br><br>  The result is that it will be easier (and more economical) to deliver to the ISS not additional hydrogen for the Sabatier reactor, but additional water for electrolysis.  And work in a half-closed cycle, throwing excess carbon dioxide into a vacuum. <br><br><h3>  Prospects of the fourth generation - another development from the second generation </h3><br>  While it was about closing the system only in oxygen.  Carbon was considered as a useless element, inevitably entering the system (through people's breathing) from food.  We did not take into account the mass consumption of food, which is constantly introduced into the air regeneration cycle. <br><br>  And what if you still try to save carbon?  What if oxygen is extracted from carbon dioxide, binding carbon not to methane, but to carbohydrates? <br><br>  Carbohydrates, if you look only at the number of components of chemical elements, is approximately equal to the mixture of carbon and water. <br><br>  Recall the atomic masses of the participants: hydrogen - 1, carbon - 12, oxygen - 16. <br><br>  Let's compare the effectiveness of the considered methods of carbon sequestration, in terms of the mass of substance discharged into the vacuum (which must be raised to the station from the ground before!): <br><br><ol><li>  When all CH <sub>4 is</sub> dumped overboard (and hydrogen is sent there from electrolysis), we lose two water molecules for each carbon atom, that is, for 1 mass of carbon 3 mass of water. </li><li>  During the Sabatier reaction (due to the lack of hydrogen), we lose by the water molecule for each carbon atom, that is, for 1 mass of carbon, 1.5 mass of water </li><li>  When converting to carbohydrates, we spend on the water molecule for each carbon atom, that is, for 1 mass of carbon, 1.5 mass of water. </li></ol><br>  As you can see, the electrolysis + Sabatier cycle has the same efficiency as the electrolysis + carbohydrate cycle. <br><br>  But!  In the reaction of Sabatier, we drop this substance from the station, lose it irrevocably.  And carbohydrates - you can try to make them suitable for food? <br><br>  Astronauts should have in their food not only carbohydrates (for simplicity, 400 grams), but also fats (100 grams) and proteins (100 grams).  Because of this, to close the cycle on oxygen and nutrition, making only carbon dioxide from carbon dioxide, will not work.  But to replace at least the carbohydrate part of the products?  This is 2/3 if by dry composition! <br><br>  Then the final balance will change: <br><br>  - on the one hand, we reduce the waste of water by 3 times compared to the cycle through Sabatier (from 560 grams to 165, this is for binding in carbohydrates of that carbon, which came from eaten proteins and fats, its 110 grams; theoretically, even these 165 grams water can not be written off, and save sugar on board, but it will simply not be in demand for the cycle, the stock of pure carbohydrates will accumulate) <br><br>  - plus to this, the consumption of food (by dry composition) becomes less by 400 grams per person / day (we closed the food cycle for carbohydrates). <br><br>  In total, a gain of ~ 700 grams per person per day. <br><br><h3>  What to expect </h3><br>  To sum up: NASA, ESA see the prospect in returning to the previous regeneration system (through adsorbers without Sabatier reactor) - only now, when unloading the adsorbent, use not laboratory vacuum, but open.  Closed vacuum chambers from which carbon dioxide is pumped out and stored to direct it to the production of carbohydrates. <br>  And there remains a mere nothing: how to convert carbon dioxide into carbohydrates? <br><br><ol><li>  You can try to do it purely chemically.  But it is difficult.  If it were simple, we would have long since taken sugar and bio-feed not from the plantations, but from extensions to power plants. </li><li>  You can try to do it biologically, through photosynthesis, but not everything is smooth here either. </li></ol><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Housekeeping note: how many indoor plants do you need so that you can never air out?</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Sometimes ordinary people, lovers of house plants, suddenly ask themselves such a question.  And well-wishers offer them sheets of confused calculations - which begin with the multiplication of reference data: the average inspiratory volume, the average number of breaths per minute, the proportion of carbon dioxide in the exhaled air ... In fact, the answer suitable for practical mind is very simple.  And completely deprives of enthusiasm.  It should be a plantation of such size that you collect ~ 800 grams of dried leaves (per person, depending on how much he eats).  And if these people are six or ten?  And the plantation must be built not in the backyard, but in orbit?  And then accelerate it to Mars, and slow it down from Mars, and somehow lower it down;  and lift again to fly back to Earth? <br></div></div><br>  Here, the plans of the agencies either really diverged, or the management decided to play in a healthy competition, and not put all the eggs in one basket.  (This is always a good option, and especially - when you have experience with the competition of Sabatier and Bosch reactions before your eyes. One took off, the other did not.) <br><br>  NASA <a href="https://www.co2conversionchallenge.org/image/other/CO2CCFAQs.pdf">announces contests</a> with millions of prizes in which it offers to produce sugar in purely chemical ways. <br><br>  ESA promises to raise an algae tank to the ISS as early as next year, and feed them with carbon dioxide, which is now excessive for the Sabatier reactor. <br><br><h3>  And if with carbohydrates from carbon dioxide nothing will come of it? </h3><br>  You can also try to make carbohydrates and hydrogen from methane and water.  NASA chose carbon dioxide as a starting point to catch two birds with one stone: this solution can be useful not only for closing the regeneration cycle in flight, but also for the active growth of matter on the planet - in the atmosphere of Mars, where there is CO <sub>2</sub> .  And here, on Earth, it would be useful. <br><br>  But most likely, the Sabatier reactor circuit will remain the most efficient - and, given the real speed of progress in manned space technology, by decades. <br><br>  <b>comparison table</b> <br><table border="1"><tbody><tr><th>  generation </th><th>  CO <sub>2</sub> removal method </th><th>  loss <sup>1</sup> <br>  (/ person / day) </th><th>  as a regular system </th><th>  as a spare <br>  / add. </th></tr><tr><td align="center"></td><td align="center">  blowing </td><td align="center">  50 kg O <sub>2</sub> compressed <sup>2</sup> </td><td align="center"></td><td align="center">  space suits </td></tr><tr><td align="center">  I </td><td align="center">  LiOH Checkers </td><td align="center">  1.1 kg of water <br>  1.5 kg of checkers </td><td align="center">  space suits, <br>  delivery ships ("Soyuz", future American, <br>  last shuttles) </td><td align="center">  ISS </td></tr><tr><td align="center">  II </td><td align="center">  molecular sieve <br>  evaporation into vacuum </td><td align="center">  1.1 kg of water </td><td align="center">  ISS <br>  (in the past "Peace", <br>  Skylab - for the first time) </td><td align="center"></td></tr><tr><td align="center">  <strike>III</strike> </td><td align="center">  molecular sieve <br>  decomposition to graphite </td><td align="center">  0 <sup>3</sup> </td><td colspan="2" align="center">  (experimental, <br>  unsuccessfully) <br>  for "Peace" </td></tr><tr><td align="center">  III </td><td align="center">  molecular sieve <br>  50% in CH <sub>4</sub> </td><td align="center">  0.6 kg of water </td><td align="center">  ISS (amer.

Even when systems trying to close this cycle are used to the maximum on the ISS, the effectiveness of these systems is limited: from a few kilograms of water and food, ~ 80% of water can be returned to the cycle.  That is, the loss of ~ 1 kg per person per day.  (This is not counting the container in which the food goes. Not all of it is sublimated in tea bags. There are also ordinary cans.) <br><br>  Thus, it is pointless to make absolutely fantastic efforts, trying to further improve the system of regeneration of CO <sub>2</sub> , until the losses in the toilet cycle are reduced. <br><br>  Therefore, the real goal that NASA is setting itself is to bring the system from the current 40% to 75%. <br><br>  But even if it turns out both of these cycles to close to zero, or almost to zero, and that's not all.  It will <b>not</b> mean at all that a person can <b>fully work</b> in a closed cycle in oxygen and water. <br><br>  Each exit to the open space is the inevitable loss of water.  It is used to cool the spacesuit.  Although at first glance it may seem that the spacesuit itself, and the ‚Äúbackpack‚Äù of the life support system are completely covered with thermal insulation - no.  The lower end of the "backpack", which ends under the astronaut's ass, is not covered.  This is a radiator cooler, and in the radiator pores, where water is supplied to the external circuit - for evaporation.  For one exit, depending on the duration, ~ 1-2 kg per exit participant is lost. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/429710/">https://habr.com/ru/post/429710/</a></p>
