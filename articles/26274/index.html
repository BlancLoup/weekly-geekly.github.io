Well, let's try to present our own development of the ad service, created from scratch. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>A bit of history</b> <br>  Here's how often do you come across buying / selling in your life?  I do not mean buying new things in the store.  It will be about the so-called secondary market for goods.  Do you sell an old car, mobile phone, bike, fridge?  How to do it?  Where to advertise?

      During the absence of the Internet, there were newspapers for this.  Either the ad section in the newspaper, or the entire newspaper dedicated to ads, the peak of which fell on the 90s of the last century.  A printed publication for placing ads has a number of drawbacks - there is no possibility of instant publication, a limited audience and the high cost of placement.  You can argue - because there are newspapers free ads!  Of course, but free cheese exists only in a mousetrap, and I think we all know it. <br><br>  With the development of the Internet, a huge number of so-called ‚Äúbulletin boards‚Äù began to appear in it: everyone tried to occupy a trendy and beautiful domain, hang more banners and make a free advertisement board.  The number of such boards today exceeds all reasonable limits, in addition, there are "services" for the publication of your ads on thousands of bulletin boards at once.  It led to a big dump. <br><br>  No, among all this were (some still exist) worthy resources.  But I want to note that the sale in auction format is not suitable for Russia.  Many publications also began to learn the Internet.  Unfortunately, not entirely successful - most of them closed. <br><br>  But we, as a consumer of services, are not concerned about this.  You did sell an old mobile phone in your life?  Of course sold.  Where on the Internet can this be done?  And if you consider the factor of your geographic location?  After all, at first glance, it seems that the Internet in Russia is only Moscow, St. Petersburg and some other million-plus cities.  So for the sale of an old mobile phone, you can go to the big bulletin board, to the site dedicated to mobile phones or to the site of your hometown, on which a section ‚ÄúBuy - Sell‚Äù is located in the corner of the forum.  At each of these sites you need to register (if you haven‚Äôt done this before), confirm your account (spam is being fought everywhere now) and then place your ad.  Under favorable circumstances, you will sell your mobile phone, but your ad (with contact information, phone and email) will need to be deleted later manually (if possible) from each site where you posted it.  No, of course, you can forget about it, but do not be surprised when your new friend, who knows only your email address, easily recognizes your phone, simply through an ordinary search engine. <br><br>  You will say - yes, I will throw the phone easier than I will solve all these problems.  Perhaps you will be right, but some things, not even new ones, cost a considerable amount of money to throw them away.  Car, apartment, cottage - also throw? <br><br>  And if you look at the problem from the other side?  You are the buyer.  Looking for a specific product model.  This often happens, especially considering that by and large, in Russia, demand still exceeds supply.  The problem will be that you will find more old and irrelevant proposals. <br><br>  <b>Idea</b> <br>  Once again faced with this problem in their own skin, it was decided to correct the situation.  The main idea was that by <b>creating a single database of ads, display its part on each thematic or regional site.</b>  Thus all problems are solved.  Placing an ad from one of the partner sites, it will be visible to absolutely everyone.  And the buyer will definitely find what he needs.  The work began ... <br><br>  The development took exactly one year.  The project was created from scratch.  The interface was drawn and designed, existing solutions were analyzed.  The task was to make it as simple and convenient as possible.  And take into account all the existing shortcomings in the already implemented projects on this subject.  The country of use is Russia. <br><br>  Through the affiliate program, we get the maximum possible coverage of all cities and thematic resources.  Sophisticated interface improves usability of the service.  Most of the implementations presented on the Internet are copied by carbon paper from each other, even without taking into account the existing shortcomings.  We realized the possibility of publications without registration, it is very convenient.  We have introduced a limited period of placement, and are not trying to dial a six-figure number of the number of ads, proudly stating - and here are how many ads!  But we always have fresh and relevant offers.  We use captcha to close the contact information of the seller.  We have a unique offer for placing commercial ads.  We have no spam.  And the best prices with instant payment available to everyone.  Payment is to some extent symbolic, it is she who plays the most important role in spam filtering.  And we have no banner and contextual advertising.  After all, the service is an advertising platform, what else can there be advertising on it? <br><br>  <b>Result</b> <br>  Made a huge amount of work.  Spent a huge amount of working time.  Not to mention how much money was spent.  We worked at night and on weekends, adjusted and tested, wrote documentation, conducted negotiations ... We continue to work further. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.onbazar.ru/">www.onbazar.ru</a> <br><br>  Ps.  There are some interesting ideas for startups that I don‚Äôt have time for, but I would be happy if someone does it.  I will share ideas as soon as possible. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/26274/">https://habr.com/ru/post/26274/</a></p>
