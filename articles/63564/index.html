I warn you at once: ‚Äúliterally many‚Äù, they will not master everything. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Who are these scary hackers?  This word originated in the 60s.  Then there were no computers in our understanding, but the craze for radio electronics began.  Many talented engineers (not by profession, but in life) discovered the boundless world of creativity.  The name of this world is ELECTRONICS.  With the help of a coil of wire and a handful of cheap parts, you can assemble a Tesla generator and surprise your friends at parties with fancy lightning.  And you can collect the simplest receiver and listen to conversations and music from the other end of the planet.  In the eyes of those around them, radio amateurs (and radio killers) have become such wizards.  Only their magic can comprehend and repeat each, it is enough to open a textbook and spend a few days or weeks following it.  In the film "Babylon 5" was a chic name - technomage.  It was these people who began to be called hackers.  They do not know anything supernatural, but they are doing just such things.  The boom of radio electronics began to subside with the advancement of personal computers to the masses (in the mid-90s), and with it the concept of ‚Äúhacker‚Äù began to fade. <br><br>  But, like a phoenix from fire, it was revived in a new guise, represented by computer specialists.  Computers are now perceived by most people as a box for accessing the Internet, searching for porn and for playing games.  For a hacker, however, a computer is much more.  This is his best friend or girlfriend, to whom he gives a name and sometimes even talks to him.  They are not schizophrenics, just a computer for them is akin to a dog or a hamster, for which they care.  Also, the computer is its library, where, with a skillful search, you can find almost any knowledge.  This is his battlefield, where he storms the "castles and bastions" of the defense systems of various servers.  It "breaks" other people's systems not to prank or to vandalize.  He is interested in the process of penetration, it is for him akin to the most interesting crossword or puzzle.  This is his world.  In it, he ‚Äúwalks‚Äù where he wants and any protection means a fence in the park, which can be climbed if it interferes with the walk.  Here is a curious wiki definition: <br>  1. A person who loves exploring the details (details) of programmable systems, exploring the issue of increasing their capabilities, as opposed to most users, who prefer to limit themselves to studying the necessary minimum.  RFC 1392 reinforces this definition as follows: ‚ÄúA person enjoying a thorough understanding of the internal actions of systems, computers, and computer networks in particular.‚Äù <br>  2. Someone programming enthusiastically (even obsessively), or loving to program, and not just to theorize about programming. <br>  3. A person capable of appreciating and understanding hacker values. <br>  4. A person who is strong in fast programming. <br>  5. An expert in relation to a particular computer program, or someone often working with it;  example: "Unix hacker".  (The definitions from the first to the fifth are interrelated, so that one person may fall under several of them.) <br>  6. An expert or enthusiast of any kind.  Someone might be considered an ‚Äúastronomy hacker,‚Äù for example. <br>  7. Someone who loves intellectual tests, consisting in creative overcoming or circumventing restrictions. <br>  8. Highly professional and curious programmer (administrator or others) characterized by original thinking.

      Everything is clear, except for paragraph 3. And what are the values ‚Äã‚Äãfor a hacker?  Many different definitions can be found, but the main values ‚Äã‚Äãare freedom!  Freedom of movement, freedom of information, freedom of reason from the framework of society, freedom, freedom, freedom!  Hacker not only must have a huge technical data.  A hacker is a state of mind and a certain mindset.  To understand hackers, you need to read and ponder on each line of the "hacker manifesto", which was written back in the 90s and which very clearly reflects the values ‚Äã‚Äãand thoughts of hackers.  The manifesto itself: <br>  <b><i>Another one caught today, it's in all the newspapers.</i></b>  <b><i>"A teenager is arrested for a computer crime", "A hacker is arrested for breaking a bank."</i></b> <b><i><br><br></i></b>  <b><i>Damn children ... They are all the same.</i></b> <b><i><br><br></i></b>  <b><i>But you, with your three-element psychology and the techno-brain of the 50s, did you ever look into the eyes of a hacker?</i></b>  <b><i>Have you ever wondered what makes him move, what forces have shaped him?</i></b> <b><i><br><br></i></b>  <b><i>I am a hacker, enter my world ...</i></b> <b><i><br><br></i></b>  <b><i>My world begins at school.</i></b>  <b><i>I am smarter than most other children, the nonsense that we are taught in school is boring.</i></b> <b><i><br><br></i></b>  <b><i>Damn stupid ... They are all the same.</i></b> <b><i><br><br></i></b>  <b><i>I'm in middle or high school.</i></b>  <b><i>I listen to the teacher, who for the fifteenth time explains how to reduce the fraction.</i></b>  <b><i>Yes, I understand already.</i></b>  <b><i>‚ÄúNo, Miss Smith, I will not show you my work.</i></b>  <b><i>I did it in my mind ... "</i></b> <b><i><br><br></i></b>  <b><i>Damn child, probably wrote off.</i></b>  <b><i>They are all the same.</i></b> <b><i><br><br></i></b>  <b><i>Today I made a discovery.</i></b>  <b><i>I opened the computer.</i></b>  <b><i>Just a second ... it's great!</i></b>  <b><i>He does what I want.</i></b>  <b><i>If he makes a mistake, it's because I screwed it up.</i></b>  <b><i>Not because he does not like me ... Or he is intimidated by me ... Or thinks that I am too clever ... Or does not like to study and should not be here ...</i></b> <b><i><br><br></i></b>  <b><i>Damn boy.</i></b>  <b><i>All he does is play games.</i></b>  <b><i>They are all the same.</i></b> <b><i><br><br></i></b>  <b><i>And it happened ... the door to the world opened wide ... the sent electronic impulse rushed along the telephone lines, like heroin through the veins of a drug addict, a refuge from everyday incompetence was found.</i></b>  <b><i>"This is it ... What I belong to" I know everyone here ... even if I have never met him, never spoke to him, and I can never hear him again ... I know all of you ...</i></b> <b><i><br><br></i></b>  <b><i>Damn kid, again takes the phone line.</i></b>  <b><i>They are all the same.</i></b> <b><i><br><br></i></b>  <b><i>You are ready to swear with your ass that we are all the same.</i></b>  <b><i>At school, we were all fed baby food from a spoon, at a time when we wanted a steak ... Those pieces of meat that we got, were chewed and tasteless.</i></b>  <b><i>We were dominated by sadists and ignored by the indifferent.</i></b>  <b><i>Those few who could teach something, found in us the desired students, but they were like drops of water in the desert.</i></b> <b><i><br><br></i></b>  <b><i>Now this is our world ... The world of electrons and switches, the world of beauty data.</i></b>  <b><i>We use existing systems without paying for what could be pretty darn cheap if it weren't ruled by dirty speculators, and you call us criminals.</i></b>  <b><i>We investigate, and you call us criminals.</i></b>  <b><i>We are looking for knowledge ... and you call us criminals.</i></b>  <b><i>We exist without color, without nationality, without religious strife ... and you call us criminals.</i></b>  <b><i>You build atomic bombs, you start wars, kill, cheat and lie to us, trying to make us believe that all this is for our own good, and we are already criminals.</i></b> <b><i><br><br></i></b>  <b><i>Yes, I am a criminal.</i></b>  <b><i>My crime is curiosity.</i></b>  <b><i>My crime is that I judge people not by what they look like, but by what they say and think.</i></b>  <b><i>My crime is that I am much smarter than you.</i></b>  <b><i>This is something you will never forgive me.</i></b> <b><i><br><br></i></b>  <b><i>I'm a hacker.</i></b>  <b><i>And this is my manifesto.</i></b>  <b><i>You can stop me, but you can't stop us all ... after all, we are all the same.</i></b> <b><i><br></i></b> <br><br>  Did you feel the unfamiliar smell of a parallel world where hackers live?  You are standing next to the door to this world and you can enter it only when your main value is not money, but FREEDOM!  When I listen to Kipelov's song ‚ÄúI am free‚Äù, I have goosebumps running around.  This song is a real hacker anthem. <br><br>  Now a little about the evolution of the hacker movement.  In the mid-90s, when the computers were large and the programs were small, the Internet was very young and very young.  After watching the cult film ‚Äúhackers‚Äù with friends, we gathered a group of good computer specialists and began to comprehend this new world.  I was the organizer, the ideological inspirer and the main driving force of our hacker group.  I had an "underground" nickname Technorat - technocrats.  As you know, a rat is a very intelligent animal that can crawl anywhere.  This nickname also symbolized that I could penetrate into any technogenic system.  Diving into the world of the hacker underground was exciting.  New knowledge, new acquaintances, new technologies, new music.  It was a different world.  Living among ‚Äúordinary‚Äù people, we felt ourselves living simultaneously in two different universes.  They even had their own symbols of belonging to the hacker world.  For example, in English, the ending "-s", which means the plural, is replaced by "-z".  It turns out "filez", "warez", "computerz".  The use of individual numbers as letters, which degenerated after a dozen years into distorting the inscriptions in CS.  For example: the digit "1" = "l", "3" = "e", "7" = "t".  The inscription "31337" meant the word "eleet" and symbolized belonging to the hacker elite. <br><br>  We "broke" servers around the world.  Moreover, the site about cats or flowers was more interesting for us than the Pentagon‚Äôs most secret server (I‚Äôll say right away, we didn‚Äôt climb there) if there was a more interesting protection system.  What did we then do with the hacked server?  And nothing!  Once, the actions of a Krivoruka member of one of our members led to a server crash, for which he received the same message from us.  Foreign servers entered and forgot about them, as a past stage.  If the server was Russian, then they sent a letter to the admin with a description of how to hack his server.  Usually such letters remained unanswered, but even thanked them a couple of times.  One administrator even asked to check his server ‚Äúfor strength‚Äù once again after eliminating the gaps. <br><br>  Because  the Internet was very expensive and not everyone could afford it, many of our team had to crack providers and steal passwords.  I found the vulnerability of two providers in our city and the guys started to get impudent, stealing Internet watches with impunity.  My recommendations to be careful did not lead to anything.  After some time, part of the team began selling "Internet-unlim".  This meant that for $ 80 (at a price of $ 2.5 per hour), they gave the person a dozen other people's passwords.  If the provider covered these passwords until the end of the month, another 10 were issued to the person. My request and the requirement of a part of our team to stop this outrage, split our team.  A few months later, ‚ÄúFraera‚Äôs greed was killed‚Äù and a part of our group was put in prison, and some innocent members of the team were also imprisoned.  The others stopped communicating with each other and the group disappeared.  Greed and thirst for money - this is the main opponent of the movement itself and the spirit of hacking. <br><br>  In the late 90s, there was the heyday of the hacker movement, the hacker culture.  Then a large number of ‚Äúpioneers‚Äù and crooks appeared who, from the elite of IT specialists, turned hackers into ordinary criminals in the eyes of society.  Gradually, the hacker movement stratified, transformed, and at the moment is a motley collection of computer scientists of various stripes.  At the moment, there are several types of groups: <br><br>  1. Phreakers.  These are electronic engineers, usually engaged in "bugs", telephony and other electronics.  By and large - this is the descendants of the first radio amateurs.  There are ‚Äúright‚Äù and ‚Äúwrong‚Äù, or ‚Äúgood‚Äù and ‚Äúbad‚Äù.  "Good" are engaged in the study of various systems (anti-theft, telephone, etc.) just for fun.  The "bad" are interested in the same only for the purpose of making a profit.  They collect ‚Äúbugs‚Äù and sell to those who wish, what the ‚Äúright‚Äù fricker will not allow itself.  The ‚Äúright‚Äù fricker will study the electronic travel system and, in the worst case, he himself will ride the subway for free, while the ‚Äúwrong‚Äù one will put the production and sale of cards as the goal of his business. <br>  2. Carders.  This word means all those who steal money from debit and credit cards.  The attitude of the rest of the hacker community to them is frankly negative, as contrary to the very name ‚Äúhacker‚Äù.  Carders are professional and amateurs.  Professional carders invent various screamers, ways to intercept card data, hack payment systems and databases of banks and stores to steal data, print duplicate cards and cash them.  Although a big mind in this matter is not required, it is enough the right organization.  If you have enough money, you can buy databases of card data stolen by others right on the card forums.  Depending on the amounts on the cards, their value may vary within very wide limits.  Usually "wholesale" cards are sold at a price of 5-20 dollars apiece.  It‚Äôs very difficult to get into serious Carder forums where there is no ‚Äúkidalov‚Äù and most likely no ‚Äúsent Cossacks‚Äù.  This usually requires a personal recommendation of someone from the members or elders of the forum and often the cost of the "entrance ticket" is 1-5 thousand dollars.  Some carders are engaged only in hacking various databases with the subsequent resale of information.  It is the safest, though less profitable.  Others buy card data and cash out.  Cashing is the most dangerous moment, because  during the cash withdrawal, they usually take ‚Äúwhite hands‚Äù.  If you made a duplicate card, then during cash withdrawal at an ATM, you "shine" your face.  In different banks, each ATM is equipped with from one to 3 !!!  cameras.  Even if attracted drunk, student or homeless for direct contact with an ATM, you still risk.  When the police "take" the executor, then according to his words, they will draw an identikit of the one who gave the task and in some years will unleash the whole chain.  Others cash money by buying various products in online stores.  Goods are sent to a rented apartment, where a dispatcher girl is sitting, and a courier student takes all the incoming goods once a day and refers them to a reseller.  In the end, take the girl-dispatcher or reseller, and again spun the whole group.  Still others use the services of reputable resellers.  In any country that does not cooperate with interpol, there lives a person who sells a product and sends carder 30-50% of the value of the goods.  There are a great many cashing and laundering schemes, but this is usually one of the types of earnings of organized crime. <br>  3. Crackers, crackers, crackers.  These people are engaged in hacking protection of various programs.  Some, such as the famous hacker, cracker and IT expert named Chris Kaspersky, hack into programs just for personal use or to learn interesting protection.  Moreover, they can then thank the author in writing for the pleasure he has delivered in breaking into such an interesting protection algorithm and BUY THE LICENSE COPY of the program as an incentive to the author.  Others (let's call them wrong) crackers put on a stream of hacking programs.  This is usually done for the sale of "cracks" or as an advertisement for your hacker group.  The attitude towards crackers in the hacker environment is ambiguous and depends on the cracker motives. <br>  4. Script Kiddies.  This is a huge population of blunt lamers who, as childish pranks, are engaged in massive deface of sites.  Because  they do not have enough of their knowledge to crack a serious security system, then they sit on hacker sites and forums in order to find or solicit a 0-day or private exploit.  When this gets into their hands, through Google there is a huge number of sites with the engine, under which the exploit was written.  Then comes the dumb consistent deface of dozens and hundreds of sites until you get bored.  Scripts at the dips sometimes get together in pseudo-hacker groups, a prerequisite for the existence of which is bad-mouthing of the same groups and ‚Äúmeasuring them with pussies‚Äù according to the number of sites that are identified.  On the part of the hacker community, such groups deserve only contempt, more than a teenager writing a sacramental three-letter inscription on the fence. <br>  5. Directly hackers, elite.  They are divided into 2 main groups: ‚ÄúBlack Hat‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhite Hat‚Äù.  The first is the elite with anarchic views.  They believe that the study is possible with any purpose and do not limit themselves to any framework.  Hacking servers can carry out for the purpose of narcissism, deface, expansion of a botnet, for commercial purposes.  They recognize only complete freedom without any moral restrictions. "The latter defend the ideals of real hackers and fight to ensure that the bright notion of the IT technology elite is not confused with cybercriminals. Having hacked the server, they write a letter to the administrator describing the vulnerability and if they know, they suggest the way If an error is found in the software, then the software company authoring the program is notified. In order not to hurt the server from the vulnerability and the company managed to release a patch to the program, hackers wait a month before publishing  vulnerability on security sites. At the request of the company, the nondisclosure period can be extended for the timely release and distribution of the patch. Also, ‚ÄúWhite Hat‚Äù is often employed by security auditors at the request of the company. Some ‚Äúfundamentalists‚Äù and orthodox supporters of hacker ideals protest against awarding in this case, although most hackers find this quite acceptable. <br><br>  You can select several more groups or divide along other grounds, but the main motto of the PRESENT hackers remains the same: ‚Äúa hacker is not the one who breaks, but the one who studies‚Äù. <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">PS I warn in advance possible questions. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I have not been doing this for a long time, although I have never stopped following the topic. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Now I work as an admin in a very large and serious office. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Therefore, do not even bother with requests to break anything, I will not undertake any money. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I respect the Criminal Code and the division "K" does not sleep.</font></font></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/63564/">https://habr.com/ru/post/63564/</a></p>
