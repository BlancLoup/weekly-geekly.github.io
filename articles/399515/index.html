  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Consumer basket of a black day: what is most often ordered on Black Friday from America</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Less than two days are left until Black Friday, and we decided to talk about what this date means in terms of <a href="http://pochtoy.com/%3Flang%3Drus%26utm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dgeeks16">mail forwarder</a> - i.e.  a company that is engaged in sending purchases from the United States to the countries to which the local stores officially refuse to deliver. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3c5/42d/3f1/3c542d3f10868a9356cf78f453953b53.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  How much the traffic of purchases from the USA to Black Friday is growing, what people buy most often, where to find really big discounts on expensive watches and a little disturbing observations about what this all leads to - in our review. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Due to the specifics of our business, the real analytics capabilities of shipments are quite limited: <a href="http://pochtoy.com/%3Flang%3Drus%26utm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dgeeks16">we</a> simply send purchases and are interested in their contents, if only there are any problems.  Therefore, we can only talk about the specifics of orders for Black Friday, which are made on the ‚Äú <a href="http://pochtoy.com/page/tariffs/">Full support</a> ‚Äù service, when we not only send goods to the customer, but also make the purchase for it (this is about 5% of the total number of parcels).

      The traffic on the ‚ÄúFull support‚Äù service on Black-Friday doubles.  It happened that tripled - but the last time it was observed in 2013.  The last two years there has been no such boom because of the crisis in the Russian economy. <br><br>  And the total number of packages that comes to our warehouse after Black Friday is 3‚Äì5 times more than in the standard flow. <br><br><h2>  So, what do people buy on Black Friday? </h2><br>  In general, the composition of purchases is no different from everyday: most of the purchases abroad are clothes.  Every year on Black Friday - a boom of orders for Timberland shoes, Levi's jeans and children's clothes.  Separately, there is a growing demand for goods for which there is almost no discount at other times - on the Neiman Marcus network of the Canada Goose brand: coupons with discounts up to 30% can be found on Black Friday.  We are talking about expensive brands: the very The North Face with a discount of $ 200 is very pleasant to buy. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/615/939/f34/615939f34a2dbc275c33e16ba68c3ee7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Among electronics, the demand naturally increases for discounted products, for example, old models of iPhones, which <a href="http://deals.ebay.com/tech/cell-phones%3F_sop%3D0">on eBay</a> can be found with a discount of twice and more. <br><br>  Be sure to order the watch, which usually cost $ 8-10 thousand (Cartier, Rado), but at a sale you can get them at a discount of 90% or more.  In order not to face fakes, you need to order on trusted sites like <a href="http://www.jomashop.com/">Jomashop</a> and <a href="http://www.ashford.com/">Ashford</a> : during sales and when they get rid of old collections, discounts can be huge. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ac6/05d/97c/ac605d97c2b74886a5d2c41eaf4a8438.png"><br><br>  In our practice, there was a case when a certain girl bought a watch, the catalog price of which was $ 10,000, for $ 800.  It is a good reason to once again think to what extent the price of an expensive watch is actually made up of the mark-up for the brand. <br><br>  Bicycles - another regular purchase from the US, which is delivered through us.  Most often, people order bicycles entirely from $ 500 to $ 1,500 from <a href="http://www.bikesdirect.com/">www.bikesdirect.com</a> and <a href="http://rbikes.com/">rbikes.com</a> , but on Black Friday for some reason they are actively starting to take individual frames - every year a minimum of 1-2.  Once we sent a titanium frame worth $ 2,600.  And among the accessories - a special demand for all production SHIMANO. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8d0/956/1ac/8d09561acd066e6179a005d8cf26258c.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>And this bike <a href="http://www.bikesdirect.com/products/motobecane/fat-bikes/fat-bikes-sturgis-fatbikes.htm">also discount</a></i> <br><br><h2>  Black Days for Black Friday </h2><br>  And the last observation from our experience about the state of emergency: oddly enough, the number of stores participating in it is constantly decreasing.  This is happening against the background of how many retailers blur the very concept of Friday, starting sales on Thursday, Wednesday, a week before - or stretching it right up to December (as Amazon recently announced).  Last year, almost any brand did something, published catalogs with discounts.  This year, the number of stores actively participating in Black Friday decreased by about a third.  Sierra Trading has reduced the stock offer: Familiar to every American mother, the names of Children's place and Carters have simplified participation on Black Friday to a total discount on all products.  Maybe the phenomenon of Black Friday is starting to burn out and not everything is Black Friday more? <br><br>  Based on our observations in recent years, the situation in trade in the US market is far from being the most rosy.  Those who buy for a long time, observe how prices grow, and discounts decrease.  Some stores are closed, others merge into concerns;  discounts are standardized to a certain maximum, for which go less and less.  To support the feeling of celebration, networks like Walmart and Target buy the cheapest home appliances in China, and actively advertise these offers ‚Äúfor 10 bucks‚Äù.  These are our observations, not analysis - it would be interesting for us to understand the reasons for what is happening, and we are happy to read your thoughts on the topic in the comments. <br><br>  However, the format of pre-holiday sales does not threaten to die: there will always be, on the one hand, brands that need to get rid of stale collections, brands with high margins, which they can easily lose under the guise of a grandiose discount - and just brands that need to take their place on the market (for example, as we wrote <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/pochtoy/blog/282822/">in the last review</a> , Microsoft is luring customers of Surface products with discounts of $ 200-400, while Apple already is doing well, so any discounts are either retailers' initiative, or restored goods, or old  e models).  But the holiday of Black Friday, as it is now, can significantly fade in the coming years.  We will see. <br><br>  <b>Deliver parcels by mail:</b> <br><br> <a href="http://pochtoy.com/%3Flang%3Drus%26utm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dgeeks16"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/91a/388/404/91a3884042444f849c2fec2aa3d4cbce.png"></a> <br><br>  By tradition - a discount of $ 5 on the first order of delivery of <a href="http://pochtoy.com/%3Flang%3Drus%26utm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dgeeks16">Pochtoy</a> from the USA for all who read up to this place on the <b>supergeek</b> promotion code. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/399515/">https://habr.com/ru/post/399515/</a></p>
