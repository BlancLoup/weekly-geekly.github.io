      The openSUSE <b>Leap</b> distribution, in contrast to openSUSE <b>Tumbleweed</b> (rolling-release, a constantly updated distribution in the style of Arch Linux), is periodically released and is regular, recommended for beginners and experienced Linux users, developers, administrators and software vendors, as it turns out convenient and usable distribution and stable operating system. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In the latest openSUSE Leap 42.3 release, a variety of graphical desktops are available to choose from: KDE and GNOME, as well as MATE, Xfce, Enlightenment and Cinnamon.  The LXQt graphical environment is also present, but not available in the installer. <br><br>  openSUSE Leap 42.3 has a long-term KDE version for its flagship Plasma desktop software.  Plasma 5.8 LTS is the default desktop environment in openSUSE and has a rich, more stable performance.  New <b>Plasma 5.8.7</b> adds three months of new translations and corrections. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/27d/3d0/4cf/27d3d04cf0dd47a697d59065e2d526d6.png"><br><br><h2>  GNOME 3.20 </h2><br>  This is another version of the desktop that remains the same in openSUSE Leap 42.3.  Resilience to it provides privacy control to improve location access for each application, quick access to media controls directly from the shell, and keyboard shortcuts and gestures can be easily explored using new label overlapping windows.  Many GNOME applications have 'hot' windows for 3.20, including files, videos, photos, gedit, Builder, Maps and more.  In each application, the shortcut window can be opened from the application menu or with the keyboard shortcut 'Ctrl + /' or 'Ctrl + F1'.  GNOME can access Google Drive directly from the Files application in openSUSE Leap 42.3. " <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/8d3/999/e0c/8d3999e0cae1442aa471b0f9a44b94ff.png"><br><br>  Downloads openSUSE Leap 42.3 can be found on the <a href="https://software.opensuse.org/">official site</a> .  Users running openSUSE Leap 42.2 can upgrade to openSUSE Leap 42.3 using the upgrade instructions.  It is recommended to use a smooth upgrade to Leap 42.3.  Leap 42.2 completes maintenance within six months. <br><br><h2>  System requirements </h2><br>  Leap 42.3 requires at least a 1.6 GHz Pentium 4 processor or higher (Pentium 4 2.4 GHz, any AMD64 or Intel64 is recommended), from 1 GB RAM (recommended from 2 GB), from 3 GB on a hard disk (recommended from 5 GB).  Installation can be done from a DVD drive using a USB stick or booting over a local area network (PXE-boot).  Before installation, it is recommended that you read the release notes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/95a/7af/260/95a7af2606254bf4b29bd17255595db2.png"><br><br><h2>  What is openSUSE Leap 42.3 for the end user </h2><br><h3>  More service </h3><br>  Based on openSUSE Leap on SLE (SUSE Linux Enterprise) and adding more source code to Leap 42.2 from SLE 12, Leap 42.3 makes even more packages available from SLE 12 SP 3 and synchronizes several common packages. <br><br>  The joint code base allows openSUSE Leap 42.3 to receive advanced service and bug fixes from both the openSUSE community and SUSE developers. <br><br><h3>  Ready server </h3><br>  OpenSUSE Leap 42.3 offers the ability to install a server during installation.  Without a graphical environment, Leap server installation is ready to do everything you need.  Something as simple as launching the Web or Mail platform is easier than ever, as well as complex projects using virtualization technologies or containers.  For example, users looking for an 'Exchange-like' service can use the latest version of the Kopano collaboration platform, including support for Thunderbird, Outlook, and mobile email clients.  It's also good to remember that Leap and all other openSUSE and SLE distributions support the full-featured text mode installer, providing all the same features as the graphical installer.  The installer is fully capable of performing installations remotely using VNC or SSH, allowing you to configure your OpenSUSE Leap server without having to be anywhere near it. <br><br><h2>  Linux openSUSE Leap 42.3 for developers </h2><br><h3>  Containers and Container Applications </h3><br>  OpenSUSE Leap 42.3 comes with Docker 1.12, which is based on the recent implementation of Dockers runC and containerd to bring the latest orchestration functions, such as Docker Swarm.  Dockers containers and tools greatly simplify and speed up creation and management.  This release first includes Flatpak, a software utility for software deployment, package management, and application virtualization for Linux.  It provides a sandbox environment in which users can run applications in isolation from the rest of the system. <br><br><h3>  IDE and rigging </h3><br>  Leap 42.3 contains the finished Qt 5 GUI (5.6) LTS toolkit.  Qt 5.6 has some non-critical security fixes within Qt and in third-party libraries. <br>  Qt now detects deleted print queues using avahi.  This adds a delay when you first open the print dialog in the application.  If you do not have network print queues, and you find the delay too annoying, you can disable it by setting 1 as the value of the QT_DISABLE_PRINTER_DISCOVERY environment variable in the / etc / environment configuration file.  GTK 3.20, shared with SUSE Linux Enterprise 12 SP3, provides reliable and stable tools for building gtk-based applications.  GNOME Builder is offered as a powerful general-purpose environment for not only GTK based C, C ++, and Vala applications, but also many other languages.  For all your compilation needs, Leap 42.3 has gcc 4.8.5 as the default compiler, but gcc 5.3.1, 6.2.1 and 7.1.1 are also available for developers. <br><br><h3>  Languages ‚Äã‚Äãand Libraries </h3><br>  OpenSUSE Leap 42.3 includes older and newer programming languages.  Go 1.6.2, Python 2.7, Ruby 2.4 and Perl 5.18 are available in Leap 42.3.  This release of Leap introduces new major version libraries.  New features for libvirt 3.3.0 that provide batch processing and improve network performance for guests.  The functionality for the package manager is improved in libzypp (16.12).  Leap also has a well-installed GNU C library with Power 9 support. <br><br><h3>  Virtualization </h3><br>  OpenSUSE Leap 42.3 is full of virtualization solutions.  QEMU 2.9 provides an extremely efficient processor emulator that allows you to choose between simulating the entire system and running binary files for different architectures. <br><br>  VirtualBox 5.1.22 has a patch for changing the API in Leap 42.3.  OpenSUSE Leap 42.3 has the ideal base system for distributing applications that are easy to configure using YaST and gnome-boxes.  With openSUSE Leap 42.3, a system administrator can quickly and easily deploy solutions.  The release provides system administrators with several options that make it easy to maintain reliable operation of computer systems.  Build and manage Linux containers with Leap with Docker and LXC.  In addition, take control of Linux container images with the <a href="http://port.us.org/">Portus project</a> openSUSE <br><br><h3>  YaST is our everything </h3><br>  The YaST development experience brought tons of improvements for openSUSE Leap 42.3.  The YaST community is working hard to improve usability and continues to add new tools and modules to Tumbleweed and Leap. <br><br>  The list of improvements includes expanding the ability to configure and use Trusted Boot also for EFI systems, new features for network installation, improvements in YSST partitioning, and better integration with Systemd services. <br><br>  The most notable change is the updated desktop selection screen in the installer, which offers a fairer playing field for all graphical environments outside of KDE and GNOME. <br><br>  The installer no longer offers a predefined selection of ‚Äúsecondary‚Äù desktops, but relies on existing templates created and maintained by the enthusiasts of each graphics environment. <br><br>  Thus, the principle of "those who do, decide" ("those who do it, decide") now also controls the choice of available desktops.  AutoYaST is now more reliable, powerful and friendly than ever. <br><br>  In addition to faster installation in many situations and improved reporting on automatic partition sizing, service management has been moved to the first stage of AutoYaST, which opens the door to many new features for more flexible automatic scripts.  A new AutoYaST feature is its new integration with SaltStack and other configuration management systems introduced by the new addition to the Leap family: the yast2-configuration-manager management pack. <br><br>  Now AutoYaST can take care of the installation of the system (separation, network configuration, etc.), and then delegate the system configuration to one of the widely used external tools. <br><br><h3>  System management </h3><br>  OpenSUSE Leap has Samba 4.6.5 and comes with version 4.6.4 for security, which takes care of the absence of a vulnerability that uses remote code execution that allows an attacker to load the shared library into a writable share and then force the server to load and execute it. <br><br>  Systemd 228 remains in Leap 42.3 and received fixes from memory leaks, as well as improved rollbacks using openSUSE technology. <br><br>  MariaDB 10.0.30 and Linux binary archives will now always unfold in directories corresponding to their file name. <br><br>  MySQL 5.6.36 improved the performance of the thread_pool plugin, and authentication and connection initialization were transferred from the acceptor thread to the pool of worker threads that handle client connections. <br><br>  It is also worth remembering that openSUSE Leap uses RPM Delta for all maintenance updates, ensuring that the long bandwidth requirements for maintaining your Leap system are as low as possible. <br><br><h3>  How openSUSE Leap 42.3 is adapted to the language features of various regions in the world (Internationalization) </h3><br>  In this release, openSUSE uses the Weblate to coordinate the translation of openSUSE into more than 50 languages.  The openSUSE Weblate interface allows everyone (from dedicated translators to casual participants) to participate in this process and allows you to coordinate openSUSE transfers with SUSE Enterprise Linux, enhancing the interaction between the community and the corporation. <br><br>  Let me remind you that openSUSE is a Linux distribution.  Initially developed in Germany, but now it is owned by the American corporation Novell, Inc.  Distribution is widely used throughout the world, especially in Germany.  It was based on the <b>Slackware</b> distribution, but it was significantly reworked and is a separate distribution, different from the latter by the format of the packages, as well as by the YaST configuration and administration system.  Over time, SUSE has incorporated many aspects of <b>Red Hat Linux</b> (using the RPM system and / etc / sysconfig).  The release cycle of new versions is 1 year. <br><br>  The openSUSE project includes a wiki project, a portal for users, ‚ÄúBuild Service‚Äù for developers, an art project for designers, a mailing list and IRC channels in different languages, <a href="https://susestudio.com/">Suse Studio</a> for creating its own openSUSE. <br><br>  openSUSE is the first distribution to include Snapper in release 12.1.  openSUSE Factory also includes a snapper tool.  Snapper is a Btrfs file management tool, which is offered by default during installation for the root partition.  For the / home partition, by the way, XFS is offered by default. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/2b1/878/07b/2b187807b18b495c864f01185f57b30c.png"><br><br>  In addition to the obvious creation and deletion of snapshots, it can compare snapshots and correct the differences between them.  Simply put, it allows users to view old versions of files and discard changes.  Snapper is available as a command line tool and as a YaST module.  Other programs available C ++ library libsnapper. <br><br>  At the end of the article, I would like to note that in openSUSE it is also presented by the Argon, Krypton and GNOME Next projects, which form constantly updated distributions with the most recent experimental versions of the KDE and GNOME user environments.  The builds support both the creation of full-fledged installable configurations and work in Live mode, which allows you to become familiar with the trends of KDE and GNOME without installing and making changes to the production system.  At their core, Argon and Krypton resemble the KDE Neon project based on Kubuntu and are formed based on the current KDE Git repository slice.  Argon is based on the openSUSE Leap package distribution, and Krypton is built using the continuously updated openSUSE Tumbleweed repository, providing an opportunity to assess the current state of KDE development in both stable and openSUSE testing environments.  In addition to builds, the project also supports the KDE: Unstable: Frameworks, KDE: Unstable: Applications and KDE: Unstable: Extra package repositories, which can be used in your system to continuously monitor the development of KDE.  The GNOME Next iso image is built from tarballs with releases of the latest experimental GNOME branch. <br><br><h3>  useful links </h3><br>  <a href="https://forums.opensuse.org/">OpenSUSE forum</a> <br>  <a href="">Features_42.3 in English</a> <br>  <a href="https://news.opensuse.org/2017/07/26/refresh-of-linux-distribution-continues-leveraging-community-enterprise-benefits/">Benefits of updates</a> <br>  <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:NVIDIA_drivers">SDB: NVIDIA_drivers</a> <br>  <a href="https://forums.opensuse.org/showthread.php/438705-openSUSE-Graphic-Card-Practical-Theory-Guide-for-Users">Graphic Card Guide</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/334258/">https://habr.com/ru/post/334258/</a></p>
