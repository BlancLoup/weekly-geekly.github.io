The possibility of installing a second hard disk was also planned - the computer had a free internal 5 ‚Äùbay and an unsoldered interface for another HDD. <br><br>  The price of the Robotron CM 1910 in 1988 was 56873 German marks, a year later it dropped to 43969 marks, and in early 1990 this computer could be bought for 36,000 marks. <br><br>  However, the Robotron CM 1910 computer did not acquire a second hard disk, and other plans of the VEB Kombinat Robotron enterprise did not materialize.  On June 30, 1990, Kombinat Robotron was liquidated, and its divisions were transformed into joint-stock companies, which were also subsequently liquidated or sold. <br><br>  Companies are no more, but computers remain. <br><br>  In zero years, one copy of the Robotron CM1910 computer moved from the scientific institute to the previous owner, who saved him from an inevitable fate in the hands of scrap metal collectors.  But years passed, computers started hundreds of times faster, and the old Robotron began to take up too much space.  Yeah, as in advertising. <br><br>  And finally, the computer got to me. <br><br>  <b>Appearance</b> <br><br>  <i>Monitor.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6a7/114/be8/6a7114be80de076f27acc8367a9c5e22.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Computer Robotron CM1910 is equipped with a black and green 12 inch CRT monitor, the appearance of which is quite canonical.  On the front of the monitor, just below the screen of the cathode ray tube, there is a power indicator light and a brightness control knob. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7ad/f17/46e/7adf1746e6b04485c8258ccff41f2c01.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the back of the case there is a power on / off switch, a connector for connecting the power cable and a pair of fuses.  The case cover is made of metal (apparently for better shielding the user from X-rays) and has ventilation holes. <br><br>  <i>Keyboard.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6dd/fb1/2b1/6ddfb12b1062ecf3abcf875366a755f6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The keyboard is quite different from the standard: the CTRL and ESC buttons are located in a very unusual place, instead of the right ALT key there is the CL button.  The PF1-PF12 function keys were shifted three buttons to the right, and now some of them are located in the place where the INS, Home and PageUp keys are located on a conventional keyboard. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/746/00a/b58/74600ab5894778526e30146aa36dba7c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  There are twice as many LED indicators - three of them are usually located above the digital block of the keyboard, and three more - above the ALT1, ^ S and MOD 2 keys, just at the place where the familiar F1-F3 buttons were to be located.  Keyboard connector - Male DB9.  Body material - plastic. <br><br>  <i>System unit.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/345/731/712/345731712420aeb5aed20c5ef245e70c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The appearance of the system unit is practically no different from the usual IBM PC of the time.  The computer case of Robotron CM1910 is made of solid metal, and the front panel slightly yellowed from time is made of plastic.  On the front of the case, there are two 5.25 ‚Äú720Kb drives, a Reset button and HD, RUN, HALT and PWR ON LED indicators.  The side walls of the housing have air vents. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0d9/422/2ca/0d94222cac61ff7847393d96a8440b2f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Virtually all interface connectors, as well as the power button, are located on the back of the system unit.  Connector keyboard and graphics tablet for convenience displayed on the left side wall of the case. <br><br>  It should be noted that the system unit is quite heavy, its approximate weight is 22 kilograms. <br><br>  <b>Inside the system unit</b> <br><br>  After a long reflection on whether to take photos of the disassembled monitor and keyboard, it was decided that the insides of these devices are of no interest.  In fact, we have the most common monochrome CRT monitor, with high voltage inside, and a completely ordinary keyboard with a Soviet microchip under the case. <br><br>  But the inner world of the Robotron CM1910 system unit is quite different from the filling of the IBM PC, so it deserves special attention. <br><br>  So let's get started. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7e5/e86/6c0/7e5e866c09b02da3a6c8f13344e28ad7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  We unscrew the four screws on the sides on each side on the back of the case, remove the back panel.  We push the side walls of the case and, finally, remove the top cover. <br><br>  After removing four more screws on the sides, we remove the front panel, having previously disconnected the cable leading to it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ca2/da2/874/ca2da2874b263f87dc9f1ea0ee236d67.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In the foreground are (from left to right): <br><br>  Block floppy disk drive of two drives 5.25 "720Kb <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/538/638/c49/538638c4954e0117d8495e4785ee48fc.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  MFM Robotron K5504.20 hard drive with 20 MB. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e6e/6c3/5cc/e6e6c35cc20f39758f7a5e47e441aac1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Two power supplies.

The first slot is free, it is closed with an iron plug. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1db/adf/a40/1dbadfa40ce9603c8b91dc9f68367d44.jpg" alt="image"><br>  In the background, there are MMS16 modules installed in slots (7 pieces) and a third 400W power supply unit supplying the module boards and hard drives along the + 5V line. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/15e/480/52d/15e48052d8d2292a73c6a810145cd6ae.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The motherboard, as such, is missing.  All the main components of the computer (except power supplies) are interconnected using the MMS16 bus. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bd9/8bc/207/bd98bc2074598ea7553654b65d47321f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Each module has its alphanumeric designation in the <a href="http://www.tiffe.de/Robotron/">documentation</a> and performs the following functions: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4ff/f6a/66b/4fff6a66b724012593f6fa4d2ddb1fd2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d1b/36d/3a3/d1b36d3a33d913f9fe5f13a725480936.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <b>ABG K7075</b> is a CGA compatible video card.

The Centronics interface is the well-known parallel port, the V.24 is the serial Com port, but the IFSP and IFSS interfaces deserve special attention. <br><br>  <b>The IFSP interface</b> is the so-called radial parallel interface used in many printers and computers manufactured in the CMEA countries.  Allowed to use long connecting cables;  with Centronics interface is not fully compatible. <br><br>  <b>Interface IFSS</b> (current loop) - an interface designed to transmit information using measured values ‚Äã‚Äãof the strength of an electric current.  The IFSS interface was used to transmit data over long distances (up to several kilometers).  It was widely used in computers manufactured in the USSR and the CMEA countries until the 1990s. <br><br>  Despite the fact that the computer has standardized Centronics and V.24 interfaces, it is not possible to use them without modifying the connecting cables. <br><br>  As you know, the standard LPT port of any IBM compatible computer has a female connector, and the standard (albeit DB25) COM port has a male connector.  At Robotron CM1910, these connectors are made exactly the opposite, and the counterpart of the standard printer or mouse connection cable simply does not fit in there physically. <br><br>  However, after soldering the connectors, we have the opportunity to connect the printer and mouse to the Robotron CM1910 computer. <br><br>  But everything is good and smooth only in theory, but in practice it turned out quite the opposite: <br><br>  <b>1. Mouse</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8bd/b6a/03e/8bdb6a03e100a95ce7b8d88136156c79.jpg" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/15e/681/c09/15e681c09babc4f952eff20136132e64.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Photo source: <a href="http://www.robotrontechnik.de/">http://www.robotrontechnik.de/</a> <br><br>  The mouse for the Robotron CM1910 computer is needed not with the usual DB9 ‚ÄúFemale‚Äù, but with a 25-pin connector.  Yes, and the "Male".  There was only a common rodent from the company Genius, but this, in principle, is not fatal. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/27f/417/9ad/27f4179adb6ca8edfc24618bcf3f1f0a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  We take the old cable from the printer, unsolder the necessary connector, look at the specification of the signals and make our mouse a new tail.  We download the driver under DOS, we connect the mouse, we start <b>gmouse.exe</b> and ... did not take off. <br><br>  The question arose, do Com ports work at all?  This is easy to check with the <b>CheckIt</b> diagnostic <b>program</b> and such a simple test stub: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/350/c24/781/350c247815876d36d24e0df63c81ab1a.png" alt="image"><br><br>  We solder, run the program and ... test failed both ports V.24. <br><br>  It should be noted that in this case it is impossible to speak with certainty about the physical failure of serial interfaces.  It is possible that I just have crooked hands.  Or the Robotron CM1910 computer‚Äôs incomplete compatibility with the usual IBM PC is to blame - the port addresses and interruptions may differ from the standard ones, and the CheckIt program should not be trusted (especially since it did not correctly identify the drives).  However, I could not confirm or deny this theory, since the <a href="http://www.tiffe.de/Robotron/">available documentation</a> for this computer was written in German.  I speak this language at the level of the Soviet partisan from the provinces, and I didn‚Äôt want to do OCR in order to feed the text to the google translate because of the lack of free time. <br><br>  <b>2. Printer</b> <br><br>  The situation with the printer is ambiguous.  Theoretically, the Centronics interface is standardized, but it is quite possible that the Robotron CM1910 has a non-standard pinout pinout.  I could not find any information about this in the documentation, so I had to give up the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãscrewing the EPSON LX-100 dot matrix printer to the Robotron CM1910 computer. <br><br>  <i>With the iron part over, proceed to the program.</i> <br><br>  <b>operating system</b> <br><br>  The following operating systems could be installed on the Robotron CM1910 computer: <br><br>  <b>DCP1700</b> is a clone of the MS-DOS 3.2 operating system.  The most common OS on Robotron CM1910. <br>  <b>SCP1700</b> is an operating system compatible with CP / M86. <br>  <b>MUTOS1700</b> is one of the UNIX clones. <br>  <b>BOS1810</b> is a real-time multitasking operating system. <br><br>  When using some programs written under DOS, problems often arose because the Robotron CM1910 was not fully compatible with the IBM PC hardware.  However, after a little refinement of the drivers and connecting a computer mouse, it was possible to even run Microsoft Windows 3.0. <br><br>  Unfortunately, I was not able to find the Karl-Marx-St√§dter Window-System distribution (it was the name of the Microsoft Windows 3.0 version that was modified in the GDR), so I‚Äôll have to be content with the photos produced on the Internet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5ab/8ff/9b5/5ab8ff9b59ab4f255c9e2c4c33109b96.jpg" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7ef/9cc/8ba/7ef9cc8ba721a966f6e4302254ecfa41.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Photo source: <a href="http://www.robotrontechnik.de/">http://www.robotrontechnik.de/</a> <br><br>  One of the first programs that I had to use on the Robotron CM1910 computer, strangely enough, was the MWINCH utility designed to create and format partitions on the HDD. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d39/4e5/e70/d394e5e7062365e2aae3b94d6b2126c7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The fact is that this computer has a MFM Robotron K5504.20 hard drive without the auto-parking function of the magnetic heads.  Before shutting down the computer with such a hard disk, you must execute the parking command (park, hdpark and similar), otherwise you can damage not only the information recorded on the HDD, but also the hard disk itself. <br><br>  Unfortunately, there was nothing on the hard disk similar to the park command, and I had to shut down the computer bypassing the HDD parking procedure, for which I soon had to pay - after the next incorrect shutdown, the operating system stopped loading. <br><br>  Well, I broke it myself, and I will have to repair it myself. <br><br>  To do this, I had to get from the bins of the Motherland a 5.25 "drive and some floppy disks to it. I also needed a Windows 98 computer that could make friends with the drive mentioned. <br><br>  We <a href="http://www.kcclub.de/dlarchiv/09/RUBRIK37.HTM">download the</a> image of the DCP 3.3 <a href="http://www.kcclub.de/dlarchiv/09/RUBRIK37.HTM">bootable diskette</a> , and the <a href="http://old-dos.ru/index.php%3Fpage%3Dfiles%26mode%3Dfiles%26do%3Dshow%26id%3D1474">Teledisk</a> program, with which this image will be restored to a five-inch diskette. <br><br>  Boot from a floppy disk, create partitions using <b>mwinch.exe</b> and format the hard disk using the <b>format c: / s</b> command <b>(we use the / s</b> key to tell the format utility to transfer system files from a floppy disk to a hard disk).  For complete happiness, copy the autoexec.bat and config.sys from the diskette to the root of the C: drive, and the remaining files to some directory (for example, C: \ DCP-DOS). <br><br>  The operating system is installed.  Profit! <br><br>  It remains only to install and run several programs of that time in order to appreciate the huge potential of the 8086 processor. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/dd1/cd1/8ff/dd1cd18ffe83fca600436675d25109fc.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <b>CheckIt</b> will show us what Robotron has under the hood. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4a0/88e/dc6/4a088edc63b1639f585a2c4941a1eb46.jpg" alt="image"><br>  RAR Archiver <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bd0/1ee/57d/bd01ee57daee18befc0a66296863626a.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The same Tetris <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/464/ff1/362/464ff136271420bc477d042cbe9a39f5.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Trubo Pascacal 5.5 <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d12/954/842/d12954842d23b3299a12fac8ff181933.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Volkov commander <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5ff/b6d/fc3/5ffb6dfc357a8bceabc8ecfa9407a994.jpg" alt="image"><br>  And of course, do not forget about the park! <br><br>  And for those who do not have enough photos of the computer Robotron CM 1910, the video is stored in a disgusting quality. <br><br><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://video.yandex.ru/iframe/melamori-ru/op79a5k84i.2122/&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhizfgN-tkorn9TPVa5AucITmSNx9g" width="419" height="315" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="1"></iframe></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/162043/">https://habr.com/ru/post/162043/</a></p>
