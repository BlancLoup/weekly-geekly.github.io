  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Big cotton</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Thousands of years ago, Man picked up a bone.  A man painted on the sand bison.  This drawing takes up about 140 gigabytes of hard drive manufactured in China.  140 is a huge amount of data that includes images, fears and happiness that are useful for the process.  The sand keeps in itself only grooves that mean nothing without a Man and his fellow tribesmen watching him. <br>  The man picked up a computer mouse.  The man clicked on the "Like" button.  Guided by his three-dimensional I, the man correlated this piece of information with himself and put it in the bottomless piggy bank of his two-dimensional I. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Bone and mouse are creative tools.  Sand and hard disk are different.  The first stores information for several days and does not work without a person.  The second, being a 100% synthetic memory substitute, does not need a person.  Images are full and live on hard drives independently and without a process of observation are complete.  If emotions are interpreted as specific data sequences, then network-connected hard drives can provide such sequences regardless of the presence or absence of an observer. <br><br>  With the advent of social networks, a person realized that the need to store certain types of information is mobile, in his head, gradually disappears.  This is a natural process of evolution and the desire for simplification.  The Internet is a dimensionless repository and people understand this perfectly well.  The absence of the concept of constraints forces us to approach the process of processing and understanding information in times reckless.  Increasingly, a person is engaged not in the synthesis and operational actions with information, but in direct selectionism.  By checking for conformity to your three-dimensional self, lost in the process. Every day, hundreds of millions of people put information into their two-dimensional I boxes.  The observer in this situation does not look at the Man who is afraid, who has got the bone, has got the fire, and sometimes, an absolutely different two-dimensional creation.  A creation that is huge.  All the features of his hypertrophied.  A person got the opportunity with the help of "Bone" to create another absolutely living being.  Create I two-dimensional.  Imaginary prismatic creation, the size of a keyhole, that's what a man wants to get three-dimensional.  So that everyone looks and spies on him, creating from the observer‚Äôs point of view an incredible picture that is most attractive. <br><br>  This process is not reversible.  We look to him directly into the luminous face, symbolizing for us happiness and abundance.  The need for three-dimensional I disappears.  The third dimension of Man begins to collapse.  The task and purpose of the existence of a two-dimensional person consists only in the accumulation of information and the dissemination of knowledge about its volume and availability.  Thus, the creative process comes to naught.  After it ends, the person finally moves from a state of three dimensions to a state of two.  Since distance and time are not important for a new person, he will immediately begin his Last March.  March to singularity.  To the Sand without a Man and an Observer. </div>
