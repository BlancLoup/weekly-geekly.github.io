Jill Tarter, ex-leader and co-founder of <a href="http://www.seti.org/">SETI</a> (now the leading scientist of the project) believes that if aliens visit Earth, they will control us through the use of their advanced technologies.  Their technology will allow them to set their own rules.

      Tarter argues that the appearance of aliens on our "threshold" will already mean that in terms of technology, they are much more advanced than humans.  However, they do not necessarily have to be aggressive - if civilization has learned to overcome great distances in the Universe, this civilization probably learned to be peaceful. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/170/ff7/ff4/170ff7ff4e45075f956f5890fc233447.jpg"><br><br>  This may mean that the aliens will be relatively friendly and will cooperate with the Earth (here it is worth remembering the ‚Äú <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA_%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BE%25D1%2587%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5">Roadside Picnic</a> ‚Äù by the Strugatskys, where it was said that the alien mind will not pay attention to earthlings at all, as we do not pay attention to ants on place for a picnic). <br><br>  At SETI, attempts are now continuing to detect signals from alien civilizations.  There is still no success. <br><br>  Natalie Cabrol (Nathalie Cabrol), a leading scientific expert at the Seti Institute in California, believes that the alien mind can and is trying to communicate with the Earth, but we are not yet able to detect signals.  At the same time, cosmonaut John Gransfeld (John Grunsfeld), now occupying the post of head of NASA research programs (associate administrator for NASA's Science Mission Directorate), assumes that aliens are already aware of the existence of humanity, and are watching us.  He claims that the technologically advanced alien civilization is able to detect a planetary civilization based on an analysis of the changes that this civilization has made on and around the planet.  ‚ÄúWe have changed our atmosphere so much that any observer with a powerful telescope who is 20 light-years away from us can detect us,‚Äù says Gransfeld. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/07e/d38/ba1/07ed38ba1d5b32615061a3d1606f794d.jpg"><br>  <i>John Gransfeld (photo: Wikipedia)</i> <br><br>  According to Karbol, we will be able to detect alien organisms (the simplest life) outside the Earth already during our life.  She also believes that we can find a copy of the Earth in another galaxy, for example. <br><br>  With the scientists agree NASA supervisor Ellen Stofan (Ellen Stofan).  According to her, for 20-30 years we will be able to find evidence of the existence of extraterrestrial life.  ‚ÄúWe know where to look, we know how to search, and in most cases we have the necessary technology,‚Äù says Ellen.  She adds that this is not about green men, but about microbes. <br><br>  Supporters of the imminent discovery of extraterrestrial life have an opposition.  So, a group of astrobiologists from the Australian National University believes that if life arises on other planets, then its existence is very transient.  When microbial life occurs, scientists say, conditions that are unfavorable to life arise very quickly - for example, the planet cools or overheats.  As a result, life is dying.  However, this group of scientists believes that in the Universe there are many planets suitable for life. <br><br>  And in order to exist for a long time, experts say, life forms must learn to manage greenhouse gases in order to keep the temperature regime of the planet stable.  Thus, life forms themselves are responsible for their survival.  And it's not a reasonable life.  For example, on Earth, early life forms began to affect the content of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, and eventually they began to produce oxygen in sufficient quantity for the emergence of life forms. <br><br>  But not always this situation is repeated on other planets. <br><br>  Who is right - it is unclear, we will only know this with time. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/390073/">https://habr.com/ru/post/390073/</a></p>
