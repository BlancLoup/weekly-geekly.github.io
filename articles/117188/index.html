This advice comes from <a href="http://danzarrella.com/">Dan</a> Zarrella ( <a href="http://danzarrella.com/">Dan Zarrella</a> ), a social media researcher who has <a href="https://twitter.com/danzarrella">33,000 followers</a> .  Zarrell works for <a href="http://www.hubspot.com/">HubSpot</a> , where she processes data on hundreds of millions of tweets, blog posts, and mailings.  This data is used by marketers, it is worth paying attention to them and newsmen. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Zarrell claims that the correct strategy for Twitter posts depends in part on your goals.  Want to collect as many followers?  Then tweet often.  Twitter users from list A, that is, those who have the largest number of followers, tweet on average 22 times a day, so that in general it can be argued that the more tweets, the more followers.  <b>If your goal is to bring traffic to your site, you need to limit your passion.</b>  For those who post two or more links per hour, the number of clicks on these links is significantly less than those who post no more than one link per hour. <br><br>  This is not an exact science, but at least some attempt to subordinate behavior in social media to algebra, where most of the actions are based on intuition.  (Zarrell complains about well-known advice like ‚Äúlove your audience, support followers, participate in discussions.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt sounds good, it's hard not to agree with that,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúHowever, these tips are not supported by observational data.‚Äù)

      Zarrell shared the results of data analysis, which he collected for two years, at <a href="http://www.hubspot.com/the-science-of-timing/">the Science of Timeliness webinar</a> .  This science is rather not about "when", but about "when it is better not."  The author himself calls it "anti-competitive planning" (contra-competitive timing).  <b>Its meaning is to send a signal to its audience at a time when the noise of the crowd is as quiet as possible.</b> <br><br>  It turns out that this moment is in the afternoon, when the activity of blogs and news sites falls, and on weekends.  The latter are favorable for posts at any time when people are not sleeping. <br><br>  Zarrell discovered that the peak of retweets was at the end of the working day - from 14.00 to 17.00.  Want to get the most out of your life?  The ideal time for your post - 16.00.  Especially good if it's the end of the week.  Especially for Twitter Dan created the <a href="http://tweetwhen.com/">TweetWhen service</a> , where they can get relevant recommendations on the topic.  (Our own tweet - <a href="http://twitter.com/niemanlab">@niemanlab</a> - the largest number of retweets gets around nine in the evening and on Saturday, <a href="http://tweetwhen.com/%3Fname%3Dniemanlab">go see for yourself</a> .) <br><br>  In the mornings of weekends, when the number of page views drops sharply on news sites, the number of clicks on Twitter links soars.  The same thing happens with comments.  Users simply have more time to view the content, even if it is not so fresh anymore.  Yes, and things do not interfere with reading.  On Facebook, this effect is even better.  Compared with the weekend, the activity of users on weekdays is infinitely small.  (Den assumes that many people have access to Facebook simply denied work.) And just like Twitter, Facebook doesn‚Äôt like frequent posting.  It‚Äôs easier to beat the fans than on Twitter.  Posts on Facebook are more ‚Äútenacious‚Äù, which makes the reaction of people to them more long-playing. <br><br>  In addition, Zarrell recommends <b>tweeting not only more, but also repeating the same link two or three times</b> a day.  No need to apologize for repeating to those who have already seen it.  Just wait a couple of hours and post it with a different text.  Only a small fraction of your followers will experience deja vu.  Even thousands of people in most cases lack their entire audience from the first time.  (For the experiment, <a href="http://twitter.com/GUYKAWASAKI">Guy Kawasaki</a> once <a href="http://www.openforum.com/idea-hub/topics/the-world/article/how-to-drive-traffic-with-repeat-tweets-guy-kawasaki">posted the same link every day for nine days</a> . It <a href="http://www.openforum.com/idea-hub/topics/the-world/article/how-to-drive-traffic-with-repeat-tweets-guy-kawasaki">turned</a> out that the number of clicks on it remained high every day.) <br><br>  Zarrell made a similar deep measurement in the mailings, having <a href="http://blog.mailchimp.com/subscriber-engagement-half-life/">analyzed 9.5 billion letters</a> sent by MailChimp.  Most of the findings confirmed here.  Send letters more often and pay attention to the weekend. <br><br>  Most of those who unsubscribe from mailings, do it after the first letter.  It turned out that, at least 30 letters were sent a month, or only 5, no difference.  (‚ÄúThose who unsubscribe do you a favor,‚Äù says Dan. ‚ÄúThey don't want to listen to you anyway.‚Äù) The most important point to hook the subscriber is the first two days after he subscribed.  Four months later, the average subscriber‚Äôs click-through rate drops to almost zero.  In the same way as in blogs and social media, the reader is most likely to read the letter and follow links on the weekend.  On any day of the week, the best result is from 4 to 7 in the morning. <br><br>  Slides from the webinar can be viewed <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/HubSpot/the-science-of-timing">here</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/117188/">https://habr.com/ru/post/117188/</a></p>
