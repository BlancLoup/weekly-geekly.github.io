All news sites are full of headlines " <a href="http://chto-proishodit.ru/articles/2016/09/25/123100055424">NASA discovered a new sign of the zodiac</a> ."  ‚ÄúThe horoscope is outdated,‚Äù ‚Äú <a href="https://www.bfm.ru/news/334047">NASA changed the dates of the signs of the Zodiac,</a> ‚Äù and so on and so forth ... However, what is the scientific nature of this discovery, and what does NASA have to do with it? <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6df/696/d29/6df696d2931c409f89d69b0b2283b632.png"><br><br>  And how to find out yourself, under what sign were you born?  Let's figure it out. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In order not to get confused, let's turn to the light of knowledge - Wikipedia: <br><blockquote>  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2597%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8_%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0">The signs of the zodiac</a> are 12 sectors of 30 ¬∞ each, in which the zodiacal belt is divided into astrology, each of these areas is assigned certain metaphysical properties that play a role in the analysis of horoscopes. </blockquote><br>  It is believed that a person was born under a certain sign, if at the time of his birth the Sun was in the appropriate constellation. <br><br>  The system of signs of the zodiac originated in ancient Babylon.  The constellation was then considered a figure formed by the stars.  Since then, the constellations have changed, and the Earth's orbit, and the position of the Sun in the universe.  And most importantly, the definition of "constellation".

    <blockquote>  Currently, the borders of the constellations, defined by the decision of the I General Assembly of the International Astronomical Union in 1922 (spherical, often irregularly shaped, polygons with borders running parallel to the latitudes and longitudes of the equatorial coordinate system), are officially used. </blockquote><br>  If you take a sky map, for example, this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8dc/9b1/205/8dc9b12051fa47d3bd2791139ca724d6.gif"><br>  <em>Here in full size</em> <br><br>  We can see the Ecliptic.  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25AD%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BF%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0">The ecliptic</a> is a large circle of the celestial sphere, along which the apparent annual movement of the sun occurs.  Accordingly, the ecliptic plane is the plane of rotation of the Earth around the Sun. <br><br>  I circled it red on the map: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8ec/02b/9ff/8ec02b9ff5684cae9d9dde18ceb5d15e.gif"><br><br>  It is easy to see that the size of the constellations, and most importantly their length along the ecliptic, is very different, and is not at all like 1/12 of a circle. <br><br>  Here, for example, Capricorn: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f02/a7c/4d7/f02a7c4d7c984840938f3aefdde32dbc.gif"><br><br>  Draw a line from the center of the map through the Ecliptic intersection point with the Capricorn border: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/732/e88/368/732e883680f546e1ae897ef92ea8753a.gif"><br><br>  Now through the second: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d81/fbf/2f4/d81fbf2f445e4f25a70b26f01038610f.gif"><br><br>  The dates that are between these lines (Jan. 22 ‚Äî Feb. 19) are the real dates of the zodiacal calendar. <br><br>  Armed with a ruler, draw lines from the center of the map through the points of intersection of the boundaries of the constellations with Ecliptic.  Dates around the map, cut off by the rays and will be the desired Zodiacal calendar. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7ec/825/5dd/7ec8255ddc104bfb99e48217c948efac.gif"></a> <br><br>  And here it is, the final table.  As you can see, it does not partially coincide with the ‚ÄúNASA revelations‚Äù presented on the Internet. But you can count and decide who is right.  Moreover, the data for the NASA table are not taken from the source <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/19c/492/abb/19c492abb8ed44238d9e6647397a4176.gif"><br><br>  So, the essence we found out.  It remains only to find out why all of a sudden journalists got mad just now?  After all, these changes have accumulated over thousands of years.  And already a hundred years ago, that was exactly how the sky map looked.  In my closet is a plate with the same calculation, made by hand, which is already fifty years old.  In addition, ten years ago I saw the publication of "British scientists" about zodiac signs of similar content.  As well as a number of other articles at different times.  <a href="http://www.gorobzor.ru/articles/chelovek-v-gorode/trinadcatyy-znak-zodiaka-07-05-2009">For example</a> .  Well, in general, any person who picked up a map of the starry sky, without any problems, will determine the number of signs and the dates of the passage of the Sun through the constellation. <br><br>  But that's not the point.  This is astronomy.  And Astrology is in charge of Zodiac Signs.  And NASA expressed in the spirit of "You misunderstand us, we do not do astrology." <br><br>  And astrologers gave an even more epic phrase that ‚Äúthey don't care how the Earth and the Sun move there, and what constellations it passes through‚Äù.  They have a CALENDAR.  Unshakable, composed by the ancients and the wise ... <br><br>  Only now, when astrologers predict fate, for some reason they refer to the influence of stars, constellations, the Sun and planets.  But take into account the real position of the stars - and why?  <s>Fuckers</s> people pay money anyway. <br><br>  PS Article about ASTRONOMY.  And about the fact that astrology, as everyone knows, is pseudoscientific bullshit. <br>  The article is written so that people know what the signs of the zodiac are and how they depend on the Ecliptic.  In order not to be on the "sensation" from NASA about astrology.  And then maybe NASA will discover that the Earth revolves around the sun.  Now it is already in doubt for many. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/397805/">https://habr.com/ru/post/397805/</a></p>
