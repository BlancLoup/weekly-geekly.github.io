  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Grand Battery Testing</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Every time I bought batteries, I had many questions: <br><br>  How expensive are the batteries better than the cheap ones? <br>  How much is the capacity of lithium batteries more than usual? <br>  How much capacity of salt batteries is less than that of alkaline ones? <br>  Are batteries for digital devices different from normal? <br>  Which of the same-priced batteries is better to buy? <br><br>  To get answers to these questions, I decided to test all AA and AAA batteries that can be found in Moscow.  I collected 58 types of AA batteries and 35 types of AAA.  A total of 255 batteries were tested - 170 AA and 85 AAA.

He aroused great interest, it was viewed more than 150,000 times in LiveJournal and dragged off all over the Internet.  After that, <a href="http://olegart.ru/">Oleg Artamonov</a> gave me his <a href="http://ammo1.livejournal.com/470053.html">battery analyzer</a> and I decided to do a global test. <br><br>  To improve measurement accuracy, the battery analyzer does not use PWM - it creates a constant resistive load on the battery.  The device can operate in different modes.  For testing AA batteries, three main modes were used: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Discharge DC 200 mA.  Such a load is peculiar to electronic toys; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Discharge pulse 1000 mA (10 seconds load, 10 seconds pause).  Such a load is peculiar to digital devices; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Discharge pulse 2500 mA (10 seconds load, 20 seconds pause).  Such a load is characteristic of powerful digital devices - cameras, flashes. <br><br>  In addition, four batteries each were discharged with small currents of 50 and 100 mA. <br><br>  Measurements were made when the batteries were discharged to a voltage of 0.7 V. <br><br>  All test data is summarized in the table: <a href="http://nadezhin.ru/lj/ljfiles/bat_ammo1.xls">nadezhin.ru/lj/ljfiles/bat_ammo1.xls</a> <br><br>  The discharge graph clearly shows how different types of batteries behave. <br><br>  Discharge AA batteries with a current of 200 mA: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/74b/817/4ec/74b8174ec1c50042498de0ba0890fa85.jpg"><br><br>  The first five lines are saline batteries.  It is clearly seen how much less their capacity. <br>  The last three lines are lithium batteries.  They not only have a large capacity, but also discharge in another way: the voltage on them does not decrease almost to the very end, and then drops sharply.  This is especially pronounced in the GP Lithium battery.  In addition, lithium batteries can work in the cold. <br>  Among the many similar alkaline batteries, two outsiders are clearly visible - Sony Platinum and Panasonic Alkaline and two leaders - Duracell Turbo Max and Ansmann X-Power.  The remaining batteries differ in capacity by only 15%. <br><br>  You can study each battery on the interactive discharge graph: <a href="http://nadezhin.ru/lj/ljfiles/aa200.html">nadezhin.ru/lj/ljfiles/aa200.html</a> .  If you hover the mouse on any point of the graph, the name of the battery will be displayed.  If you click on a point, the discharge curve of this battery is highlighted.  You can also click on the battery names below.  For interactive graphics, many thanks to Alexey Tyaglov.  Unfortunately, the discharge time is incorrectly displayed on interactive graphics.  In fact, it is four times smaller. <br><br>  In the first diagram, AA batteries are sorted by capacity at a discharge current of 200 mA. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7c2/d54/962/7c2d54962a69efe578a57eca3a1e7945.jpg"><br><br>  Duracell Turbo Max batteries do have a capacity that is slightly larger than all other alkaline batteries, but I came across one pack of Duracell Turbo Max, which were significantly worse than the others.  In terms of capacity, they corresponded to the usual cheap batteries.  In the table and on the graphs, they are labeled "Duracell Turbo Max BAD".  A post about these batteries: <a href="http://ammo1.livejournal.com/548534.html">ammo1.livejournal.com/548534.html</a> . <br><br>  It is clearly seen from the diagram that different batteries manifest themselves differently when discharged by high and low currents.  For example, Camelion Plus Alkaline gives more energy than Camelion Digi Alkaline on a small current.  And on the big all the way around.  As a rule, on batteries designed for large currents indicate that they are designed for digital devices.  In this case, there are many universal batteries that work perfectly with any currents. <br><br>  I averaged the amount of energy that batteries give out at high and low currents and based on the results and price of batteries (which in some cases is only approximate), I made a chart of the cost of one watt-hour for all AA batteries. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/036/d28/0d8/036d280d8ecb4107e0a6b7aa00662b1b.jpg"><br><br>  All types of AAA batteries were discharged with a direct current of 200 mA.  Some types of AAA batteries were subjected to a second test ‚Äî a discharge of 1000 mA in the ‚Äúconstant resistance‚Äù mode (the current decreased with the discharge).  This mode emulates the operation of batteries in the lamp. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bf2/8ed/c7b/bf28edc7b8d46e4ef278b035245b988a.jpg"><br><br>  In AAA format, Duracell Turbo Max turned out to be far from the best alkaline battery.  Many cheap batteries (for example Ikea, Navigator, aro, FlexPower) had a larger capacity. <br><br>  Interactive graph of the discharge of AAA batteries: <a href="http://nadezhin.ru/lj/ljfiles/aaa200.html">nadezhin.ru/lj/ljfiles/aaa200.html</a> . <br><br>  <i>Technical findings:</i> <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Most alkaline batteries differ in capacity by only 15%; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Lithium batteries have 1.5-3 times (depending on load current) greater capacity than alkaline ones; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Unlike alkaline, the voltage on lithium batteries almost does not decrease in the process of discharge; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Saline batteries are 3.5 times worse than alkaline at low currents and can not work at all at high; <br>  ‚Ä¢ There are three types of alkaline batteries: universal, designed for low load currents and designed for high load currents.  In this case, universal is better than the other two at all currents. <br><br>  <i>Consumer findings:</i> <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Salt batteries buy inappropriate.  Even in devices with the lowest consumption, alkaline (Alkaline) will last much longer due to its long shelf life; <br>  ‚Ä¢ It is most profitable to buy batteries sold under Auchan and Ikea brands; <br>  ‚Ä¢ In other stores you can safely buy the cheapest alkaline batteries; <br>  ‚Ä¢ From what is sold in grocery stores, the best choice is GP Super; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Lithium batteries are expensive, but they are lightweight, capacious and can work in the cold. <br><br>  Most of the batteries were provided by the wholesalers <a href="http://www.istochnik.ru/">Source Battaris</a> , and <a href="http://www.istochnik.ru/">Grid</a> <a href="http://e-s-t.ru/">and Technology</a> .  <a href="http://ikea.ru/">Ikea</a> , Camelion, Navigator provided their batteries.  I bought some batteries in Auchan, Metro, Okay, Yulmart, Pyaterochka, Dixie stores. <br><br>  This article has been written for almost a year, so all prices are as of the summer of 2014. <br><br>  My articles about batteries: <br><br>  <a href="http://ammo1.livejournal.com/564015.html">"Chemistry" of batteries</a> <br>  <a href="http://ammo1.livejournal.com/559971.html">Batteries and frost</a> <br>  <a href="http://ammo1.livejournal.com/566368.html">AA and AAA batteries capacity</a> <br><br>  ps I remind you that batteries can not be thrown into ordinary garbage.  You can find out where to take the batteries here: <a href="http://yopolis.ru/l/batareyka">yopolis.ru/l/batareyka</a> . <br><br>  ¬© 2014, Alexey Nadyozhin. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/364773/">https://habr.com/ru/post/364773/</a></p>
