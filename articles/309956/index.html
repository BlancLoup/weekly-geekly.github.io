The body type of each type includes the main features of a certain type, which distinguish it from the others.  The physique will also help determine our dominant type and more.  You can not only rely on information about the physique, but by starting to work with a certain person, you can more easily recognize his personality type.

    <h2>  <font color="#0071c5">1. The spiritual type</font> </h2><br>  A year ago, I had a friend, Irvine, a vivid example of a classical spiritual type.  He seemed to be in another world, his thoughts were in the clouds.  In fact, when I passed him, waved his hand to him and said, ‚ÄúHello, Irwin!‚Äù, Only then did he greet me in reply. <br><br>  Most of the energy of the spiritual type is concentrated in their head, and therefore it seems that they are "not of this world."  As a rule, they are thin, somewhat stunted and may look disheveled.  For example, Paul Allen and actor Jim Carrey are great examples of this type.  <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/7-sovetov-pomogayushchikh-izbavitsya-ot-sotsiofobii/">Interacting with people</a> and being in society can be scary for them. <br><br>  In business, when interacting with representatives of this type, it is important not to seem aggressive.  This may scare them.  It is best to be more gentle - try to be "on the same wavelength with them."  Such people remarkably support intellectual and non-aggressive conversations.  Those who have the features of the spiritual type, become excellent programmers, accountants, and representatives of other professions that require minimal communication with customers and frequent privacy at your desk. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">2. Love type</font> </h2><br>  Representatives of this type love to communicate with people, they are very sensual and thoughtful.  Woody Allen and Nicolas Cage are the brightest representatives of this type.  They <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/obzor-seminara-toni-robbinsa-osvobodite-vnutrennyuyu-silu-den-3-idite-naprolom-k-svoey-novoy-zhizni-/">draw energy</a> from communication with other people, and seem to be drawn to others in order to transfer their energy to them.  Unfortunately, people may find that the representatives of the amorous type stick to them, and with them are uncomfortable, and then try to push away such "comrades". <br><br>  In a business environment, it is important to be understanding and kind with such people, but not to try to persistently fill their emotional void with your attention and support.  Representatives of this type speak a lot and often in a melodious voice.  It will be difficult to complete a telephone conversation with them or get them <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/5-sposobov-ostavatsya-sosredotochennym-v-mire-polnom-otvlekayushchikh-faktorov/">to do</a> their <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/5-sposobov-ostavatsya-sosredotochennym-v-mire-polnom-otvlekayushchikh-faktorov/">daily business</a> .  The art of communicating with these people is not in their rudeness to alienate them, but in order to get them to concentrate on the right occupation. <br><br>  This type will do an excellent job with customer service.  They will also assist employees with personal issues, conflicts or complaints.  They are suitable professions that require interaction with people on an emotional level. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">3. Sensual type</font> </h2><br>  Representatives of sensual type, as a rule, are overweight and squat figures.  John Candy and Oliver Hardy are great examples.  These people have a big and loving heart, they are trying to please others.  If you load the cart, they will carry it.  They will even download it for you.  For example, they will offer to help you cope with excessive workload, even if you yourself are busy with things. <br><br>  You can ask them about anything, but you need not to become impudent, demanding too much.  When they realize that they have been downloaded too hard or are offended by you, they will not want to contact you.  Instead, they will hide an insult.  Once their limit is reached, they can lose their peace of mind.  They are very sensitive and helpful, so they are easily offended.  Their kindness helps them to easily interact with people and work with them every day; they are really good people. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">4. Responsible for all type</font> </h2><br>  "I am right, and you are mistaken" - this is the motto of this type.  They often do not believe people, ‚Äúkeep their ears open‚Äù so as not to be betrayed, and therefore try to keep everything under control.  In men of this type, narrow lower body and muscular upper.  With such a physique, they would say, "I am responsible for everything here."  Sylvester Stallone and Hulk Hogan are the brightest representatives of this type.  Women of this type have a pear-shaped figure or a strong chest. <br><br>  Better not to conflict with them.  Even when you realize that these people are wrong, pointing out the erroneousness of their views will most often lead to nothing.  It is better to try to recognize their point of view and work with them in order to develop the idea further.  If, ultimately, the incorrectness of their ideas is confirmed, they admit failure.  In fact, this principle of operation is much simpler, because they always try to <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/6-veshchey-kotorye-naibolee-produktivnye-lyudi-delayut-kazhdyy-den/">be one step ahead</a> .  As soon as they get to the core of the conversation, they will try their best to come to a conclusion faster than the rest. <br><br>  Representatives of this type are excellent sellers and managers, because until the very end they remain true to their views and happy when others accept their point of view.  They are endowed with the gift of thinking globally and perfectly manage the team.  Due to the fact that they are afraid of mistakes, betrayals and sneaky blows, they always see the full picture of what is happening, and this ability is a really valuable quality in business. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">5. Perfectionists</font> </h2><br>  These people seem to be dressed in form even when they wear a canvas bag.  Their proportions are close to perfect.  Representative representatives of this type are John Tash and Nancy Pelosi.  In fact, they can irritate and repel people, because they seem ideal. <br><br>  In fact, they have a kind heart, which they cannot show, but which can break like glass if they are criticized or rejected.  They are trying to constantly find an occupation for themselves or put all their efforts to ensure that there is not a single flaw in their surroundings.  Their workplace and office space are always in perfect order. <br><br>  Perfectionists are great at organizing offices, quality control, research or creating an office system and documentation.  However, they can be so obsessed with striving to make everything, down to the smallest detail, ideal, which makes it hard for them to stop when it is necessary.  If your subordinate is a perfectionist, it is best to give him clear assignments and a deadline for their implementation. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Conclusion</font> </h2><br>  To some extent, each person has all types of personality.  For the first time applying this knowledge in practice, people usually make mistakes in their judgments.  However, in practice it can be noted that in each person there can be two or three main types at the same time.  Once you understand this, your ability to interact with people in the workplace will increase significantly. <br><br>  An exercise would be useful: look at the passers-by or remember your friends and try to determine what type of personality they are.  Having learned to distinguish it, you will be able to communicate more effectively with people not only in the workplace, but also in your personal life. <br><br>  PS We recommend another useful article on the work on yourself - <a href="http://testutor.ru/blog/5-prostyx-sposobov-sformirovat-umenie-ponimat-emocii-drugix-lyudej/">Five simple ways to form the ability to understand the emotions of others</a> . <br><br>  The author of the translation is Vyacheslav Davidenko, the founder of the <a href="http://testutor.ru/">TESTutor</a> company. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/309956/">https://habr.com/ru/post/309956/</a></p>
