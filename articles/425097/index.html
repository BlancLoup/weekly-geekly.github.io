  <section class="page js-page"><h1>"The law of Spring" was supposed to earn from October 1, but the operators do not have enough documentation</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/381/2d6/038/3812d60381ec08c85f0fcf65ee22b916.jpg" align="left" width="300">  From October 1, the anti-terrorism amendments of State Duma deputy Irina Yarovaya and a member of the Federation Council, Viktor Ozerov, were supposed to start working in full force.  Namely - operators from the beginning of the month should start the procedure of storing the Internet traffic of subscribers.  This is <a href="https://www.vedomosti.ru/technology/articles/2018/10/01/782493-zakon-yarovoi">reported</a> by Vedomosti.  According to the government‚Äôs decision, every year, for five years, operators must increase the capacity of Internet traffic storage by 15%.  In addition, the information can be stored on the servers of other operators - however, in this case, everything must be coordinated with the FSB. <br><br>  The government previously explained that operators are obliged to store data for 30 days from the day the storage system was put into operation.  And it is precisely here that the snag is that the delivery of data storage systems, especially personal information, is not a quick procedure.  Therefore, operators simply can not immediately begin to store data, as it is written in the "Law of Spring". <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The problem is that the coordination should be carried out according to a specific procedure, according to the regulatory documents.  And just the documents that regulate the characteristics of the equipment, the certification process and installation are currently missing.  The Ministry of Communications and the Federal Security Service has not yet developed clear requirements for equipment for the removal and storage of data.  If these documents appear, for example, tomorrow, the implementation procedure will still be delayed until the end of 2019. <br><br>  Currently, Rostelecom is considering the issue of storing negotiations and messages of subscribers of T2 RTK Holding, as reported by the company‚Äôs management in August.  The study of the issue has been going on for two months already, and so far the decision has not been made.  Rostelecom is testing various data storage equipment; in addition, the company designs data storage systems, organizes additional channel capacities for transmitting traffic, and performs other necessary steps.

      As for MegaFon, this telecom operator is testing a project in Nizhny Novgorod for the implementation of a data collection, storage and processing complex.  All this is developed on the basis of the hardware solution of the National Technologies company.  The operator already purchases and installs the necessary equipment, as stated by the representative of "Megaphone" Alexander Boreyko. <br><br>  Earlier, Megafon estimated the cost of implementing the Law of Spring at 40 billion rubles over five years, VimpelCom - at 45 billion. This year, VimpelCom will spend about 6 billion rubles to implement the provisions of the ‚ÄúLaw of Spring‚Äù, 7 Billion MTS estimated its costs at 60 billion rubles over five years; its spending plans for this year are unknown. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/425097/">https://habr.com/ru/post/425097/</a></p>
