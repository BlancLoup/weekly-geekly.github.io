The main task is to normalize the biochemistry of the body and preserve the right balance between acid and alkaline products.  In fact, an excess of acid in the tissues of the body leads to many health problems, from lethargy and weakness to obesity and, as a result, more serious complications and diseases.

      <br>
      As our body must maintain a certain temperature, so our blood must maintain a constant pH level.  The pH measurement scale (a measure of the concentration of hydrogen ions) has 15 divisions, where 0 is pure acid and 14 is high alkalinity.  Neutral environment corresponds to 7. Since each tissue of the body requires its own pH level, our blood is forced to maintain this figure at the level of 7.365.  A weak deviation from this figure in any direction will lead to death, and therefore our body will do everything to ensure this balance.  He even borrows minerals from bones and connective tissue to stabilize the pH and neutralize acids. <br><br>  That is why an important task is to eat foods that alkalize your body, for example, raw green foods.  Alkaline components (including liquids that we drink) should be at least 70% of our diet.  One little tip for alkalizing water: add lemon to it. <br><br>  Also I recommend Dr. Robert Young's book ‚ÄúThe pH Miracle‚Äù (‚ÄúThe pH Miracle‚Äù <sup><a href="https://www.amazon.com/pH-Miracle-Balance-Reclaim-Health/dp/0446556181">‚òÖ</a></sup> ). <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">Gift 5: The Benefits of Aerobic Energy</font> </h3><br>  Most people are sure that if you are ‚Äúfit,‚Äù then you are healthy, and this is fundamentally wrong.  There are many people who are in excellent shape and have a gorgeous body, but they are terribly unhealthy.  What is the difference between fitness and health? <br><br>  <b>Physical fitness is the physical ability to exercise athletic activity.</b> <br><br>  <b>Health</b> is a condition in which all body systems - nervous, musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, digestive, lymphatic, hormonal, and others - work optimally. <br><br>  The goal is to be healthy, not just in good shape.  I definitely sin by putting physical fitness above health, because I participate in fitness competitions.  Being engaged as intensely as I do is not very helpful.  On the contrary, it is important to prioritize health and do certain things to harmonize the body. <br><br>  The study showed that if you systematically perform the exercises for 12 months, then this turns into a <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/kak-prevratit-samosovershenstvovanie-v-privychku/">good habit</a> for the rest of your life. <br><br>  The term "aerobic" means "with oxygen" and indicates what level of exercise you want to maintain for a certain time.  Performing aerobic exercises, you give your body more oxygen, which positively affects the heart, lungs, blood vessels, endurance and aerobic muscles.  Also, you stimulate the metabolism of fat burning, to which all and aspire. <br><br>  Read more about this in the fantastic book Slow Burn <sup><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Slow-Burn-Faster-Exercising-Slower/dp/0062736744">‚òÖ</a></sup> written by Stew Mittleman, read by me several years ago, based on the experience of a man who ran 1,600 km in 11 days.  Tony Robbins watched Stew Mittleman to find out how he did it (and how he got so much energy).  Highly recommend this book! <br><br>  The term "anaerobic" means "without oxygen" and refers to exercises that give a short release of power, such as a sprint or weightlifting.  Anaerobic exercise burns glycogen and carbohydrates, while forcing the body to accumulate fat. <br><br>  Often, after a sprint or pushing a barbell, you experience FATIGUE throughout the day.  The fact is that such a load creates acid in your body, and it is forced to expend energy to neutralize it.  On the contrary, if you are jogging or walking at an aerobic pace, then you consume more oxygen and provide yourself with BIG AMOUNT of energy for the whole day. <br><br>  Personally, I use both approaches.  Right now, I am training mainly in an anaerobic mode, which helps me to "shape" the body that I need, and I like it.  But at the same time, I do aerobic exercises that give energy and allow you to achieve goals related to health.  I'm sure you need to keep a balance.  If you are going to engage in anaerobic style, you should definitely neutralize the acid formed in your body. <br><br>  To determine which group - aerobic or anaerobic - is one or another exercise, you can, focusing on the intensity of the load - the heart rate.  The general rule is this: if during classes you are able to maintain a dialogue, then this is aerobics.  And if you do not have such an opportunity, and you do not have enough air, then we are talking about anaerobic training.  Personally, I use the heart rate sensor during my runs to monitor the load and to be sure: I am at the optimum pace. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">Dar 6: The Benefits of Maximum Saturation</font> </h3><br>  It is important to be sure that you use the products, guided by the right considerations.  Although the majority enjoy food, succumbing to the herd instinct, or for the sake of ‚Äúgetting pleasure‚Äù, this is not the purpose of nutrition, but following this philosophy can harm our body. <br><br>  The main purpose of nutrition is to charge the body with energy, promote its growth and development, cleanse and unload the body, prevent diseases and fight them, take care of our external beauty and only THEN socialize us and give pleasure.  Unfortunately, most people do the opposite. <br>  Here are 7 components of the products: <br><ul><li>  carbohydrates; </li><li>  squirrels; </li><li>  fats; </li><li>  vitamins; </li><li>  minerals; </li><li>  water; </li><li>  cellulose. </li></ul><br>  I will not talk about all the functions of these substances, but in order to maintain optimal well-being, it is important to nourish and maintain your body with the right products. <br><br>  During the seminar ‚ÄúFree your inner strength,‚Äù Joseph McClendon III taught us 7 rules for healthy eating.  Here they are. <br><br>  <b>1. Drink water before and after meals, not during.</b>  Drink water 30 minutes before meals and ideally 30 minutes after the meal.  Absorption of water or fluids during the meal dilutes the gastric juices and stops digestion. <br>  <b>2. Combine products correctly.</b>  The wrong combination prevents our body from properly assimilating food and can interfere with the qualitative splitting of foods into nutrients. <br>  <b>3. Eat in a relaxed state.</b>  Be sure to chew food slowly and do not get distracted. <br>  <b>4. Eat the right amount of food.</b> <br>  <b>5. Eat organic foods.</b> <br>  <b>6. Eat small meals every 3 hours.</b>  Aim for 5-6 meals per day. <br>  <b>7. If necessary, include in your diet supplements.</b> <br><br>  There are certain supplements that can be an important addition to your diet, such as seasoning, digestive enzymes, probiotics, oils, acidophilus, antioxidants, multivitamins and minerals. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">Gift 7: The benefits of constructive leveling and maximum endurance</font> </h3><br><br>  The human body was created to move, but few of us use the full potential of it.  Constructive alignment and maximum endurance are designed to take care of the locomotor system subordinate to movement, affecting our balance, metabolism, visual acuity, ability to reproduce and many other fundamental biological processes. <br><br>  It is important to make sure that your body is properly adjusted using stretching, yoga, manual therapy and even exercise complexes. <br><br>  Tony Robbins follows Pete Egosky's method of constructive leveling, which is worth seeing, especially if you are worried about back pain.  I recommend the book ‚ÄúPain Free‚Äù by Pete Egoskyu. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">Gift 8: The benefits of a controlled mind and heart</font> </h3><br>  Your <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/povalnyy-gnev-pochemu-my-naslazhdaemsya-gnevom/">emotional state</a> and emotional well-being also plays a huge role in your physical health and energy.  Negative emotions, thoughts, and beliefs produce acid in your body and can trigger illness or illness.  On the contrary, positive feelings, reflections and beliefs have the ability to heal us and give us more energy. <br><br>  There are many studies that demonstrate that stress affects the body, and laughter can heal.  Stress is a silent killer.  And laughter is the best medicine.  Indeed, a man named Dr. Norman Cousins ‚Äã‚Äãcured himself of cancer with laughter therapy. <br><br>  Tony Robbins has certain exercises, such as an emotional flood.  It was created in order to acquaint us with the healing effect of gratitude, joy, love, passion, pride, achievement, confidence, and all the most powerful emotions. <br><br>  For example, ask yourself questions. <br><ul><li>  What do I enjoy in life? </li><li>  What am I grateful for?  Why am I happy? </li><li>  Who do i love?  Who loves me? </li><li>  What moments in my life made me laugh? </li><li>  When was I proud of myself?  What makes me the most proud? </li><li>  What were the funniest moments I had? </li></ul><br>  Such questions will shift your focus and allow you to change your own emotional state that affects your biochemistry. <br><br>  Using the <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/10-prostykh-del-kotorye-nuzhno-sdelat-posle-probuzhdeniya-chtoby-den-nachalsya-pozitivno/">morning ritual</a> , during which you allow you to fully experience such emotions, can work wonders.  On the first day of Unleash The Power Within, Tony Robbins spoke a lot about the emotional state and how to control it. <br><br>  So, having discussed the 8 gifts that need to be presented for the sake of health and energy, let's move on to 4 poisons that should be discarded or at least significantly reduced their consumption. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">Poison 1: Harm of processed fats</font> </h3><br>  You should avoid processed fats and trans fatty acids.  Saturated fats, trans fats and dietary cholesterol increase blood cholesterol levels, which is a major factor in the occurrence of coronary heart disease leading to heart attacks and also increases the risk of stroke.  Among the additional dangers posed by the processed (synthetic) fats are deterioration of blood circulation, difficulty in removing waste, blood stagnation and intoxication of the body. <br><br>  Not all fats are harmful.  You should try to consume ‚Äúgood‚Äù unsaturated fats, including the essential omega-3 fatty acids, which help reduce the risk of heart disease and cancer.  Be sure to check out the gift of essential oils mentioned above. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">Poison 2: Damage to animal meat</font> </h3><br>  Studies show: vegetarians are much healthier than meat eaters.  Vegetarians are twice less likely to die from heart disease than non-vegetarians.  Vegetarians' cholesterol levels are 14% lower than those of meat eaters.  They also have a reduced risk of heart disease, and hypertension in meat eaters occurs 13 times more often than among vegetarians. <br><br>  If we talk about cancer, the risk of lung cancer in vegetarians is 20‚Äì60% lower.  Prostate cancer is found in male vegetarians by 41% less frequently than in meat eaters.  And the risk of getting rectal cancer in women who consume meat is 250% higher than that of vegetarians. <br><br>  There is a book called ‚ÄúThe China Study <sup><a href="https://www.amazon.com/China-Study-Comprehensive-Nutrition-Implications/dp/1932100660">‚òÖ</a></sup> ‚Äù, which contains much more research on the effects of animal meat on the body.  But that's not all: our body cannot efficiently absorb the meat of animals, because it is very sour.  The chicken and beef we eat are crammed with hormones and other chemicals that have a similar effect on our health. <br><br>  If you are going to eat meat, then take care of alkalization, following rule 70/30.  It says that 70% of your diet should be vegetables, and only 30% - meat.  You should also choose natural products grown in natural conditions without antibiotics. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">Poison 3: Harm of dairy products</font> </h3><br>  Milk does not benefit the body.  Indeed, there are many studies, especially those conducted by Dr. Colin Campbell, confirming that casein (accounting for 87% of cow's milk) leads to cancer.  In addition, dairy products are very acidic and form mucus in the intestine, making its walls more rigid. <br><br>  Milk is usually believed to be a source of calcium, but in reality it is the opposite.  Since dairy products are sour, the body just borrows calcium from the bones and connective tissue to neutralize this acid. <br><br>  Choose an alternative for dairy products, such as almond milk or rice milk.  Instead of the usual cheese, use soy. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">Poison 4: Harm of Negative Dependencies</font> </h3><br>  Any of the following habits cause harm to your body.  Therefore, you should reduce the consumption of the following products or even abandon them: <br><ul><li>  caffeine; </li><li>  sugar; </li><li>  nicotine; </li><li>  alcohol; </li><li>  egg whites; </li><li>  vinegar; </li><li>  medicines. </li></ul><br>  The hardest thing for me was to give up caffeine, because I was used to using it as a ‚Äúbio-additive‚Äù before training.  But because of him after class, I fell down from exhaustion.  Over time, my susceptibility to caffeine decreased, and I needed to increase the dose.  But it's not just that: he destroyed my adrenal glands, and without them I could not live a normal life. <br><br>  As for sugar, I recommend a fantastic book called ‚ÄúSugar Blues‚Äù (‚ÄúSugarBlues‚Äù <sup><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sugar-Blues-William-Dufty/dp/0446343129">‚òÖ</a></sup> ).  She explains what sugar does in our bodies, and how it leads to diabetes and other serious health problems. <br><br>  Alcohol and vinegar have a similar effect on the body.  They instantly kill brain cells, and also suppress our immune system. <br><br>  You can consume everything in moderate doses, but make sure that 90% of the substances consumed are the result of a deliberate choice. <br><br>  Even the choice of natural cleansers, soaps, shampoos and cosmetics is important for our health and well-being.  Another great tip would be to use a shower filter that traps the chlorine that is absorbed by our skin.  There are so many things that we need to do in the modern world to make sure that we feed our body, and do not fill it with more toxins than it can remove. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">10 day check</font> </h3><br>  At the end of the ‚ÄúFree Inner Force‚Äù seminar, Tony Robbins and Joseph McClendon III offered a 10-day trial.  His goal was to use in practice 12 steps of pure energy for 10 days.  That is, giving yourself the 8 gifts listed above and reducing consumption or giving up 4 poisons. <br><br>  I've done this before and I'm used to being a vegan and raw foodist.  And it greatly changed my life.  I had a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãenergy, and my overall performance just went through the roof.  Today I can say that I am closer to the balance between fitness and health, although at the moment I am training before a fitness competition.  But I still use many of these principles, and they continue to help me lead a healthier and more energetic life. <br><br>  I recommend you explore the possibility of adherence to these principles and immediately begin to use them. <br><br>  If you want to spend a 10-day test - do it.  She will seriously change your life.  I would also suggest a 10-day test of a psychological diet that will help you clear your mind and body and create even more energy. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">Conclusion</font> </h3><br>  ‚ÄúUnleash The Power Within‚Äù is one of the most vivid impressions of my life.  I have already attended this seminar four times and, without a moment's hesitation, I would have gone to it for the fifth time.  And that's not all: I brought a lot of friends to him, because he causes a significant change.  If you have the opportunity to attend the seminar, I advise you to do this without thinking.  I hope this review ‚ÄúFree your inner strength‚Äù has given you a detailed idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat to expect from this event.  Such reports are always just a few tidbits of what you can learn, but believe me, there are so many more. <br><br>  PS We recommend another article on the topic - <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/vosem-priemov-podnyatiya-produktivnosti-kotorye-mogut-kazatsya-neveroyatnymi-no-tem-ne-menee-vesma-e/">8 methods of raising productivity, which may seem incredible, but, nevertheless, very effective</a> . <br><br>  Translated by Vyacheslav Davidenko, founder of <a href="http://www.mbaconsult.ru/">MBA Consult</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/303370/">https://habr.com/ru/post/303370/</a></p>
