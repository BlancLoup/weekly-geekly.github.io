  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How can I learn more, or why I will participate in the school CSEDays</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good day to all! <br><br>  Like many of you, I do computer science and computer science research.  And about a year ago, it came to the realization that the knowledge gained in high school in ordinary lectures is not enough.  And reading smart books does not always give a complete picture of a specific topic.  I will try to describe more specifically the problem and how to solve it. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  At the university I learned about the basics of testing in the course of OOP lectures.  We tried using JUnit in Java.  But for the most part, we corrected errors in tests, and not in the program itself.  In addition, it was felt that there was no common understanding of the problem in my head - after all, testing is not limited to JUnit tests.  It was necessary to listen to lectures by professionals in this field, or simply to meet and talk with experts and developers.  But how to implement all this?

      The logical solution to this problem was to attend specialized events.  It is possible to participate in a school or attend a conference.  But which one?  After consulting with older comrades, it was decided to choose the school <a href="http://csedays.ru/">CSEDays</a> .  There were several reasons for this.  First of all, the theme of the fall of 2010 ‚ÄúSoftware Reliability‚Äù fully corresponded to my needs.  Secondly, the lecturers were very impressive - candidates of science and specialists in software development.  Attracted by the fact that the school is supported by such large Russian companies and centers as SKB Kontur, Yandex and Microsoft Research.  So, the school is worth attention.  Thirdly, all this happened near the city of Yekaterinburg in the fresh air! <br><br>  The future participants of the event were offered a test project DOM API Testing.  Therefore, you can try your hand and discuss the results at the event. <br><br>  The event took place in November 2010!  Surprisingly, the school was able to combine the high-quality lectures on the topic and industry professionals from different parts of our country.  I learned a lot about software reliability - static methods in testing, load testing in Yandex, testing in MSSQL and much more.  I remember the ‚Äúround table‚Äù dedicated to the risks of a high-loaded information system organized by Lev Pliner from the SKB Kontur: an interesting approach to brainstorming and using thinking hats.  But the most important thing is that throughout the school a cozy atmosphere was created, which encouraged people to communicate.  Students and teachers from different universities (and even from different cities) engaged in one business received the opportunity to communicate in an informal setting and talk about the events of the computer science world in their city or university.  To maintain the informal atmosphere, various contests and games were organized (bowling, PCI, mafia, etc.).  CSEDays not only gave me new knowledge in the field of testing, but also developed an interest in many other areas of computer science. <br><br>  It was a little upset that the DOM API Testing project, which was given before the school, was hardly affected at all by the school itself, and this topic could be developed. <br><br>  The next school CSEDays was held in spring 2011. And despite the fact that it was held in the city, the level of its organization was very high.  In addition to the "eternal turmoil" of the city and the lack of fresh air, there were no visible drawbacks.  The theme of the spring school is ‚ÄúInformation Security and Cryptography‚Äù.  Once again, the lecturers and their reports were top notch.  This school was held in conjunction with the final of RuCTF 2011. RuCTF finalists automatically became participants in the school, while other participants in the school had the opportunity to get acquainted with the CTF movement. <br><br>  At such events, thanks to the possibility of free communication with many specialists from different companies and universities, there is a global exchange of knowledge.  It can be seen how the IT community is becoming more cohesive, which is good news! <br><br>  Why am I all this?  If you are a student of IT-specialty, young developer or teacher, and you still do not know where to learn new knowledge for further growth, then this school is for you!  I personally, having visited two such schools, really want to get into the third one, which will be in November of this year, the stated theme is ‚ÄúComputer networks and multi-agent systems‚Äù.  Already posted test tasks - so go for it.  After all, completed assignments increase your opportunities to receive a grant and participate in school for free!  I would be very happy to see new faces and get new acquaintances with IT specialists! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/128329/">https://habr.com/ru/post/128329/</a></p>
