      So - small office engineering systems. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  They are, there are many of them, and constant monitoring of their condition is sometimes very, very critical. <br>  I <a href="http://fixik-papus.livejournal.com/30512.html%3Fthread%3D2797616">strongly</a> advise, before further reading, to scroll through the <a href="http://fixik-papus.livejournal.com/30512.html%3Fthread%3D2797616">posts of Bio-Threats, especially the link.</a> <br><br>  Of the necessary IT systems it is worth to highlight: <br><br><ul><li>  air preparation (heating / conditioning / drying) </li><li>  ACS, </li><li>  power supply, </li><li>  firefighting. </li></ul><br>  <b>Air conditioning, heat generation calculation and BTU (British thermal unit).</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Service.</b>  <b>Chillers</b> <br><br>  Air conditioning, i.e.  heat sink, a thing in modern IT is necessary, for a simple reason - when overheating and prolonged (months) operating equipment at temperatures above +25 degrees - the service life of equipment decreases, sometimes several times (from 5-6 to 2-3 years).  The same applies to moisture - excessive moisture is harmful, because it causes even imperceptible, but condensate, and as a result - corrosion of memory contact pads, for example.  Of course, the technique can work for years, just standing under the table, but most likely this technique will not work and the three years required from it, and especially not five. <br>  Example number 1 - at the end of the text. <br><br>  The calculation of heat dissipation of equipment is simple - the power consumption of each piece of equipment is known, about the same power as the equipment will give in the form of heat.  Since the installation and calculation of air conditioning systems is usually reserved for special people, then all you need to tell them for the initial calculation is the power of your equipment in kilowatts.  Then of course the walls \ windows \ other will be added, but then. <br><br>  You can, of course, convert kilowatts to joules / sec, then to joules / hour, from there to convert to BTU / hr - British thermal unit, British thermal unit / hour, but there is nothing complicated or special about this conversion.  In addition, air conditioners are not produced individually, the power of the air conditioner is selected from a number of capacities offered by the manufacturer, so the main thing: <br><br><ul><li>  do not forget that there are two capacities of air conditioners (for heat sink and for power consumption from the network); </li><li>  turn on the air conditioner to the network through a separate fuse ON THE PHASE for sure, but it can be doubled, for phase and zero at the same time; </li><li>  Do not forget to sign this fuse directly on the dashboard. </li></ul><br>  <b>Remember that:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  pumps (condensate pumping) break </li><li>  drainage channels overgrow no matter what </li><li>  chillers may not start </li><li>  external radiators need annual cleaning before the start of the summer season, and where there are birch and poplar - and after flowering </li><li>  transition winter-summer and summer-winter always requires checking equipment and possible refueling of the refrigerant </li><li>  remember to reserve N + 1 - in the sense that the air conditioning system should work with 1 failed air conditioner indefinitely. </li></ul><br>  <b>Morality:</b> <br><br>  1. Monitor automatic temperature sensors, preferably from two points.  UPS and let's say CISCO with a thermal sensor, or what server. <br><br>  2. Do not neglect the scheduled inspection in the morning and evening.  Yes, and at lunch.  If there is security, then even if it runs at night, you never know what is there (for example, it will look through a special window at a simple household thermometer).  For a couple of years, on one site, I was guarded three times by guarding ‚Äî overheating, air conditioner failure. <br><br>  3. Refill / check (in the sense of discharging special people) air conditioners twice, in spring and autumn, before spring, rinse (at least with Karcher), and rinse after poplar fluff and flowering of birch too.  Well, before winter, after leaf fall. <br><br>  - Remember to control the temperature and humidity in general - and use the <a href="http://shop.nag.ru/catalog/00007.Avtomatizatsiya-i-monitoring">system from Nag</a> <br><br>  In 2015, they offered a kit - <br>  <a href="http://shop.nag.ru/catalog/00007.Avtomatizatsiya-i-monitoring/05629.ERD-Kontrollery/15308.SNR-ERD-GSM-11-box">SNR-ERD-GSM-1.1 - Remote control and monitoring device with GSM interface ERD-GSM, BP, chassis, antenna, mount</a> and <a href="http://shop.nag.ru/catalog/09836.IBP-UPS">UPS to it</a> <br>  plus it was possible to take smoke detectors, leaks, reed switches and so on. <br><br>  There is such a set of solutions - <br>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/nag/blog/288540/">SNR-ERD: From a ‚Äúping‚Äù machine to a line of equipment</a> <br><br>  There are alternatives - <a href="http://www.netping.ru/products/netping-dkst61-01">NetPing Device DKST61-01</a> <br><br>  Device for remote monitoring of sensors via Ethernet / Internet.

A classic example on the topic ‚Äúwhy you need to align the operating time of the main and backup equipment‚Äù.  And the mode itself: <a href="https://fixik-papus.dreamwidth.org/52284.html">read</a> <br><br>  <b>UPS / UPS, Power supply 220/380, 230/400 and sometimes even 127 V.</b> <b><br></b>  <b>380V protection</b> <br><br>  This is the suddenly unnecessary knowledge, when at least a third of Padawans are sure that the outlet, like the battery, has plus and minus, and 380 - something terrible and terrible. <br>  In fact, it was necessary to go to school and college, and remember that: <br>  <b>Mains voltage - the rms (effective) value of the voltage in an electrical AC network</b> . <br><br>  In the USSR, a three-phase current with interfacial voltage of 380 V and a phase-neutral voltage of 220 V was used in general-purpose electrical networks. According to the interstate standard GOST 29322-92 (IEC 38-83 / IEC 60038: 1983), by 2003, the transition was prescribed rated voltage 230/400 V. According to the updated GOST 29322-2014 (IEC 60038: 2009), the mains voltage should be 230/400 V at a frequency of 50 Hz ¬± 10%. <br><br>  <b>What to read on the topic</b> <br><br>  On a mandatory basis: PUE - Rules for the Electrical Installation of Electrical Installations of the Current Editions (2016, 7th edition, Ministry of Energy of the Russian Federation No. 204 of July 8, 2002). <br><br>  So you don't have a plus or a minus in the outlet, but a phase (that is, the wire where there is electricity) and neutral (where there should be no electricity, but there is a little). <br><br>  Sometimes (but less and less often) the network 127/220 is found, which means the difference between the phase and zero at 127 V, and between 2 phases - 220 V. As a result, two phases are brought into a normal socket.  In such premises, grounding must necessarily be brought into the sockets, and the grounding itself should be checked by specially trained people. <br><br>  <b>Note:</b> <br>  You should distinguish <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthing_system">TN-C from TN-S, and both of them from TN-CS</a> <br><br>  and understand why in the United States in the outlet for a washing machine can be two phases and the earth. <br>  And read the article <a href="http://www.malahit-irk.ru/index.php/2011-01-13-09-04-43/22--ltn-sr.html">Grounding system "TN-S"</a> <br><br>  As for the automatic shutdown, then there is nothing complicated.  A conventional single-phase circuit breaker is marked as A / B / C (N) - for example, C16, where C is the class of the device, 16 is the maximum current in amperes.  It should be remembered that, although there is a diverse imaginary element and cosine phi in the AC network, but for networks with a small current and a small phase shift - power can be considered as P = U * I, and for 6 amperes / 220 volts the maximum power will be only 1.3 kW.  To understand, the electric kettle 1.5-2 kilowatts of power. <br><br>  Pro classes (A / B / C / D) and the rated current of operation can of course be known, but not necessarily, not electricians.  Although "type electricians" manage to not know. <br><br>  <a href="http://cs-cs.net/avtomaty-ne-vsyo-tak-prosto-no-interesno-vybor-nominala-avtomata">Read here</a> <br><br>  <b>RCD and difavtomaty</b> <br><br>  It is better to read a separate article about it - at least about the RCD, at least about the residual current device, at least about the residual-current circuit breaker.  About trip current, A / AC types, selective RCD and so on.  A thing, of course, necessary, as well as difavtomaty. <br><br>  <b>UPS / UPS</b> <br><br>  It so happens that electricity suddenly ends, sometimes even in the whole area or city.  There can be many reasons, from the skillful work of the most terrible enemy for an IT excavator, to a fire at a substation and a shortage of power to the city as a whole. <br><br>  According to statistics, most often there is no electricity for more than 1-2 minutes, while the USSR legacy in the form of a unified energy system (not the worst legacy, but even very good) switches the power to another branch / beam.  However, there are other cases, then electricity may not be hours, and even days. <br><br>  In the first case (short power interruptions), the UPS / UPS helps. <br><br>  What you need to remember: <br><br><ul><li>  The presence of any UPS is better than its absence. </li><li>  Line-Interactive with autotransformer (AVR - Automatic voltage regulator) is better than Off-Line </li><li>  Double conversion UPS are generally good, but expensive. </li><li>  When calculating the thermal capacity of the UPS must be considered. </li><li>  The power that the UPS actually gives out at PEAK has been stopped by the last 10 years of writing, so the selection of the required power of the UPS is a topic for a separate article, written in dozens of them. </li></ul><br>  <b>What you need to know IT person about UPS / UPS APC / Delta / HP</b> <br><br>  Password reset on the APC 9619/9639 - the right lace, speed, two poke a button. <br><br>  ATTENTION!  Wrong choice of lace on the APC leads to shutdown of the UPS!  Moreover, the connector looks exactly the same, watch the wiring and do not lose the necessary lace, and better SIGN!  NEED shoelaces.  They are there at least two (with com and pin) types. <br><br>  <b>Static and dynamic UPS</b> <br><br>  Static UPS: everything is simple.  BIG battery and converters (inverters). <br><br>  <b>Dynamic UPS</b> <br><br>  In a small office do not meet.  They are set up simply - a BIG and high-speed disc, connected (physically) to the generator, and to the diesel engine. <br>  First, the generator turns the disc, then (when voltage is lost) the disc turns the generator. <br>  If the diesel engine does not start, then (for some manufacturers) at some point the disc turns the diesel engine through an (automatic electromagnetic) coupling, and then the diesel engine turns the disc and the generator. <br><br>  <b>AVR (automatic input of a reserve).</b>  <b>Diesel generators.</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Grounding</b>  <b>Electrical safety equipment.</b> <br><br>  Automatic input reserve.  A thing is useful if <br>  - the building has two inputs <br>  - there are also two inputs from the server room, <br>  - The UPS is able to eat from two inputs at once. <br>  What you need to understand: <br>  - AVR is not a replacement for the UPS, at best it is a replacement for the need to buy a diesel. <br>  An example of an ABP would be a device like <br>  APC AP7723 RM 1U Automatic Transfer Switch Autoswitch for Backup Power <br>  <b>Note</b> : there is a terminological confusion.  Sometimes, AVR refers to autorun diesel engines. <br><br>  <b>Diesel generators</b> <br><br>  In a small office do not meet. <br><br>  <b>Grounding</b>  <b>Electrical safety equipment</b> <b><br><br></b>  <b>Grounding</b> <br><br>  Thing really necessary.  Including in the form of ground bracelets on the technique.  For details, why exactly it is necessary - read the textbook of physics and EIR, in fact in the building it should be and should be checked.  Checked it or not - find out from the chief electrician / energy, he knows.  If you do not know, then consider the grounding to be absent and write service notes to the management that it is impossible to live without grounding. <br><br>  <b>Electrical safety equipment</b> <br><br>  It's all very simple - know your farm.  One of the first things to do when applying for a new job is to check the power supply.  Find out where is the electrical panel, which is responsible for the sockets of the server and working equipment, what kind of automata there are, whether there are UZOs, what was with the power supply before and how often the automata worked on overloading.  Check that all your sockets are signed in place, and above the shield with your machines there is an inscription ‚ÄúIT group automats‚Äù.  In the most unpleasant case, no one will search for the ‚Äúlog of the distribution of emergency switch groups‚Äù.  By the way, if the room is on the key, then it is best to make sure that the key is in the accessibility zone, at the security guards or in the famous electricians' room, and at least once a quarter to check that the key is still at the same place, and that this is exactly the key, and he opens this door.  And by the way, you should keep a carbon dioxide fire extinguisher in front of the electrical panel. <br><br>  <b>About Krivorukov.</b>  <b>And fakapy</b> <br><br>  IS ALWAYS!  IS ALWAYS!!!  Check for these Krivorukov electricians, so that they, bad people, led to the bulky core! <br><br>  Real case, by the way.  Electricians for laziness (because the sleeves WAS. In an inconspicuous bag on the side, but WAS) brought a multi-core under the terminal screw. <br><br>  ALWAYS carry a testing screwdriver (indicator screwdriver) with you. <br>  ALWAYS check the case with a screwdriver, EVEN after turning off the power. <br>  PUE directly prescribes testing first with a tester, then with the back of the hand, and only then touch it. <br>  The real case - instead of the earth, there was a phase in the socket, and from the case of the equipment it was beaten with current. <br>  Another real case - Krivorukov electricians laid the wires under the fasteners of the external (street) unit, the wire frayed - the phase on the body - the corpse. <br>  With the fact that the technique "like" was turned off. <br>  Phase can be in just a long hanging wire. <br>  Wires can be confused in the shield. <br>  Be careful, take care.  Honor Pue. <br><br>  <b>ACS and other safety</b> <br><br>  In the case of IT, the most often ACS is of two types - video recorders and access control systems on Proximity / Em-marin cards. <br>  DVRs do not represent anything special - they are analog cameras with an analog line, plus converters from analog to digital format (almost a TV tuner card), they write to the hard disk of the server. <br><br>  The second option is digital cameras that transmit data directly in digital format (via ip) to a video surveillance server.  Most often already installed and configured, the choice of "what and how" changes every year, so there are no universal tips for this technique.  In addition to the advice "as for any technology" - to isolate from the rest of the network (the video server has nothing to do on the Internet and in the local network), to use UPS and backup. <br><br>  POE and other nutrition is better to untie with the general network, to study the topic of "lightning protection" and "optogalvanic isolation". <br><br>  <b>ACS</b> , for example, the same car, is a system of "server - com-port - reader."  The server stores photos, unique card numbers, passwords to them (if needed), and ‚Äúwhat's where‚Äù schemes.  The controller on the com-port through the attached software slowly and sadly sends this data, then the card numbers are already stored in the controller.  No special skills are required for management and maintenance. <br>  Previously, the car had one-day courses "what it is and how it works." <br><br>  <b>Gas, powder and Novec 1230 fire extinguishing systems.</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Gas masks isolating and filtering</b> <br><br>  Before talking about fire extinguishing systems, it is worth remembering about warning systems.  Most often, this is a series of boxes under the ceilings with smoke detectors (they work for dust) and temperature sensors (there is nothing to do with Wood‚Äôs alloy). <br>  For the water quenching system, valves with a glass flask with liquid are used. <br><br>  For notification, a number of speakers are used by floor. <br>  The only task in this case is to find (when applying for a job) a fire safety officer and ask how long the sensors were checked (most often they are checked once a month and once a quarter they are checked for drawdown, what the corresponding log is about) and how it works and whether the alert system works.  In practice, although not mine, there was a case when the warning system was turned off at the request of not even the past, but before the previous landlord, so that it was turned on during a scheduled inspection, and no longer worried about non-triggering. <br><br>  <b>Fire behavior</b> <br><br>  Behavior in case of fire for an employee is described in a standard instruction, with which the safety officer comes to each new employee and introduces a signature.  Most often, employee behavior is described in two points. <br><br><ul><li>  In case of personal fire detection, notify others, activate a fire alarm, evacuate according to an evacuation plan, call a fire brigade. </li><li>  When a fire alarm is triggered, evacuate according to the plan, call the fire brigade. </li><li>  Sometimes the head of the department is in the instructions item "count the runaway and make sure that all evacuated from the department." </li></ul><br>  If the employee is responsible for this very TB, EB, and other fire safety, then there are much more responsibilities, which will be long and tediously told on the relevant courses, giving up a red book as a result. <br><br>  <b>Fire extinguishing systems</b> <br><br>  The powder quenching system is, in fact, a box with a kilogram (and more) of chalk.  For installation in the server is not suitable, since the equipment after the application of such a system is likely to be kapuuuuuuut. <br>  Gas fire extinguishing system - an armored fire-gas-resistant door is placed in the room, and a nitrogen tank is placed in the room.  When the system is triggered, nitrogen enters the room, which displaces oxygen and there is nothing to burn.  There are some problems with increasing pressure, but this point needs to be clarified when designing the installation of such a system.  The main problem is that when this system is triggered, it is necessary to run away immediately, because a person breathes oxygen and a minute or two lives without it.  Existence of the isolating gas mask with regeneration - at will. <br>  There is a problem of equipment failure from noise and vibration when the system is triggered. <br>  <b>Fire extinguishing systems on Novec 1230</b> <br><br>  In fact, the gas (chladone) system, but softer in pressure and effect on the human body accidentally caught in the quenching zone.  You can have time to escape. <br>  You can read about it for example on Habr√©: <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/3mrussia/blog/200840/">here</a> or <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/194268/">here</a> <br><br>  <b>Gas masks isolating and filtering</b> <br><br>  1. It is NEVER necessary to climb into the fire zone. <br>  2. From the zone of application of fire extinguishing systems, it is necessary to leave immediately. <br>  3. Filter masks, respirators and so on in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãapplication of fire extinguishing systems are NOT APPLICABLE.  There is no oxygen - it is all supplanted by the gas mixture. <br><br>  <b>Other engineering systems.</b>  <b>Construction in general</b> <br><br>  Planning the placement and transportation of equipment. <br>  From other engineering systems, I came across perhaps old telephony, on 50 greenhouses and divorced into the same old cabinets. <br>  It often happens in old factories, for example.  Sometimes it even works. <br>  Sometimes a VERY IMPORTANT service is tied to it.  Which is not documented anywhere - for example alarm, or ADSL installed 20 years ago.  Be careful when disconnecting. <br><br>  <b>Construction in general.</b>  <b>Planning the placement and transportation of equipment</b> <br><br>  The need for this short paragraph reminded me of a well-known story - "Issue 3. Miracle heroes."  I highly recommend finding and reading, twice.  So, the problem of technology and cabinets is that cabinets (especially UPS, sizes from symmetries and above) are really heavy.  Half a ton is easy.  It happens more. <br><br>  A stuffed closet can weigh a ton.  Accordingly, design, take into account and control the carrying capacity of the floor, and what you actually fit to the sockets (for example, if you have an old aluminum crumbling shit laid out), and how you will organize the drift / removal of the cabinet from your room.  120-150 kg empty cabinet. <br><br>  For advanced employees - when designing, one should remember such things as floor plans, with indication of electrical wiring, all sorts of channels, heating, air blower, water of every kind and sewage.  It is desirable, of course, to keep a copy of all the circuits in oneself and be friends with the building management service - plumbers, electricians, monitoring services for all kinds of fire smoke detectors and other detectors, telephonists, air conditioners and so on. <br><br>  <b>What to read:</b> <br><br>  PUE - Rules for electrical installation of electrical installations PUE of the current edition (for 2016 - 7th edition, the Ministry of Energy of Russia dated July 08, 2002 No. 204). <br>  The car - an introductory course on ACS. <br>  Building codes and regulations (SNiP) <br>  GOST R 50345-2010: Small-size electrical equipment.

When the system enters such a mode, it leaves it only by reboot, i.e.  stopping disk operations and waiting for the release of the cache does not save. <br><br>  The problem manifested itself only after connecting new disks.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is definitely not related to the size of the volume (not the physical device), since On this system, Storage Space was successfully operated in 12 TB (4x4 TB Single Parity). </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The AHCI controller drivers tried the built-in and two versions from Intel (2013, 2014, 12 and 13 major versions). </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There is no anti-virus (the built-in one is deleted at all, not disabled, but deleted).
