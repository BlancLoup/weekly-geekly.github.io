And this is all that I will say in this topic about Internet Explorer. <br><br>  This post will be unavailable to some in view of their online experience, while others may seem a bit sentimental.  You will not acquire special knowledge in this article and will not discover anything new.  The post is journalistic and only the Internet will be interesting for old-timers.  But if you like stories then you will be interested. <br><br>  The idea to write this post was thrown to me by a recent post about closing the Aport.  I hit the memories and decided to share them with others.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  I first came to the Internet in 1998.  Actually, I didn‚Äôt have internet at home due to the lack of a home phone, and I had to sit in Internet clubs, which at that time began to multiply at incredible speeds.  While sitting at computer clubs at night, I was surfing the Internet literally mesmerized by chat rooms (which you wouldn‚Äôt believe even allowed to communicate with America), got mail on any mail server I was getting to, and downloaded very funny pictures from everywhere. <br><br>  The internet seemed like a miracle.  In the mornings, I absolutely didn‚Äôt want to get up from the computer.  In general, I became addicted to the internet.  And computer clubs get rich at my expense. <br><br>  In general, everything happened by chance.  For some promotions in the club I got playing time with the Internet.  I accidentally launched Explorer.  The homepage of the site was set <a href="http://omen.ru/INDEX.HTM">Omen.ru</a> (Link to WM) is the site where all sorts of things gathered.  On this site I spent a few years.  There was a post office, chats, jokes, news, funny pictures ... In a word, what was nowhere in such quantity.  Was cool.  Surfing the Internet, I started with it.  <a href="http://omen.ru/INDEX.HTM">Here is the favorite version of Omen</a> .  For those times, the design was mega cool.  Pay attention to the circle "Stars".  There is a photo of Xena - the warrior queen, from the series that I watched without missing a single series.  And pay attention to the headlines in the right column.  Today it is ridiculous, but then I read them all, because besides the TV news there was nowhere to find, and even so interesting. <br><br>  And there was also a site fomenko.ru.  Probably in those years it was the most visited site in runet.  After all, this is the first site that was advertised in the media.  Nikolai Fomenko did the whips on Russian Radio and there they constantly pointed out the link to this site.  It is surprising that since those years the site has not changed much, including the design.  He remained probably as a monument to Runet. <br><br>  Favorite search engine was Aport.  He began to use it when he was <a href="http://www.aport.ru/">like this</a> .  Pay attention to the coding links above.  In those years, if the site was professional, such links should have been on it.  What would any of the users do not deny access to the site.  In 2000, the search engine was updated and became <a href="http://aport.ru/">so</a> .  Especially <a href="http://www.aport.ru/info/WINP/">this</a> page is nostalgic. <br><br>  In the same years (early 2000s), I decided that it was time for me to start making my websites.  I knew almost nothing and knew little.  The sites were not made on BASIC, as in Pascal, and I began to learn CTML, and tested everything on narod.ru.  Then he was <a href="http://narod.yandex.ru/">like that</a> .  And his parent Yandex is <a href="http://yandex.ru/">like this</a> .  (There are links to encodings again ... cool, eh?) I began to use Yandex when it became <a href="http://www.yandex.ru/">such</a> and only did it because of the mail. <br><br>  Those times can be called the times of the builders-pioneers of the RuNet.  New sites opened more often.  The horizons were constantly growing ... If in 98 and 99 I knew almost all the RuNet, then in 2000 I did not have time to keep track of the emergence of more and more new sites.  Then I still believed that the day would come when I read the entire Internet.  Now no one would ever think of such a thing, but in those years such an idea was normal (I know from other people who also became Internet addicts).  But I digress.  Let's return to the sites of those years. <br><br>  One of the favorite sites of those years was <a href="http://krovatka.ru/">krovatka.ru</a> and <a href="http://chatcity.ru/index.shtml">chatcity.ru</a> .  The second is also a monument by the way.  For almost no change since those years.  And the TOP chats that are stored in the history of the link, I was visited every day. <br><br>  Favorite mail server was <a href="http://www.krovatka.net/">hotbox.ru</a> .  His story was difficult and on this day sank into oblivion. <br><br>  Today, with personal stories I want to finish.  In the end I will only give a few interesting references on the topic. <br><br>  The history of the development of many popular sites that began to form in those years and how they changed over time can be well traced using the <a href="http://wayback.archive.org/web/">wayback machine</a> <br><br>  About the history of Runet can tell these links <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A0%25D1%2583%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582">Vika about Runet</a> , <a href="http://www.kovrik.com/sib/internet/RussianNetStory.html">Rashn No Storey</a> and the <a href="http://ru.arf.ru/Hrono/index.html">Chronology of the History of Runet</a> <br><br>  And finally, the <a href="http://the-best-of-thebest.diary.ru/p177769354.htm%3Foam">first designs of popular sites</a> <br><br>  P.S.  Link from <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/divanikus/" class="user_link">divanikus</a> to a <a href="">warm tube web 1.0</a> .  Everything written by reference is true. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/150676/">https://habr.com/ru/post/150676/</a></p>
