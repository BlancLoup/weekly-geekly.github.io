It would seem, and here any scribbling, when in the next posts you can read about how to glue a VAZ 2106 from a box of matches or how to assemble a cold nuclear fusion reactor in the basement?  I just want to talk not about working with my hands, but about working with my head and pen :) <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Not so long ago, I caught myself thinking that I had not written anything for a long time on Habr.  And not because they did not want or had nothing to write about.  Just ran, a lot of work, little time and all that jazz (I foresee trolls in the comments about ‚Äúit‚Äôs better if I didn‚Äôt write‚Äù and ‚Äúmortal boredom, KG / AM‚Äù).  Do you know why it is so annoying?  Here I look, say, at modern IT students after university.  They have several courses behind them - C ++, Java, maybe, an assembler.  And these students are divided into three categories: <br><ul><li>  The first ones at the university realize that IT is not their sphere, and they are going to get a job as managers (everyone wants to be managers, not sellers, fi); </li><li>  The second, on the contrary, in addition to the knowledge that Old Believers teachers drive in with a mallet, they themselves study various technologies, write programs, go to work in serious companies before they graduate from the university; </li><li>  But with the third more difficult.  Still others have the ambitions of the first and at the same time think that they are the second.  Well, of course, I completed the course in several serious programming languages, which means that I can go and get settled to write cool business applications and get tons of cabbage.  Do you even know how difficult it is to work with registers in assembler ?? </li></ul><br>  However, contrary to what one might have thought, this article is not about how bad things are for modern youth and why people who don‚Äôt distinguish functions from variables come to the interview, and the variables are called Pok√©mon names because "so cute." <br><br>  Here, say, there is such a profession - an evangelist.  Serious business uncles argue that the evangelist is an intermediary between marketers and technologists, whose task is to bring the light of new technologies to the dark, near-technical masses.  Let it be so, but I will allow myself to translate the vector a little.

      I do not attribute myself to evangelists.  Honestly, I have never been interested in the marketing side of the issue - well, for example, how much money Ballmer will get if I suddenly get drunk on Twitter that silverlight is cool.  And at the same time, I am very happy to people who ask questions after the articles on the topic, who are looking for contacts of the authors and write to them.  ‚ÄúWhy do you write in Python and not in PHP?‚Äù, ‚ÄúListen, what is the difference between staticmethod and classmethod?‚Äù Or even sacred ‚ÄúThey say you can't use goto - but I used it, I liked it.  I am bad?".  Yes, damn it, I love to share knowledge, I love when I have, with whom to argue about the choice of technology or something like that.  Honestly, if I didn‚Äôt like practical programming so much, I would have long since gotten all the comrades of habrovans with all sorts of boring articles. <br><br>  And most importantly, I want more people like that.  Are you an evangelist?  Fine!  If you "confess" some interesting technology - write more about it!  Are you a programmer?  Gorgeous!  Write not for marketing purposes, to sell more copies, but just learn how to get high, building letters so that there are as many interested people as possible.  Do not complain that the people went illiterate - who else can bring up the next generation of programmers? <br><br>  I beg you, do not turn Habr into another media and political blog.  All these assemblies of advertising programs for the iPhone, reviews of cool hardware are, of course, good.  But a person who reads the ten thousandth review of AngryBirds on an IT site will not understand what it is written on and why the bird is flying this way and not otherwise. <br><br>  And yet - do not be afraid.  It is not necessary to be a severe IT specialist to write articles full of deep technological meaning.  Explore technology that interests you, and then write about them in order to gain like-minded people and work together in the future. <br><br>  In general, you want an interesting job instead of picking the websites on ready-made engines, interesting interviewees and expensive cars - Do It Yourself! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/123265/">https://habr.com/ru/post/123265/</a></p>
