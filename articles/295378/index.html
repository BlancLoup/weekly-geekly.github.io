"</i> </blockquote><br>  Most of what the beginning founders do is like a ‚Äúleap of faith‚Äù: belief in yourself and your idea is beyond rational argumentation.  There are a number of silently repeated mantras that can push us to deceit and force us to begin implementing business ideas that could cost us all our livelihood.  Here are some examples of misconceptions explaining their fallacies.  This list will help to avoid popular tragic delusions both to beginners and practicing investors, for whom these errors will be like red flags. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  I came up with something that had never happened before.  It'll be cool! </h4><br>  You never wondered why when you type in the search engine some utter garbage that you just invented, it gives you a bunch of links to this very garbage?  In 99, (9)% of cases, what has just been invented came to someone earlier than you, and if you do not see the implementation, then there are two options, either nobody needs it, or you simply did not find it. <br><br><h4>  I have a fresh perspective, maybe the people working in this area are too blind to see this cool opportunity. </h4><br>  So talk only amateurs.  When you plunge into a certain sphere, you will be unpleasantly surprised by the various obstacles to the realization of your brilliant ideas.  Get ready to adapt to the requirements of the market, pivot is inevitable. <br><br><h4>  My application will look better than a bunch of old stuff in appstore and playmarket. </h4><br>  Most likely it will not be if you are certainly not the coolest UX developer, which is highly unlikely, plus the existing players in the market can easily update their applications and, given the already established market conditions, you will lose nothing.

    <h4>  My application will be more functional than competing. </h4><br>  First, it is difficult to briefly tell the investor about those cool features that you want to fit into the functionality of your application.  Secondly, it is very difficult to get loyal enthusiasts of the new application.  Thirdly, the more features you need to cram into the application, the more the development of this application will cost, and judging by the fact that you are a beginner, it is not difficult to guess that there is vacuum or very thin air in your pocket, but even if it is not, then all your money will be spent on development and you will not have any funds left for promotion to the masses. <br><br><h4>  Everyone with whom I spoke really liked my idea. </h4><br>  Most likely you talked with friends and acquaintances who simply did not want to offend you, seeing your burning gaze and insane sketches on napkins in a coffee shop.  Say that your idea is brilliant and open for you your wallet wide open is not at all equivalent actions, do not you find? <br><br><h4>  The concept that I have invented is so complex that it will take several years for someone to repeat it. </h4><br>  First, do not flatter yourself, a whole staff of cool reversers and developers can work with competitors.  Secondly, if the concept is really as complex as you think, then think how much time do you need for its implementation? <br><br><h4>  I, personally, are more motivated than anyone else in the whole wide world. </h4><br>  Strange, but who are all these people about whom they write in tehnoblog and business publications?  Welcome to the club, you are the 100,500th in line. <br><br>  There are, of course, examples that are noticeable to everyone who have really succeeded.  For example, Slack has no killer feature, but it came out.  At first glance, success cannot be explained, but recall that Stuart Butterfield is still the co-founder of Flickr. <br><br>  Before you quit working ‚Äúfor uncle‚Äù full-time, and when you are ready to jump into the rabbit hole, take a moment to think about what should lead to a successful outcome of your idea.  If there is a firm understanding of the market for which they are going to climb and a strategy has been drawn up to attract initial customers, gather courage and make this ‚Äúleap of faith‚Äù.  Just make sure your faith is not based on the principles outlined above. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a7e/e9f/c97/a7ee9fc9742a4ba38d6ef0bfd50b6f6a.jpg" alt="Leap of Faith 2"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/295378/">https://habr.com/ru/post/295378/</a></p>
