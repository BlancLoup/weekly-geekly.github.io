  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Apple Pay as a mobile payment engine in Japan</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This year has been very successful for the Japanese market of mobile services.  First, this is the launch of the Nintendo gaming mobile game Pok√©mon Go, which has gathered millions of active users around the world who are chasing, armed with smartphones and smart watches, Pikachas and Blastose.  Secondly, Apple CEO Tim Cook (Tim Cook) announced that iPhone 7 users will be able to enjoy a special version of Super Mario on new devices.  Finally, there is great news for the Japanese mobile payment market.  You might be surprised, but Apple Pay service is only recently introduced in this country, however, we expect that its appearance will lead to a sharp increase in the number of payment transactions.  What are these expectations based on? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a05/188/2eb/a051882eb9514682bfd15e925caafcb9.jpg" width="100%"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Japan is not only one of the world leaders in the development of computer games, automotive technology and robotics, but already occupies a leading position in the field of mobile payments and <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/gemaltorussia/blog/310008/">NFC technologies</a> .  Since 2011, a mobile wallet Osaifu Keitai has been operating in Japan, with which you can pay for public transport and various purchases.  Currently in supermarkets, cafes and fast food restaurants in Japan there are 1.9 million contactless payment terminals.  Over the past year, the volume of non-cash transactions in stores amounted to 4.6 trillion yen (about $ 46 billion).  In fact, today many people in Japan do not even think about taking a wallet with them when they leave the house - they get along fine without it, paying for purchases using a mobile phone.  However, growth potential remains. <br><br><h3>  Apple Pay Security </h3><br>  Since mid-September, due to the launch of Apple Pay, the volume of contactless payments in the country began to grow at a higher rate - and in many respects thanks to our participation, for mobile payments to work properly and gain wide popularity, it is extremely important that this technology is safe and user-friendly.

      We are pleased to announce that Gemalto will work with Dai Nippon Printing (DNP) to create a cloud payment service that will support Apple Pay.  To prevent fraudulent actions, this solution will use tokenization technology, which will allow not to disclose credit card numbers. <br><br>  Features of the DNP cloud payment service for Apple Pay devices: <br><br><ul><li>  Provides payment card issuers the opportunity and platform to make mobile payments using Apple Pay on new Apple devices in Japan. </li><li>  Services hosted in the DNP data center provide enhanced security through tokenization technology. </li><li>  Supports multi-branded card issuance and payment with support for national payment services, such as iD from NTT DOCOMO or QUICPay from JCB, as well as EMV-based payment services, such as MasterCard Contactless. </li></ul><br>  It is important to note here that security procedures will not affect the speed and simplicity of mobile payments.  However, the solution is also convenient in that it allows Japanese users to manage their domestic and international mobile wallets with Apple Pay using FeliCa and MasterCard.  Thus, Japanese users will be able to pay for purchases using their mobile wallets, making transactions from applications. <br><br>  We have already observed the experience of other countries, as the introduction of innovations in the field of mobile payments was followed by a huge increase in the volume of mobile transactions.  According to the forecasts of research firm Strategy Analytics, by 2021 the amount of payments made in Japan through credit, debit and prepaid cards will exceed $ 30 billion, however, the firm‚Äôs experts do not exclude that the launch of Apple Pay service may force them to reconsider their forecast.  And we are not at all surprised if within the next decade paper money and coins will completely disappear from circulation in Japan. <br><br>  <i>What do you think about the launch of Apple Pay in Japan, and in Russia?</i>  <i>Share your opinion in the comments below.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/315222/">https://habr.com/ru/post/315222/</a></p>
