  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Duplication of information</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good time of day <br><br>  Very long time watching the Internet as a whole and only one thought comes to mind - why all this and who needs it.  I will explain.  Somewhere there was a post that there is a lot of information on the Internet (it was indicated in numbers), but is this information useful? <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Duplication </h4><br>  The most striking example of duplication of information are social networks and various services (Digg and others).  Take the same digg.  It clearly indicates the number of times the topic has been published.  So why?  Is not enough one publication?  You can explain it this way - each person enters into the suitcase only what he is interested in.  You can understand, I would just then make this very suitcase a personal space and did not show it to anyone.

      Another vivid example is Twitter.  I love him and he recently began to take part there.  But when I observe the flow of information and its duplicates - I come to the conclusion - to be informed it is enough to subscribe once to someone who is already active in the industry of interest.  The rest are like penguin clones. <br><br><h4>  Duplication number 2 </h4><br>  Another reason for my brain processes is duplication of accounts on the Internet as a whole.  Each site, each startup wants to build its user base and show friends what their popular site is.  I think the leaders are more or less clear.  These are world-famous services and social networks (Facebook, Twitter, WordPress, Google, YouTube, etc.) and if a person has already been registered there, then what does he do on the next site?  That's right, or repeats their data, or simply comes up with temporary, in order to see what is happening inside the next, interesting and not very, project. <br><br>  I use both hands for OpenID, OAuth, XAuth and other technologies that save everyone from unnecessary gestures.  And when building another project, one should think about openness and availability, i.e.  thoughts like "users already have, it remains only to attract them" will be useful to everyone.  Registrations where everyone required an E-Mail address, using the old school, that E-Mail addresses are very important (for subsequent distribution).  Spam so 80% of the entire Internet, and even more.  We use OpenID and thus we clear the Internet. <br><br><h4>  Duplication number 3 </h4><br>  And the third thought, which does not give rest.  Why copy completely foreign projects?  The same Twitter copied the n-th number of times, and the site opens with the content: "Download this script, install and get a copy of Twitter."  And for what?  There are still many free niches on the Internet to begin with, but everyone is eager to repeat and copy what has already been done and works well.  Here, many will begin to explain that they say "competition, made the project and get the cash through advertising, advancement" and more.  As Peter Daniels said: "Do better than your competitors, or do not do it at all."  1000 and 1 service did not improve Twitter at all, but simply copied not completely. <br><br>  Not only Twitter, but also questionnaire sites, commentator sites, sharing sites and so on.  There is already enough and even too much.  I am browsing the FeedMyApp catalog and every day there is a new bundle of sites and services, but we unscrew 2-3 pages back and get the previous copies. <br><br><h4>  Afterword </h4><br>  More than ever, the internet needs cleaning and recycling.  Google began to understand this and it pleases.  Everyone already knows the modern saying: ‚ÄúThere is everything on the Internet, but not what is needed.‚Äù  Everyone knows and continues to duplicate.  The Internet has more than 120 million domain names (¬± 30 million).  Every day, many sites and services appear and disappear.  But my vision is that only 20% of the entire Internet is unique information, the rest is duplicate. <br><br>  The topic was raised and more than once, I am writing, because it was just boiling after the next mega-project, where you need to enter 1000 and one field for registration. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/96487/">https://habr.com/ru/post/96487/</a></p>
