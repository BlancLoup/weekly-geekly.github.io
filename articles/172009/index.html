Today, March 8 (by the way, girls, congratulations!) And some men want to please their women and free them from ‚Äúslave labor‚Äù in the kitchen, and another part is to cook not traditional dumplings \ sausages for sausages, but something more substantial. <br>  Here are some proven recipes that will come in handy for both the first and second. <br><br>  <b>Caution, a lot of pictures.</b>  <b>Do not go hungry!</b> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Breakfast </h4><br>  Strictly speaking, breakfast is an important part of the day, giving strength to the first half of it, so ignoring it is not very useful.  Therefore, it is advisable to spend some time after waking up and bungle it for yourself. <br><br><h5>  Ate - and order </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ecd/3bd/c2e/ecd3bdc2ebe665f45e6328e3a63eade7.jpg" alt="image" align="right">  As a "tube of space food", when there is absolutely no time for cooking, you can use curd cheese curds (only they have to be chosen very carefully, almost all rubles are cheaper - soybean crap).  One or two syr for breakfast and you are guaranteed no feeling of hunger before lunch. <br>  A little more complicated - curd desserts (Activia, Bio-max, Miracle).  You can eat in a couple of minutes and quite nourishing.

      Good also helps a sandwich with cheese or sausage.  You can also add tomatoes, cucumbers, herbs, butter or some melted cheese.  In general, do not deny yourself the pleasure. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3de/cc4/dcc/3decc4dcc58cc443d420be3037fdc55b.jpg" alt="image" align="right">  Further, on the complexity go muesli or even breakfast cereals (only choose with a lower sugar content).  They poured into a cup, poured milk with kefir / yogurt, waited a couple of minutes and could be eaten. <br><br>  The oatmeal is also good for coping with morning hunger: pour them into a bowl, add frozen berries and fruits, pour in hot water, wait a couple of minutes - it's ready.  You can also pour jam or condensed milk, if you are not afraid that something will stick together) <br><br><h5>  Breakfast with cooking </h5><br>  In general, the body is well recharged in the morning, of course, eggs.  There are few basic recipes here, but their variations do not have a number. <br><br><h6>  Eggs can be cooked </h6><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/30c/d15/30c/30cd1530c1062cd001b581548bf5ce1d.jpg" alt="image" align="right">  We take 1-2-3 eggs, put them in a dipper, put them on a fire, the water boils, wait 2-3 minutes (depending on the rate of water heating by your stove) - we get <b>soft-boiled</b> eggs when the yolk is liquid;  waiting for 4-5 minutes - get the eggs <b>"in the bag"</b> - part of the yolk is liquid, but the bulk is already curled;  wait 10 minutes - get hard <b>boiled eggs</b> - an ingredient in many salads and just a dish that can be eaten with mayonnaise or ketchup.  Upon reaching the desired time, the scoop with the eggs - under cold water to cool down faster.  And you can eat. <br><br>  Here are some tips: do not trust your ability to detect time with the power of thought, buy a kitchen timer or put a reminder on the phone - it helps a lot.  To speed up the process (this advice applies generally to all cooking that requires boiling water) you can boil water in an electric kettle, and then pour it into a dipper or saucepan, but it is better not to wait for boiling in the kettle, as double boiling water can already cause to the deposition in it of all filth. <br><br>  <a href="">By the</a> way, you can buy an <a href="">egg cooker</a> (500-1000 rubles), but this is if you really like eggs, and it will gather dust on the shelf until the big holidays, when you need 6-8 pieces to cook right away. <br><br>  By the way, you can make a ‚Äúrestaurant serving‚Äù type - poached eggs that are boiled without shell in boiling water: boil water, reduce heat, break the shell and pour the egg into a bowl, and from the bowl gently into boiling water.  Next, cook for 1-4 minutes (depending on the desired consistency of the yolk), get a skimmer (such a large spoon with holes). <br>  In general, comprehensive information on boiled eggs can be found here: <a href="http://supercook.ru/zz124-01.html">supercook.ru/zz124-01.html</a> <br><br><h6>  Eggs can also be fried </h6><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e5e/ee8/17c/e5eee817c878e364f933965ed1d5c033.jpg" alt="image" align="right">  Actually the most masculine dish.  Pour some sunflower oil into the pan, smearing it all over the pan, put it on a strong fire.  When the pan warms up (red indicator in the center, drop a drop of water to make it hiss, check ‚Äúheat‚Äù with your hand) - reduce the heat, break the necessary number of eggs with the knife over the pan: in one hand an egg, in the other a knife chopped, then fingers "open" the shell and carefully pour the contents into the pan.  Salt, pepper, you can add herbs.  Fry until the protein is firm and the edges are covered with a crust, then carefully remove the spatula and on the plate.  Bottom should not burn.  If it burns, you cook on too much fire. <br><br>  Of course, ‚Äúnaked‚Äù scrambled eggs are pretty boring and quickly annoying.  But it can be prepared in a million different ways.  With sausages, tomatoes, cheese, croutons, vegetables.  Here, for example, <a href="http://www.gotovim.ru/recepts/snack/fried_eggs/p://www.gotovim.ru/recepts/snack/fried_eggs/">80 recipes</a> . <br>  The basic idea is that since scrambled eggs are cooked very quickly, we first prepare an ‚Äúextra piece‚Äù, that is, we fry sausages or tomatoes, or pieces of bread, just soaked in milk or water, and then add eggs.  In general, experiment! <br><br><h6>  Omelette </h6><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/acf/edb/b0b/acfedbb0b10a6acb8ddff133c9679a62.jpg" alt="image" align="right">  Very cool and tasty dish.  The main difference - the eggs are whipped.  Most often with milk or cream, but in case of emergency it is possible with sour cream, kefir, in general any sour milk and even water.  The complexity depends on the availability of home "kitchen gadgets": blender-mixer-whisk-fork (sequence depending on the speed of preparation).  We put the pan on the fire, add sunflower or butter (some connoisseurs recommend butter), smear it in the pan.  Next, beat the eggs (for 1 portion you can 2 or 3) with our ‚Äúdevice‚Äù to mix the whites and yolks, then add half a cup of milk (sour milk / water) or 30 grams of cream, salt, pepper, add greens if desired and continue to beat.  When it turns out more or less homogeneous mass - carefully pour it into the pan and close the lid.  Reduce the heat and fry for about 10 minutes so that the omelette shakes from the pan movements.  Remove with a spatula, cutting the whole omelette into 3-4 slices. <br><br>  Omelette, again, is good for its variations.  Very tasty omelet with tomatoes, and even eat with sausages, vegetables, herbs, cheese, mushrooms, beans, and even yesterday's half-eaten side dish :). <br>  Learn more about omelets <a href="http://supercook.ru/zz124-06.html">here</a> or <a href="http://www.russianfood.com/recipes/bytype/%3Ffid%3D611">here</a> . <br><br><h4>  Salads </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/880/9d3/1bd/8809d31bd1ae204e7ffc07bf1b2d9dce.jpg" alt="image" align="right">  Salads are, firstly, a wide field for experiments, secondly, full-fledged healthy and nourishing food, thirdly, an excellent addition to almost any second dish. <br>  When I was a student, I made myself such an <b>express salad</b> almost every day: cut a tomato in half, still in half, and then into a ‚Äúsector‚Äù;  we cut the cucumber lengthwise into 2 halves, then into the semicircle (it's harder to describe than do, trust me) and tear a couple of sheets of lettuce with our hands, add salt and pour olive oil.  Even under every heated fast food rolls. <br><br>  The simplest one is, probably, just <b>tomato cucumbers</b> .  We cut and that, and another, as your heart desires, refuel, than you wish (butter, sour cream, mayonnaise) - it is ready.  You can add more peppers, cabbage, canned peas, beans, radishes, apples, boiled potatoes, beets, chicken, cheese, sausage, crab sticks, mushrooms, and here you have 100,500 different salads.  You can also experiment with dressings and cutting method (cubes, straw, bars). <br><br>  <b>‚ÄúOlivier‚Äù</b> and <b>‚Äúcrab sticks‚Äù</b> (by the way, abroad it is called ‚ÄúRussian salad :)), I am sure that each of us is familiar, so let's leave it outside the material. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/623/b21/061/623b21061fc9509e6c29b33ec1b7a8e0.jpg" alt="image" align="right">  Of the "complex" salads, one of my favorite and easiest to prepare is <b>"like Caesar</b> . <b>"</b> <br>  Smoked breast (you‚Äôll find them damn horseradish, real ones, you‚Äôll come across completely with the ‚Äúsmell of smoking‚Äù, whi) - well, there‚Äôs about 300 grams in it. <br>  Lettuce leaves - 3-4. <br>  Rusks are white (!) (In my opinion, only ‚ÄúKompashki‚Äù are left) - a couple of packs. <br>  Cheese - 50 grams <br>  We cut the breast, we cut the cheese into cubes (you can also rub it on the grater), we tear the salad or finely cut, we throw the croutons (right away, if you want them to be softer or already when serving, to be like croutons), we pour "Sloboda", the practical only more or less natural).  Everything.  Very tasty and satisfying. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/67a/86c/75c/67a86c75c363993d88e06eb8faa27040.jpg" alt="image" align="right">  Several hints speeding up the process using gadgets.  Here it can be useful: <br>  - <b>potato peeler</b> (from 1000), but requires even potatoes and ‚Äúeyes‚Äù and then ‚Äúdig out‚Äù anyway; <br>  - a <b>double boiler or a multi-cooker</b> with this function (from 2000, accelerates the cooking of the same potato and beet, as well as chicken and fish) 1.5 times; <br>  - <b>blender-mixer-kitchen processor</b> (from 1500 rubles).  In general, modern manufacturers of kitchen appliances have learned to embed anything in anything, so a blender can be built into the mixer, a mixer into a blender, and into a food processor so everything from a chopper to a slicer.  The most useful of the whole park, IMHO, a blender in the form of a ‚Äúleg with knives‚Äù, as well as a chopper, and preferably a smaller one, you will not cook for the most part; <br>  - <b>egg cooker</b> (500-1000 rubles); <br>  - <b>kitchen scales</b> (from 300 rubles, a gadget for a programmer, in fact, because all these ‚Äúhalf a cup‚Äù, ‚Äúto taste‚Äù and ‚Äú125 milliliters in live weight‚Äù are another quest, and here the accuracy, speeding up the process and guaranteed result ); <br>  - <b>kitchen timer</b> (from 100 rubles). <br><br>  But the most important gadget in the production of salads - <a href="">Bosch MCM 5529</a> (5000-6000 rubles).  The feedback is mostly positive, moreover, it is practically the only ‚Äúgadget chopping into a cube‚Äù.  Can help you make Olivier in 7 minutes.  There are also meat grinders with the function of cutting cubes: <a href="">this</a> and <a href="">this</a> , but something reviews about them are not very. <br><br>  In general, the coolest recipe site, including salads - <a href="http://www.say7.info/cook/kitchen/38-Salatyi/">Say7</a> <br>  Everything is very detailed and popular, and most importantly - delicious. <br><br><h4>  Soups </h4><br>  Soup is the soul of dinner) I understand that the most delicious borscht is from mother or his girlfriend / wife, but during bachelorhood without ‚Äúliquid‚Äù is rather difficult, and for some reason, men generally do not understand well how to cook the first, but in vain.  There is nothing complicated. <br><br><h5>  The easiest vegetable soup. </h5><br>  Take the pan (liters to 2). <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Hidden text</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b29/76b/a41/b2976ba4198b9bdf83dd376f33c4dec3.jpg" alt="image"></div></div><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a2a/5a5/fb4/a2a5a5fb47e039e70a701cb091e21516.jpg" alt="image" align="right">  Fill 1.5 liters of water, bring to a boil, throw in diced potatoes (3-4 pieces), finely chopped carrots (1 small), small onions (you can just peel and throw whole, and then catch), close the lid.  Boil water - add vermicelli, or even any pasta, so that the bottom cover, cook for 10 minutes, pour seasonings and / or bay leaves, another couple of minutes (the main thing is to boil the potatoes, the criterion - poke it with a fork and freely pierce it).  Everything, the soup is ready. <br>  That is the essence - throw vegetables and wait. <br><br>  By the way, borsch is also prepared (no rocket science). <br><br><h5>  Borscht </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/dca/d15/23a/dcad1523a1e6e3efcfa60c1758348ce5.jpg" alt="image" align="right">  Onion finely crumbled (here will help the same chopper) <br>  Carrots grated or chopped <br>  Cabbage (100-150 grams) - cut into strips <br>  Beets (200 grams) - straws (can and chopper) <br>  Fry the onions and carrots in butter <br>  Potatoes (250 gr) - diced or cubes, put in boiling water (1.5 liters per 2 liter pan) <br>  Water boiled - threw cabbage, 5 waited - beets, waited 10 minutes - onions with carrots. <br>  Bay leaf one (do not need more!), Salt and pepper.  5 minutes more to boil (and you can already turn off the fire, if the potatoes are boiled) - ready. <br>  If you want to pozamorochitsya with meat broth, here is an excellent and detailed recipe from the same say7 - <a href="http://www.say7.info/cook/recipe/259-Borsch.html">www.say7.info/cook/recipe/259-Borsch.html</a> <br><br>  The fastest meat soup (I remember this phrase on some website) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ecb/75b/0f7/ecb75b0f74376222ebc7b854c4a37099.jpg" alt="image" align="right"><h5>  Meatball Soup </h5><br>  Cut three potatoes into cubes, 1 carrot finely - into boiling water.  While there is cooking, make meatballs. <br>  In a bowl, finely chop the onion, mix it with minced meat (200 grams), salt it, roll the balls between two hands) If you don‚Äôt sculpt or crawl, add 1 egg to the minced meat. <br>  Carefully toss the meatballs into the broth, as it boils - you can add noodles, cook for 7 minutes - the soup is ready!  You can also experiment with the seasonings and add them a couple of minutes before the expected readiness.  Well, in a plate of soup you can still crumble the greens. <br>  You can also simplify the task with a bag of frozen vegetables.  We fall asleep them, we wait when it boils - we throw the meatballs. <br><br><h4>  The second </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/250/03d/f6f/25003df6fe854db9eb7697055594b362.jpg" alt="image" align="right">  Here the most probably popular after dumplings "dish" - <b>pasta</b> .  Well, okay, you can only diversify them with different sauces (only good ones: dolmo, barilla, di checo, monin, unl benz).  Cooked pasta (in boiling water, 7-15 minutes, depending on the type, usually written on the packaging), poured onto a plate - poured with sauce.  You can also add grated cheese. <br><br>  If there is minced meat (left over from the soup with meatballs, yeah :)), then you can fry it in oil on all sides for about 7 minutes (turn over regularly), throw pasta into the pan, mix and fry a little (literally a couple of minutes).  You can also add tomato paste (a couple of tablespoons) and a pinch of seasoning. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2f0/c5c/9f9/2f0c5c9f9e4d0ec5d1e05a72ca34193c.jpg" alt="image" align="right">  In general, the <b>second of the meat</b> is prepared as follows: take chicken, pork, beef (fillet, tenderloin), my well, cut into pieces and fry in oil, turning over, when one side reddens, it takes about 20-40 minutes (more for beef, less for chicken). <br><br>  You can also simmer the meat, that is, add more water to the oil to cover the meat.  This is about an hour, sometimes even a half.  It is possible (and even necessary) to add sour cream, tomato paste, vegetables, and even fruit (oranges, for example). <br><br>  You can cook the meat (you will have soup broth and the second one) - this is about an hour and a half.  Here is an excellent resource, in order to find out how much time you need to cook <a href="http://www.timeboil.ru/meat/">www.timeboil.ru/meat</a> <br><br>  Well, you can steam it in a double boiler or a slow cooker, this will reduce cooking time by about 30-40%. <br><br><h4>  Garnish </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9db/c00/383/9dbc003837af132c674669ca139b5aae.jpg" alt="image" align="right">  The easiest option we have already considered - pasta. <br>  Do not lag behind them and porridge in bags such as these.  A lot of croup can be cooked like this: buckwheat, rice, wheat, barley, corn, millet).  In my opinion, I haven‚Äôt met anything like barley.  Actually the recipe is simple: boiled water, dipped the bag, added spices, noticed the time according to the manufacturer's recommendations - profit.  You can have a different side dish every day.  You can also experiment with different seasonings.  It will be like a new garnish taste every day. <br><br>  You can also prepare frozen vegetables from the bag: you heated the butter in a frying pan, threw the vegetables, fried them for 10 minutes, turning them over, <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f8c/322/c28/f8c322c28189a74938643da0bce41a2f.jpg" alt="image" align="right">  then poured water over sour cream, salt and pepper, lowered the heat and drained another 10 minutes under the lid closed. Done.  Instead of sour cream, you can add tomato paste. <br>  Well, traditional <b>potato</b> dishes <b>: boiled</b> (20-25 minutes), <b>roasted</b> (15 minutes) and mashed potatoes (cook, cut, to add warm milk or decoction of the same potato, oil and salt, quickly, crush) .  You can also make it in the microwave (cut into cubes, put in a glass bowl, pour sour cream and for 12-15 minutes at maximum power, you can add more cheese for another minute). <br><br><h4>  Dessert </h4><br>  This is generally aerobatics, but there are some simple recipes. <br>  First of all, <b>fruit salad</b> .  The recipe is simple - cut the fruit and mix) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4ba/bc8/de6/4babc8de674bb2d6f95208189939e47d.jpg" alt="image" align="right">  For example, bananas, kiwi, plums, tangerines, apples.  You can fill with yogurt or zafigachit piece of ice cream. <br><br>  Or, for example, <b>dessert "Frost</b> ".  Grind cookies in a blender or in the ceiling, nuts in a blender or in the ceiling, rub the chocolate bar on the grater.  Put ice cream in a bowl, then a layer of cookies, a layer of nuts and a layer of chocolate. <br><br>  And of course various sweet drinks are made very simply, for example, a <b>cocktail (or smoothie)</b> : ice cream (100 grams), milk (150 ml), 1 banana (or strawberry, orange, kiwi, peach, pineapple, fruit juice) mixed in a blender - done. <br><br>  Finally, you can make real <b>hot chocolate</b> for the evening <b>:</b> <br>  1 glass of milk diluted with 2-3 tablespoons (without top) of starch, the rest of the milk - in a saucepan over medium heat and throw the chocolate bar.  Chocolate dissolves - add milk with starch, interfere, heat until it starts to thicken - bon appetit! <br><br>  In general, cooking is actually a skill very close to programming (and sometimes more useful): there are resources and an algorithm. <br><pre><code class="delphi">program VkusnyiObed;
