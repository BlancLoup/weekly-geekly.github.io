I tried to write a book on WAP twice already - there was always a lack of motivation, I think if habrayusers are interested in this topic, then I will continue to write the book, I will tell you a lot of interesting things and motivation I will be above the roof ... well, it won‚Äôt be interesting ... well with her - the third pancake can also be a lump. :) <br><br>  So, I present the first chapter to the court of society. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Section 1. Chapter 1: The history of the development of WAP standards </h4><br>  WAP - stands for Wireless Application Protocol, which translated into Russian means "wireless access protocol." <br>  As you might think, WAP is just a data transfer protocol that allows you to access information from mobile devices, but this is far from the case.  WAP standards involve the use of certain technologies, and if the WAP data transfer protocol itself is now at the stage of clinical death, the standards that form WAP are only being improved.

      Three or four years ago, in our country, WAP was in the embryo stage, with the improvement of mobile devices, with the emergence of Mobile Phone Operators (and I will call them OpSoSami) of tariff plans that allow real use of mobile Internet, WAP received a big impetus to the development . <br>  Although lagging behind the west, WAP 1.x sites began to develop, although at this point it is worth stopping and talking in more detail. <br>  The fact is that the WAP 1.0 standard was published by the WAP Forum in 1998.  At that time, only the elite had cell phones, let alone the Internet on these same phones - until 2002, the Nokia 3310 remained the most popular phone in Russia. <br><br>  Version 1.1 was introduced in 1999, in the summer of 2000 the latest versions of the standard were published - 1.2 and 1.2.1. <br><br>  Consider the WAP 1.x standard in more detail: in fact, it is based on two languages: the WML markup language and the WMLScript scripting language, I think it is clear that WML was somewhat younger brother of HTML, and WMLScript was JavaScript.  However, WMLScript, at least in Russia, did not catch on, and nobody used the power of the WML language either.  The era of WAP 1.x in the CIS countries was at a time when monochrome devices, that is, until 2005, were the most common ‚Äúpipes‚Äù. <br><br>  In 2005, some sites began to implement a two-standard approach - users were asked to choose which standard to use - WAP 1.x or WAP 2.0. <br><br>  In our time, monochrome phones are more like a reminder of the past - take a look at your mobile phone! <br>  So, now the WAP 2.0 standard is dominant in WAP, which will be discussed later in the book. <br><br>  WAP 2.0 was published in 2002.  It replaces WML with a special version of xHTML - xHTML Mobile Profile, a striking innovation was the appearance of a stripped-down version of CSS - WAP CSS, which is based on the CSS2 standard, JavaScript, although not included in the standard, is supported by a large number of modern browsers. <br><br>  <b>PS</b> Anticipating what will happen: do not minus karma, but minus the topic :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/49394/">https://habr.com/ru/post/49394/</a></p>
