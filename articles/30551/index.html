Every day, a huge number of new sites are created to improve the lives of Internet users.  The creators pin great hopes on each of these sites: these are dreams of endless wealth and a stable future, the opportunity to gain invaluable experience in development and become a professional, the satisfaction of their ambitions. <br><br>  But to achieve these goals, it is necessary for a startup to be developed to be successful: attract users, interest them, become noticeable, and begin to make a profit. <br><br>  Unfortunately, most projects are doomed to extinction.  Someone calls it natural selection, but I want to approach it from the other side. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

    <h2>  The reason for the failure of projects lies in the wrong approach to their development. </h2><br>  Developers make a site for people.  Therefore, you need to devote the entire development process to the project to meet the needs of users. <br>  Here's what you need to make users like the startup: <br><ol><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/30551/">Good idea</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/30551/">Constant attention to usability</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/30551/">Elaborated entry page</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/30551/">Nice design</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/30551/">Minimum page load time</a> </li></ol><br><br>  It would seem nothing new.  But, looking at the huge number of unsuccessful projects, it is safe to say that not all developers are monitoring the fulfillment of these conditions. <br><br><h2>  Good idea </h2><br>  One of the most important factors for the success of the project being created is the idea.  A good idea can guarantee the interest in the project users.  Regardless of the implementation, if the idea is unique and relevant, it will be in demand.  At least until the moment when a competitor appears, offering a more user-friendly interface and more developed services. <br><br>  If the idea is not clear or interesting to the user, then it is likely that the site will not be able to attract a sufficient number of truly interested users.  And this in turn threatens the low profitability of the project, associated with the constantly high advertising costs to attract new visitors. <br><br>  The idea is formed and formalized at the stage of conceptual design of the project. <br><br>  From the point of view of developers, the idea should have the following features: <br><ol><li>  Interesting to a large number of users.  This will make it quite easy to collect the number of loyal users necessary for the life of the project </li><li>  Unique, i.e.  no direct competitors.  Making a second network about IT or a second video hosting site can be quite a daunting task, provided the competitors are comfortable and high quality (thus, ‚Äúdirect competitors‚Äù means user-friendly visited sites with the exact same idea) </li><li>  It has real ways to monetize.  In the case of banner advertising, this is a well-defined audience, in other cases, thoughtful options for monetization (paid services, affiliate programs, use of the user base) </li></ol><br>  When painting an idea, it is necessary to clarify the following points: <br><ol><li>  Objective of the project </li><li>  Project audience </li><li>  Basic use cases of users </li><li>  Project Functionality </li><li>  Ways to monetize the project </li></ol><br><h2>  Constant attention to usability </h2><br>  You need to constantly think about users and test the project at all stages of development. <br><br>  To be sure of the convenience of the project for the user, you must fulfill the following requirements: <br><ol><li>  Detailed design of the project at the planning stage (conceptual, logical design, creation of a prototype system and its usability testing) </li><li>  Perform prototyping and optimization of interface elements during project implementation </li><li>  Check the usability of the project being created at all stages of its life (conduct usability testing, and use other methods for a more comprehensive assessment of usability) </li></ol><br><h2>  Elaborated entry page </h2><br>  Once on the entrance page, the user must immediately understand what opportunities the site offers him.  If the goal of the project remains unclear on the entrance page, then most likely the user will simply not deal with the project, but will proceed to search for another site. <br><br>  The start page should contain the following: <br><ul><li>  Purpose and purpose of the site </li><li>  Site hierarchy </li><li>  Search </li><li>  Content review (‚ÄúContent Promos‚Äù) talks about the latest, best and most popular content elements, such as the latest articles or great deals. </li><li>  An overview of services ("Feature promos") invites the user to visit additional sections of the site and use some services, such as personalization or subscription to newsletters. </li><li>  Periodically updated content </li><li>  Shortcuts.  Site content elements that are most frequently requested by visitors (for example, updated versions of software) deserve to have links to get to them quickly on the start page. </li><li>  Check in.  If registration is used on the site, then special links for new visitors and for those who have already registered should be placed on the start page.  There should also be signs indicating that you are a registered user. </li></ul><br>  In addition, the homepage should serve several common goals: <br><ul><li>  Show me what I'm looking for.  The start page should clearly show how to get what I need - provided that it is generally on the site. </li><li>  ... and what I'm not looking for.  At the same time, the start page should tell me that there are some other things on this site that might interest me, despite the fact that I'm not looking for them at the moment. </li><li>  Show me the place to start.  There is nothing worse than coming across a start page where you cannot understand where the beginning </li><li>  Cause trust in the site.  In some cases, the start page may be the only chance to make a favorable impression on a site visitor. </li></ul><br><h2>  Nice design </h2><br>  One of the laws of usability says: "Visually attractive objects seem more comfortable."  You need to carefully consider the design development so that it will be liked and remembered by the target audience. <br><br><h2>  Minimum page load time </h2><br>  Despite the high speed and low Internet tariffs in the central regions, the regions still have problems with the Internet.  Therefore, it is unacceptable to have low page loading speed for users. <br><br>  In addition, web 2.0 applications are for the most part high-powered and non-optimized applications can lead to the fact that the servers will no longer cope with the number of visitors that the site will have. <br><br><h2>  One more thing </h2><br>  There is another problem affecting usability and perception of projects.  Sometimes, according to investors, in order to perform business tasks, it is necessary to go to the detriment of usability.  In fact, it is necessary to remember that the success of the project is described by its audience, so it is necessary, nevertheless, to first of all think about the convenience of users.  And if the business model is contrary to the convenience of users, then perhaps it is worth revising the model. <br><br><h2>  findings </h2><br>  When developing a startup of your dream, please think about those users who will work with it.  After all, in the end, only thanks to them your work will not pass in vain.  Try to please them not only with your brilliant idea, but also with a magnificent performance.  Be professional. <br><br>  A little more in the <a href="http://blog.htc-cs.ru/post/2008-07-30-kak-sozdat-pravilniy-startap.aspx">original source</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/30551/">https://habr.com/ru/post/30551/</a></p>
