In peak values, this figure has already been achieved several times, but now it is fixed by recalculating the complexity that occurred on February 7. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Secondly, the last recalculation of complexity turned out to be remarkable by the fact that for the first time in a long time a one-time increase exceeded 20% - quite a bit, but this turned out to be enough to achieve the sign mark.  February 7, the complexity increased by 20.06%.  Such a sharp jump in the history of Bitcoin has not yet been.  So what happened to the hashrate and what follows from this?

      A hashrate is the collective computing power of computers that support the Bitcoin network.  Only on December 31 of last year, the bitcoin hashrate was 743,604,444 GH / s, and at the time of this writing, the bitcoin computational power is 1,260,403,040 GH / s.  <a href="https://bitcoinwisdom.com/bitcoin/difficulty">bitcoinwisdom.com/bitcoin/difficulty</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a3a/c4f/01e/a3ac4f01ee86d747870084fe229d6166.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The more miners involved in the search, the higher the hashrate and, accordingly, the greater the complexity of mining.  Mining complexity is a measure of the characterization of the difficulty of finding hashes that match the network criteria.  The complexity changes after every 2016 new blocks - approximately every two weeks.  At the moment, the complexity of mining is 144,116,447,847 and is growing at approximately the same pace as the hashrate. <br><br>  Over the history of Bitcoin, hash rate has grown to colossal performance.  For the stability of the network, the growth of computing power plays a fundamental role, however, in parallel with it, the miner‚Äôs task becomes more and more complex. <br><br>  Earlier this year, the cost of Bitcoin fell below $ 300.  It seemed to many that this would be enough for a certain number of miners to turn off their devices, finding the mining impractical. <br><br>  However, the data for the last few months speaks about the reverse trend: the computing power of the network <a href="http://bitscan.com/articles/what-just-happened-to-hashrate">doubled</a> compared with the data for July last year, sharply accelerating growth in the last weeks of last year, continuing the trend at the beginning of this year. <br><br>  There are several possible explanations for the resurgent interest in mining Bitcoins.  The first and most obvious is the rise in the cost of Bitcoin at the end of last year after a long rollback, which affected the miners' earnings. <br><br>  The second explanation is related to the activities of <a href="http://bitfury.com/">BitFury</a> , which has released a new generation of super-efficient mining chips and opened its own huge data center in Georgia.  In January 2016, Bitfury launched a massive production of chips developed using a 16 nm process technology, and its Chinese competitors compensate for the technical achievements of an opponent by mass production of optimized 28 nm chips.  In addition, the Swedish company KnC Miner <a href="https://forum.bits.media/index.php%3F/topic/13922-kncminer-zapuskaet-16nm-bitcoin-asic-novogo-pokoleniia/">also masters 16 nm.</a> <br><br>  In addition, the reduction of the mining award by half is inevitably approaching, after which the remuneration for each found block will decrease from 25 BTC to 12.5 BTC.  It is possible that many tend to catch up to the maximum before the fatal hour, however, if the hash rate continues to grow at the same pace, the new blocks will be detected faster and faster, which will accelerate the halving. <br><br>  If you also participate in the general trend, our blog reminds you that it is not necessary to climb into the mine, you can mine Bitcoins in the cloud, with the cloud mining service <a href="https://hashflare.io/%3Flang%3Drus%26utm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3D271180">HashFlare</a> . <br><br> <a href="https://hashflare.io/%3Flang%3Drus%26utm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3D271180"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eb1/57f/5f9/eb157f5f90f54032aa2b80b1c2973a73.png" alt="image"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/390663/">https://habr.com/ru/post/390663/</a></p>
