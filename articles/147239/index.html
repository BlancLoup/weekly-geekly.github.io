  <section class="page js-page"><h1>10 rules that will help the application to receive a recommendation from Google Play</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today, over 600,000 applications are available on the Android platform, in which it is very easy to get lost.  One of the most reliable ways to stimulate downloads is to get the ‚ÄúEditor‚Äôs Choice‚Äù title on Google Play, but the company hasn‚Äôt yet explained what principles it guides to determine whether an application is suitable for receiving this recommendation. <br><br>  At the Google I / O conference last week, protectors of all developers Dan Galpin and Ian Lewis suggested several steps to Android developers, following which they can increase the chances of their application to get on the Google Play list. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/75d/ce2/329/75dce2329f7b79e3c54c94c4098ab97b.png"><a name="habracut"></a>

        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

      First of all, developers need to endow their application with high resolution support.  Those.  It should work at least in 720p resolution.  Lewis and Galpin also advised not to use Compatibility Mode in the Honeycomb version, since the increased graphics do not look so clear. <br><br>  It is also not necessary to change or delete the ‚Äúnative‚Äù Android buttons from the screen.  Sometimes the brightness of these buttons is reduced so that they can become almost invisible right during the game.  Instead, developers should follow the principle of minimal intervention.  An example is the Back button, which, when clicked on during the gameplay, should pause the game.  Further, developers can give this button the ability to display options or move a player to the previous screen, while pressing it on the main game screen should turn it off. <br><br>  Developers also need to make the application provide a ‚Äúpainless‚Äù user experience.  This includes, for example, ‚Äúrespect for the user's lifestyle‚Äù, i.e.  an application, for example, should not turn on and play a sound, even when the device is locked.  Instead, games should stop playing the sound immediately after the user pauses them, and should not resume playing until the user returns to the application.  Applications must require minimum permissions.  They are unlikely to fall into the list of recommended on Google Play if, for example, they change wi-fi settings, change / read information from contacts and calendars, send and send SMS messages, etc. <br><br>  The application must be reliable.  The easiest way to achieve reliability is, as Galpin and Lewis said, testing applications on <a href="http://apps4all.ru/news/google/fragmentatsiya-android-3997-razlichnyih-ustroystv.html">as</a> many Android devices <a href="http://apps4all.ru/news/google/fragmentatsiya-android-3997-razlichnyih-ustroystv.html">as possible</a> , since the graphics processors on different models are different, and different drivers can often cause crashes.  Reliability is also important for making in-app payments.  Often, applications do not track purchases and do not deliver content for which the user paid - such applications will not be recommended. <br><br>  Finally, Galpin and Lewis advised developers who have already created a high-quality game to translate it into as many languages ‚Äã‚Äãas possible in order to increase the potential user base.  If the company does not have the resources to translate the game into several languages, you should focus on English and Korean, as Korean Android users are especially fond of platform games. <br><br>  And here are three easy ways to make the application NOT appear in the list of recommended on Google Play.  First, use any other provider besides Google to make payments.  Secondly, allow the application to download other applications.  As Galpin said, ‚ÄúGoogle Play is not the place to distribute your own app store.‚Äù  Third, to bribe players with in-game rewards so that they write positive revaluations.  Such an approach is considered the most terrible violation by the editors of the store, and a game that does this will never receive a recommendation.  Of course, developers can ask users to leave their feedback, you just can not create conditions that require positive ratings from players. <br><br>  Galpin and Lewis said that their advice is by no means a certain set of rules, but it‚Äôs exactly the criteria that they described that Google editors use when evaluating applications. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/147239/">https://habr.com/ru/post/147239/</a></p>
