If someone 6 months ago told me that I would be writing an article on the Win-Dophone blog, I would probably update the baseband of his locked iPhone.  But, the fate of prankish disposed of me in such a way that today I will try to please you a little with light reading on this particular subject. <br><br>  Around the end of October, a good friend of mine suggested that I take part in testing a simple program that he was developing in his free time.  The problem was that the program was written under Windows Phone 7, and I myself - not so much as an Apple evangelist, but a very accustomed creation to my iPhone, and, consequently, the prospect of separation from it and sharing it for the hellish machines unknown to me developed in the catacombs of Redmond did not seem to me to be so rosy.  However, it was too late to refuse (and somehow uncomfortable), and for the following weeks I put aside my apple machine by adopting the WinPh7 counterpart.  So that my efforts are not wasted in vain, I decided to acquaint you with what I had to test.  You might even be interested.  Welcome under the category‚Ä¶ <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      The concept of the application itself seemed to me very interesting, since I did not see any analogs on my own device, and the functionality seemed to me to be very popular.  As a reference lemming and a network hamster, 95% of my activity on the network via mobile devices consists in reading cozy blzhek, reports on how someone had eaten - on Twitter, checking emails and their similar activities.  Probably for these reasons, I sacrificed stability and comfort for Iria.  The version that was put at my disposal was a kind of draft that should allow me to evaluate the overall ergonomics and the relevance of the application.  Originally stated to me as an RSS / HTML client, this thing, exclusively in my humble opinion, has great potential for further development. <br><br><img src="http://img824.imageshack.us/img824/8136/92292351.png" alt="image"><br><br>  About such standard and obvious features haraknernye for many applications for WinPhone7, such as feeds that are rendered on the desktop, the use of "live taytlov" in order to indicate the number of unread news / messages and other-other-other - I remember with your permission, I will not.  First of all, I want to start saving my traffic, which is actually characteristic of such programs.  But, as I was later explained, Iria uploads news not directly from resources, subscriptions to which were issued, but from its own server, where they are carefully flown, compressed, compacted, and through the nano-channels are in the form of letters on the device screen.  Not less than I was pleased with the ability to import subscriptions from a Google reader, which greatly simplified the initial spin-up "for yourself." <br><br>  Other advantages of this miracle over the usual surfing of a blozhekam include Postamt filters, mercilessly devouring advertising.  Especially useful for me, an amateur to read on the subway, was the auto-download function of news from selected sources with an internet connection, which may have deprived me of the last chance to meet the love of all life in metro cars, but allowed me to read fresh posts on Habr√© without having network connectivity. <br><br><img src="http://img72.imageshack.us/img72/769/99888683.png" alt="image"><br><br>  In general, this little thing allowed me to take a fresh look at my attitude to Windevice.  Perhaps, under other conditions, I would never try to delve into the pros and cons of using the whole of the windows in a very pleasant OS.  Of course, I still have a few minor complaints about the program itself (the designer and other nishtyachki are a little bit coarse in places, which you get used to after using the iPhone for a long time), but they are completely covered by its advantages.  In the foreseeable future, the author promised to polish the nuances and add new functionality, which I look forward to. <br><br><h3>  By the way, you can familiarize yourself with the program by downloading it <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/ru-RU/apps/21673922-1bf7-4921-9fa0-d81c51cf3af1">from here</a> .  Free of charge, or by paying the creator a symbolic amount.  How much - decide for yourself. </h3><br>  Personally, for example, I have long wanted to have a certain combine that will allow you to create your own feeds from posts on blogs, LiveJournal, updates on Twitter, Facebook and ‚Äúwebsite_ on_which_nikto_is_habrol√ºde__registered‚Äù.  In the end, it would be just convenient!  For the time being, Iria has come closest to this ultimate goal.  And, for example, I very much hope that circumstances will not allow the author to abandon his wonderful venture. <br><br>  Here is some kind of ambiguous and downed, I got a post. <br>  I hope you were at least a little interesting. <br>  Sincerely, Sanbeliver. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/134789/">https://habr.com/ru/post/134789/</a></p>
