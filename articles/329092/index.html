We want to get rid of disappointments and set an example of how to telephone your office of any size: connect a cloud PBX, and even link the telephony to a free CRM system and spend 300-500 rubles per month for everything.  By the way, a stick of smoked sausage for such money is very difficult to find. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h3>  Once again about cloud PBX </h3><br>  Let's quickly run through the theory.  Cloud PBX is an alternative to a physical office telephone exchange, that is, the operator has the necessary equipment, and the client receives all services via the Internet.  Surprisingly, in its capabilities, the virtual PBX is not inferior to the hardware, everything is close by and configured in minutes.  We explain the work of PBX through a simple scheme.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/262/b0c/1ed/262b0c1ed9344bdca908458928169132.png"><br><br><h3>  We configure PBX </h3><br>  If we are talking about sausage, then take the example of a small Ryazan farm. <br>  So, the head of the Ryazan farm, Maxim Krasnov, at the first stages of the business decided to deal with setting up the cloud PBX Zadarma personally.  He registered on the site and bought a direct phone <a href="https://zadarma.com/ru/tariffs/numbers/russian-federation/ryazan/">number in Ryazan</a> , after that he described the telephony task and began to configure the <a href="https://zadarma.com/ru/support/instructions/pbx/">PBX</a> .  The task is to create internal numbers (for him, an accountant, a technologist and a secretary), add a voice menu, set up call scripts, receive calls only during working hours. <br><br>  In his personal account, Maxim turned on the PBX and went to the setup wizard. <br><br><ul><li>  Creating internal PBX numbers - For the task, Maxim needs four internal numbers, 101 for him, 102 for an accountant, 103 for a technologist, 104 answering machine for non-working time. <br><br></li><li>  The voice greeting menu (the greeting can be typed with text, or it can be loaded with an audio file, Maxim did not waste time and just typed the letters in the required line, the system read the text itself. ‚ÄúHello, you are welcomed by the livestock farm. On partnership and wholesale issues Press the button 1, to contact the financial department, press the button 2, to contact the department of production technology, press 3 ‚Äù. <br><br></li><li>  Incoming Call Processing Scenarios - In this section, you can create items that are used in the voice menu.  Maxim chooses the necessary scenarios: Without pressing - secretary, Button 1 - Maxim Krasnov, Button 2 - Accounting Department, Button 3 - Chief Technologist of the Farm). <br><br></li><li>  Setting up incoming calls - At this point, Maxim directly sets the scenarios themselves - which extensions will receive calls, and in what order.  For example, if he does not take the phone within 15 seconds, the call is transferred to the secretary. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/a1c/71d/0b6/a1c71d0b63f5411ea1e0ce1b54501a5c.png"><br><br>  At this stage, the PBX setup was successfully completed (Maxim took 8 minutes for the first setup of the Zadarma PBX).  In order for the purchased Ryazan phone number to be displayed at the subscriber, you need to set the Ryazan number as CallerID.  CallerID is the number that is determined when you call.  Since the Ryazan number is the first one that Maxim bought and did not confirm others, it was automatically established as CallerID.  Then CallerID can be changed in the PBX settings, choosing from the purchased / confirmed numbers. <br><br>  Calls come to each IP-phone on IP-phones, while Max himself receives calls on his mobile through the application, as he is always on the road and out of the office.  If suddenly he is out of the Internet, the call is forwarded to his mobile number (conditional forwarding is configured in the section My PBX-internal numbers) <br><br><h3>  Moscow representative office </h3><br>  At the beginning of 2017, Maxim‚Äôs business went uphill, the production volume increased and the farm discovered new horizons for itself - decided to open a Moscow office, only opening a physical office in the early stages turned out to be costly.  The farm found an experienced employee with a car, added the phrase ‚ÄúRepresentation in Moscow‚Äù and a phone number to the main site.  Now you can call directly to the Moscow ‚Äúoffice‚Äù or ask your Ryazan colleagues to switch.  The manager receives calls from home or on the road directly to his mobile, and distributors and future partners do not see any trick (what difference does it make).  In addition, in order not to store customer and partner data on an Excel tablet, a business decides to go completely to a serious level and acquire a CRM system. <br><br>  For the new task, Maxim connects the <a href="https://zadarma.com/ru/tariffs/numbers/russian-federation/moscow/direction-1923/">Moscow number</a> , and expands the scenarios created earlier.  Now, in order to reach the Moscow manager in the voice menu, you need to press the button 5. Moreover, on the website you can find the direct Moscow number by which the manager in Moscow will receive the call directly. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/5fa/e85/dd3/5fae85dd32ca4552821f1e38e151e122.png"><br><br>  Having two different offices, you can bind two different voice menus to each telephone number and set up the calendar of offices in a virtual PBX in different ways.  So does Maxim, because his Moscow sales office is 9 hours a day (from 10 am to 7 pm), while the Ryazan farm works and receives calls from 7 am to 5 pm. <br><br><h3>  CRM Integration </h3><br>  The phrase "Integration with the CRM-system" scares only beginners.  A bunch of cloud PBX with the CRM system occurs by pressing two (exactly) buttons.  Maxim decides not to postpone the case indefinitely and chooses a CRM system to suit his needs (Maxim chose the free version of <a href="https://zadarma.com/ru/support/instructions/crm_bitrix/">Bitrix 24</a> for review).  As a result, the integration of PBX with CRM solves many problems - the Moscow manager calls from CRM in one click, when the client calls for the first time, the system creates a card of this client, and Maxim sees not only the full statistics of calls, but can also listen to all conversations directly from CRM system. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/64e/84d/cb4/64e84dcb48f647519344867de4db1525.png"><br><br><h3>  Budgets </h3><br>  As a result, we consider budgets for telephony in the Ryazan farm - subscription fees for two numbers - 330 rubles per month (120 rubles a room in Moscow and 210 rubles a number in Ryazan).  The outgoing connection is used primarily by the manager in Moscow, on average, he slanders 100 outgoing minutes to fixed numbers in Moscow and 70 minutes to mobile numbers in the regions.  Maxim chose the standard tariff plan, which includes free 100 minutes to fixed numbers in Moscow.  Tariffication is by the way per second.  As a result, 70 minutes to mobile = 140 rubles (the cost of a minute to mobile Russian numbers at the Standard tariff is 1.98 rubles, but in general any call in Russia will cost no more than 2 rubles per minute). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/631/deb/acf/631debacfd6045519af70793913c0f37.png"><br><br>  We get = 330 + 140. For <u>470 rubles a month</u> Ryazan farm (once again we note that the company is Ryazan, and coverage is Russian) solved the telephone question in the company and most importantly - it does not care about the quality of communication, support equipment and does not spend on the administrator, who is following everything.  Plus, at any time, the farm can expand its geography (even to enter the world market) and this will not get into a lot of money. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/329092/">https://habr.com/ru/post/329092/</a></p>
