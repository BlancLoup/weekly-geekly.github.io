It so happened that our first application went to the market to conquer this particular category, and I believe that we managed to correct the situation. <br>  For us, frankly, it remains unknown what exactly inspired us to create such an application, because there were quite a few lovers of mosaic in the company, and many puzzles of a similar type were assembled.  Although our team is firmly convinced that it was <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/stretch-the-puzzle/id474161723">our Stretch the Puzzle that</a> turned out to be unique and cool! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><table><tbody><tr><td><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/ec461470/5e33c3cb/a8041af3/107a8ea2.jpg"></td><td><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/a948456e/1c720133/a173fdd4/43b6f806.jpg"></td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/4dbc93e7/81650ad6/f7ada5c0/ac51f6d5.jpg"></td><td><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/b6322bf5/c1035645/e4c56620/626e660d.jpg"></td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/b4be9f76/af9692a1/2a9bf5d5/1c3f5650.jpg"></td><td><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/2ebaee6d/899d5987/069a2562/0671b502.jpg"></td></tr></tbody></table><br><h4>  Development </h4><br>  It is difficult to say something about the development itself, because the technical project and implementation could be imagined from the very start.  Some difficulties have arisen only in connecting all sorts of buns, in the spirit of the game center (it was left for the next update), facebook and twitter. <br>  Could not help flash the thought of screwing the ability to freely load their pictures and saw them on new puzzles, but having thought over all the pros and cons, we decided not to weigh the game and move the creation of our mosaics to the supplement. <br>  Development was carried out on Unity3d. <br><br><h4>  Preparation of materials </h4><br>  I decided to give it a separate item, because we really took pictures for the site for a long time, because we did release a commercial application, and about rights, owners and closed applications was already a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/macosxdev/102112/">separate topic</a> on Habr√©.  Therefore, we carefully smoked the manuals and read the placement conditions from each source, so as not to debug anywhere. <br>  Then we decided on several sites and quickly gathered a collection for the game and for the upcoming additions. <br>  All collected images were taken under the following licenses: CC-BY, CC-BY-SA, CC-BY-ND.  I will say right away: the main resource has become <a href="http://flickr.com/">Flickr</a> .  Fortunately, there is a search for a certain type of license and a huge collection of images.

    <h4>  Registration </h4><br>  A small feature of the design turned out that there were no artifacts that had dropped out of work.  From the very beginning, the artist lingered a little with the choice of style, selecting the one that was closer to him - but then he caught up with the deadlines, without burning up valuable man-hours for extra work. <br>  Here are the rough sketches of the interfaces that were successfully rejected: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/2574baa1/9f1bd7df/d142f51b/e91b1a7f.png"><br><br>  As a result, agreed on a paper-cardboard version as the most attractive. <br><br><h4>  Publication </h4><br>  From the first, as they say, did not take off.  Downloading the file to the app, we waited a few minutes in a row and saw the inscription Invalid Binary.  Of course, the formulation of the error did not commit it to anything. <br>  However, Major General Google quickly <a href="http%253A%252F%252Fstackoverflow.com%252Fquestions%252F6269002%252Fapp-submission-error-invalid-binary-invalid-code-signing-error%26sa%3DD%26sntz%3D1%26usg%3DAFQjCNH6MesD1sZUsPngXztj3hTrVvP7BQ">clarified</a> that in order to prevent this error, you need to disable the akylaud checkbox in the profile settings. <br><br><h4>  Test users </h4><br>  What inspired us great is the first tests.  People sat behind the game with the words "well, oh ... I do not really like to collect a mosaic ...", and came off from it after an indefinite period, usually from forty minutes to an hour and a half. <br><br><h4>  Results </h4><br>  At the moment there are no results at all.  The game is gradually being sold, there was a small problem at the time of confirmation of the release, in connection with which we were published yesterday, and we strongly moved down the list.  So at the moment we are still waiting for the results to add something in this paragraph. <br><br>  Official trailer: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/uqM3IUZpnsY%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjxyheFvrDc6KIGSiUAV0pWTdas-w" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Here is the gameplay video: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/mteXdeRacmE%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgkis-iuEUB-qipEczWB9ftT55s5g" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Thanks for attention. <br><br>  <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/stretch-the-puzzle/id474161723">iTunes App Store</a> <br><br>  Promotional codes: <br>  <s>YLKAE677HKX7</s> <s><br></s>  <s>FEXFTL9WWPKK</s> <s><br></s>  <s>PYET6LLPT6F3</s> <br><br>  PS We are currently preparing an update for Christmas, wait for more promotional codes.
