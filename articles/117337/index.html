      So, I decided to spend no more evening to get the desired result.  I have a sony erricson k810i <strong>tele</strong> von on my hands with a sim card from Megafon-Northwest, I don‚Äôt have my own servers <s>even on a router</s> and I want everything to work without cash.  There are several obvious solutions. <br><br><h2>  "The future depends on you."  Timeout. </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/b5f12667/66e758d3/13a18a0b/3f0c0d97.jpg" align="right"><br>  As in the implementation of the desired can help the operator.  From the site you can send free sms.  There is even an <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/image_processing/116222/">opinion</a> that captcha is not a problem.  But for this you need to write code, post it on the Internet and ... in the evening you can not make it, go ahead. <br><br>  You can search for the service of the mail gateway with SMS notification.  All the same, 2011 is in the yard.  The wonderful MegaFon Mail service is, and even free, and the expanded paid for 2 r a day.  Time to test the free option.  The restriction on the reception of letters only from senders in the domain megafon.mobi (not such a terrible restriction, if properly sent the letter) and the restriction of the size of the box to 5 MB can interfere.  We follow the link to the service page, the page drops through one transition even in the opera, with the Wap emulator, but the eyes are afraid and the hands are doing and now everything is set up and even the conditions of the service are read. <br><br>  We send a letter and start the countdown to receive sms ... It is already quite dark outside the window, and I want to eat. <br><br>  While we wait, let's see if there is a cherished setting in the mailbox. <br><br><h2>  "Letter for you".  Failed. </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/aa995e9b/97d323b2/f95844ae/0fd3f753.jpg" align="right"><br>  I use gmail, hotmail and rambler mail. <br><ul><li>  gmail - Failed. </li><li>  hotmail - Failed. </li><li>  rambler - Failed. </li></ul><br>  And there is no sms, so ... <br><ul><li>  yandex - Failed. </li><li>  mail - Accepted. </li></ul><br><br><h2>  ‚ÄúFoo, mail.  Wow, mail!  Accepted. </h2><br>  Honestly, I registered on mail.ru for the peace of conscience.  Under the influence of many articles, some correct comments and personal memories of the spam that my mailbox turned into a couple of years ago, the reputation of this resource in my rating has been greatly shaken, but this IMHO is wildly subjective and generally irrelevant. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/55fa243a/eb4b6c14/6684f637/8c4e7952.png" align="right"><br>  In the settings you can find the service "sms-notifications" with the mark "new".  We connect it by specifying the number and confirming it with the code from the SMS, configure additional parameters.  By the way, I want to mention the option of timing the arrival of sms-notifications as very relevant.  No to sms at night!  Sms with a confirmation code reached in about an hour, and messages about a new letter reach within a minute, unless other settings are specified. <br><br><h2>  Instead of a conclusion.  Printing context results. </h2><br>  Mail.ru really pleased me.  Service works and works quickly.  Anonymus in me doesn‚Äôt want to talk to me anymore due to the fact that I took it like that and pointed out my phone to someone.  I sincerely believe that mail.ru will fulfill its obligations to ensure the privacy of my data and will not create worlds for me.  God complex I do not suffer.  Sms from Megafon came to me all the same, but according to the law ‚Äúon the least resistance ...‚Äù the choice has already been made. <br><br>  Surely there should be more sites of services specifically created for the provision of various sms-notification services.  I also saw an offer to take a phone, connect it to a computer, get control over the internal commands of the phone's operating system and send sms from it, and execute commands on the computer through received sms. <br><br>  Do not forget about filters, otherwise the mood of happiness will quickly be replaced by irritation.  I have about 10 mailboxes divided by areas of life.  For example, your litter box, everything related to my work, for correspondence, etc.  That is why letters from ‚Äúwork‚Äù and ‚Äúpersonal correspondence‚Äù are redirected to mail.ru mailbox. <br><br>  That's all.  Timely mail to you. <br><br>  PS Thanks to Habr's users who helped publish. <br>  PSS Not sure I chose the right blog. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/117337/">https://habr.com/ru/post/117337/</a></p>
