If you are interested in drones, copters and other aircraft, as well as if you are ready to share your Telegram informants on this topic, welcome to Cat. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Sad as it may seem, the fact is that drones, drones and other quadrocopters did not live up to the expectations placed on them, did not become as popular as cameras, smart phones, smart watches or fintnes bracelets.  The lack of information and the ‚Äúconsistency‚Äù of groups of amateur and professional unmanned business played a minor role in this.  This publication was planned as a list of Telegram-resources, and turned into a call for help in their collection.  Despite the existing opinion that drones are a very promising topic, there is little information about this perspective.  Telegram Messenger is no exception.  And now the little that was found in alphabetical order. <br><br><h3>  Bots </h3><br>  <a href="https://t.me/hnrobot">@hnrobot</a> - <b>HackerNews Robot</b> . <br>  I recommend starting with him.  Simple settings and keywords 'drone', 'UAV', 'copter' allow you to be aware of the most noticeable unmanned events. <br><br><h3>  Drone channels </h3><br>  <a href="https://t.me/dronenews">@dronenews</a> - <b>Drone news</b> <br>  News of the world of unmanned aerial vehicles.  Channel about the drones of all stripes, excluding unmanned vehicles.  It has a weakness for flying machines with crazy people inside, they are also essentially drones.

More complete information is always available in the <a href="https://vk.com/fpvdudes">group</a> .  Channel command FPVDudes.  If you have not seen Haka Maori in their performance, it's time to fill the gap. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A2rTbpKZFSM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h3>  Channels about drones including </h3><br>  <a href="https://t.me/nplusone">@nplusone</a> - <b>Nplus1</b> . <br>  <i>The main Russian edition of science and technology</i> <br>  The regular appearance of articles of unmanned subjects in the characteristic N + 1 style.  The most noticeable events they usually do not miss.  But it can strain a large number of publications per day. <br><br>  <a href="https://t.me/robotbro">@robotbro</a> - <b>RobotBro |</b>  <b>RobotBro</b> <br>  <i>Latest Robotics News</i> <br>  The creator of the channel believes that the drones are close relatives of robots. <br><br>  <a href="https://t.me/robotics_channel">@robotics_channel</a> - <b>Robotics Channel</b> <br>  <i>The world of robotics, artificial intelligence and their applications.</i> <br>  Another channel about robotics, waterfowl and airborne UAVs and that‚Äôs all. <br><br><h3>  Chats </h3><br>  Before the list of chat requires a small non-literary retreat.  Most members of drone teams have very real experience in creating and using them.  Once again, to hear "I decided to join the number of owners of quadcopters and ..." is akin to "this is my first publication on Habr√©, and therefore please treat it ...".  You will be answered with a well-formulated question, will help to deal with a specific problem and will give practical advice before using a new technology.  But do not expect that with the help of the chat you can set up a conditional octa from APM from scratch or choose a champion quadric configuration.  We'll have to learn a lot and experience for yourself. <br><br>  <a href="https://t.me/DJI_Celgus">@DJI_Celgus</a> - <a href="https://t.me/DJI_Celgus">Quadcopters</a> . <br>  <i>Specially created group for all owners of quadcopters.</i>  <i>Here you can ask / assist, evaluate the work of others and just chat with other people who are also interested in drones!</i> <br>  Chat is activated with the onset of flight weather and slows down during periods of prolonged absence.  Recently began to "thaw".  Its members include owners of copters and shops selling them. <br><br>  <a href="https://t.me/drones_ru">@drones_ru</a> - <b>Copters</b> : <br>  <i>Chat.</i>  <i>This group is for owners of copters.</i>  <i>Advice and mutual assistance.</i> <br>  Similar to the previous chat, both in meaning and in population.  If you choose from two, then I would recommend both. <br><br>  <a href="https://t.me/onlydroneparts">@onlydroneparts</a> - <b>DRON IRON ONLY</b> <br>  <i>The most tightly moderated chat about equipment for drones and races.</i>  <i>Without mat and flooding.</i>  <i>For violation - a warning.</i>  <i>For a warning - a ban for 3 days</i> <br><br>  <a href="https://t.me/onlydroneracing">@onlydroneracing</a> - <a href="https://t.me/onlydroneracing">DRONG RACING</a> <b>ONLY</b> <br>  <i>The most tightly moderated chat about drone racing.</i>  <i>ONLY race questions are discussed.</i>  <i>Without mat and flooding.</i>  <i>For violation - a warning.</i>  <i>Behind the warning - ban 3 days</i> <br><br>  <a href="https://t.me/quadrocoptery">@quadrocoptery</a> - <b>QUADROCOPTERS</b> <br>  <i>Chat group vk.com/quadrocoptery</i> <br>  A more active community, but it seemed to me that in order to fully use it, it‚Äôs worth it to visit the VKontakte group. <br><br>  <a href="https://t.me/racingdronemarket">@racingdronemarket</a> - <b>Flea market.</b>  <b>Only announcements</b> <br>  <i>Flea market drone racer.</i>  <i>We place the goods, price, description, photo.</i>  <i>Details of the transaction in PM.</i>  <i>For flood - ban for 3 days</i> <br><br>  <a href="https://t.me/RCmodels">@RCmodels</a> - <b>RC cars airplanes</b> <br>  <i>All about modeling and radio model</i> <br>  The group was positioned as a modeling community, but was secretly captured by the copter.  Evil tongues say that soon the mark of one of them will appear in the name of the chat. <br><br>  Now about the state of the drone-telegram and the selection of resources for this publication.  Unfortunately, there are a lot of abandoned channels on the subject of UAVs in Telegram.  And if the relative lull in chat rooms can be explained by the fact that fewer questions arise in the offseason, then this cannot be said about the news.  Infopovody arise with enviable regularity.  Probably the creators of the channels wanted to ride a popular topic and were faced with the fact that the channel about any other technology is developing much more actively than about drones. <br><br>  Unmanned chats are mostly non-public.  You can get into them only by invitation links or with the help of administrators.  But even the number of supergroups does not exceed one and a half hundred members.  Once again I remind you that you should not enter the chat and demand exclusive attention to yourself.  The complete absence of presentations on the topic of communication will not find understanding among experienced unmanned pilots.  An exception can be made for an account with a pretty female avatar, but this is a completely different movie. <br><br>  If you drive or know interesting TG resources on the subject of UAVs, please report them.  When the list reaches an impressive size, it will be given a special place in these of our Internet. <br><br>  Clear sky.  Do not fly. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/370379/">https://habr.com/ru/post/370379/</a></p>
