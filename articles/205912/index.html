  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Mr. Handy - Sony SmartWatch 2 Review</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  2013 can be called the year of smart watches.  From exotic toys for geeks, they gradually become a completely everyday phenomenon, at the same time acquiring an elegant appearance.  Over the past few months, quite a few devices of this class have appeared on the market, including an updated version of SmartWatch from Sony, which is a pioneer in this field and introduced its first smart watch back in 2006.  We offer you a review of this wonderful gadget. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8c5/843/16d/8c584316d4bc5cd657189ac2e8dc3e81.jpg"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      <b>General impressions</b> <br><br>  Immediately, I note that SmartWatch is not a self-operating device, but rather a remote control for a smartphone, although it can work without it, performing functions, in fact, hours with an alarm clock and timer, the ability to view previously downloaded messages and launch previously installed games. <br><br>  Considerable enthusiasm is the very idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcontrolling a huge Xperia Z Ultra device, which is not too convenient to get out of your pocket once more, for example, switching a track or checking mail (and in winter it's good!). Situation when the phone is charging , while you are sitting on the couch and do not want to go after it again, it also demonstrates the advantages of Smart Watch. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ce2/345/59a/ce234559a1cf5eb914599a5b60e532ea.jpg"><br><br>  To turn on the clock for the first time, it‚Äôs enough to hold the side button for three seconds, the device boots in less than two seconds and takes about a second to establish a connection with the smartphone (taking into account the fact that you have already created a bluetooth pair).  You can connect the watch either with the help of NFC - simply by attaching it to the device, or in a standard way - through a search for bluetooth devices.  After that, you may have to install a new version of SmartConnect and the SmartWatch 2 application on your phone, if you do not do this, the clock will show the corresponding icons.  Theoretically, the watch is compatible with any smartphones running Android OS above 4.0 and supporting Bluetooth 3.0.  In practice, we, of course, could not check everything, but they worked perfectly with devices from three different manufacturers.  But with the iPhone and iPad clock will not work, do not even try. <br><br>  A big update 1.0.B.3.46 / 1.0.A.3.8 was released a few days ago, which adds several new dials, as well as a quick scrolling of screens and the ability to mark all messages as read. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6a3/433/a98/6a3433a9813bce00dc4c270960e2e23d.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9aa/93b/276/9aa93b276536747f36dcfa8bd26ee67c.jpg"><br><br>  With the setting of notifications I had to tinker.  If you thoughtlessly turn on everything, the clock turns into a compact vibrating massager, reporting every new tweet and message in the Facebook chat, and some of the notifications can be turned off only in the applications that send them.  I left only notifications about new SMS and letters, everything else, in my opinion, is more convenient to check on my own and not every three seconds.  It is still inconvenient to read big letters, however, on this screen (although they read the same six years ago and did not complain), only the text version without links and attachments is displayed to speed up the process.  You can only reply to an SMS with a pre-prepared template, or install a third-party typing application, but this seems to me to be unreasonably difficult - it‚Äôs easier, after all, to get the phone. <br><br>  The most interesting features of SmartWatch 2, like the previous model, appear after installing additional applications, of which there are more than three hundred in the Play Market.  For lovers of customization and "customization for themselves" here is a real expanse.  Part of the widgets, however, was developed for the previous version of the watch and is not optimized for a higher resolution of the new model, however, the official applications from Sony were updated in a timely manner. <br><br>  Installing applications for SW2 is not an obvious process.  You need to look for them in the usual Play Market and install them via your phone, like any other.  If everything went well, a new icon will appear on the clock screen. <br><br>  The most useful seemed to me such widgets as Walkman player controls (allows you to switch tracks, displays their names and covers) and various sports trackers like Runstatic (by the way, a PRO version of this application comes bundled).  The clock shows the distance that you walked, ran, cycled or skied, and calories burned. <br>  Those who have a habit of losing the phone at their home will surely be happy about the possibility of quickly searching it with the help of the corresponding widget - when you press the button, the lost phone will vibrate and give audible signals (in the nineties, I remember, made similar key chains). <br>  Controlling the camera via a smartwatch is a fun thing, but not too often used, it can, perhaps, be suitable for shooting self-portraits.  In addition, there is nothing to press the clock button, because  the second hand holds the phone. <br>  for SW2 enthusiasts have developed a number of fairly simple and undemanding games, including snake, tic-tac-toe and other fast-paced entertainment with simple graphics.  It is worth noting the numerous calendars, calculators, alarm clocks, applications for creating notes, as well as mode switches of the smartphone (quick access to control WiFi, GPS and other energy-intensive functions, which, sometimes, should be turned off).  Of the more ‚Äúheavy‚Äù widgets, there are RSS readers, PDF readers and even a fully working browser.  To get on the links in it, though, it turns out times from the fifth, but you can quickly find an article in Wikipedia. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8c5/843/16d/8c584316d4bc5cd657189ac2e8dc3e81.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4b7/b8c/5ac/4b7b8c5ac4c17b883bed3bf32a44d5bc.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Outside and inside</b> <br><br>  The lines and design of the whole SmartWatch 2 are reminiscent of Sony's flagship models released this year - paired with the Xperia Z or Z1, they look very harmonious: rounded corners, a silver metal frame around the screen, a large round unlock button.  Of course, such external similarity does not negate compatibility with older models and smartphones from other manufacturers). <br>  Below the screen are three touch buttons (home, back and menu), familiar to many of last year‚Äôs flagship models like Xperia Acro S, on the right side there is a metal power on and unlock button, and on the left, a micro USB port covered with a cap. <br><br>  The 1.6-inch LCD screen with a resolution of 220x176 and a density of 176 ppi is bright enough, does not glare, clearly responds to pressing - in general, does not cause any complaints, except that it is not covered with a factory film, but the Xperia smartphones in principle, much less likely to scratch. <br>  The maximum time of the SmartWatch 2 from one charge is 7 days, but with more or less intensive use of the battery lasts for 5 days, which, however, is also very good. <br>  SmartWatch 2 is protected in accordance with the standard IP57, which means protection against dust and the possibility of short-term immersion of the device in water to a depth of no more than one meter, so that you can safely wash your hands without removing the watch. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fdf/2ca/371/fdf2ca371e375d1a91369b6156c9985d.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/636/cf8/028/636cf8028a36be88de7ce43c9bfa114f.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Summary</b> <br><br>  Stylish and convenient device, greatly facilitating the interaction with the smartphone.  A regular user will be able to switch music without getting the phone out of his pocket or searching for it in the room, and enthusiasts will be pleased with the wide possibilities of customization and the ability to write their own application.  Strict appearance allows you to wear a watch along with a business suit, and interchangeable straps allow you to combine it with more frivolous clothes. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/205912/">https://habr.com/ru/post/205912/</a></p>
