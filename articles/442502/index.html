This is due to norepinephrine, which does not allow us to relax while the body is in an upright position. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qr/md/nj/qrmdnja-xlx7hkawr-0zodqzhow.jpeg"><br><br>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãworking with a computer lying for the first time came to me back in the days of the students, when, after sitting on a cheap office chair, the loin was very numb.  A quick search on the Internet showed that office fashion is silent about this, and inexpensive home-made solutions exist, but it all looked so dubious and unaesthetic that it discouraged everyone from repeating the feats of craftsmen. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The idea was forgotten for many years, and I returned to it as a mature developer, accidentally seeing a video about <a href="https://www.pinterest.ru/ergoquest/zero-gravity-workstations/%3Flp%3Dtrue">Zero Gravity Workstation</a> on YouTube once.  In this project, everything is fine except for the price.  Paying about 5 thousand dollars for changing the position of the body in space seemed to me too wasteful, even despite the full support of my wife: ‚ÄúOf course, buy a computer, because your main occupation, undoubtedly you deserve it!  A little bit to collect and ... ".  No, darling.  Thank you but no.

      So I set out to build a structure that is not much inferior in terms of convenience and aesthetics, but much cheaper. <br><br>  I started the search with the most important part - the sunbed.  The choice stopped on a <a href="https://market.yandex.by/search%3Ftext%3Dsundays%2520fgxtc-0019%26clid%3D545%26local-offers-first%3D0">folding lounge chair</a> .  I had some doubts about its durability and comfort, but they disappeared as soon as I tried it in life. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/5i/rh/6g/5irh6gigknn2wq-kpjhc8lbz1pm.jpeg"><br><br>  The next step was to place the monitors - I have two of them.  I chose the simplest <a href="https://kron.by/catalog/kronshteyny_dlya_monitorov/2_monitora/arm_media_lcd_t13/">mount</a> to the table, without newfangled gas lifts.  Having tried on the resulting construction, I outlined the path for the following modifications.  A laptop, or a keyboard, no matter how light they may be, is inconvenient to keep on your lap ‚Äî too low and even a little weight is tiring.  To solve this, an overhead shelf with attachment to a table for a laptop was ordered on <a href="https://ru.aliexpress.com/item/OA-1S-360-2-1-Tablet-PC/32853176194.html">aliexpress</a> .  In my case, it had to be placed upside down so that the mount was lower and not higher. <br><br>  There was no place for the mouse.  At first, I wanted to try to make some kind of shelf too, expanding the armrest of the chaise longue, but googling stopped at a new and unusual yet version with a <a href="https://support.logitech.com/en_ca/product/trackman-marble">trackball</a> (experimenting - so to the fullest!).  Subsequently, I did not regret it; it was quite easy to get used to the trackball and it turned out to be even easier to control the cursor with the movement of the fingers than to move the hand with the mouse.  Tunnel syndrome, it's not about you, but about me, we can't be together. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rc/g_/ed/rcg_ed8khqm3ww9nyoezxexmfxk.jpeg"><br><br>  When everything was ordered, arrived and installed - one more defect was discovered, it was quite inconvenient to occupy and leave the workplace.  To solve this problem, the chaise lounge was put on small wheels from a furniture store, after which the exit from behind the computer with the departure back became something like a bailout. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/o8/fy/k-/o8fyk-s_8nui2khr43_lruq06uu.jpeg"><br><br>  What especially pleases, if necessary, in a couple of minutes the workplace is transformed into a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù one - the monitors simply turn in the opposite direction, and the laptop is placed on the table.  In the recumbent position, the second part of the table is used for manual work.  I like to think by drawing on the board, so she took center stage. <br><br>  For operation I want to note two points.  First, I really did not get tired physically, being at the computer.  Before that, I tried different office chairs, including quite expensive ones, with all the adjustments possible, and the chaise is still more convenient due to the lack of strain on the back. <br><br>  Secondly, I began to approach less to the computer during off-hours.  The monitor on the table does not attract ‚Äúwell, go, look, didn‚Äôt someone write there‚Äù, a certain line appeared between classes and this made life better. <br><br>  Estimated transformation: <br><br><ul><li>  Furniture wheels with mounts $ 15 </li><li>  Laptop shelf $ 70 </li><li>  Trackball Logitech TrackMan Marble $ 35 </li><li>  Racks of monitors $ 30 </li><li>  Chaise lounge $ 50 </li></ul><br>  <b>Total:</b> $ 200 (if you already have a table and computer) <br><br>  I hope my humble experiments will inspire other seekers of working comfort to new discoveries. <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> Added a video how to get there, get out and why a deck chair is desirable folding. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/msfVdsh9VAQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/442502/">https://habr.com/ru/post/442502/</a></p>
