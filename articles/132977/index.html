There are only a few of them in Russia, judging by the fact that they could not find a single message about buying or selling.  From Europe or the United States no one carries anything directly to Russia.  eBay refused on all existing offers.  In the USA I ordered through the forwarding man, they kept silent for half a month, now they woke up, but those American ones are still flying.  The American version has a slightly different layout, as far as the concept of a layout can be applied here. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f50/ddf/57a/f50ddf57ae1ebc1e512cf447bce48946.jpg">

      DasKeyboard is made in two series - Ultimate and Professional.  Each series has one standard model and one ‚ÄúSilent‚Äù modification. <br><br>  The Professional series has normal inscriptions on the buttons (it is clear that the Cyrillic alphabet is not there).  But the Ultimate series is the most interesting, all the keys are absolutely and dull black.  This is exactly what I ordered for myself (plus I still have friends :). <br><br>  So, what is it remarkable? <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The keyboard is heavy - weighs 1.36 kg.  It is very convenient, it does not crawl on the table, but stands as poured.  Buttons are almost staggering.  Pressing the key gives a clear click, and the character of this click is different - in Backspace it is a little different, for example.  It was even thought out that the keys pressed by the little fingers should require less pressure. <br><br>  Keyboard True N-key Rollover - this means that you can press at least five, six keys simultaneously.  Each key is scanned completely independently and the operation of each key does not depend on whether the next button is pressed, unlike conventional keyboards, where the keys are polled through the ‚Äúmatrix‚Äù.  In conventional keyboards, there are ways to prevent problems with simultaneous pressing, but they do not always work simply because of the matrix design.  Here, each key is a separate mechanism.  The kit includes a USB-PS / 2 adapter.  I thought it was just a tribute to the old "cars", where there is no USB - and not, it turned out.  PS / 2 allows you to use more than six simultaneous clicks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8d4/f12/fce/8d4f12fcee4de209a92e990b57eca79f.jpg"><br><br>  Buttons in the Ultimate series on the mechanics of Cherry MX Blue.  Considered the best for typing.  The design is such that the fingers easily pick up the moment of the operation of the key.  Some people like to play keyboards with Cherry MX Blue switches, but most have difficulty re-pressing quickly.  By the way, this is the only mechanism in the entire Cherry lineup that makes the same clicking sound.  Which, some, probably, remember on IBM Model M. However, there the design of buttons was much simpler, more stupid and more unreliable.  But the sound is similar (although softer). <br><br><img src="http://www.cheklab.ru/images/stories/keyboard_mechanic/animation_cherry_mx_blue.gif"><br><br>  Reliability mechanism - 50 million clicks.  This is 10-20 times more than membrane keyboards.  However, no membrane keyboard in my contacts has yet broken, but the notebook keys themselves have failed more than once. <br><br>  For those who still do not know how to type "blindly" - the skill is acquired in a couple of days.  It's like in that "Jumble" about the Brazilian system.  Regular keyboard dampens - you can always peep and we use it all the time.  There is also an interesting feature: as soon as you try to look, you stumble.  One has only to relax and reap "on a whim" - as soon as you get into the right button.  Day or two - and the problems disappear completely. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/39e/d05/127/39ed05127117771e54b91842a3399340.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a3b/af6/647/a3baf6647c3993e24f7cc3b1fb70a6dd.jpg"><br><br>  The USB 2.0 hub is built into the keyboard.  The keyboard itself takes a couple of USB ports (or USB + PS / 2). <br><br>  So, I have this keyboard in two pieces - for myself and for someone.  Another pair flies from the USA.  Who cares - throw contacts). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/132977/">https://habr.com/ru/post/132977/</a></p>
