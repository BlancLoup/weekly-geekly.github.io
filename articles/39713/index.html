  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Relaxing with apple flavor</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Suppose you are going or are considering to go to rest in Europe.  Then do not forget that in addition to pleasant impressions and souvenirs, you can bring a Mac from there.  I'll tell you about my own experience of buying a computer in Spain and will be very happy if this article will help you in the same. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I traveled to Spain to relax on the coast of <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0-%25D0%2594%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B0">Costa Daurada</a> , which is not far from the capital of Catalonia - Barcelona.  The decision to buy an iMac was made before departure, so I was preoccupied with searching for places where apple appliances are for sale. <br>  All store addresses can be found on <a href="http://store.apple.com/Catalog/US/Images/intlstoreroutingpage.html">local</a> Apple <a href="http://store.apple.com/Catalog/US/Images/intlstoreroutingpage.html">sites</a> .  In Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãthe most convenient is El Corte Ingl√©s, which is located on the Plaza Catalunya in the city center.  This store network, so you should be careful and do not go to another.  For the presence of the Apple Store there, I can not vouch :) It's easy to get there.  Virtually any sightseeing tours to the city provide for free time.  As a rule, tourists are left in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe main street - La Rambla, which stretches from the old port to the square of Catalonia we need. <br><br>  If you are left in Plaza Catalunya, then in three minutes you will be in the store.  If in the port, as happened to me - enjoy a walk along this Barcelona Arbat.  I emphasize, <i>enjoy</i> .  Because the way back with the <s>heavy, foolish</s> cherished box in your hands will not seem like honey.  Along the way, I advise you to go to the market and eat fresh exotic and not very fruit, packaged in single-use packages.  In Russia, there is no such Eden ... :( <br><br>  Let's go back to the store.  From the entrance you are looking for the nearest escalator going up.  You go up to the 7th floor, looking at the boutiques with pretty clothes and furniture.  After you are on the top floor, walk literally 15 meters ahead and you can see on the left what interests us - the Apple store.

      After you have chosen the model you need, do not forget to tell the seller to design Tax Free.  For those who are not aware of - the return of the value-added tax (in Spain, the NDS is called IVA and is about 16%) to non-residents of the country (yeah, to us tourists) leaving it is practiced in all developed countries.  Tax Free in the European Union is issued for goods worth more than ‚Ç¨ 90.  Do not forget that both for registration Tax Free, and when paying by credit card you need to have a passport with you.  (A copy, in principle, also passes). <br>  Be careful, the final design of Tax Free is not from the seller, but in a special place.  In El Corte Ingl√©s, it is on the second floor minus.  There, they will offer you a choice of tax refund methods - in cash or on a card and, besides Tax Free documents themselves, they will be given a piece of paper that shows a plan of action for returning blood at the airport of departure.  If you hint at their nationality, the paper will be in Russian. <br><br>  Directly at the airport, you need to go to the customs counter with a passport, check, plane ticket and TaxFree documents, defend the queue (10-30 minutes) and get the treasured seal on the documents and go to the cashier of one of the two banks located in the terminal.  There you will get the money back, keeping a penny for it. <br><br>  Savings obtained very tangible.  If I paid ‚Ç¨ 1250 in the store (about 45,000 rubles), then returning to the airport ‚Ç¨ 170 reduced costs to 39,000. As you understand, buying a top iMac 20 in Moscow, and indeed in Russia, is unreal for such money. <br>  The only small inconvenience was the lack of Russian letters on the keyboard and the presence of Spanish-type √± :) <br><br>  UPD: Regarding our customs.  In the Russian Federation allowed the unimpeded importation of goods worth 65000r.  I just walked past all these red corridors and X-rays with a quick step and did not bother.  However, if you are carrying a beech or something small in addition, you can take it out of the packaging and put it in your backpack.  Then its nominal value decreases sharply and customs loses interest in it. <br><br>  So, if you have the right amount, a trip abroad and some optimism - everything will work out.  There is nothing difficult in this, and buying equipment in other stores and / or countries differs only in nuances. <br><br>  Good luck!  Thanks for attention.  ;) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/39713/">https://habr.com/ru/post/39713/</a></p>
