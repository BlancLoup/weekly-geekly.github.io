  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Once again on the incredible loyalty of Logitech support</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Several times I read some (as it seemed then) tales of support for Logitech products: they say they send new devices instead of old ones, and just after handling the problem and displaying photos.  There were mentions that the old device had to be somehow put into disrepair, while observing a certain procedure, some more dances with a tambourine, and as a result, a free new device.  Somehow it all looked like bikes and somewhere far away (thousands so three kilometers west of my place of residence) close to reality, and probably a little embellished in the stories.  In short - I did not believe in free cheese.  I recently gained my own experience working with Logitech support, and I must say, I was just amazed! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Prologue </h3><br>  I like the products of this company, many years of love have led to the formation of an entire collection of different devices - from simple OEM mice to flagship webcams, but I haven‚Äôt yet appreciated the keyboard (hello to the ‚Äúwrong‚Äù Enter keys and vertical blocks with PageUp and PageDown).  Most of this zoo is naturally made up of different mice, but until recently I regarded them solely as an expendable material that did not obey any guarantees at all, I estimated the life cycle of the device solely as ‚Äúworked ‚Üí broke ‚Üí burned ‚Üí bought new‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b00/98c/a4e/b0098ca4ed0bc779fb4b6a770e5a9b14.jpg" align="right" alt="Logitech VX Revolution">  Three years ago, for my birthday, I was presented with a VX Revolution - a very successful wireless model of the time with a new-fashioned laser sensor.  The electronic rodent behaved quite well after a couple of years, but from a year ago it began to ache with the left button, which at first began to sometimes not respond to pressing, then react once, then react only occasionally, and eventually went into a coma.  The rest of the mouse felt great, chased the cursor briskly, responded without question to pressing the other numerous buttons, and it was also pleasant to pull the wheel in both axes.  However, without the left button, the mouse is no longer capable of action and is written off to a well-deserved retirement pension. <br><br>  Around this moment I just updated some devices, among other things, I got a new laptop, to which the described rodent was very useful.  But once such a thing - in its place immediately after the cancellation of the handicapped person, the fresh Anywhere Mouse MX was formed, the pleasure of which allowed us to forget about the pensioner before the beginning of this spring.

    <h3>  "Am I trembling or do I have the right?" </h3><br>  Once again shaking a box with peripheral small things in search of some kind of cable or adapter, my eyes fell on the pensioner and I felt sorry for him.  Sometimes it seems to me that I have relatively small hands and my set of tools is enough to repair some electronic devices, plus specialized education ... In short, I decided to try to fix it.  However, the complete lack of mounting connectors on the case puzzled me a little - there was a suspicion that they were hiding under the teflon lining.  I had already prepared a scalpel for their amputation, as the memories of the bikes mentioned at the beginning of the narrative swept through my head.  "At the same time I will have time to break," I thought and climbed onto the manufacturer‚Äôs website. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cda/409/05f/cda40905fb497b181dc56ad9eed53b88.jpg" align="right" alt="Logitech Marathon Mouse M705">  After going through a rather straightforward registration procedure, I wrote a simple question in the form of a malfunction ‚Äúthen it‚Äôs broken, what to do?‚Äù Through the application form about problems in my native Russian.  A day later I received an answer in the same Russian language, which supposedly expired warranty period (reading the answer in this place I almost closed the browser and reached for a scalpel reflexively), <i><b>but!</b></i>  But the company wants to meet each other and offers me to consider the option of replacing my device with the Marathon Mouse M705.  It required only my consent and coordinates, in response to which it was promised to send further instructions. <br><br>  It was here that I put down the scalpel and began to remember where my hammer lay.  As promised in the letter, in response to my letter of agreement with the coordinates, instructions were sent where it was necessary to send photos of the device from both sides on a sheet of paper with the ‚Äúincident number‚Äù written on it, which was immediately reported in the text.  <i>And not a word about the hammer</i> and other bloody details of the massacre of the pensioner.  Ok, I decided that I would probably see the details of the device annihilation requirements in the next series.  However, after providing the described photo evidence of ownership of the device, the story turned out to be a very unexpected plot twist for me, at the same time leading it to a logical denouement: I just received a notification that a package was sent to me from Holland, as well as its tracking number and link to the site of the deliveryman. <br><br>  Three days later (two of which were on weekends) my morning was diluted with pleasant news by a courier who informed me by phone that I had received a package and asked where and when I can hand it over, which was done half an hour after the call. <br><br>  Everything.  I even somehow did not immediately realize that all this had happened in reality, for another half a day I was haunted by the feeling that I had been stabbed somewhere!  Well, please, judge for yourself: the mouse, whose warranty has ended, is changing me for free to a new model, with a model that is similar in quality and characteristics, and for free for three days I am delivered from Holland to Novosibirsk, and at a convenient place and time.  <i>Even without minced meat with crushing the old device with a heavy blunt object.</i>  The quest is completed: the veteran is still hopelessly ill, but he is alive and continues his pension in a box with other peripherals, but an evolved descendant arrived in his place. <br><br>  And all this because I just asked a question.  In fact, in addition to photographs of the device on a sheet of paper, I did not provide any documents, even in electronic form. <br><br>  <i><b>PS: It is</b> even difficult to imagine the similar behavior of domestic companies (including those representing foreign companies) in the framework of the established practice of working with clients.</i>  <i>But it turns out - that‚Äôs how it is like a human being.</i>  <i>My deepest homage, Logitech!</i> <br><br>  <i><b>PPS:</b> After reading quite a few comments about the loss of receivers, I would have already started selling them as separate devices in place of Logitech.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/143718/">https://habr.com/ru/post/143718/</a></p>
