  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Pirate Manifest or a Dozen Knives in the Back of the Rightholder</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Friends!  Good day to you! <br><br>  Very briefly about myself - I am a professional musician and leader of the VIA CHAPPA # 1 group.  I love all good music, regardless of the genre.  But I do rap myself - it's just a vocation. <br><br>  Here I decided to write this topic to get your opinion on the issue of digital content.  I cite My Manifesto, and not the fact that I am right.  But I have been sticking to this view of things since 2001, and I get from this a real RESULT!  Do you think my ‚Äúpirate manifesto‚Äù has a future? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I note that over the years I have been completely open and publicly speaking out against the so-called ‚Äúlegal download of mp3 and files‚Äù and streaming on the Internet.  I don‚Äôt presume to say, but it seems that in the musical get-together I am almost the only Artist, Author and Rightholder, who methodically does everything to ‚Äúdestroy the content market‚Äù in the form that now exists in Russia.  So: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <strong>I oppose the ‚Äúlegal mp3 market‚Äù because:</strong> <br>  1. Mp3 - just a pathetic copy of the wav-original.  With the cost of the uploaded album from $ 2.e (on almost all mp3 services), the price for this pathetic copy is higher than the wholesale price of a CD (42 rubles).  This is an unfair price. <br>  2. In 95% of cases, the mp3 ‚Äúclings‚Äù from the wav format to disgusting codecs that give a disgusting sound.  Isn't it a shame for asking for money? <br>  3. Bitrate 128 and 256, hmm ... Even on FM stations they play as 320. (Naive one thinks there is vinyl or CD? :) We don‚Äôt buy the right to listen on the radio. <br>  4. Broadband Internet is available only to residents of large cities, so downloading mp3 320 Kbps is already spending money and time.  And then there's the cost of mp3. <br><br>  <strong>I urge musicians and copyright holders not to replace the free download with mp3 streaming (online players), because:</strong> <br>  5. Streaming does not allow ‚Äúto possess‚Äù, but what's the point of enjoying what you see and hear, if you can't have it?  We live in the company of consumers! <br>  6. Streaming broadcasting does not strengthen the fame of the artist or copyright holder and does not contribute to increasing popularity. <br>  7. Streaming devours user traffic.  And this is the user's money, really given for the air (on air). <br>  8. Streaming is suitable for daily news, but not for ‚Äútouching the story,‚Äù which is music and video. <br><br>  <strong>I propose to promote and provide to my customers (listeners, viewers, etc.) only free downloads of mp3, video and files, because:</strong> <br>  9. Each uploaded Author file or mp3, or video is an advertising booklet about the Author, brought to your client‚Äôs home.  And with the hands of the same client. * <br>  10. Each uploaded Author file or mp3, or video is the creation of a trust relationship between the Rights Holder and the client.  Why this, read Seth Godin. <br>  11. Each uploaded Author file or mp3, or video is another completed step to the sale of the Brand of the Author.  Yes, yes, Brenda Author, not his files.  After all, the Author's Brand (promoted trademark) is an increased added value to everything that his hand touches. <br>  12. Each uploaded Author file or mp3, or video is the possible attraction of new customers to the business.  For the natural human generosity and thirst for communication leads people to share knowledge and values.  Especially if you did not have to pay for them. <br><br>  And how to make money on these calculations?  Yes, read the conclusions received from Habrovskoy news about Radiohead, for example, <a href="http://tavly.blogspot.com/2007/10/10-2.html">here</a> or think for yourself.  ;) <br>  After all, having a base of customers who trust you, you can easily convert it into crispy green cutlets. <br>  ================================================= = <br>  Friends, what are your thoughts on my manifesto? <br>  Smash me to pieces or subscribe to every word?  Just ask you - constructive. <br><br>  Thanks for attention!  :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/15437/">https://habr.com/ru/post/15437/</a></p>
