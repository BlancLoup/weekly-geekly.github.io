At first, no one wanted to believe in it, and everyone thought that maybe this was just a mistake or they checked the defective TV.  However, as it turned out, ANY of the tested D6x00 reduces the resolution very much, regardless of the size of the matrix, no matter 32 or 50 inches.  Therefore, we decided to create this Wiki page so that you can check your TV for the presence of this defect. <br><br>  What we were supposed to see turned out to be a shocking loss of quality when you turn on 3D. <br>  You can see this in the photo on the side of this page. <br><br>  If the TV can show this picture in Full HD 3D format, then there should be no difference between the 2D and 3D versions of the images. <br><br>  <b>We found that the D7x00 and D8x000 series do not have this defect.</b> <br><br>  SamyGO participants understand that the TV turns on the Low Quality Frame Buffer Resolution option when the 3D mode is turned on.  At the same time, even content such as menus, text, and graphic icons decreases quality.  We don‚Äôt know why Samsung needs switching to Low Quality Frame Buffer when 3D is turned on.  I have doubts that this is an unconscious low-level error in the D6x00 series. <br>  Some users have reported that <b>this defect is not visible on the 60-inch TV series D6x00</b> , which is quite expensive. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cf9/a6a/a74/cf9a6aa7467a7ad81b1ae6e9fff40857.jpg" alt="3D resolution loss"><br>  <i>The TV compresses the original frame of 1920x1080 (up to 960x1080 or 1920x540 pixels per eye), then increases it, therefore the HALF resolution is lost.</i> <i><br></i>  <i><u>But this is not the end of quality.</u></i>  <i><u>In the ‚ÄúVertical stereo pair‚Äù mode (‚ÄúTop-and-bottom‚Äù), the bottom frame (1920x540) is enlarged to the size of 1920x1080 and the vertical Odd lines are repeated and superimposed over the EVEN lines.</u></i>  <i><u>This means that the bottom image (for the right eye) has only 25% (or 960x540) of the quality of the original left (1920x1080).</u></i> <br><br><h4>  Fraud or mistake? </h4><br>  It will depend on how Samsung arrives.  <b>Samsung sold these devices, promising Full HD 3D</b> .  This information is stated on all <a href="http://www.samsung.com/ru/consumer/televisions/televisions/tv-led/UE37D6100SWXRU-features">web pages</a> , TV boxes, as well as advertising pictures on the TV itself!  If they did not develop the D6x00 series with full support for Full HD 3D, and if the poor quality of the picture is caused by the lack of necessary equipment in our devices, this means <b>that Samsung was trying to deceive customers!</b>  They cheat on people by submitting incorrect information.  In addition, no company makes such big ‚Äúmistakes‚Äù.  She knows what she did. <br>  People could choose another brand of TV instead of this filth.  But they choose this one because of Samsung Full HD 3D.  Now they are all deceived.  Samsung cannot get away with this simple apology.  They must be convicted of fraud.  They must also recall TVs and refund the full price, or offer a free upgrade to the D7000. <br><br>  But if Samsung asks forgiveness, fixes the problem in the next firmware update, that's good.  This situation is reminiscent of another Samsung fraud in history.  In this way, Samsung could have avoided fraud allegations ... <br><br><h4>  Evidence cannot be ignored. </h4><br>  If you have <a href="http://wiki.samygo.tv/index.php5/Ex-Link_Cable_for_C/D_Series">an ExLink cable</a> , you can view the TV debugging messages. <a href="" title="Samsung UA40D6000, the youngest model in the model range D6 LED, the box has a FULL HD 3D logo in the lower left corner."><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a9a/c37/33a/a9ac3733a5c908dec51b1e26a2bab4dd.jpg" alt="image" align="right"></a> <br><br>  You need to go to the Service Menu and change the connection type from RS232 to DEBUG. <br><br>  Then, at boot time, you can see a thick line at the bottom, between many other debug / error / notification messages. <br><br>  The message says one thing: the TV does not support Full HD 3D (Obtained from the UA40D6000 T-GAS6DEUC 1014.1) <br><pre><code class="dos hljs">...

And if your TV also has this defect, please call Samsung or email them, ask why the TV does not show 3D in FULL HD resolution. <br><br>  Also read the Consumer Protection Act in your country ... In most modern countries, the buyer may be able to choose from the following options in case of a TV malfunction: <br><ul><li>  You can <b>return the device</b> and return the money in full. </li><li>  You can <b>get a free upgrade</b> to the D7000 series, which has Full HD 3D. </li><li>  You may request a reduction in price due to a defect.  As if you wanted to return the price difference between the D5000 / D6000. </li></ul><br><h5>  In Russia </h5><br>  Televisions are on the <a href="http://www.rg.ru/2011/11/16/slojtovary-dok.html">list of technically complex products</a> . <br>  <b>Under <a href="http://www.consultant.ru/popular/consumerism/37_2.html">the Consumer Protection Act (art. 18)</a> :</b> <br>  In the case of a technically complex product, the consumer, in the event of deficiencies in it, has the right to refuse to execute the contract of sale and to demand the return of the amount paid for such goods or to demand to replace it with a product of the same brand (model, article) or another brand (model, article) with a corresponding recalculation of the purchase price within fifteen days from the date of transfer of such goods to the consumer.  After the expiration of this period, these requirements shall be satisfied in one of the following cases: <br><ul><li>  detection of a <b>significant shortage of</b> goods; </li><li>  violation of the <b>deadlines for elimination of defects in the</b> goods established by this Law; </li><li>  the impossibility of using the goods during each year of the warranty period in the aggregate of more than thirty days <b>due to the repeated elimination of its various shortcomings</b> . </li></ul><br><br>  Samsung "must" accept the choice of the buyer - there is no other way ... <br><br>  In some countries, you can return the TV and return the amount paid for it, <b>even after the warranty period</b> for the corresponding type of defect has <b>expired</b> . <br><br><h4>  What is the Samsung Opinion? </h4><br>  Like the SamyGO community, we also sent problem letters to some Samsung managers directly, and asked for solutions to this problem. <br><br>  We are waiting for an answer to a question from Samsung for several weeks.  But they prefer to remain silent.  I do not understand why such a company did not quickly turn to us and did not say anything about such a big problem. <br><br>  Personally, I think they wanted to cover up the situation.  But we will raise this issue, and <b>try to protect the rights of consumers!</b> <br><br>  We will post a response from Samsung here and in the SamyGO forum if they decide to answer ... <br><br><h4>  Samsung-Germany acknowledged defect </h4><br>  Recently, there were news about TVs that can not show Full HD.  Samsung in Germany decided to return ‚Ç¨ 150 for a faulty TV ( <a href="http://mydealz.de/17745/genial-150e-kulanzgutschrift-von-samsung-fuer-die-uexxd6xx0-serie-wegen-falscher-werbeaussage">in German</a> or use the <a href="http%253A%252F%252Fwww.mydealz.de%252F17745%252Fgenial-150e-kulanzgutschrift-von-samsung-fuer-die-uexxd6xx0-serie-wegen-falscher-werbeaussage%252F">English version</a> ).  This is too little for such a defect, but better than nothing.  Samsung Global has not said a word about this situation yet.  So did not respond to our letters. <br><br><h4>  Addition </h4><br>  <b>In addition, I attach photos of my TV when displaying test pictures.</b> <br>  On the pictures: on the left - 2D, on the right - 3D mode. <br>  You can clearly see the distortion on small letters - in 3D they can not be disassembled. <br> <a href="" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/80b/c89/a71/80bc89a71156ce7d3158abe6738dfdf3.jpg" height="133" width="200"></a> <br>  We look closer, the steps in 3D on the right are clearly visible <br> <a href="" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2ee/ecb/585/2eeecb585244e5d827d628209b1acb6e.jpg" height="90" width="200"></a> <br><br>  <u>I contacted Samsung Russia tech support with this problem.</u> <br>  <b>Samsung response dated June 6, 2012</b> <br><blockquote>  Welcome to Samsung Electronics United Support Service. <br>  Thank you for your interest in Samsung products. <br>  Your request number 2109356100 We ask you to indicate it when you will <br>  contact us in the future. <br><br>  According to the internal standard of Samsung, 6-series TVs are called FullHD 3D, because  reproduce the Full HD 3D content fed to it, in 3D mode with FullHD resolution.  Televisions of this series support 3D Full HD mode (i.e., absolutely identical to all older TVs of the D7000, D8000 series), but some differences in image quality are due to differences in signal processing technologies of different TV series.  Those.  The quality of signal processing depends on the performance of the processor, and a more efficient processor is installed in the more expensive TV. <br><br>  If you have any further questions, you can ask them to us by <br>  phone 8-800-555-55-55 (free call from any region of Russia) <br>  or use the opportunity to send us an email <br>  mail using the ‚ÄúContact Us‚Äù section on our website <a href="http://www.samsung.com/">www.samsung.com</a> . <br><br>  respectfully <br><br>  Unified support service <br>  Samsung Electronics Russia <br></blockquote><br><br>  It looks like double standards, for expensive TVs full Full HD 3D, and for less expensive ones just a bit Full HD 3D. <br>  <b>Tell me, what to answer this support?</b> <br><br>  UPD 07.06.12 - The contact form for technical support via E-Mail has stopped working on the SAMSUNG website. <br><br>  <b>PS I ask you to make comments / clarifications to the translation.</b> <br>  Slightly corrected the translation, making it more readable. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/145249/">https://habr.com/ru/post/145249/</a></p>
