      This year we held the event for the second time ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/events/536/">announcement of the qualifying round in the events in Habr√©</a> ) and I must say that this time everything that was intended by the organizers was possible (or almost everything;)) <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  All-Ukrainian Championship and held in 2 rounds: <br><br><ul><li>  online stage (up to 1000 participants) </li><li>  the final part in Kiev (76 winners of the online tour, but this year they took more, because not everyone arrives, as a rule) </li></ul><br>  In the final, we selected (with the help of <a href="http://www.uwc.org.ua/ru/judges">our jury</a> ) 71 participants and 5 teams (teams could consist of a maximum of 3 people). <br><br>  Participants of the final represented <b>21 cities of</b> Ukraine.  At the same time 10 girls got to the final (more than 10% (!) Of the total number of finalists). <br><br>  What is important for participants - nonresidents (who registered before the specified date for the championship), we settled in hotels, here with such numbers (last year there were hostels): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/348/68b/71b/34868b71b07e07f47ec038be2f871a94.jpg" alt="image"><br><blockquote>  Photo: Pavel Grishko </blockquote><br><h1>  The final </h1><br>  The venue for the finals was kindly provided by our partner, <a href="http://www.ciklum.net/">Ciklum</a> .  And we took advantage of this opportunity in full - we occupied as many as 3 floors (18, 19 and 20) :) <br><br>  By the way, each participant of the final received such a pretty T-shirt with Yoda and a badge (double-sided!) At the registration: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0f8/c60/24b/0f8c6024bfdbd37d551d4f4341dc18e9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c36/0e4/66b/c360e466b57ce70c999ccee51602e264.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The event itself was divided into 2 days, the first day the participants decided the tasks, and the second was the presentations from the partners, the jury spoke, the awards and afterparty took place;) <br><br>  <strong>The first day</strong> <br><br>  After the introductory word from the organizers and partners, the participants received tasks and went on their own flows to solve them. <br><br>  Time for decisions was allotted <b>6 hours</b> .  Someone coped in advance, someone sat to the last (some tasks were really difficult to do in 6 hours, try for example to create <a href="">such a layout</a> during this time). <br><br>  During the solution of tasks our Help Team <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/30d/aea/0f9/30daea0f93f0d0311f269db4b03108a9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  distributed to <b>Red Bull</b> participants. <br><br>  The fight turned not comic.  Some participants in the results shared hundredths (!) Points.  We even awarded 2 second places :) <br><br>  After work and delivery of the decisions, the participants expected beer and cider (for girls): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f1c/f0c/48b/f1cf0c48bd73552a2c177bb104af416e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  exchange of experience, impressions and delivery to hotels.  At this program the first day was completed. <br><br>  And for those who wish and those who are not tired - there was still a free and interesting walking tour of Kiev. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/825/f22/a52/825f22a5278e839946888a6d4529c80f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In the meantime, our jury set to work: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/03d/a43/e42/03da43e428193ee25fcb3e97548c52cf.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f1e/c46/fa9/f1ec46fa9cc550fed8fe60993a717f8d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  and while they were working they composed new memes according to the principle that I see, and I sing about it: ‚ÄúYii code‚Äù :) <br><br>  <strong>Second day</strong> <br><br>  The Suddey team worked half the night on the decisions of the participants, while one of them, <a href="http://cssing.org.ua/">Yuri Artyukh,</a> had a <a href="http://cssing.org.ua/">birthday</a> before, and <a href="http://genn.org/">Gennady Osipenko</a> just flew in from a foreign trip.  But this did not prevent them from suing their nominations brilliantly. <br><br>  The participants gathered in the morning (there was a transfer from the hotels to Ciklum) and the day began with the presentations of our partners - each participant could learn more about each company, about open vacancies, prospects, etc. <br><br>  Those who were not interested in the work (many participants came to test their strength, talk with colleagues in arms, etc.) - talked on the sidelines among themselves, played XBox, Playstation 3, table football or simply took pictures in a <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2594%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D1%2582_%25D0%2592%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580">Darth Vader</a> mask: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b1b/579/182/b1b579182808ff3cc2af26eaeba26c33.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  After that, the jury spoke, talked about common mistakes in the qualifying round and final, drew the attention of participants on what to emphasize when solving assignments, in the work and in what direction to develop. <br><br>  Many participants in the questionnaire on the past event expressed that it was very useful and interesting. <br><br>  <b>Finally, the time has come to announce the results and awards!</b> <br><br>  We presented all the winners with such colorful diplomas (with the signatures of the judicial team of their nomination) and medals (for those who took the 1st place): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ce2/87a/1f7/ce287a1f7a98cdabbca33d02c6c4aa21.jpg"><br><br>  General photo of the winners and organizers: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/08f/603/0a5/08f6030a5f3054814966430886b1e311.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  What is remarkable - out of 10 girls participating - 6 (!) Got the winners, and one won in her nomination.  Bravo! <br><br>  It was time for aftepati and again there was beer and cider :) And those who wished could communicate with the judges personally and in an informal setting: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b6e/053/c3b/b6e053c3b21f9109fe43fd94b1d4dae5.jpg" alt="image"><br><blockquote>  Anonymous Architects Club </blockquote><br><h2>  Words of gratitude </h2><br>  First of all, I would very much like to mention the participants of our event - thank you!  Without you it would be impossible, without your enthusiasm, the charge to get the final result and the desire to create and work to the end.  This is a very important quality for a specialist. <br><br>  Secondly - of course, a low bow to our partners - you were not afraid to support our event (and some are not the first time), this is very valuable for us - that they trust us. <br><br>  Thirdly, our friendly Help Team team, which worked as a single organism and knew the answers to all the questions of the participants.  As one of the organizers, it is very important for me to have a reliable rear. <br><br>  And of course - to all critics, you help us make the event every time better and better.  Thank! <br><br>  <b>See you again!</b> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.facebook.com/media/albums/%3Fid%3D109648449109890">Facebook photos</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.uwc.org.ua/ru/finalists">Full final results</a> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/143013/">Unofficial report from day 1 of the UA Web Challenge</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/143419/">https://habr.com/ru/post/143419/</a></p>
