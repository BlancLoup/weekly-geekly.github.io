Is it again an esoteric?‚Äù I thought, having read this name for the first time more than six months ago.  Then she did it, tried to draw her plans for the week in this format.  It turned out surprisingly easy and interesting. <br>  Here I could write that since then I began to use cards all the time, but this is not so.  I forgot about them.  And I remembered only in August, when I was planning a vacation trip.  That's what came out of it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ac0/854/193/ac085419306d445d8362890a65f5a19a.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h5>  <b>What is mind maps</b> </h5><br>  After the first meeting with the cards, several months passed.  I planned my time: the Pomodoro timer rang, the Eisenhower matrix worked, the calendar was replenished with tasks and colored in different colors.  But there was a feeling that there was still some cool method, I just can‚Äôt remember it.

      And suddenly, by chance stumbling upon a review of services for mind cards, I realized what tool I was missing.  The puzzle has developed and gone - a map for going to the store, for planning life goals, for work.  Maps, maps, maps ... They were blue and multi-colored, in mindmaps and on album sheets.  Now the euphoria subsided, and I use them more soberly.  I'll tell you how and when. <br><br><h6>  <b>Intellect card and me</b> </h6><br>  These gizmos are effective where it is necessary to sketch out a general vision of the situation and detail it in stages.  With the help of maps, my colleagues compose semantic cores, design a site map, conduct marketing research, generate ideas, prepare for presentations, organize events, plan a budget, and simply make a weekly to-do list. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ab3/3b5/3b1/ab33b53b17bc4395b5834c5aa7fed5fa.png"><br><br><h6>  <b>Where can I use the cards</b> </h6><br>  <b>1. Work with information (presentations, speeches)</b> <br><br>  <i><b>What i do</b></i> <br>  With the help of maps I collect information, sort it.  What I know about the subject: properties, shortcomings, features, use - all this easily fits into the scheme of the intellect map. <br><br>  <i><b>What do you do</b></i> <br>  Replace the tedious lecture with a simple presentation, and you will attract the attention of the audience.  Replace with an interesting presentation - you also win the respect of listeners. <br><br>  <b>2. Learning and memorization</b> <br><br>  <i><b>What i do</b></i> <br>  The same as in the previous paragraph: I single out the main question, sort it out on the shelves.  A huge plus of cards - you can finish branches, if a new thought suddenly occurred to you.  Therefore, I always draw with a margin.  I don‚Äôt have a very good friendship with services, I prefer a snow-white sheet and colored felt-tip pens. <br><br>  <i><b>What do you do</b></i> <br>  Create lecture notes or books, write various texts (coursework, dissertations, articles), analyze the text.  You can use detailed cards (1 card-1 question), you can write basic diagrams. <br>  By the way, most of you have seen a kind of mind maps in textbooks - these are flowcharts of the main issues of the course. <br><br>  <b>3. Brainstorming.</b> <br><br>  <b><i>What i do</i></b> <br>  I come up with ideas (what to give for a holiday), solve problems (where to find time for classes) - so the cards help in brainstorming.  I can draw cards alone or with colleagues, in any case it is effective. <br><br>  <b><i>What do you do</i></b> <br>  Brainstorming cards are drawn as usual.  In the center - the problem, large branches - solutions, small - features or consequences.  If you need to generate ideas, then there will be a topic in the center, and the ideas themselves will be large branches. <br><br>  <b>4. Making decisions.</b> <br><br>  <b><i>What i do</i></b> <br>  I am a logician to the bone.  Intuitive solutions are not my thing.  And here I have discrepancies with Tony Buzan, the founder of the mind maps method.  It is believed that drawing, the use of symbols stimulate creative thinking, which means that the brain adjusts itself to the search for an effective and non-standard way out of the situation (I don‚Äôt argue with it).  And even at such moments, intuition is turned on and we make a decision based on it (here is a quandary). <br>  Therefore, I simply write a problem in the center of the sheet, designate all possible solutions with level 2 branches, and the consequences of these decisions with level 3 branches. <br><br>  <b><i>What do you do</i></b> <br>  Write down the problem and twist it from all sides, simultaneously recording everything that comes to mind.  Streamlined thoughts - saw the solution.  To whom it is easier to operate with facts and figures, he writes them on the branches.  And whoever relies on intuition will bet on the associativity of the cards. <br><br>  <b>5. Planning.</b> <br><br>  Plan your work and personal projects, budget or time. <br><br>  <b><i>What i do</i></b> <br>  First, on the map, I wrote down all the books I want to read.  Then from the book I singled out the form in which I would assimilate the material (outline, sammari).  And created a similar goal on <a href="https://smartprogress.do/">SmartProgress</a> . <br>  And here such fat lack of cards got out - it is difficult to attach them to terms.  On the Gantt chart, for example, you can clearly see which event and when it should go, you can see the time relationship of the events.  And on the mind map you can only sign the deadline to which you need to complete the task.  In SmartProgress, you can set intermediate deadlines, there are reminders of deadlines.  So in a bundle, these two tools work well. <br><br>  <b><i>What do you do</i></b> <br>  In the center of the sheet, mark the goal, for example, ‚Äúhold a wedding anniversary‚Äù.  And then write down the association.  The choice of venue, guest list, menu, budget, program - these are the key lines of your mind map.  From each large beam a few more small rays depart, specifying who and in what way you invite, what elements of the program will be, and who is responsible for them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ce6/ed3/20c/ce6ed320c9b14757ac0f349c88a88c8a.png"><br><br><h6>  <b>Why such form is advantageous</b> </h6><br>  Any incoming information must first be formed into an image.  Then she will be remembered much easier and for a longer period.  The role of the cards is ordering, systematization, and visual presentation of information.  It doesn't matter if you are planning an anniversary or organizing team work on a project, all the basic data can be placed on one large sheet. <br><br>  The greater the volume of the cerebral cortex that is connected to the perception of information, the better it is remembered.  The brain does not think linearly, but associatively, so for most people the mind map is a suitable tool for planning or working with large amounts of data. <br><br><h6>  <b>Pros and cons of mind maps</b> </h6><br>  I have already written about the shortcomings - there is no interconnectedness with the terms. <br><br>  And now about the merits. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ The brain first focuses on key areas of the project.  It helps to prioritize. <br>  ‚Ä¢ All main and auxiliary stages of the project are clearly visible.  Noticeable and contradictions, interference, lining. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Conveniently mark already traveled paths. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Easily complement the project, drawing new branches. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Non-uniform elements can be placed on maps: megabytes are friendly with a number of people. <br><br>  What if mindmapping is used to plan goals?  In combination with <a href="https://smartprogress.do/"><b>SmartProgress it</b></a> turns out quite effectively.  The main directions are determined on the map, and disciplining takes place with the help of the service. <br><br> <a href="https://smartprogress.do/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/623/b96/75d/623b9675d4be4ad69974a661aae30321.jpg"></a> <br><br><h6>  <b>How to build cards</b> </h6><br>  <b><i>Principles of drawing cards</i></b> <br><br>  In the center of the sheet or just above draw the central image (idea, goal, problem).  Take the first level branches (sub-ideas) from it, with associations or key concepts that slightly reveal the central image.  From branches 1 level take branches 2 levels.  If necessary, add branches 3 levels. <br><br>  <b><i>12 cards drawing tips</i></b> <br><br>  1. Include imaginative, creative thinking and associativity.  This helps the brain to approach the problem from different angles and look for an unusual but effective solution. <br>  2. Use different branch colors to separate work directions.  If this is a card with tasks for employees, mark the branches with a specific color for each project participant.  Flowers should be no more than 8, so as not to get lost.  The highest perception rate in red, yellow and orange.  The lowest - in brown, blue and green. <br>  3. The number of branches 2 and subsequent levels should not be more than 5-7. <br>  4. The map reflects the style of thinking, so do not strive to standardize it. <br>  5. Exaggerated examples are better remembered.  So feel free to draw unusual pictures. <br>  6. Drawing by hand stimulates thinking.  Despite various convenient services, do not neglect white paper and felt-tip pens. <br>  7. Make the images bright and memorable, so that they evoke emotions.  This will help the brain to work in the right direction. <br>  8. Build the structure according to the hierarchy: important concepts are closer to the center, details - further.  You can number branches if necessary. <br>  9. Less words, more pictures.  If a few words, write them in one line so that the eye does not make unnecessary movements. <br>  10. Make up your characters.  Lightning - fast, eye - control, light - important. <br>  11. First level lines draw thicker to see the importance of action.  The length of the line is equal to the length of the word.  Change the size of the letters to emphasize the importance of the branch. <br>  12. Differentiate the branches, encircling them in blocks, connect with arrows to show the relationship. <br><br><h6>  <b>Intelligence Card Services</b> </h6><br>  If you do not like to draw by hand (and very vainly!), Then choose paid or free programs for drawing maps on your computer.  They differ in design, ways of exporting images, the ability to connect To-do List, compatibility with platforms. <br>  I use the MindMeister online service.  It is combined with the Meistertask (scheduler).  Plus you can connect paid PRO-packages.  The data is stored on the cloud, so I can load maps from any laptop.  Bright, many opportunities for creativity, intuitive to manage.  Templates are, I do not know who is like, I still have enough. <br><br>  Psychologists believe that it is best to draw from the hand, maximally activating creative thinking, then you will think and solve problems much more efficiently.  And the modern rhythm of life suggests using any service you like.  Well, you decide.  But the mind map is a really cool tool, I recommend. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/312230/">https://habr.com/ru/post/312230/</a></p>
