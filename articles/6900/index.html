  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Forums and blogs - ‚Äúis there a difference between them?‚Äù</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  So I decided to try to publish the first post on Habrahabr ... Original on my main blog <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/eldar/archive/2007/04/13/661698.aspx">Thoughts that could not be kept in my head ...</a> <br><br>  When I recently drove Renata with Russian journalists on campus, one of them asked me this question.  ‚ÄúDo you think blogs are serious or just empty fashion?  I somehow look and I can not see the big differences from the forums ... " <br><br>  Well, firstly, there is a huge difference between them, but the forums themselves are not born equal, as well as blogs.  Forum forum strife.  And a blog blog.  Therefore, it is difficult to answer about these two categories, but rather you need to compare several categories of forums and several categories of blogs.  And you need to start with the fact that even large categories are not two, but at least three.  There are blogs, there are forums, and there are blogging communities - a kind of community of bloggers.

Let me explain what I call a significant difference.  Imagine a hammer and a shovel.  It can be said that they are of different shapes, lengths, that different iron is used in them, but this is all irrelevant, even if it is interesting.  The essential difference should be practical.  The common feature of a shovel and a hammer is that they both are tools, so the essential difference between them is that they dig one and the other hammer the nails.  Moreover, the fact that both the hammer and the shovel can be thrown is usually not a significant difference, since it does not stem from the basic needs of people.  So, forums and blogs are also tools and their types, subspecies, differences and similarities lie in the fact that they allow you to achieve different goals.  This is the basis for the subsequent classification. <br><br>  So let's start with the forums: <br><br>  Forum - Communal Kitchen or "Pike Vests" <br><br>  This is the most popular form of forums.  What is said on this forum usually matters only on the forum itself.  Whatever happens on it, the world will not turn over, and usually does not even scratch it.  However, like the communal kitchen, such a forum has a kind of magnetism, especially for those who lack life in real life. <br><br>  Let me rethink a childish joke about a black and black city ... It happens that a gray-gray man, having spent all day in a gray-gray office and doing his gray-gray work, returned home through the gray-gray streets of a gray-gray city in gray-gray a bus full of gray-gray people, entered the gray-gray front door and entered the gray-gray apartment along the gray-gray stairs.  He turned on his gray-gray computer, logged on to the Internet, and got to his favorite forum.  And life began to play with colors.  Here he exchanged words with a friend, complained about the fool-boss, laughed at a joke abandoned by someone, cursed one forum participant, turned out to be cursed himself, made a little war, got out of it in the confidence of his victory, criticized the president of America, condemned the actions of America and Aliens' conspiracy plans with Alpha Centauri, told everyone that ‚ÄúChamberlain is the head!‚Äù and finally slammed the door out of the forum, after which he was already tired, slammed into bed and fell asleep, feeling that the day was not in vain. <br><br>  Forum-communal cuisine is a great place for people with delusions of grandeur.  Here they can, in a society of their own kind, confirm their significance (and this does not require even the slightest basis), and at the same time take out their aggression to those who accidentally come to the forum.  And even better if the forum has developed a "two-party system", where members of each group flatter each other and take out aggression on members of the opposite group. <br><br>  Laughing with laughter, and we all need to burn adrenaline from time to time, take part in battles, get confirmation of our own significance, and neither work nor family are usually suitable for this.  So do not think that I even condemn the participation in such forums.  I only feel sorry when a person goes into such a forum with his head, when virtual battles begin to crowd out his real life, when it turns into escapism. <br><br>  The usual topics of such forums are politics, talking about everything and about nothing, and in general, all sorts of global issues from the wars in Chechnya and Iraq to bird flu and the thermal death of the Universe.  ‚ÄúHow can we (!) Arrange Russia?‚Äù Is a typical topic of such a forum. <br><br>  Forum - training ground <br><br>  And by the way, what happens in the forums, "communal kitchens" for young people is the very game in which all mammals get skills.  In this case - discussion, rhetoric, networking, social interaction, grouping, living within a group and participating in joint activities - for example, attacks on another group. <br><br>  Of course, young people usually prefer separate forums, because the pique waistcoat forums are too individualistic, and the topics are usually not the ones that worry the younger generation.  But in them more enthusiasm, veggies moderators are often included in a fun brawl, less attention to detail, and people disperse with a feeling of a good fair.  ‚ÄúA good fight was at the fair last year!‚Äù <br><br>  Dating forum <br>  Well, there's nothing to talk about.  We are all human, we are all human, we all belong to the same or the other sex, and we all need occasionally the opposite.  For those who have not solved this issue quite fundamentally, dating forums are one way to temporarily solve this problem.  And we all know that such forums exist in considerable numbers and are flourishing. <br><br>  Forum - grand salon <br>  If the previous forums were mostly anonymous, then the forum of the high society salon usually has some core, which is well acquainted with each other in real life.  People come here to hear the news, share gossip, meet someone who - who knows?  - may sometime be useful in real life, and may even affect some real events.  Gallant officers send compliments to the ladies, an official with fervor explains the new government policy, old-timers suspiciously get accustomed to the newcomer who was invited by an unknown person, and the great-society lioness on the couch behind the curtain (not right on the forum, in a personal) whispers to the governor-general: ‚ÄúAh, Denis Artemevich!  Is it really not in your power to hang (ban) this bastard bastard? ‚Äù <br><br>  Of course, I am somewhat embellished and the state affairs of countries are rarely decided on Internet forums, but I know at least one where you can throw a well-formed idea, and then hear it from the name and from the mouth of some very famous Russian journalists. <br><br>  Forum - Club of Interest <br><br>  Exchange culinary recipes;  find out where you can download the patch to the game;  clarify whether anyone knows anything about the mistress of Nero Act beyond the limits of the novel "Camo Ridge?";  You can hear the criticism of the new fashionable diet and get a firm confirmation of the creation of a person by God personally without any evolution at the forums - clubs of interest. <br><br>  If you produce goods for the mass market, then a forum on related topics can be a good marketing ploy.  Or maybe not, it depends on who will do it.  A separate kind of interest clubs - consumer clubs.  For example, a forum where you can discuss the future purchase of a car and get advice on different brands and years of release.  Or where to invest in the current market.  Such forums are often very often supported by interested firms or organizations. <br><br>  Popular forums can often justify themselves with the help of advertising, less popular topics often live at the expense of the sponsor-organizer, or due to clustering up to the size when advertising begins to work, for example, as on <a href="http://2bb.ru/">2bb.ru</a> <br><br>  Forum professional <br>  Well, and finally, another very common extreme is a professional forum.  This is a forum where you can get advice from colleagues, talk on professional topics, learn something new from work, do professional networking, and sometimes even get a job.  These are, by the way, Technet forums. <br><br>  By the way, as with Technet, they are often supported by firms involved in such professional activities.  Moreover, the support of the company does not mean large sizes.  For example, I know the forum of a company engaged in translation and localization for the Russian market in which there are not so many people, but all are professional translators, usually with very good experience. <br><br>  Other forums <br>  By the way, there are other, smaller or uninteresting categories of forums.  For example, the forum of one person, when someone wants to feel seba "king of the hill", but there is no reason for this.  However, this can hardly be called a forum, so there‚Äôs nothing to talk about here. <br><br>  Now look at this list and answer, can at least some of these goals be achieved with the help of a blog - a personal publication of a series of mini-articles with the possibility of comments from the public? <br><br>  Now, having dealt with the forums, let's move on to the blogs.  The blog revolves around one person, a kind of monarch.  But a monarch without citizens is not exactly a monarch, so the audience here is important.  Although not everyone writes blogs to be monarchs.  In general, we turn to the types of blogs. <br><br>  Blog "Why am I worse?" <br>  This type of blog makes up the vast majority of blogs on the Internet.  The man heard about the blogs and decided, and why am I worse?  Give me and I'll get myself?  If he has no other bright idea for the sake of which he will do this, then having published from one to a dozen or two posts, he will safely forget about it and the Internet will be replenished with another dead blog.  Or will remember him once a year, which in general is about the same.  If he has created a blog somewhere on LiveJournal, then during the period of enthusiasm he may ‚Äúget infected‚Äù with the theme of community blogs, but this is a completely different story. <br><br>  Again, this is exactly the 95% of blogs on the Internet, now their creation is fueled by the noise around blogs, but when it dies down, people will continue to create one-day blogs just to let off steam or simply wander to the site praising the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating such . <br><br>  By the way, if you find yourself in such a situation - here is my uninvited advice.  First, the answer to this question: no, you are no worse.  So, allow yourself a little whim, and create it, the benefit of places where you can start a free blog on the Internet at least a dime a dozen.  Windows Live Spaces, MySpace, Blogger, LJ, Wordpress.com ... I myself have five of these, with long-forgotten addresses, names and passwords.  Only, if you do not know why you need it, do not waste your precious time trying to support them.  Do you need it? <br><br>  Blog "I" <br>  Blogs associated with mild megalomania probably make up 95% of the remaining 5% of blogs on the Internet.  They are diligently supported despite the complete absence of an audience or any reasonable goal to maintain it.  Perhaps this is all that can be said about them, and obviously more than anything interesting could be said about them ... <br><br>  Asterisk Blog <br>  Well, yes, if you are a pop star, or at least a pop star, and you already have fans, a personal diary - checked by your lawyer and PR manager - this is a great move.  At least often enough.  Especially if your PR manager catches mice and does his job. <br><br>  Blog "news feed" <br>  This blog is usually done with the aim of making money.  Some even manage it.  A blog is created, paid ads like Google AdSense are inserted into it (including RSS and Atom feed), and then news is published several times a day with links to other sites on a strictly targeted topic.  Own creativity is not required.  People subscribe to your blog through the aggregator and sometimes click on ads.  They say some have managed to make money on it ... <br><br>  Current events blog - Announcements <br>  Usually such blogs are made by small firms.  From time to time, any company needs to say something to Urbi et Orbi.  Previously, a press release was made for this and sent to a bunch of services.  Actually, they still do it now.  But it costs money and time.  If you absolutely do not care, read it all sorts of journalists, politicians or not, with the same success, you can simply publish it on your "company" blog.  And even if you sent it through news agencies and a PR firm, you still need it to be available on your site, right?  A blog is an ideal medium for such publications. <br><br>  Blog - Publish <br>  Sometimes you want to publish your work on the Internet, but you don‚Äôt want to bother with a paid site or have a strange kind of free address like <a href="http://www.whoknowswhere.com/18635218329/qiwiueye/yourname">www.whoknowswhere.com/18635218329/qiwiueye/yourname</a> ... One of the big reasons not to bother with paid hosting is to continued to be available even when you forget about him.  Simply put, you want to publish and forget. <br><br>  Of course, there are sites like Samizdat in the Moshkov library or prose.ru, but who reads there?  These sites are full of authors who follow each other enviously, and if you don‚Äôt play the rules of these community communities, your work is just as inaccessible (at least difficult to detect) as if it continued to lie on your hard drive.  Where to hide a straw?  In a haystack.  This principle works on sites for the publication of their works. <br><br>  The blog is different in this sense.  You usually have a more or less reasonable address, if someone nevertheless wandered to you, he is not distracted by tons of other works, and if this is a reliable free service, then in total the package is much more attractive than the online library. <br><br>  Here is an example where I published for my brother his ‚ÄúAnthology of Fairy-tale Anecdote‚Äù in verse: &lt;a href=the <a href="http://lukomorye.blogspot.com/">lukomorye.blogspot.com</a> "class="" target="_blank" mce_href=ri <a href="http://lukomorye.blogspot.com/">lukomorye.blogspot.com</a> "&gt; http : //lukomorye.blogspot.com I can not!  I brag.  Here is a fragment from there (this is from the epilog): <br><br>  Here - Lukomorye! <br>  Everyone is free here <br>  Fly on wings with bell towers, <br>  Tear the shirt, give everything, <br>  Or drink to the mother of God, <br>  And cry bitter tears <br>  In front of oak crosses, <br>  Another pain coming <br>  And live as before, without being baptized, <br>  As long as the thunder from heaven does not fuck, <br>  Here is the Russian spirit! <br>  Here Russia smells! <br>  The only problem with using a blog for publishing is its reverse chronological order.  So it is often necessary to put fictitious data of the publication on individual posts so that they are sorted in the order you need.  And even this is not necessary - some blogs allow you to create "pages" that do not obey this rule.  Unfortunately, the most reliable hosting, do not have this opportunity - however, to put another time on the post is not such a big problem. <br><br>  Blog Draft <br>  Suppose you are working on a book.  Moreover, you are not Stephen King or Rowling, you do not care if your fans read something from your internal kitchen or the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãplot twists long before the book is finished or published.  But you need to do tons of research and not lose results.  Where to store them?  Of course, on the blog! <br><br>  By the way, in this case you don‚Äôt really care that your blog has no readers.  This is essentially your personal diary with personal notes.  You just don't care if anyone reads it.  But your records are available to you everywhere where there is Internet.  Not bad, right? <br><br>  A hybrid of blog publishing and draft blog is a blog that is used to publish new chapters as they are written.  By the way, in fact, why not? <br><br>  Blog safety valve <br>  Is your boss an idiot?  As far as I know the corporate world, that in America, in Russia, with a probability of 70-80%, you answered this question ‚ÄúYes!‚Äù However, it is hardly a good idea to tell this news to him, right?  But I want to let off steam.  And where to do it, if not on the blog?  Not everyone is torturing his wife. <br><br>  Of course, you were so sensible to make this blog anonymous, and not to mention specific names, because otherwise it could easily end very badly.  So, what is next?  Do you care if someone reads it or not?  Of course not.  Do you care that he is not in the Top 100 rating?  Not really.  Rather, you would be excited if he entered. <br><br>  By the way, the boss is not the only person who can make you mad.  Spouse, children, parents, friends, colleagues, classmates, doctor, insurance agent ... The list is almost endless. <br><br>  By the way, digressing, did you hear the legend about King Midas and his donkey ears?  In Midas, as a result of some misunderstanding with the native gods and strange artifacts, donkey ears have grown.  This fact, he, of course, found it necessary to hide, but - that's bad luck - his hair continued to grow and he had to call on the barber.  The magician was explained civilized, or you are silent about the king's donkey ears, or ... The magician caught the quick-witted and did not say to any living soul.  But not being able to fight the temptation, he went out of the city, dug a hole, and said: ‚ÄúKing Midas has donkey ears!‚Äù Fife, and Fife began to play: "King Midas has donkey ears!" In general, the secret could not be hidden.  So, this blog plays the role of the very pit.  For losers with the same effect. <br><br>  Blog "Insider" <br>  The person allegedly has information that others do not have.  What does this mean?  That he will have readers.  Of course, if this potential information interests someone.  Already good. <br><br>  True, there is another question, but why is this something for him?  There may be different answers.  For example, if he was asked to do this.  Or he wants to create a reputation for himself (see the next category), which could later be used to ... well, I don‚Äôt know, find a new job;  find new friends;  find new opportunities-opportunities;  just be able to demand more for their services if he is in consulting ... Reputation is a vague thing, but known for its ability to increase the income of its owner.  Or is it just in his job description and duties.  Or he just itches, even if at work they give him over the ears.  Or ... well, there are many reasons.  But the essence is one, such blogs exist, and there are also quite a few such blogs. <br><br>  By the way, most Microsoft employee blogs fall into this category. <br><br>  Reputation Blog <br><br>  It so happens that a person wants to move to another area of ‚Äã‚Äãwork and knowledge, but ... alas! .. without reputation it is almost impossible.  How to create it?  This requires a lot, but a blog - as one of the elements of the equation - is in many cases appropriate.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Or maybe he does not even want to move to another area of ‚Äã‚Äãknowledge, but just wants a big salary, for this reputation is also useful. Or he just wants people to catch his every word ... do not ask me why.</font></font><br><br>        ‚Äì   ,       ,      .   :      .       ,   ,     .       ¬´   ¬ª,      - ,         ,     ,    , ,        ,     .       ‚Äì  ,  .   ‚Äì   . <br><br> , ,     ,      ,        ,     . ,  . <br><br>  ‚Äì   <br>    ,         .    , ‚Ä¶  ,  ‚Ä¶ <br><br> ,  ,   ,   ,      !  ?     .    ,       .    ‚Äì    ,          ,    .    ,    :-) <br><br> ,    ‚Äì  .       ,    ,    .                           ‚Ä¶ <br><br> ,         guru.com  freelancer.com,         ¬´ 50        ¬ª,        600-700 .                ,     ,   .
