You can order this assessment for an advertising campaign.  The system issues an Excel file with estimates for each phrase and total estimates for the whole of the Republic of Kazakhstan.  As a result, you can see what disadvantages an advertising campaign has.  For example, in the headline, ad text or in quick links there are few words from the key phrase, the link is irrelevant, there are no negative words, the landing page is loaded for a long time, the landing page has a high failure rate.  For each phrase, a rating is given (from ‚Äúbad‚Äù to ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù).  The system even offers its own version of the relevant landing page from the same site.  For the campaign, two estimates are given: taking into account and without taking into account the significance of individual phrases.  Consideration of significance means the following: the greater the proportion of the phrase in the clicks and expenses of the campaign, the more it affects the total estimate for the campaign.  This is correct: if the lion's share of expenses falls on 2-3 low-quality phrases, then a few hundred quality ads that nobody clicks will not save the situation. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/1dd/41f/769/1dd41f769c324c6dab7dbb0eb7b743f2.jpg"><br></p><p><br>  The disadvantage of the quality assessment from the R-broker is that there is little explanation in the report file, which means each column.  True, in the "Frequently Asked Questions" section I managed to find more detailed explanations.  But I would like to get all the information in the file with the report, and not to look for it myself. <br>  <strong>Calculate R-max by CPC or CPO / CPA</strong> <br>  Another interesting functionality of the R-broker is ‚ÄúCalculation of R-max by CPC‚Äù.  Often it is necessary to solve this problem.  It is necessary that the cost of a click (CPC) is close to the specified value.  What rate to set to achieve just such a cost per click?  If you set a high bid, the clicks will be too expensive.  If you set a low bid, we will buy cheap clicks, but there will be too few clicks, the traffic plan will not be fulfilled.  Direct does not answer the question about the optimal rate, but ‚ÄúCalculation of R-max by CPC‚Äù answers this question.  You can select a bid that will provide the desired CPC.  The system also gives a forecast of how many clicks will be received at this price.  If it turns out that the clicks are too few, you can adjust the CPC and get a new recommendation on the rate. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/344/9b4/54a/3449b454a02841c38c51968d8559bf74.png"><br></p><p><br>  Similarly, you can choose the rate (R-max), which provides the desired order value (CPO) or cost to achieve the selected goal (CPA).  R-broker indicates in the forecast the number of orders (or achieved goals), which will be received at this rate. <br>  <strong>CPC or CPA / CPO auto management</strong> <br>  You can set bids in campaigns according to the recommendations of R-broker.  But the real situation in Direkt varies daily.  Therefore, the forecast of the R-broker needs to be adjusted all the time, after which the rates change.  In order not to waste time on this monotonous work, you can put the campaign on automatic control.  Then the R-broker will adjust the rates in Direct itself to ensure the assigned value of CPC or CPA / CPO. <br>  <strong>Projects</strong> <br>  A convenient tool for working with campaigns in R-broker - projects.  You can combine several campaigns into one project and manage these campaigns as if they were all combined into one campaign.  For example, you can create a set of segments, set bids for a project.  If you need to manage hundreds of campaigns at once, this is very convenient.  No need to repeat the same routine operations hundreds of times. <br>  <strong>Individual tactics</strong> <br>  In the R-broker you can use standard tactics of the type "Only the 3rd position in special placement".  But many specialists in contextual advertising is not enough.  Need more sophisticated tactics.  For example, if the deductible price for entering a special placement exceeded a certain threshold, you need to assign a rate to enter the 1st place in the dynamics.  If the price of entering the special accommodation below the specified threshold, you need to select a different rate.  Such tactics can be created using the functionality for creating individual tactics available in the R-broker.  To create tactics there is a handy "Calculator".  You can create quite complex conditions using the operators AND and OR, as well as the various rates available in the calculator.  In addition to the rates and write-off prices of different positions, you can use such elements as "current bid", "past bid", "current write-off price", "past write-off price" when creating tactics. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/fde/99e/4a7/fde99e4a71844c54997292691c1839b4.png"><br></p><p><br>  <strong>Segments</strong> <br>  In one campaign there are many phrases with different indicators.  There are effective phrases with low order costs and a large number of conversions.  There are clearly ineffective phrases that have been clicked a lot, but have not ordered anything.  There are "doubtful" phrases that did not bring orders, but little statistics was accumulated on them, so it is not known what to expect from them.  Some may be effective, while others may not.  Obviously, you should not assign the same rates to all these phrases.  Therefore, different categories of phrases should be assigned different tactics.  The composition of these categories changes daily as phrases move from one category to another as statistics accumulate.  But in the R-broker you do not need to manually categorize phrases.  For this there is a functional "Segments".  The user can create several segments, set up conditions for each segment (for example, more than 3 phrase transactions over the past 90 days with an order value less than 1000 rubles). You can assign a bet or a tactic for each segment.  After each update of statistics, the R-broker checks the conditions of the segments and, if necessary, transfers the phrase to another segment. </p><br></li></ul></li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/329812/">https://habr.com/ru/post/329812/</a></p>
