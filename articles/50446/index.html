  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Experience using Nokia N79</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In this article I want to tell my experience of setting up a smartphone for themselves, in this case the Nokia N79. <br>  So, imagine that our smart is just after a hard reset.  It is empty and waiting for the installation of any applications. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  First you need to make a certificate for our device.  What for?  N79 is quite a new phone, so there are no methods for its hacking and access to the hidden file system. <br>  So, in order to use many programs, they need to be signed, after ordering a certificate on our phone. <br>  <a href="http://dimonvideo.ru/articles/745">http://dimonvideo.ru/articles/745</a> <br><br>  Here is a list of my programs: <br>  <b>Btswitch</b> <br>  Putting the icon of this application on the desktop, switch Bluetooth on / off with one click. <br>  <b>Coreplayer</b> <br>  There are many other players, with free ones.  But in terms of speed I like this one the most. <br>  <b>Flipsilent</b> <br>  An interesting thing.  Allows you to cut down the alarm / call, simply turning the phone screen down. <br>  <b>Freedialhelper</b> <br>  Search and display contacts when dialing.  Analog from HandyShell <br> <a href="http://piccy.info/view/c4d564a1d7e3b8cb56ede70cc0944a1e/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/62f/c24/3aa/62fc243aaf07c690e99aeb2e53c3d137.jpg" alt="Piccy.info - Free Image Hosting"></a> <br>  <b>GarminMobileXT</b> <br>  Good gps navigation program.  Used vector maps. <br>  <b>Gmail</b> <br>  No comments :) <br>  <b>GoogleMaps</b> <br>  Similarly. <br>  <b>Handytaskman</b> <br>  Process manager  There are others, with free and steeper opportunities.  But I really liked this one.  Simple and at the same time everything is there. <br>  <b>OperaMini</b> <br>  Legendary browser.  Super! <br>  <b>ProfileSheulder</b> <br>  We switch profiles on time.  Very comfortably. <br>  <b>QIP</b> <br>  icq client  Others have not experienced - this suits. <br>  <b>RescoPhotoViewer</b> <br>  Mandatory thing on smart.  Compared with the standard card viewer, this is heaven and earth.  I highly recommend! <br>  <b>SymSMB</b> <br>  Long thought how to shower files on smart.  The cable, the memory card is long and requires extra action, but a lot of speed.  Bluetooth is simpler, but the speed is low.  This program implements SMB, a full-fledged file server on a smart.  Communication via Wi-Fi, so the speed is high. <br>  <b>SymTorrent</b> <br>  We download torrents at night from the phone :) <br>  <b>X-plore</b> <br>  Excellent file manager <br><br>  This list is not complete, I am constantly looking for something new for my smart, and I am trying to make it even better) <br>  On my desktop I have icons of the most used applications.  Also, some of these applications are in the Hnady Taskman, in the favorites tab. <br> <a href="http://piccy.info/view/6c992a25e147ecbf5dab7ab114b26285/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/36c/708/de9/36c708de9abbe15c93091a1799ae17d1.jpg" alt="Piccy.info - Free Image Hosting"></a>

      I also reorganized the main menu.  This is how it looks like: <br> <a href="http://piccy.info/view/f8efe6defc7d3b5762f64f73e4162d74/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a90/e8c/671/a90e8c671154a0c458fd4bc108ff05ee.jpg" alt="Piccy.info - Free Image Hosting"></a> <br><br>  Now I want to write about the device itself. <br>  Frankly, I am very glad that I stopped at this model.  There is everything! <br>  It is especially good when there is a Wi-Fi router and unlimited internet at home. <br>  Recently released firmware 11.049.  There are a lot of changes, and all the bugs I personally found after the flashing were gone. <br>  Glory to the developers! <br><br>  <b>Appearance:</b> <br>  For a month of use, the phone has retained its presentation, which makes me happy.  The film from the screen did not take off - it does not come off and does not interfere. <br>  <b>Assembly:</b> <br>  The assembly is quite normal.  Is that just lyuftit edging under the metal and the back cover.  Backlash backlash is eliminated by adjusting the paper.  The truth is unpleasant to do this in such a fairly expensive machine. <br>  <b>Convenience:</b> <br>  I agree, externally, the clave does not look very comfortable.  I would not say that this is an ideal keyboard, but it suits me perfectly, there are no false presses.  Unless not the most convenient buttons *, 0, # - it is heavy to press them. <br>  I want to mention nav.  button and sensor Navi Wheel - in this particular model it is implemented perfectly!  Especially convenient in the player to scroll through the songs.  Did someone talk about uncomfortable software and hang up / receive buttons?  They are very comfortable, get used to everything in 1 day. <br>  I also like the keyboard lock slider - simple and practical. <br>  In general, in this regard, the phone is commendable. <br><br>  <b>Communications:</b> <br>  Bluetooth, gps, wi-fi works flawlessly.  No problems so far, pah-pah, was not. <br>  <b>Camera:</b> <br>  The camera gives quite good pictures, and the subsequent increase in the quality of the cameras in the phones is the growth of megapixels. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion:</b> <br>  I already had a bad experience using a smartphone - Nokia 6681. When I bought it, I played for a week - I realized that it was not mine, and I sold it.  This is my second attempt, and I can say with confidence that it is successful! <br>  N79 can only be compared with N82 and N85.  First wins in many ways, except for the camera flash and 3d-accelerator. <br>  N85 I thought to take first.  But upset the build quality, which Nokia has dropped a lot lately ... <br>  So if you are a technomaniac, or just look for a reliable, most functional phone, your choice is N79. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/50446/">https://habr.com/ru/post/50446/</a></p>
