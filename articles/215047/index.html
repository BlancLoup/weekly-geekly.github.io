  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Unusual way to get your passport data by hosting</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The famous phrase about ‚Äúneed more gold‚Äù in application to current IT companies is time to rethink ‚Äúneed more information‚Äù.  Hands are drawn to everything: your numbers, mailboxes, SMS, private messages, history of visited sites.  I was struck three years ago by the story that some payment column operators quietly added new items to their public offers: the number to which the payment is credited becomes a member of the advertising mailing base.  A rare case of rectilinear picking up personal data I thought.  Then I ran into the fact that every taxi call provides you with spam for a month.  I read on the Internet that taxi companies consider that you signed a public offer with them with your order, how interesting it is.  All the described and not described schemes assume that you gave the data yourself after all.  The new scheme is struggling with people who do not want to enter their data anywhere.  I'll tell the story on the example of 1bit.ru *, but something prompts me that many behave. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Immediately after selecting the hosting options, the user is offered 2 weeks of free hosting.  You can use this by entering the mailbox and login.  Then they offer you to pay the bill.  You pay and get what you want.  After that, an unexpected message comes with threats: <br><br><blockquote>  Your account works with a service agreement, <br>  which operates in the mode of a public offer. <br>  To continue the provision of services in this mode <br>  fill in legal and contact information <br>  about the owner of the account. </blockquote><br><br>  I called the operator and asked why it worked for two weeks, the bill was issued without problems, the system did not create any obstacles for me and then the extortion began.  I was told about a free domain, which can be registered according to data that has not been entered, and that if there are complaints about my resource, I will not be able to assert my rights.  Having said that the resource will be only for me and the domain is not needed amicably parted. <br>  Less than a week, as the letter repeated.  During the correspondence, I asked to confirm the following position: <br><blockquote>  Please confirm that you consider it normal to issue an account and receive money into your account under a contract that you do not consider to be a prisoner correctly and for which you do not consider you obligated to do something.  Obligatory fields in the interface before invoicing expose yourself. </blockquote><br>  To which the head Dmitry disappeared the signature, and the radius of blurring of meaning was injured: <br><blockquote>  We consider it normal to accept funds at any time.  At the same time, to work with us, it is necessary to fill in information about the account holder. </blockquote><br>  The fact of the work of an illiterate lawyer was also recorded.  The guys from 1bit believe that the phrase <br><blockquote>  Provide timely, at the request of the Contractor, reliable information necessary for the execution of the Agreement. </blockquote><br>  I have to make them an information slave and a hint that they have to prove that the information on the passport is ‚Äúnecessary for the execution of the Treaty‚Äù, they were upset and they no longer communicate. <br>  In addition to the fact that the hoster deliberately postpones the requirement of a passport, parting the client for payment, it is also funny that the return of money back to tataaaam!  only on the passport. <br>  Take care of your data as bequeathed by Satoshi.  : D
