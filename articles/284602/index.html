The end of such surprises put the Federal Antimonopoly Service.  The ministry found that the Big Three operators not only inflated roaming prices, but also deliberately did not inform subscribers about tariff changes.  Simply put, a person traveling abroad is confident that communication services with zero balance will not be provided.  But abroad, calls for calls start to be removed with a delay of several days.  As a result, often after returning home, subscribers find a debt of several thousand rubles, and when using the mobile Internet - even several hundred thousand.  The antimonopoly service has already issued recommendations: those who have encountered such a problem need to make a complaint to the operators.  A written application must be accompanied by a copy of the contract.  If the operator rejected or ignored the claim, the subscriber can safely go to court.  The main thing is not to pull - six months after the provision of the service, you will not be able to sue anything. <br>  <a href="http://www.fas.gov.ru/fas-in-press/fas-in-press_31846.html">www.fas.gov.ru/fas-in-press/fas-in-press_31846.html</a> </blockquote><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h6>  Fontanka: </h6><blockquote>  According to the FAS, thus, operators unilaterally unilaterally changed the essential condition of the agreement on the procedure of payments for services, which ultimately infringed the interests of subscribers.  The decision on the illegality of such actions was taken last fall.  And at the end of February, the FAS‚Äôs conclusions were actually confirmed by the court: in Vladimir, the claim of Megafon against the newlyweds, who had ‚Äúpressed‚Äù more than a million rubles in Greece, was rejected.  This case has received a wide public response - even the Vice-Speaker of the State Duma interceded for victims who wanted to download TV shows via a 3G modem.  The district court concluded that the company did not inform subscribers about the change in the payment system, which led to the emergence of huge debts.

      The Antimonopoly Service believes that due to the lack of this information there is a need to pay for services that were not planned to be received, which is a violation of their rights.  And because the subscriber is entitled to return the appropriate amount.  To do this, you must first submit a claim, for which the operator has two months to consider: ‚ÄúIf the claim is rejected in full or in part or the response is not received within the deadlines set for its consideration, the subscriber has the right to sue in court, taking into account the <a href="http://www.fas.gov.ru/solutions/solutions_31513.html">decision of the FAS Russia</a> ,‚Äù explains the antimonopoly service . <br><br>  Those who wish to return the money must be remembered that under the current law, the claim must be submitted only within six months from the day the service is provided.  In addition, it is necessary to attach a copy of the contract to it - there are already cases where the operator formally legally ignored the subscriber's reasonable demands only because of the incorrect execution of his claim. <br>  <a href="http://www.fontanka.ru/2011/03/09/062/">www.fontanka.ru/2011/03/09/062</a> <br></blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/284602/">https://habr.com/ru/post/284602/</a></p>
