What to do in this case?  Listen to these tips. <br><br>  <b>1. Test text elements on the site.</b>  They really matter.  A good headline can attract attention and ‚Äúhook‚Äù the visitor on the hook.  And words like ‚Äúfree‚Äù, ‚Äúcheaper‚Äù can increase conversion (and they can reduce it).  In one A / B test, the text ‚ÄúStart my free trial‚Äù converted the CTA button better than ‚ÄúStart your free trial‚Äù.  And the difference is only in one pronoun. <br>  Text testing cases can be found <a href="http://boosta.ru/ab-testirovanie/cases/8-realnyih-primerov-ab-testirovaniya-teksta/">here</a> .

      <b>2. All tests and changes on the site should occur on the basis of <a href="http://boosta.ru/web-analytics/oni-pomogut-najti-vsex-ubijc-konversii-10-otchyotov-v-google-analytics/">quantitative</a> (Google Analytics, Yandex.Metrica) and / or <a href="http://boosta.ru/ab-testirovanie/ideas/kak-najti-ideyu-dlya-av-testa-teplovye-karty-i-oprosy/">qualitative</a> analysis (polls, communication with the target audience).</b>  Tests based on data are more likely to succeed.  And every failed test is a waste of time and a missed opportunity. <br><br>  <b>3. Be patient with A / B testing.</b>  The fact that the statistical validity in the experiment exceeded 95% does not mean anything.  How many tests <a href="http://boosta.ru/ab-testirovanie/mistakes/eti-17-oshibok-poxoronyat-vash-ab-test/">were ruined by the</a> fact that people simply focused on this indicator (although most do not even know about it). <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>4. The color of key elements matters.</b>  But not in the sense that some colors convert better, while others worse.  They matter in the context of the page.  The colors of the most important elements (for example, buttons, forms) should be ‚Äúat the top‚Äù of the visual hierarchy on the page.  Evidence <a href="http://boosta.ru/ab-testirovanie/cases/kakoy-tsvet-luchshe-vliyaet-na-konversiyu/">here</a> <br><br>  <b>5. Not all people read the texts (headings, subheadings, descriptions) on the site.</b>  Many prefer <a href="http://boosta.ru/ab-testirovanie/advice/kak-uvelichit-konversiyu-sajta-s-pomoshhyu-izobrazhenij-6-sposobov/">visual content</a> - images, video, audio.  You need to understand how it is most convenient for a visitor to consume information.  If you need a video, you can make an animated explener, if you need to show the product "face", then you need more real images of the goods "in action". <br><br>  <b>6. Short Landings do not convert better than long ones</b> .  Long landing pages do not convert better than short ones.  It all depends on the product, price, novelty and other factors.  If you are promoting a simple product with a low cost, and the visitor knows how it works and what it needs, then a short landing page is the best option (for sure).  If you are promoting an expensive and complex product, then the visitor needs to explain why it is needed, how it works and why it is so expensive.  In this case, additional texts do not interfere. <br><br>  <b>7. In the forms for registration, sending the application do not ask for too much information</b> .  If you only have enough user mail, you do not need to ask for a phone number and name.  Do not load it at the first stage of the sales funnel.  Postpone it for later, after registration.  If now in your site in the form of many fields, then consider each of them - why is it?  What does it give you?  If you remove it, how will this affect business processes?  If nothing changes, feel free to clean.  As a rule, removing extra fields increases the conversion.  It is obvious that visitors do not like big forms. <br><br>  Article in the topic - <a href="http://boosta.ru/ab-testirovanie/cases/10-uspeshnyx-kejsov-ab-testirovaniya/">10 successful cases A / B testing</a> <br><br>  <b>8. Social proofs (reviews, logos of well-known clients, media references, number of clients, product ratings, etc.) matter and most often have a positive effect on conversion.</b>  Another thing is that now most of the social evidence has become absolutely the same and users trust them less and less.  So look for opportunities to stand out.  For example, video reviews use very few. <br><br>  <b>9. Security icons affect the level of trust on the part of a potential customer</b> .  If you give any guarantees (30 days of refund or free exchange of goods), then write about it at the stages of decision making (just before purchase, for example).  At the decision-making stage, the potential client is in dire need of support and incentives for action. <br><br>  <b>10. Always <a href="http://boosta.ru/ab-testirovanie/mistakes/samaya-bolshaya-oshibka-v-ab-testirovanii/">measure macroconversions</a> with microconversions</b> .  The increase in conversion at one of the stages of the sales funnel is, no doubt, cool.  But it is necessary to analyze how this affects other goals in the sales funnel, and especially on the last goal (purchase, registration, download, etc.).  When analyzing the impact on other targets, do not forget to recalculate the statistical confidence indicator and the sample size. <br><br>  <b>11. Do not rely entirely on others experience.</b>  If something works for one company, it‚Äôs not a fact that it will work for you.  Each site has its own target audience.  Each site has its own user interaction process.  So adapt to your visitors, and not blindly copy other people's examples. <br><br>  The article in the topic - <a href="http://boosta.ru/ab-testirovanie/mistakes/eti-17-oshibok-poxoronyat-vash-ab-test/">These 17 errors "bury" your A / B test</a> <br><br>  <b>12. Small changes rarely lead to large increases in conversion.</b>  With the help of small changes it is difficult to greatly influence the process of user interaction with the site.  Therefore, try to make <a href="http://boosta.ru/ab-testirovanie/cases/6-kejsov-uvelicheniya-konversii-ot-kompanii-fiverr/">serious experiments</a> with significant changes.  Instead of changing the color of the button, try to make a completely different landing page with a different UTP (Unique Trading Offer) and other elements.  Instead of text on the first screen, try a short and fascinating video about the product. <br><br>  <b>13. During the <a href="http://boosta.ru/ab-testirovanie-what-is-it/">A / B tests,</a> do not forget about the basic rules: at least 7 days (all days of the week, because users behave differently on Monday and Saturday), at least 95% statistical confidence, a sufficient number of conversions (take using <a href="http://hungrysites.ru/ab">this calculator</a> ).</b>  All three rules must be respected at the same time.  If one is not respected, then it is impossible to summarize the experiment. <br><br>  <b>14. When analyzing the results of the A / B test, segment the audience.</b>  New and returning users behave differently on the site.  Users of computers and mobile devices have a different experience of interaction with the site.  Accordingly, the results of the experiment can vary greatly for these segments. <br><br>  <b>15. Perform <a href="http://boosta.ru/optimizatsiya-konversii/polzovatelskoe-testirovanie-osnova-uspeshnogo-ab-eksperimenta/">user testing</a> .</b>  This will make it possible to understand how the target audience interacts with the site.  You objectively evaluate your site, and only a glance from the side will allow you to find real problems and weaknesses.  About user testing a lot of guys write from Userpoint.ru and Askusers.ru in their blogs. <br><br>  <i>Article in the topic - <a href="http://boosta.ru/services/user-experience/">Review of services for user testing</a></i> <br><br>  <b>16. Use web viewer, click cards and scrolling to analyze user actions.</b>  Along with user testing, these tools will tell you where a site visitor clicks, how deeply they scroll through the page, and how they generally interact with the site.  (This can be done absolutely free in Yandex.Metrica) <br><br>  <b>17. Do not provide too many choices.</b>  The more CTA buttons on the site, the more difficult it is to concentrate the visitor‚Äôs attention on one or the other.  Ideally, landing should have one target action (CTA button, form, for example) <br><br>  <i>Article in the topic - <a href="http://boosta.ru/ab-testirovanie/cases/startap-plotguru-podnyal-konversiyu-lendinga-s-9-do-52-a-vam-slabo/">Startup Plotguru raised the landing page conversion from 9 to 52%.</a></i>  <i><a href="http://boosta.ru/ab-testirovanie/cases/startap-plotguru-podnyal-konversiyu-lendinga-s-9-do-52-a-vam-slabo/">Are you weak?</a></i> <br><br>  <b>18. <a href="http://boosta.ru/ab-testirovanie/cases/povyshenie-konversii-s-pomoshhyu-nebolshix-izmenenij-mif-ili-realnost/">The text of the CTA button</a> must match the result of the action.</b>  If in the online store in the product catalog, the ‚ÄúBuy‚Äù button hangs near each product, although when you click a product it is added to the basket, then it should have a corresponding name - ‚ÄúAdd to basket‚Äù.  Standard buttons "Confirm", "Receive" and the like are not the most effective options. <br><br>  <b>19. Try to conduct A / B tests instead of Multivariate tests.</b>  For the latter, you need a lot of traffic and conversions.  If not, you will not get reliable results.  This is especially true for most sites of the CIS. <br><br>  <b>20. Visual content (images, video) solves.</b>  Most people are visuals.  Visual information is easier to read and better remembered.  These are proven facts.  That is why now the sites focus on high-quality (not stock) images and fascinating videos (for example, expliners) <br><br>  <b>21. You need to test not only websites, but also E-mail newsletters, ads in Google Adwords, Yandex.Direct and on Facebook.</b>  An integrated approach to optimizing conversion at all stages will maximize the use of the marketing budget. <br><br>  <i>Article in the topic - <a href="http://boosta.ru/ab-testirovanie/advice/otvety-na-20-samyx-rasprostranennyx-voprosov-po-ab-testirovaniyu/">Answers to the 20 most common questions on A / B testing</a></i> <br><br>  <b>22. If the site does not look the best way, it does not mean that it converts poorly</b> .  There are so many sites that have not the most modern design, but high conversion. <br><br>  <b>23. Use exit-intent pop-ups for those users who leave your site</b> .  And do not forget to "put" in this pop-up something valuable for the visitor - a discount, a promo code or something like that with a limited time of action.  Part of the outgoing users will be able to envelope in this way.  <a href="http://boosta.ru/various/vas-razdrazhayut-vyletayushhie-pop-apy-kogda-xotite-zakryt-sajt/">Cases are here.</a> <br><br>  <b>24. Use graphic pointers (arrows) to attract and direct the user's attention to a specific element of the page.</b>  As a rule, visitors browse the page inconsistently, and the arrows in this case can be very effective. <br><br>  <b>25. If you drive traffic to the site through paid advertising, then check whether the headlines and text of advertisements match the content that is posted on the landing page.</b>  If the ad you say about one thing, and the page contains completely different information, then you will not meet the expectations of users. <br><br>  <b>26. In the case of online stores, allow the user to place an order without registering.</b>  Bestbuy company at one time it <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item%3Fid%3D434510">brought</a> an additional $ 300 million.  And yes, these are real numbers.  And, of course, visitors do not like all these forms of registration.  The easier it is to place an order, the better. <br><br>  <b>27. Use online chat rooms on the site.</b>  When properly configured, they really work and help convert visitors into buyers.  Especially the use of online chat is relevant at the stages of decision making.  For example, in the process of payment, a potential client may have a question, the answer to which is not on the page.  In this situation, the sales consultant directly on this page in the online chat can answer the question and dispel the last doubts before buying. <br><br>  <i>Article in topic - <a href="http://boosta.ru/various/onlajn-konsultant-kak-sposob-uvelicheniya-konversii-na-sajte/">Online consultant as a way to increase conversion on the site</a></i> <br><br>  <b>28. If you use a long landing page, then place the STA buttons and order forms throughout the entire page - at the beginning, in the middle and at the end.</b>  Because different customers come to this page for readiness to purchase.  Accordingly, they need less time and information to make a decision.  And for someone it's the opposite.  Therefore, optimize the site for all segments of visitors. <br><br>  <b>29. Optimize the download speed of the site.</b>  The longer the site loads, the more likely it is that the visitor closes it.  According to some reports, every additional second of loading reduces conversion by 7%.  Check the download speed of the site and get optimization tips <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/%3Fhl%3Dru">here</a> . <br><br>  <b>30. Make delivery of goods free, even if it increases your costs.</b>  Free delivery of goods is one of the important factors that affect the decision to purchase in the online store.  If you have such an opportunity, be sure to use it. <br><br>  Prepared by the blog <a href="http://boosta.ru/">Boosta.ru</a> and the project <a href="http://www.changeagain.me/ru/">Changeagain.me</a> <br><br>  Read also our other popular articles: <br><br>  1. <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/changeagain/blog/19126/">They will help you find all the ‚Äúkillers‚Äù of the conversion - 10 reports in Google Analytics</a> (5000+ views) <br>  2. <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/changeagain/blog/19542/">100 ideas for A / B testing.</a>  <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/changeagain/blog/19542/">Part One</a> (2000+ views) <br>  3. <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/changeagain/blog/19548/">100 ideas for A / B testing: Part Two</a> (1000+ views) <br>  4. <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/changeagain/blog/19686/">How to find an idea for an A / B test: heat maps and polls</a> (1000+ views) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296282/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296282/</a></p>
