  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why you should not completely trust the lists of the most-most or statistics stubborn thing</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In a Twitter subscription, I was always more concerned not with the quantity, but with the quality of the subscriptions.  Therefore, the number of subscribers of any character worried me a little, except that very little.  This is who the person subscribes to, has always been of paramount importance to me.  If you are interested in a certain character, and his authority in your eyes is very great, then the people on whom he is signed should be of perhaps more interest to you.  Since you agree with the authority of the character, then the opinion of those people on whom he is signed is confirmed by him.  Of course, because if a person is signed up for someone, he, by definition, considers him at least equal to himself.  Sometimes even surpassing a loved one in anything.  Is it logical  After all, no one subscribes to a person whose opinion does not matter to you. <br><blockquote>  <a href="http://microventures.com/education/10-twitter-accounts-follow-startup-investor" title="10 twitter accounts of start-up investors for which you need to subscribe">The 10 twitter accounts you should follow as a startup investor</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3040236/twenty-must-follow-venture-capitalist-twitter-accounts" title="18 mandatory subscription venture capitalists accounts">18 must-follow venture capitalist twitter accounts</a> <br>  <a href="http://mashable.com/2011/10/18/twitter-startup-investors/" title="9 accounts startup investors required to subscribe">9 Twitter Accounts Every Startup Investor Should Follow</a> </blockquote><br>  Some people, when they see articles of such a plan, subscribe en masse to everything.  Others begin to choose.  Since I am <s>not</s> lucky enough to be an engineer, I chose a completely different approach to business, according to my mentality and education.  I am disgusted with the stupid subscription approach at all, then in such a mess this tape that you will not understand, and in general, it is not clear who makes these lists, and from what prerequisites it comes, etc.  Maybe someone forgot to write on this list, and maybe someone over there? <br><br>  What can be done with this? <br>  You can manually check each.  Consciousness of the engineer is modulated by logic, precise methods and what to hide with laziness.  As a result, I developed my own approach.  He is new, he seems to have invented himself, but I can‚Äôt vouch that no one like me had suffered before. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  For a start, out of the three lists, I chose nine people, almost by scientific method.  After that, using statistical services sharpened under Twitter, obtained the following data: <br><blockquote>  Statistical services: <br>  <a href="https://followerwonk.com/">followerwonk</a> <br>  <a href="http://twittercounter.com/">twittercounter</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.tweetstats.com/">tweetstats</a> </blockquote>

After comparing accounts turned out: <br><br><h4>  1. Mark Cuban, Chris Sacca, Kevin Rose - 19 General Subscriptions </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f81/d51/c3b/f81d51c3bece4c8ab1001e678455f3de.jpg" alt="one"><br><h4>  2. Marc Andreessen, Fred Wilson, Reid Hoffman - 91 total subscription </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a2e/34e/933/a2e34e93342e42709dbec9b0f65a3a7a.jpg" alt="2"><br><h4>  3. Brad Feld, John Doerr, Chris Dixon - 50 General Subscriptions </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8b7/146/c84/8b7146c84383458e8ff40f2297794ee5.jpg" alt="3"><br><br>  At once I will make a reservation that because of the unequal number of general subscriptions, the list was to a lesser number.  After analyzing the links, we got the following scheme: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/24e/425/e94/24e425e9477943509b87e34cf52456a3.png" alt="one"><br><br>  Next, we analyze the statistical data of accounts.  On the basis of the data obtained by the left answers and retweets, we trace the relationship between the participants in this study.  The users who are lit only in one observed account are rejected.  The result is already reflected in this scheme: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e54/343/252/e543432522164732b6109d09e544ea9c.png" alt="2"><br><br>  As you can see, in the first case, the groups of participants were covered by several links, and the names that were found once within the group were rejected.  The absolute link was <a href="https://twitter.com/markpinc">Mark Pincus</a> , which was not in any of the proposed list of articles.  We check the semantics, and voila, it turns out to be Mark, one of the founders of Zynga, as well as Freeloader Inc., Tribe Networks and Support.com, although, it seems, not VC.  Here you have the first candidate for must-follow.  Applause in the studio! <br><br>  In the second case, the situation is somewhat different.  The sample is limited to the statistical capabilities of the <a href="http://www.tweetstats.com/">service</a> .  Displays a total of 10 responding and retwelling users.  Here, Fred Wilson and Kevin Rose became the absolute leaders in connectivity, while Reid Hoffman and Mark Cuban were out of business.  The record holder was <a href="https://twitter.com/garyvee">Gary Vaynerchuk</a> .  Since he is not one of the VCs, the result can be ignored, and Fred and Kevin should be recorded as a must-follow, but having figured out in more detail who he is, we also put him on this list. <br><br>  As a result of the study, 2 participants and 2 outsiders are listed as must-follow.  Of course, I know that during the study I made some serious simplifications, but for the first pancake, I think this one is quite edible.  I hope that drew some attention to statistical methods.  Not so she is really boring in fact these statistics! <br><br>  Once again, applause in the studio and thank you for your attention! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/286016/">https://habr.com/ru/post/286016/</a></p>
