For example, in <i>Moscow, a</i> huge number of organizations.  They open, close, move.  The overwhelming number of places belong to the category "where you have to go only once."  Therefore, in systems that provide cartographic and reference information, users in <i>Moscow</i> use navigation more often than search services.  In the regions, the situation is reversed.  Users know the city well enough and more often look for services rather than a specific address. <br><br>  To better understand the basic usage scenarios, I have compiled a Use-case diagram: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dc4/449/cd6/dc4449cd655b4a3ebd45ab9ad0f2b347.png"><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Find an object on the map.</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Short description.

How do you think you can develop a product development strategy for 6-12 months in advance?</b>  <b>How will you make decisions - which opportunities to implement and which not?</b> <br><br>  First you need to identify trends in this area.  Analyze where competitors are moving.  For example, for the <b>COMPANY</b> product, pay attention to the <b>Competitor1</b> , which is currently actively developing the <b>Project1</b> project.  It is necessary to plan what will show <b>Competitor1</b> and <b>Competitor2</b> in 6-12 months in their products.  To compare these data with the objectives of the company, to suggest what can happen when the paths cross.  In such regions as <i>Moscow</i> , <i>St. Petersburg</i> , <b>COMPANY</b> clearly lags behind competitors, which means you need to catch up with them.  In turn, on the <i>Windows Phone</i> platform, <b>Competitor2</b> is not officially represented, and in <b>Competitor1 it is</b> not possible to use this product offline. <br><br>  It is necessary to take into account the factors of the rapid development of telecommunication technologies.  Already now you can watch panoramas from your mobile.  With the development of technology, mobile phones will be able, for example, to play video tours with high quality.  The growth of the productivity of "iron" and the ability of mobile cameras will open new frontiers for the realization of the ideas of augmented reality, the integration of special devices, for example, glasses with a three-dimensional image.  For the <b>COMPANY</b> product on the <i>Windows Phone</i> platform <i>,</i> it is necessary to pay attention to the development calendar of this platform.  Follow the new tools, frameworks from <i>Microsoft</i> , which will provide access to the use of new technical features. <br><br>  In general, you need to understand who the target audience is.  All improvements and changes in the system should not contradict its interests.  The use of such techniques as cohort analysis will be especially useful.  In the case of <b>COMPANY,</b> this clause may be the least useful given the large heterogeneity of the potential audience.  Development of the community, a platform for discussing the product, conducting surveys and communication between users of the product.  Listen and encourage people with enthusiasm, hold quarterly rallies with them, to get feedback. <br><br>  I think the task to come up with new opportunities for the <b>COMPANY</b> product is not.  The stock of features for the development of mapping and reference services is sufficient and is well known to professionals from this field.  Technically it is possible to develop in width - add new features, and in depth - develop existing ones.  Important here is the choice of the very features that will be implemented within 6-12 months.  To do this, it is worth considering the value of the feature, the cost of resources, the experience of competitors, the desire of users.  The choice is the result of a discussion of the feature pool with the team.  The final decision on the implementation of a specific feature is always taken by the product manager, based on the above factors and on his own sense of the market.  In this case, I always take responsibility for myself. <br><br>  <b>4. Give any examples of a convenient and inconvenient interface.</b>  <b>What is the most successful and most unsuccessful in them?</b> <br><br>  When answering this question, I first of all proceeded from the fact that there is no point in citing "overwritten" examples of good and bad interfaces.  These cases are already known to everyone from the Internet and the corresponding books on UI / UX.  Therefore, I will give examples from <b>COMPANY</b> products and competitors.  For example, in <b>Google Maps</b> ( <i>iPhone</i> version) in pursuit of beauty and minimalism, there is no possibility of using the application with one hand, which does not correspond to today's mobile trends.  In <b>Yandex.Maps</b> and <b>2GIS-e,</b> for the function of zooming in / out the map, it is possible to enable special buttons for the Card Approach / Distance.  The tool must first be comfortable, not beautiful. <br><br>  I consider it successful to display the proposed routes in <b>Yandex.Maps</b> and <b>2GIS</b> (on the <i>Windows Phone</i> platform).  Before you choose a route, the user has the opportunity to see it on the map. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Caution!</b>  <b class="spoiler_title">Screenshot!</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ad5/b41/c2a/ad5b41c2a89744628f1793ffaa3d90ba.jpg"></div></div><br>  In turn, I consider the unsuccessful interface of <b>2GIS</b> (on the <i>iPhone</i> , <i>Android platforms</i> ) when moving from search results to search results on a map (‚ÄúShow on map‚Äù) and back.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> It creates a hierarchical structure, in my opinion, unnecessary tabs, in which you can easily get lost, and use them several times more often is not necessary. </font></font><br><br><pre> <code class="hljs cpp"><span class="hljs-meta"><span class="hljs-meta">#</span><span class="hljs-meta-keyword"><span class="hljs-meta"><span class="hljs-meta-keyword">endif</span></span></span><span class="hljs-meta"> </span><span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-meta"><span class="hljs-comment">/* MY_HABRA_ENTRY */</span></span></span></span></code> </pre> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/242015/">https://habr.com/ru/post/242015/</a></p>
