    <h1>  Bit of a boring theory </h1><br>  Despite the similar appearance, with today's fashionable Bluetooth headphones, these devices have only a common constructive.  Inside, everything is the same: battery, microphone, digital signal processor, amplifier and speaker.  Only there is no Bluetooth module.  But they work differently. <br><br>  The microphone picks up ambient sounds, the digital signal processor corrects the frequency response, the amplifier amplifies, and the speaker emits exactly the same vibrations as those that enter the ear from the same direction, only in antiphase.  And all this is right in your middle ear, subtracted and transformed into heat.  Of course, to warm up this way is not enough power, but silence is assured. <br><br>  What about the KISS principle?  Construction headphones will turn the ambient sounds into heat even in foam rubber, and they will not even reach the outer ear.  And note, without these your batteries and processors.  Well, I'll come from afar. <br><br>  The KISS principle increases reliability, but not flexibility.  So, in large halls, drummers are screened with Plexiglas, and inside the resulting ‚Äúcabinet‚Äù they surround them with microphones.  Although the KISS-principle suggests that it is easier not to let the sounds of the drums through the general audio system of the hall, but simply to give them the opportunity to spread directly to the audience.  Tools are loud, even in the last rows will be heard! <br><br>  Yes, they will.  But if the installation is located on the stage asymmetrically, then one half of the hall will hear louder than the other.  Another drummer will interfere with singing and playing other performers on the stage.  And nothing about the correction of frequency response and operational volume control compared with other performers can not be considered! <br><br>  And if the drummer is acoustically shielded, then with a signal from the microphones behind the plexiglas, you can do whatever the sound engineer wants.  Yes, and let the speakers in the hall, in the "monitors" on the stage - no. <br><br>  That's the same here.  Building headphones will attenuate all sounds to the same extent.  And the active noise suppressor with a digital signal processor can suppress some sounds, while others can leave it unchanged.  What the programmer writes will be done with sound.  Talk with a neighbor in the car 81-717 / 714, which is still a lot?  Easy! <br><br><h1>  And now - to practice </h1><br>  The set is delivered in this box: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/t3/io/ta/t3iota9nth_ui_hm8imp65wzyiw.jpeg"><br><br>  We pull out the cardboard ‚Äúbox‚Äù, as if from a miniature dresser, and we see a hard case with noise suppressors: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vf/s9/a_/vfs9a_zhqsymuzo7gtvvr2uzqnu.jpeg"><br><br>  Having disassembled the ‚Äúbox‚Äù, we take out the cord, a bag with four additional ear inserts of other sizes and instructions in English.  The instruction in Russian is placed in the same box separately. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qf/3u/kt/qf3uktlk_benm3nkc70aqiyf3cs.jpeg"><br><br>  Opening the cover, we see contact pads on the noise suppressors, which are at the same time design elements, and springs on the inside surface of the cover: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ct/oh/2i/ctoh2ip2ueornumfxq5msaotwzc.jpeg"><br><br>  Again we close and find the connector on the side of the cover: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rq/oo/dz/rqoodzxqabvbga6ujprenqu_jiu.jpeg"><br><br>  Together with the supplied cord, the case looks like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/v7/qq/q-/v7qqq-7eksxkeqhlnl8v9wytbjw.jpeg"><br><br>  The power supply unit is not included in the package, this is the ‚ÄúNintendo logic‚Äù: it is already there for everyone.  We put a cover with noise suppressors on charging: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/t-/az/je/t-azjewoqaqo-zcocljpkftr_pg.jpeg"><br><br>  If you take a picture without a flash, the charging indication light is visible.  There are two LEDs, which allows to determine whether the springs are well pressed to the sites of each of the devices, and whether the battery is charged in each of them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/t2/gs/bo/t2gsbop5gd6pe8sqgh4ngujfi5w.jpeg"><br><br><h1>  Yuzkeys </h1><br>  While there is a charge, we get acquainted with a yuzkeys.  Here it is, our hero of the occasion, in all its glory: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ra/gs/ck/ragsck5fnoterbutwebageywzcc.jpeg"><br><br>  It is interesting because, in the opinion of the authors of articles on exercise bikes, it ... does not exist.  Everywhere they write that they have loads of three types: mechanical, magnetic (on eddy currents) and electromotive.  Here is the radial fan. <br><br>  This simulator - on the contrary, the triumph of the KISS principle, as dragged from the clothing market in the nineties, works the same, but yells!  Ears do not lay, but interfere with listening to the radio.  This is the third, and it is louder than the previous two.  Not really helpful. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/s5/ce/ts/s5cetsydjxjdul7bxsnd0uacibg.jpeg"><br><br>  Let's see if the noise cancellers can handle it. <br><br><h1>  Back to practice </h1><br>  An hour passed, and the brightness of the LEDs was greatly reduced.  Charging is over.  The noise cancellers spend joules more slowly than they pick up - with unworn batteries, they will last for 50 hours.  Open the cover and get the device. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sg/ol/na/sgolnacaxnvjvueowigrdteps2k.jpeg"><br><br>  The instruction states that they will turn on automatically after being removed from the case.  At first I decided that there were magnets in the case and Hall sensors or reed switches in the headphones.  But the magnets in the case could not be found, which means that the devices turned on even earlier - when the case was opened and the sites with the springs stopped contacting.  To check the battery charge, the instruction suggests closing the earmold with your finger so that acoustic feedback is generated.  It follows that not only the speaker, but also the microphone are directed to the insert.  The device "hears" the sound exactly as you hear it.  It's easier to read. <br><br>  <a href="https://vocaroo.com/i/s0ooHC1csAoR">Let's check</a> <br><br>  Charged great!  Wear noise suppressants, paying attention to the letters L and R, as well as turning them only as shown in the figure.  Otherwise, the effectiveness of noise reduction will be less.  In addition, with improper donning, a slight acoustic feedback may occur. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/9m/iv/pl/9mivpl2z_zon8gn_vd3d9rrnkro.jpeg"><br><br>  Turn on the radio and try to twist the exercise bike, wearing noise suppressors, as well as not putting them on.  Indeed, with them the ratio of the volume of the radio and the exercise bike is changing - in favor of the radio, of course.  But it also sounds noticeably quieter.  No adjustments or mode switching are provided. <br><br>  I did not immediately manage to record the sound in the first case and in the second.  I press the insert to the microphone of the smartphone - and there is acoustic feedback, loosen the clamp - the sound penetrates around the device.  So these two audio files are not recorded in real: in one case I brought the smartphone closer to the simulator, in the second I took it a little further.  But what the user hears is transmitted fairly accurately. <br><br>  <a href="https://vocaroo.com/i/s0qGT1ePf41I">No noise cancellation</a> <br><br>  <a href="https://vocaroo.com/i/s0G5btS5SLK4">And with such</a> <br><br>  Of course, you can listen to music on a noisy simulator by simply placing ordinary headphones under construction.  But it is not only less elegant, but also the ears will sweat.  So despite the drawbacks (some suppression and necessary sounds, the danger of losing miniature noise suppressors like Bluetooth headphones), the advantages outweigh, and in general the product can be recommended for such an application. <br><br>  And in some situations, building headphones and completely out of place - you will look strange in them.  In addition to the old metro cars mentioned above, active noise suppressors can be worn in any noisy means of transport - unless, of course, you are a passenger, not a driver.  And not only in transport, but also outside of it.  Sometimes at the bus stop you have to hide from the noise behind the bus shelter, and in fact from the opposite side he does not have a bench.  The main thing to remember to remove the device, as well as ordinary headphones and hood, on the "zebra" and the railway crossing. <br><br>  Following the <a href="http://goo.gl/DMvcqS">link</a> and using the TORMOZ promo code, you will be able to purchase this product at a 10% discount. <br><br>  Thanks for attention! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/428672/">https://habr.com/ru/post/428672/</a></p>
