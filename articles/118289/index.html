After acknowledging the fact of compromising user data, Sony has published a FAQ for users who consider themselves victims - some answers cannot be considered exhaustive, but this is already something. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Here are the answers to some of the most popular questions among PSN users:

      <b>Have my personal data been encrypted?</b> <br><br>  All data was protected, and access to it was closed both physically and programmatically.  Data on credit cards was encrypted, and there is no reason to believe that these data were stolen.  Other personal data, which came apart from credit card data, was not encrypted, but was protected by a complex security system that was cracked. <br><br>  <b>Have my credit card details been stolen?</b> <br><br>  All data of this kind stored in our system is encrypted, and there is no reason to believe that this time they were stolen, but we do not discard this possibility.  If you did not comply with the security measures recommended by us when using credit cards in the PlayStation Network and Qriocity services, then some data could be stolen (except for the security code).  However, a security code (CVC or CSC) cannot be stolen from the system, since we never request it, and data on the codes are not stored in the system. <br><br>  <b>When and how can I change my password from PlayStation Network?</b> <br><br>  We are working on a new security system, and upon completion of work, all users will have to change the passwords from PlayStation Network as soon as the system is restored.  We will soon provide more detailed information about the update. <br><br>  <b>Have all PlayStation Network and Qriocity users been alerted to the incident?</b> <br><br>  In addition to the information published in various information resources and in this blog, we also sent e-mail to all 77 million registered users.  Sending such a large number of messages takes a lot of time, in addition, you need to take into account that not all e-mail addresses registered in the system are still active.  Currently, the majority of messages sent, and we think that all registered users will receive a notification by April 28.  Customers can also visit <a href="http://www.us.playstation.com/support">www.us.playstation.com/support</a> and <a href="http://www.qriocity.com/">www.qriocity.com</a> for more information. <br><br>  Read all the answers to the questions <a href="http://blog.us.playstation.com/2011/04/27/qa-1-for-playstation-network-and-qriocity-services/">here</a> . <br><br>  By the way, the CNET information portal <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-27080_3-20058067-245.html">told about several cases of</a> debiting money from credit cards of PSN users without their knowledge.  But for now these are isolated cases that may not be related to the hacking of Sony services that occurred earlier. <br><br>  Sony will obviously have to ‚Äúwash‚Äù away from what happened for a long time, and it‚Äôs not a fact that after some time a new series of attacks on the services of the corporation will not follow - there are a lot of enemies the company has made. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/118289/">https://habr.com/ru/post/118289/</a></p>
