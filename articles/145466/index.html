One and a half thousand people, dozens of reports and workshops, large-scale CTF competitions, a rich competitive program - all this is PHDays.  Now we can say with full responsibility that we managed to mix a special cocktail from representatives of the Internet community, information security professionals and hackers from different countries of the world and that the cocktail turned out to be delicious. <br><br>  Today, as promised, we will publish records of reports and master classes from PHDays 2012. Among the gigabytes of information security video, there is a thing, as they say, Goethe‚Äôs Faust, a report by Bruce Schneier, the legend of world cryptography.
