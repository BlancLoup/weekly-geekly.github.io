  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Penguin cookies</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d24/06c/b06/d2406cb06666acf99192aee3989bdd92.png" align="right">  First of all, when I go to the site, I pay attention to the domain name.  If the domain name of the site is beautiful or unusual, then the site content should be excellent.  For example, all of us favorite habrahabr - and the domain is strange, and the site on it is excellent. <br>  And for the domain <a href="https://01.org/">01.org</a> I would even be ready to give up all my bad habits: I don‚Äôt have anything more to me, and the domain is just a dream. <br>  But the domain is busy, and difficult people settled on it - they call themselves OTC and are decoded as the Intel Open Source Technology Center.  This is an extremely small group of engineers at Intel (no more than 50 people) that does what they love in an open format. <br>  They have two types of projects.  The second is when they send code to other large projects, and Intel engineers act as regular programmers.  Well, it would be very strange if Intel did not send patches to, say, the Linux kernel or Xen, or KVM.  At the same time they send patches to Qt and Tizen, to which I personally have high hopes, despite all the records on the Internet. <br>  But I will not tell about all this - I will tell about the first type of projects.  About those projects that Intel has created itself. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  powertop </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fc1/4dd/c5e/fc14ddc5e172d57b500045bd7b1f1f4d.png"><br><br>  I'll start with the project, which originally was on another great domain: lesswatts.org.  Anyone who in the past 2 years wondered about energy saving in Linux, could not pass by this site.  There was simply no possibility, because this site was not only enough to give advice on energy saving (there is not much information on the Internet, let's be honest), it was also the home page for the console utility <a href="https://01.org/powertop/">powertop</a> . <br><br>  If you have not tried it yet, do it today.  When I look into something from the category of ps, top, htop, I see the total number of processes, it seems, I even see which are running now and how many percents of memory and processor they seem to consume, but I can never understand how many actually eats resources. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      In the powertop, on the contrary, it is immediately clear.  And it is clear on the physical level that the light now consumes 2.4W, and the opera is only 540mW, even though I actively use it.  And if you run chrome and webgl, then you can see how chrome eats 1W of energy.  This is just magic, not a program.  Watching the voracity of processes in physical equivalent of power - it just takes my breath away. <br><br>  And still powertop is able to generate html reports on power consumption, one report takes up exactly one file, but it has tabs.  And these reports are convenient to send by mail to friends to brag.  No, well, really, the reports are very cool made. Such quality of performance is rarely seen. <br><br>  I would love 01.org and for only the powertop, but there is more interesting. <br><br><h2>  Intel Node Manager </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5d9/085/5a1/5d90855a1a30d141ca11bca715114802.png"><br><br>  Powertop, of course, a great program, but it was created for individual use.  But there are areas where computer power consumption is very important.  The more energy consumed - the more expensive.  Significantly more expensive.  And yes, I mean data centers.  There are hundreds of computers there, each is heated and relentlessly absorbs watts.  To educate them, and all at once, you can use the <a href="https://01.org/nodemanager/">Intel Node Manager</a> . <br><br>  Node Manager is written specifically for data centers.  With it, you can determine how much each node is consuming and how hot it is, scatter the nodes evenly on the racks, taking into account their appetite, and in case of switching to autonomous power, switch the server to energy saving mode. <br><br>  I will not lie - I would have enjoyed working for a couple of months as an administrator in the data center to use this service in combat conditions. <br><br><h2>  Intel Linux Graphics </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f3d/bdd/a0a/f3dbdda0a1653d8c4add139ca7aa6bf1.png"><br><br>  I have been using Linux for a long time and remember with horror the times when setting up a video driver was a problem.  Life without opengl?  Thank you for at least the browser does not have to use the console.  And the choice of video driver for mplayer, which slows down less than others?  And horrors with ati drivers?  So many years have passed, but still think a few times before you buy an ati-shnuyu video card. <br><br>  Intel simply writes its own <a href="https://01.org/linuxgraphics/about/">drivers</a> and does not force people to engage in reverse engineering of the hardware.  Thank you, OTC, for spending 20 minutes setting up a video on a new laptop.  And even opengl in games works. <br><br><h2>  Android on Intel Architecture </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e14/b5f/308/e14b5f308ed27c0ac04ad43cde9ad6d6.png"><br><br>  Not all of us love android, but we all know about its existence and used at least a little.  Well, to be honest, a strong player in the modern mobile market.  5 years ago I stopped believing that I would ever have a phone on the x86 platform.  I do not know why I wanted this, but this phone would be just a full-fledged computer.  Other words do not pick up.  Well, in Intel, and ported <a href="https://01.org/android-ia/">android to x86 architecture</a> (the latest version of March 11).  Well, all this is not just a desire and useless build of an android for another platform, but quite a real need after all the phones on the Atom are much more than one: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/intel/blog/150099/">MegaFon Mint</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/151718/">Motorolla Razr</a> , <a href="http://www.gsmarena.com/lenovo_k900-5241.php">Lenovo k900</a> ... <br><br>  So I'm not at all sure that my Nokia n9 will be replaced by Tizen or a Jolla phone.  Maybe it will be an android on x86 (Ingress, ahahaha, what are you doing, stop it). <br><br><h2>  Web tools </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/996/e52/5da/996e525daae516dd26fac2cd49b240b9.gif"><br><br>  The Internet is changing not just rapidly, but rather lightning.  A couple of years ago, it was popular, sorry for dirty foul language, Microsoft Front Page, and now some web applications are more pleasant and convenient to use than the usual traditional software. <br><br>  Web applications have become such a powerful tool that even operating systems already exist where HTML + Javascript successfully replaces traditional programs.  These are both desktop ChromeOs, mobile Firefox OS, webOS and, of course, Tizen mentioned by me. <br><br>  Naturally, for successful development you need the appropriate tools, and Intel wrote it and put it in open access. <br><br>  <a href="https://01.org/rib/">Rapid Interface Builder</a> is a tool for quickly prototyping a web application interface right in a browser.  It works on jQuery Mobile, and jQuery Mobile works everywhere, so if you need to create an interface for a mobile web application, take a look at the RIB. <br><br>  <a href="https://01.org/web-simulator/">Web Simulator</a> - extends the capabilities of Google Chrome developer tools and adds support for Tizen web API, but other mobile platforms may be added in the future. <br><br>  <a href="https://01.org/html5webapps/">HTML5 WebApps</a> is something very intriguing to me.  If the description does not deceive me, then soon an example of web applications written using javascript and canvas will be added to this address.  Right now I am writing a game on canvas at work and I'm very interested in what else can I do with it.  There are many experiments on the Internet, but there are not so many completed applications and games yet.  I hope that Intel will show something interesting and challenging. <br><br><h2>  the end </h2><br><br>  I hope you learned something interesting or useful from this post.  If someone has set up a video driver in Linux for the HD3000 / HD4000, after reading this post, he will say thanks or immediately install a powertop for himself and, like me, will stick into it - it means that he wrote for good reason :). <br><br><h2>  Voting </h2><br>  And at the end of the post, I would like to make you glad that this is another post written for normal people and therefore there will be no vote. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/171599/">https://habr.com/ru/post/171599/</a></p>
