Everyone is looking for new approaches, channels, cases to ‚Äúcut a window‚Äù into the top of the market with the lowest cost.  And, it seems, we managed to invent something new.  Ugh, ugh, ugh!  We hope, on Habr√© there will be many experts who will appreciate our efforts. <br><br>  I'll start the story with a small case.  Our company is engaged in the creation of mobile games.  We have a small base of subscribers, which we periodically notify about new releases, through sms-mailings.  The base was going for a long time, for various reasons, we did not segment it by platforms.  Therefore, Android users received news that was of interest to iOs users, and vice versa. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThis is an abnormal situation that violates the karma of loyalty of our customers‚Äù - we decided.  As a result, an idea was born that gradually led to the emergence of a new service, with a different main purpose.  They say that with startups this happens quite often. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Meet:

      <a href="http://lotcat.com/">LotCat</a> (http://lotcat.com) is a service that saves money and time on promoting mobile applications. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/efa/315/65c/efa31565c5ec45a38df90cc8953e3807.png"><br><br>  At first glance - this is the usual ‚Äúshortcut‚Äù, which combines links to all markets and platforms into one short one.  Actually, this was the first idea of ‚Äã‚Äãour brainstorm. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/48b/1b8/f97/48b1b8f9781b4fe793bfa5459f45ccfe.png" width="500"><br><br>  A single link can be sent in the SMS mailing list to all users, and the system already recognizes who loves apples, and who is green men.  We have even provided a Desktop link, in case the link needs to be ‚Äúsown‚Äù not only in SMS. <br><br>  The first version of LotCat had just such a simple functional that was written ‚Äúon the knees‚Äù and for internal use.  They tested, painted a cute cat (they love cats on the Internet) and went on ... <br><br><h4>  QR code to help </h4><br>  A few years ago, a QR code was considered a very promising technology for advertising.  He is now used in creative marketing solutions.  But, unfortunately, many advertisers consider the application of a QR code to be creative.  Although there are original examples. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/994/94a/a2c/99494aa2cba84d87b920aa3c44958093.png"><br>  <i>The pavilion near the Red Square, which brought victory to Russia at the architectural biennale in Venice.</i> <br><br>  In LotCat, we decided to return the practical value of this technology by adding the ability to create a QR code from the resulting single reference. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e88/9c2/498/e889c249817e4d7ea2661bda6a7f6685.png"><br><br><h4>  What is it for? </h4><br>  First of all, QR expands the possibilities of advertising a mobile application - from social networks to offline.  You can place it on the sand (see photo), on the car, on the banner, on the pole, on the table - yes anywhere!  Thanks to LotCat, a user with any platform will follow the link specified in the code, immediately to his market. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/440/bac/637/440bac6373b849d0be8b455b2846db51.jpg"><br>  <i>QR code LotCat in advertising one of our projects.</i> <br><br>  KISSmetrics research shows that posts with photos get 53% more likes, 104% more comments and 84% more clicks.  Visualization today is a trend, thanks to which image-oriented social networks are growing at unprecedented rates: Instagram, Pinterest (do you feel like digging with QR codes?).  Large entertainment communities are not far behind, in the description of each of which you will see a recommendation to post content with pictures. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/248/7c7/b33/2487c7b338b24c3796c5fd5ef7231d8e.png"><br>  <i>Sand QR code from the Japanese company Japan Trends.</i> <i><br></i> <br><br>  In our case, the QR code, ‚Äúpainted‚Äù into the image, will replace the six links and exactly attract attention.  A certain percentage of readers will not refrain from scanning directly from the screen - this is a fact. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/411/8f2/87a/4118f287aea5488696bd0aa84d6920cc.png"><br>  <i>The king of burgers knows a lot about effective advertising.</i> <br><br>  We ourselves tried to place a QR-code with LotCat with a link to the game in the public pages of Vkontakte and made sure that quite a large part of users actually scan such pictures and go to the market. <br>  But that is not all‚Ä¶ <br><br><h4>  Statistics </h4><br>  Any Captain Obvious will tell you that when you run an ad campaign of a mobile application or promote a game, you need to track and understand which channels are the most successful in terms of conversion into installations, which platforms are more in demand, etc.  etc.  It does not hurt to analyze the effectiveness of a particular placement of advertising applications offline.  This is more difficult, although look what we came up with. <br><br>  We added statistics to LotCat. <br><br>  The system collects and displays data on referrals, referrals, browsers, countries, platforms.  This is a necessary minimum, which will allow you to see, for example, that your application in the subway is downloaded by more users from Android, and a booklet in a restaurant leads people from Apple.  Although maybe you will be different? <br><br><h4>  The most important thing </h4><br>  Finally, we come to the main function of LotCat, for which the most difficult work was done on writing this post. <br><br>  The attentive reader, most likely, has already wondered: what to do with users, for whose platforms we do not have the appropriate version of the application? <br><br>  Suppose you created an application for the Android platform and placed it on the Google Play Market.  A link from the Play Market was added to LotCat and received a short URL and a QR code.  Now you place them in advertising, on sites, in reviews, etc.  If the link comes to you a user with an Android device - he downloads the application and is happy immensely.  And if this is a person with an iPhone or Windows gadget?  And if Blackberry? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/67d/4f9/b03/67d4f9b039ac4393819626914d73bab0.png"><br>  <i>There are enough lovers of rare devices in the world.</i> <br><br>  Previously, we would simply lose such users.  But with LotCat, a user with a different platform gets to the cute ‚ÄúComing soon ...‚Äù page and an ad unit from other applications already for its platform! <br><br>  For each user click on this block, you earn credits.  For these loans, you advertise your application in the same blocks of other LotCat users.  Thus, no one else loses traffic from platforms for which there is no application.  It is converted into advertising its applications.  No more "unnecessary" traffic!  ‚ÄúEverything will come in handy, everything is in the house!‚Äù, As my neighbor liked to say, dragging another fragment of the old playground into the stairwell. <br><br><h4>  Summarize </h4><br>  So, we have a product that saves money on the promotion of applications or games and expands the audience. <br><br>  It is very easy to use: <br><ul><li>  Create a single LotCat-link and QR-code for your game or application; </li><li>  Connect to it links to your product for different markets; </li><li>  Promote them all at once, analyze; </li><li>  Earn credits and spend them on advertising. </li></ul><br><br>  Do we have plans to make loans?  Answer without guile - yes!  But we are still in the process of developing such a monetization model, which will be almost imperceptible for the participants of the system.  Perhaps we will make a credit exchange, or maybe we will find some other options? <br><br>  We will be happy to receive feedback, criticism and suggestions from the respected Habra community! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/251683/">https://habr.com/ru/post/251683/</a></p>
