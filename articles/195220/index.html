To this I will add that it is less than two hours from here to the Mediterranean Sea and three hours to the Atlantic Ocean by car.  Just a stone‚Äôs throw away, the Pyrenees and Spain.  The air temperature today is 27 degrees.  If you are interested, then I can reveal an easy way to move here to live. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Now working in the IT field, I can say with confidence that the easiest way is to learn a good programmer, and then employers will issue all the necessary papers themselves, will rent housing and pay for the move with the family.  I myself know an excellent office, which itself travels to neighboring countries in search of talented developers. <br><br>  I'm not a talented developer, but a simple Russian guy from the province.  But nine years ago, I discovered the secret (for non-Francophone speakers) knowledge that at Toulouse University No. 2, called Mirai, there is a DEFLE faculty (French as a foreign language) and teaching it is virtually free (300-500 euros per year depending on Do you need insurance).

      Registration for the 2014-2015 school year is made in January (right after the holidays, I was not told the exact date) in February 2014 <a href="http://defle.univ-tlse2.fr/accueil/nos-formations/">on the faculty website</a> . <br>  It will be necessary to follow the link ‚Äúcliquer ici‚Äù and go through prerecord.  Now there is nothing there, the link will work only in January.  You will need to fill out a form and provide a copy and certified translation of the certificate of secondary education and university diplomas / certificates.  This year 200 places will be given.  The Secretariat did not disclose to me the principle on which candidates will be selected (most likely there are country quotas, but I can only guess).  They said that this is not the order of pre-recording, but I‚Äôll say from myself that, all other things being equal, they will still choose the first enroller.  What exactly does not matter is the knowledge of French.  Here there is a cleaning group from full zero, with an explanation on the fingers, he got there in due time.  Age restrictions, as far as I know, no.  When I signed up I was 25, I saw students and over 50. <br><br>  Then in May they will contact you and confirm the entry.  With her, in the summer you will go to the embassy to get a student visa and upon arrival go through the final entry with a student card. <br><br>  Why is it so cool?  France is a magnificent country, and the south of France is a beautiful land of a magnificent country!  But seriously, even if you are a programmer or designer and your professional qualifications are quite at the level required here, you still most likely need French.  Why not teach him in a measured rhythm already being in a warm country?  In addition, a student visa allows you to work 20 hours a week (or 60% of the usual time in a year, you can work them out en masse, without spreading it for the whole year).  You can continue to freelance. <br><br>  With time, you yourself decide whether you need a working (or family, who knows?) Visa or you are tired and you want to go back to your homeland. <br><br>  Personally, I was already in my second year at DEFLE that I didn‚Äôt have enough French and enrolled in the art department of the same university, then I learned that the specialized √âcole des Beaux-Arts was better and enrolled there as well.  In this case, not discharging from two other places of study.  He studied in three places and still worked.  Stretched a whole semester.  But we will not be distracted. <br><br>  There are also disadvantages in Toulouse.  Due to the fact that it is a very student city, and of course Airbus, housing is difficult here.  Here, homeowners choose tenants.  France is a very bureaucratic country, there are high taxes here and they are very punctual.  But the pros and cons of France and Toulouse are a separate big topic.  If you are interested in something, then ask in the comments - I will answer. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/195220/">https://habr.com/ru/post/195220/</a></p>
