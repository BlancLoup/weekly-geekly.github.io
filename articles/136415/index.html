Savings are achieved due to the fact that the company does not acquire expensive <br>  MSSQL server and extra 1C: Enterprise licenses, but limited to the purchase of 1C server, <br>  which in many cases already exists.  The hosting provider can accommodate <br>  website running on 1C: Enterprise data.  For posting, archiving and uninterrupted <br>  The database and the website are hosted by the hosting provider. <br><br>  The technology is called Open Infobase. <br>  The resulting solution on the one hand supports the web interface by means of Asp.Net, <br>  on the other hand, the 1C-interface by native means 1C: Enterprise 8.2 / 8.1.

    <h4>  Asp.Net's contribution to the overall solution </h4><br><br>  1C: Enterprise has always taken a cynical and simple approach in its development: <br>  the product developed only in the direction that promised the most tangible profits. <br>  on the fact of occurrence.  As a result, 1C: Enterprise has always lagged behind in its development. <br>  from global trends, and the product is popular only in Russia without a chance to reach developed <br>  countries, as evidenced by a failed project in Germany, which started with a fanfare <br>  in 2007.  To prevent the emergence of analogs of popular business applications, <br>  1C closes file formats and confuses data structure. <br><br>  Starting with version 8.2, 1C: Enterprise added work via the Internet: now informational <br>  Bases can be published on web servers.  This was done in a manner peculiar to 1C: <br>  many bugs in the release, you need a license for each connection to the database, no speech <br>  Do not go about managing the generation of HTML, do not wait and do not try to use modern <br>  technologies Flash, RSS, WAP, OpenId, AJAX, jQuery, etc.  And if there is hope for correction <br>  errors over the next few years, the 1C web client for mass visits <br>  still does not fit.  Instead, the time-tested Asp.Net will do; <br>  version 4.0. <br><br>  Asp.Net technology adds the word ‚ÄúOpen‚Äù to the name of the solution ‚ÄúOpen InfoBase‚Äù, emphasizing <br>  that the technology is ‚Äúopen‚Äù to all visitors to the Internet, search engines and special <br>  services.  To achieve the goal, apply the whole arsenal of technologies and Asp.Net- and .Net-classes: <br>  Asp.Net MVC, AJAX, web forms, localization, multithreading, LINQ, LINQToSQL and PLINQ <br>  and many others. <br><br>  When developing applications for Asp.Net, you have full control over HTML rendering. <br>  You can choose any style of interface through the style sheets, <br>  animate the interface with DHTML, play with new HTML 5. You can quickly implement <br>  general application in different languages ‚Äã‚Äãusing localization tools.  Total <br>  You will not get this by applying the standard approach proposed in 1C: Enterprise. <br><br>  A lot of the power of web developers devote search engine optimization or SEO.  Apply <br>  Asp.Net MVC to easily generate your URL paths, create robots.txt, sitemap files, <br>  create on the fly the necessary meta tags title, description, keywords.  Participate <br>  in the link exchange.  You will again appreciate the advantages of Asp.Net compared to 1C. <br><br>  Your web application will remain compatible with Web 2.0 and generally accepted international standards. <br>  unlike 1C: Enterprise, which is compatible only with itself.  Apply <br>  Ajax, log in through OpenId-compatible systems, freely use maps <br>  Google and Yandex and place on the maps the necessary information, publish the news feed. <br><br>  Important is the support of mobile devices.  No problem getting <br>  WML with the necessary minimum of information means, for example, Asp.Net MVC and force <br>  work mobile devices over the Internet with your information base. <br><br><h4>  The contribution of 1C: Enterprise in the overall solution </h4><br><br>  Despite the fact that 1C: Enterprise cannot compete in web development with Asp.Net, <br>  1C perfectly manifests itself as a desktop application.  In comparison with 1C: Enterprise .Net <br>  The framework remains just a collection of unrelated classes.  Undoubtedly, on the .Net framework <br>  You can rewrite 1C: Enterprise, but it will take many years.  Another advantage <br>  1C - is the prevalence of the system, relatively low price, availability <br>  army 1C programmers and a huge number of developments in the public domain. <br><br>  In the Open InfoBase 1C: Enterprise approach, you can develop an application very quickly, <br>  suitable for data entry.  A simple application may take 1-2 days.  With <br>  This 1C is immediately responsible for creating the data structure on the database server.  Users <br>  data in a Desktop application, which is 1C, is more convenient and faster to contribute than to <br>  web application. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b60/8b7/b4b/b608b7b4b33021ef8b0bfafe0eee6803.png" alt="On a simple application 1C: Enterprise may take 1-2 days"><br><br>  1C applications can be quickly made distributed, allowing you to connect <br>  several offices.  For example, if a real estate agency has branches in several cities, <br>  then each branch works with its data locally, and the final data is merged <br>  and displayed on the website.  Another example is load balancing when bases <br>  1C data are located on different servers and 1C synchronization occurs <br>  information. <br><br>  Starting with version 8.1, a rich reporting tool is built into 1C: Enterprise <br>  "Data Composition System".  Reports are created quickly, have flexibility in settings. <br>  tables, columns and rows, and can also be exported to many formats. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0fe/338/172/0fe33817285173f80df08e0910f546e0.png" alt="Data Composition System"><br><br>  Work with data: enter, edit, delete and search faster and more convenient in <br>  1C: Enterprise.  1C has a built-in full-text search.  Application can share <br>  data with other configurations of 1C: Enterprise, such as 1C: Accounting or 1C: Management <br>  trade in the "native language".  Import / export between 1C applications is quickly configured <br>  tools 1C: Data Conversion and "Transfer between identical configurations." <br><br>  1C: Enterprise includes a number of specialized facilities that are well developed. <br>  in popular 1C solutions.  Remains and movements in finance, goods faster and more convenient. <br>  organize on a specialized object 1C: Enterprise "Register of accumulation" and <br>  receive movements and balances for any period.  Exchange rates are more appropriate to place <br>  in the ‚ÄúRegister of information‚Äù and get the right rate for a specific date. <br><br><h4>  Difficulties of simultaneous work 1C: Enterprise and Asp.Net </h4><br><br>  The expediency of joint use of 1C: Enterprise and Asp.Net is shown in previous <br>  sections of the article.  Both technologies work equally well with Microsoft SQL Server DBMS. <br>  It is the reference to the same data that MSSQL uses Open InfoBase technology. <br>  Theoretically, there are no problems, but there are difficulties to be solved in practice. <br><br>  As stated earlier, 1C: Enterprise intentionally closes its data formats and structure. <br>  data to counteract the emergence of clone products on the market.  Main difficulty <br>  in the case of 1C - there is no standard regarding the names of tables and fields in the database <br>  1C.  If someone looked inside the database, he could see a lot of tables <br>  with obscure names, which are fields with an incomprehensible purpose. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/015/9e2/ee8/0159e2ee8f423873835f2b11baa6babe.png" alt="The internal data structure of 1C: Enterprise"><br><br>  This circumstance complicates access to 1C data from Asp.Net, for example, through obtaining <br>  DataReader and DataTable objects.  Once generated, the query may lose its meaning. <br>  and do not work with a meaningful update of the configuration 1C or on the configuration of another <br>  enterprises. <br><br>  There is a solution to this difficulty.  The appearance in the .Net framework technology LinqToSql caused <br>  for many, and for me, including the reasonable question: "Why is it necessary?".  After all, many <br>  used SQL expressions or stored procedures to access the MSSQL database, <br>  continue to use them even after the release of LinqToSql.  It turned out exactly <br>  LinqToSql is suitable for direct access to the 1C information base. <br><br>  LinqToSql mechanisms require special .Net classes that are generated <br>  compiler automatically based on dbml file.  The dbml file is an XML file with the definition <br>  matches between the names of tables, fields, and the names of .Net classes. <br><br>  To facilitate the generation of a DBML file based on 1C metadata, a utility has been created. <br>  Elisy.LinqTo1C.  Comes with the Elisy .Net Bridge extension, as it is drawn <br>  to the functionality of .Net framework from 1C: Enterprise.  After specifying the connection string <br>  to SKLServer, the name of the paged file, the names of paged objects processing Elisy.LinqTo1C <br>  on output gets the corresponding dbml- and cs-files.  The CS file contains all the necessary <br>  class descriptions and can be inserted into a .Net project.  DBML file can be viewed <br>  from the Visual Studio editor.  Access to data is significantly transformed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/84b/d7d/187/84bd7d187d8cef65e9f80d859f23c5c6.png" alt="The result of obtaining a DBML file for the internal data structure of 1C: Enterprise"><br><br>  Another difficulty that has been encountered in practice is to access images. <br>  and files placed in the 1C information base.  The fact is that to store the file <br>  1C uses the Data Vault and Data Compression objects.  The database is placed <br>  not the contents of the file, but the serialization of 1C objects containing the file.  Difficulty <br>  It is solved by serializing and biting the necessary file from it. <br><br><h4>  Who is the master data </h4><br><br>  Direct access to 1C information database data creates a contradiction between legislation. <br>  Russian Federation and 1C: Enterprise license.  Some irresponsible persons <br>  without understanding the intricacies of the legislation, they mislead the rest <br>  society, claiming that direct access to 1C data is prohibited. <br><br>  The position of 1C regarding the direct access is as follows: "You can not access data <br>  information database directly, bypassing the level of objects of work with data "1C: Enterprise" <br>  - for example, with the help of DBMS. <br><br>  1C company, laying such items in the license, cunning and violates the law itself <br>  Of the Russian Federation, namely the articles: Article 1334 p.1 "The exclusive right of the manufacturer of the database" <br>  Of the Civil Code of the Russian Federation part 4, as well as Article 25 p.1 and p.3 ‚ÄúFree reproduction of programs for <br>  Computer and database.  Decompiling Computer Programs "Copyright Act and <br>  related rights.  The Civil Code states: <br><br>  "To the manufacturer of the database whose creation (including the processing or presentation <br>  relevant materials) requires substantial financial, material, organizational <br>  or other costs, has the exclusive right to extract from the database materials <br>  and implement their subsequent use in any form and by any means. ‚Äù <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br><br>  In conclusion, I would like to list some of the advantages offered in the article. <br>  technology based on the combination of two technologies Asp.Net and 1C: Enterprise.  Maximum <br>  The effect is achieved in unique projects that are written "from scratch". <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Saving money</b> - installing MSSql inside an organization is worth a lot <br>  money, and the Asp.Net database of the hosting provider is most often already included in the tariff <br>  hosting plan.  When publishing a website, you do not need to purchase numerous <br>  1C: Enterprise licenses for Internet users. </li><li>  <b>Save time</b> - <b>saving</b> users time provides <br>  Desktop application, which is 1C: Enterprise.  Work with data faster <br>  and more convenient through 1C than through the web interface. </li><li>  <b>Additional features 1C</b> - 1C provides additional <br>  opportunities for database administration, making life easier for developers.  To opportunities <br>  1C include: upload and download information database, conversion rules, plans <br>  sharing, tremendous reporting options.  The proposed solution, on the one hand being <br>  web interface, on the other hand, is a desktop application where you can <br>  use on the office side an infinite number of external 1C processings / responses <br>  for analyzing and changing data, trade equipment, GSM modems, etc. </li><li>  <b>Additional features Asp.Net</b> - technology Asp.Net adds <br>  In the solution, full control over Html rendering and interface design.  Web application <br>  permissible to make SEO-optimized with the addition of modern fashion technologies <br>  Web 2.0. </li><li>  <b>Responsibility</b> - in large projects it is easy to differentiate <br>  area of ‚Äã‚Äãresponsibility between employees: between 1C-department and .Net-developers. <br>  1C-department is engaged in the Desktop-interface, database support and export-import data, <br>  a .Net developers develop a website on Asp.Net. </li><li>  <b>Collecting information from several 1C databases</b> - the way allows writing <br>  rules for converting data for export and import so that data can <br>  arrive at a remote database from several work bases 1C: Accounting or 1C: Management <br>  trade organization or several organizations.  Distributed information <br>  bases will allow to connect several cities or to distribute the load on the server. </li></ul><br><hr></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/136415/">https://habr.com/ru/post/136415/</a></p>
