  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What was said about JavaScript in 1995</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  For many years, JavaScript has been the most popular programming language in the world.  Of course, one can argue with this, however, one can definitely say that this language has come a long way since <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/webed/wiki/A_Short_History_of_JavaScript">its birth in 1995</a> . <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3de/9c7/cb6/3de9c7cb6baa455bbee4e4f64b4cbe10.jpg" alt="image"></div><a name="habracut"></a><br>  What happened when, about twenty-one years ago, <a href="https://medium.com/%40BrendanEich">Brendan Eyck plunged</a> into creating a language that very, very many people now know and love?  Then the Simpson case was, as they say, on the ointment, then Ross and Rachel from ‚ÄúFriends‚Äù were seething with passion, then she was preparing to enter the big screen ‚ÄúToy Story‚Äù. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a1f/523/fcb/a1f523fcb4900bbc577eca7640f429f6.gif"></div><br>  Yes, and I also read on Wikipedia that 1995 is the year in which Internet service providers like AOL and Prodigy offered for the first time a mass service to access the World Wide Web.  At the same time, browsers came out that made web surfing accessible to the general public.

      In fact, it creates the feeling that then was the right time to create a programming language that was supposed to work in browsers. <br><br>  In order to report the release of JavaScript, the <a href="http:/wp.netscape.com/newsref/pr/newsrelease67.html">joint press release of</a> Netscape and Sun Microsystems was released on December 4, 1995.  It said that JavaScript would be an ‚Äúeasy to use‚Äù scripting language that was designed to "develop interactive online applications." <br><br>  This press release then went further, in response to it, the sharks of the IT industry of those times shared their thoughts on JavaScript.  Some companies that they represented still exist, and some do not.  Recall the words of these people. <br><blockquote>  JavaScript brought to the industry serious opportunities for rapid development of multimedia applications and cross-platform code portability at the operating system level and at the architectural level.  We are pleased to integrate this powerful language into our Developer Program project. </blockquote>  <i>Mike Connors, President, America Online Technologies</i> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a02/a62/7db/a02a627db908b24d0a0e0cd403a38934.gif"></div><br><blockquote>  JavaScript will allow us to simplify the creation of custom applets for the Excite service.  These applets, combined with rich Excite functionality, are more fully integrated into the processes of interaction with users during their work on the Internet. </blockquote>  <i>Graham Spencer, Technical Director, Architext Software</i> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/838/f11/6be/838f116be99954edb8b508c83e34d895.gif"></div><br><blockquote>  AT &amp; T supports JavaScript, and this is more than support for an interesting technology.  This is support for open standards.  Open standards, today and in the future, are just as important to the success of the Internet as the possibility of the free interconnection of the systems of which it is composed. </blockquote>  <i>Tom Evslin, Vice President, AT &amp; T</i> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fb2/ca9/c67/fb2ca9c677ffb886ceabdafa9d281da9.gif"></div><br><blockquote>  JavaScript and Java technologies are important steps in the evolution of the Internet and internal networks for business computing.  JavaScript makes it easy for Internet applications to connect to databases, such as CA-OpenIngres, while Java allows you to develop easy-to-use multiplatform web clients for CA-Unicenter and business applications, such as CA-Masterpiece, CA- ManMan / X and CA-Accpac. </blockquote>  <i>Nancy Lee, executive vice president and CTO, Computer Associates</i> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/956/6bd/b71/9566bdb71704c762eaa6f0c88cc3b46e.gif"></div><br><blockquote>  Tools like JavaScript will give a new wave of creativity and transform the Internet, turning it into a structure, the characteristics of which so far can only guess.  JavaScript and other similar developments will require increased computer performance.  Ideally, these new requirements will be consistent with the Digital Alpha system architecture. </blockquote>  <i>Rose Ann Giordano, Vice President, Digital Equipment Corporation</i> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e98/466/a6f/e98466a6f0c0b1d0ca483babdb1ac90d.gif"></div><br><blockquote>  JavaScript is a great technology, as it is the next generation of software designed specifically for the web.  Hewlett-Packard is committed to open standards and supports JavaScript, as this language complements our open systems architecture. </blockquote>  <i>Ian Silverman, Director, Hewlett-Packard</i> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9e1/b2c/db2/9e1b2cdb2780e06f27fb371a2c01e3a6.gif"></div><br><blockquote>  We plan to integrate our technology of automatic indexing and abstracting documents with JavaScript, which will allow us to use the rich functionality of this language.  Thanks to our technologies, server processing of documents and timely delivery of necessary materials to web clients are greatly expanded. </blockquote>  <i>Robert Griggs, Vice President, Iconovex Corporation</i> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/70d/1f5/351/70d1f5351c279cc1ffc310b094451378.gif"></div><br><blockquote>  JavaScript gives programmers the means to create powerful, multimedia-rich applications in a platform-independent development environment.  Illustra's unique extensible object-relational architecture makes it the ideal intelligent data repository that supports query technology for content management systems using Java and JavaScript objects. </blockquote>  <i>Dr. Michael Stounbraker, Founder and CTO, Illustra Information Technologies</i> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/47b/2b0/565/47b2b0565d43f8105ca06f58d4b5c073.gif"></div><br><blockquote>  The implementation of JavaScript will benefit users by allowing you to create interactive online applications.  These applications need powerful database systems to organize content management.  Informix OnLine Dynamic Server is great for these applications.  In partnership with Netscape, we will give web users the best of online databases and interactive technologies. </blockquote>  <i>Phil White, Chairman and CEO, Informix Software</i> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/923/f8c/94f/923f8c94f273e3da5f11fd799595b231.gif"></div><br><blockquote>  Intuit will take advantage of JavaScript and a wide range of Netscape tools to develop applications to create attractive online financial services.  Netscape's open, cross-platform environment allows Intuit to effectively develop and deploy online applications. </blockquote>  <i>Bill Harris, Executive Vice President, Intuit</i> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0ea/298/9b6/0ea2989b6f852b0bd8f7cc2d35583362.gif"></div><br><blockquote>  Using JavaScript is a great way to provide cross-platform scripted access to databases and transfer results to Macromedia Shockwave, where they can be processed before being displayed on the screen, animated, and turned into interactive multimedia content for the Internet.  JavaScript, in addition, is a promising core for technologies used in new tools for preparing multimedia content for publication, developed by Macromedia. </blockquote>  <i>Bad Colligan, President and CEO, Macromedia.</i> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/63c/5fe/917/63c5fe91752d199767e9858fe3ed82f5.gif"></div><br><blockquote>  Creating a generic scripting language for Java development will speed up the launch of this exciting new technology for delivering dynamic, interactive content to the consumer.  Metrowerks will support JavaScript as part of our initiatives to create tools for Java, the platform we have chosen to develop new Internet solutions. </blockquote>  <i>Greg Galanos, President and CEO, Metrowerks, Inc.</i> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/842/5f8/8f2/8425f88f22927b4f39a61ba593b6bf9a.gif"></div><br><blockquote>  Paper Software plans to use JavaScript as a link that will allow our development partners to integrate Java, plug-ins and multidimensional VRML Paper user interfaces into distributed online applications. </blockquote>  <i>Mike McKew, Director, Paper Software</i> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ee5/fb5/f2c/ee5fb5f2c4c1022db98e5a89686b2785.gif"></div><br><blockquote>  JavaScript is an excellent addition to the software developed by Perfect, which aims to support the transfer of real-time multimedia data on the Internet and in corporate networks.  Speaking as a means of integrating our products into web solutions, JavaScript will enable a wide range of web-based applications to use real-time audio and video data technologies. </blockquote>  <i>Judy Estrin, Precept Software</i> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/494/b80/3a1/494b803a1b43ee12b5eb0cca92ed9474.gif"></div><br><blockquote>  SCO is looking forward to incorporating JavaScript into its OpenServer and UnixWare product lines.  JavaScript will allow developers to create much more exciting and interactive web applications than ever before, giving them the latest technology that is needed in the battle for the attention of Internet users, who are becoming more demanding. </blockquote><br>  <i>Richard Treadway, Vice President, SCO</i> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0ab/f0f/40c/0abf0f40c5dc28ead1d90ae9d3ddd62e.gif"></div><br><blockquote>  JavaScript is exactly what the Silicon Graphics toolkit for creating content and developing applications is very useful.

We see it as a powerful tool for providing dynamic data output and organization of work on the client side with the results obtained from our Search and Agents platforms.  Customization is a key strength of Verity servers, and the availability of JavaScript gives ordinary users the perfect tool to use the capabilities of Java objects to customize the look and feel of their applications developed by Verity. </blockquote>  <i>Steve Zocchi, Director, Verity</i> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bf0/dd3/975/bf0dd39750c2865ece4546c9fcc2ea37.gif"></div><br><blockquote>  Client-server, multi-vendor, cross-platform nature of JavaScript is perfectly combined with the web authoring system Vermeer FrontPage.  Observing innovative, new-found Web technologies is one of Vermeer's top priorities, and we are quickly moving towards introducing JavaScript into FrontPage and our future developments. </blockquote>  <i>John R. Mundle, CEO, Vermeer Technologies.</i> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/187/b42/797/187b4279707cf4cd5b02dcecfd1ae0cd.gif"></div><br><h2>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Results</font> </h2><br>  All these statements from the early days of JavaScript are now more than twenty years old.
