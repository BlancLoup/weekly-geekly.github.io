But fossil fuels are running out, and alternative energy is not efficient enough yet. <br>  There is a method of obtaining energy that perfectly fits all the requirements - Thermonuclear fusion.  The reaction of thermonuclear fusion (the conversion of hydrogen to helium and the release of energy) constantly occurs in the sun and this process gives the planet energy in the form of solar rays.  It is only necessary to imitate it on Earth, on a smaller scale.  Enough to provide high pressure and very high temperature (10 times higher than on the sun) and the synthesis reaction will be launched.  To create such conditions, you need to build a fusion reactor.  It will use more common resources on earth, will be safer and more powerful than conventional nuclear power plants.  For more than 40 years, attempts have been made to build it and experiments are underway.  In recent years, one of the prototypes even managed to get more energy than was spent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Db-LCfx9v4YQ">1</a> .  The most ambitious projects in this area are presented below: <br><a name="habracut"></a>

This experimental reactor for $ 40 billion will not yet serve as a full-fledged power plant, but it will prove that thermonuclear energy is possible.  A coalition of countries, including Russia, should complete the construction of the reactor by 2026. <br>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/268658/">more</a> <br><br>  <b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Du-fbBRAxJNk">Wendelstein 7-X</a></b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/56e/b61/fae/56eb61fae7ab492fa0949cb83d8cdaba.jpg" width="800" height="500"><br><br>  Most public attention has recently been given to another design of a fusion reactor - the Wendelstein 7-X stellarator (the stellarator is more complex in its internal structure than ITER, which is the tokamak).  Having spent just over $ 1 billion, German scientists built a reduced demonstration model of the reactor by 2015 for 9 years.  If it shows good results, a larger version will be built. <br>  <a href="https://lenta.ru/articles/2015/12/11/wendelstein7x/">more</a> <b><br><br></b>  <b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DQXHpwuAdzVk">MegaJoule Laser</a></b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/16f/ccc/70d/16fccc70d12c4fe49496bc63acb3785c.jpg" width="800" height="500"><br><br>  MegaJoule Laser in France will be the most powerful laser in the world and will try to promote a laser-based fusion reactor construction method.

They expected to test the technology and then immediately build a reactor, but it turned out that, as reported by Wikipedia - reach ignition.  As a result, ambitious plans were canceled and scientists began to gradually improve the laser.  The last task is to raise the energy transfer efficiency from 7% to 15%.  Otherwise, funding from the congress of this method of achieving synthesis may cease. <br>  <a href="https://lenta.ru/articles/2016/03/03/fusion/">more</a> <br><br>  <b><a href="http://tass.ru/nauka/1831364">Installation in Sarov</a></b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d4a/e0c/777/d4ae0c777af349998e40dfc980cedcf3.jpg" width="800" height="500"><br><br>  At the end of 2015, the construction of a building for the world's most powerful laser facility began in Sarov.  It will be more powerful than the current American and future French and will allow to conduct the experiments necessary for the construction of a "laser" version of the reactor.

Recently, this method has shown better results than expected, but the power still needs to be increased 1,000 times.  Now the laser is undergoing an upgrade, and by 2018, scientists hope to get as much energy as they spent.  If successful, an enlarged version will be built. <br>  <a href="http://atomicexpert.com/content/%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0-%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0-%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D1%258F%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B9-%25D1%258D%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9">more</a> <br><br>  <b><a href="">Institute of Nuclear Physics</a></b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a40/54a/8b6/a4054a8b6f4b46ff9b4fcc94c13a1728.jpg" width="800" height="500"><br><br>  In the Russian INP persistently conducted experiments on the method of "open traps" that was abandoned by the United States in the 90s.  As a result, indicators were obtained that were considered impossible for this method.

Before the construction of huge reactors and lasers, all the news about fusion were like that.  One would have thought that this was just a competition among scientists ‚Äî who would keep the temperature higher and longer.  The higher the temperature of the plasma and the longer it can be kept - the closer we are to the start of the fusion reaction.  There are dozens of such installations in the world, a few more ( <a href="http://www.jt60sa.org/b/index.htm">1</a> ) ( <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/243445/">2</a> ) are being built so that the EAST record will soon be broken.

They rely on new technologies that appeared after the construction of giant tokamaks began and promise to carry out the project in 10 years.  It is unknown whether they will be given the green light at the start of construction.

A hybrid thermonuclear reactor will receive energy both from the decay of an atom (like a normal nuclear power plant) and from synthesis.  In this configuration, the energy can be 10 times more, but security is lower.  China expects to build a prototype by 2030, but experts say it's like trying to build hybrid cars before the invention of the internal combustion engine. <br>  <a href="https://lenta.ru/news/2015/07/17/china/">more</a> <br><br><h1>  Total </h1><br>  There is no shortage of those who want to bring a new source of energy into the world.  The ITER project has the greatest chances, given its scale and financing, but other methods as well as private projects should not be discounted.  Scientists have worked for decades to launch a fusion reaction without much success.  But now there are more projects to achieve thermonuclear reaction than ever.  Even if each of them fails, new attempts will be made.  It is unlikely that we will calm down until we light a miniature version of the Sun, here on Earth. </habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/396961/">https://habr.com/ru/post/396961/</a></p>
