  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Thirteenth paragraph</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> <b>Thirteenth paragraph</b> <br><br>  The measured working day was interrupted by a bell at the door, sharp as a banshee scream. <br>  ‚ÄúDamn it, how many times has Harry told you that you need to change this damn call, my brains go to my back every time customers come to us!‚Äù <br>  ‚ÄúYou will call ...‚Äù my colleague from across the room replied phlegmatically. <br>  The doorbell rang again.  And further. <br>  - Yes, what is he doing?  I'll go see who it is there is so persistent - I pushed the chair and headed for the front door. There was a strange smell in the hall.  I mechanically scratched my nose, escaping from rubbing ... Sulfur ... Similarly, it smelled gray, and it was almost impossible to breathe near the door.  I already knew who it was from the morning that came to our office, because such stinks could only come from one creature in this Universe ... <br>  I threw open the door and looked hard at the visitor ... On the threshold stood the devil.  The most natural, with horns, hooves and tail, and also in a decent suit from a fashionable designer and with a leather diplomat.  He looked at me from the bottom to the top and grinned with the skill of a lively salesman. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  - Whats up?  ‚ÄúUsually I‚Äôm not so rude, especially with potential clients, but you know what the hell‚Äôs reputation is.‚Äù  You let one in the office and write disappeared, sign the contract and stay without the last pants.  Maybe more should. <br>  The early guest was completely embarrassed by my tone, and the smile on the contrary became even wider.  Looking at his physiognomy, I was sure that it was impossible, there would be no cosmetic magic trick. <br>  -Good morning!  - the devil even spoke in the voice of the seller from some cheap consumer advertising - I represent ‚ÄúCorporation of Good‚Äù, let me present you our new product!  Absolutely unique thing.  This is a crystal ball for faster and more convenient navigation in the astral; now all plans and dimensions of being will appear on your table many times faster than it happens in the balls of our competitors!  - he chattering so that I did not have time to insert a word. <br>  - "Corporation of Good"?!  Since when does your brother cooperate with them?  I thought you had an exclusive contract with ‚ÄúMicrospell‚Äù - In fact, ‚ÄúThe Corporation of Good‚Äù produced really high-quality and convenient products, I myself enjoyed their astral services - your image doesn‚Äôt correspond to a few ... <br>  - ABOUT!  These prejudices, believe it all remained in the last century.  Now we successfully cooperate with the ‚ÄúCorporation of Good‚Äù to promote its products to the new market.  By the way, my name is Charlie Hell, sales manager.  I see you are already interested, let me tell you about the new crystal ball in more detail ...- continuing to speak, Charlie unobtrusively pushed me away from the door, trying to get into the office.  Being taken aback by such impudence, I lowered my hand holding the door and the devil, taking advantage of the moment of my weakness, slipped inside. <br>  - It would be better if you invited your colleagues and of course the boss.  It is necessary to explain why his employees move to the use of a new, improved version of the ball. <br>  ‚ÄúThe boss is not there, the rest are in the office ... Let's go - resigned to fate, I slammed the door and led Charlie to the main office.  Despite such a big name, our office actually consisted of one working room, where two of my colleagues and myself, actually, were huddled together. <br>  - Guys - I called out to fellow magicians when we entered the room with the devil - Meet Charlie Hell, sales manager at the Corporation of Good.  Charlie, this is Doug ... <br>  Doug, one of the few "naturals" in our profession.  And this definition does not concern his sexual orientation at all (I prefer not to go into this jungle at all), it just works directly with the primordial elements.  The usual set is Water, Air, Earth, Fire. <br>  Doug nodded grimly and grimaced.  Sulfur stink managed to flood the entire room. <br>  - ‚ÄúCorporation of Good‚Äù, wow!  - on the face of Maple, a guy who had practice with us from the nearest magic school, a real puppy delight was written. <br>  -This is Maple ... - I barely managed to beat this nimble fellow, a fan of the "Corporation" <br>  - Well, come on, Charlie, tell me, just quickly, we still have a lot of work ... - as if to confirm my words, I nodded at a magic wand lying on the table, for which I had to write a couple more spells.  I flopped into my chair and spread my arms, giving Charlie complete freedom <br>  - So, gentlemen, today you are truly lucky - Hell opened his diplomat and drew a crystal ball from there, in appearance it almost did not differ from those that were on our table - Today, "The Corporation of Good" will present its new product.  If the astral had top and bottom, they would have changed places, so good is our new ball.  In order not to be verbose, let me demonstrate clearly ... <br>  Charlie ran his hand over the surface of the ball and stretched it forward so that we could see better.  Pictures of the astral plane began to form inside the crystal.  And they did it with amazing speed ... - Charlie stood and smiled, enjoying the effect produced, read on our faces.  Even Doug, a gloomy magician with experience, was interested. <br>  - Pay attention to the speed of display of knowledge!  Tests have shown that of the crystal balls of all manufacturers on the market, ours is the fastest.  This applies to almost everything, including scenarios for processing astral twists and visions in visions ... <br>  Charlie Hell gave a few more examples.  Damn ball really worked exceptionally fast. <br>  - And most importantly ... - Charlie sustained a theatrical pause - ... This ball is available to users for free! <br>  I was again tormented by doubts, it is known where there is free cheese.  The ball was too good.  Yes, and I do not believe the devil! <br>  And Charlie already crammed the first ball to Maple, having precisely defined the weakest place in our defense.  The guy was already piercing his finger to put his signature under the User Agreement ... <br>  - Well, ka stand!  - I did not have time only for a moment, a drop of blood touched the paper.  The contract was secured ... The flirting smile on Charlie's face was replaced by a triumphant one.  A demonic laugh is about to break out, straight from Hell ... <br>  - Though I would read first!  - I reproachfully looked at Maple and pulled the Agreement out of his hands.  Delving into reading the contract, I mumbled something about my studies and wasted time. <br>  - So, what's that ?!  - I pointed at the thirteenth paragraph of the Agreement - Something in my tone made Charlie back down, a smile slowly slipped from her polished face ...- Well, come here, damn hoofed.  What am I asking you for ?! <br>  ‚ÄúThe Creator retains the copyright in his Creation.  The Corporation of Good receives the full, exclusive right to own the immortal soul of Creation.  All thoughts and feelings of Creation, transmitted through the astral plane by means of the crystal ball of the ‚ÄúCorporation of Good‚Äù, can be used by the ‚ÄúCorporation of Good‚Äù at its discretion ... ‚Äù <br>  -No, well, you are completely insolent!  Soul on a crystal ball change ?!  I understand the omnipotence or eternal life at last, but on the ball ?!  Soul ?!  - I started to attack Hella, the cunning manager, having felt my voice, grabbed my suitcase and tried to pull the Agreement out of my hands ... <br>  -Give up, my bastard!  He signed!  By blood!  Everything is legal! <br>  I stretched my arms forward and pulled the sheet by the edges ... Where there, the blood-signed Agreement cannot be broken <br>  Charlie burst into demonic laughter and ran to the door, tapping some completely insane melody with his hoofs ... <br>  - See you in court, neophytes!  Haha ...- with these words, Charlie Hell hid behind the door ... <br>  - Lawlessness ... - I returned to the room, to my colleagues - Doug, well, go to the astral plane, you need to raise the public, write to the archmage, with popular manuscripts.  It is unlikely it will come out that the thirteenth paragraph is removed, at least changed the wording ... </div>
