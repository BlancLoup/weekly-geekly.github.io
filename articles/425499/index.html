Or why in a laptop 64 GB of memory with a frequency of 3200 MHz?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  For untrained users, the purchase of such a high-frequency memory in the SO-DIMM form factor may seem like a strange decision, but, in fact, such a move can be justified in several scenarios of using a laptop or mini-PC.  And in this material we will not focus on synthetics - only real applications and games! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pb/0t/gy/pb0tgytloqur4bpdnxvqmzgause.jpeg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Immediately I must say about the available options for <a href="http://hyperx.gg/HABRHyperXImpactDDR4">HyperX Impact DDR4</a> .  4, 8, and 16 GB modules are available on the market, either alone or in sets of 2 or 4 pieces.  Clock frequencies can also be chosen - from 2133 to 3200 MHz.  Not all combinations are available (for example, there is no option of four 3200 MHz modules and some others), but everyone will be able to find an option to suit their needs. <br><br>  The first question that worries you is - but where to put such a memory?  Indeed - the options are not so much.

      First, there are motherboards with slots for SO-DIMM memory.  The most interesting option is ASRock's X299E-ITX / ac.  This model can accommodate four DDR4 modules of the specified format with almost no frequency limits - at least 4000 MHz.  At the output, you can get a first-class gaming or working system with an overclocked 18-core processor, a GeForce RTX 2080 Ti video card and 64 GB of memory with a frequency of 3200 MHz, which is HyperX Impact DDR4.  By the way, there are practically no analogues of such memory in the Russian market at the retail sale - sometimes only single offers skip. <br><br>  Secondly, gaming laptops can work with HyperX Impact DDR4.  Those that are really game, and not just in the title.  Here it is worth adding that such configurations can be used not only for games.  For example, it may be a portable workstation, which does not require a long battery life, but so that it can be transferred between rooms or taken on long working trips.  In our case, this laptop was the model <a href="https://www.asus.com/ru/Laptops/ROG-G703/">Chimera G703 from ASUS ROG</a> . <br><br>  Thirdly, investing in such a memory can be a start for the future.  If after some time it is planned to update the platform, but high-frequency memory will not lose its relevance.  And the situation with prices on the world market is such that the cost of memory will only grow.  Unless some miracle happens.  But this is a topic of a completely different material. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-o/ii/to/-oiito73iyk3nw5zixeporgzh5m.jpeg"><br><br>  Your next question is: why do we need such a volume, and even with such a high frequency? <br><br>  It could be answered simply - for everything.  But that would not be entirely fair.  To demonstrate the advantages of high-frequency memory modules, many compare the single-channel mode and the dual-channel mode, but look at the results of synthetic tests, which, although illustrative, are of little interest to anyone.  In this material, we show a comparison of performance in real use.  After all, buying the same laptop with GTX 1080 on board you will not play at the minimum or medium settings?  Also, like working in Paint or in standard Windows video editor. <br><br>  Do not forget that many of us prefer to run the game when the browser is open in the background with a couple dozen tabs that do not sin to take up enough space in the RAM.  But modern games can easily use 10 gigabytes of memory and more - the operating system needs to transfer part of the data to the system SSD, which ultimately boils down to performance loss.  So 16 GB of RAM in modern realities is not so much. <br><br><h2>  Let's move from words to deeds. </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/2q/mk/am/2qmkamzzlg_lfbi3kllgcbozkkq.jpeg"><br><br>  We decided to place two sets for testing in a ASUS ROG Chimera laptop (G703VI). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-g/kp/qv/-gkpqvp9kn6hx8ky5v41yro7x-c.png"><br><br>  For lovers of detailed information - a screenshot from Thaiphoon Burner. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xx/cq/nh/xxcqnhrcfnrynfpqq8zpvh0bm_q.png"><br><br>  The read / write / copy speeds are very, very high - a gain relative to the ‚Äústandard‚Äù 2133 MHz models - about 20-25%. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ro/y7/cz/roy7cz-mibvabwmcteg4kmphkyw.png"><br><br>  But we are interested in tests in real games and applications, is not it?  In all cases, the settings were set to the maximum available in the settings menu. <br><br>  In Battlefield V, there is a noticeable increase in the minimum and average number of frames in both FullHD and 4K resolution.  Online shooters respond well to an increase in the amount of memory itself, and to its frequency. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-c/-b/su/-c-bsu7imevcxcurua2gy-kcg1o.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sd/q0/s5/sdq0s5ubjqtvarun_hsnqustarm.png"><br><br>  The adventures of Lara Croft in the newest Shadow of the Tomb Raider have not done without increasing productivity, although its increase was insignificant. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-u/8e/vc/-u8evc5yb8wqqpccsfelgjnrtvi.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vo/wu/so/vowuso9-xvrjlevvlxtppxhdet8.png"><br><br>  Racing simulator Project Cars 2 responds to both the increase in memory and its frequency. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yw/4y/qo/yw4yqos6uharl_pbspob6nka1ww.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cn/jd/8v/cnjd8vsqo-1c5ry6wyswosgpru4.png"><br><br>  Those who are struggling with Far Cry 5 fanatics will also be rewarded with some increase in productivity. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0s/uq/pw/0suqpwnhqwqwhg4rnp-w1mrbx-w.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mp/kb/kw/mpkbkwdfffpuhhvjyttyjpojodw.png"><br><br>  The frame rate during running and shootouts in GTA V (Online) slightly increased. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ai/aw/af/aiawafpctohbwo4-w93b9coatms.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0c/ge/tx/0cgetxi2zlnp7yqbymey_ky4v2o.png"><br><br>  A noticeable increase can be fixed in Star Wars: Battlefront II - in a multiplayer shooter with massive fighting. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-w/gn/9n/-wgn9nmh6gaatstwkxfgsep7fwu.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rl/ns/ja/rlnsjal3ngtv8cf_v6mgowntt4g.png"><br><br>  Well, now imagine that we work with photos or videos and use professional editors that are commercially available. <br>  Adobe Premiere Pro CC 2018 responds to memory configuration changes.  At first glance it may seem that the increase is insignificant, but after all, a video clip of only 30 seconds duration took part in the testing! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wn/hu/dw/wnhudwpcu7f4z5tit5npuobijhg.png"><br><br>  Processing a 10-minute video (added a grain effect) takes almost half an hour with the simplest memory configuration, and with an increase in volume and frequency, the result can be improved by a few minutes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/k4/o1/td/k4o1tdanpryxh86xtx2imxa9xjw.png"><br><br>  But After Effects CC 2018 from the same Adobe shows a completely different result.  When rendering the program, everything runs through the RAM, so if caching to disk is disabled, the increase will be enormous from the increase in the amount of memory itself. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ge/y0/db/gey0dbjwu9_b1isprsvl9gkdz-y.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/7j/wg/mb/7jwgmb0rpqyp2l11qrgt63l9g-8.png"><br><br>  Of course, the frequency also affects the time of the task.  And this is especially evident when rendering longer clips, even if it is just a minute video. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cx/rk/d_/cxrkd_1yz81nrkimczgbcjn_5no.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/aa/kx/if/aakxifnpmql-qvfcbisahl6fw8k.png"><br><br>  In the software package Photoshop CC 2018, the speed of the task is more dependent on the frequency of the memory.  But it can also depend on the volume, if the participation takes a large number of images in high resolution. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yq/pu/xc/yqpuxcqd-gnvh-tfkgfk6zttljs.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-r/l9/52/-rl952muw56gdj-ozb5kvh7llmu.png"><br><br>  Well, where is really important the amount of memory and its frequency - in professional packages for visualizing effects with a huge number of particles.  For example, take Houdini FX from SideFx.  This package sets special requirements for fluid visualization - each frame can be built for more than 10 minutes!  And here, doubling the amount of RAM leads to almost doubling the performance.  And the increase in frequency reduces the visualization time even more.  Notice - the time is in minutes, not in seconds.  That is, in the first case, you can shorten the execution time from 62 hours to 21 hours only when rendering a short video with a total length of 120 frames. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/c-/gv/10/c-gv10relkta88czkp-6zk-6cbc.png"><br><br>  And if the scene is more difficult, then instead of a week you complete the task in less than 3 days.  For example, take the drop of the same water drop, but on the water surface.  The calculation will be much more difficult - each frame will be drawn longer, because you only need to process a drop first, and then the entire water surface. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rx/kx/aw/rxkxawp_nxlnotspltr--rvtmu8.png"><br><br><h2>  Anything else? </h2><br>  Yes, there is still something to say.  HyperX Impact DDR4 memory is designed to work with the latest Intel and AMD processors.  The correct set will automatically start on the declared specifications, which minimizes the risk of incorrect manual configuration.  In the case of high-frequency options, Intel XMP profiles help to simplify setup - a couple of clicks and your system works in the mode you need.  It should be noted that the modules even with a frequency of 3200 MHz operate at an operating voltage of 1.2 V, which reduces their heating.  This is useful in both laptops and compact PCs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_m/du/zx/_mduzxj4ltkj-6ehl4vvniv52ok.jpeg"><br><br><h2>  Conclusion </h2><br>  High-frequency memory can not be called a waste of money.  Of course, it is somewhat more expensive than ‚Äústandard‚Äù solutions, but in certain cases it saves a tremendous amount of time to perform complex tasks.  The volume is also important - there is generally a separate story related, in particular, to heavy applications - in such cases it is an improvement in the RAM that can save the funds that were originally planned for the upgrade of the entire system.  Or if you like to run several applications at the same time, many tabs in the browser, and in addition to the modern game.  As for HyperX Impact DDR4, everything is extremely simple - despite the rather narrow range of platforms with SO-DIMM support, the choice of module options is large, and there are practically no competitors.  But this does not mean at all that prices are higher than anywhere else - they are the same or even lower than those of other manufacturers. <br>  The answers to these questions are as follows.  Is there a profit from high frequency memory?  Yes there is.  Is there a profit from increasing the memory?  Yes there is.  Especially in difficult tasks.  All this was once again confirmed in this material.  If you doubted your decision in terms of upgrading the RAM, then after studying the test results, all the questions should be removed.  You can find out the exact <a href="http://hyperx.gg/HABRHyperXImpactDDR4">cost and availability</a> in the stores of HyperX partners. <br><br>  For more information about HyperX products, visit <a href="https://bit.ly/2mdGrDZ">the company's</a> official <a href="https://bit.ly/2mdGrDZ">website</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/425499/">https://habr.com/ru/post/425499/</a></p>
