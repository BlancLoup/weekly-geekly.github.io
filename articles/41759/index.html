      Any system goes through 3 life stages.  And it does not matter what the system is: the growth of bacteria in a bowl of broth, the development of aircraft construction or the life of an ordinary person - the stages are essentially the same, and differ only in details. <br><br>  Let's look at them on the example of the ‚Äúwebsite creation‚Äù market: <br><br>  <b>1. Becoming.</b>  At this stage, site builders only grope their way.  No standards - sheer creativity.  Each product (site) is not like the others.  The incompatibility of ‚Äúparts and assemblies‚Äù of one product with others is often encountered.  Each new project starts from scratch, there is no talk about using standard blocks and tools. <br><br>  Sites are few, they can make units.  Users who go through the sites are also extremely few.  Money for sites often do not pay - they are made by enthusiasts to meet personal ambitions. <br><br>  But gradually the sites become more and more, the market is defined with basic standards, the number of Internet users is growing, and the number of site builders is catching up. <br><br>  <b>2. Development.</b>  Often this stage is divided into 2 sub-stages - the first and second parts. <br><br>  <i>The first part of the second stage:</i> <br>  The market is growing, the number of orders is growing.  This encourages site builders to standardize what they are doing - to give birth to a hedgehog every time, it is easier to make standard blocks of quality once, which can be used in new projects with minor changes in the future. <br><br>  Labor productivity is increasing.  At this stage, leaders begin to stand out - those who, before others, were able to rebuild cottage industry into a small manufactory. <br><br>  <i>The second part of the second stage:</i> <br>  The market is growing significantly.  Well-known (and simply high-quality) manufacturers are torn apart by orders.  They are fenced off from this by high and super high prices for their products.  Someone from clients overcomes this qualification - and gets a site for 50-100 kilobaksov.  Someone falls off - and becomes the prey of small and medium-sized studios, which by that time had also switched to standard CMS of their own or third-party production and, in fact, offer customers standard solutions, drawing on their (sometimes still unique) design. <br><br>  At the same time, revolutionary new technologies do not appear - there is a familiar set of tools, interface elements and expectations from the user, on the basis of which twin sites appear, and the site for 1k bucks differs from the site for 10k mainly in the studio's ability to apply. <br><br>  Those who have not switched to standard development tools - quietly rot, go into the deep niches of specialized sites or ... begin a new cycle of the new system in a completely new field. <br><br>  <b>3. Stagnation, stagnation.</b> <br>  The market stops growing.  Outwardly, it is still very good - sites are ordered, large studios are still distinguished by megatariffs, there is food for small and medium-sized market participants.  But prices are steadily falling - this is the fruit of tough competition, when studios really have nothing to stand out in the market for standard solutions, except as a price.  At the same time, the costs for the production of the site (mainly due to the RFP) are steadily increasing - which means that the meaning of engaging in this activity is lost. <br><br>  The prudent ones do not wait for the 3rd stage, but, starting from the second part of the second stage, a new line of activity will start, using the accumulated resources: financial, personnel, etc.  Where to go, everyone determines for himself.  But in fact, we see that the bulk goes to the CEO and the creation of traffic-generating projects "for themselves." <br><br>  The third stage may last long enough, but in the end the market, in the form to which everyone is accustomed, will face inevitable death. <br><br>  So where is the blonde's place at this celebration of life?  This is a very important point. <br><br>  The emergence of spam about the site for 1000 rubles and blondes behind the racks, making sites in 15 minutes is a clear sign of the transition of the market to the 3rd stage.  This transition does not occur ‚Äúat the click of the fingers‚Äù; it takes more than one month - but it happens. <br><br>  Megastantizedness and hyper-cheapness are indicators of a mature market, in which only those who become even more widespread, simpler and more accessible can earn real money. <br><br>  Are you surprised by a blonde who makes websites in 15 minutes and 100 bucks?  Wait for the ‚Äúsites for your family for free, in 5 minutes, in each pack Galina Blanca‚Äù. <br><br>  You do not want or do not know how to work in the market where they rule site-building McDonalds?  Get out of here. <br><br>  And yet: here we are together laughing at the blonde - and let's laugh at her masters, who, for example, have 20 such points, each of which sculpts 5 sites a day.  In this case, the blonde salary is not at all the salary of the programmer or designer.  Non-awkward will easily calculate the earnings of such a McDonald's for a month, even taking into account the cost of renting in a shopping center. <br><br>  Soul protests against the domination of the bubble and the decay of the true art of creating these sites?  How long have you been in a good restaurant where true masters of their craft are preparing masterpieces of culinary art? <br><br>  A pie at the entrance when they bought? <br><br>  That's it.  And it is naive to expect that consumers of your products - sites - will behave differently, and not in the way that you are in relation to restaurants and pies. <br><br>  <b>Summary:</b> <br>  The goal of this topic is not to protect blondes and site-building consumer goods.  Everything is much deeper.  The people on Habr√© are mostly young.  Theories of systems development in schools and institutes are not taught, and from this point of view, the majority of habravchan people do not have experience in analyzing the surrounding space.  But it is necessary to learn this - at least those who want to roll the world, and not run with him. <br><br>  Looking at particular - learn to see in it a part of the whole.  Find yourself in relation to this whole - after all, your life is determined <b>by the same</b> laws of systems development, and you have a lot to do while you are at the beginning of the second stage. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/41759/">https://habr.com/ru/post/41759/</a></p>
