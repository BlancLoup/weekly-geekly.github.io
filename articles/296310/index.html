This is especially true of your employees.  You think that they, too, MUST sit up to the night, love customers and just love to work.  After all, they touch the great and beautiful offspring. <br><br>  But immediately to recruit a dream team that will work smoothly and efficiently is very difficult (or rather, almost impossible). <br><br>  We share our experience and problems that we faced while forming the dream team.

This is both strength and danger. <br>  On the one hand, you do not need inventories, warehouses, but only people who know how to work.  You need geniuses - the same as you.  On the other hand, it can give employees an easy and natural way to divert your business.  For example, for legal consulting of the outcome history, whole departments are far from uncommon. <br><br>  Therefore, the owner, understanding the risks, is faced with a choice: to gain strengths and develop them (realizing the risk of going into ‚Äúfree swimming‚Äù) or to recruit very medium, but easily manageable ones (which definitely will not go away). <br><br>  Everyone chooses his own way for himself, but by working with strong ones you will definitely bring the business up (albeit with risks, but where without it). <br><br>  <i>How to protect yourself?</i> <br><br>  If you decide to pump an ambitious employee to the level of "genius", it would be wise to conclude a student agreement that will oblige the employee to work a certain amount of time after paying for training (advanced training).  In the case of dismissal at the initiative of the employee, he reimburses the costs of training. <br><br><h3>  Problem number 2: find an employee </h3><br>  An ambitious employee or passive, you must first find it.  You start searching and think only about quickly closing a job and starting to work?  Wrong train of thought. <br><br>  First you need to wade through the "thorns" of the resume, which contains imaginary experience, and sometimes education, no cover letters (if the resource on which the resume is posted requires a cover letter, applicants put any symbol or greeting).  You will receive resumes that do not correspond to vacancies - not by name (we received resumes of ‚Äúmanagers‚Äù, ‚Äúdrivers‚Äù and even ‚Äúshooters‚Äù for a lawyer‚Äôs vacancy). <br><br>  Assigning an interview time, be prepared for the fact that the applicant will not get in touch or, having already received the offer, will not go to work.  And it will be quite adequate at first glance people.  But this is a question of education, of course.  It happens that applicants for a courier or cleaning job do more tactfully than a leading lawyer. <br><br>  By the way, once a guy with a real work experience of no more than one year came to us for an interview.  At the same time, he worked in the last 4 months in a very large and well-known consulting company as a leading lawyer!  It turned out that, desperate to look for work with a little work experience, he ‚Äúpainted‚Äù the experience at 5 years old, read a couple of cases and impressed the employer.  True, the real work did not work and we had to part. <br><br>  <i>How to protect yourself?</i> <br><br>  Perhaps only check and try.  Before you take a candidate for a job, do not be lazy to look at his profiles in social networks (you can find many interesting things) and collect recommendations.  Yes, it is their profiles and profiles of their friends that will tell more and more truthfully than a summary. <br><br>  By the way, a short test task will also not be superfluous.  But it, alas, still does not guarantee.  If accepted for work, be sure to set a trial period.  Remember that he can not be more than 3 months (except for some posts for which he can reach 6). <br><br><h3>  Problem number 3: they leave with a trade secret </h3><br>  Developments in consulting is an extremely important thing.  Document templates, internal regulations, algorithms, checklists for the processes - all this makes the work more efficient. <br><br>  That is why customers go to those who have already worked with similar cases - they know not only theory, but they know how to circumvent the pitfalls. <br>  Well, the client base, of course, a valuable asset. <br><br>  And if, one day, all this comes up among competitors, it will be unpleasant.  But it happens ... <br><br>  <i>How to protect yourself?</i> <br><br>  Introduce a commercial secret regime in the company in order to discourage the desire to transfer ‚Äúsecrets‚Äù, and, if desired, sue such a double agent. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/552/8ec/ed4/5528eced47854d9694c0a0408cabe916.jpg"><br><br><h3>  Problem number 4: they become competitors </h3><br>  Do you remember the joke about the employee who, after a while, told the boss ‚ÄúI push the button alone, and we divide the profit in half‚Äù?  In an employee's life, a feeling of injustice arises very easily.  He suddenly begins to think that customers come themselves, the brand arises quickly, and profits will definitely flow like a river.  And if so, why work for someone? <br><br>  And at first, he stops working for your company (starts to break deadlines, forget about the tasks), and after debriefing he says he wants to leave.  Wait: in a couple of weeks it will appear on the horizon as the head of a new rival mirror company. <br><br>  <i>How to protect yourself?</i> <br><br>  No way.  I am glad that we managed to inspire someone to new achievements.  And feel sorry for him, who entered the terrible world of his own business without days off, vacations and generally a normal work schedule.  Then take pride of yourself, because it was you who taught him everything, and to work on. <br><br><h3>  Problem number 5: they go to customers </h3><br>  This happens often: first, he leads this client, and then goes to the inhouse (realizing that consulting is completely ‚Äúnot his‚Äù).  In general, there is nothing terrible in this - and this happens.  Although sometimes it can be an abuse by a client who has lured away your employee, in whom you have invested time, effort and money (you are growing geniuses, remember?). <br><br>  <i>How to protect yourself?</i> <br><br>  First, part with all worthy.  If the employee left, he did not become your enemy.  Look for the advantages in this situation, and again rejoice for the employee and for the client too.  Secondly, provide in the contract with the client mutual obligations not to take the former employees of each other. <br><br><h3>  Epilogue </h3><br>  All these "starchilki" pays off.  You will understand this when you manage to find people really interested in the work.  Then joint activity turns into pleasure.  If you choose the right team, then the office will have no place for empty conversations, complaints and waiting hours.  But finding a dream is very difficult.  We hope you will be able to pick up the very same team that, together with you, will lead the company to new heights. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296310/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296310/</a></p>
