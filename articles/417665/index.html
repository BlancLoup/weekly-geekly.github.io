  <section class="page js-page"><h1>English grammar as mathematics. Where to start for those who did not work out</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> English grammar is amazing for its simplicity.  It is very difficult not to love her: almost everything is logical, structured, understandable, if you know (of course).  This is not a Russian, where you can say anything as you like, but it also has its own charm.  Therefore, it always seems to me that nature simply shouts to people with a mathematical mindset that it is necessary to learn English and for them it is easy.  Of course, of course, any exceptions, where without them, but in general, everything is logical. <br>  Let's say they decided, found some kind of motivation.  So how do you get started, where to go?  From the alphabet?  With irregular verbs?  With pronunciation?  You can approach as much as you like, but if your goal is to speak, it will be best to approach the teacher.  If you cannot personally approach the teacher, come here. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jo/51/wt/jo51wtmnurwe0zpoz3mgdczsok8.jpeg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  When you work with a teacher, you do not need to know the alphabet, the types of reading letters in the first lesson, the teacher tells you, and you repeat, that is, you hear by ear how children learn to speak.  <b>Therefore, we must begin with suggestions.</b>  The brain is so comfortable. <br>  I like it when they say at the first lesson those who: ‚ÄúI tried a hundred times, but still nothing‚Äù.  I conclude with the following plan: personal pronouns, be + adjectives (then of course they need to be put together into sentences).  Google to help make yourself a selection or take it ready. <br>  Next is the most important thing. <br>  There are a number of simple rules, knowing that initially you will have a different attitude to English. <br>  So, the "golden" rules or magic rules, with which I advise you to begin acquaintance with English. <br>  1. <b>In English there are no sentences without a verb.</b>  An exclamation - maybe, but not an independent sentence.  Want to learn English - rebuild.  Suggestions of type: Late.  I'm at home.  Coldly.  - there's no such thing.  (‚ÄúWhat then?‚Äù - a little later.) So, the verb is all over the head. <br><br>  2. The reverse side of the coin: also does not exist without a subject proposal.  Leave impersonal sentences in Russian (‚ÄúIt's dark. Cold. Killed!‚Äù) <b>In English, it is crucial that there is someone in the sentence who performs this action.</b> <br><br>  3. Hence the following rule: there is no sentence without a grammatical basis.  Remember in school: subject, predicate, addition, and more.  So here, in English, no one has canceled.  And most importantly - it is super-important.  In the first place in the statement is the subject, followed by the predicate (that is, the verb).  Let's go back to ‚ÄúDark.  Too late.  I'm at home.  Coldly".  In the English version: It's got dark (= it became dark).  It's late (= it is late).  I'm at home (= I'm at home).  It's cold (= it is cold).  <b>There is no basis (subject + predicate), you are not understood.</b>

      4. Next: not always the Russian sentence can be translated literally.  "And he is so - on" will not fit in the "English head."  <b>Transform</b> : start with the subject, then the predicate, then everything else.  When you want to say something in English, linger for a second, rearrange the words in your head.  Then you will understand.  I often hear: ‚ÄúI was in London, nobody understood me.  I tell them, I tell them, but they do not understand. ‚Äù  The root of the problem is in word order, word order, if you want.  Especially if you talk a lot and quickly, the order of words will make you understand exactly what ... In 100% of cases my runner‚Äôs when they want to say: ‚ÄúI have a cat,‚Äù they ask: ‚ÄúAnd how will I have and have ?  There is no sentence in English that would begin with "me."  Not.  ‚ÄúHow, then?‚Äù - And then it is necessary to transform: I have = I have - here we have both the subject and the predicate. <br><br>  5. Separate magic rule is the order of words in the question.  Write yourself somewhere large in Russian "word order" or in English "word order" and repeat as a prayer if you want to be understood (and by the way, this will be easier with time). <br>  Keep in mind a small but very necessary sign to ask any question *: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zf/lh/wy/zflhwyxzpmqwr7onkoeswvgqq9u.jpeg"><br>  * there are questions that start with Who / What <br>  The question is, on what position will this ‚ÄúWho?‚Äù The correct answer is on both 0 and 2. There are two types of questions with ‚ÄúWho?‚Äù: Who / what is it? / Who did this? / Who is your best friend?  In this case, Who is standing at 2 positions, as this is the subject.  And since this is a subject, we do not use the auxiliary verb (it‚Äôs impossible to say 1 after 2), but we use the semantic verb in the necessary form. <br>  The second option is different from the Russian version: ‚ÄúWho are you with there?‚Äù Who are you there with?  Since in English the positions of the words in the question are fixed, we cannot start the question with ‚Äúwith‚Äù. <br>  ** adverbs and adjectives also have their own word order, although the ‚Äúunderstanding‚Äù of what you are saying is no longer reflected, it will simply speak about your language level: <br>  Adverbs: how - where - when <br>  Adjectives: opinion - size - shape - color - origin - material - purpose <br><br>  At the initial stage, this should be enough to start ‚Äúthinking‚Äù to some degree in English, and not just about him. <br><br>  My advice, learn to ask questions first: in everyday communication, we usually ask and answer questions.  Make yourself a challenge, write at least 10/20/30 ... (depending on your time and desire) questions for each time, questions with modal verbs, on any topics (10 questions in a restaurant, pharmacy, gas station, when renting a car, personal questions Yes, anything.  My beginners usually write 100 questions a week.  Work out the questions.  Bring to automatism.  Ask yourself (can be on a voice recorder), ask friends, etc.  Do you want to ask here in the comments, I will rule as much as possible. <br>  Thus, when in real life you come across a question, you will understand it, which means it will be clear how to answer it.  And to answer the question (in terms of grammar) is easier than asking it, because we have 6 magic rule: <br><br>  6. What is in the question is also in the answer (of course, there are a small number of exceptions, but it sounds nice). <br><br>  I will consider further how to ‚Äústart‚Äù further (for advanced ones, it may be completely uninteresting). <br><br>  Personal pronouns.  Let's remember, in the English 2 case: the nominative (remember that this is the subject, yes?) And the other (we will call it ‚Äúobject‚Äù, in fact, this is all the other cases except the nominative). <br>  I-me <br>  You-you <br>  He - him <br>  She - her <br>  It - it <br>  We - us <br>  You - you <br>  They - them <br><br>  About these pronouns you need to know the following: the sentence begins with the subject, <b>after</b> it comes the verb: I see, I can, I am and so on. <br>  In this case, the verb will always go <b>before the object</b> : I see you.  He sees me.  I like it.  She likes us. <br>  Subject - Verb - Object <br>  About you: the easiest way to remember is that in English you are a plural, which means ‚Äúyou‚Äù.  Therefore, the verb after will always be in the plural form. <br>  Possessive pronouns come in 2 types: the one after which there is a noun and the one after which it does not exist. <br>  - What is it? <br>  - It's my book. <br>  - Whose is this? <br>  - Mine. <br>  Type 1 (there is a noun after it) <br>  Type 2 (there is no noun after it) <br>  My-mine <br>  Your-Yours <br>  His-his <br>  Her-hers <br>  Its- (do not say so) <br>  Our-Ours <br>  Your-Yours <br>  Their-theirs <br>  There are still demonstrative pronouns. <br>  This - these <br>  That - those <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0d/mb/1s/0dmb1sk7_4pafv0gl04j_-4ouxq.jpeg"><br>  The principle of use as in Russian. <br><br>  Next we need to be. <br>  Be - to be, to be, to be, to be. <br>  Everything that we use after this verb directly depends on its translation: <br>  To be, to be, to be - what, who, what, where, when, where. <br>  To be - where, when. <br>  Those.  after be there are adjectives, nouns, circumstances of the place and time. <br>  Be has personal forms in the present (past) time that are tied to the actor: am (was), is (was), are (were). <br>  Am is used only with I. <br>  Is with the only number of 3 persons (ie, he, she, it). <br>  Are - with the plural. <br>  Very often (even very, very) be can not be translated into Russian (it‚Äôs in Russian, not English): I‚Äôm at home.  I am hardworking.  Why is tea cold? <br>  Sometimes in Russian this is another verb: for example, ‚ÄúWhy are you late?‚Äù And in English, Why are you late?  Because late is an adjective, and with adjectives we use be. <br>  It is with the help of be that we find out where something is located: Where is the theater / exit / entrance / bathroom? <br>  And with the help of him, we also express dissatisfaction with the current situation: Why is it so cold / hot?  Why are you angry / sad?  Why is it so expensive?  Why are you late? <br>  There are a couple of topics that relate exclusively to be, but about them later. <br><br>  To begin with, we still need to add adjectives to this set.  Everything is simple with them: they have only 3 types (degrees: ordinary, comparative, excellent) and only less than 10 exceptions.  Collect your adjectives collection. <br><br>  And then, those who still want to start, you have to be patient and make sentences: statements / questions / negations with pronouns, adjectives and be.  My favorite rule in this regard: the more the better. <br>  But as?  Better and in writing, and orally (voice recorder).  Speaking what you write is very useful: you train speaking, the brain perceives by ear (drive into the translator, it will be voiced to you too), it is easier to remember and settles somewhere on the surface, and not in the depths. <br>  How to understand that the sentence is wrong?  Put the numbers above the words: 1 - subject, 2 - predicate;  in question 0, 1, 2, 3 (see the nameplate).  By the way, you can check yourself with a search engine (but not a translator), and see what happens, look for the whole offer.  If you are just starting, start with short sentences. <br><br>  Of course, if everything is clear, add nouns (I advise you to take by subject groups).  For example, you have learned all the words from the topic "family".  Now go back to possessive pronouns, ask questions with adjectives about family members, describe them (at first it is better to take only adjectives + be): Is your dad tall?  Then take the topic of "food", for example: Is this cake delicious?  And there are 100 such questions on each topic. <br><br>  Many wrote in the comments to my previous post about the winning words.  Learning words is a necessity, it is important, but not the word itself is more important, but the possibilities of using it in speech, in different situations.  Did you learn 100 words in a day?  Cool!  Now write the text out of them.  Learned 100 adjectives / verbs?  Fine!  Now ask each with 1-2 questions (of course, both in writing and orally). <br><br>  Write in the comments questions, suggestions, what else to make out.  Soon I will write about the times (of course, their analysis is complete on the Internet, but it may be someone who interprets my interpretation). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/417665/">https://habr.com/ru/post/417665/</a></p>
