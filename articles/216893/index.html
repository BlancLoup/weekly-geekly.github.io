This year, it turned out to be really the largest in the Urals - we managed to gather on the same site a little more than 900 developers, designers, analysts, testers, layout designers and people involved in the science of IT.  Participants gathered from 19 cities of Russia and the world. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4f3/ea2/c9b/4f3ea2c9bcdbfc308c1e46c1c8c51531.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  Conference format </h5><br>  Reports were read in 6 parallel threads and 8 sections: Fronttalks, Serverside, Development Management, Interface Design, Mobile, Analytics, Testing, Rocket science.  In addition, a round table on the theme ‚ÄúBusiness in IT‚Äù was held.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The gigantic work in the preparation of sections was played by program directors who selected reports, organized preliminary runs (interestingly, the speakers of the Testing section had the most predictors), you can immediately see the real testers, write useful posts on Habr (for example, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/it_people/blog/215017/">here</a> about Serverside, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/it_people/blog/214767/">here</a> about analytics and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/it_people/blog/214857/">here</a> about testing), in general, did everything to make the conference really interesting.

It was possible to understand whether your project should automate the testing of typesetting from the report of <b>Tatiana Cheremnykh</b> (Naumen).  <b>Mikhail Mikryukov</b> made a report on the implementation of testing in the online store E96. <br><br><h5>  Rocket science section </h5><br>  <b>Alexey Zinoviev</b> (Tamtek) made a report about the tools and methods of processing and storing large graphs, and <b>Andrei Gein</b> (SKB Kontur) shared his experience on what they did with large graphs.  <b>Ksenia Zhagorina</b> (SKB Kontur) explained how unique the name of a person is and how you can use this uniqueness.  <b>Oleg Yevsegneev</b> (Naumen) showed 3D-printers and told whether it is possible to print on it, for example, belyash.  <b>Mikhail Korobov</b> (Scrapinghub.com), <b>Anton Firsov</b> (Knoema), <b>Alexander Patrakov</b> (SkyDNS), <b>Evgeny Makarov</b> (Aydeko) also reported on science. <br><br>  We repent, more participants registered than originally planned, so on the last day we had to drastically change the rooms, which made it difficult to find this section, and the photographer, unfortunately, never reached this room. <br><br>  Read more about what was discussed this year can be on the <a href="http://dump-it.ru/">link</a> .  It‚Äôs almost impossible to describe about 70 reports in one post, so wait for the video (they will appear a bit later on the site). <br><br><h5>  In the breaks, or "Did you stroke the cat?" </h5><br>  In the intervals between the reports, the participants enjoyed themselves as much as they could: it was possible to gather a giant junga, sit in a soft area with cats, drive on speed on an electric bike, win a certificate for 3D printing themselves, compete in programming tasks, play console, eat porridge, pancakes, ice cream or just talk, the benefit of the place was a lot.  After the report, the participants ate a huge cake from SKB Kontur. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b94/dfd/365/b94dfd365cf5922115502e04c477c5f2.jpg" alt="image"><h6>  Megajenga </h6><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8af/d4a/524/8afd4a524a52a5dee9ec23540622b179.jpg" alt="image"><h6>  @igorlukanin <br>  Did you stroke the cat?  ‚ÄúAt the developer conference, even cats are introverts,‚Äù they say in #dump </h6><br><br><h5>  Afterparty </h5><br>  This year, we decided to have an after-party in the same place as the conference itself.  After the reports, the developers sat down in the Expo hall: the poker table was located in one corner, the mafia was played in another, and the third was a game store with a bunch of board games.  The bartenders from the sponsors staged a real show with burning bottles and juggling and made cocktails all evening. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bfb/359/316/bfb359316e30f0343a6e17f5612eaf3e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  An interesting observation: on the party, one of the sponsors invited dancers who danced Latin dances during the evening.  This caused a controversial reaction of the participants, and a whole holivar on the topic ‚ÄúDo half-naked girls at an IT conference?‚Äù Erupted on Twitter (can be found on the hashtag #dump). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/405/a15/0d1/405a150d1d3be09492173c75c69d0d05.jpg" alt="image"><br><h6>  @rdvornov <br>  First of all, first of all planes ... # DAMP </h6><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8e7/20d/7ae/8e720d7aedc32209e3910bf9ea249003.jpg" alt="image"><h6>  Lounge area </h6><br><br><h5>  Some reviews about the conference </h5><br>  @ Ultramarin7 <br>  Went to #dump.

See you next year :) <br><br>  I am very pleased that 70% of the participants in the feedback questionnaires wrote that they left the conference with at least one idea that they plan to implement in the near future. <br><br>  Photos from the conference can be viewed <a href="http://vk.com/it_people%3Fw%3Dwall-19617695_580">here</a> , <a href="https://www.facebook.com/it.people/photos_albums">here</a> and <a href="http://fotki.yandex.ru/users/it-people-ekb/album/417302/">here</a> .  Special thanks for the <a href="http://fotki.yandex.ru/users/davydov-mikhail/album/413520/%3Fp%3D5">photos of</a> Michael Davydov. <br><br>  Thanks to our sponsors who made the conference possible: SKB Kontur, Naumen, ITM Holding, Extreme Pro, Abak-Press, Exadel, Aydeko, NetAngels. <br><br>  Next year will be the anniversary fifth DUMP.  We are planning to assemble 1,200 IT specialists, bring more foreign speakers and reassemble the cool crowd.  After all, at the IT conference, in addition to reports, it is important to meet people who love their work and are ready to talk about it with joy.  By the way, on June 2 and 3, we will organize the second <a href="http://pycon.ru/2014/">PyCon Russia</a> - we promise that the reports will be on top, and people will gather great! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/216893/">https://habr.com/ru/post/216893/</a></p>
