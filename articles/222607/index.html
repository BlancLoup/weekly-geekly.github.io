It is a celebration of all those who have chosen restless freedom and independence in the difficult task of earning their daily bread.  This is a celebration of free shooters, labor book ronin.  Today is the day of the freelancer! <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  For our country, the phenomenon of freelance if not new, it is certainly still unusual and somewhat alien.  Although everything is new - well forgotten old.  In Russia, there has long been a stratum of people, as they would say today, who are not in the staff of any organization.  Instead, they were hired for various temporary, piece-work.  Of course, not all of these workers chose this way of life of their own free will, in part this was dictated by unemployment.  Nevertheless, freelancers have existed in our country for a long time, and they used to be called ‚Äúfreelance‚Äù, which was almost forgotten today.

      But despite this, more and more people in our country and around the world are becoming freelancers.  Advances in telecommunications technology have made freelance possible and accessible to millions of people on the planet.  And this process is welcome.  After all, in order to earn and be successful, freelancers must constantly keep up with their profession in time, that is, they must constantly improve their skills and learn the latest trends.  That is, being a freelancer means a priori being a good specialist and being able to sell yourself. <br><br>  Of course, not every profession can become a freelancer.  Most of all to this the spheres of design and IT.  And it is not by chance that there are many more people with higher education among freelancers than the national average: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d33/368/a5e/d33368a5ebc833a970040d1374bc9082.jpg"><br><br>  There is an opinion that every office worker deeply in his heart dreams of becoming a freelancer.  Alas, the corporate culture in many companies does not allow employees to feel free, to be in psychological comfort.  Freelancers, on the other hand, do not experience the similar effects of the surrounding office space.  However, among the companies there are quite a few other examples when among the employees only the ‚Äúfreelance spirit‚Äù is encouraged - looseness, creative approach to work, calm benevolence.  Add to this the stability of earnings, the opportunity to work on much larger projects, getting rich experience of cooperation with high-level specialists and social packages - and it turns out that being a freelancer is not always better. <br><br>  Of course, not every person will dare to embark on such an independent "swimming", even with the right skills and knowledge.  A successful freelancer is not only a good specialist, but first and foremost a brave, persistent and responsible person.  Professionalism and efficiency are their motto.  As the saying goes, love girls simple freelancers! <br><br>  Happy holiday, friends! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/222607/">https://habr.com/ru/post/222607/</a></p>
