Reasonable / Vedomosti</i> <br><br>  The new draft law ‚ÄúOn the autonomous system of the Internet‚Äù implies the introduction of a whole complex of amendments to the laws ‚ÄúOn Communications‚Äù and ‚ÄúOn Information ..‚Äù, <a href="http://www.vedomosti.ru/technology/articles/2016/05/27/642739-chinovniki-hotyat-internetom">write</a> ‚ÄúVedomosti‚Äù.  This document assumes full state control over the runet infrastructure.  The draft law is only at the initial stage of development, it has not yet been discussed with the RF Minister of Communications Nikolai Nikiforov. <br><br>  The document states the need to regulate the infrastructure of the Russian segment of the Internet.  This term means a set of lines and communication centers located in Russia, as well as data centers that are responsible for the operation of the RuNet.  There is a new concept in the document ‚Äúautonomous system‚Äù.  The authors of the bill explain the term as ‚Äúcommunications and other technical means with a unique number, the traffic passing between them is carried out according to the same rules‚Äù. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The draft law provides for the introduction of a new clause in the legislation - ‚ÄúRegulation of the Russian part of the Internet‚Äù.  We are talking about the regulation of the main elements of the infrastructure, including the national .ru domains of the Russian Federation, traffic exchange points, the state system for ensuring the sustainability of the network, ‚Äúthe infrastructure of the autonomous systems of Russian natural and legal persons‚Äù (all communication networks of the country).  An autonomous system can be considered the own network of any company, both telecom operators and other organizations.  The owners of any network (autonomous system "that" interacts with the autonomous system of a foreign state "will have to install technical means of controlling the cross-border schedule.

      In the case of the adoption of the bill, the prerogative of managing Runet will belong to the state.  Management functions will be performed by the federal executive authority in accordance with the law ‚ÄúOn the contract system in the field of procurement of goods, works, services for state and municipal needs‚Äù. <br><br>  In addition, in Russia, according to the document, a single federal information system will be created to ensure the integrity and sustainability of the RuNet.  Such a system will include routing and addressing information systems, traffic monitoring, and a system of root domain names.  In other words, in this case, a completely autonomous system of functioning of the RuNet will be created.  If necessary, the runet can work autonomously, outside the global network.  So far it is not about creating a traffic filtering system like the Chinese one.  But autonomy is a safety issue, since too much traffic goes through external points. <br><br>  The draft law provides for the establishment of control over all autonomous systems of the network, indifferently, they were created by individuals, legal entities or individual entrepreneurs.  And all users of such systems will be required to submit information about themselves to the state for posting data in the state information system. <br><br>  Another interesting point is the proposal to create information systems by using domestic encryption algorithms and a national root certification authority.  Earlier, Alexander Zharov, head of Roskomnadzor, spoke about the problem of encrypting a significant proportion of the runet traffic, which is bad in terms of countering extremism and terrorism. <br><br>  Earlier, the Ministry of Communications and Mass Media reported <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/275752/">plans to achieve</a> a 99% <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/275752/">indicator</a> on the transmission of Russian Internet traffic within the country.  In 2014, this figure was 70%.  In addition, it is planned to duplicate 99% of the critical network infrastructure.  In 2014, the percentage of duplicated infrastructure was 0%, in 2016 this figure should increase to 40%. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/356454/">https://habr.com/ru/post/356454/</a></p>
