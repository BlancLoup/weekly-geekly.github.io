And there was one game that was wonderful, and very funny, and it was called ‚ÄúPantomime‚Äù somewhere, and the advanced guys called ‚ÄúCrocodile‚Äù.  Where these wonderful names come from - we do not know, and it is not about that. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="http://img143.imageshack.us/img143/9939/78340030.png" alt="Drawing interface"><br><br><blockquote>  The essence of the game was that the players were divided into two teams.  One of the teams (guessing) confers and suggests a word or phrase.  Then, from the opposite command (guessing one), a "victim" is selected, which is strictly confidential with the "cherished word".  The task of the "victim" silently and without using objects, (or in the figure) is to show your team what was conceived.  The team, respectively, must guess.  The tour lasts until complete guessing or the guessing team surrenders.  After that, the teams change places.  The guessing team is not forbidden to make humorous sentences on what the "victim" shows. </blockquote>

    <h4>  Nowadays </h4><br>  But as time passed, more people began to sit at the computer and communicate on the Internet.  Yes, go to the site " <a href="http://www.cheloveche.ru/">Man</a> " for these purposes.  And on the site that lived developers fun.  Let people think they amuse them for the joy of their own traffic.  And they conceived a game to think up, but not such that one person was sitting, and an evil computer was hopping.  This they already had, " <a href="http://www.cheloveche.ru/paintball">Paintball 2.0</a> " clicked.  And the most that neither gangstand.  And they remembered about the forgotten fun. <br><br><img src="http://img43.imageshack.us/img43/9675/73025251.png" alt="Game creation"><br><br>  But they decided not to divide people into the teams, but to assign the role of the enemy of the villain to the iron computer.  So that he would guess the word and choose a fierce ‚Äúvictim‚Äù, to draw which, the word that was thought, the turn came. <br>  No sooner said than done.  And after thinking for a week, having studied all the technologies and used them, they assembled a digital prototype in 2 weeks.  Yes, and gave people for fun. <br><br><img src="http://img178.imageshack.us/img178/580/91106133.png" alt="Guessing interface with hint"><br><br>  But before they gave, they began to think how to name their child, so that the name is resounding, but for old people it is clear that they were playing the old game.  They invented for a long time, but they didn‚Äôt enter the bright little heads, and then the developer‚Äôs governor said that the old, forgotten name, Crocodile, would be called, and there was one buffoon with a clown face, and he decided to tease the governor he asked mockingly KrokHOT?  And in that moment, there was a vision for all, that is the true name. <br><br>  People played in the prototype one, but they found small bugs, but they sent various desires to the developers that we want to play in private, and send a link to the created game to send to friends.  And the developers listened to them and heeded their wishes. <br><br><img src="http://img185.imageshack.us/img185/8072/90563089.png" alt="Waiting interface"><br><br>  Here you are, my dear reader, <a href="http://www.cheloveche.ru/paintomimes">I want to invite you to marvel at the amazing thing that is marvelous</a> .  Yes, get a little pleasure, myself and people amused.  And questions which will be, or angry wishes, do not be shy, write in the comments, we will try to answer all. <br><br><img src="http://img401.imageshack.us/img401/5702/14603152.png" alt="Game results"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/69131/">https://habr.com/ru/post/69131/</a></p>
