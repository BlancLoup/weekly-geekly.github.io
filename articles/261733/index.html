After saving the HTML page with the whole environment (pictures, styles, etc), I packed it into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_(file_format)">ZIP archive</a> and sent it to the addressee.  Within five minutes I received feedback, which, contrary to my expectations, was connected not with the article itself, but with the fact that the archive was absolutely empty.  After scratching my head and deciding that I was blunted with archiving, I repeated the procedure, making sure to select all the files needed for packing.  A few minutes later, an acquaintance again broke out surprised, ‚ÄúAre you kidding me?‚Äù While I was not joking at all. <br><br>  I started to put together all the elements of the puzzle.  First, I found out what he is trying to open the archive.  Suddenly, as a viewer, he uses some kind of third-rate garbage. Don't get it from which developer?  However, it turned out to be the default <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Explorer">explorer.exe</a> .  I used <a href="http://www.ghisler.com/">Total Commander</a> both for packing and for viewing the resulting archive, and in my case it was not at all empty:

I tried to open the same archive on my computer with the help of explorer.exe and finally believed my friend - the archive really looked empty: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/359/c2d/8ec/359c2d8ec209e21b1bba35fcf17f59f8.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Who is to blame for this behavior?  Let's figure it out. <br><br>  How was the process, and what came of it, read under the cut (carefully, a <b>lot of screenshots</b> ).  Before reading this article, I also <b>strongly</b> recommend that you review the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/nikitatrophimov/topics/">previous ones</a> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Experimentally, I found that the problem is reproduced, at a minimum, if there is a '' 'in the name of the archived file (for example, "" some_file.txt ").  Next, I found out that when using <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/">7-Zip</a> as an archiver, the contents of the resulting archive are quietly displayed in explorer.exe.  Checking the ‚Äúproblematic‚Äù archive for errors with the built-in tools of 7-Zip also revealed nothing: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c53/08a/480/c5308a480ca1a9b9cd5e509ea953abcb.png" alt="image"><br><br>  By the way, did you notice that instead of the characters' '' and '"' in the original archive, Total Commander shows the underscore character ('_')?  7-Zip File Manager, in turn, replaced '' 'with the' &lt;'character: <br><br><img src="https://hsto.org/files/eb1/013/07d/eb101307d1134b7b8db654eea1fc17f9.PNG" alt="image"><br><br>  What is it?  Let's not guess and see how ZIP-archives differ in the case when one was packed with Total Commander's built-in archiver, and the second with 7-Zip. <br><br>  To begin with, we create a minimal example that reproduces the problem situation - I stopped at the empty file ‚Äú‚Äú some_file.txt ‚Äù(the final archive will be called‚Äú ‚Äúsome_file.zip‚Äù).  Next, we archive it in both ways without compression and take <a href="http://www.chmaas.handshake.de/delphi/freeware/xvi32/xvi32.htm">XVI32</a> in our hands, in which we open both the resulting archives: <br><br>  <b>Problem archive</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/55d/787/580/55d787580ff86178565881a7d20b7e5b.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Normal archive</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/305/b5f/f22/305b5ff228211ce95c68ba820472f37d.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Already with the naked eye it is noticeable that their contents are different from each other.  However, this should not yet cause any specific emotions, because archivers can easily write information about themselves loved ones in some "additional" fields.  To make sure what exactly the difference between these files is, let's look at the <a href="https://pkware.cachefly.net/webdocs/casestudies/APPNOTE.TXT">specification</a> and the <a href="https://users.cs.jmu.edu/buchhofp/forensics/formats/pkzip.html">third-party description of</a> the ZIP format and ‚Äúsplit‚Äù our bytes into its component parts: <br><br>  <b>Problem archive</b> <br><pre> Local file header

</pre><br><br>  As you can see, in the case of a problem archive, the ‚Äú¬´ ‚Äùsymbol really‚Äú turned ‚Äùinto '&lt;' (0x3C) for some reason, while in the normal archive it continues to be itself (0xC2 0xAB - this is how it <a href="http://unicode-table.com/ru/00AB/">is represented</a> in UTF -eight). <br><br>  And what will happen if we simply replace '&lt;' in the problematic archive with '' ', of course, simultaneously changing the values ‚Äã‚Äãof the remaining bytes, which we could influence in this way?  Replace 0x3C with 0xC2 0xAB (note that you need to do this in two places at once), 0x0E 0x00 (File name len) with 0x0F 0x00 (this also needs to be done in two places), 0x3C 0x00 0x00 0x00 (Central directory size) with 0x3D 0x00 0x00 0x00 (since we have increased the size of the Central directory with our previous actions) and 0x2C 0x00 0x00 0x00 (Offset of cd wrt to strating disk) by 0x2D 0x00 0x00 0x00.  The result should be the following: <br><br><img src="https://hsto.org/files/ea2/e52/e32/ea2e52e3213d49a2afada401eafd2015.PNG" alt="image"><br><br>  Open the resulting archive in explorer.exe and see: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/073/c6f/4c4/073c6f4c4671acf5f42a88d0c8e4659f.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Yes, the file is now visible, but there is clearly something wrong with its name.  We scour the specification in search of the word "unicode" and meet the following: <br><br><blockquote>  APPENDIX D - Language Encoding (EFS) <br><br>  D.1 The ZIP format historically supported only the original IBM PC character <br>  encoding set, commonly referred to as IBM Code Page 437. This limits storing <br>  MS-DOS range of values <br>  and not support file names in other character encodings, or <br>  languages.  To address this limitation, this specification will support the <br>  following change. <br><br>  D.2 If you need to use the file name 11 <br>  to the original ZIP character encoding.  If general purpose bit 11 is set, the <br>  The Unicode Standard, Version 4.1.0 or <br>  UTF-8 storage <br>  specification.  The Unicode Standard is published by the The Unicode. <br>  Consortium (www.unicode.org).  UTF-8 encoded data stored within ZIP files <br>  byte order mark (BOM) </blockquote><br>  Let's see if 11 bits of the flag field are set in our cases: <br><br>  <b>Problem archive</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/600/53a/ae8/60053aae863d1a1aba1f127c76a904b8.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Normal archive</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/404/dac/51e/404dac51e014b9a3ac9fbccb43923a91.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Let's set this flag in case of a problem file (Tools -&gt; Bit manipulation) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/176/9fc/b33/1769fcb33fc713877b37de1419172a32.png" alt="image"><br><br>  and try again to open our archive in explorer.exe: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/073/c6f/4c4/073c6f4c4671acf5f42a88d0c8e4659f.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Similarly, we forgot that the flag fields are actually two: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a3/e3b/716/3a3e3b71659b15407baa4a194f438dd6.png" alt="image"><br><br>  We set the required bit in this field and re-open our archive: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/594/1a2/e73/5941a2e736e13d4a335feeff76a991b1.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Great!  That's just why Total Commander "turns" the symbol "" into "&lt;"?  In order to understand this, take <a href="http://www.ollydbg.de/">OllyDbg</a> in hand and launch the file manager we are researching in it.  But wait, let's check if <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_space_layout_randomization">ASLR</a> technology is enabled for totalcmd.exe.  We load it into PE Tools with Alt-1, click on the ‚ÄúOptional Header‚Äù button and see that the base will not change (for a more detailed description of this process I recommend to look at the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/261507/">previous article</a> ): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/093/db2/d47/093db2d47726c0663d40def10110139a.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Obviously, to create a TC archive at the beginning, you should use the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa363858(v%3Dvs.85).aspx">CreateFile</a> WinAPI function, so we will set breakpoints on its calls (most likely, in our case, it should use the Unicode version of this function): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/723/928/100/723928100728d207a7ca924f5ae1bd70.png" alt="image"><br><br>  We remove the breakpoints that are triggered for every action we do not need (for example, at the event of receiving the focus window TC at <b>0x00567264</b> ): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e8e/218/6dc/e8e2186dc54b76769bb9bb96126e8a95.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Press Alt-F5 (key combination for archiving files in Total Commander), click on ‚ÄúOK‚Äù and find ourselves here: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/732/6a0/5dd/7326a05ddd6a11d4097db143f0653bdd.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Let's try to understand whether TC has already converted the character '' 'to' &lt;'.  To do this, open the "Memory" window with Alt-M -&gt; left-click on the first line -&gt; Ctrl-B -&gt; enter "&lt;some_file.txt" in the "ASCII" field: <br><br><img src="https://hsto.org/files/205/e2b/d89/205e2bd89b69449895ffcc9cdf737d54.PNG" alt="image"><br><br>  Click on the ‚ÄúOK‚Äù button and see that already at the moment the application has implemented its transformation: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fd3/9e9/4a5/fd39e94a5216401bfc71fe5657014432.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Press Alt-K to look at the Call Stack: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a4a/7ac/61e/a4a7ac61eed769dc419926bd1e7f2d1e.png" alt="image"><br><br>  We set breakpoints at the beginning of each of the procedures in the list, press F9, delete the resulting archive, and make sure that the string "&lt;some_file.txt" is no longer in the process memory.  After this, we start the archiving process again and stop at the beginning of the first procedure from the Call Stack shown earlier: <br><br><img src="https://hsto.org/files/c98/fc6/d90/c98fc6d90d0a49d8987def9435ee60b3.PNG" alt="image"><br><br>  Again we are looking for the same line in the whole memory of the process and ... We find it: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a92/005/18c/a9200518cd70dec1f715edd40dff946a.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Well, the last logical option at the moment is to put a breakpoint at the beginning of the last procedure in the Call Stack, from which, in fact, they called us here: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/041/c87/567/041c87567b389a29b0cbb1184b957d87.png" alt="image"><br><br>  We jump to the call (right-click on the line with the address of the current procedure in the Call Stack window -&gt; Show Call), run up to the start of the procedure indicated by OllyDbg and set a bryak on it: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4ca/5b2/6db/4ca5b26db4cf73b5a568123b1fe936e5.png" alt="image"><br><br>  We perform the same actions as before (hard press F9, delete the archive, check the process memory for the absence of the string "&lt;some_file.txt", press Alt-F5 and the "OK" button) and stop at the just-delivered breakpoint.

Looking closely at what is happening inside it, we can detect the call to the WinAPI function <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms647473(v%3Dvs.85).aspx">CharToOem</a> : <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d0e/fb7/1b4/d0efb71b414de70036551a07116cc55a.png" alt="image"><br><br>  According to official documentation, this function translates the transferred string into an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_page">OEM-defined character set</a> , and, if an ANSI version is used, we can perform a so-called  "In place translation" (src and dest can point to the same address, which eliminates the need to create a separate buffer for the destination string), which happens in the case of TC: <br><br><blockquote>  lpszDst [out] <br>  Type: LPSTR <br>  The destination buffer, which receives the string string.  If you want to use the ANSI function, you can see the same address as the lpszSrc parameter.  This cannot be done if CharToOem is being used as a wide-character function </blockquote><br>  Yes, after its call, the buffer transferred to it already actually contains the character '&lt;' instead of '' ': <br><br><img src="https://hsto.org/files/119/cdd/2b4/119cdd2b4f104777b8bf87b1585ffa5c.PNG" alt="image"><br><br>  What will we patch?  Let's first take a look at the archiving options in TC: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a43/9fa/d4a/a439fad4abe6460f9314ac9ab5ceb07a.png" alt="image"><br><br>  By default, the ‚ÄúPack Unicode names‚Äù option is set to ‚ÄúAsk every time a Unicode name is encountered‚Äù.  Consequently, TC did not consider that the name encountered was Unicode.  And if you try to archive a file, for example, with Chinese characters? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/166/4a4/f37/1664a4f3753df4fa048f9da0989df3c6.png" alt="image"><br><br>  As you can see, in this case, TC displays a window with a message about the encountered file name, which contains characters other than the code page used.  In the case of the ‚Äú‚Äù symbol, there wasn‚Äôt such a message, most likely because many code pages and (in my case, apparently, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows-1251">CP1251</a> ) contain this symbol in the additional ‚Äúcells‚Äù assigned to them.  But if you set this option in ‚ÄúAll as UTF-8 if at least one contains characters&gt; 127‚Äù, then we will see that our ‚Äúsome_file.txt‚Äù file is correctly packed and subsequently displayed in explorer.exe. <br><br>  You can ask ‚ÄúWhy, even if the file name changed from‚Äû ‚Äúsome_file.txt‚Äú to ‚Äû&lt;some_file.txt‚Äú, explorer.exe could not display it with at least the changed name ‚Äù?  The fact is that '&lt;' is one of the characters that are <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa365247(v%3Dvs.85).aspx">prohibited</a> for use in the names of directories and files in the case of NTFS: <br><br><blockquote>  The following reserved characters: <br><br>  &lt;(less than) <br>  &gt; (greater than) <br>  : (colon) <br>  "(double quote) <br>  / (forward slash) <br>  \ (backslash) <br>  |  (vertical bar or pipe) <br>  ?  (question mark) <br>  * (asterisk) </blockquote><br>  Moreover, unzipping such an archive using the built-in Windows tools also fails.  Firstly, because of the symbol ‚Äú‚Äú ‚Äùin the name of the archive itself: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e7c/3ca/9c2/e7c3ca9c297c4121212e4a145c9d02f0.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Secondly, because of its content: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a3d/a7c/f92/a3da7cf92aa5977e1d5565822dd3360c.png" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Afterword </h3><br>  In absolutely any product there are bugs / features (call it what you want) that can crawl out in the most unexpected places, and the more complex the software complex is, the more bugs it can usually be detected.  Do not be lazy to study the reasons for the behavior that has arisen to you, because it is quite possible that in the process of researching an application you will learn something new. <br><br>  Thank you for your attention, and again I hope that the article was useful to someone. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/261733/">https://habr.com/ru/post/261733/</a></p>
