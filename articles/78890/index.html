  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Do not let the process problems sink</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The fact that the problems of the process must be given maximum attention has been known long ago. <br>  Unfortunately, life is rather harsh and very often we are faced with a situation where there is simply not enough time to find a way out of the current situation within the framework of the correct process.  It is necessary to cut here and now, because  time does not wait. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  Recently, I began to notice that many people are not able to keep in their head a balance between solving a problem here and now and solving it in the overall process.  Those.  sometimes in conversations people say either or, which is fundamentally wrong.  Yes, sometimes you can give in to the higher forces and plug the problem here and now, but the main thing in such a situation is to achieve a solution and a systemic consideration of this situation.  Without this, the performer, who by his <s>kindness of spiritual</s> stupidity agreed to plug the problem with his hands, runs the risk of becoming a regular hole-raiser.  If you are trying to persuade you to do this, always keep in mind that with a forgetful guide, it can turn into a system.  Do you need it? <br>  Therefore, the main thing is to bring the solution of the problem in the overall process to its logical conclusion.  And it is necessary first of all to the performer, since  otherwise, he will be appointed as an extreme one.  It is necessary either to make time for solving the problem, or to obtain as much as possible formal confirmation from the management that this problem is realized and that higher areas will work with its risk.  And until it is resolved, it is also formal to register regular over-heads in working time to solve this problem.  As experience shows, the presence of a regular overhead projector introduces many managers in an unsympathetic state and they are trying to remove it somewhere.  But here they keep themselves, because  until there is no solution to the problem, the risk remains and you will not remove this overhead projector. <br>  <s>I hate</s> wildly dislike people who do not understand this logic.  What if they agree to be a gag, they actually lay a time bomb into the overall process.  At the same time, these individuals have a habit of blaming the catastrophe afterwards on their manager, since  Like I told him, but he did not pay attention.  The egocentrism of this position is terrible.  First of all, you still need to understand that a normal manager, a sane person and being familiar with the facts will make an effort to solve the problem.  The situation of an irresponsible manager does not take, because  they must immediately be dismissed, because  in Russia, IT does not pay enough to endure an idiot manager.  It is important to convey the criticality of the problem.  Yes, perhaps through a hard conversation or a letter, but nevertheless necessary.  Because  once coming up and saying a whimper, you did not convey the significance of the problem.  You do not need to be an egocentric who thinks that your every word is heard.  First you will regret yourself later, secondly it is simply wrong.  Here, of course, there may be another extreme when a person begins to make an elephant out of a fly and to make trouble for any reason, but this is already a matter for you.  We must still be able to correctly see the problems in their own area of ‚Äã‚Äãresponsibility.  If this condition is not met, then all of the above does not make sense. <br><br>  Total. <br>  When we talk about the process, the logic of the weak link works well as never before.  If you did not tell about the problem or did not recognize it, then you are the weak link.  If the manager has gone into denial and does not want to take action to resolve the situation, then he is a weak link and it is important that he be a formally responsible person in such a situation.  If higher spheres do not want to give time to risk, then they are a weak link.  It is imperative that the person on whom the decision stopped was formally responsible for the possible consequences.  The person understands that they will have him in case of something and begins to strain strongly in order to either solve the problem or disclaim responsibility.  In principle, it is not very important what he will do, because  the main thing is that the punishment for failure was inevitable.  If he finds an idiot who agrees to take responsibility without the possibility of a decision, then it means he will fly in and maybe he will understand that this is not necessary.  Or the idiot will be fired at all, but the company will not suffer from this either.  Responsibility will be returned to someone else and the fate of the dismissed person will strongly encourage him. <br>  In general, bring the problem to the final solution and you will be happy. </div>
