  <section class="page js-page"><h1>3 days of operation cyanogenmod 10.2 on a Samsung Galaxy Note N7000 or how I traded a green robot for blue</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I am 20 years old, studying and working in St. Petersburg.  I do not know how to program at the proper level, develop and assemble controllers or hack anything, but I really want to learn.  Communication with the PC is quite close, but it didn‚Äôt go further than reinstalling the OS or building a new unit from scratch. <br><br>  As it becomes clear, I also use my Korean phablet mainly as a phone and, from time to time, as a game console.  The device is no different, it is already a good 3 years and it greatly affects the performance of the OS: there were jams, podtarmazhivaniya, hang, reboot - all like most owners of devices on Android older than 1.5 years. <br><br>  Following the trends of the Internet in admiration of OnePlus One, I came across a cyanogemod wasp and was surprised to find the opportunity to install it in almost everything that has a screen and a USB connector.  The search for installation instructions led me to a site that is quite well-known among Android fans and smart apple owners, where such instructions are a dime a dozen.  Since I didn‚Äôt touch the phone for good, I didn‚Äôt reach further the opening of the menu for developers, most of these instructions seemed to me impracticable.  Searching from this pile of text for the most simple and understandable, in my opinion, as an experiment, I tried to perform the first point - to run the recovery, as far as I understood.  This idea failed miserably and the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãinstalling cyanogenmod was postponed until better times and more direct hands. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Not long ago, I came across an article on fundraising at cyanogenmod installator and launching it in google play.  Examination of the store did not give results.  A google search led me to the English-language website <a href="http://get.cm/">get.cm</a> , which contained a brief instruction from 5 points on installing cyanogenmod on an Android device using a PC, a cord and, in fact, an experimental phone.  Quickly searching for more information about this program and making sure that the installation on my phablet is possible, I proceeded to the action, quite spontaneously (in the process I buried all the data on the device 30 times). 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      After completing the instructions, the installation began.  Then my adventures began: during the process they called me on this phone, the conversation turned out to be tense on my part, and the unsuspecting on the other.  After the end of the conversation, to my horror, the installation did not continue: the phone hung with the download sign, and the PC lost it and refused to find it again.  After 10 minutes of seance, in order to establish a connection, I accepted the transformation of the Korean phablet into building material and decided to take a desperate step: remove the battery from the phablet and restart the PC. <br><br>  Phablet came to life with stock firmware on board.  Joy knew no bounds, but the feeling of incompleteness gave no peace.  I repeated the operation on both devices: on the phablet and on the PC.  Surprise was the continuation of the installation from the same place and its soon ending.  When I started the machine, I drew a blue robot's head with a rotating arrow around it, a strange sight lasted about 3-4 minutes, after that the first launch took place.  I was surprised at the suggestion to enter a Google account after creating a cyanogenmod account, this was not what I expected, and the hope of resurrecting data on the phone resounded like a phoenix from the ashes (wherever I read about cyanogenmod, I wrote about the absence of Google applications and programs and the need to install them myself). <br><br>  The device started completely naked: without any previously installed programs or widgets.  However, a complete list of contacts was found in the notebook, and all the accumulated photos and videos were in the gallery.  During the survey of information about the phone found cyanogenmod 10.2 and Android 4.3.1: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/80d/113/cda/80d113cda3b9489b9e521778276ea22f.png"><br><br>  This discovery slightly disappointed me, as I was expecting the latest version of both.  However, the altered Easter egg brought me the joy of life: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7f4/58f/f72/7f458ff7275d4af689d5f546cb810ab0.png"><br><br>  There were also huge opportunities for customization and personalization, in which you can rummage through the years.  After setting up the desktops, I was amazed by what I saw: everything looked very cool and cool, but it did not slow down at all: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/513/242/c9a/513242c9a35e4cd1ab849a2710317a74.png"><br><br>  But there were also disadvantages: until I found (or there isn‚Äôt) the possibility of endless scrolling of tables, it would not work (for now) to group the icon in the menu, besides, they are sorted alphabetically, so we got a little more than 2 pages filled out completely - not very convenient: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d5c/819/302/d5c8193024234148b648c5dc69c9f88d.png"><br><br>  The lock screen settings are also extensive, but there are still flaws in some places: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9b5/6c4/c72/9b56c4c725584c1da68bf1b9bd2f1c2c.png"><br>  My main goal was accomplished with this installation: the device was seriously freshened up and began again to delight with its work.  However, a number of shortcomings also emerged: eating the battery has become more active, although in articles about cyanogenmod they write that the situation will improve after a while.  In the same mystical way, the sending of SMS was stopped, although this function was not really in demand before, and the curious absence of the ‚Äú‚Äù and ‚Äú‚Äù symbols was found on the keyboard: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/beb/871/e9b/beb871e9bc864330b201b03e3ab3095a.png"><br><br>  The situation with the battery decides the powersave mode in the performance settings, but turns the phone into a very slow device. <br><br>  In the end, I consider the move to cayanogenmod ‚Äúfor dummies‚Äù a good one.  There was a sudden idea to move to cyanogenmod 11 or even wait for 12 and jump in there, but that's another story. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/363719/">https://habr.com/ru/post/363719/</a></p>
