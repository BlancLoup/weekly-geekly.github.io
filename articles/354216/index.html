  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Forbes: Alibaba and Uber have become the most profitable companies for investors</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In early April, the American magazine Forbes <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/truebridge/2018/04/03/top-10-companies-behind-the-2018-midas-list-exits-and-unicorns-that-helped-their-investors-the-most/">published</a> its annual <a href="https://www.forbes.com/midas/">Midas List</a> , a ranking of the 100 most successful venture capital investors in the world.  In addition, the publication has calculated and which companies have brought the greatest profit to investors for the past year. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1i/s2/tv/1is2tvs9xjm9rdrsufhbureokx0.png"><br><br>  According to analysts, the "main driver of growth" of the wealthiest investors became their investments in Chinese companies.  So, this year, the Alibaba Group has become the most profitable for them, and only six of the top 10 companies in the Middle Kingdom represent China.  The second most profitable asset was the American Uber. <a name="habracut"></a>

    <h2>  Which company brought the greatest profit to investors </h2><br>  According to the research methodology, companies that entered the stock exchange more than five years ago cannot be present in the rating.  Therefore, this year Facebook was excluded from the Midas list, which remained one of the main sources of income for investors - the IPO of the social network for $ 100 billion was held in 2012. <br><br><ol><li>  Alibaba - Chinese ecommerce giant topped the list.  In 2014, the company conducted the largest $ 25 billion IPO in US history. </li><li>  Uber - taxi service remains one of the most expensive companies in the world, despite its failures in 2017, says Forbes.  The company has planned an IPO for 2019. </li><li>  Didi Chuxing - Chinese taxi service ranked eighth in last year‚Äôs ranking.  A new round of financing helped her rise in the list, during which her estimate grew to $ 56 billion. </li><li>  Snap, the owner of Snapchat, held an IPO in 2017, and in early 2018, the company's shares rose 20% on the back of positive quarterly reports. </li><li>  JD.com is one of the main competitors of Alibaba: the company's share in the Chinese e-commerce market was 25% versus 55% in Alibaba, analysts say. </li><li>  Xiaomi - according to journalists, the smartphone maker can spend the ICPO in 2018, and business valuation in this case will be $ 100 billion. </li><li>  Airbnb - according to project founder Brian Chesky, said the company has no plans to hold an IPO this year. </li><li>  China Internet Plus is a Chinese telecommunications company that emerged from the merger of two large Chinese companies Meituan and Dianping in 2015. </li><li>  WhatsApp - the company's influence on the Midas list has decreased since four years have passed since the purchase of the Facebook messenger.  However, business growth continues, which benefits investors. </li><li>  Toutiao is a Chinese media service that is used by approximately 700 million people. </li></ol><br><h2>  What else </h2><br>  The main purpose of the Midas List is to compile a rating of the most successful venture capital investors.  Therefore, the attention of the press is mostly riveted to this part of it.  It also has some interesting points. <br><br>  For example, the current list has become the most international in the entire history - it includes 79 investors from the United States, 14 from China, three from the UK, two from Switzerland, and a number of countries are represented in the list by one capitalist. <br><br>  Billionaire and the founder of the DST fund Yuri Milner for the year dropped from 15 to 52 place in the list and remains the only representative of Russia in the rating of successful investors. <br><br><h2>  Other materials on finance and stock market from <a href="https://iticapital.ru/">ITI Capital</a> : </h2><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://iticapital.ru/research-education/education/events/">ITI Capital Educational Resources</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://iticapital.ru/research-education/research/">Analytics and market reviews</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/iticapital/blog/352846/">Distrust of authority and economy: the main trends of millenial investment activity</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/iticapital/blog/345860/">Where it is more profitable to buy currency: banks vs exchange</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/iticapital/blog/350092/">How the implementation of trading systems with artificial intelligence will affect investment management</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/iticapital/blog/348792/">Bloomberg: how Ilon Mask‚Äôs sale of flame throwers will change start-up financing</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/354216/">https://habr.com/ru/post/354216/</a></p>
