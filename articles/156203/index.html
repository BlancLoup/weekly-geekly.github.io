Impressions of the presentation of Win8 and Surface</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Probably many of you watched the presentation of Windows 8 and Surface from Microsoft.  In this article, I will try to formulate my opinion on why Microsoft will manage to jump into the outgoing train and chop off the market from Apple and Android. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Many people say that the market is already divided, a million applications and devices have been sold, vendekapepets.  But there is one BUT. <br><br>  It is known that Microsoft profukal mobile market even with Windows CE.  Steve Ballmer tore out his sparse hairs, but officially recognized that marking time with Windows CE was a mistake.  The same company once gave the Internet market without a fight.

      His Majesty Aiphon ruled the scene and everyone's favorite fruit company cut the bills on an industrial scale.  This is silly not to recognize - Apple has created this market.  Through the efforts (read money) of loyal fans, along with excellent engineers and designers, the company created not just a device but a new style of interaction with the communicator.  Then Android appeared and filled the world with a zoo of models for every taste color and pocket.  I still have the LG Optimus, bought for $ 180.  And it's great to have a working smartphone with internet, satellite navigation and applications for $ 100 -200 $.  Not to mention the flagship models.  And then the tablets went. <br><br>  Agree, the situation at Microsoft was critical.  Windows Mobile was ending its life in navigators and old phones.  Zune was an interesting device, but the iPod captured almost the entire market, leaving little space for various vendors with usb key rings.  And there were 2 ways: <br><br><ul><li>  Play catch-up with Apple and release something similar to iPhone </li><li>  Go your own way </li></ul><br><br>  And I am glad that this company had enough eggs to create absolutely their device and present it to the market.  After all, the android, may his fans forgive me, it‚Äôs certainly for a lot of tracing from the iPhone on the interface. <br><br>  And Microsoft went for it and started to create an interface from scratch.  And they did it.  If there could still be a holivar between Yablokochnik and Androidov, who then stole it, then it was definitely clear - this is completely his and his own.  And they would have an interesting telephone with their own market strategy, but they just decided to go further and combine all three devices under one roof. <br><br><h5>  Windows 8 and WindowsRT. <br></h5><br><br>  From now on, your computer is a tablet and a tablet is your computer.  This is certainly an innovative strong and risky move.  Not for nothing on the presentation of Windows8 around the speakers stood a dozen ready-made device models - and all had one system.  From tablet to widescreen TV.  After the presentation, it becomes clear that since 2013, no sane manufacturer will do a laptop (and monitor) without a multitouch. <br>  All devices have a single interface and <b>ONE</b> applications.  Now, creating a game for the tablet, the developer receives not only the buyers on the tablets but also the buyers on the PC, TVs and so on.  One big market.  Plus, the modification on the winphone is not difficult.  Well, the games are written in XNA.  And this is the XBOX in the piggy bank. <br><br>  This is a knight's move that will change the market.  This is much more innovative than Apple‚Äôs ‚Äú20% thinner‚Äù.  Now it is not clear how the Cupertino company will be able to surprise next year.  Race for subtlety and power will not help.  Only one way out - to do the same, to merge devices into one.  But on their laptops presented a few days ago there is not even a multitouch display. <br><br>  And for developers, this is a hungry market where you can send power.  After all, in the iOS and Android market is no longer crowded. <br>  In general, I congratulate all the developers on the new promising mobile market.  2013 will show I was right or not :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/156203/">https://habr.com/ru/post/156203/</a></p>
