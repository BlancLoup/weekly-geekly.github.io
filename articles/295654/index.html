It is therefore not surprising that brands are trying to use this social network to attract customers.  <b>Artem Sova</b> , Head of Targeted Advertising, ArrowMedia (Kokoc Group), told how to find buyers of their goods and services on Instagram. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/e3a/fd0/5f4/e3afd05f45cd71738713e119b387fef7.jpg" alt="image"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  As in any other social network, publishing and commenting on photos and videos on Instagram, users ‚Äúleave traces‚Äù of their preferences, which allows brands to target advertising precisely - show it to groups of people with certain interests.  However, the behavior of ‚Äúinstagrammers‚Äù differs from the users of VKontakte and Facebook: they perceive information visually, and not as text.  Therefore, talking about the company's products is not words, but beautiful and creative photos.

      But let's move from words to deeds.  Registration of the account should be directly dependent on the challenges facing your advertising campaign on Instagram.  In our case, we are talking about the sale of goods and services, rather than acquaintance with the brand and the accumulation of an active subscriber base. <br><br>  <b>The first option is landing</b> .  All photos in your account are put together in one puzzle - a large general image of a product or service or a scene of their use.  Then it makes sense to specify the value of the goods and talk about its uniqueness.  Be sure to add a call to action Call-to-Action. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f7d/966/179/f7d96617966b4fc0bda4852e29c9502d.jpg"><br><br>  <b>The second option is to create a product catalog.</b>  Each photo becomes a kind of product card with its high-quality image, name and value.  It is clear that it would be nice to take all the photos in the same style.  As a result, the user opens a beautifully decorated showcase of goods. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a2e/a59/466/a2ea59466776479bab0690bbd223e16e.jpg"><br><br>  <b>The third option is training.</b>  For many users, it is important to understand how to apply the product, so it is useful to publish a series of reportage photos and video clips in the company's account that demonstrate either the process or the results of using the product. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c08/85b/0cc/c0885b0cc25448b49b0274c88916f203.jpg"><br><br>  Whichever option you choose, it is worthwhile to include in the description of the public the uniqueness of the offer and the noticeable ‚ÄúOrder‚Äù button.  By the way, its use in the description of goods will significantly increase the likelihood of purchase. <br>  The next step is to attract active users who are interested in your product or service.  With a small budget for promotion, you can use the least expensive ways: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Mass Folding - subscribe to user accounts. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Likes - like photos of users. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Spam - leave comments with a message about the company under the photos of users. <br><br>  Massfollowing, liking and spam can be done by hand in the comments, but it is easier to use automatic tools: Tuligrams, Instatul, One Million Likes.  For example, Tuligram allows you to select an audience by hashtags, interests, gender, geolocation and competitors.  The resulting list of users can also be filtered by the number of subscriptions, subscribers, likes and comments.  The tool will automatically attract attention to your account in the selected way: subscribe to the gathered audience or leave comments and likes.  Just keep in mind that like and spam should be careful, otherwise you can run into a negative reaction from users and get a ban on your public. <br><br>  Companies with large advertising budgets can take advantage of quick ways to attract users: buy posts in popular publics through the stock exchange or run targeted advertising on Instagram through Facebook. <br><br>  In the first case, advertisers buy likes, subscriptions and posts, as well as place their advertising messages in suitable public places, using exchanges and attracting intermediaries.  The advantages of exchanges are that they take on all communication with group administrators, give guarantees of publication and provide an account of the number of views and clicks.  For example, we use DealWay.ru, labelup.ru, plibber.ru and <a href="http://www.instach.ru/">www.instach.ru</a> . <br><br>  When creating advertising posts, it is necessary to take into account the peculiarities of each group, to adapt texts and images for a specific community, otherwise users will leave them unattended or react negatively.  For example, if you advertise a watch in a group about celebrities, the image should be made in the style of "Leonardo DiCaprio with your watch on hand." <br><br>  In the second case, access to the Instagram audience can be expanded through Facebook, which acquired a social network in 2015 and opened up similar targeting opportunities to advertisers (gender, age, behavior, interests, geolocation).  Today, advertising to a specific group of users is available within the Instagram mobile app for Android and IOS.  Using this tool, it is possible to bring "Ingragrammers" not only to the brand account in the social network, but also to the company's external website or to the Google Play and App Store mobile app stores. <br><br>  For successful promotion in Instagram it is useful to test and combine various ways of promotion.  For example, start with the design of the page as a product catalog and advertise it with the help of husking and folloving, and having obtained the first results, increase the budget and enter the advertising exchanges. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/295654/">https://habr.com/ru/post/295654/</a></p>
