A week and a half ago I collected her first draft and in the coming months I will gradually tighten it up.  In the spring, I wrote down a simple mini-site, which at the current stage simply <a href="https://www.uxstrategy.co/">collected all the links to articles in the series</a> (in Russian and English).  As you work on a book, it will grow into useful tools in addition to the text.  So far, the key idea seems to be a set of design management patterns around which everything will play. <br><br>  Hopefully next year will be able to publish a book.

Although <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/pdigest/permalink/780710728659152/">these purchases have been going on for many years</a> and they have already managed to get used to them, Cooper is a backbone company.  Her purchase is the final end of an era, the collapse of foundations, another nail in the UX-agency.  I would not say that it is sad, but it is difficult not to reflect on this watershed. <br><br> <a href="https://designit.com/happening/news/cooper-joins-designit"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/da0/435/ffa/da0435ffa3e7338716b06c399c43b007.jpg" alt="Cooper joins designit" width="780" height="390"></a> <br><br>  Since the 90s, such a model has emerged in its head - UX-agencies are bringing new methods and approaches to the industry thanks to the breadth of their clientele and projects, and product teams are successfully applying these methods.  It is clear that in recent years, product teams have given out no less interesting new approaches for the benefit of the profession, as evidenced by at least a huge number of blogs and sites of design teams.  But all the same there was a feeling that the product teams still had more about how to produce a good design and less about serious research methods.  On the other hand, how difficult it was for grocery teams to frequently change these ideally described methods in real life is a signal that we need to start from the other side, with the natural limitations of the grocery work.  But you can't change the mental model just like that :) For me, this moment finally came with the news about Cooper.  It's funny that the domestic community hasn't really caught the news - apparently, for the new generation Cooper means little.  Also an interesting signal. <br><br>  Other purchases of design studios by large companies: <br><br><ul><li>  The manufacturer of corporate services <a href="https://www.dtelepathy.com/blog/news-events/elevating-lifes-experiences-at-lightspeed">ServiceNow bought the design studio Digital Telepathy</a> . </li><li>  <a href="https://medium.com/building-creative-market/the-independent-future-of-creative-market-ebdc16991bec">Creative Market went against the trend and left Autodesk</a> , which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/03/19/autodesk-buys-creative-market-jumping-into-maker-marketplace/">bought them in 2014</a> . </li></ul><br><h2>  Conference proceedings </h2><br>  <strong><a href="https://medium.com/microsoft-design/croissants-coffee-and-creativity-5c9785653554">Croissants, Coffee, and Creativity</a></strong> <strong><a href="https://medium.com/microsoft-design/croissants-coffee-and-creativity-5c9785653554"><br></a></strong>  Interview with David Conrad of Microsoft, the creator of the series of meetings, Creative Mornings, about how he appeared and developed - today takes place in 175 cities around the world. <br><br>  <em>Fresh links can also be tracked in the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/pdigest/">Facebook group of the</a> same name or <a href="http://eepurl.com/bu61XX">received once a month by mail</a> .</em>  <em>Thanks to everyone who also publishes links in it, especially Gennady Dragun, Pavel Skripkin, Dmitry Podluzhny, Anton Artyomov, Denis Efremov, Alexey Kopylov, Taras Brizitsky, Yevgeny Sokolov and Anton Oleinik.</em>  <em>More and more materials in reviews appear thanks to them.</em> <br><blockquote>  <strong><a href="http://eepurl.com/bu61XX">Subscribe to the newsletter</a></strong> !
