And a little more than a week ago, I became the owner of a matte monster - the Dell Vostro 3750. Why did I choose it?  Read on and beware of heaps of pictures ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Why choose Vostro 3750 </h4><br>  Having spent several years with a glossy screen, glancing at my wife‚Äôs matte laptop screen (ThinkPad T60), I realized that I would never again take a laptop with a glossy screen and under no circumstances.  But my dreams were constantly broken by the market.yandex, yielding a meager list of notebook models when I clicked on the cherished tick "matte", not to mention the other important parameters: a large (at least 17 ") screen and a decent video card from nVidia. And of course I wanted meet the personal psychological barrier of 30,000 rubles. <br>  Finally, the miracle happened ... <br><br><h4>  Specifications </h4><br>  It is worth noting that I took the cheapest configuration, nevertheless for all that I need it more than enough: <br>  <b>Processor:</b> Intel¬Æ Core ‚Ñ¢ i3 (or i5 or i7, depending on the version) <br>  <b>Chipset:</b> Intel¬Æ HM67 Express <br>  <b>Graphics subsystem:</b> Intel¬Æ HD Graphics and nVidia GeForce GT525M <br>  <b>RAM:</b> 4 GB PC3-10660 DDR3 <br>  <b>Data storage:</b> 320GB hard drive <br>  <b>Optical drive:</b> 8X DVD ¬± RW with the ability to record dual-layer DVD ¬± R <br>  <b>Operating system:</b> Microsoft Windows 7 Home Premium 64bit <br>  <b>Display:</b> 17.3 ", 1600x900, with anti-reflective coating <br>  <b>Connectors:</b> VGA, HDMI, RJ-45 (10/100/1000), 2xUSB2.0, 2xUSB 3.0, eSATA (combined with one of USB2.0), 34mm ExpressCard, headphone and microphone jack <br>  <b>Wireless interfaces:</b> 802.11 b / g / n and Bluetooth Combo (BT V3.0 + HS) <br>  <b>Card reader:</b> SD / MMC / MS / etc. <br>  <b>Touchpad</b> with gesture support and a <b>full-size keyboard</b> with an additional numeric keypad (optionally also backlit) <br>  <b>Camera:</b> FullHD, up to 1920x1080 <br>  <b>Security:</b> fingerprint reader <br>  <b>Battery:</b> Li-Ion 6 or 8 cells, operating time 2-3 hours in Archlinux after turning off the second video card (and 1-2 hours when it is turned on, but without activity) <br>  <b>Dimensions:</b> 418x286x34 mm <br>  <b>Weight:</b> 3 kg <br><br><h4>  Appearance </h4><br>  Appearance is the last thing that interested me in the selection of a laptop, but nevertheless it looks decent (the hardware is focused on business, but there is no respectable to go with pink laptops and rhinestones). <br>  The weight of the laptop is only 3kg and, with its dimensions, it seems very light.  Of course, this laptop is more suitable for replacing a desktop PC than a mobile companion, but I was already used to dragging 4-5kg old laptop and a handful of little things to boot, so the Dell Vostro 3750 did not cause any discomfort (unless it got into the old bag). <br>  Describe the appearance of IMHO does not make much sense, it is better just to look and draw personal conclusions: like or dislike. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/ea7340b3/2fa8c7ec/527152e5/eef8a402.jpg">

Touchpad with trip indicator.  And a fingerprint reader (convenient for authorization, but no more). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/29b6464b/bc5cdb0c/da814951/839a4b62.jpg"><br>  On the left side there is a cooling system grill, eSATA combined with a USB2.0 port, HDMI, microphone input, headphone output and a card reader slot. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/04a8ac02/c59f80e9/fc4b53a0/7ee0a3e9.jpg"><br>  All status LEDs are located on the front end of the notebook and do not interfere with their glow at night or during the day. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/060c9414/150870dd/2be40a1d/f7713197.jpg"><br>  The ExpressCard connector, a DVD drive and 3 USB ports are located on the right side, one of which provides power when the computer is off (sometimes conveniently), and the other two USB 3.0 (unfortunately you cannot boot from external USB drives). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/715b371f/8e93eb1b/23a0756c/461d87c3.jpg"><br>  Power connectors, VGA and Ethernet at the rear end. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/2c497e12/eabd892e/63e18b1d/9d35fa7f.jpg"><br>  Bottom huge cover closes access to two memory slots and hard drive. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/023526fe/7dc9d20c/9cacd583/f2f48296.jpg"><br>  Screen mount <br><br>  And of course the matte screen in comparison with the glossy with not very bright sun. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/f7f7efcf/b1cf7db5/3f14b938/12471bab.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/f3bafc02/c2db6edd/c772bd00/a35edce5.jpg"><br><br>  The only drawback of the matte screen is that the black color is poorly transmitted, or rather it does not transmit at all, dark gray instead, and this is noticeable when watching movies in the evening with the lights off, otherwise there is no discomfort, only positive emotions. <br><br><h4>  Windows </h4><br>  I did not expect this, but after loading the desktop, nothing happened, that is, I was waiting for thousands of programs and widgets, half of which would ask to buy them, and the other successfully eat resources, but instead, the usual, unchallenged Windows 7 Home Premium with a boring but stylish wallpaper. <br>  About 4 or 5 years ago, I moved from Windows to Linux (mandriva-&gt; ubuntu-&gt; archlinux), so instead of an impressive description, only a few screenshots of programs that are usually used for similar articles. <br><br>  Performance index (the system is loaded from USB2.0 media, so the index is noticeably lower) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/6441355a/7e5cbedf/64665897/76ab9350.png"><br><br>  CPU <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/95643070/2d476d5d/d7c46474/7cb0d757.png"><br><br>  Video <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/e7e98265/754a189d/d8f51799/e82ba2e4.png"><br><br>  From myself I will add that the STALKER benchmark: Call of Pripyat issued 29FPS (from 15 to 47 depending on the scene) at the maximum settings (but without smoothing) with a resolution of 1600x900, the new Battlefield 3 works fine on medium settings at the same native resolution, but the last one 3D mark fairly slowed down (2-5fps), but produced a very beautiful picture of the underwater world. <br><br><h4>  Linux </h4><br>  And here the most interesting begins, even at the moment of choice I thought that I want a more quickly updated distribution with the highest possible settings, so the choice fell on ArchLinux and for good reason.  All the main devices worked out of the box (I did not try the fingerprint scanner) and the touchpad needed to assemble and install psmouse-elantech from the AUR to make the scrolling work.  I also had to tinker with a hybrid video system, but there was no particular difficulty here - I installed bumblebee-git from AUR and set up instructions from the wiki - everything worked fine, I tested it on the Trine game and in the browser webGL tests in Chromium. <br><br>  The average <b>battery life of the</b> laptop was approximately 1.5 hours, with maximum illumination, without energy saving and with an active Wi-Fi connection. <br><br>  <b>Video performance test on glxgears</b> : <br>  # glxinfo | grep renderer <br>  OpenGL renderer string: Mesa DRI Intel¬Æ Sandybridge Mobile <br>  gears showed <i>60 FPS</i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/d83ca650/b4d95aef/bfba461b/9cbdacaa.png"><br><br>  # optirun glxinfo | grep renderer <br>  OpenGL renderer string: GeForce GT 525M / PCI / SSE2 <br>  gears showed <i>1050 FPS</i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/dc981afc/354ff728/68cec0d9/2795c7c3.png"><br><br>  On nVidia, all the WebGL demos earned, including the <a href="http://www.chromeexperiments.com/detail/webgl-water-simulation">beautiful water effect</a> , which did not want to work on Intel HD. <br><br>  <b>Disk system test</b> : <br><br>  Read speed of internal SATA disk <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/763c877d/a5bed5d1/9b15ca95/8539be61.png"><br><br>  USB 2.0 read speed <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/f5597b60/c9928e3e/00b6b747/750ce590.png"><br><br>  USB 3.0 reading speed (I dare to suggest that the speed could be higher) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/7085bb7f/e985ca77/2d0d72a4/027cd905.png"><br><br>  The speed of reading the same disk, but when connected to SATA (similar to USB3.0 connection) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/d8d333c0/873aa425/cda25fac/897d50ee.png"><br><br><h4>  Total </h4><br>  The laptop in this configuration cost me 26,860 rubles, in my opinion a very tasty price for such a machine. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/b0f43498/74daaa2c/94e82103/98cca3c3.png">  Matte screen and almost matte body <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/b0f43498/74daaa2c/94e82103/98cca3c3.png">  Hybrid video system: Intel + nVidia <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/b0f43498/74daaa2c/94e82103/98cca3c3.png">  Comfortable keyboard <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/b0f43498/74daaa2c/94e82103/98cca3c3.png">  Fingerprint protection (who needs and who believes in it) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/b0f43498/74daaa2c/94e82103/98cca3c3.png">  Price <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/3d8f9c25/2b97c2d8/1a6490a7/9fea2f23.png">  Not very good screen for watching movies, but matte <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/3d8f9c25/2b97c2d8/1a6490a7/9fea2f23.png">  No keyboard backlight <br><br>  As a result, the laptop is very satisfied, it remains to pick out an unnecessary DVD drive and put in place another SATA disk.  I hope it will serve me more than one year and withstand the frost, heat, snow and rain just like the old roverbook w700. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/131969/">https://habr.com/ru/post/131969/</a></p>
