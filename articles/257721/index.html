In the publication you will find a detailed description of the classic design patterns with the peculiarities of their implementation on the .NET platform, as well as examples of their use in the .NET Framework.  You will also learn design principles known by the acronym SOLID, and learn how to apply them when developing your own applications. <br>  The book is intended for professional programmers who want to study the features of classical principles and programming patterns with examples in C # and understand their role in the development of modern applications on the .NET platform. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

    <h5>  about the author </h5><br>  Sergey Teplyakov has been developing software for over ten years.  During this time, he went from being a junior embedded system developer to an architect at one of Europe‚Äôs leading outsourcing companies, and then moved to Microsoft‚Äôs DevDiv development department. <br>  Sergey is the author of a blog dedicated to programming, <a href="http://sergeyteplyakov.blogspot.ru/">Programming Stuff</a> , in which several hundred articles of various subjects have been published.  Since 2011, Sergey was the owner of the Microsoft C # MVP title, which he lost when he moved to Microsoft at the end of 2014.  The main interest of the author lies in the field of system design, pragmatic use of principles and design patterns, as well as combining object-oriented and functional programming. <br><br><h5>  Who is this book for? </h5><br>  The book is intended for professional developers who are interested in design issues.  The book will bring the greatest benefit to programmers who have several years of experience with the C # language behind them, a basic knowledge of object-oriented programming and design patterns. <br>  I would advise less experienced developers to read this book twice: now and in a few years, when the look at the development will change under the influence of the new experience.  The process of knowledge in general and the study of design issues in particular is iterative.  Practical experience and full of bumps allow us to look at such ‚Äútheoretical‚Äù and seemingly uninteresting questions as patterns from a completely different point of view. <br>  For experienced developers, the book will be useful as a means of generalizing knowledge.  Classical patterns here are considered from all possible points of view, so it is quite possible that the author was able to show them from those sides that you did not think about. <br>  The target platform uses the .NET Framework and the C # language.  Some of the materials are quite tied to the features of the platform and programming language.  If your main programming language is C ++ or Java, then the book will still be useful, since a significant part of it is devoted to design issues, which depend little on a programming language. <br><br><h5>  How to read this book </h5><br>  This book is not a textbook, which involves a clear sequence of reading.  All chapters on design patterns are autonomous, they can be read independently of each other.  The last part of the book is devoted to the principles of design and slightly intersects with its other parts. <br>  The book can be used as a reference for deepening knowledge about a particular principle or pattern.  I would still advise first to read the book from beginning to end in order to form a general idea or refresh knowledge in the field of design.  This will make it possible to return to a specific chapter later, when the need for in-depth knowledge of a particular pattern becomes apparent in order to make it more successful in practice. <br><br>  More information about the book can be found on <a href="http://www.piter.com/product%3Fproduct_id%3D39684273">the publisher's website.</a> <br>  <a href="http://storage.piter.com/upload/contents/978549601649/978549601649_X.pdf">Table of contents</a> <br>  <a href="http://storage.piter.com/upload/contents/978549601649/978549601649_p.pdf">Excerpt</a> <br><br>  For habrozhiteley 25% discount on the coupon - <b>Design patterns</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/257721/">https://habr.com/ru/post/257721/</a></p>
