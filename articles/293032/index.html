      It is no secret that online business is gaining momentum, and the trend is increasing each time.  Why some people treat him negatively, while others really make money on it. <br><br>  Not everyone knows or does not suspect that infobusiness has been around for a long time, it was just indirect, for example, the same specialized manuals like ‚ÄúHow to open your farm‚Äù, ‚ÄúBasics of landscape design‚Äù, etc.  Now info-business has moved to another form - direct sale of their knowledge, experience - that is, consulting, webinars, trainings, consultations, lectures, courses, and more. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/eb5/6c3/e38/eb56c3e38969c4642f1caedb850ab6a3.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  How do infobusinessmen earn? </h4><br>  Despite the frivolous attitude to this area on the part of the ignorant, this is very hard work, which requires a person of infinite dedication, a desire to learn and move on with any turn of events. <br><br>  Many people confuse infobusiness with network marketing, even consider that these concepts are related, mix it up with a bunch of dirt and are called a scam.  But infobusiness is INFO, that is, information, intellectual property, which has a price, and network marketing, in fact, monitoring the work of others and getting money for it, but this is not about that now. <br><br>  Why, with the concept of "infobusiness", many clients come to mind that this is a scam?  In addition to incorrect presentation - in the inaccuracy in drawing up the headlines, which we see on the Internet ‚ÄúBecome a Millionaire‚Äù almost in a week, ‚ÄúGet your first million,‚Äù etc., the proposal itself seems incomprehensible.  This is due to the fact that the info business came to Russia not too long ago, and we are accustomed to making money ‚Äúin the old manner‚Äù.  Of course, we ourselves see this as a trick.  Information is presented incorrectly, and people have the impression of the infobusiness as another trick to tear off their money. <br><br>  In fact, infobusiness is not only learning earnings in the network.  In fact, these are people who provide any useful information to other people.  We are faced with various info-businessmen in everyday life everywhere: from an English tutor to a weight loss instructor - all this activity is in one way or another an info-business, namely providing valuable information for money.  However, in our society, it is considered to be only info-businessmen who sell their knowledge on the Internet. <br><br><h4>  So, let us consider in practice the principles of earnings in infobusiness. </h4><br>  In theory, the scheme of work is quite simple.  Naturally, any deviations from this system are possible, but the general idea is exactly that. <br>  There are five key concepts: Base, Traffic, Cover, Offer and Content.  They can be called anything but the meaning does not change. <br><br>  <b>Base</b> - a way to interact with customers.  For example, your website and subscription base. <br>  <b>Traffic</b> - sources of customer acquisition.  For example, Yandex.Direct <br>  <b>Cover</b> - useful material, as a rule, free.  It is necessary for the info-businessman to earn trust and prove his authority for the client. <br>  <b>Offer</b> - motivates the client to pay for services and get much more useful information. <br>  <b>Content</b> - information required by the client.  Served in various forms: books, video courses, personal training, etc. <br><br>  <i>In the following articles we will look at these aspects in more detail.</i> <br><br>  Let us give an example of the simplest scheme, which works with due effort at all without investment by the info-businessman. <br>  A group in a social network is chosen as the Base - completely free, simple and understandable to potential customers.  Traffic is also taken from the social.  networks: active invitations, reposts, posting in foreign groups.  Actually, after these manipulations, a certain audience of interested people gathers, who are invited to a non-free webinar.  This version of the Cover is very convenient at the start - no need to spend time writing letters, developing landing pages, and calling customers. <br><br>  <i>We will also talk about how to conduct a successful webinar in other articles.</i> <br><br>  During the webinar, the audience receives a part of the answers to their questions.  After that, there is an offer to pay for the course of webinars, in which this topic is covered more extensively. <br><br>  Profit from such an event can be thirty-forty thousand, while the cost is not more than three thousand rubles, and such events for the month can be done at least 3-4 times. <br><br>  Naturally, this is just the tip of the iceberg.  With various combinations of methods of presenting information, an infobusinessman will be able to earn millions.  Not everyone can achieve heights, but everyone can try himself!  We will talk more about techniques, tools and much more next time. <br><br>  <i>See you,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Team Ruholding!</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/293032/">https://habr.com/ru/post/293032/</a></p>
