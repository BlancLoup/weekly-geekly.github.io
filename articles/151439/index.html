      Badoo occupies almost the whole floor - the total office area is about 1200 meters.  They moved here recently, in August.  But at the same time the office does not seem deserted - they managed to make a good living. <br><br>  So, let's begin.  The first thing that employees of the company and guests who come to the office - reception.  Clickable: <br><br> <a href="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/6511/2438272.13/0_7a2c2_d052677f_orig"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1d6/a02/b04/1d6a02b045869c829673bf0e6231d468.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  The backlight is implemented quite interesting - the company's LED logo is located behind a thick frosted glass, due to which an effective dispersion is achieved. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/315/55a/654/31555a654b6f33f1d0e3acbd5348dd93.jpg"><br><br>  Notice that the table is a bit "crooked"?  This is not an accident.  Pretty soon, you involuntarily pay attention to the ‚Äúirregular‚Äù forms of all the rooms - all this is the result of the work of the design studio Za Bor, who attached themselves to the creation of the Moscow office of the company (and the offices of a number of other companies, such as Yandex around the world). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cc7/f0e/866/cc7f0e866f1e2ad6d8426d669c688f6f.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/83d/b70/99a/83db7099a29558280b4f011f1977dfd1.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bc3/a6a/84e/bc3a6a84eddf3d9b74e618582e504775.jpg"><br><br>  What else immediately attracts attention?  The fact that the interior has a large number of natural flowers and plants, they are literally everywhere: at the entrance, on the dining tables, in the negotiations, on the walls.  One would think that only girls work in the company, but, looking ahead, this is not so. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b63/814/8f4/b638148f4956888c1f3118415b49d4e2.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/059/7cd/af0/0597cdaf0d2dac6f130acb97139c4f41.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/eb2/b41/cbe/eb2b41cbeb5ce513aade719d5adde1fb.jpg"><br><br>  This is not just about boring ficuses or ‚Äúbamboos‚Äù from Ikea, but about large and beautiful bouquets made up by florists - those who give flowers to girls know that this pleasure is not cheap.  But a company with a multimillion audience can quite afford it - specially trained people are responsible for the beauty. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bab/98f/945/bab98f945860f24c955f9f9775a7eb19.jpg"><br><br>  Habrayuzer's keen eye probably noticed the glass doors immediately behind the reception?  Or rather, the inscription on them - Server room.  In server rooms usually let very reluctantly, but not in this case;  here, on the contrary - ‚Äúcome, go!‚Äù and even turned on the light. <br><br>  <s>Warmly</s> Fresh.  Several racks in which all the wires are laid very carefully, with a soul.  Unfortunately, without a ‚Äúwide-angle‚Äù, I can only boast of a gruff gluing of several photos: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a6c/618/e4f/a6c618e4ff967932351b67fdf1843d99.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/af7/3d4/1f6/af73d41f629422477318d70ebf1f5496.jpg"><br><br>  These servers are used solely for intra-office needs. <br><br>  Then all the photos are in the order in which we walked around the office.  We started with a large and spacious kitchen with panoramic windows - it is always light and cozy there. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/46b/d35/227/46bd3522752ca642dec28fe8290fc271.jpg"><br><br>  Tables with flowers and fruits, and on the other hand - a refrigerator, a cutting board and other kitchen utensils - very homely. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b7f/56e/8e2/b7f56e8e212663c3a7460a5d2ccda02d.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/02f/3f6/e3d/02f3f6e3d49059caa4474951a994468d.jpg"><br><br>  The fauna was added to the office flora - an aquarium with goldfish is built into one of the walls.  I made a wish, waiting for it to be fulfilled. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ab8/6f7/76a/ab86f776a153058d9e8abda335d1187f.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bf2/e8d/943/bf2e8d9435892cd29542694f639d3c99.jpg"><br><br>  The most attentive could notice in this photo a piece of the projector screen - it is lowered if necessary, and there are television broadcasts or Friday movie watching. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/887/25f/8bf/88725f8bf8197a2ec5a85467db012d6b.jpg"><br><br>  There is also a neat balcony with a beautiful view of the countryside.  Beauty clickable: <br><br> <a href="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/6412/2438272.13/0_7a2c3_50f275e7_orig"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/15d/f97/0dc/15df970dcf9e553f419d0536622ec3b3.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  Despite the presence of chairs on the balcony, you can not smoke here - for this there is a separate place.  And then so, breathe the air. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3f4/6ee/081/3f46ee081adc7b6c93157630ba060a22.jpg"><br><br>  Currently, the company has 95 employees, 85 of whom are programmers.  Such a composition pulls the title of Badoo Development - the rest of the staff is administrative.  Above, we talked about girls, they are here, neither more nor less, as many as 6 - apparently, in the company as sacred animals, their weight in gold. <br><br>  By and large, the office is a spacious open-space, in which only in some places there are walls.  Workplaces (photo at the time of opening the office). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/aac/646/bac/aac646bac0294e3b3da976d161b59cf8.jpg"><br><br>  And with the staff: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c40/7c9/243/c407c92433cdec24a33e670917c11080.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/862/467/829/862467829467a4bece9635d63e062eee.jpg"><br><br>  The average workplace of a programmer consists of a table, a comfortable chair and a computer suitable for tasks.  If pathos and outrage reigned everywhere in <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/office/124347/">the</a> Vkontakte <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/office/124347/">office</a> , then everything is a little different - it is the work process that is put in the foreground, nothing superfluous. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/901/413/002/901413002181fa87996d200132ab16d3.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/627/cf6/360/627cf63601e6b9ce986f8a88ffb0e29c.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1cd/2f1/07e/1cd2f107e277b9e32a6287b9fa2d4f3e.jpg"><br><br>  On a large whiteboard in the developers room, someone took an oath before our appearance. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9d1/b1e/119/9d1b1e1191d6034e6c7924a87b5771a4.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f32/1a5/609/f321a560945c0d8558a7673d7a2c8f35.jpg"><br><br>  "Sishniki" occupied a separate space in the office space with gray concrete walls. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/96a/5d2/a6f/96a5d2a6f65401ad7c2f7d3dca15e962.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/390/2cd/ebe/3902cdebef7183ee2907a9e2068014d9.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d40/9a2/86c/d409a286c9ab90e6cc0a34b74e2ac8e7.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/476/287/fa9/476287fa9696518f5753c022f6f37f7c.jpg"><br><br>  I liked the solution with partitions between the tables - they have grooves in which you can move various pieces: pencil cups, marker boards, lamps, and so on.  I have previously seen a similar solution only with <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/search/%3Fq%3Dherman%2Bmiller">Herman Miller</a> , whose products are actively used in the Badoo office. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/49b/644/66d/49b64466dd3c9b95d9cf64d7c9e499d7.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/aff/46c/ca8/aff46cca8a57f8888f912efadfe8cf51.jpg"><br><br>  By the way, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/toster/blog/145506/">remember</a> ? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/35f/b1f/bd4/35fb1fbd44357141ad0bf7422d55db36.jpg"><br><br>  Politically correct (with a <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/xek/" class="user_link">toaster</a> notebook) <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/xek/" class="user_link">Xek</a> - he once worked at Habr√©, then we did <b>Trendclub</b> together and now he works at Badoo. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dc2/847/76e/dc284776e71c7f732556a726599cbfc2.jpg"><br><br>  Heck's stern screen: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c84/ed0/7e6/c84ed07e6c0a9e74c5f4f71a4bab3005.jpg"><br><br>  Almost every company has a TV to which secret information is displayed - every time it is asked not to take pictures and every time I take pictures of it.  But in the publication, as always, nothing is visible. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/664/522/920/6645229202084173de0e1aaa3800c732.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/18f/88c/96e/18f88c96ec18b4282a4befbe3969543f.jpg"><br><br>  The office has 5 meeting rooms, each of which has its own name - according to the type of places where you can spend time.  Well, or make new acquaintances. <br><br>  <b>Library.</b>  Negotiation, the interior design of which is a bit like a library. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7e5/797/e30/7e5797e30c0b70980cae1211c769f69a.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c67/dc8/ee2/c67dc8ee21fd24284618c8d2745c4041.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Cinema.</b>  This room is already decorated in the form of a cinema. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/73d/b73/6a9/73db736a94872650ca124558abcfe2c1.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a74/b8e/699/a74b8e699b25052b3f6d2b1b59a7ce9d.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/840/c63/c8a/840c63c8a5d80e85125ae1e43d7edc00.jpg"><br><br>  In each room, as a rule, there is at least one wall with the ‚Äúfunction‚Äù of the marker board - so that by chance someone does not write with a marker on the projector screen (apparently, there was a case), they would hide it behind curtains. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/626/554/859/626554859b57918d87896fabf99d75cb.jpg"><br><br>  This is quite a cinema - you can display an image from a projector (which, although it hangs very close, but performs its function).  It is connected to the prefix PS, in which employees sometimes play. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/720/deb/2bc/720deb2bc114f5746452ff215ed81231.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Bar.</b>  As it is easy to guess, this is a bar - one of the walls is made in the form of a bar counter, on which there are bottles.  Decorative - there is no alcohol inside. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bdc/cf5/18c/bdccf518c8b55f11126ad6a4a34c6ab7.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8b7/453/56e/8b745356eb622fd410e6e448733ae68c.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/35b/374/aeb/35b374aeb1b6fd96bd37598a379c6007.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Park.</b>  Instead of a piece of the park there is, perhaps, the corresponding wallpaper and carpet in the form of green grass. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e7d/f0a/130/e7df0a130968791d5c1c6db9c0b56726.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/764/bb9/3c5/764bb93c5c68fb0bcab343a841122583.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/302/37c/f54/30237cf54158d7eaf892455a20483696.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Night club</b> - everything is clear here too.  Room with pieces of nightlife - not enough glass ball on the ceiling. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b7c/ef2/e0d/b7cef2e0d54c2a436d8ab6cf534e1f66.jpg"><br><br>  Quite an interesting decision with negotiations - I had seen before only the different names of the rooms, but not the different interior designs. <br><br>  In one of the corridors are three telephone booths - a tribute to the "English roots" of the company.  Inside you can meditate, but it is too early - they have recently been painted and now they are ventilated by the ‚Äúeggs‚Äù from HM. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fb3/f13/323/fb3f13323662fdf7c45c8c555af52ba6.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f04/52e/200/f0452e200045a14def3349ec0a332606.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/385/4a0/848/3854a0848912ff3d69b35c3991e7ea62.jpg"><br><br>  I liked the office very, very much - nothing to do with what I saw earlier.  It seems that you are no longer in Russia - you can usually find something like this only in some Europe.  It‚Äôs just fine to drive a segway around the office, but for now everything is simpler - there are several scooters instead. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/938/f2f/2ff/938f2f2ffb24169d63ee8aba50c78dfe.jpg"><br><br>  If someone rolls and sweats, there is a shower - only for this ‚Äúoption‚Äù in the office I would give a lot. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/06e/0f0/6f4/06e0f06f4ee723995e627689c15eed70.jpg"><br><br>  Again, fresh flowers: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/44c/ffc/327/44cffc327b91e37aa6e13f26ea5b9f3e.jpg"><br><br>  Another of the entertainment - a board for darth, table tennis and game consoles;  maybe something else will appear later - there‚Äôs a place like that. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8e6/98f/e39/8e698fe398e0a4f375b0df6bd0c83032.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c49/fa4/a64/c49fa4a64e8540d4c417821bb2048ecd.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e6c/72a/17c/e6c72a17c3f276e09c286ba280cb02eb.jpg"><br><br>  In the last room I managed to take only two photos, after which the camera hung on - the concentration of smoke in the smoking room.  For nicotine <s>addicts</s> in the office there is a separate room with sofas, <s>blackjack</s> , hookah, guitar and whiteboard. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/789/40a/1bf/78940a1bff1e73bfc564848f46451167.jpg"><br><br>  UFO-flavored pattern: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/745/773/693/74577369349f6b02e9d6b1086a930781.jpg"><br><br>  In general, as in any large company, branding is very developed here - the company logo flaunts almost everywhere where possible.  Here, for example, "Tsisk": <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ce2/6e6/c25/ce26e6c25b83fc4c506fcaa02168c0c7.jpg"><br><br>  Or stickers on the front door of the office: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/996/a15/e34/996a15e34f6fee1895198d622d643508.jpg"><br><br>  There is even a separate wall on which photographs of employees and guests - I decided to take a photo as a keepsake) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ee2/d0e/e74/ee2d0ee74a731ab0db7563c21004211e.jpg"><br><br>  By the way, not so long ago, in an informal setting, I was called to work for a company - if I hadn‚Äôt already had a wonderful job, I would have agreed without hesitation :) I suppose that, besides everything I saw above, working at Badoo has many other advantages, so the advice is if they call, do not try to refuse! <br><br>  <b><a href="http://badoo.com/ru/">Badoo official website</a></b> <br><br>  - Read also: <br><br>  - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/intel/blog/106911/">Office of Intel</a> (in Nizhny Novgorod) <br>  - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/intel/blog/82533/">Office of Intel</a> (in Moscow) <br>  - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/office/130518/">Office Odnoklassniki</a> <br>  - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/office/124347/">Office of the company Vkontakte</a> <br>  - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/office/133358/">Office of the company Beeline</a> <br>  - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/office/135288/">ICQ office</a> <br>  - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/p/83155/">Data center "Oversan-Mercury"</a> <br>  - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/office/91646/">Boomburum office</a> <br><br>  All the best! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/151439/">https://habr.com/ru/post/151439/</a></p>
