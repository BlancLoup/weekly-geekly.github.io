Let us examine the sad question of why the trees are not as big as we remember them and what follows from this. <br><br>  Recently Lenya Boytsov <a href="http://webplanet.ru/column/law/itman/2006/10/31/togoogle.html">published a</a> good study about why Google forbids the word ‚Äúgoogle‚Äù.  I strongly advise a thoughtful reader to carefully read this text, because I‚Äôll now say that the substantive part of the question of how much Google has <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2006/10/do-you-google.html">attacked the masses of the people does not matter.</a> <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2006/10/do-you-google.html"><br></a>  <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2006/10/do-you-google.html">What matters is that the lobby of lawyers (definitely good - Google has enough resources to buy the best) won the lobby of not-be-evil PR managers (by definition, bad ones - either you sat with Brin in the same garage, or you were real and cynical hero of the book Buckley).</a>  <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2006/10/do-you-google.html">In a blog post it is directly written that for Google Corporation the costs of potential (that is, possible) loss of a trademark are more important than popular love (past, present and future).</a>  <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2006/10/do-you-google.html">In fact, it says that the Google company is morally ready to stop being a leader in the search, since it is not important for it anymore.</a>  <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2006/10/do-you-google.html">Moreover, it does not matter what kind of donbivil there.</a> <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2006/10/do-you-google.html"><br></a>  <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2006/10/do-you-google.html">Anyone who thinks of defeat is already a loser.</a> <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2006/10/do-you-google.html"><br></a>  <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2006/10/do-you-google.html">The one who is ready to surrender a position that seems to his strategically important to his opponents, and he is no longer just a good commander.</a> <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2006/10/do-you-google.html"><br><br></a>  <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2006/10/do-you-google.html">This text is placed on a resource where everyone knows the word Google.</a>  <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2006/10/do-you-google.html">Alas, many of the readers believe that the search on the Internet was invented by Sergey Brin and Larry Page.</a>  <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2006/10/do-you-google.html">Among those who know that this is not the case, there are at least hopeless people who think that a search on the web was done by Yahoo!</a> <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2006/10/do-you-google.html"><br></a>  <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2006/10/do-you-google.html">Anyway, most readers think that google.com is looking much better than ask.com or yahoo.com and that matters.</a> <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2006/10/do-you-google.html"><br></a>  <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2006/10/do-you-google.html">The simplest ‚Äúblind‚Äù test will show you that the difference is insignificant.</a>  <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2006/10/do-you-google.html">For 99% of users - invisible.</a> <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2006/10/do-you-google.html"><br></a>  <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2006/10/do-you-google.html">Reading</a> <a href="http://investor.google.com/">Google Investor Relations</a> can teach you that money is not in search, but in the world's best advertising sales system, speaking very roughly - in the largest banner selling network. <br>  This system is very dependent on the search, but on the search in general, and not any particular one.  If tomorrow the plane crashes with all the great engineers who do the search for google, then the problem will be very modest - for a short amount of time it will be necessary to license someone else's search.  Users will not notice (yes, and you personally, dear reader), and business will not suffer. <br>  Common sense would suggest that it is logical to love Sergey Brin if you are a girl who wants to marry a young, beautiful, intelligent and very rich.

      However, the modern system of disseminating information is the furthest from common sense.  The blogosphere is afraid to cut itself on Occam's razor and runs well away from it. <br><br>  No one except the participants in the transaction read the contract between the SUP and 6A.  If out of all the published information to throw out PR, it will become clear that no one owes anything to anyone. <br>  But this is not information and moreover, not a subject for conversation. <br>  It is easier to believe that the Spout in person during long winter evenings will clean your LiveJournal.  After that, it becomes quite obvious that the politicized SUP has <a href="http://www.echo.msk.ru/news/342172.html">pressed a button in California</a> . <br>  And even <a href="http://www.yoki.ru/social/society/04-11-2006/33226-Livejournal-0">at Rostelecom</a> .  This is logical_2.0, i.e.  It does not require you to think with your head or verify facts.  It is desirable, while not remembering anything. <br>  Better nothing at all. <br>  For example, without knowing anything about Runet 2000, it is <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/blog/iproducer/2243.html">very convenient to compare</a> Yandex. Bookmarks <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/blog/iproducer/2243.html">and del.icio.us.</a>  But if you know that from 2000 to 2004, Yandex.Bookmarks had a public (user) page and local search, checking with classifiers and much more, it becomes much more difficult to live with it all.  It will be necessary, in particular, to find out why the miraculous web-devol was absolutely not needed by anyone just three years ago, and now it is so fashionable. <br>  This is a hard question. <br>  Until ‚Äúa real underground habrahabr‚Äù happened, this question should be considered a homework. <br><br>  One friend of mine, good and smart, said that in the beta version of this text there is not enough climax explaining why I am writing all this.  On the one hand, it is impossible to explain why I am writing this.  On the other hand, there is a clean Web-two-zero all around: the world around us is not the same as we see it, and the events around us occur not because of why we think.  Or, on the contrary, everything is exactly as we think.  The event is what the TV reported, and the reasons correspond to our ideas about the laws of physics, and not the laws of physics at all.  I can only hope that I gave good examples. <br><br>  And we'll talk about life-giving tags a little later.  This conversation, by the way, should begin with the study of the principles of library classification. <br>  Since the problem is that the rubrication by tags is more complicated than the catalog one. <br>  So it goes. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4665/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4665/</a></p>
