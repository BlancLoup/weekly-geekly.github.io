  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Tubes for 9990 rubles - a divorce from "M.Video"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Last night I found out that M.Video sells an IPhone with a significant discount.  I looked at the site, indeed, 8 gigovy sell for 9990 rubles.  There was information that 16 gigovy give for 15,000. Familiar, fond of subjects, said that the action takes place until August 9.  Although the official information about the timing never found.  The site has only a card <a href="http://iphone.mvideo.ru/card.php%3Fid%3D30005318">Apple iPhone 3G 8Gb</a> <br><br>  I have never been particularly interested in the iPhone, but for 10,000 why not take it ... This morning I went to the nearest M.Video store in the Spektr shopping center on Teplyane Stan.  I came to the discovery and realized that in reality this whole action was <s>cheap,</s> expensive PR, with support on TV. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  First, the number of handsets in each store is very limited.  For example, in the Spectrum there were only five of them.  At the opening of the store (at 10 o'clock) there was already a line inside.  The first two people managed to buy themselves iPhones.  Employees of the store were sending accessories, hinting that this was a must when buying in stocks.  The people were about 30-40 people.  After the sale of two phones, they somehow ended up in the store.  Particularly active buyers began to find out the reasons ... On the computer monitor, we managed to see that in all this time 5 handsets were sold.  When asked where there are 3 more pieces and who could buy them, senior manager Andrey Andreev said directly that the store employees bought them (if I have two witnesses).  A strange queue, which arose before the discovery - it was also not clear where it came from.  The security of the shopping center did not allow anyone to enter the ground floor until the store opened.  It turns out that these are some familiar employees who have gone through the service entrance? <br><br>  He met people at the site who had contacts in the main office.  As a result of telephone conversations with several people, it became clear that there were no more iPhones in the warehouse.  Moreover, in some stores began to sell "coupons" for the IPhone.  Those.  you pay money, get a check, but the tube itself is not available ... You need to get it later (when it appears).  Since the tubes are delivered quite a bit every day, it can be understood that those 56 tubes, which by 10:30 in the morning sold "on credit" can just block the imports for several days.  In some stores today did not bring anything at all!

      I do not understand why, with such a minimum amount of goods, the management of the network advertises this action through the central television channels.  Yesterday saw a movie on NTV, channel 1.  I do not want to think that all this ‚Äúaction‚Äù is a simple PR move and the creation of information noise around M.Video, but apparently it is ... <br><br>  A lot of my friends have come across a similar situation.  Today, for the opening, a couple of handsets were sold and everything ... There is <a href="http://www.mvideo.ru/adv-txt/%3Fp%3Diphone-buy">active PR</a> on the site, it is said that there are still iPhones in several Russian cities ... It's funny :) <br><br>  And what do you know about it?  Maybe it is worth somewhere to report about this action and the situation around it?  Around this in Moscow there was a decent rush.  According to information from the office, all employees deal only with iPhones ... Both the buyers and the sellers themselves are nervous. <br><br>  <b>UPD: it turns out, by order of the superiors of the chain of stores M-Video, sellers must sell no more than a certain number of handsets per day.</b>  <b>Such a disposition, and even taking into account the possible "leakage" of the tubes by the sellers themselves and their friends, creates an artificial shortage and, as a result, an increased agiotage.</b> <br><br><h4>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/iphone/66380/">Continuation of a story</a> </h4></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/66283/">https://habr.com/ru/post/66283/</a></p>
