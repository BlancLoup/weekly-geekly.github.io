  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Government procurement and open source software - lessons from tenders of the Ministry of Communications, part 2</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Those who followed the competition publications of the Ministry of Communications and Mass Media, already know that IT Co. won the five-million <a href="http://www.zakupki.gov.ru/Tender/ViewPurchase.aspx%3FPurchaseId%3D544120">contest for the development and implementation of an electronic document management system based on open source software</a> with a bid of 30,000 rubles.  The results of the competition and the business qualities of its participants were vividly discussed at Habr√© in the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/open_source/76787/">first part of the Marlezonsky ballet</a> . <br><br>  A couple of weeks after this fabulous event, a fatter <a href="http://www.zakupki.gov.ru/Tender/ViewPurchase.aspx%3FPurchaseId%3D563865">competition of the Ministry of Communications</a> and Mass Media was <a href="http://www.zakupki.gov.ru/Tender/ViewPurchase.aspx%3FPurchaseId%3D563865">held</a> , one of the lots of which is related to open source software and - a surprise!  surprise!  - to electronic document flow.  This time, the ministry decided to find a contractor to perform work with the beautiful name ‚ÄúDevelopment of system and technological solutions for creating an electronic document management system based on free software.‚Äù  The ministry was ready to allocate 14 million rubles for such research work. <br><br>  Having dispersed a bit of d√©j√† vu and convinced myself that the similarity of the competitions is purely apparent, and that it is very logical to order the development and implementation of the system first, and only then the research on the same topic, we proceed to study the tender documentation. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In the technical assignment, everything is serious, just look at the short list of works:

      1.1.  "Justification of functional requirements for the system of VEDO." <br>  Within this type of work it is necessary: <br>  An analysis of existing regulatory and legal acts and organizational and technical documents governing the operation of the system of VEDO; <br>  Analysis of domestic and international experience in the organization of electronic document management systems of state authorities (hereinafter referred to as OGV); <br>  Development of recommendations on the minimum required list of information services of the EEA system; <br>  Development of functional requirements for the EEA system, taking into account the interaction of civil servants with internal and interdepartmental participants in the processes of the state bodies. <br><br>  1.2 "Justification of technical requirements for the system of EEA on the basis of open source software". <br>  Within this type of work it is necessary: <br>  Analysis of existing decisions on the organization of electronic document management systems of state bodies based on world and domestic experience, including using solutions based on open source software; <br>  The study of world and domestic experience in the use of open document standards in government documents; <br>  Development of technical requirements for the system VEDO based on open source software; <br>  Development of technical requirements for a typical automated workplace of a public servant (hereinafter - ARM GS) on the basis of open source software; <br>  Development of technical requirements for network system services to ensure the operation of the system VEDO; <br>  Development of technical requirements for the message conversion system of the MEDO system into the VEDO system (hereinafter - the adapter). <br><br>  1.3 "Development of recommendations on technical solutions for the creation of a system of VEDO based on open source software and the organization of the interaction of the system of VEDO with the MEDO system." <br>  Within this type of work it is necessary: <br>  Development of a methodology for selecting solutions based on open source software for use in creating an EEA system; <br>  Analysis of possible options for the creation of a system of VEDO and development of recommendations on the choice of basic software platforms for its creation on the basis of open source software; <br>  Development of proposals for the organization of electronic interaction between the systems of MEDO and VEDO; <br>  Economic analysis of the creation of a system of VEDO based on open source software; <br>  Development of a methodology for the implementation and maintenance of an EEA system based on open source software; <br>  Development of draft regulations and organizational and technical documents regulating the operation of the system of VEDO. <br><br>  1.4 "Development of experimental samples of the basic components of the EEA system based on open source software". <br>  Within this type of work it is necessary: <br>  Development of an experimental sample of a typical automated workplace; <br>  Development of an experimental sample of network system services required for the operation of the VEDO; <br>  Development of an experimental sample adapter for converting messages from MEDO systems to the system VEDO. <br><br>  Among the applicants we see all familiar faces: <br><br>  1C with a bid of 9 million <br>  Lanit - 9 million <br>  Aichi - 9,800 million <br><br>  and from relatively new Helios Computers (the structure of Armada, in fact), ready to study everything for 6.800 million, and Intellands, agreeing to even a million. <br><br>  After in the first part of the Marlezonsky ballet, the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/open_source/76787/">performers urged the audience</a> to establish 700 workstations of the electronic document management system for 30 sput - not Bin Newton, the results of the second competition of the Ministry of Communications and Mass Communications surprise me less.  Maybe you think that the ministry again did not save money for taxpayers and bought a million million rubles of research and development instead of the allocated budget 14?  Not!  Money is bullshit, which is really priceless - this is the time.  And in this competition, the ministry, together with the winning IT Co., decided to do the impossible.  The Ministry has set a deadline for the execution of the competition on December 25, the results of which were published on December 3.  And IT Co. is ready to do all the above work, including the development of layouts, in 4 days.  No, as well as about 30 sput, you heard right - in FOUR days.  Here are the copy-pastes from the IT application: <br>  one <br>  Justification of functional requirements for the system of VEDO. <br>  From the date of conclusion of the state contract 1 (one) working day <br>  2 <br>  Justification of technical requirements for the system of VEDO based on open source software. <br>  From the date of conclusion of the state contract 1 (one) working day <br>  3 <br>  Development of recommendations on technical solutions for the creation of an EEA system based on open source software and the organization of the interaction of the EEA system with MEDO systems <br>  From the date of conclusion of the state contract 1 (one) working day <br>  four <br>  Development of experimental samples of basic components of an EEA system based on open source software <br>  From the date of the conclusion of the state contract 1 (one) working day. <br><br>  Learn to work, gentlemen.  For such work, and ten lemons do not mind. <br>  UPD How correctly corrected here, IT Co. proposes to do all the research work not even in four, but in ONE day. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/77846/">https://habr.com/ru/post/77846/</a></p>
