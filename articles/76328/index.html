Thinking yourself naturally good.  In fact this is not true. <br>  The customer and the Contractor are, rather, Jedi and Sith, "white" and "red", yin and yang.  They are unthinkable without each other and can never "win" a partner. <br><br>  Customer-Executor interaction has several key points, the uncertainty in which leads, as a rule, to conflicts and damage to the project.  Let's try to label them. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  1) General ideas about the expected outcome of the project <br><br>  The reason number 2 (about the first - later) of all disagreements "writer and bookseller" is the difference in that.  what is expected by the end of the project.  The roots of this evil lie in the first meeting with the performer and his fantastically excellent commercial offer.  There, as a rule, all the best that the studio did and the maximum of what it has to offer is described.  Or rather, not even the maximum, but the ideal to which she aspires.  On the other hand.  in the head of the customer there is an ideal that he saw on the bourgeois Internet and considers it applicable to his tasks.  And they ALWAYS do not match.  But in reality, the studio will do even less because of the budget framework that hinders the creative flight.

      2) The degree of customer intervention in the development <br>  This is the key moment of the project.  The performer hates the customer for being sloppy.  The stained main business climbs into the tender interior of the project.  And this is despite the fact that the customer, in fact, is just a tool, financial injections allowing the creator to realize his potential. <br>  The customer hates the performer for taking money, shoving it into a black box from which something will come out that remotely resembles a project.  Damn, I want to control the whole process and make my edits for every developer. <br><br>  3) Terms and results <br>  Deadlines are always broken.  Planned result can not be achieved at 100%.  The developer believes that this is due to unrealistically long approvals and stupid customer intervention in the process.  The customer considers.  What is it because of the laziness and unlimitedness of developers and their unwillingness to understand the task.  This can not be avoided.  It is inevitable.  It'll be this way forever. <br><br>  4) Personal interaction of managers <br>  Personal interaction of representatives of the customer and the performer is the key to failure.  Of course.  There are excellent, highly competent customers with a delicate, sensitive attitude to development.  There are also responsible, organized, meeting all deadlines and other arrangements performers.  But only in dreams, dreams, dreams ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/76328/">https://habr.com/ru/post/76328/</a></p>
