Not far off on June 12, which means that we are waiting for the long weekend again.  As in May, many Russians will fly away on a short vacation to rest from the hustle and bustle.  Therefore, on the eve of the June holidays, we decided to touch on an interesting and applied topic - how to save money using a <a href="https://hidemy.name/ru/vpn/">VPN</a> . <br><br>  The simplest thing is <b>saving on car rent.</b> <br><br>  Example: booking a car in Brisbane (Australia), first using a Swiss IP: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f0c/e85/54b/f0ce8554b4653839c0b64cb3a9db87ee.png">

      Now we change the IP address to the USA and try again: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/472/447/855/4724478556831f41721f99a2e2559c05.png"><br>  Saved $ 9 per day.  Imagine that you are traveling to travel in Australia for 2 weeks.  Accordingly, you will save $ 126, which is very good.  Car rental services offer different prices and offers depending on the country.  If you try to book a car, say, from the USA, Russia and Bangkok, the prices will be different. <br><br>  Let us consider in more detail and other examples: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Air ticket purchase</b> <br><br>  Example: buy a ticket from Moscow to Los Angeles using Indian IP. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4c8/d23/6a2/4c8d236a23da1bd80abac1c6ef71be9c.png"><br><br>  And now we change the IP to shtatovskiy and buy a ticket in the same direction. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/856/b5c/3a6/856b5c3a62c990c09b972eb5259425ae.png"><br><br>  Yes, the airline has changed, but before such an offer was not at all!  The ‚Äúcheapest‚Äù offer in the issue has changed (it has become $ 48 cheaper), and the ‚Äúoptimal‚Äù offer has become $ 61 more expensive.  For the difference, you can already bring New Balance sneakers or a brand new iPod Shuffle from the states. <br><br>  Many airlines and aggregators customize user data - the price of a ticket depends on the brand of the device from which you are searching, on the host country, city and region, on the number of requests, etc.  Flower shops do just the same, and who only ‚Äúnot‚Äù: on this topic, somehow, there was already a serious <a href="https://vc.ru/p/florist-prices">holivar on VC</a> . <br><br>  For example, if you use an expensive MacBook, the price will be higher, and if at the same time you live in a prestigious area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city, you can safely throw it over the top.  The cost of the same product found through the phone will be different from that found through the desktop computer.  History repeats with the number of requests.  The more often you check the price, the higher the price will be. <br><br>  Airlines play on people's fears - a person who endlessly updates the page with offers of aggregators and sees that the price increases, believes that this happens for objective reasons (for example, because tickets run out quickly and there is high demand for them).  And in the end, he buys a ticket at a very high price. <br><br>  However, using VPN, you can beat marketers with their own weapons and make the purchase cheaper. <br><br>  The algorithm is simple: <br><br><ol><li>  Clear cookies, or open the site in the incognito mode of your browser <br></li><li>  <a href="https://hidemy.name/ru/vpn/">Turn on VPN</a> and change IP address <br></li></ol><br>  <b>Different issue on hotel reservation services</b> <br><br>  Absolutely the same story happens with hotels.  For tourists from different countries, the cost of rooms and the issuance of offers will be different.  The algorithm of action is the same as with air tickets. <br><br>  Example of booking: Prague, June 13-15, 1 adult, Indian IP. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5ed/63c/4a8/5ed63c4a8429ae4a1973d466db9cd503.png"><br><br>  Change IP to Iceland.  Absolutely other hotels in the first issue for a higher price. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/692/851/b19/692851b19700a69050ad701622554d81.png"><br><br>  Those hotels that are shown at a discount of 19% in Iceland, in India already receive all 39% of the "discount".  Nominally: in fact, the price differs by 17 rubles.  Here, for example, Hotel Residence Bologna, if you go to the site with the Indian IP: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/956/ab4/b7a/956ab4b7a7f2899715546c3e5d8f1e1c.png"><br><br>  <b>Saving on Apple services</b> <br><br>  It‚Äôs no secret that iTunes‚Äôs pricing matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãquite large and has many indicators, which also depend on the country.  In ‚Äúexpensive‚Äù countries, prices for apps and music are usually higher.  Therefore, before buying an album in your own Apple Music or iTunes, you should compare its value with other regions. <br><br>  Let's take a look at how to buy the essentials in American iTunes. <br><br>  The algorithm is somewhat more complicated than in the previous paragraphs: <br><br><ol><li>  First you need to log out of your Apple ID <br></li><li>  Check that you have a US IP address <br></li><li>  Find the free app in the iTunes AppStore and download it.  Above all, remember that you need to download the application, not music or video.  iTunes will ask for your Apple ID - just create a new one. <br></li><li>  Accept the agreement and complete the login process. <br></li><li>  Find you need a paid app or music.  When the payment screen appears, do not enter credit card details.  Use the postal <a href="https://www.usps.com/">service</a> and find any address in Delaware (Delaware) to avoid sales tax. <br></li><li>  For payment, use the gift card American iTunes.  You can purchase it through eBay or Amazon.  Or you can buy a virtual US credit card.  There are a lot of services selling them. <br></li></ol><br>  <b>Amazon Savings</b> <br><br>  Like in iTunes, Amazon‚Äôs pricing is quite complex.  It happens that the same product, depending on the region of delivery, costs differently.  But changing a location using a VPN is a breeze. <br><br>  Let's give an example on the purchase of books.  On <a href="http://www.cheapriver.com/">cheapriver.com</a> you can compare prices for the same book in different countries.  The algorithm here is very simple: <br><br><ol><li>  With the help of the website cheapriver.com find the book you are interested in and see prices in different regions: </li></ol><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a9b/f76/3c7/a9bf763c7d8ce2682f18d83a87bd5002.png"><br><br><ol><li>  Create a local account on Amazon (again, this will require a local IP address) <br></li><li>  And voila!  Buy the book you need. <br></li></ol><br>  <b>Savings on the purchase of software</b> <br><br>  <i>Disclaimer: the information in this article is by no means a guide to action.</i>  <i>Do not repeat this at home, in the office and even in Gorky Park.</i>  <i>To love and pay "Google tax" is the law.</i> <br>  When you visit Microsoft or Adobe websites, you are automatically shown the cost of products in your country, because  Sites use your IP to access your location.  In different regions, the price may vary very well.  You can find out the price in different countries using VPN. <br><br>  Example: We buy Adobe Photoshop from Russia: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/30a/7cd/79e/30a7cd79e3f3e2f28c86bfd379b0cb87.png"><br><br>  This is the cost that you will see after the calculation of the Russian VAT and all commissions.  Change the IP address to Australia.  We check, again - including all taxes and local analogue of VAT: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/778/f1e/131/778f1e1319b325a4e9e61bb29e4771eb.png"><br><br>  For understanding, 25.29 Australian dollars is about 1063 rubles. <br><br><blockquote>  When you buy Adobe Photoshop in Australia, and not in Russia, you will save about 450 rubles per month.  <b>Or 5,400 rubles a year</b> - for which you can already go to St. Petersburg or dine for two in an excellent restaurant </blockquote><br>  <b>Total:</b> <br><br>  The change of location leads to a change in prices in a number of segments: when buying games ( <i>and in our <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/hidemy_name/blog/288636/">previous article</a> we also talked about differences in prices for games on Steam depending on your IP address</i> ) books, clothes, air tickets, hotel reservations and much more .  Often this is due to the characteristics ( <i>not the most bona fide</i> ) of marketing, sometimes because of the peculiarities of local legislation or taxation.  It is also important to remember that some services need to be paid with credit or gift cards of those countries whose IP was used for the purchase. <br><br>  If you are keen to try VPN in business and see how it all works ( <i>and this is very simple</i> ), then you can <a href="https://hidemy.name/ru/demo/">request a test day</a> right now at HideMy.name.  Try and enjoy anonymous and free internet! <br><br>  And you yourself faced with situations where prices for the same goods differed when visiting sites from different browsers, countries or devices? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/404017/">https://habr.com/ru/post/404017/</a></p>
