Microsoft is also slowly approaching them, but what about the rest?  What is the role, for example, of RIM?  A month ago, the Canadian company introduced three new devices on the ‚Äúfresh‚Äù BlackBerry OS 7: Bold 9900, Torch 9810 and 9860. For your attention, both video and text review. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Review removed, mounted and voiced by rozetked <a href="http://rozetked.ru/">tehnoblog</a> and <a href="http://blackberries.ru/">blackberries.ru</a> portal

      The share of BlackBerry, mainly for the RIM American market, fell in the 4th year from 50% to 15%, despite the fact that in the world the share of the Canadian company grew from 9.6% to just over 12%.  Recently, the guys from RIM announced and released three new devices, which, according to the company itself, should improve their situation. <br><br>  The first of these devices is the BlackBerry Torch 8910. The phone came to replace the old "torch" - 9800. Outwardly, both devices are the same, but the "pieces of iron" are different.  The novelty has a dual-core processor with a frequency of 1 GHz, a display with a resolution of 600x480 and a camera with the ability to record HD video, face detection and image stabilization.  But the most important feature - BlackBerry OS 7. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/78c5e4f9/a326f319/59ca353d/f1c8df39.jpeg"><br><br>  What is remarkable about the new OS?  First, it is an updated user interface, improved browser, simplified management for communication services and programs.  In addition, the OS has support for voice search.  At one time, the BlackBerry OS has become even better for business decisions and has ‚Äúlooked prettier‚Äù in appearance.  BlackBerry 7, coupled with powerful "glands" gives unprecedented results, the device works very quickly.  It‚Äôs worth praising BlackBerry engineers and programmers. <br><br>  Probably the most popular model from the new BlackBerry 7-series is the Bold 9900. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/75e88577/664e7300/3d6bc8da/f1bd0e41.jpg"><br><br>  The body of the device is made of plastic and metal with a real carbon insert on the back of the device. <br><br>  It is worth emphasizing the fact that RIM itself defines the Bold 9900 as the most powerful smartphone ever created by them, although it does not differ from the 9810 and 9860 models.  The updated Bold has a 2.8 inch touchscreen display with a resolution of 640x480.  This, by the way, 287 pixels per inch - almost Retina. <br><br>  The combination of touch screen and touch joystick.  It is this ‚Äúbun‚Äù that makes it possible to feel complete comfort when using the Internet.  I never thought that the trackball is convenient, but it really is ... <br><br>  Bold 9900 - the perfect device for business.  The price, of course, is not small (around 30 thousand rubles), but I will say straight out - the device is worth it.  The quality of materials, and especially carbon, plus BlackBerry OS 7 make this device a weapon for the business environment.  Of course, you should not forget about the company's services, such as BBM and BlackBerry Balance (a new application in OS 7 that helps the user to separate the working content from the personal one.) <br><br>  The third device - BlackBerry Torch 9860, it is a full-featured touch-smartphone.  The diagonal of the phone screen is 3.7 inches with a resolution of 800x480 pixels.  In the history of BlackBerry - this is the largest display. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/a832b5e9/e3a722a5/a5933ab1/5eef9bac.jpg"><br><br>  A rather large screen and a powerful graphics chip make a new console with a wide range of multimedia features.  Such a device will be interesting to people of any age.  But in fact, it doesn't seem to me that this device is not exactly what the BlackBerry needs - without a keyboard, the sensations are a bit different ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/0c6bed1b/ac759243/91c957a2/01468f6e.jpg"><br><br>  So far, RIM has not provided any data regarding the sale of smartphones, but going over the western portals, I was able to see the love of dedicated fans and new faces that want to buy BlackBerry.  Someone is tired of Androids and iPhones.  The choice, of course, is yours, but, frankly, RIM have taken a huge step forward! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/129411/">https://habr.com/ru/post/129411/</a></p>
