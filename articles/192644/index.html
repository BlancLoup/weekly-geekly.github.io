As a result, the application received more than 100 new features and a redesigned interface. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://evernote.com/download/get.php%3Ffile%3DWin5Beta">Download Evernote 5 for Windows</a></strong> <br>  <em>Automatic update of the application will occur next week.</em> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  New look </h3><br>  Over the years that have passed since the first launch of Evernote for Windows, a lot has changed in the design world of applications.  In Evernote 5, we used a modern aesthetic approach to creating an interface that would seamlessly look on all versions of Windows.  Having got rid of redundant elements, we simplified the process of viewing and creating notes.

    <h3>  Quick work </h3><br>  Simple and clear appearance - not the only aspect that allows you to work faster with Evernote.  We also added new features that will help you quickly move to the right materials. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d78/046/bf1/d78046bf1081b1514d3c4166f2800e8a.png"><br><br>  <strong>Shortcuts</strong> <br>  At the top of the left pane is the shortcut area.  They allow you to get quick access to frequently used items.  Just drag a note, notebook (personal or Evernote Business) or tags to this area.  Shortcuts are great for conveniently navigating to notes on a regular meeting agenda, large work or personal projects, trip planning, etc. There is no need to search or scroll through a list of notes every time you look for a record. <br><br>  <strong>Improved note management</strong> <br>  Under the labels you will see sections of notes, notebooks and tags.  Select the desired one, click on it, and the right panel will switch to the corresponding view mode.  It seems to us that such a mapping allows you to better focus on the current task.  However, if you prefer to see the full list of notebooks or notes in the left pane, you can simply right-click and open them using the appropriate menu item. <br><br>  Our Evernote Business users will also be able to switch between viewing personal and corporate notebooks and tags, and also quickly create business notebooks from personal ones. <br><br><h3>  Reminders </h3><br>  Reminders are just three functions combined into one.  By clicking on the alarm clock icon, you will add the selected entry to the list of reminders at the top of the list of notes.  Notes in this list of reminders can be moved, thereby setting the desired priority.  And, of course, you can add the date and time of the reminders to be sure that the <a href="http://blog.evernote.com/ru/2013/09/04/how-to-never-miss-a-deadline/">tasks</a> contained in the notes <a href="http://blog.evernote.com/ru/2013/09/04/how-to-never-miss-a-deadline/">will be completed on time</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a6/3d0/63e/3a63d063ef1b3ccd47ee62bd9c236eb2.png"><br><br>  Reminders are well suited for personal and team projects.  When you share a notebook with friends and colleagues, they can subscribe to reminders in this notebook.  In this case, they will receive notifications about the approaching deadlines for completing tasks in a particular note. <br><br><h3>  Improved notes </h3><br>  One of the biggest changes you'll notice in Evernote 5 is the approach to displaying notes in the list.  By clicking on the notes section in the left panel, you will see in the one list all the notes to which you have access.  This includes not only the notes you create, but also those contained in personal and business notebooks to which you have been given access.  The advantage of this approach is to have everything you need without extra steps.  If you wish, you can sort the notes or filter those stored in shared notebooks. <br><br>  <b>Card mode view</b> <br>  The new card view mode displays notes in the form of square cards that give a visual representation of the contents of the records when viewing the list, especially if there are images in the notes.  You can switch between different viewing modes using the drop-down list in the upper left corner of the notes panel. <br><br>  <strong>Framing notes</strong> <br>  The revised markup editor now encircles the note with a frame to better emphasize the information contained in it.  For short notes, the frame is located directly below the content so that you can clearly see where the recording ends.  Double clicking on a note in the list will open it in a separate window for easier reading and editing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f36/ad6/af2/f36ad6af243a0e4501691a1efb4ac87e.png"><br><br>  <strong>Premium feature: related notes</strong> <br>  We have assembled a separate team in order to make notes smarter.  Premium feature similar notes - one of the projects of this team.  When you start typing in a note or simply browsing it, Evernote examines your account and notes in shared notebooks for records that might be similar or related to the current note.  As soon as Evernote finds something, the result appears below the note.  With similar notes, you don‚Äôt have to spend time on re-work that you or someone on your team may have already completed a couple of years ago. <br><br><h3>  Smarter search </h3><br>  Another major innovation in Evernote 5 is the improved search function. <br><ul><li>  Search tips: as you type a query Evernote offers possible options based on the notes in your account. </li><li>  Search in shared notebooks: you have the opportunity to search for notebooks to which you have been granted access. </li><li>  Shortcuts for saved queries: you can add a saved search query to the shortcut bar. </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/def/705/7ec/def7057ec344b43c0f0f49aa07869846.png"><br><br><h3>  Notes on the map </h3><br>  When you use Evernote on your phone, tablet or some computers, the application adds location information to the notes you create.  Using the Atlas view, you will see these notes on a world map. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://evernote.com/download/get.php%3Ffile%3DWin5Beta">Download Evernote 5 for Windows</a></strong> <br>  <em>Automatic update of the application will occur next week.</em> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/192644/">https://habr.com/ru/post/192644/</a></p>
