      So, you went on your first date, and then ... nothing.  Do you call the next day to say that you had fun?  Are you waiting three days?  Should you worry if you do not want to get involved?  Everyone asks these questions when they meet, and no one loves them.  It is much better to know for sure whether another person wants to see each other again. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Your developer wants the same thing, and yet the statistics on communication is ludicrous: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://www.tlnt.com/survey-half-of-all-job-applicants-say-they-never-got-a-response-back/">50% of</a> candidates do not receive a response after submitting an application, even acknowledging that it was received. </li><li>  The lack of a personal response within 24 hours reduces the likelihood that applicants will remain active candidates by <a href="https://resources.workpop.com/what-keeps-top-candidates-from-applying-to-your-job-posts">28%</a> . </li><li>  <a href="http://www.careerarc.com/blog/2016/06/candidate-experience-study-infographic/">65% of</a> candidates say that they never or rarely receive notification of the decision taken on their application from the employer. </li><li>  Of those who receive a notification, <a href="http://www.careerarc.com/blog/2016/06/candidate-experience-study-infographic/">51%</a> say it takes 1 month or more. </li><li>  When they do not receive a response from employers, <a href="http://www.careerarc.com/blog/2016/06/candidate-experience-study-infographic/">85% of</a> job seekers doubt that their application has been reviewed. </li></ul><br>  It is important to maintain <a href="https://www.stackoverflowbusiness.com/blog/4-elements-of-a-great-candidate-experience-for-developers">constant communication</a> with candidates, even if you do not have changes.  Here is a <a href="https://resources.workpop.com/candidate-experience-whitepaper%3FhsCtaTracking%3Dc1c8ed44-e1fe-4faa-8704-282e34f1aa2d%257Ccfb5a8e9-2f24-4228-8b5f-5b96dffd7af0">minimal list of events</a> when something needs to be sent: <br><br><ul><li>  Application received </li><li>  Application rejected </li><li>  Interview scheduled </li><li>  After interview / technical interview </li><li>  Offer </li></ul><br>  Better yet, lay out all your cards on this table.  <a href="https://resources.careerbuilder.com/guides/candidate-experience-guide">83% of candidates</a> stated that this would significantly improve their ‚Äúcandidate‚Äôs experience‚Äù if employers provided clear deadlines for the interview.  If you have planned the interview process correctly, you should have no problem telling the candidates what to expect.  This will help them understand the process and your decision. <br><br>  All messages must be delivered in a timely manner, and some of them, for example, receipt of an application, can be automated.  This is an easy way to leave a developer with a good impression of your company.  In fact, candidates believe that timely tracking of application status is <a href="http://www.careerarc.com/blog/2016/06/candidate-experience-study-infographic/">more important</a> than a well thought out career site. <br><br>  And this is also true for candidates who have been rejected, apparently, this is the majority of people going through the process.  In the end, these developers may be well suited to work in the future, but you can spoil the relationship, because candidates who are not informed about the status of the application are <a href="http://www.careerarc.com/blog/2016/06/candidate-experience-study-infographic/">3.5 times less likely to contact</a> such a company again.  Be transparent at every stage of the process and inform all your candidates punctually and honestly. <br><br>  Here is an example of an invitation to an interview.  It is informative, without unnecessary information and tells the developer everything that is needed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qv/gq/y7/qvgqy7szzpa3uoopnczgku7r63a.png"><br><br>  <b>Source</b> : <a href="https://resources.workable.com/tutorial/invite-candidate-interview">Workable</a> <br><blockquote>  Transfer: <br><br>  <i>Topic: Invitation to an Acme Interview</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Hello, Dinah.</i>  <i>Thank you for contacting Acme.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Your application for the position of junior developer was interesting to us, and we would like to invite you for an interview in our office.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>You will meet with the head of our engineering department, Miss Blake, and two members of her team.</i>  <i>The interview will last about 60 minutes.</i>  <i>You will have the opportunity to discuss responsibilities and learn more about our company.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>We would like to conduct an interview this week.</i>  <i>Please let me know which of the following time intervals you would prefer.</i>  <i>I will send you an invitation in the calendar as soon as I receive your reply.</i> <i><br><br></i> <ul><li>  Monday 3/3, 5:30 pm </li><li>  Wednesday 3/4, 10:30 am </li><li>  Wednesday 3/4, 5:30 pm </li></ul><br>  If none of these time slots are right for you, let me know. <br>  Our offices are located at: 234 Road St.  You can find an attached screenshot of our exact location.  Please bring your ID so you can get a pass at the front desk.  Ask Mr. Edwards, our office manager, as soon as you arrive. <br><br>  Looking forward to your reply. </blockquote>  <b>Interview worth showing</b> <br><br>  Who among those present here didn‚Äôt have the slightest apprehension about meeting your partner‚Äôs parents for dinner for the first time?  Even if everything ends very well, there is always the fear that you will be cold judged for three meals and drinks. <br><br>  The job interview stage is no different from what <a href="http://business.stackoverflow.com/c/offer-global-developer-hiring-landscape-2016%3F__hstc%3D32395489.20309697e28dae192620185d3aa8e55f.1509705740022.1511444216141.1512397263141.8%26__hssc%3D32395489.11.1512397263141%26__hsfp%3D66214791">17% of developers</a> say that the job interview process is one of the most annoying parts of the job.  Even if you like a candidate, <a href="https://resources.workpop.com/what-keeps-top-candidates-from-applying-to-your-job-posts">65%</a> will lose interest in work if they have had a bad experience.  And the most difficult thing is that it depends on you so that the candidate does not feel this way: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ua/mj/8v/uamj8v_wv35dsqpc2xgv3n-tbbi.png"><br><br>  <b>Source</b> : <a href="https://twitter.com/missnoidea/status/933288528745848832">Twitter</a> <br><blockquote>  Transfer: <br><br>  <i>It was during the interview, the person I spoke to did not sound very good, and I was stupid and forgot to say my last name, but then everything went well, but I still cry, I'm afraid that I‚Äôll fail, and will scream and then I will cry in public.</i> </blockquote>  And also: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/s1/ib/fg/s1ibfgodotx_a4m0tm4ohtjwyww.png"><br><br>  <b>Source</b> : <a href="https://twitter.com/KerbyAirRide/status/938569725973590016">Twitter</a> <br><br><blockquote>  Transfer: <br><br>  <i>Confident completion of the interview should be one of the best and most relieving feelings.</i> </blockquote>  As in every step of the process, transparency and informing your candidate will work in your favor and in their favor.  In fact, <a href="https://www.stackoverflowbusiness.com/blog/why-giving-tech-candidates-an-interview-agenda-is-worth-your-time">35% of developers</a> said they wanted to be better prepared for the interview, and yet <a href="https://www.stackoverflowbusiness.com/blog/why-giving-tech-candidates-an-interview-agenda-is-worth-your-time">40% of applicants</a> do not receive anything other than time, date and place.  It's simple enough, so why not help them? <br><br>  You will still need to objectively evaluate your candidates, but give them all the information you need to move forward.  The best way to do this is to send them a <a href="https://www.stackoverflowbusiness.com/blog/4-elements-of-a-great-candidate-experience-for-developers">guide</a> before the interview, containing such information as: <br><br><ul><li>  Time </li><li>  date </li><li>  Directions </li><li>  List of interviewers with their posts </li><li>  Expectations </li><li>  Potential appointments </li><li>  <a href="https://www.ihire.com/employer/resources/pages/6-ways-to-provide-a-great-candidate-experience">Feedback from other employees</a> <br>  Examples <a href="https://www.ihire.com/employer/resources/pages/6-ways-to-provide-a-great-candidate-experience">of career paths</a> </li></ul><br>  <b>Technical Interview</b> <b><br></b> <br>  As a rule, candidates for a developer need to go through several rounds of technical interviews to check whether they have the right skills to work.  Although this is an inevitable evil, it is important, on the one hand, to be effective, and on the other, to reinforce the fact that you are a serious company that understands the technology you are interviewing. <br><br>  A great way for the first round is to give a task using technologies that developers will use if they get a job.  This task can be sent to a large number of candidates in order to reduce the group that you invite for an interview.  Candidates will appreciate it because it gives them an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat work they will do if they are accepted.  In addition, it will save expensive technical interviewers, since you can easily weed out anyone who does not meet the required technical skills threshold before inviting them for an interview. <br><br>  <b>How to avoid interview failure</b> <br><br>  At the interview, it is important to begin acquaintance with the candidate and assess his suitability for work.  Patrick McCuller in his book <a href="https://books.google.pl/books%3Fid%3DSdP-ofddMdgC%26pg%3DPA109%26lpg%3DPA109%26dq%3Dsoftware%2Bdevelopment%2Bcandidate%2Bexperience%26source%3Dbl%26ots%3D35Q3VeqmIk%26sig%3DjDITTHuivgVlKTlDu6_BdrvKItc%26hl%3Den%26sa%3DX%26ved%3D0ahUKEwi8trea94HYAhUOKewKHb58CRg4FBDoAQgsMAE">How to Recruit and Hire Great Software Engineers: Building a Crack Developmen</a> t (‚ÄúHow to find and hire great software engineers: creating a development team‚Äù) describes what you shouldn‚Äôt do at the interview for a good experience. candidate  He talks about the interview process, which included: <br><br><ul><li>  Change the time of the interview at the last minute. </li><li>  Interviewers who are late. </li><li>  A large number of puzzles that had nothing to do with the work or assessment of the candidate‚Äôs skills and only allowed the interviewer to feel smart. </li><li>  The interviewer who asked questions about work other than the one that was supposed to have an interview. </li><li>  Lack of communication from the recruiter. </li></ul><br>  This experience showed that the company in which he interviewed did not know what he was doing, and made him warn his acquaintances against working there.  On the contrary, if you are serious about the hiring process, testing developers on tasks similar to those they will actually work on, they will have a good impression of your company.  One of the biggest problems you can get into in this regard is the interview on the board.  This is popular in many companies, but candidates hate it because they do not feel that their abilities can be accurately evaluated in this way.  Comments like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0x/fn/v8/0xfnv85qfza3rk-kpbvz0mmyk_w.png"><br><br>  <b>Source</b> : <a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/why-is-hiring-broken-it-starts-at-the-whiteboard-34b088e5a5db">Sara Mei via freeCodeCamp</a> <br><blockquote>  Transfer: <br><br>  <i>Sarah Mei sarahmei ‚Ä¢ 19 Mar 2015</i> <i><br></i>  <i>There are whole books full of strategies for interviews on the board.</i>  <i>They provide sample questions that you will be asked and examples of solutions.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Sarah Mei sarahmei, 19 Mar 2015</i> <i><br></i>  <i>These books are intended for developers, and they exist because solving problems on the board is a completely different skill, different from the actual development.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Sarah Mei @sarahmei ‚Ä¢ 19 Mar 2015</i> <i><br></i>  <i>I am a mentor of students in several programming camps.</i>  <i>Each school teaches ‚Äúblackboard skills‚Äù as a separate subject.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Sarah Mei sarahmei, 19 Mar 2015</i> <i><br></i>  <i>They teach this separately, because solving problems on the board is a completely different skill, different from the actual development.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Sarah mei sarahmei</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Why do we continue to conduct interviews on the board, although they tell us little about how good a candidate is in actual software development?</i> </blockquote>  and this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ma/d8/nu/mad8nu6xljjoryahkrwpgna9aiw.png"><br><br>  <b>Source</b> : <a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/why-is-hiring-broken-it-starts-at-the-whiteboard-34b088e5a5db">Max Howell via freeCodeCamp</a> <br><blockquote>  Transfer: <br><br>  <i>Google: 90% of our engineers use the software you wrote (Homebrew), but you cannot invert the binary tree on the board, so ***.</i> </blockquote>  are commonplace.  Not only do bad methods, such as interviews on the blackboard, give you incomplete information, they give candidates the impression that your company does not know what they are talking about.  Instead, use collaborative programming interviews or ‚Äúfirst day at work‚Äù tests, as they better assess the capabilities of the developer and give them confidence in your competence as a company. <br><br>  Other things you can do are be <a href="https://www.stackoverflowbusiness.com/blog/how-to-create-an-incredible-candidate-experience-on-a-limited-budget">punctual</a> , sociable and listen more than talk.  Another positive step you can take is to introduce developers to the team they will be working in - a practice that <a href="https://www.stackoverflowbusiness.com/blog/why-giving-tech-candidates-an-interview-agenda-is-worth-your-time">47% of developers</a> want during an interview.  In the end, you should not hide anything, including your team. <br><br>  <b>Always ask for feedback</b> <br><br>  After the first date, wouldn't you ask how you looked?  Were you right in trying to be funny or should you be more romantic?  The best way to get better next time is to find out what we did right or wrong before. <br><br>  Although in private life we ‚Äã‚Äãoften do not have the opportunity to find out how we looked, there is no reason why we cannot give feedback in our professional life.  In the end, we can be a little less emotional and a little more professional. <br><br>  Despite the extensive information we can get from our candidates, only <a href="http://www.careerarc.com/blog/2016/06/candidate-experience-study-infographic/">one in four employers</a> regularly request feedback from candidates about their impressions.  This not only hampers your ability to improve the experience of the candidates, but also supports a culture that devalues ‚Äã‚Äãfeedback.  This means that <a href="http://recruitingdaily.com/recruiting-tools-hr-technology-candidate-experience/">three-quarters of the candidates</a> never received any requests for feedback on the hiring process, partly because 75% do not know the appropriate person to request feedback. <br><br>  By exchanging reviews, both parties become better in the process of hiring and get a positive impression of the other.  As part of the interview or after the interview, inform the candidate where they can send feedback. <br><br>  A simple way to evaluate a candidate's impressions is to <a href="https://www.hrzone.com/community/blogs/kim-james/the-candidate-experience-enigma">ask</a> : ‚ÄúOn a scale from zero to ten, how likely is it that you would recommend this company as a potential employer?‚Äù  The number you get will be your eNPS (broken employee: Promoter Score, net employee loyalty index), broken down into Promoters (9-10), Skeptics (7-8) and Critics (0-6).  The more promoters you get, the better your process and the more benefits you will get from the good experience of the candidate. <br><br>  <b>Last thoughts</b> <br><br>  By hiring developers, you are trying to find someone with the best abilities and the right skills.  Given the amount of effort you need to apply to your search and testing, it is often easy to lose sight of the candidate‚Äôs experience.  To simplify the task, we made a convenient checklist of the candidate's experience.  Use it to make sure that you are doing everything necessary to ensure a good candidate‚Äôs experience each time a developer enters your ‚Äúcandidate pipeline‚Äù. <br><br>  By providing the best admission process, you will be able to attract the right people needed to grow your business. <br><cut></cut><br><blockquote>  <i>Translator's note: to get a checklist you need to fill out a form <a href="https://devskiller.com/checklist-candidate-experience-software-developers/">at the end</a></i> <i><a href="https://devskiller.com/checklist-candidate-experience-software-developers/"><br></a></i>  <i><a href="https://devskiller.com/checklist-candidate-experience-software-developers/">original article</a> .</i> </blockquote>  At this publication came to an end.
