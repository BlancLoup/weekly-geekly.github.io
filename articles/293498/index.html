Often this concerns banner advertising.  At best, users of mobile devices ignore banners, at worst - banners annoy them.  To improve efficiency and increase the attractiveness of promotional materials, brands and advertisers are beginning to use native, natural advertising, and they are doing this more and more. <br><br>  Native advertising looks natural and works correctly on all platforms.  Advertising of this kind looks like part of the content, improving the level of user engagement.  Such advertising appears in the right place at the right time when working with the application.  For example, this may be an application for tourists, which displays thematic advertising with the provision of information that the user needs.  It can also be a gaming application where advertising is related to the interests and specific actions of the player.  Native advertising is used by some major media in their mobile applications, such as the New York Times.  Advertising is also very effective, such as promoted tweets or posts on Facebook. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Due to the effectiveness of natural advertising, this format becomes preferred for display on mobile devices.  According to the <a href="http://www.emarketer.com/Article/How-Much-Longer-Until-Mobile-Native-Sees-More-Action/1012353">eMarketer</a> forecast, by 2017 more than half of US brands and advertising agencies will invest 25% more money in native advertising.

      In January 2015, Ovum <a href="http://www.iab.net/media/file/IAB_Marketer_Perceptions_2015_Final.pdf">conducted a survey</a> for the Interactive Advertising Bureau, USA.  His results show that respondents put nativeness and naturalness of advertising on mobile devices at the second most important place.  Adaptive design - a point that scored almost as many votes as nativeness, came out on top. <br><br>  Some publishers even began to block banners.  For example, Yahoo, which has built its advertising business on banners, <a href="http://digiday.com/publishers/yahoo-goes-native-mobile/">announced its intention</a> to move away from them and focus exclusively on native advertising.  BuzzFeed is also going to reduce the amount of banner advertising, going in the direction of nativeness. <br><br>  And these actions make sense, especially if you clearly understand the advantages when using natural advertising.  <a href="http://www.appodeal.com/">Appodeal</a> has been working with native advertising for a relatively long time, and in general, we believe that these advantages are: <br><br><h3>  User Experience Improvements </h3><br>  Banner advertising was originally intended for use on the desktop.  It is not particularly effective on mobile devices, on the screens of which such ad looks small, and the text is inconvenient to read.  Also, banners sometimes interfere with the user, as they may cover part of useful content. <br><br>  At the same time, native advertising is organically embedded in the content.  Such advertising is not annoying to the user, since the style and themes of natural advertising are similar to the environment.  If done correctly, native advertising improves User Experience. <br><br><h3>  Flexibility in settings </h3><br>  Banner advertising is presented in several formats.  Their location in the mobile application can be easily predicted.  On websites or in mobile applications, the banner is located at the bottom or at the top.  And, since such banners are standard, ‚Äúbanner blindness‚Äù appears rather quickly when the user does not pay attention to the advertising message. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/644/53d/f4d/64453df4d8b823f5afb012ab65ba1bbb.jpg" width="700"><br><br>  Native advertising offers an advertiser greater flexibility: improved location (almost anywhere on the screen), suitable design.  Formats can be configured independently using the API or SDK of the corresponding service.  Thanks to this, the developer can create his own placement and advertising format for better monetization of the application. <br><br><h3>  Higher CTR </h3><br>  Another reason for brands and advertisers to use native advertising is a higher CTR. <br><br>  <a href="https://digitalcontentnext.org/blog/press/new-opa-study-reveals-native-advertising-best-practices-marketer-goals-and-metrics/">A study by the Online Publisher's Association</a> found that in some cases native advertising CTR is 406% higher than that of banner advertising. <br><br>  At the same time, the latter has many random clicks.  In some cases, the level of such clicks, due to a random click (fat finger, what to do!), Is 50%.  Randomly appearing banners, the user usually seeks to close.  In an effort to remove this kind of advertising, a person sometimes misses and follows the link. <br><br><h3>  Attractive to the user </h3><br>  CTR is only part of the story.  Native advertising, for example in a news feed, also attracts the attention of users, which cannot be said about banner advertising.  In any case, these are the <a href="http://www.sharethrough.com/neuroscience/">results of the study of</a> Sharethrough and Nielsen. <br><br>  Moreover, if native advertising contains content that is attractive to a person, then they look at it longer than regular advertising.  According to the <a href="http://www.mobilemarketer.com/cms/news/research/20522.preview">report of</a> Mobile Marketing, the time for viewing natural advertising is 2 to 5 times higher. <br><br>  It is likely that native advertising has the future of mobile devices.  Appropriate platforms and services give advertisers the opportunity to optimize such content.  Thus, both users and advertisers get exactly what they need.  And this is good. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/293498/">https://habr.com/ru/post/293498/</a></p>
