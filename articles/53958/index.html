  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Who needs SLA?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Many of you have probably heard, and discussed such initiatives as the ‚ÄúService Level Agreement‚Äù (SLA or Service Level Agreement);  Many probably use it when working with external providers.  For example, with telecom providers. <br><br>  Do you need such an agreement within the company?  How is the agreement between the IT service and the business unit?  In fact, you can write anything, but if the IT service or business unit violates the agreement, then it is impossible to apply penalties, such as not paying or renewing the contract with a new supplier. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It turns out this is not an agreement, but an agreement of intent.  So do you need it?  It's like a marriage contract or something.  We hope to live happily ever after, but we don‚Äôt forget to register such details as who and when makes the bucket and walks with the dog. <br><br>  If we drop all these new and fashionable trends, ITSM and so on, and take a look at how a consumer IT business evaluates a service?  Yes, everything is very simple - satisfied or not satisfied.  If all this is simplified, then all services that do not earn money are evaluated very simply, namely, whether they meet expectations or not.  It turns out that if the IT service can simply put the expectations of its customers in accordance with the quality of work that they are capable of issuing, then this will give a serious improvement in the assessment of the work of the IT service.

      So, in order to start working with user expectations, you need to start creating SLAs.  At the same time, one should be aware that SLA is by no means bureaucratic protection against user requests.  Type - we do not have to do this.  There is a special term for such maneuvers - the Italian strike, this is when workers start working strictly in accordance with job descriptions.  In our case, it should be a summary of our intentions. <br><br>  A very important point is that it is impossible to prescribe in it parameters that are difficult to achieve.  Well, let's say, the reaction within 5 minutes.  This will simply lead to frustration.  It is better to prescribe such parameters that are always achieved without effort.  After you have made sure that it is achievable, you can already coordinate with the users the new conditions of the service and improve it.  This technique is considered basic to restore order in organizations.  First, set the minimum necessary rules that are difficult to break.  When we have achieved that these rules are executed, and not to fulfill them is simply hard, because it already works in this mode and with such quality, and only after that they start to ‚Äútighten the screws‚Äù. <br><br>  Below you can see an example of a simple service level agreement.  The parameters are real there, yes, it was from these 8 hours to the solution of a critical problem that we started.  The text there was English, this is my translation.  If anyone has examples of SLA, then send, publish. <br><br>  <a href="http://tools4cio.ru/%3Fdl_id%3D8">An example of a simple service level agreement</a> (32.1 Kb) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/53958/">https://habr.com/ru/post/53958/</a></p>
