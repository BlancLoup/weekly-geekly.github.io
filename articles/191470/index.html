The company became popular thanks to a class of devices called Power Bank. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/543/532/2e9/5435322e960557194a02d4623464a82b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  For those who do not know, Power Bank is a portable battery that allows you to charge your gadget if you are far from an outlet.  This is a kind of rechargeable battery in advance, which, in turn, gives its charge to your electronic device.  With all this, some portable chargers are able to charge the smartphone several times in a row from a full charge.  Of course, the number of full charges of your devices depends directly on the battery capacity, as well as on the capacity of your device.  We were lucky to test a new model called the Yoobao YB-665. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  Packaging </h1>  The device comes in a presentable cardboard box.

If you have a device from this company, you can check it on the <a href="http://www.yoobao.com/en/Services.asp%3Flgy_id%3D193">official website</a> by entering the 20 digit code. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d3b/ac1/d0e/d3bac1d0eb3d9a94c6ac0152e9eeea09.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  On the reverse side shows information about USB ports, company information, as well as certification badges. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/976/974/c6c/976974c6cefb3f5a88ba182c74af6084.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  On the side, in large print, is the type of device. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c2e/4e9/515/c2e4e9515efb18f6bd2f14db29e7db52.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  Inside the box is the device itself, wrapped in a bag <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/587/5d8/4be/5875d84be4b89ebc0c0bbdefe9cffb9e.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  There is also a power supply, microUSB cable and 30-pin adapter for Apple products.  Unfortunately, the adapter to the euro plug was not found. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7e3/477/fe4/7e3477fe49463af9d18318d3c7c8d821.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  The power supply YB-706 has good performance - it can issue up to 2 amps at a voltage of 5 volts. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a67/a97/2a3/a67a972a3c23e6c5511108865f1dd1d2.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  I would not say that the equipment is quite extensive.  In my opinion, there is not enough of a cover, because the device will still not be at home, so it is prone to scratches.  Still, you don't want to spoil his strict look.  Although there are few adapters, there is no inconvenience with this - now most devices use a microUSB connector. <br><br><h1>  Device design </h1>  Yoobao YB-665 looks like a brick, but with rounded edges.  Power Bank is made of glossy plastic and perfectly collects "fingers." <br>  Dimensions of the device are 152.5x75x23 mm.  Weight - 380 grams. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/638/d04/959/638d049598a6e043c1104a99fc9d7407.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  Pressing the power button activates 5 LEDs that let you know the current charge level.  Accordingly, 1 LED is &lt;20%, 2 LEDs 20-40%, 3 LEDs 40-60%, 4 LEDs 60-80% and 5 LEDs 80-100%.  The indicator on the power button also has an LED.  If the light is red, then the device is charging, blue is charged. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4ba/e0f/5d8/4bae0f5d87f15548876ec0e7bad695d4.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  Below is the corporate logo of the company. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ae1/78b/8c1/ae178b8c1c5e572129c09e88bba59a13.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  On the back side, there are stubs along the edges, and legs from Power Bank'a just below. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/790/78e/399/79078e39999d45710202217cf8717db1.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  Below is information about the device and the serial number, which is often absent from fakes. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9ed/dc3/8ab/9eddc38ab02ac4929572380cddcb4b1b.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  At the top there are three functional holes.  Two USB ports for charging devices with an output power of 1A and 2A respectively.  There is also a powerful LED.  The flashlight turns on by long pressing the button, turns off as well.  It shines normally, to navigate in the dark is enough. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2d0/410/d67/2d0410d672c2674c4941e76cd06edd1e.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  Throughout the body there is a belt in the form of a silver plastic strip. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6e5/4ba/82b/6e54ba82be3855ef50d085901f8429f3.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  The body is pleasant to the touch and lies comfortably in the hand, it feels quite strong.  There are no complaints about the appearance either, everything is done in a standard brick style. <br><br><h1>  Testing </h1>  I tested very simply.  I charged the Power Bank at night and then discharged it with the same device until fully charged. <br><table><tbody><tr><td>  <b>Device</b> </td><td>  <b>Battery capacity</b> </td><td>  <b>Charging time</b> </td><td>  <b>The number of full charges</b> </td></tr><tr><td>  LG Nexus 4 </td><td>  2100 mAh </td><td>  3.5 hours </td><td>  five </td></tr><tr><td>  Samsung Galaxy S4 </td><td>  2600 mAh </td><td>  4.3 h </td><td>  five </td></tr><tr><td>  TcL Idol X </td><td>  2000 mAh </td><td>  3.3 hours </td><td>  6 </td></tr></tbody></table>  The results are certainly not completely accurate.  Because I sometimes used devices to answer calls.  You also need to take into account the loss of energy, as is usually on the charge set in the morning or evening.  The charging time is indicated as an average, since the switched off state of the device charges faster, and when it is on, it takes longer.  Yes, and I think that the number of charging cycles is enough for many users. <br>  In general, the capacity is real and there is no doubt that this is the original. <br><br><h1>  Insides </h1>  Power Bank is assembled very high quality.  Below there are 4 screws that need to be unscrewed.  To disassemble the device, it was necessary to damage the case and apply force, since besides the screws, the upper part was also glued.  It is necessary to tear it off, but not to shoot it. <br>  The insides are simply inserted into the case and also glued.  You can see the assembly of six batteries type 18650. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bf8/4b0/be3/bf84b0be3ec2519070096bb320b647b4.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  Each of the six 2600 mAh.  There is still, apparently, the name of the manufacturer, but I have not found this.  The capacity of the bank, judging by the labeling, is exactly as promised by the manufacturer (2600 mAh * 6 = 15600 mAh). <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9f0/aa6/0ac/9f0aa60acd5317d147f6c1a883171423.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br><h1>  Price and purchase </h1>  You can buy the device in the <a href="http://www.tinydeal.com/(YOOBAO)-YB-665-15600mAh-External-Power-Bank-p-98737.html%3Fsk%3D41327677uV">TinyDeal</a> store for $ 62.27 with coupon <b>NQ098IKk10</b> , which gives a 10% discount.  Good luck with your purchases! <br><br><h1>  Conclusion </h1> This type of device is becoming increasingly relevant.  Manufacturers of smartphones increase the performance of devices, but their energy consumption is little cared for.  Therefore, often the device asks for charging, but it is not at hand.  But many people need to be in touch 24 hours a day and need to recharge their smartphone, tablet or player.  Especially Power bank is useful for travelers and tourists! <br>  Yoobao YB-665 with its capacity will help extend the life of your voracious gadgets. <br><br><h1>  Advantages and disadvantages </h1><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a7/99a/ea7/3a799aea7d11fc5d49274e15b6642e35.png" alt="image">  High real capacity <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a7/99a/ea7/3a799aea7d11fc5d49274e15b6642e35.png" alt="image">  Two USB ports <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a7/99a/ea7/3a799aea7d11fc5d49274e15b6642e35.png" alt="image">  Torch <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a7/99a/ea7/3a799aea7d11fc5d49274e15b6642e35.png" alt="image">  Current charge indication <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a7/99a/ea7/3a799aea7d11fc5d49274e15b6642e35.png" alt="image">  Stylish appearance <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4f2/996/400/4f29964003baaf62d7bfefa7f2e32bf1.png" alt="image">  Cover missing <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4f2/996/400/4f29964003baaf62d7bfefa7f2e32bf1.png" alt="image">  No additional adapters <br><br>  If you do not have an account on Habrahabr, you can read and comment on our articles on <a href="http://boxoverview.com/">BoxOverview.com</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/191470/">https://habr.com/ru/post/191470/</a></p>
