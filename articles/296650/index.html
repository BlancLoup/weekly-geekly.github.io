  <section class="page js-page"><h1>OneTwoTrip received $ 4 million investment from Vostok New Ventures</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The domestic travel agency, which provides its services in Russia, the former CIS countries and Europe, on the eve of it received very substantial funding in the amount of US $ 4 million from the Swedish venture fund Vostok New Ventures with ‚ÄúSoviet‚Äù roots. <br><br>  According <a href="http://tech.eu/brief/onetwotrip-funding-vostok-new-ventures/">to the</a> portal Tech.eu, data on the transaction became available to the Internet public after the Swedish company published financial statements for the current year in progress.  It is known that the Swedish Venture Fund was not limited to just the OneTwoTrip project, for only the third quarter of 2015, by investing funds in the amount of 7.5 million in a startup Merro, working on its own investment platform.  Much larger amount went to financing the well-known service BlaBlaCar for organizing joint car trips, which is becoming increasingly popular in the domestic market. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Startup OneTwoTrip was created in 2011 and offered online hotel and flight reservation services.  It is known that in March of this year, the company managed to attract investments for $ 8 million, and a little earlier to overcome the threshold of 25 million from such major players in the venture capital market, such as Phenomenon Ventures, Goldman Sachs, and Atomico, the company co-founder of the well-known messenger Skype Niklas Zennstrom (Niklas Zennstr√∂m). <br><br>  Despite constant injections into the project, the popularity of the OneTwoTrip falls.  Thus, according to the agency SimilarWeb, the number of visitors to the official site of a travel startup over the past six months has almost halved - from 1.5 million in May to 880,000 in October.  Apparently, the online service is not able to adequately confront competitors in the face of startups such as, for example, Anywayanyday and Biletix.  The fact is somewhat surprising, given the number of investments and the overall positive trends in the online tourism market, whose turnover last year amounted to $ 11.2 billion.  In addition, every year in this area there is a steady growth of 24%.

      The Swedish venture fund with such a sound for Russian-speaking users name was formed as a result of the restructuring of the company Old Vostok Nafta, which originated in 1996, when the head of the company Adolf H. Lundin decided to register the company for organizing direct investments in the market of the former USSR countries.  Now Vostok New Ventures is considered to be very serious players in the field of venture investment, having such projects in its portfolio as Avito, Gett, Yell, Delivery Hero, etc. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296650/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296650/</a></p>
