You can have a different attitude towards Shop-Script products that were available until today.  The product had its own problems and difficulties, but now is not about that. <br><br>  Today we announced a new version of the product - <b>Shop-Script 5</b> . <br><br><img src="http://new.shop-script.ru/wa-data/public/site/img/blog/habr/ss5-timeline-2012.png" alt="image">

      <br>
    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  With the help of Shop-Script 5, we plan to solve problems with which previous versions of the product handled with difficulty. <br><br>  We developed Shop-Script 5 from a clean slate and spent a lot of time observing how real online stores work on the basis of our products, which takes the time of operators when processing orders, what data and reports are missing, which of these tasks can be solved means of the script, and most importantly - how to make a product to help online stores to earn more. <br><br><img src="http://new.shop-script.ru/wa-data/public/site/img/blog/habr/ss5-backend-products.png" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Flexibility of adaptation </h4><br>  The two main problems of previous generations of Shop-Script that most of our customers have encountered are the <i>difficulty of customizing the</i> logic of the scripts and a rigid <i>tabular layout</i> (which was, that was ...).  Since each store has its own characteristics, and everyone needs its own beautiful storefront, it was impossible to move on without solving the problem of flexibility. <br><br>  In Shop-Script 5 we solved this task, having previously developed a whole <a href="http://www.webasyst.com/ru/">PHP-framework</a> and created a new Shop-Script based on it.  The second problem was solved by itself after modifying the design templates from scratch.  We had to sacrifice the possibility of automatically transferring design from previous generations of products, however, this allowed us to make the design editor truly flexible in customizing templates. <br><br>  (You can see the layout examples on the <a href="http://demo-ru.webasyst.com/">example of</a> the Blog and Photo <a href="http://demo-ru.webasyst.com/photos/">apps</a> ; for the new Shop-Script, the design templates will be published along with the official release of the product, and they will be built in the same way.) <br><br><img src="http://new.shop-script.ru/wa-data/public/site/img/blog/habr/ss5-design-editor.png" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Product Search </h4><br>  Search using <code>%LIKE%</code> , of course, an option, but a bad one. <br><br>  To implement a search in Shop-Script 5, we index all products, taking into account the morphology and setting different weights for descriptions, arbitrary custom characteristics, categories and types of products.  If you don‚Äôt be lazy and fill in several categories for categories (not for individual products, but only for product categories), this will allow visitors to the store‚Äôs front end to find products for queries like ‚Äúwhite iPhone‚Äù, ‚Äúvideo card with dvi‚Äù, ‚Äúsnowboard mounts‚Äù . <br><br><h4>  Recommended Products </h4><br>  Recommendation of related and related products based on different criteria: <br>  - based on the data that other customers bought together with the products that the buyer added to the basket, <br>  - based on the values ‚Äã‚Äãof the characteristics of the products, which is useful to recommend to the buyer similar and more expensive models. <br><br>  When the store is just starting to work and there is not enough data, these mechanisms can still be used, because it is always possible to determine where the user came from the store, what products and categories they looked at, whether they were searching for something in the store, etc. <br><br><img src="http://new.shop-script.ru/wa-data/public/site/img/blog/habr/ss5-settings-recommendations.png" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Printing forms for orders </h4><br>  Experience shows that online stores (especially small ones) operating in Russia spend an incredible amount of time processing orders for paperwork: preparing invoices, waybills, and especially filling out forms with Russian Post when sending orders for parcels.  After you send a few parcels in the nearest post office, it becomes clear that the function of automated form filling (directly over GIF-images ready for printing) is not just a cool feature, but a necessary thing. <br><br>  We still receive many grateful comments from users of previous versions of Shop-Script for this seemingly simple function. <br><br><h4>  Internal API of Webasyst framework </h4><br>  In the product description, you can fully use Smarty and use the Webasyst internal API to integrate Shop-Script with other installed applications.  For example, using the <b><code>{$photos = $wa-&gt;photos-&gt;photos('tag/nexus7')}</code></b> you can get all the photos from the Photo application with the ‚Äúnexus7‚Äù tag and then output them in the product description using <code>{foreach $photos}...{/foreach}</code> . <br><br>  And there are many more different functions like selling services, multistore, follow-up messages, SMS notifications, etc.  All these functions will be available in Shop-Script 5 immediately "out of the box." <br><br>  In the future, for Shop-Script 5 and the Webasyst framework, an application store will be opened, through which you can install new themes, plug-ins and modules directly through the browser with one click (the framework downloads the scripts from the server and installs them). <br><br>  <i>Shop-Script 5 will go on sale on March 12, 2013, and today, the functionality of the new product can be found in detail on the site <a href="http://new.shop-script.ru/">http://new.shop-script.ru</a> .</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/163221/">https://habr.com/ru/post/163221/</a></p>
