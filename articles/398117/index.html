    <br clear="all"><br><a name="2"></a><h1>  Chapter 2. Add to friends? </h1><br><br>  Very hot.  Black squinted and looked around. <br>  The sun. <br>  This arrogant ruthless light. <br>  Eyes were watery due to allergies, which started with the arrival of spring.  The electronic clock on the table showed 13:37. <br>  Well, well, he grinned. <br>  Black was already half an hour in bed.  I wanted water.  My throat is dry, as happens when you sleep with your mouth open.  The body ached.  It seemed that not only the clothes that were too lazy to take off, but also his head seemed to heal. <br>  Unloved time. <br>  After a night spent at the computer, the world looked gray and repulsive.  Like an alcoholic who is trying to get out of binge drinking.  Black drank so often last year that he knew this condition well.  Moreover, most recently he made a promise to his girlfriend Ira to start with alcohol and smoking. <br>  Forever and ever. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  “Cigarettes and alcohol - for wimps!  Understand you!  Their producers simply profit from dependent people.  And most importantly, they are destroying our nation, ”the arguments, boring, similar to agitation slogans, arguments surfaced in the head ... <br>  But he had to agree. <br>  So it was easier. <br>  I wanted to prove that she was mistaken. <br>  Lasted 16 days. <br>  The look focused on an ashtray with yesterday's cigarette butts. <br>  "Could not resist.  Slacker, ”Irin’s voice sounded in his mind. <br>  Well, then, now another cigarette will not change anything.  She will definitely be the last. <br>  Black rose, looking for the eyes of the lighter.  An unexpected surge of energy.  A memory of yesterday’s message from Mar came to my mind.  Maxim turned on the computer, surprised at his carelessness. <br><br>  And why didn't I do it right away?  So silly!  Damned insomnia.  With this anti-nicotine abstinence, I became too absent-minded. <br>  Last excuse, and Black lit up.  He opened the letter and, without reading it, looked at the sender's address. <br>  mar@alisssanerd.ru <br>  Just in case, the SMTP header looked, but did not find anything interesting.  I went to the site, but he did not open.  Entered the address in the whois service to check the domain owner, and thought. <br>  Maksim V. Pavlov <br>  It seems that a divorce is more serious than it seemed to me. <br>  Black opened the icq and told Red. <br><br>  “Red (14:02:03 05/10/2005): <br>  what <br><br>  “Red (14:02:03 05/10/2005): <br>  domain is registered in your name? " <br><br>  “Black (14:02:30 05/10/2005): <br>  Yes.  Pavlov Maxim " <br><br>  “Red (14:03:04 05/10/2005): <br>  mb namesake? <br><br>  “Red (14:03:10 05/10/2005): <br>  or is the owner’s phone the same? ” <br><br>  “Black (14:03:30 05/10/2005): <br>  My number is indicated » <br><br>  “Red (14:03:50 05/10/2005): <br>  hm listen turn to the green " <br><br>  “Red (14:03:59 05/10/2005): <br>  he must know the services to punch the domain owner " <br><br>  Reasonable.  Black found Green in the contact list. <br><br>  “Black (14:03:33 05/10/2005): <br>  Great.  How do you?  I immediately to the point.  We need to know the passport data of the domain owner.  Is this possible? ” <br><br>  “Green (14:03:33 05/10/2005): <br>  Ku <br>  Which domain? <br><br>  Black sent an address to his friend. <br>  He liked in Green that he never asked too many questions.  Now I just had to wait. <br>  After two puffs, the thirst became even stronger, and he put out a cigarette.  Headache. <br>  Black got up, almost falling, stumbling over a blanket on the floor and went to the kitchen.  Ira often complained about how unpleasant she was to be here because of the mess.  She said that the apartment did not have enough female hand and comfort, all the more aggressively hinting at the move. <br><br>  Going to the sink, he opened the faucet and took cold water in his hands.  Loaded in their face.  Freshness.  Black was about to take the cup, but again he remembered Ira, who did not like his bruises under his eyes, and therefore she forbade him to drink unfiltered water.  Allegedly, it had a bad effect on the kidneys.  Maxim could not prove to her that the reason is different, that it happens to almost everyone who spends too much time in front of the monitor. <br>  He began to swallow water straight from the tap. <br><br>  They met on the Internet when he was 17, and she was 19. Maxim, then, like many friends, often climbed porn sites.  When he got access to other people's credit cards, he began to pay for their private video chats.  Ira was one of the girls who earned by undressing in front of a webcam.  Usually, trying to portray a foreigner, he wrote them in English, but once he realized that he was Russian, without knowing why, he started a conversation in his native language.  After a while, took her phone number.  Relationships evolved quickly. <br>  Ira was from Voronezh.  Since childhood, she dreamed of leaving her native city, considering herself worthy of more, becoming a famous actress or a successful model.  She told how difficult it is to break through somewhere without connections, and that, therefore, having learned from a friend about the lucrative work on foreign websites, she decided that it was a good option to save money for moving to Moscow.  Moreover, the organizers promised complete anonymity, and that their clients were foreigners. <br>  When Maxim worked with carders, and he began to receive money, he insisted that she give up her job and help her move to the capital.  I paid for professional shooting for a portfolio in a model agency, because Ira said that her photos look too provincial.  He was pleased to help her, although he was not sure that her career model shines.  Black doubted that she was as beautiful as she thought.  He did not like her eyes too large and wide apart, making her look like a fish or an alien.  And this nose is like a little penny.  When she was angry, sometimes there was a feeling that she was about to grumble. <br><br>  He wanted them to live together, but Ira insisted that it was better not to rush until school was over, allegedly because of her parents.  As a result, they found her a room not far from her house, in order to see more often. <br>  Now, when three years have passed, their relationship has changed a lot.  Ira spent a lot of time on casting and filming, the agency had to taste her “interesting, not standard face”.  We met rarely, swore more.  Ira increasingly hinted that it was time to move to a new stage, to start living together.  Began to roll scenes of jealousy.  Black did not tell the truth about what he was doing.  This aroused suspicion, she thought that he was cheating. <br>  - Do you think me some kind of fool ?!  - Ira screamed during another quarrel. <br>  After such questions, Black was lost, not knowing how to answer.  What can I say to the person who chose his nickname SweetKitten18.  What to say to the girl who cares only she.  Why bother to say anything? <br>  He had long wanted to quit this relationship, but did not dare. <br>  When Black moved out of his parents to a separate apartment, he settled there alone. <br><br>  He looked at the dishwasher, loaded the cups with plates in there and turned on the machine.  In the evening, the parents were supposed to come, and I didn’t want to hear from my mother, what a mess he had. <br>  Black took a plate of scrambled eggs, a cup of coffee and returned to the computer.  There was already a message from Green. <br><br>  The domain was registered with his data from the new passport, which he recently received after his twentieth anniversary.  Black rushed to check the documents and abruptly opened the drawer of the table, wondering who could pull him when and when. <br>  Passport in place. <br>  Lies in its new brown cover, donated by Ira. <br>  He took it in his hands, just in case he looked through several times, looked at the light and even sniffed.  It smells fresh skin. <br>  Nothing suspicious.  It seems that no one touched the document. <br>  Black sat on the chair. <br>  Who is this mar and how did he get the data. <br>  He began to feel sick of the assumptions and Black decided to take a walk. <br><br>  *** <br><br>  After walking a couple of hours through the streets of Moscow, Black stopped in a park not far from his home.  Physical fatigue worked soothingly.  He sat enjoying the weather.  Spring.  Favorite season.  Neither hot nor cold, fresh wind, the first sun and the feeling of hope that everything can be changed.  Black looked at the children, lost in thought. <br><br>  Naive, he thought.  As long as parents protect their children, the child’s brain is not capable of deceit.  These little people still do not know that relatives can betray, and each act has two sides, which are not always noticeable to others.  They do not imagine that sometimes they will have to choose not what is good, but what is necessary, just to somehow exist in this world.  Happy. " <br><br>  The flow of thoughts interrupted the familiar voice of Red. <br><br>  - Hi brother! <br>  Tall, slightly slouching, wearing washed-up jeans, a shirt, with headphones on his head and a backpack on his shoulders.  Blond curly hair and not a man's plump lips.  Pasha, he's Red, best friend in life.  We went to school together, sat at the same desk, both recognized the world on the net, moved there and made their first money.  They were so close that when Black moved, Red rented an apartment in the same area. <br><br>  Pasha was the rare person Black really trusted.  He had long been convinced that online feelings such as honesty and sincerity should be forgotten forever, if you do not want problems. <br><br>  “There are only temporary acquaintances with whom something connects you.  Partners, ”he justified his unwillingness to move closer to new people.  - “About any friendship and speech can not be, if you do not want such a friend to surrender you at the first interrogation.” <br>  With Red, everything was different.  Pasha, one of the few on the Internet, knew the real name of Black - Max. <br><br>  The first acquaintance with the network from friends happened at the age of 14.  Father gave Maxim a birthday modem, and for some reason he took the word from his son that this purchase would help him.  He probably meant something else, but, in general, he was right.  Black remembers that moment as turning in his life. <br><br>  Having connected to the internet for the first time, he didn’t know what to do.  He called Red, with whom they began to torment rambler.  The guys spent more than one day doing this.  Once at school, a classmate gave a link to the Quake 3 fan site. It was one of his favorite toys.  There he heard for the first time the word “hackers” when some pest hacked the project, and on the main page hung a link to their forum. <br><br>  He was curious and he went to see who they were.  He did not understand almost a single word of the topics discussed.  Deface, float, trojan, flood, sniff.  There was a lot of information, and he began to sit on this forum of black color all day long.  He told Red, who later became involved too. <br><br>  Now he is funny and a little ashamed to remember those times, but it's nice.  Happy carefree days.  At first, Black was doing what the newcomers in the affair love to suffer.  Defisil sites, brutied passwords to mails and icq, used free internet and hacked chat mail.ru.  Then it was fun for him, he rested with his friends after, and more and more often, instead of school. <br><br>  There were three of them.  Black, Red, and Green are the guy they met on the forum.  They came up with such nicknames at the same time to somehow show their unity, took three colors that seemed appropriate to them, and called themselves hacking “SPECTRUM”.  Black is serious and dark, Red is hot-tempered and bright, and Green is the most calm and sensible. <br><br>  And although formally their team had long since broken up as unnecessary, they were still friends, and their nicknames were more and more justified.  Black plunged into illegal activity, contacted carders, sold stolen bases to them and wrote exploits.  Red departed from the hack, went deep into programming, unlike the best friend, did it rather out of interest, he didn’t have much money with him.  Green, who started as an avid actor, was the first to become interested in carding.  He was interested in everything that brought money.  Any occupation in the network, where he needed the talent of an entrepreneur. <br><br>  Now, when the fun turned into work, and there was a list of cases for which you can get a term, Black became very careful.  I did not want to go to prison, so I had to constantly lie and hide.  He even began to doubt whether it was worth telling a friend he had always trusted about the letter.  But it was too late. <br>  - Hey are you there?  - Red looked at him.  - Move over. <br>  “I'm glad to see you too,” smiled Black.  - How do you? <br>  - I?  The best! <br>  - Is it after yesterday? <br>  - Yesterday?  And what about yesterday?  Are you talking about dnyuhu?  In vain did not go!  It was hurt.  Ira your only about you constantly asked, got, to be honest.  You already have it, or leave her, or do something, I do not know ... <br>  “Ira,” Black mumbled. <br>  He absolutely didn’t want to think, much less talk about his girlfriend, because of which he didn’t manage to merge the base of credit cards yesterday. <br>  “Listen, I understand what's the matter,” Red said cheerfully. <br>  - What? <br>  - How is it that there is a domain in your name and phone number?  Maybe this, that?  - grinning, he twisted at his temple. <br>  - What?  - Black did not understand. <br>  - Well it.  Suffering a split personality.  You know.  He wrote and forgot himself? <br>  Black looked at him in surprise. <br>  - Are you kidding me?  Palanika read something? <br>  - So what?  Why just scoff?  Think of it!  Mind games?  - continued Red.  - Even if this is true, then you will not know! <br>  “Oh, you,” Black, who, though he liked the story of Tyler, did not want to joke now.  - Better really think about who and how could get my passport information. <br>  - Did you check the computer?  Nout? <br>  - Yes, I checked everything. <br>  A few minutes later the conversation went to a dead end, and Red, who did not seem to appreciate his friend's feelings, turned the subject.  He got a beer out of his backpack. <br>  - Hold on.  I completely forgot. <br>  Black hesitated, because he decided that he had already quit drinking.  But he absolutely did not want to talk about it, much less listen to what a henpecked he was.  He took the bottle, opened it and took a sip. <br>  Cold <br>  Without noticing himself, he drank it all down almost in one gulp. <br>  - Good beer.  It’s worth living for that, ”he said thoughtfully, trying to avoid talking about himself. <br>  “Someone thinks it’s worth living for this,” Red grinned, pointing at the pocket from which the wallet was sticking out. <br>  He obviously had problems with money. <br>  Again. <br>  - Money, they rule the world.  The whole world.  Even the network.  Noticed how the Internet has changed?  - he asked Black with a philosophical expression. <br>  - Well, yes ... Everything changes ... - Maxim squeezed out of himself, who didn’t want to listen at all, his friend’s complaints, which had already become familiar. <br>  “Before, everyone was eager for knowledge,” Red continued, “we studied, searched, learned.”  Now ... <br>  A teenager rode by on a bicycle, from whose headphones came Kanye West. <br>  - It's like a turnip! <br>  - In terms of? <br>  - Well, look, used to be WuTang, Onyx, 2Pac.  Yes, gangsters.  They were personalities with their own history, thoughts, and ideas.  They worked because they wanted to prove something.  And now?  A huge number of indistinguishable rappers sing about how cool they live, and what a buzz when a lot of dough. <br>  “Yes ...” Black opened another bottle, he tried to listen to a friend. <br>  - Also in the underground.  All newbies want easy money.  I downloaded it, hacked the forum, flooded the shell and was done.  Not a damn thing to do and get loot, ”Red got excited, who liked to philosophize.  - Few people are interested just to look for vulnerabilities, the main thing is to sell them. <br>  - Come on, Pasch.  Stop whining, - he smiled, said Black.  - All the way, this is life, you and I are not much better.  Although in something you are right.  I propose a toast to the knowledge!  He said loudly and took a sip. <br>  “For new knowledge,” Red supported and took a sip.  - Good beer. <br>  Red was very different from his friend.  He lived more often in debt, he hardly paid rented housing and occasionally ate noodles from the packages.  Despite his intellectual abilities, he did not know how to earn.  And even when something appeared, everything was quickly spent on drugs and alcohol. <br>  “Good life,” said Black with pleasure. <br>  Despite all the problems, the mood improved.  They sat for some time and went their separate ways. <br><br>  *** <br><br>  At home, as always, the first thing Black checked the mail. <br>  “Spam, spam, spam,” he said aloud, removing the letters from the mailbox. <br>  Attention drew the headline "I look after you, Blackie."  He read the text. <br><br>  <i>“My dear blackies.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>I see everything and want to help you, I know even what you yourself do not know yet.</i>  <i>problems are coming one after another, and then it will only get worse, do not give up, I'm with you.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>-</i> <i><br></i>  <i>your friend Mar</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>ps</i>  <i>Do not miss your blond love today at midnight in the store opposite. "</i> <br><br>  Black sent a letter to the basket.  He was annoyed by this Mar, whoever he was.  He decided that the best cure for the experience was work.  Moreover, my mother called and said that they could not come today, so the whole evening was free. <br><br>  Maxim launched Mozilla.  A window appeared - Restore the previous session? <br>  Yes - without hesitation, he pressed and looked at the opened tabs. <br><br>  <i>Whois service ... |</i>  <i>Mazafaka ... |</i>  <i>WASM ....</i> <br><br>  Black was going to modify the virus, the source of which was recently dispersed on the Internet.  He exploited a buffer overflow in MS SQL Server 2000. Maxim got into the code and stopped thinking about something else. <br>  It was only when the cigarettes that he smoked out, forgetting about his promise, ended, Black finally got distracted and decided to go to the store. <br>  The clock was 23:15. <br><br>  *** <br><br>  While Black Kodil, it rained outside, and the roads were covered in puddles.  Despite the fact that it was already May, it was immediately cold outside. <br><br>  "In vain he did not take the jacket," he thought, "Although it may shiver me from fear?" He immediately grinned to himself. <br><br>  Black was not from cowardly people, but not where the matter concerned the police, department K, the FSB, the FBI, and everything else in that spirit.  In these questions, he often caught himself thinking that he was being watched, and at times it seemed that there was some kind of cunning thing everywhere.  He understood that he was exaggerating, but he could do nothing with it.  Tried to think many times before, something to tell someone. <br><br>  And now he was going to meet with some girl about whom a stranger had written. <br><br>  He was curious, and nothing, no common sense, would have been able to reason with Black. <br>  He stopped in front of a traffic light.  The puddles glowed red, and an unpleasant wind blew into the back of the head.  Each person has his own strangeness, it was his - to go only to the green light, even when the road is empty. <br><br>  “Hi, Max,” a woman’s voice came from behind her. <br>  A shiver ran through her body. <br>  “Maybe this is she?” - immediately a thought appeared in her head.  - “But I'm still not in the store.  .   ,    ?» <br>    ,        ,        . <br> — , , , —    ,   ,  . <br>     .   ,     .    ,   .  -      ,    .     ,   . <br> «,      ?» —   . <br> —  ? —    ,    . <br>             .         ,  -          .   ,      . <br> «,     », —      . <br> —  , , —  . —   ? ? ? <br>      ,    ,     - .   .  ,   . <br>  - . <br> «, ,  », —  ,   . <br> —  . , —    , — ,   ,    .

He considered him to be his enemy, and sometimes he began to think about murder.  Of course, not seriously, but he liked to imagine that, theoretically, such a possibility exists.  Their dislike was mutual. <br><br>  The first time Black heard about him in one of the forums, when he was just starting his way as a hacker.  By that time, Stills was already known in the underground get-together, kept his project dedicated to information security, wrote articles for a hacker magazine, but very few people knew about what he was doing.  Maxim, then still in school, he did not play enough of a hacker and loved to attract attention to himself by any means.  Once, together with Red, they hacked the Stills website and hung a deface there, like "Hacked by Black &amp; Red".  For them at that time it was a special event.  They were just lucky, but they talked a lot about it.  So much interest in two unknown guys before.  Black and Red were jubilant. <br><br>  Contact sheet icq increased dramatically, filling with new contacts.  Maxim, while still naive, talked too much about himself, and finding him was not a big deal.  Finding new friends, he, as is usually the case, found enemies.  Stills, who wanted to take revenge on the offender, through his acquaintances, learned everything he needed and drew the attention of law enforcement agencies to Black, who liked to use the Internet at someone else's expense. <br><br>  Stils was all the same for what will attract a guy, he wanted to really punish the upstart. <br><br>  For Black, it was a shock.  As a result, because of his age, he received only a suspended sentence. <br>  It was hard to explain everything to parents.  Maxim invented a bike that did not understand what he was doing.  He himself doubted that his father and mother believed in it, but those had little choice.  He was not denied access to a computer, but was told to forget about the Internet while he was living in their house. <br><br>  It seemed to be the end.  What should he do without forums, ICQ, online communication?  Without hackers?  What to spend all the free time?  Of course, he could find access to the Internet from his friend, but Black was scared and decided to slow down.  In addition to games, he became interested in coding.  He was no longer enough just to spend time at the computer, I wanted to figure it out.  He began to learn programming languages, studied Linux, FreeBSD.  The father did not object to this, and even bought his son CDs with software distribution kits and electronic libraries. <br><br>  The network went, but rarely, usually from Red, to read the forums and, sometimes, ask questions to more experienced people.  Only in 17 years I connected myself to the Internet.  By that time, Black already had a stock of knowledge, and he understood how foolish and insignificant everything was what he had done and was proud of before.  That now he can not only entertain, but also earn the money that he has become necessary. <br><br>  At first he tried to do it legally, selling website engines and writing custom scripts.  But Green, who by that time had become one of the administrators of the popular icq project and already imbued with the theme of carding, advised Black to try it out there. <br><br>  “If you don’t know what to do, just work for someone, even think about hammering,” Green once said when Maxim complained to a friend about money problems.  Black thought. <br><br>  For a month, he visited a popular Karders forum, where among endless announcements about buying and selling, advertising services and services, he read useful articles for newbies.  Studying this topic, Black delved into the world of banking frauds and eventually quickly found his place there.  He began to engage in hacking, but with a different purpose.  Now Black was interested in the credit card database. <br><br>  He remembered well his first hacking for money.  It was not like in childhood.  Nervous much stronger.  After all, he understood that it was not just illegal, but connected with theft.  Having the experience of meeting with law enforcement agencies, for a long time he doubted whether it was worth getting involved in it at all.  But the desire to earn and excitement defeated fear. <br><br>  Once, having visited the store site and clicking on several links, Black stopped at the product page.  Mechanically, he added a quotation mark to the product number in the URL, and, as usual, he was met by a page with a MySQL query error.  With a few queries, he retrieved the table names and the names of the fields containing customer information and, to save time, launched a self-written script for dumping tables.  A few minutes later he already had data on all customers of this store.  And at the same time about their credit cards. <br>  It turned out to be so simple. <br><br>  I found a buyer on the forum and got my money.  Black was pleased. <br><br>  I also tried myself in clothing carding, but I quickly realized that it was not for him.  One day, after reading articles, Black bought an enroll, found a shop, Green, who was in the subject, advised him to drop-guide, because he needed a person who would receive the goods in America.  Using the proxy of the same state and city where the drop lived, he himself inserted a card in the shop and made an order, changing the name and address of the cardholder to the info of this person.  Black was very worried and was sure that nothing would work out.  So it happened. <br><br>  The cardholder called the bank, and the shop gave a decline.  Drop burned and wrote that he passed all the logs to the police. <br><br>  For more than a month, a novice carder sat on treason and waited for him to come.  But no one showed up, and eventually Black realized that no one needed him.  At this stage, for sure, and maybe in general. <br><br>  When a conscience began to speak, Black recalled the excuse Green shared with him. <br><br>  “What are you worried about?  In fact, carders do no real harm to anyone.  All the money that you have withdrawn from the card, the bank will return it to the holder.  Insurance funds all cover.  This is how the system works.  In general, do not bother your head with nonsense. " <br><br>  Black was jealous of his calm, he could not.  But he liked the money now.  Just at that time, he met Ira, and there was much to spend them on. <br><br>  Over time, Black found out that Stills was also associated with carding.  He still hated him, so the news that Red found a bug on the site made him very happy.  Fantasies of revenge began to emerge in his head, which he scrolled during these years. <br><br>  *** <br><br>  Before you unsubscribe to Red, Black decided to calm down a bit.  He was too agitated.  My heart began to pound fast. <br>  Seems to be played again by the IRR. <br>  We must wash. <br>  He entered the bath and turned on the cold water and put his hands under the stream.  Cool. <br>  Black closed his eyes, trying to collect thoughts.  I wanted to smoke. <br>  “Eating something will be easier.” <br>  Not. <br>  Excitement did not allow more delay, and taking a towel, he went to the computer. <br>  Turned on ICQ and immediately fell down the window with messages sent to it offline.  Black found where nick Red was glowing. <br><br>  “Red (22:55:23 05/05/2005): <br>  I hacked it !!!  I thought everything. " <br><br>  “Red (22:55:57 05/11/2005): <br>  what will we do next?  can we remember the old days and zadefefsim? " <br><br>  A black smile appeared on Black's face.  Now that the Stills project has become much more popular and serious, it would be quite funny to report to the network what happened.  Hate and resentment, as is usually the case, began to interfere with sober thinking.  He would be glad to do any dirty trick, all the more so noticeable.  The memories of the visit to the department K, how Steeles passed it the last time, became brighter and brighter. <br>  While he was thinking, a message came from Red, who saw that Black had appeared online. <br><br>  “Red (10:56:33 05/05/2005): <br>  well, like this?  What we shall do??" <br><br>  Now they risked again, and fear began to slowly overshadow other emotions. <br>  In fact, there was no need for a deface, if Red really managed to merge the base, you can try to collect compromising evidence on Stills, his logins, passwords.  Come up with more serious revenge.  You don’t even have to go to the police, you can ruin your life in other ways. <br>  Black began to reflect on the fact that this is really good luck.  Many are looking for vulnerabilities on the Stills website, but this is not so easy, everything has been fixed a long time ago.  And here, Red managed it. <br>  "I wonder how." <br><br>  "Black (22:58:00 05/05/2005): <br>  How did you find the bug?  Himself? " <br><br>  He did not consider his friend stupid, but he understood that Red had not been engaged in hacking for a long time, and he hardly fuss.  There was an inscription that Red is typing a message, but no answer came.  Black wrote again. <br><br>  "Black (22:59:40 05/05/2005): <br>  I do not believe that you yourself found it.  Come on, c00lh4k3r R3d! ” <br><br>  “Black (23:00:02 05/11/2005): <br>  ? <br><br>  No reaction.  He began to worry.  After 15 minutes, the window flashed. <br><br>  “Red (23:15:20 05/11/2005): <br>  you better not know " <br><br>  “Well, no, to write right away, he will now pull at midnight,” recalled the habits of Red Black.  - "Well, at least not offended." <br><br>  “Black (23:15:58 05/11/2005): <br>  ? <br><br>  Silence.  Red did not answer, and Black thought that he was probably too harsh when a message arrived. <br><br>  “Red (23:22:20 05/11/2005): <br>  your psycho mar wrote me about this vulnerability.  the type wants to help us and all that.  count up.  no matter who it is, thanks to him !! ” <br><br>  At first, Black did not believe what he saw.  Reread again. <br>  “Mar?” - consciousness screamed that it was bad.  "Why does this maniac do all this, what does he want?" <br><br>  “Black (23:23:03 05/11/2005): <br>  , kzlm htl ns cjdctv ht [yekcz &amp;&amp;&amp; " <br><br>  For anger forgot to switch the layout. <br>  “Some kind of nonsense,” he mused. <br>  Hands began to shake again.  He got up from his chair and began to walk around the room, inhaling deeply.  There was a feeling of lack of air.  Black opened the wide open window. <br>  Having calmed down a little, I returned to the computer. <br><br>  "Black (23:30:33 05/11/2005 <br>  Are you a drug addict?  Has the roof gone down completely? ” <br><br>  “Black (23:30:57 05/11/2005): <br>  I told you about this mara. ” <br><br>  “Black (23:31:45 05/05/2005): <br>  What are you all " <br><br>  “Black (23:32:50 05/11/2005): <br>  We do not know what he thought.  This can be a substitute <br><br>  Black with anger began to make typos.  He continued to bang. <br>  “How can you be so stupid?” He asked himself, “This is all Red.  Not at all thinking about the consequences. ” <br>  Black was scared.  Now he is really scared. <br>  From the beginning, someone finds out about his hacking, somehow gets his passport data, drives with a suspicious girl, says that he is watching him, and knows everything, now he is still helping them to hack the Stilts website. <br>  What for?  And how does he know so much about him?  Maybe all this is a setup, they want Black to be captured, to be put in prison.  After all, now Stills again, as at that time, can pass it.  What is stopping him?  Surely, Stills will be enough to talk to the right people, and they will tie him up, as there is nothing to do, and why they will find him. <br><br>  “Black (23:38:20 05/11/2005): <br>  Please tell me you didn’t have time to do anything noticeable. ” <br><br>  Asking the question, Black realized how unlikely it was, he knew his friend too well to believe in his sound thinking and patience. <br><br>  “Red (23:40:04 05/05/2005): <br>  late" <br><br>  “Red (23:40:54 05/11/2005): <br>  I posted their database on the Internet and left a message from us: / " <br><br>  “Black (23:41:05 05/05/2005): <br>  What ??  Are you crazy?  Fuck the message, then?  How old are you" <br><br>  “Black (23:41:55 05/11/2005): <br>  Did you forget what happened last time ?! ” <br><br>  “Red (23:42:07 05/05/2005): <br>  don't worry about it.  he will not do anything.  for this is not imprisoned.  just a joke" <br><br>  Black turned off ICQ.  "What an idiot you are," he answered in Red's mind.  But there was no further desire to talk further with him and explain something.  He was tired of constantly trying to sensitize a friend. <br>  It was useless. <br><br>  *** <br><br>  Black lay down on the bed and closed his eyes.  Surprisingly, but today he dreamed of not at all the usual nightmares, where he was imprisoned, interrogated or cut off his fingers in punishment for hacking, he saw Alina.  The girl with whom he was brought by a maniac. <br>  It was one of those dreams, waking up after which, with you there is a feeling of joy.  You can not even remember the exact content, but the soul warms happiness.  That is exactly what Black came to in the morning. <br><br>  *** <br><br>  He was awakened by a phone call.  It was Green.  He said he wanted to talk seriously. <br>  At noon, they were sitting in a cafe. <br>  “Cool number,” Green pointed out the black car. <br>  He always paid attention to the numbers.  Black remembered this friend's habit well.  Beautiful icq number, car, phone, Black was sure if Green needed to buy himself a fake passport, then surely with a beautiful date of birth. <br>  “100,” Green continued to admire. <br>  - Yes, yes, when will you finally get tired of this?  It seems to have matured already. <br>  - Never, this is impossible. <br>  Black grinned, he himself understood that this is only possible if the world ends, and Green simply has nothing to look at. <br>  Tanned, well dressed.  With his appearance, gestures and everything else, for which the first impression about a person is usually made, he didn’t look like a hacker at all.  In fact, he was not them for a long time. <br>  A child of rich parents who never knew what money problems are.  Black sometimes wondered why he was doing this at all. <br>  “Dear ...”, he thought, looking at his friend’s watch. <br>  Green was very different from him with Red.  Despite the fact that they had a small age difference, Black always treated him as more experienced.  With some exaggerated respect. <br>  Black guessed why Green called him, it was evident that he was unhappy.  When the silence was prolonged, he uttered. <br>  - You wanted to talk about something. <br>  “What you’ve done to Stealth’s site is unwise,” Green frowned. <br>  "Well, it began," Black said, upset that he was right. <br>  - You called me for it? <br>  - Not only.  You know, Black, a good carder or hacker would prefer not to glow.  Do you understand what I mean? <br>  Black nodded, he was aware of this himself, but decided to listen to a friend, who seemed to enjoy teaching. <br>  - Today everyone will be just what to say about your sink.  I do not understand why it was reported that you did it?  Do you need such fame?  What do you want from life, Black?  Bathe in cheap glory or make money?  What is in the first place for you? <br>  “Money,” he said, without hesitation. <br>  “So why the hell are you doing this?”  Understand, Stiles - he is no longer the last person in the world of carders, they trust him, and who are you ?!  You are nobody! <br>  - Do not you think that you are going too far?  - Black was offended at the insult. <br>  He felt unpleasant, because in fact he was not to blame, but Red, but he did not want to justify himself by accusing him of everything else, and Black decided to listen. <br>  Green turned away.  He was silent for several minutes, wondering if he was picking up the right words to better give a thought. <br>  Smoked. <br>  It was the exact opposite of Red.  Green never hurried. <br>  - Understand, Black, you are my friend.  And I want to help you.  If you are your own enemy, then I am powerless here, the choice is still yours. <br>  Here it is.  Said it suddenly and bluntly.  What can be objected to such a statement? <br>  - Choose Black.  Either you have been engaged in this nonsense all your life and have fame as a hacker, or you take on the mind. <br>  Black sipped his coffee. <br>  He understood that Green was right, that it was too unwise even without taking into account that some maniac had helped them with burglary. <br>  "Yes.  I can imagine you say, knowing the whole story, ”thought Black with some sort of gloating. <br>  - Um.  I will correct, - he said. <br>  - I know.  If I had not seen the potential in you, I would not advise.  How are you doing? <br>  Black was embarrassed, things have been going badly lately.  Working with carders was not as easy as it seemed.  Although he managed to earn, but in the past six months, he has already been thrown several times.  Everything was very inconstant. <br>  - My advice to you, do not trust anyone, - as if having read his thoughts, said Green, - This is a cruel business, each only for himself.  But still, do at least something, just do not waste time on idiocy, like the one you gave yesterday with Red. <br>  - Good.  I realized - Black was already starting to get angry.  It is unpleasant when you are undeservedly reprimanded. <br>  “But at the same time, do not forget that to think in a pattern is the surest way to bring the case down,” Green continued. “I think the person I just quoted quoted knew what he was talking about. <br>  - What does this have to do with it? <br>  - With that, if you want to achieve something in carding, business, anywhere, you have to understand, the main thing is to invent ideas yourself and not go by generally accepted ways, only this way you can rise to the very top, everything else is a struggle for a place pork trough.  Nobody pokes your finger, that here you will earn a lot.  Everyone wants to find some really profitable topic, someone succeeds, he raises decent money, but then it disappears and you have to look for a new one. <br>  - Good.  I will take your advice, have you philosophized something, are you starting a business training or something?  Do you do stuff? ”Said Black, grinning.  - How are you doing then? <br>  It became obvious from Green's face, he realized that he had achieved his goal, so the guy gladly switched to a conversation about himself. <br>  - By the way, infobusiness is a good idea, you need to think, - he smiled, - And so, everything is fine, we are working.  I decided to do some domains. <br>  - Domains? <br>  - Yes, why.  You have no idea how profitable this investment is. <br>  - Are you talking about the names of sites that anyone can register?  Where is the benefit? <br>  “Ha, how naive you are,” Green laughed, who clearly enjoyed being the speaker in the conversation. “The fact of the matter is that these are short icq numbers that anyone could register before, and how I traded them do you remember? <br>  Green smiled like a man immersed in pleasant memories. <br>  - Beautiful short domain names are engaged, with time they appear in demand.  For zone ru it is still relevant.  Cybersquatting is a good topic.     ?           2000,       .
