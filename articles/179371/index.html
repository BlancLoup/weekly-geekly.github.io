  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Some statistics on email marketing</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  With this post we open the blog <a href="http://pechkin-mail.ru/">of the email-marketing service Pechkin-mail.ru</a> on Habr√©.  We did not dare to do this for a long time, because  believed that we have nothing to give the Habrasoobschestvu other than popiaritsya.  But for one and a half years of work, we have accumulated knowledge that will be useful to all IT shnik, one way or another, associated with email-mailings.  We will publish both statistical and technical information about the work of our service.  In the first post, we will tell and show our statistics on email discoveries and statistics of the Runet email providers, which we have accumulated during this time from hundreds of our clients. <br><br><h4>  Statistics of the discovery of letters on Pechkin </h4><br>  Letter discovery is one of the most important parameters for mailing success.  We are often asked - ‚ÄúWhy is this newsletter opened 40% of subscribers.  The rest of it, did not get it?  Have you all sent? ‚Äù.  We look at the size of the address database of this client, we see that it amounts to&gt; 10,000 subscribers and ‚Äúfalls into the draft‚Äù, because this is an extremely high distribution efficiency.  In this case, we immediately ‚Äúmark‚Äù this newsletter and prepare it for publication as a super-case on which we can show how to work with subscribers.  And why do we do this?  Yes, because the average percentage of discoveries on this size of address bases is 12.06%. <br><img title="Email discovery statistics on email marketing service Pechkin-mail.ru" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d62/924/395/d62924395f46fb0025c55a0a06f39b02.png"><br>  In the screenshot above, we see the dependence of the opening of email mailings on the size of the address bases for which they were sent. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

      <br>
    <h4>  The proportion of discoveries depending on the time after posting. </h4><br><br>  Well, we figured out the total percentage of opening of letters, but how to understand its dynamics?  How do letters open during delivery?  Our experience shows that, despite the seemingly ‚Äúantediluvian‚Äù email-mailing as a communication tool, it is quite operative ‚Äî half of all email discoveries are made within 8 hours, and in the first 24 hours - almost 75%. <br><img title="The share of discoveries, depending on the time after mailing on the email-marketing service Pechkin-mail.ru" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e1a/568/6ae/e1a5686ae0c4d8104e856b4af8d6382f.png"><br>  According to the latest data, the review of which we will try to post in the near future, more and more users are using email on mobile devices.  Therefore, the rate of e-mails opening within 30 minutes (at the moment it is just over 15%) will only grow in the coming years. <br><br><h4>  The percentage of opening letters during the day </h4><br>  Another question from customers: ‚ÄúWhen is the best time to send an email newsletter?‚Äù.  The question is interesting and the statistics, which was given above, can partly answer it, but for 100% of the answer we can give some more information for consideration. <br><img title="The percentage of opening letters during the day on the service of email-marketing Pechkin-mail.ru" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9b9/22f/f39/9b922ff396ed2ed341bea35972a5efb2.png"><br>  As can be seen on the graph, the percentage of opening of letters is fairly uniform during the working day.  We gave the results to the local time of the recipient of the letter (if possible) or the local time of the sender, since  Our clients are ‚Äúspread out‚Äù throughout Russia from Khabarovsk to Kaliningrad.  Definitely, you should not send a newsletter at 3 am, if you want your newsletter read immediately. <br><br><h4>  Statistics on mail providers Runet </h4><br>  Recently, for our clients, we have introduced summary statistics for various mail domains, so that we can track how emails are opened on a particular mail service, where there are more discoveries, clicks or formal replies from mailings.  While these statistics are going, we can simply provide information about which email providers are popular in RuNet. <br><img title="Distribution of email providers by statistics on the email marketing service Pechkin-mail.ru" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/89b/949/451/89b9494514abbdeeee2bc1cedfcb24d1.png"><br>  Total variety of domains - 497,418 pieces. <br><br><h6>  Why do we need this information for senders? </h6><br>  Often we are asked the question: ‚ÄúI just can‚Äôt go through a spam filter on my gmail box, whereas Mail.ru and Yandex are ok, what should I do?‚Äù.  We look at the client‚Äôs address database and see that his share of gmail is &lt;1% - and the answer is simply ‚ÄúScore‚Äù.  Gmail's spam filters are one of the toughest, and mostly filtering by content.  Why waste your time and energy by 1%?  When we select statistics on this mail provider in terms of openings, clicks, unsubscribes from mailings, as well as conversions (if GA is connected to a client), we can show that it‚Äôs even more meaningless to spend your time on this mail provider unless a gmail audience oriented company (what kind of audience we are looking at in the following articles).  So far, we see that for the bulk of our customers, it is important to pay attention to the correctness of displaying the mailing in Mail.ru and Yandex.Mail when preparing the newsletter. <br><br><h5>  Some announcements </h5><br>  In the coming months, a number of interesting articles will appear in this blog, telling about our ‚Äúkitchen‚Äù, about the development process, statistics in email marketing and much more.  Here is a list of upcoming publications: <br><ul><li>  What algorithms and what tools are best to use when creating text versions of letters from HTML? </li><li>  How do we use Amazon EC2 for arbitrary horizontal service scalability? </li><li>  How does an automated spam detection system work? </li><li>  Accounting technology clicks, discoveries, clicks "is spam", returns, and so on. </li><li>  Pechkin in numbers - what is being an email marketing service? </li></ul><br>  We will be glad to see you among our subscribers! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/179371/">https://habr.com/ru/post/179371/</a></p>
