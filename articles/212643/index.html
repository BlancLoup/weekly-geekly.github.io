      <br>
      First, the prehistory. <br>  I have never attached particular importance to my physical development and it seemed to me rather boring to spend my time playing sports.  I thought that my form was in the normal range and sex was enough to burn extra calories.  And I really didn‚Äôt really think about the sport before the age of 30 and a little.  But gradually, dissatisfaction with his body accumulated, and I remember the turning point well.  That day I bought a large double wardrobe in IKEA, brought it home and tried to assemble it.  After 6 hours, I was lying on the floor, breathing hard, and thought that I was no longer a teenager and absolutely had to reconsider my attitude towards physical development. <br><br>  Since I love games, and my work is connected with games, then I will use game terms.  I apologize in advance to those who find it inappropriate. <br><br>  Let's start with ‚Äúmaximizing the benefits.‚Äù <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  I try to systematically approach the things that are important to me and therefore, for some time I studied the theory of the question.  As a result, I identified three main ways.  Conventionally, they can be divided into casual, midcore and hardcore.  Casual is a swimming pool, running, roller skates, group classes, sports, yoga, etc.  Midkor is a rocking chair, and hardcore is a rocking chair + farm.  Kezhaul option seemed very tempting, but was regretfully rejected for poor performance.  Yes, this is quite fun, but achieving the same physical form takes an order of magnitude more time than with strength training.  Those who plan to participate in the competition, or, for example, actors who urgently need to be pumped up for the role in the film, use the hardcore version, but the pharma in my eyes has too many drawbacks: the pharma affects the fragile hormonal balance of the body, requires constant monitoring by the doctor and testing, bad for the emotional sphere and not quite legal.  Assessing all the pros and cons, I chose midkor option. <br><br>  I was immediately lucky and, on my first rocking ride, I met a great coach (Dima, hello).  He imbued with the seriousness of my intentions and undertook to help me.  The first four months were very hard.  Both physically and mentally.  I survived only thanks to the professionalism of the coach.  He gave large but acceptable for me load and supported psychologically, simultaneously dispelling many myths carried by casuals.  Most people think that their form will begin to improve from the first lesson, expose themselves to extreme loads and quickly drop without getting a result.  In fact, it only takes a few months to learn how to do the exercises correctly and develop the necessary endurance.  The next revelation for me was that the direct path does not work.  In order to lose weight (ie, get rid of fat), you must first gain muscle mass (ie, visually grow fat), and only then you can begin active fat loss. <br><br>  Here is a slightly simplified picture of how the body works.  Energy (calories) is spent on the maintenance of life and physical activity.  If more calories are consumed with food than it is consumed, then some of the excess is stored as fat.  This mechanism emerged as a result of evolution and allowed people to survive in periods of famine.  And if at the moment the problem of hunger has receded into the background, then the ancient schemes laid down in us have nothing to do with this.  Therefore, most of the effort is actually spent on ‚Äúdeceiving‚Äù the body.  It would seem that you can limit the flow of calories and then the fat will not accumulate.  This is not entirely true.  If the consumption of calories more than comes with food, then the body needs somewhere to fill the gap.  Part of the energy (small) of course will be taken from the accumulated fat, but nature has arranged so much that first of all the body will get rid of the most useless and energy-intensive, namely muscles.  What are muscles needed for?  If you look from the point of view of calorie consumption, this is the only (well, almost) our parameter that we can influence.  If we want to significantly increase our metabolism (energy consumption), then we need a lot of muscle.  Thus, building up muscle mass and not allowing fat to accumulate, we can gradually shift the balance towards good shape.  In practice, it is not the simultaneous pumping and fat burning that is more effective, but the cycles of weight gain and drying. <br><br>  So, after a few months I got used to three workouts a week and began to build muscle mass.  The case was moving badly, and I began to think about how to improve the efficiency of this process.  And here the food came to the fore.  As I said in the previous paragraph, it is very important that the amount of nutrients entering the body match its needs as precisely as possible.  It turns out that it can be calculated.  There are formulas that take into account different parameters such as weight, height, and so on.  There are devices that measure metabolism.  It does not matter where to start, since we will get the exact values ‚Äã‚Äãa little later.  Knowing your approximate daily calorie consumption, you can go further, namely, to count how much protein, fat and carbohydrates you need to eat every day.  For muscle growth, it is recommended to eat from 2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight.  Fat at a minimum, 1 gram per kilogram of body weight and less, and the rest of carbohydrates.  By the way, it turned out that fats are also needed for the normal functioning of the body, although it was tempting not to eat them at all.  Having received three numbers, I tried to correlate them with real products.  After tormenting a few days with calculations on a piece of paper, I asked the trainer whether it was possible to somehow simplify this process, if there is any special software about this?  He said that most athletes use a rather limited menu, literally 3-4 products, and therefore it‚Äôs not so difficult for them to find the exact amount to eat their standard.  I tried.  For a couple of weeks I had enough, my diet consisted of chicken breast, rice, cottage cheese and oatmeal.  I decided that my willpower is quite a finite quantity and I am not ready to subject it to such tests.  It was necessary to somehow diversify their food, without reducing the effectiveness of the diet.  A little googling, I was not surprised to find a convenient tool that would solve this problem.  Of course, there were many applications to account for the products eaten, but they did not give any bonuses compared to the counting on the piece of paper.  The big disadvantage of such a system was that I practically could not eat out.  Any trip to a restaurant or cafe, in the middle of the working day, completely crossed out the planned diet.  It was necessary to be able to quickly make adjustments to the planned menu, based on the availability of certain dishes and products. <br><br>  The ideal solution was a mobile application that would contain a list of products with information about the amount of nutrients, allow you to quickly edit this list, add or decrease the amount of each product, and instantly reduce the daily balance.  Almost immediately, the idea came to realize this in the form of a list of sliders (by the number of products).  The user can move one of the sliders, and the application adjusts the position of the others, but so that the total amount of proteins, fats and carbohydrates throughout the list exactly matches the plan.  The problem was reduced to solving a simple system of linear equations, with some restrictions on the domain of solutions.  So the first version of the dietographer appeared. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/84a/b82/bb2/84ab82bb2bc0b95255ec00f6534d9001.gif"><br><br>  The application was made, as they say, for themselves, so it looked a little different then.  However, I and my trainer very quickly appreciated the convenience and speed of diet planning in the dietographer, and gradually relatives, friends and other visitors of the gym joined the circle of initiates.  Testing and improvements took more than a year.  In the process, many interesting details emerged.  For example, what is the glycemic index and how fast carbohydrates differ from slow ones, why not all proteins are the same, and that fats are saturated and unsaturated, and which ones are useful.  The application interface has been dramatically improved in all aspects, and the solver has become much smarter.  At some point I got tired of sending invitations to TestFlight and I decided that Dietograph is ready to be uploaded to the appstore. <br><br>  After I started to control the diet, some results appeared, looking ahead, I can say that I managed to gain 10 kg of meat in six months, which is quite good for my weight (before the start of classes there were 62 kg, and at the end of weight gain It became 76 kg, for beginners it happens).  And getting the achivka ‚Äúrelief press‚Äù took me about a year (and two cycles with drying). <br><br>  If someone decides to repeat my method, I‚Äôll tell you a few life hacks.  Since finding out the exact individual value of daily calorie consumption is rather difficult, an iterative method will do.  First you need to calculate the value of one of the three formulas (button ‚Äúmetabolism calculator‚Äù), either found on the Internet or ask your trainer.  Then you need to enter the data into the daily diet calculator and carefully follow this diet for a couple of weeks, while weighing in every 2-3 days.  If the weight falls, then you need to eat more and more often, if it grows, then you can eat less.  You need to add and subtract gradually, no more than 200-300 calories per week.  The body is a rather inertial thing, so almost always you have to wait a couple of weeks to notice the changes.  If the weight has stabilized, then we have found the desired values ‚Äã‚Äãand you can choose what to do next, for example, to gain mass.  By the way, I was seriously undernourished to my standard when I was guided by my feelings and appetite.  In general, this is quite a counter-intuitive thing, you can not fully trust yourself in this matter, it is better to just count.  Another funny fact is that an untrained person is completely unable to assess the weight of products by eye, the error is usually up to 50%, which completely deprives the diet of meaning.  Therefore, weigh all products (at least until the eye is developed). <br><br>  It is very important to eat evenly throughout the day.  The more meals the better.  It is necessary, as it were, to convince the body that hunger does not threaten it and there is no point in putting off supplies for a rainy day.  Muscle growth also requires a constant flow of nutrients, so many athletes eat protein foods before bedtime, and some even wake up at night specifically to drink a protein shake. <br><br>  Just in case, I repeat that the diet only makes sense in conjunction with sports.  Individually, it does not work. <br><br>  So, let's say you want to do strength training and diet.  Suppose you do not have (like me) special genetic bonuses or penalties to the constitution, and you want to achieve visible results in a year.  What should you be ready for?  First of all it is expenses.  Spending time and money. <br><br>  First, it takes time to workout.  I stopped at three classes in the gym a week.  More than three no longer gives noticeable bonuses (excluding the drying period, of course).  Total, get to the hall, work out (an hour and a half), then hitch (20 minutes), shower and drive back.  Can not skip.  At all.  Personally, I have one lesson with the road takes about 3 hours.  Secondly, a huge amount of time will be occupied by the preparation and absorption of food.  An ordinary person can eat a big bag on the way home and drink it with beer.  It will not suit you.  You will have to plan at least four meals a day in advance, and then painfully push yourself into this huge amount of food.  If cooking can handle a wife or a slow cooker, then you have to eat it all yourself.  I think you can safely evaluate all this at 3 o'clock, every day.  Total 3 * 3 + 7 * 3 = 30 hours per week. <br><br>  As for the money, I will try to calculate the approximate budget on the example of St. Petersburg.  A subscription to the gym can cost from 5,000 to 35,000 rubles a year.  Dear hall does not give any bonuses for pumping, but it can be more comfortable or just closer to home.  Personal training.  For beginners, it's just ‚Äúa must‚Äù.  I believe that it is absolutely impossible to learn how to do the exercises correctly and calculate the program without having the appropriate experience.  You will simply waste your time or even harm yourself.  A good coach will be able to protect you from injury, to optimize the load in real time and help psychologically.  In addition, working with a coach, much more likely not to quit and hold out this year.  Personal training costs a lot, 500-1500 rubles for one lesson.  In the year you need to buy 30-150 workouts.  The next item of expenditure is food.  If carbohydrates and fats are relatively cheap, then high-quality protein food costs decent money.  Well, if you can eat chicken breasts all year round (100-200 rubles per kilogram), but if you want variety, beef is more expensive (up to 400 rubles), and fresh tuna can cost 500-700 rubles.  If you have to dine in a cafe, you can safely multiply all prices by 2 or 3. For a character weighing 75 kg, about 150 grams per day is required.  protein, and this amount is contained in about 750 grams of meat or cottage cheese. <br>  Take the mean values ‚Äã‚Äãand sum up over the year. <br><br>  Subscription: 20 000 rubles. <br>  Trainer: 1000 * 90 = 90,000 rubles. <br>  Food: 300 * 365 = 109 500 rubles. <br>  Appendix ‚ÄúDietograf‚Äù: 329 rubles. <br><br>  Total: 219 829 rubles. <br><br>  Of course, I didn‚Äôt take everything into account here, but someone will find ways to save money, but speaking seriously, this project has a rather serious budget.  On the other hand, if you approach the business not with full dedication, then you will need many times more time to achieve the same results (if at all).  Therefore, even in terms of money, it makes sense to plow in full, not to mention irreplaceable time. <br><br>  For those readers who have mastered this wall of the text, I want to summarize some results.  The theme of sports and nutrition is truly huge and rich in holivars.  It would be foolish to claim the ultimate truth.  However, this is my personal and experienced experience.  All the techniques and techniques described above actually work and show good efficiency, which was tested on himself and several other volunteers.  In addition, numerous consultations with experts convinced me that all this is completely safe for health. <br><br>  As for the application, it is made for iPhone and iPod, written in a mixture of C ++ and ObjC, so I don‚Äôt have any idea how to port it to android or WP, unless rewritten.  The application is paid for several reasons.  Firstly, I want to recoup the costs of design and other direct costs, and secondly, people value much less for free (I can say that if I found such an application when I started to play sports, then I wouldn't regret the amount an order of magnitude greater).  Thirdly, the price of the application is ridiculous next to the rest of the cost of sports.  However, if religion or other factors do not allow you to use paid applications, then I am ready to send promotional codes to the first 50 people who applied, but with the condition to send me a report on your personal experience of pumping, say, in six months. <br><br>  Link: <br>  <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/dietograph-pro-diet-planner/id808769413%3Fmt%3D8">itunes.apple.com/en/app/dietograph-pro-diet-planner/id808769413?mt=8</a> <br><br>  I will be glad to answer questions from readers. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/212643/">https://habr.com/ru/post/212643/</a></p>
