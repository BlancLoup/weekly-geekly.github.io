In the 21st century, this process, as a rule, takes place in a much calmer, even in a chamber environment.  Thanks to the development of technology, traders have long gone online. <br><br>  Now trading on the stock exchange can not be imagined without sophisticated software using sophisticated algorithms, as well as ultrafast iron.  However, despite the impressive growth of algorithmic and automated trading on the global financial markets, still a sufficient number of traders prefer to make operations on the stock exchanges themselves.  But this does not mean that such trading has not changed under the influence of technology - today we will talk about which gadgets are used to optimize it. <a name="habracut"></a>

    <h4>  TraderTools Keyboard </h4><br>  <a href="http://www.keyboardtrader.com/pricing.html">Keyboard Trader</a> is one of the most obvious solutions for online trading.  At first glance, the device differs from the usual keyboard except with multi-colored buttons.  However, the main feature of the device is the optionalness of these buttons.  They can be added or removed at their discretion, as well as programmed for any functions.  And for the keys there is a special <a href="http://www.keyboardtrader.com/KeyCatalog.pdf">catalog</a> , which lists the sizes, design and prices of the keys.  For example, if a trader needs a button to cancel all his requests to buy or sell stocks with one click, he will need to find the item ‚Äúcansel offers‚Äù in the catalog - the button costs $ 1. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0da/a06/423/0daa06423dbb4613a99379c37f3c1d31.png"><br><br><h4>  TradeMaster </h4><br>  More compact, but less functional option.  <a href="http://www.trademaster.com/">From TradeMaster</a> , which is a platform for online trading, when registering at a resource and opening an account for a certain amount, you can get a free little gadget that speeds up the entry of trading teams: buy, sell, cancel the operation, and so on. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/131/970/f15/131970f152e84a8c852073610add3782.png"><br><br>  There are quite a lot of similar tools that can be used for online trading: even with a superficial search, you can find a dozen options, their detailed descriptions and cost.  For example, <a href="http://www.weytec.com/ru/produkty/klaviatury-wey/klaviatura-mk06/osnovnye-osobennosti/">WEY MK06 / RAY06</a> or <a href="http://store.artlebedev.ru/electronics/optimus-popularis/">Optimus Popularis</a> released by Art. Lebedev Studio. <br><br>  However, many traders are not limited to keyboards alone. <br><br><h4>  What else </h4><br>  Many traders love to use gaming gadgets, which is quite logical: as in games, in trading, speed of reaction, speed of decision making in a limited time are important.  Therefore, in this area, devices that can be programmed for certain functions are appreciated, and it is desirable that all buttons be located on a gadget very compactly. <br><br><h5>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Logitech-910-000173-G9-Laser-Mouse/dp/B000UHE8Y2">Logitech g9</a> </h5><br>  Or any computer mouse for gamers will fit this description.  Many buttons are easy to program for the desired functions.  As a result, the mouse can, to a certain extent, play the role of a mini-keyboard.  The main thing to remember which button is responsible for what. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/258/488/287/2584882870b7448ab3e24d1ee07f25e1.png"><br><br>  In the same way, any gamepad that is popular with fans of action and MMORPG is suitable for trading.  Moreover, some traders use even joysticks for such tasks. <br><br>  Here is the relevant <a href="http://forum.2stocks.ru/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D8897%26hl%3D%2525E4%2525E6%2525EE%2525E9%2525F1%2525F2%2525E8%2525EA%26st%3D20">discussion</a> in one of the core communities, whose members used the <a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/Saitek-Wireless-P2900-PC-Gamepad-w-Battery-Works-Tested-/201579082791%3Fhash%3Ditem2eef0cb427:g:6g0AAOSw3mpXLZxJ">Saitek P2900 Wireless Rumble Pad</a> for trading.  The principle here is the same as in the case of specialized keyboards - all the buttons are near, they can be programmed, and the absence of wires gives more freedom of movement. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/715/548/e41/715548e412f04afebef4f52cdb6f3bc3.png"><br><br>  After the trader has picked up the necessary gadgets, it is important to properly organize your work space.  We found several examples of how the desktops of traders look like.  The first thing that catches your eye is a large number of monitors. <br><br><h4>  Why? </h4><br>  Firstly, this is due to the incredible flow of information that the user tracks every minute.  For example, a trader tracks information on the Korean Stock Exchange and the Stock Exchange in Tokyo.  Due to a large, constantly updated data array, the price line in Tokyo can go off the screen and the trader loses the information from view.  From this saves several monitors.  The traders themselves <a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-do-traders-have-so-many-Terminals-PC-Screens">say</a> that the most advanced of them use nine screens each, less experienced ones are content with four. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7b2/8f5/75d/7b28f575d6494573a5e3d9b472ea4d23.png"><br><br>  <i>British Trader Charles Lewis Desktop</i> <br><br>  Another reason why traders may need two or more monitors is to work with different computers.  For example, one can be connected to a computer on Linux, and the second on Windows.  And two different operating systems are needed by the trader, as they are used to work with software that solves different tasks from trading to communications. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/53e/cdb/083/53ecdb083cc847d7b75e59a614cd28a0.png"><br><br>  <i>The owner of this desktop has eight monitors.</i>  <i>Donald B. Cummings, Jr.</i>  <i>says that such a number of screens helps him organize data from different channels from different exchanges.</i>  <i>And he started with one laptop and one ipad.</i> <br><br>  The main reason why traders use multiple screens is speed.  Shift a look at a centimeter is much faster than checking a lot of windows through alt + tab.  Especially when information is updated every second. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ba8/3f7/669/ba83f76695844116ac84c2e78ee457a4.png"><br><br>  <i>Joan Farley Workplace</i>  <i>To increase the speed of work, he learned to work with two mice at the same time (one per hand)</i> <br><br>  In addition to computers and monitors, many traders allocate a separate budget for the purchase of uninterruptible power supply devices, since in the case of a surge in electricity, you can lose a round sum when you find yourself outside the suitable moment.  Here <a href="http://shevelev-trade.ru/istochnik-besperebojnogo-pitaniya">a</a> man who calls himself an ‚Äúaverage‚Äù trader recommends a model with a good price-performance ratio, <a href="http://www.dns-shop.ru/product/7fb7001abba252d7/ibp-ippon-back-power-pro-700/">ippon black power pro 700</a> . <br><br>  The same goes for internet connection.  In addition to the main communication channel, traders organize backup from other providers. <br><br>  In addition to gadgets, much attention is paid to software - trading applications are used in a very specific way, which is only the number of monitors on which data is broadcast.  Therefore, it is important that the software takes into account the conditions in which its users work - for example, the <a href="http://www.itinvest.ru/software/comp/smartx/">SmartX</a> terminal, which allows you to take out different windows (quotes, transactions, input orders) on different monitors. <br><br>  That's all for today.  If you know interesting gadgets that can be used for online trading, but are not included in our text - share links in the comments.
