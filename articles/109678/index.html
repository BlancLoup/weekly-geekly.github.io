We were often asked about this since the launch of Evernote two and a half years ago, probably because people are now loaded with information more than ever, and many of us can no longer draw a clear line between personal, family, professional and academic spheres of life.  Evernote helps to streamline this chaos, and now we have made it easier to attach entire commands to services.  This feature is <strong><a href="http://www.evernote.com/about/sponsor">sponsored Evernote accounts</a></strong> . <br><br><img title="settings" src="http://blog.evernote.com/ru/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/settings.png" width="600" height="604"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  What are sponsored accounts? </h3><br>  Sponsored accounts are an easy way to pay and manage <a href="http://www.evernote.com/premium">premium subscriptions</a> for groups of any size.  Any employee in your organization can take advantage of a premium subscription, and you get a single consolidated monthly bill.  But that is not all. <br><br>  <strong>Easy group management</strong> <br>  When you create a sponsored group, you get the opportunity to customize the welcome page, the link to which you will send to anyone you want to provide with a premium account.  You have the ability to approve and delete group members with a few mouse clicks.

You can pay as many accounts as you want with a credit card and get a single bill for the month for the whole group of five or more people. <br><br>  <strong>Priority technical support</strong> <br>  Requests for support from the owner or administrator of the sponsored group receive the highest priority in the queue. <br><br><h3>  Who owns the accounts? </h3><br>  Only Evernote users own their accounts.  Sponsorship <strong>does not give</strong> you ownership of their accounts, you simply pay them additional premium subscription options.  If you decide to suspend payment for an individual user, then his account will simply return to the status that he had before the start of the sponsorship: free or premium account, paid from his own funds. <br><br>  For users, joining a sponsored group does not mean losing any control over accounts.  If your premium account Evernote paid for the company you left, then all your notes you take with you.  The memories you save in Evernote remain with you forever. <br><br><h3>  Sponsorship and collaboration </h3><br>  Employers and other users who want to control the flow of information in their Evernote accounts can create their own corporate notebooks and give them access to team members as part of standard collaboration functionality.  Currently shared notebooks are available in the web interface and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/evernote/blog/109206//">Evernote beta for Mac,</a> but this feature will soon be implemented on other platforms.  We are also working to make this functionality more advanced and easier for sponsored groups.  This will allow you to quickly open access to the notebook for your team. <br><br><h3>  Discounts for sponsored accounts for educational institutions </h3><br>  Sponsored accounts for students and teachers around the world are offered at a 50% discount on the regular price. <br><br>  <strong>Example with an educational institution: Montclair Kimberly Academy</strong> <br>  <a href="http://www.mka.org/">Montclair Kimberly Academy</a> (MKA) is a private school in the American city of Montclair, New Jersey, whose experience can serve as an example of using the capabilities of sponsored Evernote accounts.  This school year, MKA launched a new program, providing every high school student a MacBook.  All laptops come with an Evernote software client and a premium subscription so students can use the service in many (if not all) classes.  Here is the video we shot at this school (in English): <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/5Ag_rlQL4IM%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhg6Wqsxj1dVJw4WgaQp7-evps_Fpw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h3>  Where to begin </h3><br>  If you are interested in using sponsored accounts in your organization, then open the Evernote web interface and click on the ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù link.  On the left side of the page that appears, there is now a new tab <a href="https://www.evernote.com/User.action%3FviewSponsorship%3Dtrue">‚ÄúSponsored Accounts‚Äù</a> .  Click on it to start setting.  Then select a payment method and, if desired, set up a welcome page for your group. <br><br>  You can learn more about sponsored accounts on a <a href="http://www.evernote.com/about/sponsor">special page</a> or by reading <a href="http://www.evernote.com/about/sponsor/faq.php">frequently asked questions about sponsored accounts</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/109678/">https://habr.com/ru/post/109678/</a></p>
