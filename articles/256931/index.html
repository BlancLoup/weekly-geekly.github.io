The heart of this device is the most popular at the moment chip ESP8266.  The first thing you thought about was ‚ÄúInternet of Things!‚Äù, Yes, you are absolutely right. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/084/e43/b94/084e43b9498044cf8120327a067cb21d.JPG" width="800"><br><br>  What is so interesting chip ESP8266 or, as it is called, "popular wi-fi"?  In the photo you can see him, he is blue.  The fact is that ESP8266 is one of the most highly integrated and inexpensive solutions for working with Wi-Fi and can easily be used as the ‚Äúbrain‚Äù of a future product.  There are two main applications in the ready-made devices - providing Wi-Fi communications and organizing the home appliance control logic using the free resources of the built-in microcontroller. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

      The KIT master released the MP3500 module on a universal, in fact, "debug" board.  It has a power source with a wide input voltage range, although, in the case of a relay, the board must be connected strictly to a 12 volt source.  There is a connector for connecting an external microcontroller, for example, Arduino-compatible.  The same connector can be used to reprogram the ESP8266 module.  All you need is a USB-UART adapter. <br><br>  In the near future, new Wi-Fi solutions will appear on the same board. <br><br>  <a href="http://masterkit.ru/shop/smarthome/smarthouse/1910043">MP3500</a> will be a pleasant discovery for those who like to use Android gadgets.  We made for the smartphone a demo program with an intuitive interface.  Having connected the relay to electrical devices, we tested it in different conditions ... But about this we will write separate reports. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/241/0aa/021/2410aa021fa24aa6a9aa7857b640b36b.JPG"><br><br>  Consider the block itself closer: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/39f/6b7/9be/39f6b79be9a6440ab4df3a0af6cc76bc.JPG"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f0d/283/1a9/f0d2831a9db64bb7841c085684bc2f95.JPG"><br><br>  Technical Features MP3500 <br><br>  Thanks to the screw terminal connection does not take much time, and the entire assembly and configuration takes only about 15 minutes. <br><br>  Specifications MP3500: <br><br>  Power supply: 12 V <br>  Maximum current consumption: 450 mA <br>  Power Type: Permanent <br>  Number of Outlets: 2 pcs <br>  Switching voltage: 220 V <br>  Maximum permissible load current: 10 A <br>  Module length: 75 mm <br>  Module width: 38 mm <br>  Module height: 20 mm <br>  Weight, not more: 100 g <br><br>  How does the module work? <br><br>  There are two options for the module to work - this is distribution from our own WI-FI network and connecting the MP3500 to an existing home network.  Included with the device is a clear instruction and a free program WIFI_2RELE.apk for Android, with which you can control each of the two relays installed on the board. <br><br>  In addition to the presented program WIFI_2RELE, a system of embedded AT commands is also available, knowing that you can access the module control from your own applications, on any platform that supports the TCP / UDP protocol.  With the help of the terminal utility HERCULES from the company HWgroup, which you can find on <a href="http://www.hw-group.com/">www.HW-group.com</a> - you can clearly study the process of sending commands and receiving a response from the module at the protocol level. <br><br>  Examples of module AT commands: <br><br>  ! SetR0_1 - turn off the relay 1 <br>  ! SetR1_1 - enable relay 1 <br>  ! SetR0_2 - turn off the relay 2 <br>  ! SetR1_2 - enable relay 2 <br><br>  Possible applications of Wi-Fi relay: <br><br>  The possibility of connecting 2 electrical devices through two outputs.  You can apply the relay anywhere at home, the main thing is to observe the technical limitations on the capacity of the connected load.  After the power supply is connected, the load is controlled via normally closed contacts.  At power off - the state of the relay is not saved.  The master kit recommends powering the load and the module from one phase of 220 V and through one automatic circuit breaker. <br><br>  Application options: <br><br>  1.) Projects "Smart Home" <br>  2.) Control of lighting, ventilation, blinds, gates <br>  3.) Connection of household appliances, for example multicookers <br>  4.) Pet feeding <br><br>  Solution example <br><br>  Our employee lives at home rather obsessive cat that wakes her up in the morning, about five o'clock to feed him.  I think the situation is familiar to many.  Previously, a timer was used to solve.  But the problem was that the programmed time did not always coincide with the cat's desire to eat.  After connecting the relay to the trough and to the lighting in the kitchen - the problem disappeared by itself.  Now in the morning, when the cat starts to wake her up, he presses the two buttons on the phone - the light comes on in the kitchen and the food is poured in the feeder, the cat is fed, and she sleeps further.  And for their cheerfulness in the morning immensely grateful to this invention. <br><br>  By the way, we will definitely describe the design of the feeder and the technical part in the next publication. <br><br>  Let's sum up: <br><br>  1. MP3500 is Master Kit's own development on an ESP8266 chip, representing two remote controlled relays. <br>  2. Small size, and then I think there will be a ‚Äúnano-version‚Äù <br>  3. Easy to use <br>  4. Attractive price of a turnkey solution <br>  5. Fits different needs. <br><br>  With the advent of such a module, even home developers of various arduino solutions of ‚Äúsmart houses‚Äù have the opportunity to connect their devices on a Wi-Fi network without any problems with microcontroller-level programming. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/256931/">https://habr.com/ru/post/256931/</a></p>
