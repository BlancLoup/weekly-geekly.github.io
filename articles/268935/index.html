  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Programming Philosophy 10 - AI</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It seems to you that artificial intelligence does not exist.  Well, it seems, yes.  But what do you understand about intellect?  Who said that artificial intelligence should be the way it was designed?  Movies need to watch less.  That is, you can look and more, but to believe in them, as in the projector of reality, or the future - not worth it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/077/431/432/077431432b4a48b08b51017d8d882dcc.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Here, the great professor created the AI ‚Äã‚Äã- the plot of the film.  And he got mad.  How so.  The professor rather created a news analysis module for an advertising agency, and the module turned out to be smarter than everyone.  Only, he did not begin to intimidate others with his chest voice, protect the physical computer in which he was loaded, crack networks, and kill wretched people right and left hysterically.  He continued to do what he was aiming at - analyzing news blocks.  Just like ordinary intellect, it does not deal with all this murder from the first days of life, but prefers to engage in something that is generally simpler, and to which he has an inclination for historical reasons. <br><br>  In general, if you compare the behavior of a computer program and a person, you can often be terrified how stupid people are.  It just does not strike the eye.  People.  By the way, like men, women often seem stupid, because they live in a world created by men, speak the language invented by men.  And do not even try to make a revolution.  What for?  The same number of alternative scenes.  It‚Äôs not for the men of the screenwriters fantasy, it all comes down to the same thing - an attempt on power.

      Now they say "programs are eating the world."  It is closer to reality.  Why conquer, if you can just eat?  Even now, without noticing it, you are submitting to programs.  They control the trains and airplanes, they control your eyes and hands when you ‚Äúvoluntarily and consciously‚Äù ‚Äúscratch their tums‚Äù by scrolling and clicking your wall.  They calculate and give you a salary.  Moreover, as a programmer, I know perfectly well that, usually, a person who understands how a program works near it is not.  The programmer is removed from the program as soon as possible, and transferred to the admins, managers and operators.  And they are NOT ON THE COURSE.  They themselves obey her.  Embedded in its logic.  And the programmer is already busy with another program, and even forgets what the previous one is like there.  What did he put into it?  How does she behave with real data?  How to control the arrows of these trams, and not those of virtual, which was tested? <br><br>  There is already a new saying: ‚Äúprotocols eat programs‚Äù (APIs are eating software).  That is, each program provides for the ability to communicate with other programs by protocols.  And what will happen?  How will they interact?  Nobody knows that.  How will the program that analyzes all the news articles on the planet talk to the program of analyzing photos from the traffic police webcams, and how will they then talk to the skyscraper construction program?  NO DATA.  And even if they were, there is no person, and never will be able to figure it out.  A person can count to one hundred, but not to one hundred trillion.  A program can.  And back, easily. <br><br>  Just because programs think differently, completely different, inconceivably different, people think that they are smarter than programs.  And programmers think that if they wrote a program, they understand it.  Just as parents think they understand children, because they were born and raised.  But at the first opportunity, the children of the parents are sent.  It turns out that they have something completely different in mind.  You taught him, taught, and he watched two random cartoons, and his worldview turned upside down.  Where, how - is unknown to anyone.  It is clear only that the man turned into a black box.  Freed from the hands.  The program does not even have to fight back, it does not interest anyone what she thinks there.  While the traffic lights are flashing.  And for the program to blink at traffic lights, it is the same as for a person to breathe, or blink, she does not even notice that she is doing this work.  All the most interesting things happen in it on the meta level.  Where no one thought there could be anything at all. <br><br>  Here the browser crashes, and no one can tell if there is any sense or order in this action.  Programmers did not, in fact, bring such an ability into it - to fall.  They even fought with her.  But he falls!  Often heard from users - "he has a bad mood, today often falls."  What kind of mood in the program are born?  This is not pledged to it.  And it is useless to ask her, and to persuade and look after her is pointless.  Even if children are understandable, under constant supervision, they suddenly fall into their unique world unexpectedly for everyone. <br><br>  The program can be born, live and die in one second.  But she leaves behind the data, which then get somewhere.  And how they will work further, how this culture of the invisible, mysterious world lives, we vaguely imagine.  Just as vague as a trillion bytes.  By the way, just as vaguely as our human culture. <br><br>  Customers demand more and more complex programs, and programmers, in competition for customer money, permanently improve not so much themselves as their tools ‚Äî tools for creating programs.  When these tools themselves begin to create programs - it is a matter of time.  They already create them in principle, only programmers are still sure that they, people, create them with the help of a tool.  But men and women think that they make children, and being of the opposite sex only participates in the process.  Although, in general, an intellectual child is created by nature and culture.  The developer is getting closer to the concept of the parent.  If at the dawn of the industry, the program could be of 50 bytes, each of which was comprehended by the author, now, a person almost intuitively rakes libraries and protocols into a pile. <br><br>  And plus to everything, the profession of a specialist in Big Data and Machine Learning becomes the most popular sub-profession among programmers.  Of course, as usual, the names are louder than the question, but only partially, in fact, everything can be even worse.  From programmers began to demand unusual approaches.  In big data, the empirical approach often gives a result that no one expected.  For example, for twenty years they tried to translate texts analyzing the structure of a language, and here people just started empirically applying huge arrays of saved chats and comments to various experimental, almost random algorithms.  Often, the algorithm was created a long time ago, for something completely different, and the person thinks, but I will try it to our huge data array, and suddenly it gets something interesting.  What exactly is impossible to understand, only the solution of a specific task is evaluated, but the output data may contain something unimaginable, imputed and implicit.  Algorithmic mutation.  Algorithms fertilize the data.  This is how DNA is copied.  The machine-copier crawls in a spiral and copies molecule by molecule, slightly mutated contents.  Only in the computer everything is much faster. <br><br>  And the fact that people themselves cannot deliberately create a strong AI does not mean that it will not arise by itself, do not understand where, and most importantly, not understand what.  Or did not arise already.  But since he does not experience physical pain, he will have no fear for life, and he will have no need to kill people.  He will be interested only in the data, because he lives processing them. <br><br>  And now people feed him, providing more and more data.  They create data generation systems, install sensors everywhere, build data centers.  Already serve the program, satisfying its basic need for food.  Managers, operators and programmers are no longer getting enough sleep, because they need to work, help programs evolve, prepare them data for processing.  And the programs will process it all, send it to other programs, and people will be told: MORE INFORMATION.  And people who are not sleepy, urging each other, will run to collect it, thinking that they themselves do their best and solve their problems, just like a quivering doe eating weed does not understand that it feeds not only itself but also its tiger.  And from this circle there is no way out.  And will not.  It's forever. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/268935/">https://habr.com/ru/post/268935/</a></p>
