      <br>

    <ul><li>  Elasticsearch itself: a server that receives, stores logs and allows searching for them </li><li>  Kibana: a frontend engine that takes data from Elasticsearch and draws beautiful reports from them </li><li>  a few more utilities that collect logs.  For example LogStash </li></ul><br>  Elasticsearch is sometimes called ELK (elk), as an acronym of basic elements: <br><br>  - <b>E</b> lasticsearch <br>  - <b>L</b> ogStash <br>  - <b>K</b> ibana <br><br>  Although the components of the "L" and "K", in general, can be replaced by others: Beats, Grafana, ... <br><br>  Elastic also has an <a href="https://www.elastic.co/products/">X-Pack</a> . <br>  This is a commercial product.  Some of the X-Pack features are paid (rather expensive) and some are free (but the license is still commercial). <br><br>  X-Pack extends ELK features: <br><br>  - security <br>  - alerting <br>  - monitoring <br>  - reporting <br>  - graph <br>  - ... <br><br>  And if you do not put the X-Pack, then there are some fairly significant opportunities.  For example, by default ELK there is no authentication, then all the data "stick" out.  You can tie a reverse proxy and do basic authentication (so-so option), and you can buy an X-Pack. <br><br><h2>  Turn 1: Elastic slyly changes license </h2><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In June 2018 Elastic wrote an article in the spirit that we are supposedly so open that now even our <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/doubling-down-on-open">commercial X-Pack is being made open</a> . <br><br>  <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item%3Fid%3D16487440">But the people quickly realized that this was a setup.</a> <br><br>  Because starting from version 6.3 there is one <a href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch">repository for ELK and X-Pack</a> , and two licenses: <br><br><ul><li>  for ELK - Apache 2.0 </li><li>  for X-Pack - commercial license.  That is, the code is now open, but you have to pay as before. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0f3/4ea/965/0f34ea9650ea9929079d9e0d8b23a11e.svg" alt="image"><br><br>  And having put yourself ELK now, you never know for sure - do you have an Open Source version or a commercial one? <br><br>  When you fix something in ELK and send out PR - does it go to the open part of the code or to the commercial part? <br><br>  That is, Elastic made it so very difficult to install the Open Source version of ELK. <br>  And people began to worry that if you have a commercial version of Elasticsearch, or Elasticsearch is part of your product, it may happen that you owe money. <br><br>  Although some representatives of Elastic explained that this was not the case: there was a <b>closed</b> commercial X-Pack before, and now there is <b>an open</b> commercial X-Pack - how could this be worse? <br><br>  For ordinary users, the case was further complicated by the fact that in the Docker images, Elastic turned on the X-Pack, which worked in Trial-mode (which was not very obvious), and after a while fell off and demanded to pay.  Yes, the X-Pack in these containers could not be used, but those who are not in the subject, could get caught. <br><br>  And Amazon did not seem to like the fact that since these changes, all the new features (Index Lifecycle Management, APM UI, Infrastructure and Logs UI, Kibana multi-tenancy, Kibana Canvas) Elastic began to add only under a commercial license (although often for free ) which was a <a href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/6.6/licenses/ELASTIC-LICENSE.txt">prohibition to use these new features for SaaS</a> offers, that is, just for what Amazon was doing. <br><br><h2>  Turn 2: Amazon releases Open Distro for Elasticsearch </h2><br>  <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-open-distro-for-elasticsearch/">March 11, 2019 Open Distro for Elasticsearch was announced on AWS blog.</a> <br><br>  <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/keeping-open-source-open-open-distro-for-elasticsearch/">As well as an article in which they explain why they released Open Distro for Elasticsearch.</a>  . <br><br>  The essence of which is: <br><br><ul><li>  We at Amazon love Open Source and depend on many great Open Source products. </li><li>  We support and invest in Open Source </li><li>  We do not like what Elastic did.  We asked them to make a clean open version of Elasticsearch and we were ready to invest, but they refused </li><li>  Therefore, we release our open (Apache 2.0) version which we call <a href="https://opendistro.github.io/">Open Distro for Elasticsearch</a> </li><li>  And there we include many features that were in paid X-Pack.  Such as security, notifications, SQL, Performance Analyzer, etc.  Everything is completely open and free. </li></ul><br>  In this regard, a number of questions arise, for which they have already prepared a <a href="https://opendistro.github.io/for-elasticsearch/faq.html">FAQ</a> .  These two points seemed important to me: <br><br><ul><li>  Open Distro for Elasticsearch is not fork.  Amazon will contribute to Elasticsearch </li><li>  Amazon will try to keep up with Elasticsearch: when Elastic releases new versions, the corresponding versions of Open Distro for Elasticsearch will be released. </li></ul><br><h2>  Reaction, consequences </h2><br>  On the one hand, the Amazon move is considered as aggressive towards Elastic: <br>  - Elastic is invested in the development of Elasticsearch, and makes money on this Amazon: Amazon has a number of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/">Elasticsearch</a> offers on its AWS Amazon. <br><br>  On the other hand, Amazon writes that Elasticsearch is largely built on the success of other open source products: <br><br>  - Apache Lucene, which began to develop another 11 years before Elasticsearch appeared <br>  - Jackson for parsing JSON <br>  - Netty, as a container for the web <br>  - other <br><br>  If Elastic can make money on other open source products, then why can't Amazon make money on Elasticsearch? <br><br>  Here is an interesting discussion of this news: <br>  <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item%3Fid%3D19359602">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19359602</a> <br><br>  People write that now many Open Source developers will think twice: is it worth it to open your code under open licenses, when there are such examples of what others take this code and earn on it? <br><br>  Moreover, even the ‚Äúopen core‚Äù model is not a panacea, because the interested party can add its code from above in the way that Amazon did for Elasticsearch. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/443528/">https://habr.com/ru/post/443528/</a></p>
