The updated and radically improved flagship received a lot of positive feedback before it went on sale.  A couple of months ago, we had already studied the Xperia Z2 demo sample in some detail and published a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/sonyxperia/blog/215327">preview</a> , which many of you managed to read, but now it's time for a full review.  Forward! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ad0/db9/2de/ad0db92debe52a2893694fc4643904af.jpg"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      <b>Appearance</b> <br><br>  Designers of Sony Mobile for the second year remain true to the concept of OmniBalance, however, according to creative director Kurozumi Yoshiro, who said in an interview even in winter that he would not like to adhere to a single design when developing all devices, something new can be expected in the near future. <br><br>  Compared to the Z1, the new model has slightly increased the screen, and the frames around it, which many did not like, have become noticeably smaller.  Slightly changed the appearance of the plugs, as well as their location and design.  Now the SIM card slot and usb-connector are located on the left, and the micro-SD card is installed on the right side.  Strange, at first glance, the decision, because SIM change is not as often as a flash drive and it would be more reasonable to place it separately.  However, if you think about it, this distribution of the load on the plugs allows them not to wear out longer.  The audio jack has its own protection and does not need a plug. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/95d/a8f/f22/95da8ff2223fdaf2dcc99f514de9c38e.jpg"><br><br>  The caps themselves, on the sensations, have become more dense, they are very gently inserted and hold well.  The round unlock button moved a couple of millimeters up, and the holes for hanging the jewelry moved to the left.  Well and, of course, it is worth noting that Z2 has become a little easier. <br><br>  <b>Display</b> <br><br>  The screen with a long-awaited 5.2-inch IPS-matrix, 1920x1080 resolution and 423 ppi image density is made using the new Live Color LED technology, which consists of using blue LEDs coated with mixed phosphors of red and green phosphorus (instead of the traditional yellow), in addition, Additional color filters are used, which also improve color rendering and allow for more even distribution of light.  This increases the depth of color, brightness and contrast, and the color rendition becomes much more natural - bright, but without an ‚Äúacidic‚Äù glut, like some modern displays.  The coverage of the RGB palette is 130%. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8fe/2ab/913/8fe2ab913b248aa1c3684cb39bcd5b17.jpg"><br><br>  All claims to viewing angles, which are imposed on the Xperia Z and Z1, can be safely forgotten, because here the angle of inclination has almost no effect on the image, except when turning more than 45 degrees, it becomes slightly darker, but remains clearly visible.  The anti-glare filter plays a role here as well, which significantly reduces the brightness of reflections.  The screen showed itself very well in sunlight, besides, thanks to a powerful battery, you can finally not worry about adjusting the brightness and safely set it to the maximum.  Hooray! <br><br>  The protective film disappeared from the screen (and the back panel), and the glass itself received an oleophobic coating that prevents the formation of oily stains and ensures easy cleaning.  Hooray again!  Those who like the film can stick it on their own, but, in principle, tempered glass is sufficiently resistant to minor scratches, so that Z2 can be easily carried in a pocket without a case. <br><br>  The screen recognizes up to ten simultaneous keystrokes, has a gloved mode and responds correctly to wet hands. <br><br>  <b>Camera</b> <br><br>  The 20.7-megapixel Exmor RS module, the same as in the Xperia Z1, was not subjected to any changes, but the software responsible for the operation of the camera was seriously modified.  Due to this, the problems with focusing and overestimating the ISO in automatic mode, which were encountered in previous versions, completely disappeared.  The image quality has increased significantly and it is noticeable to the naked eye - the pictures have become sharper, the colors are more saturated, shooting in low light conditions has become significantly better, in addition, the compression ratio of photos has been reduced and camera performance has been improved, making it possible to take pictures instantly.  The excess of blue color encountered in the old firmware, as well as the lack of image contrast, has been completely eliminated. <br><br>  As promised, it became possible to shoot slo-mo at 120 frames per second, the effect of blurring the background, video in 4K resolution and the function of augmented reality in video mode.  Below you can find pictures taken in various conditions.  Used mainly automatic mode. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c2b/189/4e0/c2b1894e086916030b9416f12ef6dd84.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9ce/abc/62b/9ceabc62be65977cb8ffff8a3b6114e4.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7a4/613/7bc/7a46137bca21b15995d98076b7a74914.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/400/647/873/400647873197ce933b8ddf39ea624c5c.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f67/34f/be2/f6734fbe2963a7423214856abfeb49ec.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7d4/ac6/47e/7d4ac647e08b334f24380ef440f51aea.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a9a/4fc/350/a9a4fc350ecb7b9eef4381719546d115.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/57d/084/26f/57d08426f7b578c6d11f67f9e2e7cca6.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Multimedia</b> <br><br>  With the sound, in general, and in previous models, everything was very good, but Z2 received a serious update here.  The speakers located in the lower and upper parts of the phone provide high-quality and very loud stereo sound in games and when watching movies.  The traditional xLoud function (built-in Walkman compressor / maximizer) is useful to those who like to listen to music without headphones and loudly, it is possible to simulate the S-Force Front Surround surround sound and the function of reducing the mutual influence of the right and left channels to get a true stereo sound.  For those who do not want to delve into the settings of the player, there is still a ClearAudio Plus function - a comprehensive sound enhancement with one button. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b88/a82/352/b88a82352472962bf2529d3485e2d933.jpg"><br><br>  Despite the moisture-proof membranes with which the speakers are supplied, there is no need to complain about the volume, but in the conversational dynamics it turned out to be excessive and a separate volume control would not hurt here. <br><br>  Another significant innovation is the five-pin audio jack, which allows the use of a headset with active noise cancellation (buyers of the official Russian versions, by the way, get it in the standard package).  Recall about this system - the microphones located on the headset pick up the surrounding noise, and the smartphone in response generates a noise that is in antiphase with the surrounding.  Thus, extraneous background sounds are completely neutralized without isolating the listener from the outside world.  During a call, the left microphone, in turn, can be used for conversation. <br><br>  Using the five-pin connector also allows you to connect a stereo microphone to the Z2, which can be useful when shooting video or field recording.  The microphone, however, comes separately. <br><br>  <b>Autonomy</b> <br><br>  The battery can be called a strong place Xperia Z2 - 3200 mAh is more than the direct competitors.  For all the time of use, I did not manage to plant it to the end, except for how to do it intentionally.  The device was enough to recharge a little or once every two days leave for the night connected to the outlet.  Two days of very intensive use (Internet, photo, video, music, games and navigation) without STAMINA mode - this is a really good result.  The use of energy-saving functions, respectively, allows you to increase the battery life by 2-3 times. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c3e/470/acc/c3e470acccfd438a60df46a525f0c79b.jpg"><br><br>  For all this, however, you have to pay a fairly tangible charging time and requirements for energy sources.  When using a ‚Äúnative‚Äù charger, the whole process takes about three hours (there is a charge from zero to one hundred percent), in addition, the device can completely refuse to charge from extraneous charging and weak USB ports. <br><br>  <b>Iron and performance</b> <br><br>  Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 based on the four cores of the Krait 400 with the support of the Anreno 330 video accelerator and as many as three gigabytes of RAM can cope with absolutely any task.  Back in February, the Xperia Z2 was recognized by the AnTuTu Team as the most productive smartphone presented at the MWC 2014 conference. Of course, during this time it had a number of competitors, but this does not negate the fact that the Z2 has enough capacity for even the most demanding applications and games . <br><br>  16 GB of internal memory (of which 11 is available to the user) and support for micro-SD cards up to 128 GB solve all issues with content storage, and in OTG mode, you can connect not only USB flash drives but also keyboards with mice to the device (a special adapter). <br><br>  Below, as usual, presents the results of the main tests. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d30/924/eec/d30924eec0eb5395f3924767da055e11.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Protection</b> <br><br>  Just like the Xperia Z and Z1, the Z2 model is protected from moisture and dust in accordance with the IP58 standard.  This ensures the operability of the phone after immersion in fresh water to a depth of 1.5 m and when in water for up to 30 minutes.  All plugs, of course, must be tightly closed.  Since the screen does not respond to pressing, being in the water, for underwater photography, you can use the camera launch button.  Neither splashes nor full immersion in the water cause any harm to the device, except that the water that has got into the protective membranes of the speakers can degrade the sound for a while. <br><br>  <b>OS and applications</b> <br><br>  Android 4.4.2 KitKat is installed on the Xperia Z2 with a familiar Sony shell and pre-installed applications and special bonuses.  The standard set, in general, has not changed lately - these are TrackID, Evernote, File Commander, OfficeSuite, Socialife and a number of proprietary services such as Sony Select and PlayStation Network. <br><br>  Until June 31, owners of Xperia Z1, Z1 Compact and Z2 smartphones can receive a number of bonuses as a gift, for this you need to use the Xperia Lounge application, which is already installed on the smartphone.  The list of bonuses is somewhat different for different models (for example, there are no free movies and navigator for the Z1 Compact), but in general it is like this: <br><br>  - Full version of the Garmin Xperia Edition navigation app (Xperia Z2 only) <br>  - Full version of OfficeSuite Pro office application <br>  - 50 GB in Box.net cloud service.  Forever and ever. <br>  - 1 TB in the Bitcasa cloud service.  For three months. <br>  - 3 months of premium subscription to Evernote. <br>  - 10 additional themes. <br>  - 1 month of premium subscription to the Social Live service. <br>  - 6 free movies <br>  - Michael Jackson's XSCAPE album <br>  - 30-day subscription to the Music Unlimited service. <br>  - 8 games from PlayStation Mobile <br><br>  <b>Total</b> <br><br>  If the Xperia Z1 and there were some flaws, in the case of the Z2 was carried out a grand "work on the bugs" and there is simply nothing to complain about.  First of all, of course, we are pleased with the updated screen and the camera application.  Some may consider a certain drawback to be rather large in size, but unfortunately there is no official information about the possible release of the Z2 Compact. <br><br>  <b>Specifications</b> <br><br>  <b>Screen</b> : 5.2-inch, 1920x1080 <br>  <b>Processor</b> : Snapdragon quad-core 2.3 GHz <br>  <b>Memory</b> : 3 GB RAM, 16 GB internal, SD card slot <br>  <b>Camera</b> : Exmor RS 1 / 2.3 ", 20.7 megapixel <br>  <b>OS</b> : Android 4.4.2 KitKat <br>  <b>Battery</b> : 3200 mAh <br>  <b>Protection</b> : IP58 <br>  <b>The official price at the start</b> : 29990 p. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/223677/">https://habr.com/ru/post/223677/</a></p>
