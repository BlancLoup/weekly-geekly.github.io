  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Questions on the promotion of applications for Android</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently, a friend of mine asked me to answer a few questions about promoting Android apps.  We agreed that I would write a post.  Over the past year I have had a definite impression about working in the Android Market.  I am pleased to share my opinion.  I hope that my experience will be useful to developers.  I would be glad if the post gives rise to a constructive discussion. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  By Android Market: </h5><br>  <b>1. How often do they post updates, are there any real bug fixes in these updates or do users ‚Äúbelieve and silently update‚Äù?</b> <br><br>  As a user, I either ‚Äúbelieve and silently update‚Äù the application, or do not update it at all if I'm not interested in the application.  All people are different and there are users who always follow the current changes in the update, my IMHO - dominated by people who install updates, delving into the details rarely.  There is also a category of applications in which each update brings new features.  As a rule, loyal users of such an application always expect a new functionality or content to be updated. <br><br>  As a developer, I think that the application needs to be updated regularly once every one or two weeks.  There are at least two reasons for this: firstly, regular updates with new features and content have a positive effect on the formation of a loyal audience of the project; secondly, when updating, the application falls into the 'Just in' category, which positively affects the number of downloads.  If the application has positive comments and high ratings, the volume of downloads when updating is much more.  It is worth noting that if you update more often than once a week, there will be no download jump, as the application will not be included in 'Just in'. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      Empty updates without changes should be avoided.  Almost always (all of us are not without sin!) In an update, I strive to make some new feature or fix bugs.  Without bugs there is only hello word, so there is always something to improve / correct, especially when it comes to programs for mobile devices.  Most likely, frequent empty updates can negatively affect the loyalty of the audience and the reputation of the developer.  In addition, a saturated update, as a rule, is very effective.  IMHO is the ideal option - to pre-upgrade updates before the release of the application, even if the first version will be slightly curtailed. <br><br>  As practice shows, regular updates are a very important and effective tool in promoting applications, but to achieve decent results, updates are not enough. <br><br>  <b>2. What is the dynamics of downloads needed and for what period to get into the TOP?</b> <br><br>  It is difficult to answer this question unequivocally, since the market is changing rapidly.  Today TOP Free is much more difficult to enter than TOP Paid.  My experience shows that if there are 5-10 downloads within one to two months, then you can enter TOP Paid-100 in its category.  With TOP Free is a bit more complicated.  At various times I reached 30 places in TOP Free in my category.  My most successful application has 700,000 downloads since April last year, with the first 50,000 downloads being difficult, then it went easier.  Now this program is kept in the TOP Free 50 in its category with the dynamics of 1000-5000 downloads per day.  At the weekend downloads more by 20-30%. <br><br>  <b>3. If the application is free, but it has internal payments, do they have to be made through Google Checkout or do they close their eyes to this?</b> <br><br>  Domestic payments are a very profitable model, however, I did not try it on Android.  Considering the overwhelming majority of free applications, I was afraid that this model would be perceived by the users.  I heard that <b>PayPal</b> has its own in-app purchase library for Android, but there is no experience with it.  For domestic payments, there are several interesting branches on StackOverflow. <br><br>  <b>4. What statistics are collected for - downloads, the number of users by version, what they do in an application, etc.</b> <br><br>  As I try to make applications as 'easy' as possible, I don‚Äôt use a special library to collect statistics.  Statistics in my applications is collected by the Mobclix advertising library.  In the admin area I have the opportunity to watch 'App Opens' and 'New Users' by the hour, except for directly advertising indicators (impressions, eCPM, eCPC, etc.).  I agree that collecting statistics is very important, but for now I am content with a limited set of parameters. <br><br><h5>  By promotion: </h5><br>  <b>5. Have you worked with review sites and directories?</b>  <b>Is there a clear leader who gives the most downloads?</b>  <b>In the event that the review and the catalog gives a link to the application in the Android Market, is it possible to track which resource gave these downloads on the Market?</b> <br><br>  With review sites worked.  I do not think that there is a clear leader, like <b>TouchArcade</b> for iOS.  I think that a good effect will be a review on the <b>Pocket Gamer</b> .  Ideal - google to find as many review sites as possible, sort them out by Alex and send them a request to make a review.  The more reviews the better!  To track the number of downloads from a specific review is not possible for me at the moment.  You can also order banners on thematic sites.  There is a resource <b>BuySellAds.com</b> , where you can filter and sort advertising spaces on android sites by impressions and price.  In addition, you can directly contact advertisers on popular sites.  Surely, popular sites belong to media holdings, with which you can, if you wish, master a part of the advertising budget. <br><br>  As for third-party, alternative directories for Android software, I could not achieve the number of downloads comparable to the Android Market.  The main reason for my failure is my laziness.  Since there are a lot of directories and I do updates almost every week, I am very uncomfortable submitting updates regularly.  So I scored on the catalogs for now.  Perhaps I just do not see a decent alternative to the Android Market.  I admit that I will return to the topic of directories later. <br><br>  <b>6. Did you work with any of the ad networks like Tapjoy.com, Mdotm.com, Smaato.com?</b>  <b>I mean, as an advertiser.</b>  <b>According to the show?</b>  <b>By downloads?</b> <br><br>  As an advertiser, I mainly worked with <b>AdMob</b> and <b>Mobclix</b> .  Contextual advertising budgets were not very large, so it is difficult to objectively compare.  According to my feelings, for a free application for 10 clicks there is one instal.  Again, much depends on the content of the advertisement, the application description and screenshots. <br><br>  <b>7. Did you place ads in contextual advertising by Google?</b> <br><br>  Often I advertise applications using <b>AdMob</b> , $ 200 dollars are spent for 6-7 hours.  According to my statistics, 237 hits account for one click (not the best indicator), for $ 200 you can get about 5000-10000 clicks and, according to my feelings, 500-1000 downloads.  Perhaps I am mistaken in the calculations. <br><br>  <b>8. A similar question on the same grids - with whom it is better to work on displaying someone else's advertisements, why.</b> <br><br>  As an ad salesman, I worked closely with <b>AdMob</b> , <b>Quattro Wirelless</b> and <b>Mobclix</b> .  Now I use mainly <b>Mobclix</b> .  Today, for my most popular program, an average of 600-700 thousand impressions are generated per day.  It should be noted that if the program is popular, then the advertising network is not always enough advertising in order to serve all the requests of the application.  If this happens, you can lose up to 90% of their income.  For such cases, there are solutions that allow you to maximize the filling of advertising applications by automatically replacing ad networks based on the presence of ads.  Today I know 2 solutions that allow you to do this automatically - <b>AdMob + AdWirl</b> and <b>Mobclix</b> .  I like <b>Mobclix more</b> , because <b>Mobclix</b> collects money from all ad networks, accumulates them and makes one payment to the developer from all networks.  In the case of <b>AdWirl,</b> with each ad network you need to receive money separately.  The advantages of <b>Mobclix</b> also include the ability to use <b>AdMob</b> as an alternative. <br><br>  <b>Outro</b> <br><br>  By the end of 2010, I was convinced that developing for Android is not only interesting, but also beneficial.  On the advertising model, you can earn quite well.  In the Android Market now there are many free niches that can and should be taken. <br><br>  I am sure that there are many ways to promote your software for Android.  The main thing - do not be afraid to experiment!  Do not be upset if something does not work out and never stop. <br><br>  Thank.  I would be very happy for your comments. <br><br>  UPD.  In the comments to collect statistics, applications are advised to use Flurry or Google Analytics for Android. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/112185/">https://habr.com/ru/post/112185/</a></p>
