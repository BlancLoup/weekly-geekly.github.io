True, many companies and entrepreneurs believe that it is enough to entrust this task to professionals - and the result will not take long.  Our experience shows that without changing business processes within the company, no advertising budgets will help sales in the long run.

There is no understanding of the ultimate goal.</b> <br><br>  As a rule, communication with a potential client begins with the question: ‚ÄúWhat is the ultimate goal you want to achieve?‚Äù And we often hear the answer: ‚ÄúThe site is in the top search results‚Äù.  Naturally, such a desire lies on the surface, but by itself cannot be the goal, so we understand what the client really wants from moving, and ultimately we come to the fact that he needs an increase in sales of his goods or services.  Very often, an incorrect goal setting is related to the fact that people who do not understand anything in this area, such as a system administrator or a PR manager, are engaged in Internet marketing in a company.  The owner sets them the task of increasing site traffic, and they literally try to implement it.  Sometimes, without meeting with the owner, it is impossible to know about the final goal. <br><br>  <b>2. Advertising is not enough</b> <br><br>  Many clients believe that in order to increase the number of orders, it is enough just to launch an advertising campaign by signing an agreement with a professional agency.  This is not true.  To achieve sales growth, it is necessary to work in a complex and, above all, be prepared for an increase in the number of orders.  Once the developer turned to us, the purpose of which was to increase the number of apartments sold.  Having studied the customer's business, we determined that in addition to attracting users to the site, it is necessary to expand the staff of sales managers or connect an external call-center as the first line of communication with potential customers.  If this is not done, then as a result of the advertising campaign there will be a large number of missed calls, which means that we will waste time and energy, and the client will be money.  In addition, it will negatively affect the customer's reputation, because an unprocessed order is worse than an unattended order.  Unfortunately, these arguments did not convince the client, he refused to expand the staff, and we refused to work with him so as not to spoil our karma. <br><br>  There are also more complex cases, especially in online trading, when a customer believes that the increase in traffic to the site will lead to an increase in sales.  Our practice was to work with an online gift store with low sales and small revenue.  We analyzed the site and found many errors, ranging from non-existent pages and ending with an inconvenient catalog.  Our specialists warned that in order to increase the number of orders, the client needs to increase the product matrix, work on the site usability (usability), expand the points of issue of orders, connect the courier service and hire additional employees.  However, the customer preferred to spend all the money on contextual advertising.  According to the results of the advertising campaign, he received as much profit as he invested in advertising and, naturally, was not satisfied. <br><br>  <b>3. Waiting for quick results</b> <br><br>  You do not expect to get a relief press after one day in the gym, so you should not expect quick results from SEO-optimization, because this is a painstaking step-by-step work.  True, not all entrepreneurs understand this.  We had a client - a cosmetics company, which ordered the promotion of its website.  We discussed in advance that we would give recommendations that need to be implemented on the site, after which within two to three months a slight increase will begin, and after four months a good result will appear.  The client agreed, made the payment, and a week later the daily calls to our manager began with the question: ‚ÄúWhy is the site not yet in the top?‚Äù Each time the employee was forced to explain that this was not happening instantly.  Calls continued, the manager did not spend time on project management, but on explaining the features of search promotion to the client.  As a result, we were forced to break off relations in order to save time and nerves of all participants in the process. <br><br>  <b>4. The desire to conquer the world of the province</b> <br><br>  Many customers want to expand their markets with the help of the Internet.  For example, the owner of a company engaged in the construction of houses in Kirov, turned to us to promote his website in the Moscow region.  We offered to open a representative office in the capital, specify the contacts of the Moscow office (there were only Kirov phone numbers on the site), because without this it is difficult to communicate with the client and sell the houses while being a thousand kilometers away from the market.  The customer explained that there was no such possibility, so we refused to work, since the effectiveness of the promotion would be zero.  Even if we were able to raise the site in the issue, increase traffic, the number of orders is unlikely to increase according to costs.  Competition in the construction market in the Moscow region is high, and it is easier for the end customer to place an order by finding out information via a metropolitan phone number or driving to the office. <br><br>  Source: <a href="http://www.rbc.ru/opinions/own_business/16/03/2016/56e2cdaf9a79472d8be3baea">RBC</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299534/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299534/</a></p>
