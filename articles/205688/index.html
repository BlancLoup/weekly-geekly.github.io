Our profession is remarkable in that it penetrates into all spheres of a person‚Äôs life and work: it forces everyone to understand completely different areas.  Just as mathematics is a basic tool for many sciences, the ‚Äúmind gymnastics‚Äù is a way to record, study, formalize the processes of physics, biology, astronomy ‚Äî programming has become a similar tool among types of economic (and not only) activities.  Despite the popular stereotype, It It-shniki have a broad outlook, fast and logical thinking, and of course - a sparkling sense of humor.  There are hardly many believers among us.  But in spite of all this, superstitions, delusions, and other irrational urges are not alien to many. <br>  And then faith, you ask?  Now I will explain .... <a name="habracut"></a>

      One of the moss of delusions is the absurd belief that with the help of words one can explain to any person, convey to him the meaning, convince, make him understand.  Over and over again, when the interlocutor is mistaken in things that are obvious to me, I am inexorably drawn to correct the situation.  And often the result is only bewilderment and disappointment: it seems that everything is so clearly explained, cited examples, laid out on the shelves ... but no.  And it is clear that if they do not want to listen to you, they will not be heard.  But faith remains. <br><br>  Another thing - public opinion, prevailing judgment, generally accepted understanding.  I have heard more than once that it is truly embarrassing to write off the control in the USA.  We have such a crook - a resourceful hero, a quick-witted lad - and generally well done (in the eyes of classmates, of course).  And I do not think that it is necessary to drag in the "historical aspects of the development of the Russian man" - everything is simple.  There, shame, with us - not ashamed.  The mechanism works that way.  Therefore, they do it, and vigilant teachers won't save you at all. <br><br>  I believe that this is the case on the roads of Russia.  Only children are bigger, toys are more expensive, and the negative consequences of breaking the rules and rudeness are more serious and dangerous.  I have friends whom I have not been able to explain for a long time that it is <b>impossible</b> to do <b>this</b> .  ‚ÄúEverybody does, and I do‚Äù is the most popular answer.  But I am sure: if the position of society on this issue will be clearly expressed and conveyed to everyone, then a significant part of the drivers will cease to be riders.  Similar reasoning led us to the creation of the <a href="http://www.ezduki.ru/">Eziuki</a> project. <br><br><h4>  What is already now </h4><br><br>  Everything is extremely simple.  Authorization, uploading a photo or video, comments, ‚Äúdo not like‚Äù button (there are no and there will not be a ‚Äúlike‚Äù button!), Map, search by state.  number.  Yes, state  the number is required - the ezdik should not be completely anonymous.  The law on personal data is not violated here - the state number is not such data.  Moreover, according to the law, state.  the number must always be visible on the vehicle - what personal data is there.  This is a precautionary response to the comments of those who doubted the legality of the entry of such habrovchan data. <br><br>  Technical innovations, too, can not boast.  It was interesting to deal with Youtube - the downloadable video gets on the resource channel without authorizing the user on youtube, as if ‚Äúopaque‚Äù for him.  But this was something new for us, as well as a well-known opportunity, no nanotechnology. <br><br>  Another aspect that we stress is the submission of applications to the traffic police via the Internet.  Such an opportunity is on the resource of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and we kindly send there users who wish to submit an application.  We have a beautiful panel with an illustration of the sequence of actions for those who are not indifferent: take off the rider on the DVR, upload it to the site, apply to the traffic police.  And of course, I myself tried to file such applications: not very successfully, but work is being done on them.  Recognized specifically.  Who knows, if there will be a lot of them - suddenly the approach of the law enforcement agencies will change, and this will become effective?  Let's try.  As they say, all good people must come together and kill all bad ones.  Killing is not our method, but it would be nice to prosecute. <br><br><h4>  Yes, there are already such projects! </h4><br><br>  Yes there is.  Not very promoted, really.  There is one generally excellent in execution, can I not give a link?  So why do the same, you ask.  Frankly, this question worried us.  At first it was just interesting to do, and see what happens.  And when what happened - like it, you already begin to want the creation of your bright future.  There was a question: how are we different?  How will we be better?  The obvious idea behind the surface is mobile apps.  The most notable competitors do not have full coverage (Android, iOS, WinPhone) smartphones.  We will do.  But this now will surprise no one. <br><br>  All the fun usually occurs at the junction of areas.  We already have several associates with an active citizenship, met with relevant lawyers.  Ideally, if everything goes to the project, such people should be in every city.  What is their task: first, to assist users.  Competent expert advice is always helpful and interesting.  Secondly, from time to time we plan to apply independently where we should, to seek a ruling and share information on the resource - such are the ‚Äúsuccess stories‚Äù.  Show people that it works. <br>  True, lawyers have to pay ... more on that later. <br><br><h4>  And where is the business? </h4><br><br>  There is no business here, as they say.  It is clear that any popular resource can be monetized in any way.  But no investor will consider investment in our project cost-effective - I don‚Äôt even want to try.  Exceptionally out of curiosity, stuck a link to the "Messenger" on the icon of the DVR - it was visible on the map of clicks that people constantly press there, but nothing happens.  ‚ÄúProbably, people expect to see suggestions on DVRs,‚Äù we thought.  I registered on the admitad resource, connected the Svyaznoy affiliate program.  It became interesting how it works: I went through the link from Ezdyukov to the online store, ordered a product that I did not really need, paid for right away.  Waiting for the effect - the effect is not observed.  Currently I have an interesting correspondence with technical support.  Let's see how it ends. <br><br>  And the guys from Boomstarter came to us and they were very interested in the idea.  And we launched a campaign to raise funds for the project.  If it is successful, then, depending on the amount collected, you can do very different things - up to fantastic ideas, such as issuing a special DVR with the ability to immediately send videos where necessary.  Well it is, from the very unreal.  But it is quite possible to provide competent analysis of issues and regular actions to bring violators to justice by the collective. <br><br>  I would very much like crowdfunding in Russia to work.  This is an excellent example of how the use of information technology is rather uncomplicated, in our times, can greatly influence the progress in any field: from entertainment to serious scientific projects.  Surely, many of the readers repeatedly came up with really interesting ideas - the realization of which required funds.  Crowdcrafting, if it becomes popular, is a marvelous tool for bringing ideas to life.  Now in Russia there are very few successful projects in this area, we will look at the fate of <a href="https://boomstarter.ru/projects/85846/15117">our</a> <br><br>  But it is possible to say for sure: at this moment, the Ezyuki project is not commercial, but social.  We want him to become popular, and slightly changed the situation for the better.  And let it be hopeless optimism: there must be faith among IT specialists.  Faith in your projects. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/205688/">https://habr.com/ru/post/205688/</a></p>
