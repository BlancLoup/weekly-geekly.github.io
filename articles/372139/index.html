    <a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  What is Maker Faire? </h2><br><br>  Maker Faire is a festival of science and modern technologies for inventors, engineers and technologists of all ages.  This is a science fair, an exhibition of modern technologies, an interactive art gallery, but above all is a place for communication between makers and DIY artists.  In 2015, the event was held at 135 sites and gathered more than a million makers around the world. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2f1/688/f99/2f1688f997a34304bb2f620861c4fbf9.jpg" alt="Maker Faire in Rome"><br><br>  The exhibitors have the opportunity to take their devices out of the back rooms and garage workshops to a wide stage, receive recognition and community support, discuss projects with like-minded people and even find sponsors. <br><br>  How this happens you can ask the author of the project of the underwater robot OpenROV David Leng: at Maker Faire, he gathered a team of enthusiasts from 30 countries and with their help set up mass production of <a href="http://www.openrov.com/">amateur remote-controlled bathyscaphes</a> costing only $ 900, which is ten times cheaper than professional devices. <br><br>  For visitors, this is a huge technopark, in which there is something interesting for all family members: scientific exhibitions, works of modern art, and master classes.  The record of attendance of the festival events was set in 2014 in New York, when over three days the exhibition was visited by more than 215,000 people, with half of the visitors bringing with them children. <br><br>  Huge robots, nimble Copters, kinetic sculptures, competitions of bots and costume shows will not leave anyone indifferent from 5 to 105 years. <br><br>  With a performance on Maiker Faire, the band ArcAttack! Began its journey to fame, whose musicians reached the semifinals of the show ‚ÄúAmerica is looking for talents‚Äù with a cover of the song ‚ÄúIron Man‚Äù <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DclVHBVfUKW8">performed on Tesla's huge coils</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e9a/752/b20/e9a752b2012c412b90501d7ed5f8420a.jpg" alt="Adam Savage during the AirAttak performance!"><br><br><h2>  What to do at the festival? </h2><br>  Scientific shows are held for the youngest to better understand the world around them.  The fundamentals of physics, chemistry, computer science are not explained by dry lines of textbooks, but glow, explode, smoke and smell: here you can see how the laser beam is scattered by smoke, play snowballs in the summer, draw coronary discharges and play with dinosaur robots. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d47/691/db0/d47691db0d7a4aea851ab48172345edb.jpg" alt="Maker Faire Exhibit Space"><br><br>  Older guys will do the first project with their own hands - assemble a robot, construct and print a model on a 3D printer, engrave initials with a laser machine, or try themselves in pottery.  And among schoolchildren competitions of scientific projects, competitions of mobile bots and even races on homemade bikes are held. <br><br>  For experienced makers, master classes and workshops are held - from software development to wood processing, from creating quadrocopters to knitting.  Particular emphasis is placed on the description of first-hand technology available in home projects. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/58d/867/130/58d867130b6f48c69ce863d1ddebbff7.jpg" alt="Massimo Bianci speaks at Maker Faire"><br><br>  For example, last year Massimo Bianci himself, the founder of the Arduino project, spoke about creating devices with microcontrollers. <br><br>  You can also hear about non-standard applications of familiar things from the team ‚ÄúMythBusters‚Äù led by Adam Savage or get acquainted with Diana Eng, whose collection of clothes with electronic components in 2010 opened the way for transistors and LEDs to the world of high fashion. <br><br>  The list of guests of the Moscow stage Maker Faire is still being clarified, follow the publications on the website of the Russian stage <a href="http://makerfairemoscow.com/">makerfairemoscow.com</a> . <br><br><h2>  How to get on Maker Faire? </h2><br>  The first Maker Faire, which took place in 2006 in California, gathered more than 20,000 visitors in two days.  But the organizers of the event - O'Relly, known for ‚Äúbooks with animals‚Äù and the author of web 2.0 concept Dale Dorety - decided not to stop there, and a year later Texas joined the festival in California, and the total number of visitors tripled. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a26/b67/f54/a26b67f54d824f03941cb1d557c3c02b.jpg" alt="Outdoor Playground Maker Faire"><br><br>  Ten years later, in 2015, 135 events around the world have passed under the flag of Maker Faire, gathering more than a million people. <br><br>  Now Russian enthusiasts have a chance to become part of the international community of makers: on July 9 and 10, the first Russian stage of Maker Faire will take place at the site of the National Research Technological University MISiS. <br><br>  We, the company Amperka, in order to popularize the DIY movement in Russia, set up the ‚ÄúGolden Tape‚Äù award.  Anyone who can bring their electronic project to the Moscow stage of the Maker Faire festival can fight for it.  We will talk about the most interesting and unusual projects, and the winner of the award - send to the European stage Maker Faire in Berlin. <br><br>  To participate in the contest, <a href="https://makerfairemoscow.com/maker/">register on the site makerfairemoscow.com</a> , bring the projects on July 9 and 10 to Leninsky prospect, 4. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/kRJMsXYOyvM%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjtB7k61IlTH5gvXQBYyMrdYXxR7A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Follow the project news <a href="https://www.youtube.com/amperkaru/">on our YouTube channel</a> .
