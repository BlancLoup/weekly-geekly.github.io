  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Editing reality. Moscow City Court removed from the history of the record on appealing the case Pleer.com</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The project Pleer.com is for sale.  The corresponding appeal was published on the <a href="http://pleer.com/ru">main page</a> (in Russian). <br><br>  Pleer.com is forever blocked on the territory of the Russian Federation by the decision of the Moscow City Court in <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/265188/">November 2015</a> .  Unfortunately, the Russian authorities could not carry out this procedure in such a way that would not cause any complaints.  The owners of Pleer.com believe that the blockage was carried out contrary to law, in violation of the procedure.  They have all the reasons for such an assessment. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  First, the owners have learned about blocking their site from the media.  For some reason, Roskomnadzor sent a notification to the Cloudflare DNS-registrar, and not to the hosting provider Leaseweb, which punishes them very strictly for the slightest complaints and would certainly have dealt with this problem.  But in Cloudflare, apparently, they did not understand anything and did not pay attention to the complaint. <br><br>  It was even more interesting.  ‚ÄúWe were very surprised at the unexpected blocking and decided to fight.  In a very short time, we filed an appeal to the Moscow City Court and decided to go all the way to the end, at least from the point of view of scientific value, ‚Äùsay the representatives of the site administration.

      But on March 9, Roskomnadzor decided that the court order on perpetual blocking had <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/272350/">entered into force</a> . <br><br>  The owners of Pleer.com did not receive notifications and no response to the filed complaint.  Moreover, the Moscow City Court <b>has removed from the site</b> information about the complaint. <br><br>  Here is how the <a href="http://www.mos-gorsud.ru/inf/infp/gi1/%3Fid%3D494c5fbd-875f-443f-a786-7898aa97ce06">information about the consideration of the case</a> looked before. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bd3/845/2aa/bd38452aa19bc9b640b6128693020f94.png"><br><br>  This is how it looks now. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/928/3e9/d2d/9283e9d2da1a4061ac3f1e9fc1873766.png"><br><br>  ‚ÄúWhy it happened and what to do with it, we do not know.  Our legal department has never faced such lawlessness and is now in a deadlock, - the administration of pleer.com writes.  That is, in fact, we were deprived of the opportunity to defend our case in court and blocked.  RiP. <br><br>  UPD 28.03.  The GT editor received a comment from the Moscow City Court‚Äôs Public Relations Department: ‚ÄúThe Moscow City Court received a complaint about the decision referred to by the author regarding the Pleer.com resource.  Information on the receipt of the complaint was entered into an automated database synchronized with the official website of the Moscow City Court;  On the official website of the court was posted information about the appeal decision.  Meanwhile, the complaint was subsequently returned to the applicant, since it did not meet the requirements of the Civil Procedure Code of the Russian Federation.  I will add that the complainants are not deprived of the opportunity to appeal the court‚Äôs decision to return their appeal and to exercise their right to defense.  After the appeal was returned, the information about the appeal was withdrawn from the automated information database and the court‚Äôs official website indicated the effective date of the court decision, calculated according to the rules of the Civil Procedure Code of the Russian Federation ‚Äù. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/392281/">https://habr.com/ru/post/392281/</a></p>
