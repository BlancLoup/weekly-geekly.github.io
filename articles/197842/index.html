      The characteristics of <b>Boost 2 are</b> as follows: <br><br>  - Android 4.1 <br>  - 5 'screen, 1280 x 720, 294 ppi <br>  - 8 megapixel rear camera <br>  - Front Camera 2 MP <br>  - 4-core Snapdragon S4 Play 1.2 GHz <br>  - 1 GB RAM <br>  - 2 GB of internal memory, microSD slot <br>  - GPS, Bluetooth 4.0 <br>  - Battery 3000 mAh + 6000 mAh <br>  - Dimensions: 140 x 68.6 x 9.8 / 15 mm <br>  - Weight: 151/202 g. <br><br>  Retail price in Russia: <b>11 thousand rubles</b> <br><br>  Always, when you test some state employee, you start from the price and opportunities.  Boost 2 is no exception, for a relatively small price you can get a few unique features. <br><br>  <b>Filling</b> <br><br>  Considerable interest was caused by the Snapdragon S4 Play processor.  I first heard about this and began to read.  It became clear that Highscreen engineers began to look for a budget 4-core, which will support 2 SIM-cards and Bluetooth 4.0 standard.  Play responds to these requests and fits perfectly into the cost and positioning of Boost 2, combining new data transfer standards and normal power.  <i>About S4 Play can be read <a href="http://4pda.ru/2012/09/27/72983/">here</a> .</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/eb8/024/2de/eb80242def026aeaef4b1ba3232404c7.png"><br><br>  1 GB of RAM and a NoName accelerator ( <i>I have not found information that the video chip is installed in Boost 2</i> ) paired with a cheap pebble allow the phone to work with almost no delays, and Real Racing 3 is generally without brakes.  Of course, with "degraded" graphics, but without brakes.  I simultaneously tested the Oppo Mirror, which costs 3,000 rubles more - here the RR3 slows down much more. <br><br>  AnTuTu results <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a3f/0b9/e23/a3f0b9e234fcdd9637aae74980cd5861.png"><br><br>  <b>Appearance</b> <br><br>  The second generation of Boost looks unequivocally better than the first: the build is better, the form factor and angles themselves are thought over by engineers and, in general, they look more expensive.  By its appearance, the phone pulls to the level of 15-20 thousand rubles, and these are completely different budgets. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b7d/f9b/b95/b7df9bb95a9516c0cd4a61d5557b6060.png"><br><br>  Included with the Boost 2 is an additional battery, and hence the second removable cover.  It is much thicker than the standard: 15 millimeters versus 9. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d8e/a92/685/d8ea926852c27e05678a7e551fd5171a.png"><br><br>  In a hand with such a thick lid and a weight of 202 grams, the sensations change drastically: hard and not very comfortable.  And, oddly enough, you get used to it quickly, but for those who once went with a battery case to the iPhone or Android device, this generally remains beyond the limits of disadvantages. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4df/d21/a4d/4dfd21a4d52dc60cbe83c4f535e0701e.png"><br><br>  As for the normal battery and the cover, in this video the phone looks very presentable.  Many compare it in appearance with Oppo Find 5 and iOcean X7. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/913/dc1/8b0/913dc18b067c56d76fcbc0b06bf5cc76.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ea5/a70/d30/ea5a70d30914b6c6a2c5076281677a6a.jpg"><br><br>  I can not take on these judgments, since I have never held a Find 5 or a X7 in my hands, and photographs are often deceptive.  One thing for sure, Boost 2 in life looks very, very good. <br><br>  <b>Battery</b> <br><br>  * The most important thing in this phone is the battery.  Highscreen Boost 2, according to manufacturers, holds the battery up to 2 weeks.  Unfortunately, I can not confirm this data, because after a two-week test, I charged the phone several times already. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b66/e27/e10/b66e27e1032e169de953fad08fc685a4.png"><br><br>  The most effective indicator is 7 days of work.  I can not say that I run hard games all day long, like RR3, but I used the phone mainly as a web device.  Often he launched "everyday" programs, like Sberbank Online, Metro, Instagram and so on. <br><br>  That is, with a 6000 mAh battery, the phone pulls out for about a week of average use.  I also conducted the following test: if you watch a video with brightness and sound at 100%, Boost 2 turns off with a charge of 0 after 11 hours.  Quite a good result, but again - I would like more. <br><br>  <i>You should definitely take into account that I tested a prototype, not a commercial release, so the results can vary greatly in the end.</i> <br><br>  <b>System</b> <br><br>  Boost 2 is the lucky winner of the almost bare Android 4.1, there are only a few interesting pieces, like the built-in toggles.  Sadly, there are 2 gigabytes of built-in available memory inside, so all hopes are on the flash card, and there is a connector for it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d69/9e9/473/d699e9473b32fa11838307691891f6df.png"><br><br>  I did not notice that some applications refused to work or slowed down.  Everything is on the level. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/634/68e/d8f/63468ed8fb8dd4dd7864204d589349a0.png"><br><br>  Highscreen Boost 2 is one of those budget smartphones that will be chosen by those people for whom the battery is the most critical indicator.  Even with work a week is an excellent result, and now all the ‚Äúcheapness‚Äù is pulled up a class higher in terms of system design and operation.  It is pleasant to realize and it is pleasant to think that for a relatively low price you get a suitable machine. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/197842/">https://habr.com/ru/post/197842/</a></p>
