In those days (or rather nights), I sat down my pants, creating armies and crushing demons.  Then, having bought Asus Eee 900, having installed Ubuntu, I nasamanil the same heroes there.  But this was not enough.  I really wanted portable heroes that you can play even on the subway, even on pairs, or somewhere else. <br>  And so it happened!  Buying a Nokia E51 phone - searching the Internet - throwing stupid clones into the furnace - and here it is - Age Of Magic (the smartest clone of Heroes Of Might &amp; Magic in symbian 9). <br>  I followed the project for a long time (it is still in development), but now after the release of version 0.08 it has become very similar to its progenitor. <br>  So, under the cut a small review with pictures and my reviews <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  [I want to immediately notify you,% username%, that this article was already on habre, but it was published by my friend <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/yuevelev/" class="user_link">yuevelev</a> , because  I did not have an invite.  now there is an invite, and I just want to move this post to me] <br><br><h6>  <b>What we were promised</b> </h6><br>  This is what the game's website tells us: <br><img src="http://www.aom-game.org/images/aom.png" alt="image"><br>  ‚ÄúThe World of Age of Magic is a world of fairy tales and legends.  It is inhabited by elves, dwarves and other fabulous creatures.  Heroes travel the world in search of treasure and glory. <br>  Magic is the cornerstone in the AoM world.  In total there are 6 schools of magic: earth, water, fire, air, light and darkness. It is impossible to study two schools of opposite directions, for example, knowing the magic of darkness, the magic of light will not be available.  Each race initially has abilities to a certain school of magic. So for people it is water, for elves - light, for necromancers - darkness, for barbarians - fire, etc. <br>  Spells can be purchased in magical guilds in cities or in magical towers found on the map.  In total there are 5 levels of spells, the higher the level, the higher the effect, the higher the cost and the higher the requirements for studying them. <br>  There are 6 types of resources in the game: stone, wood, mercury, sulfur, magic crystals and gold.  Each of the resources is mined in strictly defined places. <br>  Collect resources, build cities, learn magic, hire an army.  Here is the main strategy of the game.  A well-trained hero with a big army is a serious bid to win! ‚Äù

    <h6>  <b>What gave us really</b> </h6><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1a2/5d7/a6b/1a25d7a6b38a1ec07844f1ab47ec37f0.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Initially (i.e., in version 0.07), the general concepts of the game were embodied in the game: movement around the map, collecting resources, building buildings, hiring troops, and so on. <br><br><img src="http://smartic.ru/_ld/13/1326.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/78a/9ee/ad5/78a9eead5c0338cca46017cb26c26f51.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/12f/aef/73f/12faef73f89a3cc37e1c020e886fe77f.jpg" alt="image"><br>  With these functions, the game coped with a bang.  Of course, there was no animation and the sounds were pretty simple, but for a mobile port this is quite normal.  The situation was worse with the battles. <br>  First, the battlefield was not pleased by splitting the battlefield into squares, and not into all the hexagons loved by all.  But this is not the worst.  In the battle could not use spells!  Ie the guild of magicians can be built in the city, but you can not use it.  And this is in a game called Age of <u>Magic</u> .  Thus, the hero has to rely only on the army, but on the recruited talents. <br><img src="http://www.aom-game.org/images/screenshots/9.png" alt="image"><br>  Also from the software glitches the following were observed: periodic disappearance of the character, departure from the game when folding, loss of music, weak AI (although it must be admitted, quite quick) <br>  Periodically going to the forum, I read about the progress on creating version 0.08, and then left for 2 weeks.  And when he returned, he found the latest version and was glad.  That's just for that happy moment, I already used the Nokia 5530 in full, therefore I had to dig out the worn out E51 and try on it. <br><br><h6>  <b>So, what is the game now?</b> </h6><br><img src="http://www.aom-game.org/images/screenshots/2.png" alt="image"><br>  The main thing that I want to mention is, of course, the realization of spells: the guild of magicians, a book of spells, and, of course, their application in battle.  Only 36 spells. <br><img src="http://www.aom-game.org/images/screenshots/12.png" alt="image"><br>  Each sang is provided with a description, generally pleased.  Also added personal perks to characters, added new objects and secondary skills. <br>  Then, finally, the hexagons returned, which brought the game closer to the Heroes by a few more steps. <br><img src="http://www.aom-game.org/images/screenshots/8.png" alt="image"><br>  There was an underground race, castles and other paraphernalia. <br>  What else is very pleased - this is the animation.  And both while viewing the map, and during the battle.  For the mobile port is very, very strong. <br>  Pretty well pulled AI, translated into English and Ukrainian, and for maps localization is possible as much as 30 languages.  Plus added ‚ÄúFull native support for 352x416 screens‚Äù. <br>  At the same time, I would like to note that the performance of the game is at a height: there were no brakes at all. <br>  Some more screenshots: <br><img src="http://www.aom-game.org/images/screenshots/6.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://www.aom-game.org/images/screenshots/5.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://www.aom-game.org/images/screenshots/1.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://www.aom-game.org/images/screenshots/10.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://www.aom-game.org/images/screenshots/7.png" alt="image"><br><br>  It is also impossible to pass by the map editor.  I myself, unfortunately, did not use it, however, according to the reviews on the forum, it was perceived by the public quite favorably. <br><img src="http://smart-planet.ru/uploads/download/obmenpk/thumbs/1262692693_111.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  What is very frustrating is the absolute unplayability on 5800-like devices.  According to the creator of the game (the only one, by the way!), Theoretically such a port is possible, but for this you need to raise money for him to buy a phone with symbian s60v5.  But: <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúPosted: 14 Feb 2010, 01:21</i> <i><br></i>  <i>While only the c60v3 version will develop, there is no time for another.</i>  <i>Although the UIQ3 version could be done of course, it is much easier than on c60b5.</i>  <i>But still the development of aom is more important than the ports. ‚Äù</i> <br><br>  In general, if you take exactly 320 * 240, then the game is just gorgeous, for which I bow to the creator of this miracle, Dmitry Matveyev, aka Beholder. <br>  You can visit the site and the forum <a href="http://aom-game.org/">aom-game.org</a> <br><br><habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/86611/">https://habr.com/ru/post/86611/</a></p>
