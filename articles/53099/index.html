      But‚Ä¶ <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The war for our opinion, the opinion of IT departments and company leaders, is the developers of a particular product.  And if the transition from one machine to another is quite simple, as with phones.  What is most difficult is the transition from one software product to another.  No, of course, I, you - reading Habr, go without difficulty.  But what does an accountant, or secretary, do during this transition? <br><br>  Despite the fact that everywhere there are general principles of window, the location of menus and buttons.  A year ago, when I sat down for the first time on MacOS after Windows, I got used to the fact that the program menu was glued to the top of the screen for a couple of days.  Yes, and there were other moments.  At the same time, I work as a programmer and periodically - I develop interfaces, and I have seen enough. <br><br>  But in any system and program there is something that distinguishes them from competitors.  Moreover, each developer teaches these differences of the interface as something as convenient as possible. <br>  If you think about whether these differences in the system interface are necessary for employees of one or two programs, employees of a few simple functions?  No, they need the opportunity to work.  And when a certain boss decides to make the transition from one OS to another, from one program to another, (and they are usually guided by the financial side of the issue), the surrounding interface changes, which only causes rejection and slowing down. <br><br>  Why then these differences? <br>  Why does a person working with excel only have anything else to do? <br>  Do not need it to them. <br><br>  When changing the machine does not change the basic functionality of the product.  There is a steering wheel, there are pedals, there are doors, there is a gas tank.  Everything else is attached as something optional - and does not slow down the transition.  In software, the opposite is true.  First you need to learn how to use "optional" changes, and only then you can work with the basic functionality. <br><br>  I really hope that at least in 10-20 years we will come to the emergence of other hardware and software products.  For something that will have the basic functionality necessary for work.  And no more.  Because  the rest is in the way. <br>  Perhaps this product will be terminals with some kind of typed server part. <br><br>  I know it looks like an attempt to restrict people from accessing additional features.  But it is the absence of superfluous - the key to the success of our entire planet in the formation of beings.  When you play with a cat or a dog, pay attention to the fact that their breed and color practically do not affect your ability to communicate with them. <br><br>  <b>Footnotes</b> <br>  <sup>1</sup> - The list can be added independently </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/53099/">https://habr.com/ru/post/53099/</a></p>
