Why?  Because they are deprived of life for the right to visit the stadiums.  Therefore, they are buzzing on the euro, on the World Cup, in France.  We also start this: very emotional fans can easily catch a ban on visiting the arena for a long enough period. <br><br>  To begin with, if you go nuts, the security personnel of the stadium will carefully put your biometric data of a person into the video surveillance system according to a legal court decision.  The next time you enter the stadium, they will surely recognize you and inform the security staff.  The issue of personal data and freedom of contract (a ticket is a contract) is resolved elegantly: at the ‚Äúdrunk‚Äù stage, you are simply sued and obtained a conclusion, with which you can proceed.

      In general, there are two myths about safety in stadiums: <br><br><ol><li>  That video surveillance does not help in the prevention of crime. </li><li>  And that biodetectors are the last century. </li></ol><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  "Command Center" </h2><br>  First you should talk about what modern video surveillance is.  If earlier it was an analog TV with a security guard and tape recording, now it is a situational center that coordinates the work of various services, a lot of pattern recognition (automatic detectors based on video stream events), archive search, statistics and a lot of IT in general. <br><br>  In the situational center of the stadium there are usually about 10 operators and representatives of the services - fire, physical security and a police representative.  Operators sit behind the screens of their computers (each has virtual ‚Äúsquares‚Äù) and, if necessary, display a specific situation requiring a reaction on a large video wall.  For example, if a fan sets fire to something on the podium, the fire detection alarm triggers first, the operator sees it, makes sure that this is not a false-positive trigger, and almost immediately, after a couple of seconds, displays this hero on the screen with sector coordinates. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/9m/yt/14/9myt14cumnic0hi9iv0jex1ocx0.jpeg"><br>  <i>This is how this place looks in Krasnodar (commissioning)</i> <br><br>  The security officer takes the walkie-talkie and commands what to do, watching the development of a reality show. <br><br>  The only point is that there are stadiums where the installation costs non-critical violations and not to go and not to provoke fan groups.  Another thing is that the violators will then be sued - just silently, and you can only find out about it by the summons, if the police suddenly decide to detain them hot on the trail. <br><br><h2>  What allows you to automate video surveillance? </h2><br>  There are usually about a thousand cameras in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãresponsibility - you will not always run through the eyes.  Therefore, we need autodetectors - let them not the most accurate, but give the opportunity to focus on 10-15 cameras, and not on a hundred for one operator.  On long shifts, the incidence rate is calculated - 10‚Äì15 incidents per person per hour, otherwise he starts to react poorly and makes mistakes.  More often - gets tired, less often - falls asleep.  For example, at the stadium of CSKA under the supervision of the stands themselves, technical premises, parking, hall and corridors of the hotel.  There we installed 540 surveillance cameras.  And in Krasnodar, we installed 1000 surveillance cameras (this is the stadium and the surrounding area), 9000 fire detectors, 3000 speech annunciators, 600 sensors of security and alarm signaling. <br><br>  The main task of video surveillance is the prosecution and ‚Äúdebriefing‚Äù.  That is, it is believed that it does not help in preventing crimes.  Of course, it helps: if there is someone who is watching the situation in real time and can coordinate the physical security service, this is better than if there is no such supervision.  In fact, we have several frequently used detectors based on pattern and situation recognition: <br><br><ol><li>  <b>The intersection of the lines</b> is the alarm that someone is in the wrong zone.  Often used in data centers and hazardous industries, to save on insurance, but at the stadiums also shows itself well. </li><li>  <b>Detection of abandoned and forgotten things</b> .  If you leave the package or suitcase - the system will give an alarm.  It is actively used at almost all stations and airports, at stadiums - to a lesser extent. </li><li>  <b>Search and record</b> - sorting personnel by orientations (‚Äúred jacket‚Äù, ‚Äúwith dog‚Äù, ‚Äúlow‚Äù, ‚Äúlong hair‚Äù and so on) - if a suspect runs around an object with an orientation, we can quickly find it even in a crowd .  But more often, these detectors are used to search for frames in the archive or count how many times an employee with a dog passed by this camera, for example. </li><li>  <b>Fight detectors</b> - these are still very inaccurate and badly working: on beta tests we could hardly distinguish between friendly hugs, a zombie apocalypse of the type in the metro at rush hour and the kisses of loving couples from normal fights.  Almost not used, but with the development of neural networks - will probably. </li></ol><br>  In general, almost no detectors are used offline.  All of them help to draw the operator‚Äôs attention to something, but the operator himself does his job as usual.  In recent years, everything goes to the fact that the role of the operator will fall: the quality of detectors is growing, and, most likely, automation will soon be able to successfully distinguish most of the dangerous situations without a person. <br><br>  The cameras are located both in the adjacent territory and at the checkpoint, in the stands and in the sub-tribune area.  Stands and CAT are viewed in the highest quality, sufficient for face recognition in the crowd.  You need more than 250 pixels in width for confident identification by the ‚Äúblack list‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/g0/9s/9d/g09s9dmo7wyjjfyx8pbsjrlpwbc.jpeg"><br>  <i>Cameras in the stands of the CSKA stadium</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ha/53/d7/ha53d78kvqp8wbhb22nzo17de1k.jpeg"><br>  <i>An example of the placement of outdoor cameras in the stadium in Krasnodar</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/v8/gq/gd/v8gqgd5abjmcjh9tqoctedriefu.jpeg"><br>  <i>In Krasnodar</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sr/xj/sq/srxjsqdwgyhwcmdx9x5no6_rguo.jpeg"><br>  <i>Here you can see the farm, which later will be placed video cameras</i> <br><br>  That is, it is almost useless to go through other people's documents (fan passport or fan ID) - at the stadiums, where there is a search for people, this will not help. <br><br><h2>  What is on the perimeter? </h2><br>  Now about biodetectors.  But in order to reach them, you need to tell about perimeter security.  It: <br><br><ul><li>  Intersection-protected fences (from cord microphone in the ground to various smart sensors at the top). </li><li>  Barriers of the precautionary and stopping action, bollard. </li><li>  X-ray television installations (introscopes). </li><li>  Arched and hand-held metal detectors. </li><li>  Detectors for explosive and ionizing substances (like at the airport). </li></ul><br>  Explosives detectors are used individually during the passage through the perimeter.  Biodetectors are often used for mass control.  The most common and easy to use are specially trained service dogs. <br><br>  The dog can work in 2 hour shifts in a quiet mode, but the recommendation is to move from exit to exit every 15 minutes.  Therefore, they come, sniff the crowd and, if they do not worry, go on.  Because of the versatility will be used for a long time, I think. <br><br>  According to the FIFA regulations, you need to launch 100% of the fans in an hour.  This is from 45 thousand spectators.  All bags at the entrance pass through the introscope, detectors of explosives and narcotic substances.  But stretch marks, flags, sports accessories - this is registered in advance and rushes with the documentation already.  As a private person, there is little that can be done - it is necessary through the fan club, and there responsibility is, as in the musketeers: ‚Äúall for one‚Äù. <br><br>  For example, at one of the stadiums in Yekaterinburg, we made 16 low-voltage systems, including television broadcasting, satellite reception, sound amplification, monitoring the deformation states of the supporting structures, and systems to counter terrorist attacks.  127 km of cable was used, 48 introscopes were installed, 174 metal detectors - this is enough for all to pass within the standard. <br><br>  In the passport of the fan is a passive RFID tag.  It is read by the ticket system at the entrance and portals at the exit from the stadium.  It is necessary not only to recognize the fans, but also to understand how much it has gone, how much has left, and how much is left under the podium.  If suddenly a fire - at the same time to understand where and how many fans, whom to save from. <br><br><h2>  More features </h2><br>  Situation center standard is duplicated.  If something happens to the main room, you can walk around with the feet of 30‚Äì50 meters and get into the back room, and from there almost without interruption continue the operational management. <br><br>  Now operators control cameras ‚Äî they can twist them, bring them closer.  The interfaces are now more convenient - they began to do with screens and touchpads instead of physical ‚Äúmixing consoles‚Äù.  In the future, it is planned to connect the operator via ethernet to video surveillance, and not necessarily directly from the stadium, but this is already the future. <br><br>  Cameras can send data directly to the Safe City systems.  This means that if you are off the hook - you will be led to the house, passing from camera to camera. <br><br><h2>  Links </h2><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://www.croc.ru/news/detail/66396/">New stadium CSKA</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://www.croc.ru/news/detail/67261/">Stadium of FC "Krasnodar"</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/croc/blog/241305/">How we made the sound for "Discovery"</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/croc/blog/269585/">How we did Wi-Fi for Krasnodar</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/croc/blog/308300/">Face recognition at the entrance and the cat terminator</a> </li><li>  My mail: ITsarev@croc.ru </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/346902/">https://habr.com/ru/post/346902/</a></p>
