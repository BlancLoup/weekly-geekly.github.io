And one day they would not stand it and would go to Google to find out what this service is and why it has such an active advertising campaign.  We live, of course, not in a large Canadian city, but we had a reason to find out as much as possible about myApollo.  Which - tell you a little later, let it be a teaser. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/7a6/166/da1/7a6166da1b1040eb215df01d665b1fd6.png"><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, there is good news: very soon, or rather, at the very beginning of September, we are waiting for the launch of a new social network.  True, it will not be anything fundamentally new, hitherto unseen and revolutionary, but its founders swear that once you try, you will never want any other social networks.  What then is the trick?  Let's take it in order. <br><br>  MyApollo is the brainchild of a startup Arroware from Toronto.  It was founded by two bold guys, Harvey Medcalf and Phil Kinsman, who somehow managed to convince investors that their project is much cooler than Facebook, Dropbox, Google Drive, iTunes and Etsy taken together.  Perhaps, patriotic ambitions of developers played a role: offhand from Canadian IT companies only Blackberry is remembered, and those things are not going well now, so the guys from Toronto are clearly not averse to raising the image of their country. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/be5/96c/70e/be596c70eb536d75053e5d8b182bdb36.png"><br>  <i>Harvey Medcafe, CEO and President of Arroware</i> <br><br>  As usual, one fine day, the future creators of myApollo had a simple idea: why do we communicate with friends, post our photos and videos on one service, and store all our files on another?  Why not combine a platform for communicating with the cloud storage to use only one service?  After all, if you think about it, then with the current development of technologies (and the role that digital data play in our lives) it‚Äôs just not appropriate to have so many accounts on so many sites.  In general, the Canadian guys pondered and came up with a powerful data center, where you can also communicate.

      MyApollo has everything you need to have a modern social network: a ‚Äúwall‚Äù, a personal profile, the ability to correspond with other people, quote, rate, share photos - but all this is served under the sauce of cloud storage.  That is, unlike Facebook, you can even share files of large sizes: hourly presentation video or portfolio, collected over ten years of work. <br><br>  According to the guys from Arroware, they simply took and removed all the artificial restrictions that developers of existing platforms and even manufacturers of hardware put in the way of Internet users.  As befits a cloud service, myApollo offers a single file storage with easy access from any computer and mobile device.  Roughly speaking, from anywhere in the world, a user can write a post on his page and immediately illustrate it with a couple (dozens) of music tracks from those stored in his cloud storage.  Well, or send one of the contacts in myApollo your entire photo album for several tens of gigabytes - let them see at once with whom they are dealing.  According to the official website of the service, applications for iOS, Android, Windows and OSX are under development. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/176/88c/7b0/17688c7b0c7c6b7776aa1864af089d05.png"><br>  On the one hand, there is nothing new, and all these services have existed for a long time, but so far they are not just on one platform, but also at the distance of one click - not yet.  For example, service developers see the possibility of using myApollo as a platform for the demonstration and sale by creatives of their own graphic works: you can store high-resolution images and source codes of design layouts and discuss conditions with customers within one service, and absolutely free. <br><br>  By the way, the creators of the project promise that they don‚Äôt collect information about users ‚Äúto the left‚Äù, everything is as transparent and safe as possible.  They plan to get profit only from placing banners and targeted advertising.  But the service does not have a specific target audience, at least so the developers themselves say, - as they say, young people everywhere have a way, the elderly always have honor. <br><br>  It would seem that the idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãmyApollo lay on the surface: the guys just took and connected in one service what the modern Internet user needs, without inventing anything new.  But we know that the new is not only the well-forgotten old, but also with the mind the updated actual.  Just give people what they want - it's simple.  So, it seems, Jobs still spoke, and he knew a lot about positioning.  True, a reasonable question arises: how to squeeze into the already filled market of social services, cloud storages and file-washing machines, because the average user will not be easy to explain than myApollo is better than other social networks.  In short, we need a powerful PR campaign, which is what the startupers are doing right now.  And then it‚Äôs already a matter of ‚Äúsmall‚Äù - to launch, finally, a service, attract users and not scare them away with minor flaws, which are inevitable in the initial stages of the existence of any project.  But in the guys from Arroware we believe. <br><br>  Oh yes, you probably want to ask for a long time why we are writing about some kind of social network in the Dell corporate blog?  It's simple: myApollo uses our servers to process and store that huge amount of data that happy users will share with each other on a new site.  Dell designed a flexible infrastructure for myApollo, the capacity of which can be gradually increased as the platform evolves.  It includes the latest servers, drives and network devices that provide reliable data protection and are highly resilient.  The service will run on <a href="http://www.dell.com/ru/business/p/poweredge-m620/pd%3Frefid%3Dpoweredge-m620%26baynote_bnrank%3D0%26baynote_irrank%3D1%26~ck%3DdellSearch%26isredir%3Dtrue">Dell M620</a> blades installed in racks M1000E.  The network infrastructure will use Dell Force10 switches, in particular, Force10 MXL, Force10 S4810, Force10 S50N and Force10 S60N.  And do not forget about the most reliable storage Dell. <br><br>  In general, we are waiting for the ‚ÄúX‚Äù date (the launch of the Android application is <a href="http://www.betakit.com/new-social-network-myapollo-launching-on-android-september-6/">already scheduled</a> for September 6) and see what happened with Arroware.  Perhaps we will be involved in creating a new Facebook or, even better, a new Google. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/192226/">https://habr.com/ru/post/192226/</a></p>
