Nestollman</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <i>Note</i>  <i>Trans.: All this is sad irony.</i>  <i>And to some extent a parody of <a href="http://stallman.org/stallman-computing.html">Stallman.</a></i> <br>  I use an HP laptop with Windows installed on it.  I do not know exactly what kind of model laptop.  He is blue.  I also have some kind of Galaxy, from which I constantly go online. <br><br>  I chose Windows, because the laptop came with a pre-installed system, and with a bunch of useful software from HP, through which I can connect to a wireless network and play DVD-shki.  I do not understand why there are no such programs in Windows initially. <br><br>  I do all my work in Word or PowerPoint.  These are wonderful programs.  In Word, I write letters, notes, reports, and make posters for my gardening club.  I like Word because it gives everyone the opportunity to feel like a graphic designer.  I love to use WordArt everywhere - it makes my work special, outstanding.  Thanks to my PowerPoint presentations, I‚Äôll capture the attention of the audience.  I like to make presentations interesting to others.  To do this, I use a lot of different colors and fonts on each slide, while not forgetting to make sure that the words are stylized scattered among interesting icons. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I use email mainly for registration on various sites.  I have a mailbox on Gmail.  I never bothered to connect my account to Outlook and check my mail through the web interface.  I never download attachments in letters from strangers.  If I know a person and he sends me an email with attachments, then of course I will download.  I love getting archives with funny pictures.  Sometimes letters from friends come in with a warning about fraud, where people lie, for example, that their car has broken down.  I forward these letters to all my friends so that they also know about the danger.

      I get a lot of spam, and I don't know why.  I am not a fool and do not transfer money to the ‚Äúsick in Nigeria‚Äù.  But when messages about various contests come, I participate - who will refuse the new macbook? <br><br>  Internet on my laptop is really slow.  Plus it is quite difficult to climb the sites because of the toolbars that eat off the half-screen.  Also, when I work on the Internet, I get annoyed by pop-ups inviting adult dating sites and online gambling.  I received a lot of annoying messages on the Internet about the dangers of ActiveX, but a friend showed me how to change the security settings so that they no longer interfere. <br><br>  I use all social networks.  I have two hundred friends on Facebook.  On Twitter and Google+, I follow some celebrities I‚Äôm interested in.  On Twitter, I follow 500 people, and in Google+ circles I have 600 people.  I don't write to Twitter very often, so only 6 people read me.  Yes, and they write me only invitations to dating sites and online games. <br><br>  When I'm online, I'm constantly logged in to Facebook, Google, and Twitter.  It's easier to like your favorite videos.  In addition, I do not have to constantly enter passwords.  My password is easily remembered - this is the name of my cat and the birthday of my son.  Friends warn that it is not safe, but ... Who needs me? <br><br>  I love to post pictures of my cat and of my son in Facebook, especially from the birthday.  Facebook is cool.  I have a Facebook client on the phone.  I post something there ten times a day, and only here I communicate with friends and family.  In Facebook, I throw all my photos.  I am also checked when I am in some interesting place or when I go on vacation for a couple of weeks. <br><br>  Sometimes Facebook is not so good, especially when you are bullied by those who disagree with you.  I hate bullies and always put them in their place, showing that they are wrong. <br><br>  I am very careful when using the computer and constantly check whether the antivirus works.  I have AVG, AVAST, Norton, Microsoft Security Essentials and some other ones that I downloaded from sites that detected viruses on my laptop.  I do not update the antivirus, but just close the annoying reminders about the update.  And in general, this is a rip-off - to demand to buy a new version.  I'm not some kind of hacker who does not understand what. <br><br>  I am also very careful with my files.  There are two folders on my computer.  In one, all my files, and in another, I throw backup copies of files in case I accidentally delete them.  I also tried to save backups to a USB flash drive, but I constantly forgot to do it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/191940/">https://habr.com/ru/post/191940/</a></p>
