How to develop your business when financial issues are not resolved?  You have to find a way, and better not one. <br><br>  Based on my experience, here are <b>four key things</b> you should pay close attention to. <br>  It was precisely a clear understanding and adherence to these principles that allowed me to develop my business from scratch and scale it to the <b>network of city portals "Gorodor"</b> .

    <a name="habracut"></a>  <b>1. Force yourself to move forward.</b> <br><br>  Many people invent new ideas for their young companies, are constantly looking for brilliant solutions and at the same time ... They do nothing at all, because they decide that it is not worth their efforts, or they do not have the proper level of skills ... Stop searching for excuses.  Act, try!  Be persistent! <br>  Excessive analysis, most often, leads to paralysis.  Start moving forward and over time you will not be able to stop, do not allow your indecision to postpone everything until better times. <br><br>  <b>2. Focus and be ready to develop.</b> <br><br>  Choose one thing and find a way to do it better than anyone else.  At the same time, do not dwell.  Your first idea may not fade, but the 30th is easy! <br><br>  Be flexible enough, adapt to changing conditions, develop.  As an entrepreneur, your task is to exhaust all possible options and find the only true one that will bring you success. <br>  Sometimes, it is tempting to do several things at once, for example, to provide several versatile services.  But at the start, this can lead to fragmentation of your business and not bring proper success, which would be if you focused on one thing and brought this business to perfection. <br><br>  Do not try to please everyone, do one thing, but perfect. <br><br>  It is best to enter a niche with a huge formed market that is constantly growing and changing, this will give you a much better chance of success.  Today, almost every new company must adjust its business plan in the development process.  You need a place to make a mistake.  A large, dynamic market gives you the opportunity to try different ideas and discover unforeseen opportunities. <br><br>  <b>3. Make Connections</b> <br><br>  The development of a wide network of connections will have a positive impact on personal and professional growth.  Each other employee or family member can at any time introduce you, for example, to the first investor. <br><br>  <b>4. Do not back down or give up.</b> <br><br>  All successful entrepreneurs have one common quality - they never give up. <br>  As you move forward, more and more reasons will appear in front of you why your idea and business will not work, and much less often why it will work. <br><br>  Be patient, listen only to yourself and go ahead, do not let other people manipulate you. <br><br>  <i>Remember, this is your idea, your business and your vision.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Success is a diligent reward.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299962/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299962/</a></p>
