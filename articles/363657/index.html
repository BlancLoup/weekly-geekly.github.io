We, of course, do not impose our point of view on anyone, but <b>it seems to us that Oliver‚Äôs experience can be used in almost all industries (both in his personal life and in his career)</b> , especially since his presentation of the material is quite casual and not similar to monotone notation.  The article below was discussed by our team.  We will be glad if you share your opinion.  So, truly Bond plots, but ... a little more flexibility and fun.  The villains from the world of Bond are a little bit boring. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Our villain is a businessman-spender and / or scientific genius, charming, daring, with titanium self-confidence, who is ready to challenge the whole world and who has managed to find his vocation.  Imagine Tony Stark in real life.  Like all "good" villains, our Tony has the most noble intentions.  He is eager to make the world better and knows what he is really capable of doing. <br><br>  <b>What did this remind us of?</b>  Nothing more than our own thoughts during the development phase of the Witget service.  We also wanted to somehow change the world, more precisely, our world of progress.  And at some point, we realized that we could benefit people who faced the same problems as we do.  Yes, we earn on it, as well as Tony Stark on our technologies, which will be discussed below.

      What benefits can be gained from this?  You need to understand that you can earn money by solving for others the task that you have already successfully solved for yourself.  Not the fact that many have thought of this before.  Maybe you will be the founder of the new market? <br><br>  Tony was born in New York, where he had a good future.  Soon it becomes clear that he is able to build a world techno-empire.  By the time the world's oil resources are almost depleted, Tony is developing a revolutionary new form of sustainable energy.  The Middle East is plunging into military conflict for several years, and thanks to the use of Stark's inventions, the countries of the world manage to recover.  And people, for the most part, are grateful to him.  In his 40 years, Tony owns a state comparable to the current wealth of Buffett and Gates.  But success is tiring, and Tony switches to something else.  Extreme poverty in the African continent - this is what he considers the biggest ulcer on the body of the world.  Tony decides to put an end to this, and believes that he will succeed. <br><br>  <u><b>What did that remind us of?</b></u>  We also met and began to work together in the metropolis - Moscow.  Only not in the field of oil refining, but in the field of Internet marketing, which today is one of the most important for many companies, because, as Gates once said, those who are not on the Internet can assume that they are not in business. <br><br>  <u><b>What benefits can be gained from this?</b></u>  We must understand that you should not get hung up on one area of ‚Äã‚Äãactivity, ignoring everything else.  Who knows, what if everything will turn out better than you can dream of? <br><br>  Tony sees only a radical solution to the issue: the construction of a new city - and Tony is ready to take on its financing.  He offers several African countries to hire hundreds of thousands of local citizens, whom he will train, and to attract foreign specialists to build a city where millions of people will be provided with housing and work. <br><br>  As part of the deal, Tony reserves 20% of the central territory, the rest of the land he gives to the people who helped build the city.  In exchange, Tony asks for substantial tax breaks and political concessions, including the legalization of any scientific research. <br><br>  <u><b>What did that remind us of?</b></u>  Very similar to how we attracted our investor angels.  And on how they participated in contests and accelerator. <br><br>  <u><b>What benefits can be gained from this?</b></u>  If you believe in your idea, you should: <br>  ‚Ä¢ confirm its ‚Äúprofessional suitability‚Äù with the help of independent experts (this is good for contests; if your idea is bad, you will be told about it and you will understand what to change (or abandon the project at all!)); <br>  ‚Ä¢ do not be afraid to attract investors, even if it means that you have to say goodbye to something (for example, complete freedom in making decisions or part of future income), because otherwise you can be left with nothing. <br><br>  Despite major doubts, contradictions and accusations of imperialism, the plan is accepted.  Ten years later, thanks to modern building technologies, a new metropolis appears.  In the meantime, Tony enjoys the benefits gained by investing heavily in genetic research that is prohibited in the rest of the world ‚Äî in particular, with respect to changes in the human genome. <br><br>  This activity does not go unnoticed.  Influential people in the United States see Tony as a threat to the future of all mankind.  His company produces revolutionary medical products one after another - the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, a simple injection, restoring damaged heart tissue.  But all this causes a hostile response: does the end justify the means?  Many countries, in response to growing public discontent, declare these products illegal, ignoring the needs of their populations. <br><br>  Of course, business for Tony is extremely important.  The growing tension only helps his city - popularly known as Stark - to become the most desirable place to live in the whole world.  Tony moves there, continuing to expand his company. <br><br>  Soon his scientific developments allow you to change the genes of living people, and even unborn.  People can now ‚Äúoptimize‚Äù their DNA with a simple blood scan and a synthesized viral injection. <br><br>  Here the world could not stand it. <br><br>  With this development, the population of the city of Starck and many new neighboring cities can get rid of virtually all congenital malformations, diseases, low intelligence, physical disabilities, as well as increase life expectancy.  Soon the technology allows to develop extraordinary intellectual abilities, to increase the eidetic memory and the regulation of motor movement.  Changing your DNA is now the same thing as updating an operating system. <br><br>  All countries of the world are in a panic, and especially the USA.  It soon became clear that it was not enough to make this technology illegal.  Anyone who has undergone the ‚Äúoptimization‚Äù procedure can earn a lot of money being donors of sperm and eggs.  The public begins to come out with a request to protect the gene pool, there are growing fears that ‚Äúnormal‚Äù people will soon disappear - as a result, it was decided to close the borders and ban all these drugs.  Countries are against Stark almost belligerent. <br><br>  Tony is not a fool: when the inevitable happens, he turns out to be well prepared. <br><br>  The USA imitate the prevented act of terrorism on its territory.  Using this as a pretext, a coalition of US and EU forces is eagerly preparing for the invasion of the city of Stark to overthrow it by force. <br><br>  Unfortunately for them, it is here that genius becomes a villain. <br><br>  The military of the future is not very different from its current level: the United States still surpasses all other countries of the world combined, and their power is almost entirely provided by drones and long-range missiles.  The city of Stark, in fact, does not have any military force, with the exception of the police and security services, who immediately settled on the border. <br><br>  In a word, the first attack was predictable, although cruel: since the enemy had no military targets, the coalition launched a strike against aviation, industrial and energy complexes.  But it was not important. <br><br>  US drones began to fall from the sky with stones, and the rockets, having made a loop, crashed into the ocean.  The country easily reflected the attacks of all automated equipment that the coalition was able to mobilize: electromagnetic radiation, interference from satellites, remote capture of computers and communications. <br><br>  It is clear that the countermeasures were not flawless, and hundreds of people died.  Nevertheless, a simple city was able to inflict significant damage to a large military armada. <br><br>  Now Tony broadcasts a message to the whole world, and his voice sounds against the background of a video sequence with mutilated and charred corpses of civilians.  ‚ÄúMany of you consider us evil.  But we live peacefully and in isolation, and our only crime is a scientific practice that can put an end to diseases and enrich the lives of future generations.  For this, your governments bring death to our people.  Ask yourself: Is this what you really want?  After all, what is happening is the business of their hands.  We will not stop until they retreat. ‚Äù <br><br>  For an hour the world stopped waiting. <br><br>  Tony was not difficult to find his proxies, and mostly they were smart, nosy and organized people.  In just a few hours, they damaged the communication, commercial and transport systems of the coalition countries, in effect, destroying the power of the enemy. <br><br>  The conflict continued, but not for too long.  Any attempts to recover and strike back were immediately weakened by Stark‚Äôs technical superiority.  When Tony defeated the system of foreign satellites at the right moment, the coalition gave the order to retreat. <br><br>  Frustrated and wounded, the world admitted defeat. <br><br>  For several years, the ideological opposition to technology and even Stark's methods has faded in the face of their practical advantages.  One by one, the countries lifted restrictions on his scientific developments, control over gene purity became inexpedient and then completely impossible.  Soon Tony became an example for those peoples who had previously opposed him.  He found his winning strategy. <br><br>  It may seem that this victory is rather one-sided, but think about it: Tony died in old age, being the richest of all people who have ever lived, became almost the king of his own state, and, finally, he could forever change the very nature of humanity.  In a literal sense, he defied the whole world - and won. <br><br>  <b>What did that remind us of?</b>  Probably, we thought that it was impossible to stop, encountering difficulties in the form of refusals in financing, not quite the profitability results that we dreamed of, etc.  And most importantly - one should not be afraid of criticism, if there is confidence in the correctness of the general idea.  It needs to be improved to take any blows from the outside fully armed! <br><br>  <i><b>As one wise man (Harvey Dent (Two-faced)) said: ‚ÄúYou either die a hero or you live until you become a villain.‚Äù</b></i> <br><br>  The statement is quite controversial.  But ... would it have benefited Tony and everyone who believed in him if he decided to die a hero?  It is worth thinking, is it possible to give up if there is a team behind you who believes in you ?! <br><br>  What do you think? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/363657/">https://habr.com/ru/post/363657/</a></p>
