  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Wired has published its list of winners and losers of Web 2.0</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Wired magazine held a <a href="">popular vote</a> and identified the best and worst Web 2.0 generation sites. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  If you analyze this list, you can clearly see that Web 2.0 really carries a lot of new interesting ideas.  But even more bad ideas.  Wired magazine publishes a <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,71810-0.html">list of ten Web 2.0 sites</a> , including the top five and five worst.  Of course, this is just the tip of the iceberg, the ‚Äúreal‚Äù list of winners and losers of Web 2.0 is much longer. <br>  Such sites are selected, which are most characteristic as examples. <br><br>  <b>Winners</b> <br><br>  Photo <a href="http://www.flickr.com/">service Flickr</a> .  One of the best Web 2.0 generation sites.  If a newcomer who is not well versed in modern Internet technologies asks what tags are and why there are so many conversations around them, it is enough just to show him Flickr and everything becomes clear right away.  This site is one of the best examples of semantic web categorization.  Other benefits of Flickr: open software interfaces, the ability to license photos under Creative Commons, numerous functions for building social networks within the user community.

      Podcasting terminal <a href="http://www.odeo.com/">Odeo</a> .  When the first podcasts appeared a few years ago, immediately there was a misconception that podcasting is very difficult, and to record podcasts you need expensive equipment and complex programs.  And then the Odeo service appeared - and all these myths were immediately dispelled.  On this site you can record and publish your podcast without closing the browser.  All operations are carried out through the Flash-module, moreover, the company distributes &lt;a <br>  href = " <a href="http://studio.odeo.com/create/home">studio.odeo.com/create/home</a> "&gt; program with which you can record and publish podcasts directly from a mobile phone, that is, even a microphone for podcasting is not needed. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.writely.com/">Writely</a> text editor: a great alternative to MS Word.  Soon, Web 2.0 services can completely supplant traditional PC office applications.  The mail program and text editor are already feeling great in the role of web applications that work through the browser and support almost all the basic functions of their offline "competitors". <br><br>  The online bookmarking service <a href="http://del.icio.us/">Del.icio.us</a> has become for many users an absolutely indispensable tool in everyday work.  On the pages of this public site they keep links to any valuable content that they find on the web.  Publishing links is a matter of one click on the proprietary toolbar.  You can follow what your friends have found on the Web and read RSS feeds on selected tags. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.netvibes.com/">NetVibes</a> personal aggregator is a descendant of monstrous portals of the past.  On huge sites, some of which have survived to the present day, you can find absolutely any information: read the news, check the weather, get to know your horoscope and explore the latest sports results.  The French web service NetVibes enables each user to create his own personal portal and place on it only the information that he wants to see. <br><br>  <b>Losers</b> <br><br>  The main "loser" of the Web 2.0 was the social service <a href="http://www.myspace.com/">MySpace</a> .  Not for the first time, he is recognized as such, and deservedly so.  Suffice it to recall the recent history of the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/article/387/">banner, which infected more than a million MySpace users</a> . <br><br>  How can you call an unsuccessful service, the audience of which is 100 million people?  It turns out you can.  Objectively, this site is very inconvenient interface, and advertising is too intrusive, not to mention the animation and sound that run automatically.  But, unfortunately, this is exactly what the million-strong army likes of the so-called ‚Äúlemmings,‚Äù that is, inexperienced Internet users, mostly from among teenagers. <br><br>  The expert site <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/">Squidoo</a> invented the original concept of "lenses" for publishing content on any topic.  An expert in a particular area started a ‚Äúlens‚Äù where he collected links to valuable content in a particular area, and also received a percentage of advertising revenue from his page.  But it soon became clear that this concept is good only in theory.  In practice, many sections of the site have become advertising garbage.  Most of the rest of the "lenses" were no more useful than the usual Google search.  The best experts, as it turned out, can earn no more than $ 30, that is, much less than they can get from their own expert blog. <br><br>  Another candidate for the title of "loser" - a very recent novelty, supposedly anonymous <a href="http://www.browzar.com/">Browzar</a> browser, which automatically erases cookies and history of surfing.  Again, theoretically, the idea may seem good (ensuring user privacy), but in practice the browser is not able to completely remove the cache and history of visits.  Worse, it sends users to the company search page, freaked out by contextual advertising. <br><br>  Site <a href="http://fo.rtuito.us/">Fo.rtuito.us</a> is a very strange implementation of a social network.  Instead of bringing people together, this service selects friends for you in a completely random way. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.friendster.com/">Friendster</a> is one of the first social networks on the Internet.  Unfortunately, this service could not endure its popularity.  The servers did not cope with the load, and the problems lasted several months in a row.  In the end, users are tired of it, and as soon as MySpace appeared with the same functionality, most went there. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4426/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4426/</a></p>
