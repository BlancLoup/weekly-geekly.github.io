And the impending "demographic hole" associated with a decline in the birth rate in the 90s can make the situation quite critical.  That is, any plans for the innovative development of the Russian economy can simply be broken about the reality in which every year less and less students graduate from universities and there are questions about the quality of their IT education.  The main problem of the current situation is that the schools teach one, use the Unified State Exam to test the second, study the third in universities, and from scratch, while IT companies need something else altogether. <br><br>  That is why the association of enterprises of computer and information technologies (APKIT) has offered the state its assistance in the formation of school and university educational standards.  The Committee on Education of APCIT is headed by 1C Director Boris Nuraliev, he also oversees the university program.  The school program is supervised by the CEO of the ABBYY group of companies Sergey Andreev.  It was they who last week received informatics teachers at the ABBYY office within the framework of the conference ‚ÄúModern Information Technologies and IT Education‚Äù. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  In one day, we had two thematic sections: ‚ÄúSchool educational standards and computer science programs‚Äù and ‚ÄúTrends in the development of the IT industry.  The need for professional staff.  Specialties in IT "

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/109e7805/34b215b3/bd065bd6/e0fcf054.jpg"><br><br>  The discussion in the first section was very versatile.  The CEO of the ABBYY group of companies, Sergey Andreev, spoke about how the commission‚Äôs work on the formation of the Federal State Educational Standard (Federal State Educational Standard) of secondary education and what changes in the subject matter on computer science are expected.  The head of the federal committee of KIM developers (testing and measuring materials) of the EGE, Mikhail Roitberg, shared information about the new principles for the formation of test tasks and the main sections of the state exam in computer science. <br><br>  They said that learning should be consistent and consistent.  In elementary school, you need to make a good computer science course and include computer skills in all school subjects.  In high school, profiling is now being introduced and students interested in IT can choose an in-depth study of computer science in grades 10-11.  Then students must pass the exam, which corresponds to the program passed. <br><br>  After that, they moved from theory to practice. <br><br>  First, Sergey Shedov, chairman of the methodical commission of the Center for New Pedagogical Technologies, spoke about his experience in extracurricular teaching on the subject using the example of the Mytishchi School of Programmers (IWE) created by him.  The experience is very valuable, since, without selecting talented children from all over the country, and working exclusively with schoolchildren Mytishch, MSP succeeds in achieving serious success at Russian and international computer science competitions, and we are pleased that this person also teaches at the ABBYY department at the faculty Innovation and high technology MIPT. <br><br>  After that, Denis Kiriyenko, a teacher at school No. 179 in Moscow, a specialist in the development of test tasks from the Federal Institute of Pedagogical Measurements, told the audience about why to start learning programming, choose Python, why this language is so close for children to understand and why Having got acquainted with it, it will be easier for them to develop, mastering other languages ‚Äã‚Äãand technologies if there is a desire to become a developer. <br><br>  The second section began with a report by Mikhail Batashan (from 1C) on the work on creating professional standards for higher education APCIT.  After the end of the meeting, guests were invited to a round table on the topic ‚ÄúProfessions in IT‚Äù.  Here representatives of the most diverse specialties from our development teams joined the audience.  Analysts, project managers, interface designers, technical writers, marketers, testing specialists told the teachers about their tasks, work methods and the skills necessary to achieve goals.  Without any of these people, it is not enough to graduate a single IT product, and after all, our institutions of higher education produce not all of the above (and not specified) specialties! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/c88923fe/c7353a69/5bee274a/800bd520.jpg"><br><br>  We wanted to tell teachers that there are various important specialties in IT and that for many of them programming skills are not required, although the basic concepts are very useful in order to understand each other and all participants in the product creation process.  As for future developers, sometimes it does not matter what language they are taught to program in school.  The main thing is for the guys to understand the general principles of constructing algorithms, and they can be comprehended by the example of any language. <br><br>  At the end of the day, the guests were told about the research conducted by ABBYY: about our recognition technologies and achievements in the field of computational linguistics.  During a small tour of the office, anyone could look at how we work, meet and talk with our employees.  We also showed the premises of our department, in which some wards of our guests will probably study in some time. <br><br>  We hope that teachers left us with the desire to tell their students about how an IT company works and to transfer the friendly creative atmosphere that prevails in our office, to schools in general, and to computer science lessons in particular.  After all, it is in just a few years that this may affect which specialists will work with us. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/a2a49922/05716680/352d89a2/1e601588.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/b1eeb54a/00c93581/4141964c/0f2ca9b9.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/f80a4202/f2cb4d94/6e335f04/cea788e1.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/b33c8124/4b0a3e77/9442b700/796af48b.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/1cab68ba/17ea93f4/9bfffede/6f7ebf36.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/414bdcec/3e9e55ef/f8771435/b30dc2f1.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/13b4e1e1/08bc7c2d/ca75c9b2/f99b1c84.jpg"><br><br>  <i>Dmitry Gritsan</i> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/dimonline/" class="user_link">dimonline</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/133060/">https://habr.com/ru/post/133060/</a></p>
