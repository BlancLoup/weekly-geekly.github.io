On Wednesday, August 29, she was sentenced to 4 years in prison. <br><br>  Hanyang Jin was arrested as early as 2007, at the Chicago O'Hare Airport.  She had a one-way ticket to China and, according to the prosecution, Motorola‚Äôs commercial information, which was valued at tens of millions of dollars.

      And that's what happened. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Shortly before her arrest, Jin went to work with a sick-list (tuberculosis + meningitis).  Prosecutors claim that Jin, who worked at Motorola for 9 years, intended to hand over to the Chinese side a number of confidential documents belonging to the company. <br><br>  According to them, she kept the documents in her laptop, plus on several external hard drives.  When she was detained at the airport, she had $ 31,000 with her. <br><br>  Prosecutors believe that Jin planned everything in advance ‚Äî sick leave, return from China to the United States in order to appropriate information, and so on.  As for information, by the way, this is iDEN, a technology that allows you to use a cell phone as a walkie-talkie.  There is an opinion that this would be useful for the Chinese military. <br><br>  Lawyers Gene recognize this version is not very well-off, because at the moment the technology can be considered obsolete, and the good of it would be enough. <br><br>  In February, District Judge Ruben Castillo found Jin guilty of stealing trade secrets.  At the same time, there was another point of accusation, a more serious one - in economic espionage in favor of another state.  But Castillo reasoned that there was no evidence that Jin had any intention to transfer the data to a foreign state. <br><br>  Jin, on the whole, went into complete denial, calls the Motorola bosses paranoid, and is sure that she is being blamed unfairly. <br><br>  ‚ÄúYes, they are paranoid!  I have a fatal illness altogether, I almost died! ‚Äù <br><br>  She admits only that she took these documents.  However, she argues this desire to update their knowledge after the hospital, and not to flee to China with important secrets. <br><br>  The prosecution retorted - at that time, Jin began working for the Chinese communication company Sun Kaisens (working for the benefit of the Chinese armed forces), for which she assigned other people's secrets.  They asked for a gin of 8 years in prison. <br><br>  Taking into account the time spent in custody, yesterday Jean was sentenced to 4 years. <br><br>  Careful come back from the hospital, friends. <br><br>  <a href="http://mashable.com/2012/08/29/motorola-secrets-thief/">via</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/150484/">https://habr.com/ru/post/150484/</a></p>
