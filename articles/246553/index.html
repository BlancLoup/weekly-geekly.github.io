  <section class="page js-page"><h1>IT distribution in Europe or how we started our business - Part 1</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  My story began 9 years ago, exactly at the moment when I decided to move from Russia to the Czech Republic (Prague) to continue my studies at a higher educational institution on a budgetary basis.  Our family did not live richly and many joys of children's life passed by, this was especially noticeable against the background of the children of the ‚Äúsailors‚Äù, whose fathers in the nineties and zero were paid in foreign currency and could afford a lot.  In this regard, after graduating from high school, I had a ‚Äúclear idea‚Äù in my head that I had to earn so much that my children did not need anything, getting the best money could buy. <br><br><h4>  First attempt at writing </h4><br>  I do not know whether this is good or bad, but my head is constantly filled with various ideas.  At the initial stage of building my own business, I had to choose from a huge number of various options, and, often, I caught myself thinking that I was starting to develop the next idea without fully understanding the first one.  Or, sitting at the dinner table, could throw a fork and run into a computer, frantically grabbing the air and picking up another request to google with shaking hands, in order to find out about the concept that came to my mind as much as possible.  As a result, back in 2007, I borrowed $ 500 and decided to engage in retail trade in Chinese phones and accessories.  The IT field attracted me the most, I could spend hours searching for interesting products and negotiating with suppliers.  Now this will not surprise anyone, but then it was a breakthrough.  Purchases over the Internet were just beginning to gain momentum, and only a few worked with China (especially in the Czech Republic). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/797/fa7/def/797fa7defd8c366b4d56a6830c797b25.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I found a reliable partner of <a href="http://www.focalprice.com/">Focalprice</a> , who had a comfortable admin panel and the possibility of <a href="http://members.focalprice.com/My/Order/DropShip/Introduce">dropshipping</a> , in case the business goes uphill.  The store spun on the standard scheme - the <a href="http://vk.com/">VKontakte</a> group, the purchase of accessories on my modest budget and the delivery of telephones to order.  During the first 4 months of work, I managed to collect about 1,500 subscribers in the group, sending out invitations by hand every day and selling about 20 phones.  I earned every 30-50%.  If you look from the outside, it may seem that this is a very good perk for the student, requiring virtually no cash investment, but this is so, but this is only the ‚Äútip of the iceberg.‚Äù  Under the "water" was a huge reservoir of work and time spent.  By approximate estimations it turned out like this:

After some time, my wife came across an <a href="http://www.ioffer.com/">iOffer</a> portal, which operated like an <a href="http://www.ebay.com/">ebay</a> auction or an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a> store, with one, but very significant difference. They sold copies of A ++ brand products.  The designation A ++ says that the copies are almost impossible to distinguish from the original, but at the same time the price was 5 or even 10 times lower.  As well as the portal <a href="https://www.fastcardtech.com/">Fastcardtech</a> , where it was possible to find not only Chinese samples of electronics, but also very good copies of the original telephone.  Then I realized - this is just what I need, and the adventures were not long in coming. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/048/82e/185/04882e185d5e7d63e0e3164703d0f077.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  <b>In continuation <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/246629/">(Part 2)</a> :</b> </h4><br><ul><li>  Threats from buyers </li><li>  Ride with bandits in a jeep </li><li>  Check with Armani Watches </li><li>  Letter from Nokia </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/246553/">https://habr.com/ru/post/246553/</a></p>
