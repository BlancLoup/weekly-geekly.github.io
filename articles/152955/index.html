Suddenly poor feedback, problems with the customer or colleagues, did not raise wages, strange bugs, sudden overtime or project closure - such events trigger a chain of reactive reactions: <br><br><ul><li>  No, there is a mistake -&gt; the bastards themselves -&gt; and maybe things are not so bad -&gt; gut -&gt; okay, let's get out </li></ul><br>  In this chain, a person behaves reactively, predictably ... and, often, does stupid things.  It resembles a state machine, the entrance to which is an unexpected event.  The state of the machine is a chain of psychological defenses: denial, anger, bargaining and depression, and the way out is the adoption of new information. <br>  Of these states often have to pull colleagues, customers, and himself. <br>  Under habrakatom, in addition to the description of the stages, there are answers to the questions: <br><br><ul><li>  How to know each state and predict the following? </li><li>  How to help get yourself and your interlocutor from the chain? </li><li>  What not to do so as not to aggravate the situation? </li></ul><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Examples: how it all begins? </h3><br>  It all starts with the news.  Most often - with the bad. <br><ul><li>  Sometimes, such news comes to us: <br><ul><li>  A colleague comes in and says that he did not have time to finish the piece, which we will show to customers in half an hour. </li><li>  The customer writes that there is an urgent need to finish something else on trifles.  And these little things are such that for a couple of weeks of work they pull. </li><li>  Alarm clock rings </li></ul><br></li><li>  Sometimes, such news has to tell us: <br><ul><li>  Vasya, what you wrote is no good.  Rewrite this smelly piece over the weekend. </li><li>  John, we don't have time to finish in October.  Let's move the release date to next year. </li><li>  Honey, I have an important meeting today, so go to the theater without me. </li></ul></li></ul><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1a2/61f/439/1a261f4396d01ac91ca08eff5d9a24a8.png"></div><br>  When a person receives such news, he goes through a sequence of denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance.  At each stage there are signs and options for action - working and not.

    <h2>  Negation </h2><br><h3>  Examples </h3><br><ul><li>  The team says it will have time before the release.  Although the schedule shows that even a miracle will not save. </li><li>  I do not want to read a letter from the customer or pick up the phone </li><li>  I really don't want to get up on an alarm clock. </li><li>  I do not want to do unpleasant things either.  Since for IT people ‚Äúunpleasant things‚Äù is often a synonym for ‚Äúgoing to conflict‚Äù, the beginning of the conflict is postponed until the last: we don‚Äôt tell the wife realistic home release dates, the customer has a plausible release date, and a broken slave about overtime and future dismissal. </li><li>  One acquaintance of PM told me that somehow he received feedback from the customer with the minimum possible rating of his work as PM.  His first thought was "this is a mistake."  And with this thought he lived for several days, although his superiors convinced that there was no mistake, and that this was a problem and that she needed to be addressed. </li><li>  When I was told that I needed an operation, I thought that it was a mistake.  I thought that there were ways to avoid it, and went to do another X-ray with the belief that he would put everything in its place. </li><li>  Steve Jobs found cancer at a very early stage.  He did not believe in the disease until it was too late. </li><li>  And come on, maybe we somehow get tense and still have time on time? </li></ul><br><h3>  Description </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/41f/eb5/969/41feb596977cad1283198fda42d49242.png"><br>  <i>The horse just does not ride.</i>  <i>Now rest, and go further.</i> <br><br>  One of the first psychological defense mechanisms is denial.  Often, the first rush is to ignore the problem.  Act as if this does not exist.  Act as if the event did not happen. <br>  When a person denies the facts, it does not mean that he does not understand or is not convinced.  This means that he is afraid to believe.  Reality conflicts with his worldview, and to maintain peace of mind, he tries to convince himself that everything is going as it should, and everything will be fine. <br>  There is a benefit from denial - a person continues to work at the same pace or even faster.  A person works by the same rules and by the same plan as before the news.  And, sometimes, this strategy works. <br><br><ul><li>  A miracle will happen, the customer will change his mind, someone else will do the unpleasant work, etc. </li></ul><br>  The negative reaction does not necessarily occur in response to an important Event.  This may be a trifle that does not want to admit.  For example, at that moment, when we are late for work, but with anger we repeat to ourselves ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be in time, I‚Äôll be in time‚Äù, when a person pushed someone else‚Äôs laptop, you can hear: ‚ÄúI accidentally touched and he fell,‚Äù ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt do anything, I just pressed the power button "... <br>  To maintain mental balance, a person convinces himself and others that an error has occurred, in fact, everything is completely wrong.  ‚ÄúThis cannot be‚Äù, ‚Äúnonsense‚Äù, ‚Äúthis will never happen to us‚Äù - often such phrases sound precisely in denial.  Usually, at this moment a person does not even want to think about the adverse outcome of events. <br>  To deny it is important to convince oneself, therefore a person sincerely tries to believe that it is. <br>  Denial creates a paradox of thought.  To make the denial effective, a person repeats everything that his interlocutors consider to be true, and then tries to convince them that they are mistaken.  To find evidence of the facts that he wants to refute, a person has to fully concentrate on what he encourages interlocutors not to believe.  You can catch a denier by searching for counterarguments, he searches for them, and when he finds them, even of dubious quality, and grabs them like a drowning man in a straw.  As a result, when denying a person, he thinks more about weak points in the proof and argumentation of the interlocutor than on the proof and realism of his. <br><br><ul><li>  In essence, denial is unwillingness to put up with facts. </li></ul><br><h3>  What is the danger of denial? </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0bf/489/7c2/0bf4897c24876673a6f98bd0f1f52c9e.png"><br>  Denial forces one to run away from a problematic topic, as a result, a person does not prepare for an event, does not prepare a ‚Äúplan B‚Äù and, often, is not ready for a situation. <br>  For example: We work with a team for one customer, the customer offered good working conditions, but since it is located abroad, the payment is complicated.  After the first month, he created an account, said that he was faced with the problem of transferring money to our country.  Then they solved the problem, it took another week, then he said that the money was sent, but we could not receive it.  In general, it turned out that we have been working for three months for free. <br>  Each and every reason why we were not paid, is understandable and explainable.  In the aggregate - raise doubts about the decency of the customer. <br>  It seems to be a logical way out of the situation - we need to minimize our risks and look for another project where money will be paid.  Instead, we continue to pedal the existing one, the topic of money becomes sick for us.  And we fall into the trap of denial: we try not to discuss this issue, agree to believe the promises, and continue to work.  However, anxiety increases with each passing day.  And at some point we will come out of this state, but will not it be too late? <br><br><h3>  Symptoms of Negation </h3><br>  Their essence lies in the fact that a person is actively looking for ways to deceive themselves and their interlocutors. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/614/a67/a82/614a67a82169adb3fe0a130381da8acc.png"><br>  One of the symptoms of denial is memory lapses when the interlocutor cannot remember important events of the recent past.  Or rather, he says that he cannot remember. <br>  The phenomenon of lapses in memory is not just forgetting, it is selective forgetting what causes spiritual discomfort and all the related key points and plans. <br><ul><li>  Did we talk about this? </li><li>  Yes, I need to call John, flew out of my head, and today it's too late, I will call tomorrow ... and tomorrow, too, forgets </li><li>  Chronic delays under cover: ‚ÄúI just remembered that we have a meeting‚Äù can also testify to this protection. </li></ul><br><h4>  Key denial expressions </h4><br>  They signal the importance of the next or previous phrase.  As a rule, this thought is key in denial. <br><ul><li>  honestly </li><li>  no doubt </li><li>  in fact </li><li>  fair </li><li>  frankly speaking </li></ul><br>  There are many similar phrases, and they are individual.  Often they are distinguished by a voice. <br><br><h4>  Modifiers </h4><br>  Modifiers are minor corrections and clarifications that slip into speech and raise doubts.  In this case, the proposal itself is consistent with the idea, but a small clarification may change the essence of the matter.  Especially if you listen to him ... <br><ul><li>  I‚Äôm pretty sure they‚Äôll pay us </li><li>  It will probably work. </li><li>  I rarely make such mistakes. </li><li>  Basically, that's all you had to do. </li><li>  Yes, I almost finished </li></ul><br><h4>  Blocking statements </h4><br>  Denial can lead to a counterattack.  The essence of this attack is to divert attention from the problem.  Instead of problems, competences start to be assessed, the actions and abilities of people are discussed and evaluated: <br><ul><li>  Do you think I have not foreseen such a possibility? </li><li>  Why should I lie to you like that? </li><li>  Could I have done such a stupid thing? </li></ul><br><h4>  Operational denial </h4><br>  No, he is not deceiving directly, he simply chooses words in such a way that there is no problem, or answers a question with a question. <br><ul><li>  - does this feature work well? <br>  - it all depends on what you put in the word "good" </li><li>  - you fixed a bug? <br>  - everything is fine, everything will work </li></ul><br><h4>  Nonverbal signs </h4><br>  One curious non-verbal gesture is connected with denial - it is a shrug by shoulders or shoulder.  Sometimes, he slips unnoticed when a person is in denial, answers the question or says something. <br><br><h3>  What to do if you notice the denial of the interlocutor? </h3><br>  In this situation, there are two working approaches <br><br><h4>  Hard through logic </h4><br>  We suppress the negation using logical arguments and facts.  If the facts are not enough - we will get more information. <br><br><ul><li>  - In principle, we have already done the main thing.  We will surely meet the deadline. <br>  ‚ÄúI see that there are 50 story points left on the tasks, and there are two weeks to Deline.‚Äù  And we have an average performance - 10 story points per week.  Due to what we have time? </li></ul><br>  Quite possibly, we know about what happened only from the words of the narrator.  In this case, ask questions and fill in the blanks in the description.  We place particular emphasis on the facts: what happened then?  What did he answer? .. When the interlocutor makes a hasty conclusion, from our side, the conclusion ‚Äúyes all garbage, everything will be ok‚Äù, agree with him.  Then ask the question about what will happen if the conclusion is not confirmed: ‚Äúprobably and if not, how do we plan?‚Äù, ‚ÄúAnd what is a backup plan?‚Äù, ‚ÄúAnd what are we doing to reinsure the risks?‚Äù <br>  You can use the method of Socratic questions: ask questions about the event and give the person the opportunity to get oneself out of denial.  It is better to direct questions against resistance - that which a person most of all protects, and on which he stubbornly insists.  In this area, it is more likely to find out important details, conclusions, causes and effects. <br><br><ul><li>  You say you should catch the demo tonight.  What else is there left?  Test, document and roll out to production?  How much time does each operation usually take?  Do you think QA will have time to test?  Close up?  Have you ever felt that when you do something in a hurry while making mistakes?  Is there any chance they will be now too?  And what will we do if they are? </li></ul><br>  If the facts are ignored and forgotten, then we patiently recall.  It is usually terribly annoying, angry and pissed off and the person enters the next phase - anger. <br>  Main recommendation: be patient.  It is necessary for a person to recognize a problem, otherwise it is difficult to work effectively on its non-repetition in the future. <br><br><h4>  Mild, respect the desire to hush up the fact </h4><br>  This approach is more humanistic.  It is based on respect for the interlocutor's wishes to hush up the fact.  We agree with him and gently insist on actions that can correct the situation.  Consent ensures the maintenance of contact, actions gradually eliminate the need for psychological protection, since they prevent the negative consequences of denial. <br><br><ul><li>  - Tests fell by myself, I did not commit anything <br>  - Well, they need to be corrected.  So come on now ... </li></ul><br><h3>  What to do if you have noticed Denial in yourself? </h3><br>  It's complicated.  If it turns out - you are good, and you can prepare for the next phases :) Most often, you can expect an aggressive mood, attempts to mentally crack down on the wrongdoers and prove that they are wrong. <br><br><h3>  The Most Important About Denial </h3><br>  Denial is an attempt to ignore the problem.  If it doesn't work, anger begins. <br><br><h2>  Anger </h2><br><h3>  Examples </h3><br>  In IT, the word ‚Äúanger‚Äù is somehow not accepted.  Instead, they usually use ‚Äúirritation‚Äù, ‚Äúanger‚Äù, ‚Äúenrages‚Äù, etc.  Let's see what anger usually results in?  We have already decided not to beat our subordinates, the throwing of the mobile phone also remains in the past decade, but other manifestations are more common: <br><br><ul><li>  raising your voice and aggressive posture </li><li>  threats </li><li>  throw alarm clock far away </li><li>  several times I saw how after a small accident the drivers threw themselves at each other with their fists.  Sometimes there the cars remained completely intact and the situation was already over, but the drivers got into a fight and risked bringing the case to the criminal article. </li></ul><br><h3>  Description </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/656/e18/f05/656e18f05619090b90fe7efad8fc2b8e.png"><br>  <i>Well, get up, stupid animal!</i>  <i>Sprawled here, bad beast!</i> <br><br>  Anger can be a psychological defense.  A person slips into accusations, both substantiated and unfounded.  The main position - to blame others.  But anger is not only an excuse, anger is an attempt to bring the situation under control and to the same course by force. <br>  Anger is more focused on the fight than on the search for a compromise.  If in denial a person does not see the problem, then in anger he sees only power solutions.  Moreover, preference is usually given to the most extreme measures.  Often - with the maximum humiliation of the other side <br><br><ul><li>  -.Who dropped the build? <br>  - this is Vasya ... <br>  - Vasya, what are you doing !? <br>  - Yes, I did not do anything special, just entered a couple of lines, everything was normal there (denial) <br>  - Why then did the build fall?  (fact knocking out of denial) <br>  - And how do I know?  (denial) Architecture curve, because!  (transition from denial to anger) From the very beginning, it was necessary to write normally, and not shout ‚Äúdeadline‚Äù, ‚Äúdeadline‚Äù! </li></ul><br><h3>  What is the danger of being angry? </h3><br>  Anger is a physiological phenomenon, accompanied by the release of very different chemicals in the blood.  This gives +10 strength, +10 response, +10 tolerance to pain, and -50 to the mind.  In the life of an office worker, this is exactly what you need :) <br>  In anger the man <br><ul><li>  does not accept new information </li><li>  become inflexible and aggressive </li><li>  tired quickly, both psychologically and physically.  Not an employee, in general. </li></ul><br><h3>  Symptoms of anger </h3><br>  They are familiar to everyone: Raising voices, clenched jaws, narrowed eyes, aggressive behavior (ignoring personal zones, clenching fists, demonstrating strength, sudden movements, faster and hinting at the attack gait, long and persistent look).  However, these are often obvious symptoms.  A person who is angry can react calmly and calmly.  At the same time he will be given unobtrusive movements and verbal signals of anger. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/077/246/fc1/077246fc12756958af4733d988d9b0ba.png"><br><br><h4>  Attack </h4><br>  A person in a state of anger verbally attacks the interlocutor, insulting, belittling their skills, personal qualities, turning over statements blaming opponents on the principles of ‚Äúfool himself‚Äù, ‚Äúand he first started,‚Äù ‚Äúand he got what he deserved‚Äù, ‚ÄúI have other things or something not". <br><br><h4>  The argument about the little things </h4><br>  A person in a state of anger can begin to argue on small details or trivial issues, diverting attention from the main issue or solving the main problem. <br><br><ul><li>  Manager: John asks to correct this typo on the main page right now <br>  Programmer: Did you create a task in bugtracker? <br>  M: Maybe you will do it yourself?  Or even without her? <br>  P: That is, first you tell that everything must be by the rules, then you hang your work on me.  No, let's do everything as usual </li><li>  Timlid: So, let's use the standards of the HTML language ... <br>  Programmer: HTML is not a language.  C # and JS are language, but HTML is not.  This is a very important difference, and it surprises me that you do not feel it. </li><li>  - We, following the example of Toyota, are trying to use Kanban in our development <br>  - That's it, only Kanban is one of the 14 (!) Principles of Toyota!  Why don't we use them? </li></ul><br><h3>  What to do if noticed anger at the other person? </h3><br>  If, during anger, to point out a person‚Äôs misses, then anger increases, that is, the psychological defense is strengthened.  That is why there are no identical strategies for all defenses.  That which removes denial strengthens anger.  In order to protect the anger gone, it is important to dispel the anger of the interlocutor.  In anger, it is important to keep the person you are talking to;  In practice, this is expressed in a variety of techniques working with anger.  You can use any of them, or in the complex: <br><br><ul><li>  Depreciation.  Difficult to argue with those who do not resist <br><ul><li>  - Who told you such a stupid thought about postponement? <br>  - Thought really is not very good </li></ul><br></li><li>  I am a post.  The word "you" often causes outbursts of anger. <br><ul><li>  Instead of ‚ÄúYou are to blame for the failure of the sprint, I had nothing to give such a task!‚Äù =&gt; ‚ÄúI think that in the future I will avoid such tasks‚Äù </li></ul><br></li><li>  Reframing zoom. <br><ul><li>  We did not refactor, we just optimized a couple of functions. </li></ul><br></li><li>  "You" -passed.  Sincerely, the truth, without a hint of sarcasm. <br><ul><li>  People and their relationships are more important than processes and tools. </li><li>  I am always ready to listen to employees that interest you? </li><li>  On our project - the most important is the people. </li></ul><br></li><li>  Synthones.  Joy on the bad things <br><ul><li>  - How are you boring! <br>  - For QA, tediousness is a positive trait, thanks </li></ul><br></li><li>  Often during anger, a person tries to regain control of the situation.  In this case, it makes sense to give him this control.  Or, at least, the illusion of control. <br><ul><li>  The choice carries a sense of control, therefore - we give a choice.  True or false - depends on the situation: <br><ul><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Do you think Vasya will cope with this task? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Is it easier for you to explain the task to it, or to do it yourself?</font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Will it be more convenient for you to rewrite this tonight or Saturday?

Bargaining is very different from anger and denial. When a person goes into bargaining, he, in fact, recognizes that the situation has taken place, but at the same time the person is looking for ways (non-constructive ways) in order not to encounter the result of the situation. Bargaining should be distinguished from an attempt to agree, in bargaining everything is exaggerated and slightly distorted. In bargaining, many things are brought to the extreme. Often bargaining looks like an attempt to pay off problems. In fact, bargaining is an attempt to disguise reality without denying it. This is a mild form of deception and self-deception. Bargaining may look like an attempt to reach an agreement with higher powers (and unilaterally), may manifest itself as an attempt to reach an agreement with a partner unilaterally (Let me do this, and you accordingly will do what you promised).</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> You can mark the stage of negotiations as an attempt to regain your self-esteem. </font></font><br><br><h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> What is the danger of bargaining?

Stress, as the starting trigger of reactive reactions </font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is difficult to say exactly who first proposed to consider stress a trigger that triggers the stages of the Elizabeth model. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The authors of the article initially peeped at the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãlinking stress and dying stages with </font></font><a href="http://www.stanbwalters.com/about.html"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Wall Volters</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Wall used a rather original stage of dying to determine the sincerity of the suspects. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He, in turn, extrapolated the Kubler-Ross model to track lies using the idea of </font></font><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Ekman"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">P. Ekmen</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">(Telling Lies: Clues to Deceit in the Marketplace, Politics, and Marriage) that lying causes stress. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">According to Volters, stress should trigger a chain of reactive reactions (Volters' term), i.e. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Kubler-Ross model. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Of course, this formulation is not ideal from the point of view of theoretical psychology, but, based on the feedback on the work of Wall Walters, it has shown itself quite well in practice.</font></font><br><br><h3> 3.     </h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The coincidence of the stages with the general adaptation syndrome </font></font><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Selye"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">G. Salier</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> speaks in favor of the K√ºbler-Ross model </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">OAS, according to G. Salye, goes through three stages: </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">alarm reaction - resembles a state of denial (in the Shock phase), and a state of anger (Antishock phase); </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">resistance - at the beginning of the phase, the continuation of the state of anger, after passing the peak, resembles the state of bargaining, if you extrapolate it to human behavior - the body feels exhausted through emotional states (fear, anxiety, etc.) and the mechanism of self-esteem (self-esteem falls) the psyche is encouraged to seek protection, and support from other people. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">exhaustion and recovery - the </font></font><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(biology)"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">third stage</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , in fact, demonstrates a phase of depression and, in part, acceptance (only as part of a recuperation).</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">By itself, the general adaptation syndrome does not relate to the process of accepting and processing new information, and changes to the self-concept that occur in the K√ºbler-Ross model, its task is to help the body cope with the situation at a biological level. But, at the same time, by launching biochemical reactions in a specific sequence, it strongly influences the stages described by Elizabeth. If a person copes with stress, he has the opportunity to get out of the sequence. If a person constantly feels stressful, then he gets the ever-changing stages 1-3 of the Elizabeth model, which then ends with the stage of depression. Depression is usually quite strong, since the adaptive capacity of the body is completely exhausted. Often this is accompanied by psychosomatic diseases.</font></font><br><br><h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 4. Transactional Analysis and the Five-Step Kubler-Ross Model </font></font></h3><script type="text/javascript">function gtElInit() {var lib = new google.translate.TranslateService();lib.translatePage('ru', 'en', function () {});}</script><script type="text/javascript" src="https://translate.google.com/translate_a/element.js?cb=gtElInit&amp;client=wt"></script><br>  To a large extent pushed to monitor the reactive states of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transactional_analysis">Transactional Analysis</a> , which contains a similar system, also tied to stress.  Stan Wollams put forward the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa scale of stress.  The more stress, the greater the likelihood of a person entering the script.  Entering the scenario process, according to Franklin Ernest, a person changes his life position (I + You +, I + You-, I-You +, I-You-) according to the OK Corral model.  This model fits very well on the model of reactive reactions.  For brevity, you can combine two models in the form of a picture: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5fd/22d/dc6/5fd22ddc6ea977d24f3a911683462470.png"><br>  During denial, a person holds the position of I + You +, the negation itself acts as a psychological defense of the existential position.  If the level of stress is high enough, and the negation does not work, then the person goes into the scenario process, changing existential positions depending on the scenario.
