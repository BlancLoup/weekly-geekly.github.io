      According to the study, the global market for corporate SaaS applications will reach $ 8.5 billion by the end of 2010.  Thus, the company's revenue will grow by 14% compared with 2009. <br><br>  At the same time, the competitive environment has three stable trends: <br><ol><li>  The overwhelming number of SaaS solutions for business refers to project management; </li><li>  almost all project management organization services have grown out of their own needs of development companies, the functionality of most services is almost identical; </li><li>  currently there are only a few universal services, only one of them is an active player in the market. </li></ol>  Today, SaaS services do not cause such a stir in the press as social services.  It is believed that there is no innovation in business applications, but this is only stereotypical thinking associated with the traditional view that corporate software is a boring topic.  At the same time, it is obvious that truly innovative and, possibly, significantly stronger innovations that change modern life, are already taking place today in corporate startups. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Google‚Äôs development, the <a href="http://www.asana.com/">ASANA</a> project, developed by one of the creators of Facebook in the company of well-known Internet actors and investors, the emergence of services such as <a href="http://www.staction.com/">Staction</a> and <a href="http://rule.fm/">Rule.fm</a> - all this indicates that the market is ready for change, and serious innovations in the field of productivity and SaaS for business organization is still ahead. <br><br>  Gartner predicts that by 2014, up to 90% of project management systems will be provided as SaaS and predicts significant development of the market for these projects in the coming years due to the growth of new users (the emergence of new business and the transition of companies to ‚ÄúCloud‚Äù), while existing users may redistribute between new services, focusing on low cost. <br><br>  But in the market of content management, communications and interaction of employees, there is a wide variation in SaaS preferences.  So, only 4% of companies use SaaS to work with corporate information, and 82% of companies use online conferences for communication. <br><br>  In the customer relationship management market, the SaaS share forecast is 26% in 2010.  In this case, three companies: <a href="http://salesforce.com/">Salesforce</a> , <a href="http://netsuite.com/">Netsuite</a> and <a href="http://rightnow.com/">RightNow</a> earn more than $ 1.5 billion a year.  The market valuation of Salesforce, one of the oldest companies in the SaaS market, exceeds $ 9 billion, which exceeds the estimated volume of the entire EA-SaaS market. <br><br>  Directly EA-SaaS market can be divided between large profitable (including public) companies - such as the leaders listed above, and young projects, conditionally related to Web2.0.  Companies differ both in size (number of employees) and in pricing, business model, openness, and market strategy. <br><br>  In our study, we mainly consider the so-called Web2.0 EA-SaaS applications, as the most dynamically developing segment.  Due to the fact that there are more than a hundred of such applications, we focused on the most active in terms of marketing and compliance with technological trends. <br><br>  <b>You can get the full text of the research report by writing to us at <a href="">research@startupindex.ru</a> .</b> <br><br>  Write in the letter your surname, name, patronymic, company name, position, reason for interest in the study and, if possible, contact phone number.  Also indicate whether you agree to receive all subsequent <a href="http://startupindex.ru/">StartupIndex</a> research and announcements of the new <a href="http://startupindex.ru/review/">StartupIndex Review</a> journal. <br><br>  We do not publish the report as a whole, because we believe that in such a field as Internet market research, an individual approach to each is needed.  We want to know more about the needs and interests of our audience in order to make the following research even better and more accurate, which is completely impossible without feedback, open communication and support from our readers. <br><br>  More topic SaaS-applications will be covered in the seventh issue of the StartupIndex Review, which will be released before the end of 2010. <br><br>  The full list of research objects includes more than fifty companies and projects: 37 Signals (Ta-daLists, Basecamp, Highrise, Backpac, Writeboard), Asana, BantamNetworks (BantamLive), BatchBlueSoftware (BatchBook), BehanceLLC (ActionMethod), Box.netInc.
