In the spring of 2016, Juno plans to launch in New York.  Representatives of the startup are confident that they will be able to lure many Uber drivers to themselves.  They plan to "restore justice" by offering more favorable financial terms for the partnership, as well as their shares.  Juno will charge drivers a lower commission than Uber. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWhen building its company, Uber completely forgets about the people who, in fact, do the main work, about the drivers.  Imagine a company in which all employees have a bad attitude towards management - you don‚Äôt want to remain in such a company, ‚Äùsays Juno founder Talmon Marco. <br><br>  The announcement of Uber‚Äôs competitor‚Äôs entry into the New York market successfully coincided with a wave of protests by US drivers against changes in the financial terms of cooperation introduced by Uber in January.  Dissatisfied complain that the tariff reduction imposed on them hurts their earnings. <a name="habracut"></a>

      Taxi services use reduced rates and bonuses to attract customers.  However, at the same time, the taxi service loses qualified drivers who go to competitors. <br><br>  Marco promised that Juno would try to avoid price wars, which until now were common in this segment.  "Every time Uber or Lyft reduces prices, this is done at the expense of drivers," explains the head of Juno. <br><br>  According to him, drivers who agree to cooperate only with Juno will be considered as employees of this company, and not as independent contractors. <br><blockquote>  Unlike Uber, which charges a 20% commission, Juno plans to limit to 10%.  In addition, for drivers reserved half of the shares Juno. </blockquote>  Juno tries to improve relations with Uber drivers, demanding that they have a high rating in the Uber system.  Juno pays some Uber drivers $ 25 a week, requiring them to only keep running the Juno app on their regular Uber trips.  According to Marco, this will allow the company to better understand the behavioral patterns of users, features of city traffic and other data necessary for the successful functioning of a startup. <br><blockquote>  Information about the financial status of Juno is not disclosed, Marco says only that the startup has attracted several tens of millions of dollars. <br><br>  <a href="http://stmegi.com/posts/31645/novyy-startap-juno-ot-osnovateley-viber-konkurent-uber/">It is known</a> that at the moment Juno has a development team in Israel and an R &amp; D center in Minsk with more than 40 people.  In addition, the startup rented an office in the center of Manhattan with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãabout 1000 square meters. <br><br>  Juno is a new startup from <a href="https://megamozg.ru/post/23394/">Viber</a> founders Talmon Marco and Igor Magazin. </blockquote><br>  However, the competition in the passenger traffic market in New York is very acute, and one of Uber's rivals, Hailo, has <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/uber/11904335/Hailo-backs-cabbies-in-battle-with-Uber-as-it-ditches-minicab-service.html">admitted</a> defeat. <br><br>  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyft">Lyft</a> , a successful Uber competitor in the US market, attracts drivers with a tip system and lower commission for full-time taxi drivers.  A few days ago, Uber decided to follow the example of a competitor, also introducing preferential commissions for taxi drivers, working full time. <br><br>  On January 22, Megamind <a href="https://megamozg.ru/post/23498/">wrote</a> that one of the largest automakers in the world, General Motors, entered the transportation market a bit from the other side.  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors">GM</a> launched the Maven ride and car sharing service.  In cars, customers will be able to use 4G LTE, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. <br><br>  For the first time, 21 General Motors vehicles of the Chevrolet Volt and Spark brands will operate at Maven.  In order to use the services of Maven, users do not need to issue a paid subscription.  This is a fundamental decision of the creators of the service. <br><br>  Leading automakers are doing everything to speed up the transition to the production of fully self-driving cars, which, according to the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa number of companies, in the near future will be completely excluded from the taxi service market. <br><br>  The gross indicator of its prices in New York, which was $ 26 per hour in 2012, rose to $ 39 per hour in 2015, Vedomosti reports, citing data from Uber.  However, the fees charged by Uber also increased.  But how the net revenue of drivers has changed is not specified. <br><br>  Uber is the most expensive startup in the world - its value is estimated at $ 62.5 billion. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299318/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299318/</a></p>
