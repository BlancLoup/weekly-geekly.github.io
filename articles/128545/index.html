      First, a little about the institution.  This is a small state university (we have a little more than a thousand students), fully focused on computer science training and research.  The university is still relatively young (founded in 1993) and not very famous.  The most interesting feature of a university is its international focus.  Half of the university teachers are foreigners, English is the official language of communication along with Japanese.  Foreign students are not many, but by the standards of Japan decently.  In general, we must bear in mind that Japan is not the States and not the European Union.  There has never been a crossroads of people.  There are still few foreigners and few speak English.  Therefore, the project of our university for Japan is unusual and interesting. <br><br>  In my opinion, the results are not good enough.  I would like to see more students from different countries here, a more diverse and fun communication environment.  Therefore, I write :) Frankly, life is poisoned by two circumstances.  The first is the Japanese love of big names.  A typical applicant says: Tokyo University is great, Waseda is fine, Kyoto is also super.  And Aizu University is the periphery, what good is there?  Therefore, the bulk of our students are those who, for one reason or another, did not get into famous universities.  The second circumstance is connected with the fact that few people go to science, and for most people, the university is only a cheerful respite between a rather hard school and not less hard work in the future.  Therefore, we are always happy sensible guys "from the side" - their, frankly, not enough. <br><br>  However, recently the situation is slowly changing.  Last year we had a competition of about five people per seat, which is not bad for a technical college.  Optimists say that due to the economic crisis, applicants finally began to pay attention to the chances of finding work after graduation, and among our graduates there is a very high percentage of successful hiring.  Pessimists believe that because of the same crisis, many people now simply cannot afford more expensive establishments (education in Japan is paid).  What is the truth - I do not know yet.  Probably fifty fifty. <br><br>  This fall, we are launching a new <a href="http://cseng.u-aizu.ac.jp/">magistracy wiki-site</a> , specifically designed for informal acquaintance of potential students with us, and the staff with each other.  The main site of the university is a business card, it is maintained by the administration, and it is not so easy to make changes there.  Here, each employee will be able to tell about himself what he wants, to advertise their scientific activities.  While the site, of course, pustovat, but I hope to stir up people.  Everyone has problems with free time, of course. <br><br>  Now, regarding the admission of new students.  We welcome all - undergraduates, graduate students, postdocs.  Unfortunately, as I mentioned, education in Japan is paid.  Although we are not very expensive, but the costs are significant.  After all, among other things, it is necessary to live on something.  Fortunately, there are alternatives.  In Japan, there is a scholarship program for foreigners, supported by the Ministry of Education;  There are also a variety of private foundations.  There are corresponding links on our wiki.  In short, the ‚Äúcore‚Äù scholarship program is very good.  The winner of the scholarship is fully exempt from tuition fees, receives a grant for travel and a decent monthly content. <br><br>  Requirements for students are the minimum.  You must have a degree equivalent to a bachelor‚Äôs degree ‚Äî a bachelor‚Äôs degree, or an incomplete five-year plan.  Moreover, according to the internal rules of our university, even the direction of the previous education does not matter - even chemistry, geography.  However, in this case, the scholarship is not a fact that it will be possible to win (there may be more suitable candidates), and it will not be easy to learn.  Still, computer science is not the most trivial thing :) For graduate students, respectively, requires a complete magistracy.  All disputed cases are considered in private. <br><br>  There are two ways to get this scholarship.  First, we have a couple of places every year for people recommended by university professors (that is, you need to get acquainted with the professor and enlist his support).  Secondly, it is possible to go on ‚Äúcommon grounds‚Äù through the Japanese embassy.  There are their pitfalls, but in general, nothing complicated.  And you can have time to try and so, and commercials - university winners are announced before the deadline for submission of documents through the embassy.  By the way, the nearest set of scholars on the recommendation of our university will be at the end of October.  The main thing is to remember that the scholarship program is a lottery, and if you did not succeed the first time, you just need to try again!  Of course, I will be happy to answer any questions.  I will also be happy if you tell friends about us, including foreign ones. <br><br>  Perhaps it would be appropriate to stick in a colorful photo album and paint the advantages of our edges in every way, but I would probably just recommend looking through the website of the magistracy and asking questions in the comments.  I will mention only one important point.  Geographically, we are located in Fukushima Prefecture, whose name now acts on some as a red rag to a bull (now tell me that any ad is good for advertising except an obituary).  There is nothing to be afraid of.  On the territory of the Aizu region, initially there were no problems, except for fuel disruptions.  We are protected by mountains from all sides, and the radiation even at the worst times did not exceed 0.60 ŒºSv / h (however, the ‚Äúalluvial‚Äù radiation travels with dust and water - it happened that there was almost zero on the asphalt, and in the next ditch the arrow jumped).  Now the radiation background is lower than in Moscow.  Even in the city of Koriyama, which is much closer to the NPP, the radiation was asleep and not dangerous. <br><br>  Perhaps nothing to add.  I will not even mention the unforgettable cultural experience, everything is clear :) Always yours, sensei rg_software. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/128545/">https://habr.com/ru/post/128545/</a></p>
