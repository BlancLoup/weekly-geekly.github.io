The Finance Ministry scared us by the imminent demise of virtual purchases abroad and went into the shadows.  All stood waiting, <i>in what size</i> and, most importantly, <i>when</i> will the limits be officially approved and adopted by the customs officers? <br><br>  A fresh forecast: Day D will be July 5, then the amount of the duty-free limit will be officially announced.  However, on the sidelines, customs brokers bet that by the end of 2014.  limits, even if approved, will not take effect ... Rumors are rumored, but one thing is obvious, sooner or later limits will take effect, and then the moneymakers from the <i>Association of Internet Trading Companies</i> will finally begin to cut the loot. <br><br>  But for every tricky ass, as you know ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  While we were entertaining ourselves by <a href="https://www.roi.ru/6536/">voting at the ROI</a> for the abolition of the introduction of the customs limit, people, whose business is directly connected with international postal items, were looking for workarounds.

      Yes, the well-known forwarders (Shopfans, Banderolk, Mainbox, Polar Express) began to work out the options: <br>  - delivery through Kazakhstan, Belarus with internal limits of the customs union were dismissed due to the rise in price of the kilogram of delivery. <br>  - delivery through the European Union, in particular, sending of demand to Finland, was also problematic from a logistical point of view ... <br><br>  And then the first burst <a href="https://vk.com/shopfans%3Fw%3Dwall-28701222_33889">Shopfans</a> .  Today, the company has issued a "press release" in which it announced the following: <i>in one physical package for one addressee there may be goods for whatever number of recipients.</i>  <i>At the same time, the customs limit for each recipient is separate.</i> <br>  Follow the logic: the parcel has an <u>addressee</u> - this is the person who will directly receive the physical parcel.  But now, in addition to the addressee, the parcel also has <u>recipients</u> who carry their belongings in this parcel, but the courier does not need it when delivering the parcel; only one recipient is needed. <br><br>  <b>What does this give us:</b> <br>  If, say, on June 5, a $ 200 limit is introduced per person, then: <br>  1) you can create a package in which there will be 10 Moto E pieces for $ 129 each. <br>  2) At the same time, for each Moto E there will be a customs recipient (1 addressee and 9 recipients, totaling 10). <br>  3) For each recipient, the customs limit does not exceed $ 200, despite the fact that the mail box of goods flies on $ 1290. <br>  4) the cost of delivery of 10 phones is blurred at all, while no one pays a fee <br>  5) profit <br><br>  Now send the parcel to work with at least thirty identical goods within the customs limit is now easier than ever, only copies of your colleagues' passports are needed at the stage of filling out the declaration in your personal account. <br><br>  <b>What you need to provide for this:</b> <br>  Only copies of recipients' passports during the entry of goods into the declaration.  Hell, even when the recipient receives the parcel, only his passport is required, the passport of the ‚Äúrecipients‚Äù going in the parcel with the trailer is not needed. <br><br>  <b>What can not be done in this way:</b> <br>  But to get the goods whose cost exceeds the size of the customs limit (say $ 200), even if you enter all your pedigree - it is impossible. <br><br>  <b>In the dry residue</b> <br>  Elegant method, no doubt.  Moreover, he has already been commissioned by Shopfans and you can send about 30 iPhones in one package and don‚Äôt pay a penny of duty (the limit is 1000 euros so far), having armed with thirty passports of open-sale colleagues. <br><br>  And I don‚Äôt want to jerk, but the gentlemen from AKIT seem to have fought for this, and that‚Äôs what they did.  Now making joint purchases has become, on the contrary, safer, which means that the flow of boxes with Calvin Klein shoes will only grow. <br><br>  PS <br>  By the way, under the hood of this thing is quite a simple solution.  Brokers provide documents to the FCS as if each addressee receives his goods separately, therefore the FCS does not have any understanding in which box, goods were sent together or separately. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/223627/">https://habr.com/ru/post/223627/</a></p>
