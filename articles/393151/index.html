  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Messengers are seriously thinking about the privacy of millions of their users.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A couple of weeks ago, many of you noticed the message from WhatsApp, which was displayed in all your chats.  The following message was displayed next to the lock icon: <br>  Messages that you send to the chat, and calls are now protected through a system of end-to-end encryption.  Click to learn more. <br><br>  One small update of the application caused a heated discussion in the field of IT.  The WhatsApp statement assures 1 billion service users around the world that neither WhatsApp nor any third parties will be able to listen or read information transmitted between users.  This information includes messages, photos, videos, voice messages, documents, and calls. <br><br>  For WhatsApp, the inability to access user data is important.  There are opinions that encryption technology was added after the Apple and FBI proceedings, but I do not think these things are interrelated.  To implement such a large-scale project for end-to-end encryption would take a long time.  Before releasing the update, extensive testing and scheduling is required to make sure that it is working properly. <a name="habracut"></a>

      <b>What impact will a new service feature have on users?</b> <br><br>  Encryption technologies are widely used on the Internet.  If a user makes an online purchase or simply logs onto Google.com, a lock icon and notification of HTTPS support are displayed in the browser, which means that data sent online is encrypted or hidden from intruders.  WhatsApp has given this technology further development.  This is the most popular cross-platform messaging application that works on various devices, so it was a bold decision by the developer.  This end-to-end encryption can be compared with the use of an envelope when sending a letter that no one can read, even a postman. <br>  A message sent via WhatsApp is now encrypted from the moment it leaves the sender‚Äôs device until it is received by the addressee.  No one, including whatsapp, can see the contents of the message, even if it is intercepted during delivery.  Now users can be sure that all their messages and calls are secure.  The service works as before, so users will not even replace that a new function is integrated into the application. <br><br>  <b>Why was there so much talk about this update?</b> <br><br>  The fact that even WhatsApp will not be able to view messages or listen to calls, if the company receives a formal request from law enforcement agencies, means that your data will not be transferred to third parties.  Due to the fact that WhatsApp chose this approach to encryption, it will be very difficult for state and law enforcement agencies to access data that can help during the investigation.  It will also be interesting to see what happens after the decision of the European Court of Human Rights, according to which companies have the right to read the employee‚Äôs private communications if it is assumed that the company‚Äôs policy has been violated.  This will be difficult to do, given that the WhatsApp messages are encrypted. <br><br>  <b>How can the state react</b> <br><br>  There has been a debate over whether government agencies will try to ban the use of such technologies, but it will be very difficult to do.  Prohibiting the use of encryption technology can lead to a big loss for the digital economy.  We need encryption to protect our personal data, but we must also find a compromise on when law enforcement agencies can access this kind of information. <br><br>  At the moment we are in a very interesting situation;  we treat our personal information very easily and place it on the Internet, which attracts the attention of intruders.  On the other hand, we want to be sure that we are not constantly monitored, and we maintain our confidentiality.  If other services, including Viber, Facebook Messenger and Snapchat, follow the same path, then we can witness a revolution in encryption. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/393151/">https://habr.com/ru/post/393151/</a></p>
