My acquaintance with UML began with the State Machine (finite state machine, if approximately in Russian). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Therefore, as a result of a series of ‚Äúgestures‚Äù, I found several UML editors that went through my initial filter (I‚Äôll make a reservation in advance, this list will not be complete, and the review of the IBM Rational family will appear a little later when I can get hold of the gig trial version of the product: )): <br><br>  1. NClass <br>  2. MS Visio Professional 2007. <br>  3. Altova UModel 2008. <br>  4. Magic Draw. <br>  5. Sparx Enterprise Architect. <br>  6. Visual Paradigm. <br>  7. Sybase Power Designer <br>  8. Rational (family). <br><br>  I compared these ‚Äúeditors‚Äù according to the following criteria: <br>  1. UML support.  (Score from 0 to 10) <br>  2. Verifying UML diagrams.  (Score from 0 to 10) <br>  3. Generation of source codes by UML diagram.  (Score from 0 to 10) <br>  4. Reverse engineering of source codes.  (Score from 0 to 10) <br>  5. Supporting development processes (I don‚Äôt understand much, but I need to develop myself).  (Score from 0 to 10) <br>  6. Designing the database.  (Score from 0 to 10) <br>  7. Supported databases, by default.  (For each database by 0 to 5 points) <br>  8. Validate the database. (Score from 0 to 10) <br>  9. Reverse engineering database. (Score from 0 to 10) <br>  10. Ease of use (so I liked it.) (Rated from 0 to 10).

    <h4>  Let's get started </h4><br><h5>  NClass </h5><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6a6/64d/bf0/6a664dbf038a51c02d6aabb76dffa9b8.png"><br><br>  I note right away that this is a completely free editor.  How did he get here?  I liked him :) <br>  I am considering version 1.08.  Judging by the developers at www.nclass.sf.net, version 2.0 should come out soon with significant improvements.  What does he allow us to do from the listed list: <br>  1. Only class diagram. (2). <br>  2. Can not check (0). <br>  3. Generates only C # code, but pretty good (5). <br>  4. Can not (0). <br>  5. Processes do not support (0). <br>  6. Cannot work with DB (0). <br>  7. - (0) <br>  8. - (0). <br>  9. - (0). <br>  10. And I liked it :) (9). <br><br>  Total honestly scored their legitimate, in my opinion, 16 points.  I hope the developers will continue to work on this project and will please us more than one version. <br><br><h4>  Next patient </h4><br><h5>  MS Visio Professional 2007 </h5><br><br>  What is this <s>corpse of a</s> software product ... It is quite difficult to describe everything from the ‚Äúbay-swag‚Äù like this.  Quite a wide functionality, one can say more precisely - a combine.  Only I got the impression that the team responsible for Visio has not done anything since 2003.  I didn‚Äôt see any significant changes in functionality compared to MS Visio 2003 Enterprise Architect, although I‚Äôm lying, I saw no code generation from the UML diagram, at least I couldn‚Äôt find it.  I note right away that judging by the description on MS of MS Visio Enterprise Architect Architect 2007, there is no such thing in nature, and it is a pity I really liked version 2003.  But something my story "led to the side" :). <br>  So Visio can do a lot (draw), the quality is not bad enough <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/47b/6d6/540/47b6d6540bc3371b3472c748b4d1eb20.png"><br>  There is also support for UML, only code generation and validation disappeared somewhere ... <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cd1/a34/05b/cd1a3405b6be3bfd0cab30be663bf6c6.png"><br>  I think an attentive user will notice an error in this figure. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/875/ee4/a4d/875ee4a4d72b49ab70090accb4b977a7.png"><br>  With databases, this product has not forgotten how to work, well, thanks for that. <br><br>  So, what does Visio have in our asset: <br>  1. UML is supported (9). <br>  2. In version 2003 it was, and then somehow quiet. (0). <br>  3. Like the previous item. (0) <br>  4. Alas.  (0). <br>  5. Yes, but as far as accurate and correct, I do not presume to judge (8). <br>  6. Able to design (9). <br>  7. The standard package included drivers for: MS Access, MS SQL Server, Oracle, IBM DB2, ODBC, OLE DB.  In my work I used only 2 - for Orakla and for SQL server, everything is supported in full size, as far as I can tell. (30). <br>  8. The correctness of some kind of "curve" (7). <br>  9. Able to create a model based on an existing database (9). <br>  10. Pretty comfortable, but could be better (7). <br>  Total MS Visio Professional 2007 went the distance for 79 points.  Applause!  <s>Take out</s> . <br><br><h4>  Suddenly from somewhere out of the bedroom with a bododunishka no ... </h4><br><h5>  Altova UModel 2008 </h5><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/261/450/c10/261450c1016e6dc41b8d6a4e1452fe9d.png"><br><br>  Product from a well-known company in certain circles.  Apparently, one of the ‚Äúfirst experiences‚Äù (I do not state with 100% confidence, but this company has not been noticed before).  At first glance, not quite bad, let's try to get to know each other.  UML - yes, he (a) knows what it is and what kind of beast it is.  I used this product a little <s>poke in otkamkatitelny purposes</s> .  What I did not immediately like - the interface, somehow inconvenient everything is located or unusual, as anyone. <br>  So dry statistics: <br>  1. UML, for it was created (10). <br>  2. Can check for correctness (10). <br>  3. Judging by the stated data, it can generate code for Java, C #, Visual Basic, XML Schema (10). <br>  4. Able to reverse and can act as a supplement to VS and Eclipse (10). <br>  5. Business processes (9). <br>  6. Cannot work with DB (0). <br>  7. - (0). <br>  8. - (0). <br>  9. - (0). <br>  10. Convenience is, but you need to get used to it, I prefer to get used to it was not necessary (8). <br>  Final 57 points. <br><br>  This article does not end there, the next one will be written about the remaining worthy representatives, Continued to be continued ... <br><br>  <b>UPD</b> If the HB is interested in learning about similar programs under Linux OS, please unsubscribe in the comments :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/46648/">https://habr.com/ru/post/46648/</a></p>
