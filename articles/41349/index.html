  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Will Yammer become a corporate Twitter?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <a href="http://yammer.com/">Yammer</a> , as far as the public knows, got the ‚Äú <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/09/10/yammer-takes-techcrunch50s-top-prize/">best product</a> ‚Äù on TechCrunch50.  The blogosphere has a rather negative <a href="http://www.techmeme.com/080911/p77">opinion</a> on this.  I read some of the feedback from different users and made a table showing the author and the reason he didn‚Äôt like Yammer: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3cb/a30/842/3cba308424a20c744735ac41e4b17a68.gif" alt="image1"><br><br>  The reaction I was a little surprised, despite the fact that positive feedback was also present.  Let's look at each of the reasons separately. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Another Twitter clone </h2><br>  Understandable reaction.  We saw <a href="http://plurk.com/">Plurk</a> , <a href="http://identi.ca/">Identi.ca</a> , <a href="http://rejaw.com/">Rejaw</a> and others.  Therefore, when a new microblogging service appears, people immediately say ‚Äúanother Twitter clone‚Äù 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      The key difference is the goals.  Yammer is not a product for users, but for enterprises. <br><ul><li>  To succeed at Identi.ca, people need to stop using Twitter ( <a href="http://www.louisgray.com/live/2008/09/as-twitter-regains-footing-competitors.html">an article on this topic</a> ) </li><li>  For success, Yammer Twitter is useful, as the more people use Twitter, the more they understand the price of microblogging and, if necessary, begin to use Yammer. </li></ul><br><h2>  Twitter / someone else will do the same </h2><br>  If you recall the difficulties that Twitter has to overcome daily, just to not fall apart, I would be very surprised if they have more time to try to enter the corporate market. <br><br>  Businesses and users are two completely different markets.  <a href="http://mikeg.typepad.com/perceptions/2008/09/microblogging-i.html">Mike Gotta</a> spoke well on this topic: <br><blockquote>  Within the enterprise, it is highly likely that IT organizations classify these tools as IM platforms.  And as platforms for IM, they must maintain a certain level of protection, archive functions, etc., in order to appear acceptable in the eyes of senior managers. </blockquote><br>  To achieve success in the enterprise, you need to fully concentrate on the enterprises.  Twitter should concentrate on the user market. <br><br><h2>  Model of knocking out money </h2><br>  Officially, Yammer is a free system.  However, if a company wants to control its ‚Äúsegment‚Äù, access to the admin panel is paid. <br><br>  I admit that this is quite an interesting idea.  It not only demonizes developers, but also answers immediately two eternal questions: <br><ul><li>  How can I get someone to try my programs? </li><li>  How can I prove that it has a price. </li></ul><br>  Companies rarely pay for a product if they don‚Äôt see that employees use it and that it is paying off.  This is a rather tricky and at the same time reasonable way to offer your product to an enterprise.  <a href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/">Atlassian Confluence</a> received its share of the wiki market through viral adaptation. <br><br><h2>  Users will not be able to get used </h2><br>  This is where Yammer meets his most challenging task, namely, getting people to do microblogging.  Twitter is available to hundreds of millions of users, but only a small percentage of these people actually use it. <br><br>  Inside the enterprise you need a much higher level of adaptation.  People who are already using Twitter will figure out pretty quickly, but most will ask, ‚ÄúWhy do I need this?‚Äù. <br><br>  Here you need to remember one detail.  In Yammer, you have a built-in context and users right from the start.  The context is work and work projects, meaning that you will be much more concerned about the message on Yammer than on Twitter. <br><br>  The second is that the executives will also be sitting on Yammer, and then such a thing comes in that you can miss messages from a friend of yours, but it‚Äôs much more dangerous to miss the message from the boss. <br>  Storing work information on other servers is dangerous. <br>  This is a recurring question that has become even more relevant since the recent crashes of Amazon S3 and Gmail. <br><br>  People will discuss important issues, not only that they are going to eat for lunch, so no one argues about the need for a serious approach to the stability and security of the service. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.enterpriseirregulars.com/EI/32915">Anshu Sharma</a> says: <br><blockquote>  Nobody (at least, not me) declares that stationary programs will disappear.  The fact is that the industry of remote software is growing, and stationary is not particularly.  Venture capitalists like Emergence Capital and Humbold Winblad vote in dollars! </blockquote><br><h2>  Gartner's cool cycle </h2><br>  Gartner is posting an update of something that he calls the ‚Äúnewness coolness cycle‚Äù.  He explores various technologies that pass through predictable stages. <br><ul><li>  Technological opportunity </li><li>  The peak of unfulfilled expectations </li><li>  Dispelling illusions and myths </li><li>  Slope enlightenment </li><li>  Productivity plateau </li></ul><br>  In July 2008, Gartner released his latest analysis.  There is both microblogging and ‚Äúcloud computing (remote software)‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c6f/350/c87/c6f350c87f501a0fd7cf132e67e4a81f.gif" alt="image2"><br><br>  Judging by the figure, microblogging and cloud computing will become popular only in 5-10 years.  It takes time to get to the plateau of productivity.  But I will be watching Yammer. <br><br>  <b>Translation: Vladimir Shilov, <a href="http://toodoo.ru/">toodoo</a> is a social network of website users, especially for Habrahabr</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/41349/">https://habr.com/ru/post/41349/</a></p>
