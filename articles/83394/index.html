I really liked this type of mystery, but new ones were very rare.  And then I stumbled upon the wonderful book by Paul Sloan: ‚ÄúPuzzles with a secret to the development of non-standard thinking‚Äù (Tricky Lateral Thinking Puzzles) <a href="http://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/3374768/">on Ozone</a> .  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateral_thinking_puzzle">Situation puzzles</a> or just <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2594%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0">danyki</a> (‚Äúyes / no‚Äù puzzles), these puzzles are well solved collectively. <br><br>  I suggest you guess one of these puzzles! <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Rules: the presenter describes a strange story, and the guesser must restore the whole situation.  The presenter can only answer ‚ÄúYes‚Äù, ‚ÄúNo‚Äù or ‚ÄúInsignificantly‚Äù, which means that the questions should be relevant.
