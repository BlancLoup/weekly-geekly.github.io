He is loved, hated or just used.  The project is very successful: since 2001 it has been making a profit and is considered the largest player in the domain name registration and hosting market.  The only founder is Bob Parsons.  I really liked his rules for work and life, so I initiated their <a href="http://translated.by/you/bob-parsonstm-16-rules-for-success-in-business-life-in-general/">translation</a> . </blockquote><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>1. Get out of your comfort zone and stay away from her.</b> <br><br>  When we are in our comfort zone, nothing happens that would matter.  People often say: "Stability is important to me."  My answer to this is simple: "Stability for the dead." <br><br>  <b>2. Never give up.</b>

      From the first attempt almost never succeeds.  If what you are doing does not work, it does not mean that it will continue this way.  It just means that you have chosen the wrong approach.  If it were simple, absolutely everyone would do it, and you wouldn‚Äôt have a chance to excel. <br><br>  <b>3. If you are ready to give up, then you are much closer to success than you expect.</b> <b><br></b> <br>  There is an old Chinese saying that I adore.  Here it is: "The temptation to surrender will be especially strong shortly before victory." <br><br>  <b>4. As for all those things that bother you: accept the worst that can happen in advance, and try to understand in detail exactly how this worst can look.</b> <br><br>  The ‚Äúworst‚Äù consequences are hardly worse than the effects of the ‚Äúuncertain‚Äù.  When I tried to run Parsons Technology, my father often said to me: ‚ÄúRobert, if you don‚Äôt succeed, no one will eat you for that.‚Äù <br><br>  <b>5. Concentrate on your desires.</b> <br><br>  Remember this old saying: "Thoughts are material." <br><br>  <b>6. Take on just as much work as you can do in one day.</b> <br><br>  No matter how complicated the situation is, you can still get out of it if you don‚Äôt try to look too far into the future and turn to the present.  Any problem can be solved if you deal with it exactly to the extent that you can handle in a day. <br><br>  <b>7. Always move forward.</b> <br><br>  Never stop growing.  Never stop cultivating.  Never stop doing something new.  The moment you stop trying to do your job better, it starts to die.  Set a goal to become better every day, even if in something small.  Be guided by the Japanese concept of kaizen: small daily improvements as a result lead to great success. <br><br>  <b>8. Make decisions quickly.</b> <br><br>  Remember the words of General George Patton: "A lightning-fast plan today is a thousand times better than a perfect plan for tomorrow." <br><br>  <b>9. Measure everything that is meaningful to you.</b> <br><br>  I swear it works.  Everything that is constantly taken into account, measured and observed becomes better. <br><br>  <b>10. Anything left unattended is destroyed.</b> <br><br>  If you want to find problems unknown to you, take a closer look at things that you haven‚Äôt paid attention to for a long time.  I guarantee you that there will be problems. <br><br>  <b>11. Watch your competitors, but watch your own business even more carefully.</b> <br><br>  When you study your competitors, remember that everything looks perfect from afar.  Even planet Earth, if it is far enough away from it, looks like a peaceful place. <br><br>  <b>12. Never let anyone intimidate anyone.</b> <br><br>  In our legal society, under conditions of equality, you have as many rights to do your own business as all the others - provided, of course, that your business is not against the law. <br><br>  <b>13. Do not expect justice from life.</b> <br><br>  Life is not fair.  There will be indulgence only if you arrange them for yourself.  You will reach the goal only when you stop thinking about justice. <br><br>  <b>14. Solve your own problems.</b> <br><br>  As soon as you can find the answers to your questions, you will become competitive.  Masura Ibuka, one of the founders of Sony, formulated this rule in the best way: "You will never succeed in science, business or anything else if you follow the others."  There is also an old Eastern proverb, which I often recall about this.  Here it is: "A wise man is his own adviser." <br><br>  <b>15. Do not judge yourself too harshly.</b> <br><br>  Relax.  Quite often (at least in half of the cases) we owe our success to pure luck.  None of us controls our life to the extent that it seems to us. <br><br>  <b>16. There is always a reason to smile.</b> <br><br>  Find this occasion.  In the end, you're already lucky, since you are alive.  Life is short.  I agree more and more with my younger brother.  He always reminds me: ‚ÄúIt is important to live life not long, but fun.‚Äù <br><br>  <a href="http://slon.pp.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/16rules.odt">Download A4 poster (Open Office) - 16rules.odt</a> <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/42150/">https://habr.com/ru/post/42150/</a></p>
