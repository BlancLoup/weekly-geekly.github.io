Not just a dialer, but with an autodial function</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="http://startpixelrocket.com/promo/promo_image.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe application arose a long time ago, or rather, it‚Äôs better to say that I‚Äôve been looking for a long time, but I haven‚Äôt found anything like this in the AppStore.  Since I am a designer for the job profile, and have never come across coding before, I stayed in the ‚Äúwaiting‚Äù rows for a very long time, when others will come up with it. <br><br>  So, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe application was as follows: a person marks a place on the map where he is going to go, and when approaching this place, the iPhone automatically dials a predetermined number.  No need to be distracted from driving, getting the phone out of your pocket, and looking for the contact in the phone book.

      The dream of such an application was.  But for its implementation it was required either to find a programmer under iOs, or learn how to write the code yourself.  Honestly, I have long wanted to try myself in this field.  In general, I chose the second, and I want to share with you a little story of writing an application from scratch <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I will say right away, I have never written code before, and had nothing to do with a language like C ++.  The first time I read the book ‚ÄúBecome an X-coder‚Äù, I tried to understand the essence of language and syntax.  For me it seemed not very difficult with simple examples, and I wrote my first calculator from the book.  For some reason it seems to me that the stories of many programmers begin precisely with this invention of mankind, translated into computer language. <br><br>  The second time was the goal, namely to make this program and put it in the AppStore, and I proceeded to the second reading of the above book.  I always thought that if there was an idea for a specific application, it would be easier to learn the language with a specific example, and it turned out. <br><br>  Of course, I was disappointed by a small number of sources of material on Objective-C, and I had to collect all the basics and techniques bit by bit from all sorts of blogs (both ours and foreign), reading documentation on <a href="http://developer.apple.com/">Apple‚Äôs</a> website (which the translator helped me), in general I had to do everything most, because there was not much to ask.  The <a href="http://prog.tumblr.com/les022">article by Kiselev Artyom</a> , for which he thanks a <a href="http://prog.tumblr.com/les022">lot</a> , helped me to understand the basics.  The <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stackoverflow</a> site also helped with frequent questions, where, although in English, there were answers, even to the most stupid questions.  As a result, each development step, each button with an action, was for me a holiday. <br><br>  At least in terms of design there were no problems.  I know that most people are faced with this problem, but I was lucky to develop the design without any help. <br><br>  Not to say that my first application was very complex in functionality.  Professionals in this business would have made it much faster than me, but for me it was a small achievement. <br><br>  <i>PS Do not scold me.</i>  <i>When shifting to the AppStore, the start splash disappeared, and now instead of it is a white screen.</i>  <i>I fixed the problem and already sent an update to Apple.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>So very soon everything will be good.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/74cc77f3/477f8ec4/ad47be4e/d9399023.png"><br><br>  <b>Total.</b>  My first application turned out pretty simple, but at the same time functional: <br><br>  - Firstly, this is the auto call function I dreamed of for a long time.  Now when I go home I mark a place on the map, put the girl‚Äôs number, that's all.  Over 100-300 meters to the house, the phone automatically dials the number, and I can tell her to go out. <br><br>  - Secondly, I got a beautiful one-touch dialer, for fans of this genre.  Tapul on the icon, and after a second favorite number is dialed. <br><br>  - And finally, thirdly, I received experience, and I will be happy if the application is popular in the AppStore, because as popular for me, it has become from the first day of development <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/26c9f460/30f2de18/dbd3f1fe/9d035f62.png"><br><br>  <b>Application</b> : myFavorite <br>  <b>Version:</b> 1.0 <br>  <b>Price:</b> $ 0.99 [ <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/myfavorite/id463335632%3Fl%3Dru%26ls%3D1%26mt%3D8">iTunes link</a> ] </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/132057/">https://habr.com/ru/post/132057/</a></p>
