  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Free programs to fill out a tax return</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Less than two months left until the end of the 2008 declaration campaign.  This time is enough to prepare and submit a declaration in working order without unnecessary hassle, usually accompanying queuing in the last days of filing documents. <br><br>  Of course, the difficulty of filling in the declaration forms can be circumvented by using a special software designed to reduce the time spent by the taxpayer to prepare the declaration.  What can the taxpayer expect in this plan this year?  Let's look at a couple of options. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  As usual, the programmers of the GNIVTS FTS came to help the taxpayer, having released a program, like last year, that greatly simplifies the preparation of the declaration. <br>  Compared to last year, the program has undergone a number of changes, some of which are related to changes in the new 3-NDFL form and the procedure for filling it out.  In addition, there have been changes in a number of technical parameters that may affect individual users.  For example, the program will not be able to use the happy owners of new laptops running a new operating system from Microsoft.  The fact is that the Declaration 2007 program uses software components that are missing from the Vista operating system.  Therefore, it is recommended to use the program for users of the Windows XP operating system or earlier versions. <br>  But the new version of the ‚ÄúDeclaration of 2007‚Äù is able to generate two-dimensional bar codes, greatly facilitating the work of entering data into computers by tax inspectors. <br>  Unfortunately, the possibility of exporting the prepared declaration to Microsoft Office file formats was removed from the new version, which made it impossible to subsequently edit the declaration obtained using the program.  Perhaps this is not so scary, and all that the taxpayer needs is able to make a declaration using the regular features of the program. <br>  Of course, the program allows you to create a file for the transfer of the declaration to the tax inspectorate in electronic form. <br>  We were pleased with some improvements, showing that taking care of user convenience for GNIVC programmers is not an empty sound.  For example, the tedious work of driving data from 2-NDFL income certificates is facilitated.  The user has the opportunity to simply duplicate the previously entered record of income for the month by pressing the user interface button specially provided for this. <br><br>  This year, the taxpayer, who has not previously been spoiled by the attention and care, will also be able to use an alternative method of automating the preparation of the declaration, which is provided free of charge, apparently for promotional purposes by the Pineapple Company on its website. <br>  In contrast to all the programmers of the GNIVTS, which have already become accustomed, the ‚ÄúPineapple Company‚Äù offers taxpayers to fill in simple forms directly on its website and receive a file with a ready-made declaration for downloading from the website. <br>  This method is interesting because it does not require the hassle of downloading and installing the program.  The taxpayer does not need anything other than a browser that is used to browse the Internet. <br>  At first glance, the web application from the Company Pineapple looks simple and beautiful.  When studying it in more detail, it turns out that its capabilities are somewhat limited compared to the GNIVTS program. <br>  For example, the application helps in the formation of the declaration only to individuals and entrepreneurs.  But it does not allow a taxpayer who is a lawyer, a private notary or a citizen of a foreign state to form a declaration. <br>  The main advantage of the web application from the Company Pineapple, perhaps, can be called its simplicity and accessibility for the unprepared user.  Successful placement of tips and reference data, such as refinancing rates of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, operating in 2007, can also be credited as a plus to this web application.

      Thus, for a taxpayer with experience, we can recommend his usual instrument from the GNIVTS.  And for those who rarely fill out declarations, has a small number of sources of income and grounds for deductions, it is worth looking in the direction of the Pineapple Company offer. <br><br>  Links to programs: <br>  Program GNIVTS FTS <br>  <a href="http://www.nalog.ru/document.php%3Fid%3D26293%26topic%3Dprog_fiz">www.nalog.ru/document.php?id=26293&amp;topic=prog_fiz</a> <br><br>  Pineapple Company Web Application <br>  <a href="http://ndfl2007.ru/">ndfl2007.ru</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/21370/">https://habr.com/ru/post/21370/</a></p>
