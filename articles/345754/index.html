It is important to tell her to understand who we are and what we do.  Since 2014, we have owned a small catering business in Moscow.  We are engaged in the production of modern confectionery.  In May 2017, the first offline facility opened in the format of a cafe with an open production workshop and the prefix "experimental facility". <br><br>  Old-timers Habra already at this moment can wrap up this article with a comment - a cafe and IT.  Guys, what have you forgotten here?  But, looking ahead, I want to say that today we are developing an IT tool - a BI &amp; Blockchain solution based on collective intelligence.  And it is on this tool I want to focus the attention of the reader in this and subsequent articles.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gj/7q/zw/gj7qzwozlhxyril5r-7uzlt11ti.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  Bitcoin </h2><br>  My acquaintance with cryptocurrency began in 2014.  At that time, my friend and I began to study the crypt and, of course, the acquaintance began with Bitcoin.  This acquaintance led us to the concept of mining.  At that time, it was a pity to spend money on buying Bitcoin, because none of us understood why the course of this virtual dummy should grow, and we earn.  My friend worked as a system administrator in a large shopping center in Moscow.  His position gave us the opportunity to use the infrastructure of this shopping center.  However, from the infrastructure we, in view of our boundless ‚Äúarrogance‚Äù, were able to use only free electricity and high-speed Internet.  So the idea was born to build your own mining farm and feed it with free resources. <br><br>  Attentive reader will ask - <i>you were sorry for $ 100 to buy Bitcoin, but you did not regret $ 1500 to buy a server?</i>  Exactly.  The explanation is simple - real things have real value and this server could be quickly and easily sold, if you were lucky - without losing value. <br><br>  It so happened that the moment of purchase of the first 2x video cards coincided with a sharp rise in the rate of Bitcoin and, as a result, the growth in demand for video cards.  During the week we paid for our server by selling video cards.  And when the demand died down, they started the server on cheaper cards (because there were simply no top ones in Moscow) and changed the plan to mine the lightcoin. <br><br>  For 1.5 years of work 20 lightcoins were mined.  At the rate of that time it is about $ 400.  Simple mathematical calculations showed a <b>fat minus</b> .  As it turned out, we managed to earn money by selling spades during the gold rush. <br><br><h2>  Bitcoin  Part 2 </h2><br>  Our lightcoins, as well as the server, were sold later.  And with the money, they bought 2 Bitcoins at the rate of $ 700.  After some time, they sold having lost $ 100 from the sale of 1BTC ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rz/re/sh/rzreshrmwbbqq_vvxjqumcr-bkc.png" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  Tangible, real and exciting.  The role of IT for small businesses </h2><br>  The history of Bitcoin made it clear that it is much easier and smarter to earn and control what has real weight, understandable demand and reasonable cost. <br><br>  The business we have been doing for the third year was born from the dream of Vera Osinina.  Dreams to open a small and cozy pastry shop.  Today, the dream of opening a cafe has grown into the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating an international confectionery chain with the highest quality products, fair pricing, high level of service and a unique management tool based on collective intelligence. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fn/sv/y6/fnsvy6mttra9rastu7ega6jirng.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  It so happened that a person from the IT world joined Vera (get acquainted - the author of the article who sold Bitcoin in 2016).  He had the opportunity to look at the production and business processes of a very complex, in its essence, business in the sphere of public catering.  A lot of small processes, low degree of control, low degree of automation and the huge role of the human factor.  We have seen tremendous opportunities for optimizing and increasing the efficiency of all internal processes.  So our first cafe turned into a testing ground for testing our ideas. <br><br>  <b>Strategic goals</b> allowed to keep focus and not get bogged down in a routine.  The race for payback periods and profits simply did not give us a future. <br><br>  Taking the first steps in the management and development of cafes, we had a lot of problems associated with a shortage of qualified personnel, automation of inventory control, poor staff learning, imperfect professional equipment.  Everything that is used in work, including IT tools, products, services, etc., has been done for many, and not specifically for us.  As a result, the effectiveness of a seemingly very profitable business line is lost.  We decided to pay more attention to the independent development of managerial, technical solutions, internal regulations, development of the technology for preparing products, the formation of a knowledge base, taking into account our vision of production and business processes. <br><br>  <b>We learn to work efficiently and not to repeat mistakes.</b> <br><br><blockquote>  We love to play chess - this is an interesting, challenging, multifaceted game.  She trains the brain.  Playing "shaking" or throwing a coin - also has a place to be, but rather as a hobby.  For the soul. </blockquote><br><h2>  Blockchain </h2><br>  Before the opening of the first offline venue, one more person joined us.  The first investor.  Mathematician, economist.  A person with experience in leading companies to IPO.  Which eventually turned into an effectively working remote manager.  Using third-party IT solutions (automated warehouse, online cash registers, CRM systems), we every day ran into restrictions in a particular solution.  At the same time, third-party solutions <b>have become the basis of a new business model</b> in which all financial and production processes are transparent, and managers and investors become a team. <br><br>  A few words from Ivan - our first investor. <br><br><blockquote>  <i>Initially, I did not plan to participate in development, but it turned out otherwise.</i>  <i>Without going into details - I was created by the presence effect, in addition to controlling all finances I am in working groups, I have access to cameras, I can communicate with the staff directly in the production process, evaluate how the customer was served and much more.</i>  <i>For me it became a kind of show, a business quest in reality.</i>  <i>It captures, gives the drive and causes the desire to change the usual things.</i> </blockquote><br>  June 2017.  About the blockchain say everything and everywhere.  There are more and more companies that conduct ICOs for real business.  The pioneer is considered to be Mikhail Shlyapnikov and Kolionovo.  The ability to create your own virtual money backed by real production is in the air.  And the principles of transparency and ‚Äútrust‚Äù of the blockchain technology fit perfectly into our new business model. <br><br>  Studying the principles of the blockchain technology, the process and the goals of the ICO, we felt like the guys who came from the village and got off at the station of Kazan Station.  Today, we smile at those who equate the blockchain to cryptocurrencies and consider this technology only in the context of Fintech solutions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/to/uo/2k/touo2k6ng0qha7x7lll1biqd9ae.png" alt="image"><br><br>  So what is a blockchain for us?  This is primarily a distributed database.  We plan to use the blockchain to record all key business performance indicators: accounting, cashier‚Äôs checks, management decisions and current strategic plans.  But to make business transparent, after all, the blockchain is not needed?  It is enough to automate the collection of information and provide access to it ... <br><br>  <b>The blockchain is needed because it is a database in which changes are impossible, it is impossible to forge anything in it.</b>  <b>This is a guarantee of transparency.</b> <br><br><h2>  Ico </h2><br>  By August 2017, realizing the need to develop a tool that in the future will become the basis for our business, we came to the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãholding an ICO.  Thus was born the project, during the preparation of which, we again went along a path contrary to all conceivable "traditions", the essence of which: <br><br><ul><li>  holding an ICO for the sake of ICO. </li><li>  artificially veiled release of a token for an idea, and as a result - a banal fundraising. </li></ul><br>  Thinking over our project, we set ourselves a number of tasks: <br><br><ol><li>  To involve in the project and in the business of people who share our ideas and approach in the conduct of business. </li><li>  Create an opportunity for token holders to participate in the distribution of profits from existing and developing businesses. </li><li>  To enable token holders to participate in business development. </li><li>  Open to the holders of tokens all internal business processes, financial performance and strategic decisions of managers. </li><li>  Provide an opportunity to influence management decisions based on our own analysis of key business indicators. </li><li>  To enable token holders to ‚Äúsell‚Äù expert services that will be useful to the business. </li></ol><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/4k/sr/j9/4ksrj9agchk-kjpmdhlel0xwcks.png" alt="image"><br><br>  We are convinced that by combining financial and intellectual capabilities, we will build a modern, highly profitable business and utterly surpass our competitors. <br><br>  All these thoughts led us to the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating an IT solution - SIMT ( <b>Smart Investment Management Tool</b> ).  I will tell about it in more detail.  But, a little later. <br><br>  We started our journey to ICO from the bitcointalk branch.  In a very authentic form.  We came to the forum as newcomers with a new registered account.  Created a project branch in a simple form without images, colorful headlines, etc.  (although we have something to show).  It was a dry text describing the project and the idea. <br><br>  We did not hide the fact that we are new to the world of cryptocommunity.  They did not hide the fact that they came to the forum in order to convey our thoughts, hear comments, questions, and sarcasm.  The community gave us the opportunity to structure our thoughts.  This is how white paper was born, the basis of which was a rather detailed history of our business, a plan for several years ahead and a carefully calculated token economy. <br><br>  In the process of working on WP, an economic model of the project was born, the analysis of which will allow us to evaluate our plans. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bk/7j/jg/bk7jjgce8m0snep0opkuewglspm.png" alt="image"><br><br>  From October to December, we actively communicated on the forum.  Ideas and thoughts acquired a clear structure, we received valuable knowledge.  The principle of openness gave its results.  The project acquired a finished look and received due design.  The colossal work was done by 2 people, in parallel with the operating activities of the cafe and business.  These were difficult and interesting times.  Every comment as a challenge.  Criticism - as an opportunity to think and analyze their own actions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ix/_y/dj/ix_ydjgusbodc6mxpwhdss3-cno.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  Like-minded people appeared in the team.  Ilya with experience in developing smart contracts, a lawyer, distinguished advisors, media representatives, translators, people interested in our project in Germany and Switzerland.  And, of course, a huge number of freeloaders and people who wanted to earn fabulous sums on various services for ICO. <br><br>  I will definitely mention the description of services for ICO from ambisafe or icos, as well as single ‚Äúexperts‚Äù in a separate article.  Communication with representatives of various companies offering services for ICO, as well as newly-minted experts, has formed a clear understanding of what ICO is today, and why the majority of ICOs are hyip or scam. <br><br>  <b>People themselves create scam by their stupidity and laziness, unwillingness to study the details of investment projects.</b> <br><br>  We found answers to such questions as: <br><br><ul><li>  why the token becomes cheaper immediately after entering the stock exchange </li><li>  why most ICO team plans seem unrealizable </li><li>  why most of the ICO for the real sector is a trivial fundraising </li><li>  Why grow bananas, build plants, or brew a beer with the blockchain? </li><li>  why representatives of the project team can not answer simple questions, and the questions themselves are perceived as unreasonable criticism </li><li>  why ICO approaches are standard </li></ul><br>  We initially went a difficult and non-standard way in the preparation of ICO.  What we only cost the decision to cancel the bounty.  A flurry of emotions and one of the most discussed topics of the day on the forum.  People did not understand us, did not understand how we could violate established traditions, go against the community.  They called us fools. <br><br>  But all our decisions were clear, reasonable and reasoned.  What can we say about our financial goals (over which many ICO projects laugh and laugh): $ 25k in presale with maximum bonuses, $ 150k and $ 750k soft and hard cap, respectively, without any bonuses.  After giving out bonuses, the price of the future token suffers first of all. <br><br><h2>  SIMT Development </h2><br>  Above you may have noticed this strange abbreviation.  <b>SIMT - Smart Investment Management Tool.</b>  Integration of IT solutions in a working business.  Testing and development of an applied tool that will increase the efficiency of the business in the field of catering, so much deprived of attention to IT technologies. <br><br>  A schematic diagram of the operation of SIMT is depicted in this diagram. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hv/zh/0_/hvzh0_nw5wawtmjdfofgyyw0-lq.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Before embarking on an expensive management tool development, we want to make a draft.  Our primary task is to inexpensively and quickly realize the effect of presence.  There was a supply - it is clear, the sale - it is clear, it was stolen - it is clear that the staff did not go to work - everyone knows about it.  Next, we will create a simple voting tool with the ability to offer your own solution to the problem. <br><br>  Today, many projects are doing this: a cool idea has arisen, an innovative prefix is ‚Äã‚Äãquite applicable to it.  On the development of money you need a myriad of.  They attracted investments, created a product, and often it is not needed by anyone.  Our team for a logical and consistent investment. <br><br>  After the presentation of the SIMT community, we are faced with an absolute lack of understanding of the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthis tool and the possibilities that this tool gives us.  That is why you are reading this article on Habr√©.  We have come to a respected community of people and your opinion, criticism, your questions will help us to explain the principles of this solution and the key concept of SIMT. <br><br>  The functionality of the future tool: <br><br><ul><li>  All information about future network operations (cloud offices, operating expenses, raw materials, bank fees, payroll, taxes and fees, rent, utility bills, advertising expenses, etc.) is available for analysis in SIMT and is recorded daily in the decentralized registry. </li><li>  Access to SIMT will be granted to tokens holders. </li><li>  The strategic plan for the development of a highly detailed network is presented in SIMT. </li><li>  Investors (tokens holders) have the opportunity to evaluate each item of the Strategic Development Plan, make their own alternative offer / addition, and lobby for proposals from other SIMT users by voting. </li><li>  Subject to the support of many users, the offer / addition of investors (holders of tokens) will be delivered to the CEO and company management for consideration. </li><li>  The number of tokens does not affect the power of the voice.  One token holder (any number of tokens) = 1 vote.  The value of the idea is determined by the <b>majority of votes</b> , and not by a majority of tokens </li></ul><br>  We believe that making a decision with risk for equity is a guarantee of a responsible, thoughtful decision.  A set of assessments of points of the Strategic Network Development Plan form a comprehensive assessment of the activities of the CEO and the company's management every reporting period (month).  This is the internal approval index for company management. <br><br>  At the moment, a concept has been formed and a simple prototype is being developed.  The integration of blockchain technology is planned for the following stages.  The development is carried out in-house and is being tested at the range created by us - a working offline establishment, our first cafe.  <b>In our own UAT environment.</b>  This makes it possible to monitor the business in real time, analyze indicators and respond instantly, making and implementing informed decisions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ii/vg/ia/iivgianamlroj2h9cchmnfg4eem.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br><blockquote>  The created IT tool is a ‚Äúconcilier‚Äù in business with the possibilities of a collective mind, the diffusion of investors in the Project.  With this tool, the unit has the right to vote and the opportunity to be heard by the majority. </blockquote><br><br><h2>  People sharing our ideas, values ‚Äã‚Äãand approach </h2><br>  In my article you will see a lot of words about ICO, investments, tokens.  Most of the people to whom we begin to talk about our project, about our business and about our dreams meet us, as they say "by clothes".  But the conversation goes into another direction, when we interrupt and speak - listen, we did not come to you in order to ask you for money or invite you to become our investor.  We came to you to tell you our ideas, share experiences, interesting events and stories for us.  Present the project to hear your opinion.  <b>The opinions of people, criticism, questions - this is what gives us the strength to develop, grow and build new plans.</b> <br><br>  The collective image of a person who is interested in our project is an intellectual, an adventurer in something, a rationalist in something.  In addition to knowing vertices of cryptonomy, he has an understanding of political processes related to cryptothematics.  This person will not round his eyes in surprise when he finds out that Ilona Mask‚Äôs business is unprofitable, but despite this, investors are willing to invest in Tesla or Uber (the same example, only with DODO pizza, Fyodor, hello and huge respect).  A person who is interested in our project understands why Amazon bought Whole Foods (a giant American network selling healthy food and not related to IT and other Amazon projects). <br><br>  In conclusion to this article, I would like to invite community members to the discussion.  And also to show some historical pictures from the category as it was.  Because we have something to show;) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ko/vj/_s/kovj_snzcsdwixhzpsvxv3d2a3i.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/i5/j9/i5/i5j9i5ahunuzsd8bdhkg8ckfdma.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jv/3c/sh/jv3cshershqfh7pylq3pim2n5le.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  PS Two months after the presentation of our project, one ‚Äúbig‚Äù and very famous businessman came up with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãopening a restaurant on the blockchain in Moscow.  At the same time, on our letter to him describing the project, he, after 5 minutes of superficial study, put the stamp ‚ÄúSCAM‚Äù.  We are optimistic about this, because healthy competition is the basis for the development of any business. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/345754/">https://habr.com/ru/post/345754/</a></p>
