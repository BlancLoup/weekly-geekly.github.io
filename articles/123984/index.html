I want to talk about the project in which I participated the last four weeks. <br>  In early June, I was offered to fill out a questionnaire to participate in an international labor camp in Hungary.  After completing the questionnaire, displaying the portfolio and interviewing by phone, I was selected as one of the participants from more than 300 applicants from different countries of the world. <br>  So, I went to Hungary to one of the most beautiful places in the world, Lake Balaton, where our campus was located. <br><br><h4>  About the project itself: </h4><br>  The project is called Pangalaktik App Campus: <br>  <a href="http://campus.carnationgroup.com/">Carnation Group</a> , organized by the Hungarian IT-agency <a href="http://www.carnationgroup.com/">Carnation Group</a> (a creative company created in 1997, dedicated to research and development in the field of IT, and has already become a leader among European companies with full-service services). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  What are we creating? </h4><br>  In 4 weeks, 10 selected children from Korea, Estonia, Poland, Russia, India and Hungary are developing <br>  Crowdspottr is a mobile application for iPhone and Android that integrates Facebook and Foursquare databases into a single space and allows you to view all upcoming meetings and friends check-ins depending on your location. <br>  Thus, <a href="http://crowdspottr.com/">Crowdspottr</a> is a very simple and clear tool for planning your free time, meetings, parties, etc. <br>  This application considers Facebook and Foursquare as an information field of opportunities and allows you not only to find out what your friends are going to do next weekend, but what they are doing at the moment. <br><br><img src="http://www.upload.ee/image/1478626/265970_210116575699222_195098423867704_627042_327278_o.jpg" alt="image">

    <h4>  How do we do it? </h4><br>  The application is developed on the basis of a real experiment. <br>  The team consists of graphic and interface designers, iOS and Android developers and is supported by experienced marketers from the Carnation Group. <br>  The development includes the creation of 2 promo clips, a small advertising campaign, a promo site, the site of the application itself, the development of the interface and, accordingly, the development of the application itself and its integration <br><br><h4>  About the work process: </h4><br>  The team was divided into 3 parts - design, marketing and development.  Behind each team was a responsible person from the Carnation group, who introduced the case and gave technical advice.  Throughout our work, we constantly shared tips, exchanged experiences, and brainstormed. <br>  At the moment we are completing work and we are conducting the first user tests of the application, the release is scheduled for the end of July, everyone is looking forward to it. <br><br>  Working in an international team, undoubtedly, each of us got a great experience not only in work, but also in communication, culture, and relationships. <br><br>  I was pleased that there was always a response to non-standard solutions, the management of the company helped to implement them. <br>  Organizing such projects of course, there are always concerns about how well participants are chosen, how well the development will go, and how to make the application really popular ... a lot of things that should be considered and taken into account.  I think that no one will be able to say with complete conviction that the project will be successful ... <br>  In conclusion, I would like to ask how successful such experiments are, how interesting can people be?  It is interesting to know your points of view. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D8JpCheF4rS4%26feature%3Dplayer_embedded">Link to the promo video</a> . <br>  <a href="http://www.crowdspottr.com/">Link to the promo site</a> . <br><br>  <a href="http://www.facebook.com/crowdspottr%3Fref%3Dts">Here you can see how we worked, photos, discussions</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/123984/">https://habr.com/ru/post/123984/</a></p>
