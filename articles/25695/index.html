  <section class="page js-page"><h1>About Lebedev</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The owner of the Studio Artemy Lebedev should be respected and honored not for his design and creative finds, but for the fact that he has been the creator and permanent leader of the largest design studio in Russia for more than 10 years.  If you think that this is not cool, then try at least a pie on the street grandmother to sell.  It is necessary to evaluate the policy of the studio, laid down by Artemiy, which allows to set prices for services at least twice as high as the market ones.  Moreover, this policy was laid initially and is not derived from the current market situation. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  One can argue for a long time about the quality of the studio's work and the responsibility of Lebedev himself in particular.  But in Russia, despite the boom of designers in recent years, no one can be put on the same step as Lebedev Studio, in terms of the quality, volume, and ‚Äústinginess‚Äù of work.  Winners, as they say, are not judged. <br><br>  Actually, it was because of the last sentence that I needed this introduction.  Which will allow me not to smear the main message of this article, like an insect on the windshield, but to present it almost immediately.  So! <br><br>  No matter how successful you are!

      Did you get the inheritance that you successfully invested, or did you earn your capital is not a name at the beginning of a tenge.  You entered the theater thanks to your knowledge, or were selected thanks to the familiar "bump".  The difference is only important grumbling losers sitting in the swamp of their lives.  They envy someone else's success, and in an attempt to somehow reanimate their self-esteem give rise to a similar judgment: ‚ÄúYes Alsou got it all because of her dad.‚Äù <br><br>  By the way, all my acquaintances brusuyatti enjoy using blat as soon as possible, but, nevertheless, continue to trumpet on those who are above them.  This is similar to how people are watching the rout in China, crying in front of TVs.  They are incredibly sorry for the local people, but they are not able to transfer at least a ruble to the charity fund to help the victims.  Because crying and grumbling is simple and pleasant. <br><br>  You only live once, do not waste time and energy on useless evidence to others.  Use all your opportunities for success in life.  If you have the opportunity to use the pull, use it without hesitation. <br><br>  And the main truth that the losers are afraid to admit is as follows.  If you are a sucker pedal, then no cronyism and no starting money will help you in life.  Blat, starting capital, freebies and other benefits are needed for those who really have a chance to achieve a lot in life, they would have achieved without it, but such trifles save a hell of time.  And life is not very long. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/25695/">https://habr.com/ru/post/25695/</a></p>
