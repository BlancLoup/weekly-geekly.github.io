A small batch of a dozen pieces sold quickly, and so we ventured on a larger volume, largely due to your requests. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d40/3f2/305/d403f23051b546efbf2f19fdeab877c5.JPG">

      With your permission, a small post about it. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Good housekeeper vs The best housekeeper</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/75d/0a5/6aa/75d0a56aab644f2892748f47286db475.jpg"><br><br>  For most people, the word ‚Äúhousekeeper‚Äù will first of all create an image of an accessory made of leather, then, probably, a wall-mounted wooden box, then, perhaps, an image of an adult woman in a noble estate. <br><br>  The last one - we are not at all interested, the housekeeper is also passing by, but with mobile accessories it can be a little more detailed. <br><br>  All of them are made in order to organize the keys in your pocket or bag.  Most often - in the bag, because the size of the key holders are such that many of them are trivial in their pockets.  Keychain compression is one of the first and most important tasks. <br><br>  The designer models of the premium segment, which can be seen in boutiques, stand apart: there are completely different rules and reasons for which the accessory is chosen. <br><br>  The second task, which is solved by the key-keeper: ‚Äúsecurity‚Äù of the lining of things or the same pockets.  Collected in a small purse ligament neatly lies and does not cling to anything. <br><br>  And finally, convenience issues: quick access to keys, etc. <br><br>  <b>It is not that simple</b> <br><br>  Frankly speaking, the ‚Äúclassical‚Äù key house does not cope with most of these tasks.  A handbag takes an extra place, which, sometimes, is difficult to allocate for it. <br><br>  As for convenient access, this is still a grandmother in two: you have to unbutton the rivet or zipper. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/23b/2b4/45d/23b2b445defb4f2899eae399dece45d9.jpg"><br><br>  Security?  It is controversial because the balance between grace and efficiency is difficult to maintain.  Please note that the keys in some models also openly stick out with teeth. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/955/570/5cf/9555705cf9b94e7e837123c507ee7938.jpg"><br><br>  And here is such a case.  Not much burdening, but a drawback: he got the key, the rest of the bundle hung in this bag, it was delaying ... It's easier to drop it. <br><br>  Therefore, on the one hand, they began to exploit the topic of key-holders in the premium segment, where the cost of a purse for keys can reach tens of thousands, and on the other, people have ceased to give it at least some attention and recognized for an ideal key-reader: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b5f/62b/f34/b5f62bf34424439ea2e037f4c5b35b9a.jpg"><br>  <i>Cheap, angry, efficient</i> <br><br>  <b>SmartPoket</b> <br><br>  One of the first to feel the ‚Äúwind of change‚Äù was the guys from the KeySmart project, which we honestly wrote in a lot of <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/medgadgets/blog/286562/">detailed material</a> .  The idea instantly began to replicate, <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/smartpoket-organajzer.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_medium%3Dsmartpoket%26utm_campaign%3Dsmartpoketmini">including us</a> .  But! <br><br>  Today we have an advantage that no one, perhaps, can boast of. <br><br>  <b>Key advantage - big key</b> <br><br>  A strange phrase, of course ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0e7/f94/428/0e7f944281bf406e8063a6ca60a64f9f.jpg"><br><br>  This is the first comment we receive and the first request.  Why did it happen that no one thought of it?  In the West, such keys do not have such distribution and popularity, and therefore the need to do something special for them disappears. <br><br>  Even the leather designer items that I saw when walking in the same TSUM measure under the ‚ÄúEuropean‚Äù keys in the overwhelming majority.  KeySmart, the authors of the idea, do not bother at all: I do not like something - just <a href="https://getkeysmart.com/products/sc1-airkey">buy the</a> same keys and that's it. <br><br>  We went the ‚Äúlong‚Äù way <s>(yes, for the day of puns)</s> and made a <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/smartpoket-l.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_medium%3Dsmartpoket%26utm_campaign%3Dsmartpoketlarge">big SmartPoket</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3cf/673/31d/3cf67331d2624ef4b1556d1d1377bbba.JPG"><br><br>  First we need to say that all the ‚Äúbig‚Äù keys are different, and some of them will fit perfectly into the SmartPoket of the basic size. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3bc/a44/7fb/3bca447fb9a04d6aa3e1f51bf3ea0bb9.JPG"><br><br>  However, a number of cases involve going beyond.  To do this, we increased the size of the housekeeper a couple of centimeters. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/485/33d/d1a/48533dd1ae2944958481c58ee732c68f.JPG"><br><br>  The final version was 11 cm versus 9.3 cm in the base. <br><br>  This made it possible to add the desired big key while maintaining the main advantages of the SmartPoket. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f03/0e9/fbd/f030e9fbd7fb47b79e4dfd8f9fc3dd16.JPG"><br><br>  Next question in quantity.  A standard bundle of house keys can hold up to 5 keys.  It is easily realizable.  In my turned a little less. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e09/495/430/e09495430c5647ecb37115f84dd4fb86.JPG"><br><br>  Considering that the handle of a large key is slightly larger, on the opposite side a little more pads may be needed.  They are included. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f1b/f2e/ba8/f1bf2eba8e7c402bb733e69a128879d6.JPG"><br><br>  In general, the "Smartpocket" consists of two plates, fasteners, a set of gaskets, carbine and ring. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1dd/02a/e45/1dd02ae45db646c5a975e49383a6914d.JPG"><br><br>  Carabiner can be used as you like, suitable for those who do not want to part with your favorite key chain. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/257/f8c/904/257f8c9044f74d6d82ed18db73917465.JPG"><br><br>  <b>What we have achieved</b> <br><br><ul><li>  First, SmartPoket really makes the keychain more compact, the keys do not hang out </li><li>  Secondly, thanks to the ‚ÄúSwiss‚Äù mechanism, the SmartPoket provides quick access to the keys; this is also aided by the absence of any fasteners and rivets. </li><li>  Thirdly, such a housekeeper takes very little space in your pocket and minimizes the risk of hooking the lining of clothes or bags </li><li>  Finally, it should be said that in this form it is more convenient to open the door: the key keeper is like a continuation of the key </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a0a/bdd/758/a0abdd7587b24c70bbb479fdca763538.gif"><br><br>  Well, in addition, you can say that nothing dangles, does not hang when you open or close the door. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/03a/c22/aa1/03ac22aa1de14205b6a8d14243df8f02.JPG"><br><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/SPK_manual.pdf">SmartPoket instructions</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/medgadgets/blog/286562/">The first</a> part of the story about how we did it </li></ul><br>  <b>Price SmartPoket</b> <br><br>  Since a large version just appeared, and in many ways we were pushed to this by comments and reviews here and on the site, we decided to share this news with you first. <br><br>  Big version of SmartPoket - <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/smartpoket-l.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_medium%3Dsmartpoket%26utm_campaign%3Dsmartpoketlarge">990 rubles</a> .
