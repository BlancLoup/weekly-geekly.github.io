We have created a new project - OserWin, which we are now trying to show people to attract investors and missing specialists (that is, hands and heads). <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The project is interesting because it is only born, it starts to grow and develop and how we do it, if it is of interest, we will talk about all the results, successes and failures, about what difficulties we encountered, where we had failure and what won a victory.  Experience of promoting a startup - I think it will be interesting and informative.  We have healthy ambitions, an understanding of the project‚Äôs benefits for people and confidence in the successful implementation of our plans. <br><br>  I have long wanted to create something new, original and useful.  It turned out a simple indecent result.

      Our website <a href="http://www.oserwin.com/">www.oserwin.com</a> is a computer-based online game, the main goal of which is to develop in a person a sense of responsibility for their lives.  Behind such loud words is a very simple system of motivation of a person to set goals and achieve them.  The rules of the game are simple. <br><br>  You visit <a href="http://www.oserwin.com/">www.OserWin.com</a> .  Inspect the interface.  Read the rules.  Register.  Knowing and remembering your dream, fix it in the system as a goal, while making a bet with yourself.  Set the date you reach the goal and bet.  The minimum bet is $ 1.  Initially, the player is given 5 virtual dollars, which he can freely use in the system.  The player determines the fact of winning or losing himself; this question lies entirely on his conscience.  Money You can not win here, Here you get something else - the desire for success, the desire for a better life, the desire for progress, the desire for an active life position.  And the money rate is needed for stimulus, feeding, for the active and fruitful work of memory - ‚ÄúI strive for this, I decided to become the best.  I have to get it.  I will learn it. ‚Äù  In any case, if you want to return your money during the flow of the Bet, you can claim your winnings and get money back (with the exception of commissions that are taken by electronic payment systems).  If you decide to play until the end - then in case of a win - before the expiration of the bet or in the next 12 hours, you must confirm this fact and receive the bet bet back into your account.  In the case of non-fulfillment of the commitments taken, confirm the fact of losing the Bet, and then the bet goes to the OserWin system.  At the moment, the OserWin system works with WebMoney and E-Gold electronic units. <br>  In general, this system is designed for wider use.  Interesting interactive projects will be created in the format of this game. <br><br>  It is interesting to compare our game with games in casinos, on sweepstakes, in bookmakers.  In these games, the passive attitude of a person to the process is assumed in advance.  This a priori is not the most successful position.  In most of these games, the result depends little on the player, and in many it does not depend at all.  Time and energy spent on participating in these games could be devoted to more useful and exciting.  In our Game, a person himself enters himself into excitement, into useful excitement, only the result of an event depends on him and only the Person himself at OserWin decides whether the bet is won or not. <br><br>  The game contributes to the emergence of a dream, creating a goal.  People, coming to OserWin, can see what others are striving for, will think how to surprise themselves and those around them, what else can be done with the unusual and audacious.  There you can share experiences and get tips.  It is interesting - who, as his reached. <br><br>  We will be glad if someone offers their comments, help, participation or in another form shows interest. <br><br>  Thank! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/8668/">https://habr.com/ru/post/8668/</a></p>
