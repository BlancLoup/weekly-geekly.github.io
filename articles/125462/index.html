The specificity of these companies is that the team, as a rule, is small and consists mainly of young people, and often part of the staff works remotely. <br><br>  The most common way is to create a team, and with it the team spirit and teamwork following the strategic goals of the company. <br><br>  But to declare this is one thing, but to realize it is completely different.  As it turned out.

    <a name="habracut"></a>  What problems we personally encountered: <br><br><h5>  Misunderstanding: where are we actually going? </h5><br>  To our great shame, it turned out recently that our staff answered the question ‚ÄúIn the web studio‚Äù to the question: ‚ÄúWhere do you work?‚Äù  Given that the last six months, the leadership only says (apparently among themselves ...) that we should not be associated with design studios in any way, we are a consulting company that develops web applications and e-commerce tools. . <br><br><h5>  Work on the project: who is responsible for what? </h5><br>  When working on a complex project, areas of responsibility are periodically confused, and even more often shifted to each other.  The result of this is to find out directly in front of the dead line that ‚Äúthere are no materials to fill yet‚Äù, ‚Äúthe design of pages X and Y is unfinished‚Äù, ‚Äúthe layout designer thought that this project was not burning‚Äù.  And the more participants in the project, the more confusing. <br><br><h5>  Lack of uniform corporate rules </h5><br>  From a project to a project, a situation arises when the same interface elements are executed differently by different designers: links with underlining, without underlining, headings - who is in that much.  The art director, of course, has his own vision, but each new designer arriving on the team strives to bring in something of his own, with his own concept of usability convenience (and sometimes with the lack of a concept - but that‚Äôs another story). <br><br><h5>  Time to design </h5><br>  Good intentions lined the road to ... But getting rid of them is not so easy.  The most common situation: the project budget is limited and the designer is given some time to make a good design.  In the process of work, an idea is born!  An idea that requires more time and creative effort.  But good!  Without it, the project already seems bland.  And the whole group working on the project rushes to its implementation, working at a loss.  We have this work on a portfolio called. <br><br><h5>  Motivation </h5><br>  The problems of motivation in our team are the following - the performers are not rewarded for the project, everything is organized on internal motivation and responsibility for their work.  The truth is that one does not always have to rely on this internal responsibility, especially when the project ‚Äúdoes not go‚Äù, and the fuse for all participants smoothly slips away. <br><br>  In general, it is sometimes quite difficult to establish a competent work process, especially when all forces rush more to search for orders than to manage.  I would like to discuss how to still make work in an IT company comfortable for its employees and management. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/125462/">https://habr.com/ru/post/125462/</a></p>
