The center is well equipped with modern equipment for the production of 3D prototypes, laser cutting, engraving, vacuum casting and much more. <br><br>  At the end of last year, our company began shipping 3D-printers Raise3D to Russia, signing an exclusive contract with this manufacturer and one of the first 3D printers, <a href="http://www.cvetmir3d.ru/3d-printery/domashnie/raise3d/3d-printer-raise3d-n2-plus/">Raise3D N2 Plus,</a> was installed in the 3D Printing Lab.

      We discussed with Ivan Moshkin, the creator and the head of the 3D Printing Lab, what the company now lives, what successes have been achieved, and, of course, his impressions of <a href="http://www.cvetmir3d.ru/avtorizatsii/raise3d/">Raise3D</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cc2/44b/faf/cc244bfafa16425a9f8e6356eeefef4c.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <i>Ivan, we, as official distributors of Raise3D, are primarily interested in your impressions of the N2 Plus Dual model.</i>  <i>Tell us why you chose this model?</i> <br><br>  We are carefully choosing equipment for our needs, and at the end of last year we had a need for an FDM 3D printer with a large print camera; such a printer would allow us to print large-sized products as a whole, rather than in parts.  We chose from several models, and in the Raise3D N2 Plus Dual attracted several key points: <br><br><ol><li>  Two extruders that are very much needed when printing models with soluble supports </li><li>  Large construction area 305 * 305 * 610 mm and at the same time closed housing </li><li>  Replaceable nozzles of large diameter 0.8 mm., Which speeds up printing large models </li><li>  Extruder design that allows printing with various materials </li><li>  Finally, the price of a printer, which is about two times lower than similar models from the USA and Europe, has become an important factor. </li></ol><br>  <i>The printer is in your operation for about 1.5 months, did it meet your expectations?</i> <br><br>  I can immediately identify several indisputable advantages of the printer.  Having your own battery allows you to resume printing in case of problems with electricity, when the model is printed for days - this is a very useful feature.  At power off the printer will remember a place of a stop and will continue the press from it.  The printer is very quiet, it turned out to be a very important advantage, given the fact that something is constantly printed on it.  Another plus is the ability to change a number of print options already during printing.  Also recently, we were pleased with the updated software iDeaMaker, in which the Russian language appeared. <br><br>  <i>Perhaps you had time to identify any shortcomings?</i> <br><br>  There is a lack of a plastic termination sensor.  We also believe that the wheels are not the best solution, I would like to have an alternative in the form of legs, our printer always stands in one place, we would prefer a standard printer stand. <br><br>  <i>Regarding the end of the supply of plastic - will soon be such an option.</i> <br><br>  Wonderful.  We will definitely get this update. <br><br>  <i>For what purpose do you use Raise3D N2 Plus Dual?</i> <br><br>  Mainly for prototyping large models and objects of industrial design.  For example, the weight of this part is more than a kilogram; its Raise3D printed in 44 hours, taking into account the size and complexity, is quite a good result. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/580/5a3/a92/5805a3a92ade48ec8540b31daeeda210.jpg"><br><br>  We also use a printer for the manufacture of artificial limbs, orthoses, skulls for medical institutions.  If we talk about printing materials, we have already used PLA, ABS, HIPS, as well as transparent plastic SBS. <br><br>  <i>Ivan, tell us about the main activities of your TsMITa?</i> <br><br>  At the moment, there are 3 main areas: <br><br><ul><li>  rendering services in prototyping, 3D printing, 3D scanning; </li><li>  laser cutting; </li><li>  teaching adults and children to work on digital equipment: 3D printers, scanners, laser machines. </li></ul><br>  Today, in our center the following classes are held: <br><br>  3D prototyping for adults, the basics of working on a 3D printer, modeling in Fusion 360, basics of working with non-standard materials and post-processing, laser cutting and engraving, engineering CAD design for adults.  By the way, our students recently won first place in laser technology at the Moscow Junior Skills Championship. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/01a/e29/5bb/01ae295bbcb7452cb32ae213de4437dd.jpg"><br><br>  We sincerely congratulate you and your pupils with success and wish you further achievements and victories, we hope that the Raise3D equipment will help you in this. <br><br>  The team of the company <a href="http://www.cvetmir3d.ru/">Color World</a> <br><br>  By tradition, a minute of advertising) Buying equipment in our company, you get 10 advantages: <br><br>  1. Ability to use the program Trade In. <br>  2. Warranty - 12 months <br>  3. Instructions in Russian <br>  4. Technical support during the whole period of operation. <br>  5.
