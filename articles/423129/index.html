    <h2>  Myth 1 </h2><br><h3>  ‚ÄúI'm too old to learn English‚Äù </h3><br>  One of the most popular myths.  It comes to the fact that 20-year-old young people use it. <br><br>  There is a popular belief that English should be taught in early childhood - then its study is much faster and more productive.  It seems like psychologists have proven that the children's brain is much more susceptible to the perception of languages. <br><br>  It sounds beautiful, but it's a lie. <br><br>  In fact, an adult's brain can learn English with exactly the same efficiency as a child.  It's all about motivation.  A child‚Äôs motivation is an interest, a desire to learn something new, to brag about his knowledge.  And this motivation is enough for effective work. <br><br>  But the motivation of an adult is a separate issue.  After all, if you are suddenly sent to live in another country, then learning the language will receive absolute priority, and after 2 months you will be able to understand the language and speak it well. <br><br>  So age doesn‚Äôt matter if you learn English.  To study it is real even in 60. <br><br><h2>  Myth 2 </h2><br><h3>  "I have no ability to learn languages" </h3><br>  Wow, how many people really think so.  A person tries to learn a language, faces difficulties - it‚Äôs really necessary to learn, not just watch cartoons - and leave. <br><br>  It is easier to justify their unwillingness to strain the lack of ability.  It comes to the fact that a person begins to believe in it himself. <br><br>  In reality, the understanding and memorization of educational material depends on the general predisposition and perception of information. <br><br>  Let's take a look at the examples. <br><br><ul><li>  If a student perceives visual information better, then he will work better with exercises and text. </li><li>  If a student is predisposed to hearing, then listening, listening to audio exercises, and speaking conversations are best for him. </li></ul><br><br>  Each person perceives the world around him in his own way.  And if one method of learning English did not bring results, it makes sense to try something radically different. <br><br>  Abilities have each, without exception.  The main thing is to find a method for learning English that is right for you. <br><br><h2>  Myth 3 </h2><br><h3>  "I have a bad memory" </h3><br>  Memory is a very subjective concept.  For some reason, the poems in school are learning with great suffering, but the lyrics of their favorite songs are remembered by themselves, and no effort is needed for that. <br><br>  When the brain processes new information, it creates associative connections with already existing knowledge.  And the higher the interest in information, the more actively formed communication. <br><br><blockquote>  The basis of associative perception is based on the principles of mnemonics - quick memorization. </blockquote><br><br>  That interest is directly related to the memory capabilities.  If you are listening to a song that you like, associative links are created extremely actively.  All because you enjoy it. <br><br>  And if a student learns something "under the lash", then the effectiveness of this method of study will be only slightly higher than zero.  And all because there is no interest, new associative links are not formed and information is erased by the brain as unnecessary in just a few days. <br><br>  To "trick" the brain, you just need to make study interesting.  To do this, use interactive teaching methods, <a href="https://www.englishdom.com/home/%3Futm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_source%3Dhabra%26utm_campaign%3Dmythbusters">online simulators</a> , communicate with interesting people. <br><br>  High interest will push the brain to create associative chains, even for complex and complex knowledge.  And the information will be memorized for a long time. <br><br>  So ‚Äúbad memory‚Äù is not an argument.  You just do not know how to use it. <br><br><h2>  Myth 4 </h2><br><h3>  "I have no time to study" </h3><br>  Stupid argument that is still used to justify their laziness and unwillingness to learn. <br><br>  To learn English, you need no more than 30 minutes a day.  It is at this time that many courses and programs are designed. <br><br>  30 minutes is a trip to the subway, a medium length traffic jam or half a lunch break. <br><br>  You can find a bunch of opportunities a day to learn English.  The main thing is to do it constantly, without interruptions and passes. <br><br>  ‚ÄúNo time‚Äù is an excuse.  Yes, and that is very bad quality.  She only testifies to the absence of fantasy to come up with something more original.  Time can always be found, but the desire to do something is often not enough. <br><br><h2>  Myth 5 </h2><br><h3>  ‚ÄúWhy learn a language if you can use Google Translate?‚Äù </h3><br>  Google Translate's neural networks really show excellent mechanical translation results.  But with a real translator they can not be compared for many more years. <br><br>  Explain why.  There are relatives-languages ‚Äã‚Äãlike Ukrainian, Russian and Belarusian.  The rules and features of the grammar in them are very similar, so the mechanical translation will be accurate. <br><br>  And what to do with those languages ‚Äã‚Äãwhose grammar differs radically?  The system creates a bunch of categories with which it can differentiate meanings. <br><br>  But how, for example, translate into English the phrase "Green greens green greens"?  Any variants of phrases that are not in memory, the system translates inaccurately.  Therefore, translators are needed now and will be needed in the future. <br><br>  In addition, Google Translate is not as convenient as it may seem.  For live communication with foreigners, it is not suitable at all. <br><br>  So to be able to handle technology is a plus, but knowledge of the language will not replace it.  In any case, another 20 years so sure. <br><br><h2>  Myth 6 </h2><br><h3>  "You can learn English only in the language environment" </h3><br>  If you have the opportunity to go to the United States or Britain to study the language - this is excellent.  The results will be visible in a few weeks - simply because you have to constantly communicate in English, every minute of your day. <br><br>  But if there is no such possibility, it is not scary.  This is not the only effective way to learn a language. <br><br>  You can communicate with foreigners at least every day - there are a lot of language exchange sites on the Internet.  Sign up, choose a buddy and improve your skills. <br><br>  Yes, in training "at home" there is no so-called "novice swimmer stress" when a person is thrown into a hostile environment.  In our case, this is the environment of people who speak a foreign language.  But this way is overestimated.  You can perfectly learn a language without ever having been to the United States or Britain.  Internet and properly selected courses do wonders. <br><br><h2>  Myth 7 </h2><br><h3>  ‚ÄúEnglish can be easily learned by yourself‚Äù </h3><br>  If you want to learn English on your own, this is a great aspiration.  But the question is that it is extremely difficult to do this absolutely without help. <br><br>  Salt is that without mistakes, learning the language just will not do.  And if there is no one to correct them and instruct the student on the right path, they will accumulate.  What is most unpleasant is that a person will consider what he says and writes correctly, but in reality this will not be so. <br><br>  There is nothing bad in the mistakes themselves - they help us to improve and find ‚Äúthin spots‚Äù in knowledge.  But they benefit only if they make the work on the errors in time and remember the correct option. <br><br>  Special online simulators and <a href="https://www.englishdom.com/courses/%3Futm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_source%3Dhabra%26utm_campaign%3Dmythbusters">courses</a> allow you to reduce the number of errors to almost zero.  But a living teacher will be able to much better explain to you incomprehensible topics and advise what to pay attention to in studying. <br><br>  As a result, the myth can be considered half confirmed.  You can learn English on your own, but the quality of such learning can vary from excellent to terrible. <br><br><h2>  Myth 8 </h2><br><h3>  ‚ÄúLearning English is too expensive‚Äù </h3><br>  Have you checked the prices of English classes for a long time?  Today there are a huge number of teachers and schools of the English language, which work on Skype.  This reduces the cost and simplifies the interaction. <br><br>  You can replenish vocabulary through online simulators and courses, but it is better to work it out with a teacher. <br><br>  If you wish, you can easily invest in 1000 rubles per month and learn English at the maximum of its capabilities.  But there are even better deals. <br><br>  Leave a <a href="https://www.englishdom.com/%3Futm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_source%3Dhabra%26utm_campaign%3Dmythbusters">request for a free introductory lesson</a> on Skype and receive when you first pay with the promo code <a href="https://www.englishdom.com/prices/goodhabr2/%3Futm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_source%3Dhabra%26utm_campaign%3Dmythbusters">goodhabr2</a> +2 lessons as a gift.
