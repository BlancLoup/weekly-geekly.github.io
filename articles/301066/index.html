  <section class="page js-page"><h1>VeeamON Forum is coming: Moscow-2016</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  So, on May 26 in Moscow we are hosting the second Russian VeeamON Forum - the main event of Veeam, covering the issues of data availability in modern data centers.  We invite readers of the Veeam blog and profile hubs (‚ÄúBackup‚Äù, ‚ÄúData Recovery‚Äù and ‚ÄúVirtualization‚Äù) to take part in it. <br><br>  Immediately I will inform you that participation is free, but registration is required, since the number of places is still limited.  Like last year, we prepared a couple of pleasant surprises for the participants of the Habr's forum.  Read more about all this, as well as the program of the forum this year, read under the cut. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/57b/384/a57/57b384a57f134c14a77e9f943c4d6c51.jpg"><br><br><h1>  Let's VeeamON </h1><br>  The VeeamON Forum event is the Russian-language equivalent of the international conference VeeamON, which takes place annually in the USA (and about which my colleague also did not fail to write an interesting <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/veeam/blog/271401/">report</a> for our readers).  In Russia, the forum premiered last year.  The event was opened by the president of Veeam Software, Ratmir Timashev, and then a very rich program awaited participants and guests.  To feel the atmosphere of VeeamON and imagine how you feel when you join our forum on May 26th, you can watch a short <a href="https://vimeo.com/130730290">video</a> or read our last year‚Äôs <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/veeam/blog/260603/">report here on Habr√©</a> .

    <h1>  Who is in the program </h1><br>  Three key speakers for this year‚Äôs conference have been announced: <br><ul><li>  <i>Daniel Fried, Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing, Veeam</i> - can be called the visionary of the concept of Availability for Always-On Enterprise.  Daniel will tell you how he sees the development of the IT industry in the future and which technologies, in his opinion, should be paid attention today. </li><li>  <i>Vasily Vaganov, Regional Director Veeam, Russia and the CIS</i> - this person is well versed in the business and IT market.  How to correctly calculate investments in IT infrastructure, which is beneficial in the future - with these questions you can contact him. </li><li>  <i>Vitaly Savchenko, Head of the group of system engineers at Veeam, Russia and the CIS</i> , is, so to speak, the ‚Äúcarrier of technical knowledge‚Äù of the team.  He is just returning from the training of system engineers Veeam and ‚Äúhot on the heels‚Äù will reveal to you the "secrets of the company": what features does the version of Veeam Availability Suite v9.5, what are the latest news on the release of backup for Linux, and what new products to expect in the near future. </li></ul><br>  Of course, much interest is expected in the speeches of the sponsors of the event - they are also the leading vendors of the IT market: Netapp, Cisco, HPE and Microsoft. <br><br>  And, as always, prepare your questions, for we traditionally plan for free communication of forum participants with our customers.  They will tell you how the solutions were implemented, where they succeeded, and where they made mistakes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/46f/547/52b/46f54752bd0143e9bce3bf243c2596f2.jpg"><br><br><h1>  What do we do?  Chat! </h1><br>  <b>The main goal of the forum is the exchange of experience, knowledge and business cards</b> :) We think over the event so that you have time and place to meet and talk with colleagues.  Join the discussion with the speakers, ask questions at the Q &amp; A session or leave them on the <a href="https://go.veeam.com/veeamon-forum-moscow-ask-veeam/">site</a> . <br><br>  <b>The second part of the forum is laboratory work</b> .  They will be held in parallel with the main session.  Under the guidance of system engineers, you can learn how Veeam solutions work: from basic setup to restore machines, files, and application objects.  Signing up for technical training should be done here via this <a href="https://go.veeam.com/veeamon-forum-moscow-labs/">link</a> , and it is advisable not to delay this, because, as experience shows from conducting similar trainings, there will most likely not be any vacancies on the day of the event. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/618/29a/288/61829a28800b4cb1a9224ab6ecfa574b.jpg"><br><br><h1>  Attention to our subscribers and readers of the blog Veeam on Habr√©! </h1><br>  This invitation would not be here if we did not plan gifts for you.  There will be two of them: BlackBeat Pro headphones and Samsung Gear S2 smart watches will find their owners on the forum! <br>  Specify your nickname on Habr√© when registering on the forum or tell the girl at the entrance that you are from Habr.  You will be given two badges - one for you personally, and the other will be put into the drum for drawing prizes.  At 5.00 pm, the Veeam team will be waiting for you at the press-wall with the words ‚ÄúVeeam on Habr√©‚Äù.  Here you can meet in person, take a snapshot of the memory and, of course, we will play two declared gifts. <br><br>  <b>Well, again, so as not to be forgotten: the VeeamON Forum will be held on May 26, 2016 at the Radisson Slavyanskaya Hotel in Moscow;</b>  <b>participation is free, registration is required</b> (online registration <a href="https://go.veeam.com/veeamon-forum-moscow/">here</a> ). <br><br>  The material used photos from the event last year, the story of how it was in 2015 - <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/veeam/blog/260603/">here</a> . <br><br>  This time will be even more interesting. <br>  See you! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/301066/">https://habr.com/ru/post/301066/</a></p>
