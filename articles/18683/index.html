The film is not about piracy.  The film is not about file sharing.  The film is a study of tremendous changes in how we produce, distribute and consume information products. <br><a name="habracut"></a>  Steal This Film 2 is presented by the League of Noble Peers at the end of 2007.  For the first four days, the number of downloads reached 150,000. It is interesting that people were very generous in donations, for those days were about $ 5000. <br><br>  When the first part came out, the League of Noble Peers asked for $ 1 (or more) if someone wanted to support the project.  It is not surprising that such contributions made up the bulk of the entire fund.  However, donations of a new release are $ 15 or more.  Why?  Maybe the reason for this is the ‚Äúmystery gift‚Äù (promised in the credits), which they will receive if the donation is more than $ 15, but there are alternative explanations - maybe pirates are more generous than is commonly believed. <br><br>  Jamie King, the film‚Äôs producer, gives the following explanation on his <a href="http://jamie.com/2008/01/03/the-future-doesnt-care-about-your-bank-balance-but-the-11000-do/" title="blog post">blog</a> : ‚ÄúMore than 90% of people's donations are above the $ 15 artificial threshold we set.  But I do not think that people literally want this gift.  I think they want a pretext to be generous! ‚Äù

      This could be true, people who donated (their still small percentage, fasting) were motivated by their generosity.  Also, maybe they donate more, because they see no reason to donate as little as $ 1 - even the pirates do not want to look stingy.  Perhaps the most important thing is that it is wise to avoid psychological resistance and choose where to make a donation and where to spend money as a consumer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/787/218/8dd/7872188dd3a20dc4fd07d3948db22946.jpg" width="450" height="255" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">  It is a challenge to build a business model based on disinterested will and free content, ‚ÄúStolen‚Äù.  The project of this film shows that there is a way to do it. <br>  Another interesting thing reviewed by Jamie in his post.  This is the need for an alternative payment model.  Of course, PayPal works, but they take too much money - it replaces one intermediary, sucking money, with another.  For example, take a look at the Radiohead release, formally you can get it for free, but you still have to pay a company that contains a credit card for about $ 1.  That's probably why most people downloaded the pirate album, instead of getting it ‚Äúfor free‚Äù.  It seems, The Pirate Bay agree with this, because  based on the p2p business model, which can be presented by the end of the month. <br><br>  Some time ago, TorrentFreak briefly spoke with Brokep about this upcoming project, unfortunately, we can not tell you the details, but it is absolutely certain that this is an interesting project with great potential.  Brokep spread a bit in Jamie's blog: ‚ÄúPeople pay if there is a very simple way to do it.  The situation with payments today is not suitable for the current economy - now everything is based on the old one.  While we are moving away from the old economic system, we do not have new solutions. ‚Äù <br><br>  BitTorrent opens up opportunities for independent cinema.  No cost for distribution!  New business models are emerging.
