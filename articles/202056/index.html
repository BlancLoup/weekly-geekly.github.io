To the universe as a whole and to your karma or something. <br><br>  In general, I got compic.  Dell PowerEdge 400SC (Service Tag: 2KF6641).  And I decided to connect it to the TV, because it seemed to me that this is the only way to watch flash content on TV. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <i>By the way, excellent lyrical digression.</i>  <i>In the yard in 2013.</i>  <i>I have a MacBook (late 2007) at home, an iPad, two iPhones, a Samsung Smart TV, an Apple TV.</i>  <i>And there is a website that exclusively (everyone understands what it means, right?) Broadcasts some kind of sports content.</i>  <i>Those.</i>  <i>Competitions can be viewed only on this site.</i>  <i>The site has only a set of flash movies - some of them are recorded, some stream events in real time.</i>  <i>I hope it is clear.</i>  <i>There are no applications for mobile devices - i.e.</i>  <i>iPhones and iPads go to the forest.</i>  <i>There is no streaming, i.e.</i>  <i>smart tv goes forest.</i>  <i>You can watch it on the MacBook, but since it is 2007, it cannot transfer video to Apple TV, i.e.</i>  <i>Macbook is a forest.</i>  <i>As a result, the MacBook is the only device that can play this content.</i>  <i>The support answer is simple - when you paid for our services, you agreed with the rules of their provision.</i>  <i>That's just some sort of lolshto.</i> <br><br>  So, I got a comp.  Normal such a computer - I stuck 2 gigabytes of memory in there, loaded XP, ran chrome and made sure that the content was shown.  Things are easy - put it all on TV.  There is a problem - the output of the video card is one (ATI Rage XL).  And one more - you need to give the disk with XP to the old owner.  Well, respectively, something to put in place of XP.  Went asked the guys - put, they say XBMCbuntu.  Well, okay, then put it.  Created a flash drive, boot.  The download goes until the computer switches to the graphics mode, after which the monitor is stupidly chopped off.  I went to the Internet, they say - and, by the way, yes, the old ATI cards are not supported, they dropped support.  Well, figs with them, it's still a single-headed card and not what I need.  I went to ebay and bought nVidia GeForce FX 5950 ultra for $ 6.  There is a way out for DVI, and it would seem there should be no problems with firewood.

      Card arrived.  Boot into XP, connected the computer to the TV with a DVI &lt;-&gt; HDMI cable.  Peace and quiet, and God's grace.  Those.  There is nothing on the TV, it does not show.  About a day of antics and jumps with firewood, I‚Äôm slowly remembering shaggy years and the realization that they say yes, I already forgot how to connect a second monitor.  Reboot, Force Detection, RivaTuner, nVidia TV Tool - and nothing.  I began to sin on the cable - but I connected a second monitor with another DVI cable, I found it safely, I pulled out the cable from the second monitor and stuck the cable from the tele - there was a great high-quality picture on the tele.  Those.  Hard all works perfectly - just the telly does not recognize vidyuhi that he quite even can.  Well, there is no possibility in XP to say firewood - hey, guys, let's get a picture of such a resolution in the DVI output and come what may.  All too smart. <br><br>  Well, I'm not hoping for XP.  We put XBMCbuntu, load, voila - an image appeared on the main monitor, the card works in graphic one-headed mode.  We are looking for multimonitoring settings - there are none.  The telly is not detected.  We begin to do the things for which everything was started - the granular control of the axis, the ability to teleport massive objects in a single line in configs and turn back time. <br><br>  The first attempt is to tell XBMCbuntu firewood to send a picture to DVI forcibly.  We are looking for and find information in the internet about how to do this.  You need to add the ‚ÄúConnectedMonitor‚Äù ‚ÄúDFP‚Äù option in the /etc/X11/xorg.conf file.  Everything turned out to be simple. <br><br>  Only there is no such file in XBMCBuntu.  Was, because in all forums there are references to him, but at some point he was dropped.  Attempts to create your file led to the fact that the graphics mode simply fell off, and after loading the monitor was cut down. <br><br>  And nafik me this XBMCbuntu, if I can roll Ubuntu and run the same xbmc on top of it?  But at least I will have a normal uncircumcised axis with the software center, where I can put all kinds of firewood just by writing ‚Äúdrivers‚Äù in the search string, I thought. <br><br>  We start to put ubuntu.  In the installation process, we reach the disk partitioning, create all the partitions, select the disk for installation, press the button further and for the three or four seconds that pass between the user's action and the axis loaded from the USB flash drive, we have time to see that there is still a dropdown for the choice of where to write the boot sector, and in this dropdown, the disk on which we selected the partition was chosen, but rather a small disk with XP installed.  The "back" button in the installer is there, but it is hopelessly zadeybeblen.  To save a disk with XP, cut down the computer from the button, start the procedure again.  And this is all meeeeeleeeeno.  Guys, very slowly.  10-15 minutes first before the start of the installation is easy.  And already night.  Already sleep hunting, a state of complete dullness.  In short, we repeat the same mistake (damn, because I already knew about this set-up! Well, how can that be?!?!?), But there is no way to cancel, roll back, return it backwards.  Again we reboot, another 15 minutes.  It seems to recheck everything, set up the mount points to the already created partitions.  Click further.  Ubuntu swears that some sections were not selected for formatting.  And freezes.  Another 15 minutes and the installation seems to have gone.  I'm not even angry, it's half past one night, I'm already sausage, but I hope that everything will work and I will at least go to sleep in a normal mood. <br><br>  Everything went through the installation, I load and see ... a black screen with a mouse cursor on it.  Well, I wait for some time, but it is obvious that everything, the download is over.  I climb into the Internet, I find it brilliant: "This is usually because you have an Nvidia or AMD graphics card" (http://askubuntu.com/questions/162075/my-computer-boots-to-a-black-screen-what- options-do-i-have-to-fix-it). <br>  Dude, seriously.  This usually happens because you have an Nvidia or AMD graphics card.  And what cards are no problems?  With integrated graph from Intel?  Matroks multihead buy?  Or blow dust from 3dfx Voodoo? <br><br>  Well, ok, trying to do something with the driver.  FAKI, askubuntu and anything.  I find something like a utility for updating firewood - jockey-text (why? Why is it called jockey-text?).  I see it as an opportunity to choose a driver, choose nVidia-evsky driver instead of the open-sors driver, I reboot.  I see nVidia-Yevsky splashscreen, i.e.  We confidently work in graphic mode!  After that, the monitor goes out.  Terminals (ctrl + alt + f2) stop responding, i.e.  car dully hanging.  And the strength is gone, I go to sleep at half past two at night. <br><br>  Why am I writing all this?  Guys, I bow to Linux.  From scratch to do this.  Just community efforts!  I love breaking my routers, learning, not giving up right away, not trying to expect Windows behavior from Linux and trying to comprehend Unix-Way.  But, damn, it's hell.  When you unload a window manager or a graphical environment, I don‚Äôt know what exactly it is called, and after that you can‚Äôt turn it back on because it seems to be running, but it isn‚Äôt in the process list (http://askubuntu.com/questions/77330 / lightdm-will-not-start-after-stopping-it, the person writes: [UPDATE: I appreciate it, while ago.]).  Understand, the Windows is at least loaded to the desktop and I can launch the browser and search for information in the internet.  And what to do in ubunt?  Set lynx and search for problems in text mode?).  And you propose to put my Ubuntu on my mom's computer?  In my case, it will not even end the installation.  Well, the problem - how to solve? <br><br>  In general, I am angry.  I, of course, understand that haters gonna hate, that what I am doing now is called habr-suicide, and so on and so forth.  But, damn, you can not shove Ubuntu on the desktop man in the street.  It will take another century before it turns from our geek nyashki into the house-living axis.  Because you never explain to a person that in order to change the settings of a video card, you need to do this: <br><br><pre><code class="bash">sudo apt-get install python-software-properties pkg-config
