  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Online business card</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hi, Habrayuzer! <br><br>  Some time ago, in one conversation about the meaning of blogs in a person‚Äôs life, such an idea came up: any blog is a person‚Äôs self-presentation on the net.  I do not propose now to discuss this thesis; I will tell you about the thought that led me to. <br><br>  Many people have a lot of different accounts and registrations, and many where users write something and somehow.  Thus, to form an opinion about a person, you need to run through all his accounts - which is not always convenient.  Why not create a service that aggregates basic information about a person posted on the web and reflects its Internet activity?

      I want to share the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa similar project. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><h4>  Idea: </h4><br>  The modern Internet user, who has dozens of registrations on a multitude of services, often lacks a place where it would be possible to combine all these places of their activity. <br><br>  An online business card is a page containing information about the user, his blogs, accounts on forums, social networks, etc. and information from them. <br><br><h4>  Goals: </h4><br><ol><li>  provide any network user the opportunity to collect all information about himself and his network activity in one place, </li><li>  give the opportunity to manage all your registrations, as well as track the mention of your name / contacts in search engines, </li><li>  store other people's contacts. </li></ol><br>  Business card structure: <br><br><ol><li>  User Profile: <br>  Information on the page is filled automatically from the profiles that the user specifies.  Say, the photo is taken from VKontakte, avatar and age - from LJ, car brand - from Drayv2.ru. <br>  Variants of information that may contain business card: <br><ul><li>  registration in blogs and social networks, </li><li>  messengers, </li><li>  phone numbers and addresses </li><li>  summary, </li><li>  cars, </li><li>  e-wallets </li><li>  posts, </li><li>  User references in search engines </li><li>  anything else </li></ul><br><br>  Thus, the user does not need to fill in anything on his own - well, except for links to his accounts.  However, the content of the page can be customized: what information from which services to take, how to display it, etc. <br><br>  In addition to the basic information taken from profiles on other resources, the business card may also contain related information - for example, karma at Habrahabr or the number / dynamics of friends in LJ. </li><li>  Tape updates - the latest posts in LiveJournal, Dairi, Twitter, VKontakte notes, status in ICQ, etc., as well as links to mentioning the name / contacts / other parameters in search engines - in the form of a tape (as is done, for example, on design .ru). </li><li>  Bookmarks - links to the cards of other users of the service.  This part of the service is hidden, it is not an analogue of franding and is needed only for the convenience of the user. </li></ol><br><h4>  Additional features: </h4><br><ul><li>  A business card can be imported - in several formats at once, readable by, say, mobile phones or simply as a text document. </li><li>  The type and content of the business card can be customized in accordance with several standard scenarios: for dating, for employers, for the media, for yourself, for friends. </li><li>  The ability to create your own business card usage scenarios and set the parameters of displayed information and privacy. </li><li>  Ability to choose from several skins design, as well as create your own designs </li><li>  The ability to tie a business card on your site. </li><li>  Widgets for profiles on other services </li></ul><br><h4>  Confidentiality: </h4><br><br>  By default, all information in the business card is open, the user can configure several degrees of hiding: only for users, only for invitees, personal (hidden from all). <br><br>  The degree of concealment ‚Äúonly for invitees‚Äù is a feature of the service.  As in the case of a real business card, the online business card can only be seen by the owner. <br><br>  In this case, the user sends an email to someone who wants to show his business card, an invitation - a unique link that can be accessed only once (options - within 24 hours, or with another restriction).  To view the business card next time, the invitee needs to enter his email address on the business card page, and the unique generated code will be sent again. <br><h4>  Monetization: </h4><br><ul><li>  Contextual advertising - set only at the request of the user, the project receives only a commission. </li><li>  <i>The most common way to make money is advertising, especially the contextual one that suggests here, which is not suitable for such a service.</i>  <i>It is impossible to imagine a person who would place a random ad from the ‚ÄúFrom hand to hand‚Äù newspaper on his business card (only if he is not an employee of this newspaper).</i>  <i>Similarly, here, when visiting a user's business card, any person should see only the information that the user deemed necessary to provide.</i> </li><li>  ‚ÄúSponsored accounts‚Äù - skins for a business card made in the style of the advertiser and with a link to his website.  Suitable fans of certain brands or those who like this particular design option. </li><li>  Sale of third level domains :) </li><li>  Other options. </li></ul><br><h4>  Perspective directions of development of the service: </h4><br><ul><li>  Corporate business cards </li><li>  Special services, such as employee search or dating service. </li><li>  The ability to fasten a business card on your site </li><li>  Provision of openid-provider services or development of the service on the principle of Gravatar (importing information about yourself from the page of the business card when registering for new services). </li></ul><br><h4>  Why this particular service? </h4><br><ol><li>  Usefulness - existing aggregator services are not fully functional and sharpened only, say, for blogs - the business card can also be a person who does not have blogs, but is registered on some forum or simply contain one single field: search results by reference. </li><li>  Multi-functionality - the ability to customize a business card for a specific task (work, dating, etc). </li><li>  Openness - to use a read-only service (for example, to see a business card at the invitation of their mailbox), you do not need to register on it to go to another site - you do not need to go through to confirm this desire, and in the future you can use your business card at all site as one of the pages </li><li>  Unobtrusive - on the business card page there will be no advertising, except for the approved user, and for which he receives money. </li><li>  Simplicity - by default, the user does not need to fill in the information "about himself" - it is enough to specify links to your profiles in other services, then the system will collect everything by itself. </li><li>  Convenience - the service can be used in non-public form to manage its activity on the Internet. </li></ol><br>  All together - the components of the success of a friendly and promising service. <br><br>  <b>Disclaimer</b> This is not a technical project or concept, this is a recorded idea.  Ideas, concepts and their implementation are my work, but sometimes I just practice practicing something new, it's a bit of a hobby for me.  I put it here to discuss with other habrovchanami, including those who are more experienced and smarter than me - what is wrong, what should be corrected and improved, and most importantly - whether it has the right to life. <br><br><habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/70520/">https://habr.com/ru/post/70520/</a></p>
