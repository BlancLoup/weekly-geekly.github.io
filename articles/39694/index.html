  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Future CPU, Intel Development Cards</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  As you know, it is human nature to plan your future.  But if the plans of people usually concern their local environment, then the largest hardware / software companies manipulate half the planet.  It is not surprising that they clearly monitor their plans and keep them in the strictest secret from competitors. <br><br>  And when ‚Äúgenealogical maps‚Äù of Intel processors get into the network, official or not, <b>there</b> is <b>always</b> a risk of being wrong, but, with the same probability, you can be on a horse.  One can check these kinds of guesses in only one way - entrenchment;  just give time to quietly flow and follow the events.  And depending on what we know, it is possible with a certain degree of confidence to assert about the authenticity of the images ‚Äúleaked‚Äù to the Internet.  Just keep in mind that any plans can change at high speed and what I suggest you look at now most likely reflects Intel‚Äôs <i>current</i> plans for 2008-2010, but the company always has the right to change its position. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/124725/Pics/Fullfulls.png"><br>  Image of the original size: <a href="">here</a> . <br><br>  These diagrams were published by Japanese <a href="http://pc.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/2008/0904/kaigai464.htm%26sa%3DX%26oi%3Dtranslate%26resnum%3D1%26ct%3Dresult">PCWatch</a> and, today, they reflect the real situation on the processor market.  But until Intel says that these are official circuits - they are <i>unofficial</i> .

      But today, Intel actually, as shown on the card, fills the market with key chips for itself: E7300 (2.6GHz Wolfdale, 3MB L2).  Moving into the 4th quarter of the current year, we see the launch of Nehalem (although initially only Bloomfield and the lower position in the group of Mainstream 3, which should hint at the price).  Leaving the key release of the Core i7 in his pocket, and moving to mid-2009, Intel updates almost the entire line of processors on Nehalem, ‚Äúshifting‚Äù the current Core 2 Duo to the low-end class: Celeron.  And at the bottom we see new Atoms. <br><br>  Turning our eyes to 2010, we are facing the six-core Westmere (which is currently scheduled for release in the first half of the year) in the high-end market sector.  It seems that Intel can not wait to push through, but in another way it can not be called, in the mass market multicore processors, despite the actual death of applications that would support 6 and 8 stones. <br><br>  But this problem is no longer new, but one far-reaching conclusion can be made: perhaps one of the strongest performance jumps awaits us (although, according to Moore's law, we will call the ‚Äústrongest‚Äù every 4‚Äì5 year CPU performance gap). <br><br><h4>  Atom in 2009 </h4><br><img src="http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/124725/Pics/Atom.jpg"><br><br>  There are no specific dates on this map, but there is no need to be a visionary either.  Atom 230 now occupies a rather active and sought-after position in the market, and the launch of 330 is a matter of a few weeks.  New mobile processors should appear in 2009, but at the moment it is unclear whether Intel will repeat last year‚Äôs trick and release single-core processors in front of dual-core ones.  The two biggest changes that may come are the change of platform and the integrated core of the GPU.  And it is not at all necessary that the graphics chip will be integrated into each Atom processor, Intel may well set it as an option for an additional price. <br><br>  The fact that the new Atom will use DMI instead of the standard FSB indicates the presence of a built-in memory controller (the cherished letters DDR2 x1), and this suggests that the performance of mobile solutions based on Intel will also rise significantly.  At the same time, if the processor has RAM, then the company will most likely use MCM stamping for Pinefield: CPU + IMC on one side and GPU core on the other. <br><br>  All this, however, was already expected without any spy charts and maps.  Atom has been pointed out by Intel itself for quite a long time (there is also the problem of the voracious 945GC chipset, which consumes much more power than the processor itself).  And if Atom's with 1.8 GHz and 2 GHz performance surprise me a little, then the dual-core Atom 2 GHz will probably be the 2009 mobile nail. <br><br>  PS Dear friends, as you know - I never publish something that I myself cannot be sure of at least 50%.  So it was with the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/apple/38707/">iPod 4G</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/gadgets/38717/">HTC Dream</a> and ... in general, with just what it was (and I remember only <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/lenta/27787/">one exception</a> ).  And this is not to mention the fact that I love the same as yours.  A brief reference to the issue of rumors, speculation and fakes.  And no need to holivarit, I ask you - this is information for discussion, and not splashes of saliva. <br><br>  In the wake of <a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20080905-the-cpus-of-the-future-alleged-intel-roadmaps-leaked.html">Ars technica</a> . <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/39694/">https://habr.com/ru/post/39694/</a></p>
