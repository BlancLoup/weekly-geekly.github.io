  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Tesla dramatically increases the production of electric vehicles</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/106/055/284/1060552847599093c78b4a7a624d5e7b.jpg"><br><br>  Tesla, it seems, is going to not only fulfill its promises to produce thousands of electric vehicles per week, it is also capable of exceeding the plan.  Recently, company representatives <a href="https://electrek.co/2019/07/11/tesla-supplier-hints-massive-model-3-production-increase/">announced the expansion of production at a factory in Fremont, California</a> .  By the end of the quarter, the company plans to start producing about 1,000 electric vehicles per day. <br><br>  This thousand includes 797 pieces. Model 3, 160 - Model S, all the rest - Model X electric cars. Now the company has dramatically increased the capacity of the factory and is not going to stop there. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Tesla employees recently received emails from management, which state that the company is preparing to increase the production of electric vehicles.  Unfortunately, the details were not specified, but the head of the company said that everyone would be surprised by the result.

      In addition, the message was given a positive assessment of the work of employees.  In particular, the letter refers to the "achievement of new heights in the volume of production, while maintaining the quality."  Employees are urged to raise the bar for quality even higher. <br><br>  Earlier, Ilon Musk said that already this year the company is going to produce 7000 Model 3 per week at a factory in Fremont and more than 3000 at a factory in China (this is the ‚ÄúGiga factory 3‚Äù). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c63/49d/9d4/c6349d9d47f12a476171a0852eaf3255.jpg"><br><br>  Experts believe that the upcoming changes are an increase in the production volumes of luxury models, while maintaining the production volume of the base Model 3 at a level of 7,000 electric vehicles per week. <br><br>  Tesla plans are confirmed by the <a href="https://electrek.co/2019/07/09/tesla-mysterious-production-capacity-increase/">actions of the Chinese partners</a> .  The local factory is also expanding.  Chinese media have received information that local production increases the monthly shipment of parts for Tesla Model 3 from 20 thousand to 40 thousand. <br><br>  Earlier it was reported that in addition to the growth in the production of electric vehicles, Tesla is going to give some surprises to its fans - both existing and potential buyers.  In particular, the company is going to upgrade Tesla Model S and Model X. In addition, Tesla is switching to the production of its own batteries, which will give it the opportunity to reduce the cost of production of machines, as well as to increase the energy density of batteries.  As a result, autonomous operation of electric vehicles can be increased.  To all this, you need to add the release of a freight electric car, most likely it will be a pickup truck, not a tractor.  Buyers will receive an updated insurance program. <br><br>  Just a few months ago, Tesla had major problems, both with finances and with the relationship with legislators (at least in the US).  As far as one can understand, the company is gradually leaving the ‚Äúblack line‚Äù.  Of course, it is difficult to predict the future of Tesla in the current environment, but I would like to hope that everything will be fine. <br><br><hr><br> <a href="http://madrobots.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26amp%3Butm_medium%3Dpr%26amp%3Butm_campaign%3Dtessl"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d29/4c3/07d/d294c307dde04335ac3f425e73b36a7a.gif"></a> <br> <a href="http://madrobots.ru/about/mails/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26amp%3Butm_medium%3Dpr%26amp%3Butm_campaign%3Dtessl"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7fa/417/fe3/7fa417fe3d464fa5aa186b1ab30da53a.gif"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/459767/">https://habr.com/ru/post/459767/</a></p>
