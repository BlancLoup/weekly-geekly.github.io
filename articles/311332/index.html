We share our opinions about the program, reports and the general atmosphere on Droidcon and call the community for discussion.  We hope that an open discussion of the conference will contribute to its improvement in the future. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7c4/deb/c4c/7c4debc4cbda46cd98c15c0efa26883b.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/030/efd/002/030efd00236148ddaabfcb6884bf7012.png" alt="image" align="left">  <b>Artem Kulakov ( <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/fi5t/" class="user_link">Fi5t</a> )</b> <br>  <i>‚ÄúDroidcon this year turned out to be very mediocre.</i>  <i>There were very few interesting reports, and some were completely marketing.</i>  <i>The topic of testing was not touched on at all, although, as I believe, this is not the strongest side of Android development at the moment and good, I really would like to see practical reports on this topic at the event of this level.</i>  <i>Moreover, Google is investing considerable resources in the development of testing.</i> <i>

    </i>  <i>A separate item is the organization of the event.</i>  <i>It is evident that the organizers tried, but it turned out to be very faded.</i>  <i>Entertainment, contests, stands with interesting developments, where is all this?</i>  <i>All these seemingly useless things greatly contribute to networking, for which, in fact, it is worth going to conferences.</i>  <i>As a result: listened to a number of reports (almost without a break), ate, listened to a number of reports and went home.</i>  <i>All this was somewhat brightened by the afterparty, but there were only 30 people there, and most of the participants did not have this impression either. ‚Äù</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1df/993/e4b/1df993e4be34483c94a5419fc8414db7.png" alt="image" align="left">  <b>Vladislav Shipugin</b> <br>  <i>‚ÄúThe conference is a place where you can communicate with colleagues, share experiences.</i>  <i>When a half hour is allocated for a report, it is very difficult to talk about something, and the absence of interruptions did not allow discussing the reports and communicating normally.</i>  <i>Hardcore reports were not.</i>  <i>The conference covered topics such as the new Android, mobile application architecture and firebase.</i>  <i>Because of the backlog in the second hall, there was a shift in the reports, and I missed an interesting report about Unsafe, I‚Äôll probably have to watch the video.</i>  <i>It was my first Droidcon, and yet it was great.</i>  <i>It's nice when there are a lot of people around who understand how difficult it is to write Samsung code. ‚Äù</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/288/948/246/288948246dab480e8aa31a118cd3450a.png" alt="image" align="left">  <b>Alexander Blinov ( <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/xanderblinov/" class="user_link">Xanderblinov</a> )</b> <br>  <i>‚ÄúThe last Moscow Droidcon was dedicated to application architecture.</i>  <i>It was on him that my friend and I had the idea to write an MVP library that would solve all the problems that had been voiced, and this year we presented our MVP solution to Moxy at the largest Android conference in Russia.</i>  <i>I hope it will be useful for the community.</i>  <i>In general, the level of the Moscow Droidcon has dropped - this was reflected in the qualifications and training of speakers, as well as a decrease in the number of hardcore reports and foreign speakers.</i>  <i>There were really interesting topics such as MVVM and Unsafe.</i>  <i>I hope next year there will be more such reports. ‚Äù</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/188/448/9bf/1884489bfa654875ac28d5be1daac165.png" alt="image" align="left">  <b>Sergey Zarochentsev</b> <br>  <i>‚ÄúIt is a pity that Droidcon was only one day, and that one was working.</i>  <i>Moscow Droidcon, alas, is still inferior to New York and Berlin in terms of reports.</i>  <i>This year, as in the past, a lot of attention was paid to architecture: if there was already a lot of talk about MVP, then the approach from ViewModel is new.</i>  <i>I wonder if Google will bring its Data Binding to mind or not?</i>  <i>It was interesting to hear about the new, trendy Firebase.</i>  <i>Here there were as many as three reports about him.</i>  <i>It is worth noting also the report about sun.misc.Unsafe.</i>  <i>It's funny that hardcore stuff from big Java began to penetrate Android development.</i>  <i>Also interesting were the reports of Denis Neklyudov about Android Nougat (which did not bring any radical changes) and Alexander Smirnov about UI.</i>  <i>However, I‚Äôm surprised at the lack of topics related to Rx, Kotlin and testing on Droidcon. ‚Äù</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c7e/214/20e/c7e21420e08948cb8748d5a6aa908c09.png" alt="image" align="left">  <b>Ilya Shulgin</b> <br>  <i>‚ÄúThe Moscow Droidcon 2016, which was so long awaited by the entire Russian-speaking Android community, has flown by so far. It flew, not passed - this year the conference lasted only one day.</i>  <i>Grieved that in general did not affect Kotlin, who is now experiencing the peak of his glory.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>The rest of the conference met the expectations - the new Nugi chips are laid out on the shelves, Firebase is well lit, there were a number of reports on VR and IoT.</i>  <i>The speakers dismantled interesting cases on automation, the architecture was also not spared.</i>  <i>Many thanks to the authors of the reports and the organizers for holding the conference!</i>  <i>I really hope that the next Droidcon will be even more saturated with interesting performances! ‚Äù</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c1a/057/c1d/c1a057c1d26e4ee88a88621f3d3f0396.png" alt="image" align="left">  <b>Alexander Mikhalevich</b> <br>  <i>‚ÄúUnfortunately, the number of reports and their average level turned out to be lower than last year.</i>  <i>Especially unpleasantly surprised by the level of organization of the conference.</i>  <i>The first report was delayed for 20 minutes, and then also accompanied by technical problems.</i>  <i>Subsequently, the time for a break between reports was reduced to five minutes, and then completely disappeared, switching the event to non-stop.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>The beginning of the day, according to tradition, was asked by Denis Neklyudov with his report on Android Nougat.</i>  <i>A very interesting was the report from the creator of the Moxy library - Yuri Shmakov.</i>  <i>This library stands out for its mechanism of interaction between the model and the presentation in the MVP pattern, which allows not to think about the life cycles of Android components.</i>  <i>Daniel Serdyukov motivated his report to get acquainted with the pattern of MVVM.</i>  <i>And the only hardcore report was from Alexander Efremenkov.</i>  <i>Alexander told how to allocate and use memory using the sun.misc.Unsafe class.</i>  <i>At the end of the day, Alexander Smirnov sent everyone to the path of a true UI-samurai. ‚Äù</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2f2/440/4e8/2f24404e8aeb49fc90ee50c23cb75ad0.png" alt="image" align="left">  <b>Nikita Tregubov</b> <br>  <i>‚ÄúThe change of organizers (and venues) of the next rally of domestic adherents of the green man did not benefit anyone except cashiers.</i>  <i>I think there is not a single developer who visited the event and did not mention its extremely dull atmosphere, from unreasonably prolonged registration and shifting the entire schedule by 20 minutes, prior to the inclusion of advertising reports and even direct hunting attempts into the program.</i>  <i>From myself I would add that I managed to literally zafilit literally every step of the online registration, as a result of which I got an extra mailbox and an unpleasant aftertaste before the start of the presentations.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>As for the essence, there was some interesting information, in particular, the details of adaptation for Android N and a more or less detailed overview of the Firebase services advertised on the latest Google I / O.</i>  <i>Nothing that the interested specialist did not have time to touch in his spare time, but is useful for those who did not have this time.</i>  <i>The usefulness of the reports somewhat understated the 30-minute limit unusual for the format of a normal conference.</i>  <i>In general, the event caused a dissonance with last year‚Äôs and made us ponostalgate at mail.ru as a very good organizer. ‚Äù</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/311332/">https://habr.com/ru/post/311332/</a></p>
