We were determined with the purchase budget, paid attention to the design, the size of the address book and the choice is almost complete.  But times are changing and the time when the lineup of even the largest companies consisted of a heel of a dozen devices, and their appearance and functionality could be judged on the basis of the alphanumeric model index.  For example: take Siemens.  A-class - state employees, C - middle class, S - business ... Here, in principle, everything is one letter and one number, meaning the series of the device and the choice is complete. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  However, after some time, with the advent of new features such as built-in cameras, MP3 players and so on, the ability to form your model line from a small number of models has disappeared - the market needed as many different devices as possible, which would be positioned quite differently , would be intended for different social groups and would differ both in design elements and filling.  Naturally, in addition to the colossal work on the introduction and debugging of new technologies and platforms, vendors had to ‚Äúconfuse‚Äù with indexes of the designation of new handsets: after all, creating a new product is one thing, but correctly communicating it to the user and ensuring that he does not get confused a wide and demarcated model line is another matter. <br><br>  So, according to the quality level of the designation of the model range and the ease of orientation in it, the company can be divided into two types: a) everything is clear and b) nothing is clear, everything is very confusing and strange.  We will deal with each well-known vendor and make a conclusion about the attitude of marketers to their potential ‚Äúvictims‚Äù - simple, not friendly with specialized literature and the Internet, buyers.

    <h3>  Nokia </h3><br><br><img height="222" hspace="10" vspace="10" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c87/dca/0fd/c87dca0fd50b0413db6ef496e3526240.jpg" width="100" align="left">  Indexing models of the Finnish manufacturer has a long and well-established tradition - in principle, problems with perception should not arise.  Devices of the 1xxx (1100, 1110) and 2xxx (2610, 2652) series are inexpensive budget ‚Äúdialers‚Äù designed for unpretentious customers who want to pay less, but at the same time ‚Äútear off‚Äù their own respected brand.  If before the difference between the 1st and 2nd series was not noticeable, now it is clearly expressed - newer 2xxx, as a rule, are equipped with simple color screens.  3xxx (3100, 3220) - solutions of the age-old youth, which was manifested both in the design and in a somewhat simplified, in comparison with the same 6th series, functionality.  Why in past tense?  Because Nokia hasn‚Äôt presented any novelties of the 3rd series for quite a long time ... For some reason, the 4th series has always been ignored - there is no such thing and there wasn‚Äôt any, but 5xxx (5140i, 5500) are dust and moisture-proof solutions for outdoor activities, sports also for young people - the models 5200 and 5300 eloquently speak about this; they have quite ordinary housings in terms of their strength.  Apparently, the 3rd and 5th series are now one.  The Sixes (6630, 6233) are very rigorous business models;  ‚ÄúSevens‚Äù (7270, 7360) - image solutions of unique design and execution.  It often happens that the 6th and 7th series devices differ only in the design of the case - this was the case, for example, with a pair of 7610/6670.  Naturally, the first cost more - image!  8xxx (8910i, 8800) - expensive devices, suitable for both shocking a poor public, and for business, intended for very wealthy buyers.  And, finally, 9xxx (9500, 9300i) - folding communicators, when folded, are very large cell phones, and in the open - small laptops.  N-Gage - game consoles, however, the story of "gag" in their current form, apparently, has already been completed. <br><br>  The second and third digits of the Nokia model index do not carry any secret meaning, but the fourth one is more complicated: the number 1, for example, indicates a modification or an updated version of the same device with a minimum of differences;  the same situation with the letter "i".  For example, 1100/1101 or 6680/6681, 6230 / 6230i.  There are also letter series: E-series for corporate use and N-series, which are multimedia combines.  If at the end of the index is the figure 0, then the model was planned by the developers as the ‚Äúhit of the season‚Äù, and the calculation was made on its mass character and popularity. <br><br><h3>  Sony ericcson </h3><br><br><img height="181" hspace="10" vspace="10" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d5d/aa5/761/d5daa576113e35cda07b28695923f77b.jpg" width="100" align="left">  The Japanese-Swedish manufacturer indexes its devices, first of all, by letter ‚Äúclasses‚Äù, and inside them - by numbers: the higher the number, the steeper and the newer the model.  With the W-series, the situation is separate - these devices, as a rule, are similar to ‚Äúcivilian‚Äù models, but they may have a lower digital index than the analog.  A typical example is the Z530i and the W300i.  The letter ‚Äúi‚Äù in the case of SE means only the region for which the device is intended: ‚Äúi‚Äù - Europe, ‚Äúc‚Äù - China, ‚Äúa‚Äù - USA. <br><br>  J-class (J220i, J300i) - entry-level models, characterized by average characteristics and are not, as a rule, the strongest products of the company in comparison with competitors.  The K-series devices are the most massive, powerful and, so to speak, ‚Äúshock‚Äù, because it was thanks to this series that the SE gained a second wind and its current popularity - it all started with a couple of K500i / K700i, then K750i, and now K790i / K800i.  The letter W denotes the Walkman brand (W800i, W710i), namely, musical models, where the emphasis is primarily on the convenience of the player and sound quality.  By analogy with the Walkman, the CyberShot sub-brand is also introduced (SE CyberShot K800i, for example), although this word is only added to the letter and index number of the model, and does not replace the letter. <br><br>  P-series (P900i, P990i) - business-class smartphones based on Symbian OS and UIQ interface, M-series (M600i) - the same, but in a simplified form and with more pleasant price tags.  Z-series - folding beds, most of them functionally similar to monoblocks. <br><br><h3>  BenQ-Siemens </h3><br><br><img height="181" hspace="10" vspace="10" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f2b/de1/4fd/f2bde14fd9dcaecb0fe26b8e4b1e3365.jpg" width="100" align="left">  Here everything is very, very neglected.  Previously, the indexes of Siemens models were clear and understandable, differing in letters (device classes) and numbers (the number 5 at the end is a generation, for example, the 75th series; 0 - transitional models, for example CX70).  The letter G in the index was previously planned to call models with WCDMA support (SXG75 or never released SG75).  Now, probably, there will be no more episodes, and the higher the first digit - the more serious the model.  But the letter indices very often have no special significance: for example, the S-class apparatus (S68) is functionally weaker than the C-class apparatus (C81).  So it turns out that, in fact, we have a very vague model range with music models that are not highlighted, for example (EF51, EF71; there is only the not-always-used name Q-Fi).  Emki (M81) and em-eshki (ME75) are also designed for off-road operation;  A (A31) now means a budget monoblock;  AL (AL55) - slider;  AF (AF51) - clamshell.  E-series, apparently, consists solely of monoblocks, EF - folding beds and (sometimes) sliders.  The CL and CF classes currently consist of one model each;  SL-class - from two: SL80 (SL75 in a pink case) and the announced SL91.  As you can see, even here the devil would break his leg, and to determine the class and model form factor by ear is very problematic now. <br><br><h3>  Samsung </h3><br><br><img height="174" hspace="10" vspace="10" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e29/7f1/6ca/e297f16caa07931e9ff207075b70fc7c.jpg" width="100" align="left">  The Koreans are also a bit confused, but, unlike BenQ-Siemens, some logic is still visible.  The most interesting classes of products are D and E, they include business models in the slider form factor (D600, D800), expensive fashion models (D830, E900, E910 Serene), as well as the most technological devices (D900).  This also includes image models simpler (E500, E730).  Z-series models are designed to work in 3G networks;  The i-series is smartphones and communicators, but smartphones for work in third-generation networks sometimes carry the Z index (Z600), and the first S60-smarts use the D index (D720, D730).  The P series today is represented by flat-calculator phones belonging to the business class - P300 and P310.  The X-series is a youth budget, consisting of both clamshells and inexpensive monoblocks.  The expensive ‚Äúclassic‚Äù, however, also carries the letter X - X700, X820. <br>  The role is played only by the first digit of the numerical index.  Naturally, the higher it is, the more serious the apparatus.  But there are exceptions: the E530 and E720 / E730, despite the significantly different numerical indices, are made on the same platform and are analogues. <br><br><h3>  Motorola </h3><br><br><img height="177" hspace="10" vspace="10" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/373/829/026/37382902621f300b6f0346ba7552ebb7.gif" width="100" align="left">  It seems that in the middle and upper classes the Americans finally ‚Äútied up‚Äù to call models only an alphanumeric index: now they also add to it an abbreviation of the word with which users are ‚Äúadvised‚Äù to associate the model: RAZR, PEBL, ROKR, etc. This is respectively, thin, streamlined and music phones.  With these names, indices of the same letter and numbers coexist, for example, V3, U6, L7.  Sometimes there is a third letter - V3i or V3x, which means an improved, updated version of the model.  The C-series (budget models) and the W-series (W208, W375) that appeared not so long ago are present in the middle and low-end segments - something that is not low-budget, but also not very expensive.  Smartphones used to carry the MPX index (MPX220), but now the newest communicator is called Q. <br><br>  It should be noted that the situation is described only in the European market - Motorola has a mass of product lines for different markets, models differ in appearance, functionality and, of course, the name. <br><br><h3>  LG </h3><br><br><img height="186" hspace="10" vspace="10" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2a3/2ca/83d/2a32ca83dc5c95572ca2d63329e93c7c.jpg" width="100" align="left">  Another South Korean company is currently in a state of complete renewal or even, rather, the formation of a new model range for European markets.  The KGxxx and KExxx indices are already used, and there is no particular division into classes - the KG combination of letters denotes both the high-tech KG920 cameraphone, and the exclusively fashionable KG800 / KG810, and entry-level models such as KG210.  Previous generation devices: P7200 (thin clamshell);  C- and B-series, representing a wide range of budget decisions.  The purpose of the M-series is generally not clear - there are both ‚Äúphono mobiles‚Äù (M4410) and completely different ones, positioning as musical, products (M6100).  In general, there is no slender lineup here - a scattered group, albeit interesting, but devoid of a common product philosophy.  We hope that the new line will be contained in a greater order. <br><br><h3>  Philips </h3><br><br><img height="200" hspace="10" vspace="10" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3a5/7bb/151/3a57bb151ddb3f80d70f59dfe60aa781.gif" width="143" align="left">  The Dutch are extremely simple and clear: the higher the digital index, the more interesting the model, starting with the first series and ending with the ninth.  So, the 162nd model is budget, the 768th is a good middle class, and the 960th is a top-end solution with a 2 megapixel camera.  If the name of the model contains the word Xenium, then know that this unit can work without recharging for up to two weeks. <br><br>  As you can see, it is not difficult to get lost in the modern variety of devices and their directions.  Vendors invent new series, new functional features and even new form factors - all this forces us to expand the model series and supplement the model names with letters, numbers and words ... It seems that this is not so bad - it is better to spend the extra 15 minutes to study the updated indexing, so that later it will be much faster and more accurate to understand what can be expected from a new mobile friend. <br><br>  Manufacturers, according to rumors, care, first of all, about us. <br><br>  Source: <a href="http://www.terralab.ru/mobilis/298702/">Terralab</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/1229/">https://habr.com/ru/post/1229/</a></p>
