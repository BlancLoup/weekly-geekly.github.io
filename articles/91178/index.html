  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Are there people on Habr√© with their opinions?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Surely, many people this morning managed to read a <a href="http://malyshev.habrahabr.ru/blog/91160">topic about an evil spammer</a> who extorted money under the threat of closing the site / service of the victim.  Let us leave aside the obvious scam and simplicity of the text of the letters, let's better consider how typical Hab users are responding in such situations. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  So, the topic is published.  Without going inside the topic, you can see the suspicious header (‚ÄúScammers on Habr√©‚Äù) and the unequivocal mention of the name of Habrapomer, accused of sending spam.  And for the convenience of <strike>minus the</strike> login was in the form of a link - so it is more convenient.  What are the first steps?  That's right - to punish the villain!  It‚Äôs stupid to spend Friday time reading topics, but we don‚Äôt like spammers. <br><br>  Of course, the curious part looked inside and read the message.  Among them was me.  Naturally, the majority of local inhabitants never lead to such nonsense, so the initial purpose of publishing this letter (that is, a warning) does not make sense - people gathered in the know.  This topic is different from most similar to the fact that in the body of spam messages there was a mention of a recent history with fake vacancies and its author, habra- <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/frichx/" class="user_link">user frichx</a> .  Now, on his behalf sent letters with threats.

        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

      <br>
      Immediately after reading the topic, I opened the <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/frichx/" class="user_link">frichx</a> profile and spotted his karma.  It is obvious that the burning desire to "omit" the criminal, users began to reap the appropriate arrow.  My appeals to think about the situation did not lead to anything good.  Moreover, I received in response the opinion that ‚Äúthis user must prove his innocence‚Äù!  And then they sent comments like ‚ÄúI have to punish him,‚Äù ‚Äúcan I bring him to criminal responsibility‚Äù ... <br><br>  People, well, is it really hard to think with your head?  Read what he published <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/frichx/" class="user_link">frichx</a> , his LJ, etc.  After all, a completely adequate person who woke up this morning and saw how the karma of +8 became -5.  The author of the ‚Äúrevealing‚Äù topic of course wrote an update calling for the minus to stop, but the update is located below.  It is not visible from the outside of the topic, and not all the ministers read to the end. <br><br><h4>  Not so scary </h4><br>  A couple of hours (!!) after the publication, the first comments appeared with doubts about the involvement of <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/frichx/" class="user_link">frichx</a> in this situation.  Soon there was a long-awaited <a href="http://malyshev.habrahabr.ru/blog/91160/">comment from the</a> victim of this newsletter.  Naturally, he is not guilty of anything and did not know about anything. <br><br>  This example is not unique.  Look at almost any news with a bright yellow headline, which has been quite a lot lately (about restricting rights on the Internet, about training, hidden cameras, etc.).  Always first comes the influx of angry screams "yes they are fucking great!", "Insanity!", Etc.  And only then calm and weighted arguments appear, links to sources of information, and as a result it turns out that nothing terrible, the news has passed on the damaged telephone, or the author has overdone it, etc. <br><br><h4>  What's next? </h4><br>  And nothing.  Keep reading the topics ‚ÄúI have my own opinion‚Äù, ‚Äúhow not to get under the control of the crowd‚Äù and believe that everything is all right with you.  Try to think about what you read, watch the sources.  Do not give in to provocations. <br><br>  Separate appeal - to the author of that topic, <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/malyshev/" class="user_link">malyshev</a> : do not throw accusations, it is in our time is fraught with unpredictable consequences, for which then it will be a shame. <br><br>  And return the karma to <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/frichx/" class="user_link">frichx</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/91178/">https://habr.com/ru/post/91178/</a></p>
