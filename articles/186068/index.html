  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How we bought a BlackBerry Curve 9220 smartphone</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> I never considered myself a fan of BlackBerry, moreover, the smartphones of this company (for some time it is called that, and not RIM) came to me extremely rarely and not for long - so I turned it over in my hands, shrugged my shoulders and returned it to the immediate owner.  A couple of months ago, my friend decided to get a "Blackberry" - and certainly the official one, with Cyrillic on the keys.  BlackBerry smartphones in Ukraine only sell MTS, and a friend has a completely different operator - so there was no talk of connecting the same BIS, the device was planned to be used with another SIM card.  In general, the purpose of the purchase is still unclear ... You know how it sometimes happens - a person wakes up in the morning and thinks: I want a BlackBerry (iPhone, Xbox, Lamborghini, a new refrigerator, make a coming-out - underline), goes and buys.  Here, apparently, about the same situation. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/aa2/4b4/f4d/aa24b4f4dac12d7e3813ae40317e48d7.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Since within a couple of weeks from the date of purchase of the BlackBerry Curve 9220 - and we took it, our friend got fed up with the smartphone, I bought the device into the collection at a very reasonable price.  I want to talk about some of the nuances of the operation of this model, but first of all - a couple of words about the acquisition process, since I was present at it. <br><br>  The pretty consulting girl in the MTS salon was probably very surprised by the fact that someone had suddenly thought about buying a BlackBerry smartphone.  The girl, after hearing the request to show us the device, and then sell it, glanced at the Nokia Asha phone with the QWERTY-keyboard on the next showcase, and said something like: ‚ÄúBoys, can you take it better?  See - how cute, green, and cheaper. "  Indeed, with the colors of the BlackBerry Curve 9220 everything is really not easy - in Ukraine, only the black version is offered.  In nature, according to the Internet, there are also white, red, blue and dark turquoise versions. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2b8/432/920/2b84329200e266303d15230ba90ea660.jpg"><br><br>  With the price, too, the situation is strange.  It is clear that the BlackBerry Curve 9220 is a smartphone, and even from a relatively prestigious brand, and yet ... They ask for something about 1,700 hryvnia, that is, more than 200 dollars.  For this money, you can buy quite a modern smartphone on Android, and on Windows Phone too.  It would be better to remain silent about the aforementioned ‚ÄúAshe‚Äù for the steward, but nevertheless, BlackBerry smartphones are offering MTS, and for some reason there were no brochures on their features and advantages.  Consultants about them (about smartphones) also do not know anything.  For some reason, there were no offers to connect BIS from them.  Who is to blame for this - ‚ÄúMTS‚Äù or the BlackBerry company, which breathes its hand today, I don‚Äôt know.

      In 99% of cases, the average buyer ‚Äúkettle‚Äù will be bought by Nokia, since the products look the same (I mean only sizes, no touch screen and QWERTY-keyboard), and the Finnish device costs two times less.  Business in Russian (well, or in Ukrainian)?  Apparently, yes.  Serious people who are aimed specifically at buying BlackBerry probably don‚Äôt take them from MTS - in fact, there are five girls in the operator‚Äôs cabin, and it was obvious that they sell a smartphone of this brand, if not for the first time, so second.  (This is a half-million city in which BlackBerry smartphones are available only in one MTS salon.) <br><br>  This is also evidenced by the fact that the warranty card for the BlackBerry in the box does not lie, it must be found on the internal server, printed and filled out.  So the girls did not know where to look for him, and asked to wait for some employee named Kohl, who went out to smoke.  Came out - and disappeared from the ends.  As a result, the girls called somewhere, found out something and eventually printed out this unfortunate guarantor.  Hooray. <br><br>  Saying ‚ÄúHurray!‚Äù After <b>more than a month of operation of the</b> BlackBerry Curve 9220, I probably can not.  It is clear that for full-fledged work with any BlackBerry smartphone, it is worthwhile to connect BIS to the operator, and I also have no ‚ÄúMTS‚Äù, so I did not manage to enjoy the harmonious ecosystem.  Nevertheless, set up mail, VKontakte messenger (badly crooked - for example, in most cases it does not want to automatically upload new messages), browser (including Opera Mini) and access to the BlackBerry App World store (from there, VKontakte messenger was downloaded and "Opera") is possible without BIS, for this there are a number of popular methods - welcome to Google or Yandex.  At the same time, the official pre-installed Twitter and Facebook clients did not work. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9ed/727/537/9ed72753737b5b71ca3320ff2e3eb2ad.jpg"><br><br>  It looks like the <b>interface</b> BlackBerry OS 7.1 - it is under the control of this system that the Curve 9220 works - very unusual.  Well, let's say, if you have been sitting on the iPhone or Android for several years now, the menu of this smartphone will throw you back into the past - in times of crooked icons, strange design moves, and so on.  But, in general, you can get used to the interface - my addiction process took only a couple of days.  From the unusual, I would note the need to reboot the smartphone after installing application updates (!) And a very long power up - if you get the battery, put it in place and press the power button, it will take about two minutes. <br><br>  With regard to <b>ergonomics</b> and <b>iron</b> , it is clear that BlackBerry has enough company developments, although all of them, alas, in 2013 are practically not applicable in practice and are not particularly needed by anyone.  For example, I have dealt with QWERTY smartphones more than once, but I could not type text on them: my fingers turned out to be incompatible with keyboards at the hardware level :).  But on the BlackBerry Curve 9220 with its small buttons, I can type long letters, since the shape of these buttons is very, very convenient.  One more thing: if I pick up a phone or a smartphone without a touch screen, then after a couple of minutes wandering around the menu, I automatically start poking at the display - trying to press virtual buttons.  Here I have never clicked on the screen: navigation through the interface is carried out using an optical joystick, which, again, is very convenient.  True, alas, in our time - the time of touchscreens, similar controls, as well as the QWERTY-keyboard, are on the dustbin of history. <br><br>  Not without <b>marriage</b> .  On the right side of the smartphone there is a key to which you can assign the launch of an application.  So she refused to work - all other buttons have a clear course and work like a clock, but this one is not.  Here it is worth saying that the side panels of the BlackBerry Curve 9220 are trimmed with rubber, on which bulges are provided for buttons on the board.  Probably, at the factory, the button on the board did not get into the seat intended for it on an elastic band.  Solved the problem like this: removed the back cover, pulled the gum off with a fingernail (risking tearing it up or simply damaging it) and ‚Äúshaking‚Äù from side to side.  As a result, after an hour of torment, the button earned. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/288/612/6ab/2886126ab7c64af548c85043e6fb801c.jpg"><br>  The same button that managed to get to work <br><br>  The back panel is made of glossy plastic.  She sits well, like a glove, but she collects scratches just terribly quickly.  Meanwhile, the covers for this device in Ukraine during the day with fire you will not find. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/199/a67/184/199a67184b3126f8f08581dc81c4ea54.jpg"><br>  Fragment of the back with scratches <br><br>  But the BlackBerry Curve 9220 is very small.  Perhaps this device should be recommended to users who would not like to take a brick-class smartphone with them on vacation, but they don‚Äôt agree with an ordinary mobile phone with an old-fashioned email client.  Here are the sizes of the BlackBerry Curve 9220 in comparison with a number of other gadgets: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e64/7e9/63d/e647e963df7e9f91f2ae465fe8f3f3b0.jpg"><br>  Samsung Keystone 2, HTC Titan, BlackBerry Curve 9220 <br><br>  2.4-inch <b>screen</b> with a resolution of 320 x 240 pixels for obvious reasons did not cause much enthusiasm - well, the screen and the screen, moderately grainy, moderately bright.  Approximately like that Nokia Asha for $ 100, or even worse. <br><br>  What I liked was the sound of the external speaker.  I can not even believe that such a small device can yell so loud and clean.  Well, directly HTC One to you or OPPO Find 5. In headphones, the sound, in my inexperienced look, is also quite good.  By the way, I found this picture on the Internet - see below. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2f4/a6a/d18/2f4a6ad18f7e3ba529bc853331f4533d.jpg"><br><br>  Maybe in some countries, the BlackBerry Curve 9220 comes with these headphones, but I personally found something that was cheap and terrible in the box: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1fd/105/064/1fd1050647db74c1806b42b1603dd661.jpg"><br><br>  There is no GPS receiver and 3G network support in the BlackBerry Curve 9220 - this model is generally intended for developing countries, including, for example, India.  The camera - well, it seems to be here ... 2 megapixels, autofocus and flash are absent - that says it all.  A couple of examples of the photo below: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f02/3b8/85b/f023b885b82f9614f22a20e0af348e08.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/684/8ba/050/6848ba050f48c12aa2052a9182b65e67.jpg"><br><br>  It is believed that BlackBerry smartphones have an excellent autonomy - for them, supposedly, three and four days are not a problem.  The BlackBerry Curve 9220 is not like this: a 1,450 mAh battery gives it a day and a half of work.  Although there seems to be nothing to eat its charge - the screen is small, there is no 3G, the processor is weak (one core, 800 MHz). <br><br>  In general, no, more than $ 200 this miracle is clearly not worth it, and in Ukraine (and not only here) I don‚Äôt see the audience for this model at all.  The device, as described above, turned out to be expensive and at the same time imperfect.  I, in principle, am satisfied - the collection has been replenished with one more instance.  Which, however, is difficult to use :). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/186068/">https://habr.com/ru/post/186068/</a></p>
