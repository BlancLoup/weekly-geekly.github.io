  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Internet technology excellence or one life offline - a look from the past</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The reader of this modest historical story is offered not as it usually happens - to plunge into the past, but only to take a closer look at the real present (pun). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Last night I went home and looked at the stars: Jupiter was just above my head and I remembered that I had a telescope hidden in a deep-lined ages in my closet.  I came home, went to the site <a href="http://universe-calc.ru/">universe-calc.ru</a> , indicated my location on a Google map and received for my locality a calendar of astronomical phenomena for the coming year: from flashes of iridiums to solar eclipses.  It turned out that this year there will be 22 coverings of the planets by the Moon and none of them will be visible in the European part of Russia, and on October 8 the Moon will close Uranus, being in total eclipse, an article on this site has already been written with the instruction that what is the easiest way to get to the place of observation, and about the organization of a tourist trip.  But what will happen on August 18 will be able to see everything - the rarest convergence of Jupiter, Venus and the M44 star cluster, when the planets are located at a distance less than half the diameter of the Moon from each other (Approx. ).  On this site, all astronomical events are ranked by importance, rarity, proximity to the observer and the power of the required telescope, more of them have articles, instructions, video reports and amateur photos.  The newest discovered asteroids, comets and flashes of supernovae enter the system on the same day, and all this allows you to plan for 5 minutes the most interesting observations for the next month - three.  I can‚Äôt imagine how else amateur astronomers could always find up-to-date information about events available to observation. <br><br>  This morning, while I was brushing my teeth, a message came to the phone, but the phone did not play a ringtone, but read it in a human voice.  Messages that come to me start to read out loud themselves, if the home WiFi access point is visible, and they do not need to be specially opened.  It said that my companion, who drives me and other guys to work, due to fewer traffic jams will arrive 10 minutes earlier than the agreed time - this forecast was made by his navigator program in the phone and sent to me automatically.  I must say that the navigator calculates the route, not only taking into account traffic jams, but, connecting with the database, takes into account all sorts of obstacles that reduce the maximum speed on different parts of the road.  The algorithm also takes into account the effect of cars equipped with navigators on the creation of traffic jams.  Therefore, all recommended routes on all devices not only minimize travel time, but also minimize traffic congestion as much as possible, and accounting for traffic lights in this database at each time point recommends optimal speed and warns you of a possible passage to yellow or red.  This time there was a traffic accident on the route 5 minutes before our journey, so the program did not have time to adjust our route so that we didn‚Äôt waste time on downtime due to the loss of the lane, but we received an offer to move to the right lane in advance. <br><br>  When I was at work, the task arose to buy another computer and I was given the task to select components for it.  This is easily done on the <a href="http://comp-calc.ru/">comp-calc.ru</a> site - there the owners of their own assembled computers contribute to the database a set of purchased components and programs, and if any problems arise and / or if their solutions are found, they describe the whole thing, tying it to their configuration.  The site engine statistically reveals the most stable causal relationships and, at the user's request, gives a prediction about the possible incompatibility of the hypothetical configuration of the hardware itself or the risk of problems with the software.  Those.  if you need to assemble a computer, then just go to this site, specify the details you have planned to buy and you will receive a diagnosis: a list of possible problems and ways to fix them.  It took me five minutes to find a reliable configuration, select a store that had all the spare parts, place an order and print out the invoice.

      Our company employs over 500 people and we have a canteen, and since  lunch time is not strictly regulated, then the queue in it can be unpredictable.  Therefore, on the corporate website there is a page with live video broadcast from the dining room, and everyone decides for himself to stand in a queue for him or wait for it to shrink.  Not enough?  So on the same site there is a vote for new dishes that can be planned, and the chefs will also cook them. <br><br>  Thanks to our developments, anyone can try a smart internet search on the website <a href="http://inet-calc.ru/">inet-calc.ru</a> , whose knowledge base only contains structured information about events, people, events, processes, scientific achievements and other information modules.  This interesting search engine, receiving a request, clarifies the context of the user, providing a choice of several options found, so as not to give out a garbage collection of everything that can be found in an infinite Internet database. <br><br>  By the way, in the topic of modern cataloging: <a href="http://sale-calc.ru/">sale-calc.ru</a> .  The site is a global catalog of all manufactured goods with all their technical and quality specifications and instructions, so you can refer to it for reliable information and not rely on unfinished promotional articles in online stores.  Manufacturers, logistics and buyers are connected to this portal, thus solving the problem of paying salaries to an excessive number of managers looking for where to buy, and managers looking for whom to sell.  Another problem has been solved - production planning, since  The main consignments of goods are made under pre-insured contracts. <br><br>  Even in the same topic - the topic of modern retail sales: there is a website <a href="http://retail-calc.ru/">retail-calc.ru</a> - there you just leave an order, you don‚Äôt even have to specifically choose the product model you want to buy - managers of various online stores and call you themselves.  It remains only to consult and bargain with them and you can even wait for a few of them to call, so that you can compare whether you were all honest and frank and offered the best price.  Delivery will be much cheaper if you agree to the courier's schedule, and the goods will be cheaper if you pre-order or choose a store that works only on pre-orders. <br><br>  Thanks to another project: <a href="http://weather-calc.ru/">weather-calc.ru</a> , an amateur meteorological network processing open data from meteorological stations and data collected by various amateur sensors, such as thunderstorms, electric field strength, surface wind, or cloud density, I received a clarifying message that approximately at 18-00, plus or minus half an hour in the place where I am, rain is expected with hail: 10 mm of precipitation will fall in an hour, and 100 mm in a day.  Such messages came to all subscribed to the newsletter, and most motorists took this into account, as a result, many drove home from work earlier than usual, calmly arrived, and this evening there were even fewer traffic jams than on a clear day. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  So what was the headline for?  - to the fact that none of this site does not exist.  As for evil - all domain names with calc at the end are free.  And all of us actually, being connected to the network, actually enjoy life offline compared to the interactive that could be today.  We use the network, filling servers' hard drives with unstructured and incoherent information in the form of forums, blogs, VKontakte walls, video clips, etc.  Against this background, only a few glimpses of systems of quick access to the necessary information of a narrow profile are noticeable.  If life gives you a real challenge, such as selecting components for a computer, then in order not to get into an ambush with minimal risk, you have to read erratic forums with reviews about a certain processor temperature, noise from a cooler and a hard disk controller that may not be supported for several days. installer operating system. <br><br>  If you think about building an elementary order in the information field, then a concept of structural, centralized information appears, like this: come, see, take and improve, add, clarify, not see - organize and put.  But apparently there is a reason why we are still in the past? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/216005/">https://habr.com/ru/post/216005/</a></p>
