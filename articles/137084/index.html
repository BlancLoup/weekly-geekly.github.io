  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Not a computer mouse and high technology</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In ancient times, the word "mouse" was interpreted unequivocally, then came the new year, other manners and now have to mark - the article is not about a computer mouse. <br><br>  Sometimes people encounter mice.  Well, if this meeting is random and fleeting, but it happens that mice like your accommodation and they start to consider it theirs, and this is not very good for both.  We have to reinvent the wheel ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Option 1. MehMag (mechanical, magnetic).</b> <br>  While serving as an officer, he rented a room in the attic in the private sector with one very good grandmother.  Then the officers did not live very well, I hope that now they are provided with housing and high salaries! <br>  Once, with the onset of cold weather, a mouse family settled in the attic.  Would live quietly, so no - got into the habit of dragging our cereals. <br>  We are not greedy people, but because they spoil the products! <br>  I'm tired ... I treat mice with disgust, and maybe I just can't cook them? <br>  He put on his brains ... the young one was still an officer, not numb.  How to catch and not touch these creatures? <br>  I took a tin container from the VN-6 vacuum oil, roughly speaking - a high square bucket and cut off the upper part.  Next put the box.  On the edge of the box set the fixed bar, secured it with a cunning plate with an axis of rotation.  To keep the plate in a horizontal position, it made a magnetic lock that adjusted a couple of grams of weight at the end.  The design is clear from the figure. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a16/da6/8b5/a16da68b5f28054b6d81a48ebe7f9264.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The magnet holds the bar hard, but at one point (fine for us, this moment is so-so), when the mouse reached the bait and dreamed of eating it, he was no longer able to keep the mass multiplied by the length of the lever and ... <br>  The earth leaves the ground, the mouse experiences a short-term state of weightlessness and, like in an aquapark, flops into a pool of water.  Pour there is not sour cream, beat your paws, do not hit - you will not get butter.  Cruel of course ... but what to do? <br>  In the morning he set a trap and left for the service, in the evening he came back from the service - the caught mouse to the street, the water in the tank, the bar to the platoon, the seed to the edge, he went to sleep.  In the morning, another swam! <br>  Once there was an interesting case ... I come, and then there are two of them - ran to the race for seed?  Or the second in the MOE worked? <br>  In a very short period I caught 13 pieces, saved a supply of cereals, and saved the family from starvation!

      <b>Option 2. Almost electronic.</b> <br>  The officers ended, gardening began.  The mice are the same everywhere - that in the army, that in the civilian ... They are also engaged in theft, this time - the not-ready products in the garden eat up.  Smart, not like a bear in a cartoon - they know that carrots need to eat roots, and not tops. <br>  We are good people, but we do not like rogues.  I decided to scare them a little. <br>  Well, I think, since they are so smart, I use electronics.  They will see that everything is very scary - they will be frightened, they will run away.  A very arrogant and curious just catch.  The model turned out so terrible that even all the components escaped with fear, only the bare printed circuit board remained. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/eb0/e1c/c1a/eb0e1cc1a40ee5665af4986a1de1e8fd.jpg"><br><br>  But it worked surprisingly simply and according to the principle - there sui, it will not come back!  On testing, I thrust a sheet of paper ‚Äî it clamped so tightly that it lifted the whole mousetrap.  The design is symmetrical and has two doors to the mouse hell - they let them in there, but sinners are no longer allowed back - the door rests on the floor. <br>  Installed near the mouse hole ... In the morning the first was there.  Took the neighbor cat. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/95f/827/e88/95f827e88d1eb9f474c666daa39581bf.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Then again, and again, and again ... <br>  Once there was an interesting case ... By the way, I put a brick on this design so that a very large and smart mouse would not turn over the trap - then it would easily find a way out of the hopeless situation.  So, I come ... the brick to the side is lying around (it was 50 centimeters discarded!), Next to the mousetrap is a hole about half a meter deep, the structure itself is turned upside down and empty ... <br>  Or the devil came in or the wild cat smelled the mouse and decided to get it ... Do you remember how the door works?  There he put his paw, and then what was ... I personally did not see, I just imagine. <br>  It was a pity mice.  The last caught carried to the lake, about two hundred meters, and ... let go.  Since then, the mouse and disappeared.  As it seems to me, she was able to return and told about her nightmares, and the rest of them left the garden to pick up a good day. <br><br>  <b>Option 3. Electronic.</b> <br>  In addition to the garden there is also work.  Surprisingly, in the fall, the mice penetrate into the office of a concrete building on the second floor!  How???  You sit in the evening, write a program, do not touch anyone ... And suddenly!  Bold, until you move - they can come very close.  But it is necessary to move, just like an iron cabinet, and look for fistulas ... <br>  We are not proud people, we have old parts and a desire to win. <br>  Seen in the movie as works of art in museums protected?  Rays there are all sorts of beautiful around! <br>  Nature often makes masterpieces!  She is not a creature - a work of art, for example - a seed! <br>  I decided to take care of the sunflower seeds. <br>  On the one hand a ray of light, on the other an old photoresistor <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9c3/1a1/992/9c31a199252a8d0f631fc2d1c9f1210c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  and simple scheme. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/481/940/3cf/4819403cffbba123319edd0cbbed4f22.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In the load - the relay, which plays the role of the trigger. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/506/509/16d/50650916d1de6c40dccc5e23a4ce0092.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Come on in, mouse! <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e2e/50a/299/e2e50a2990e25d7624dd6a8ec67f7039.jpg"><br><br>  While the seed blocks the flow of rays, the relay sleeps without hind legs.  But one has only to kidnap a guarded masterpiece - a ray of death hits a photocell.  Though old, but with fright, it quickly loses its resistance, and the magic field key quickly opens the relay, which releases the door, thus blocking the path to retreat. <br><br>  Well, what? <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b8c/df7/e64/b8cdf7e6405d055f44e5a499937d59bd.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Once there was an interesting case ... next time I will tell. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/137084/">https://habr.com/ru/post/137084/</a></p>
