    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Here, for example, we buy a bicycle and some song, as it is and as the copywriters would like: <br><table><tbody><tr><th></th><th>  Bicycle </th><th>  Song </th></tr><tr><td>  Purchase </td><td>  Buying a bike, we become its OWNER </td><td>  By purchasing a song we do not become the owner of the song.  Yes, yes, even the "purchased" copy! </td></tr><tr><td>  Sale </td><td>  You can sell your bike to anyone.  In any country of the world.  Though in space! </td><td>  You have no right to sell the purchased song.  Just due to the fact that no one sold it to you in fact - see the previous paragraph. </td></tr><tr><td>  Using </td><td>  On an honestly purchased bike, you can ride anywhere, if it does not violate public order and safety. </td><td>  You cannot listen to the purchased song in those places where God forbid anyone can hear it except for you!  If you hear - this is a violation of intellectual property rights! </td></tr><tr><td>  Travels </td><td>  You can take a purchased bike with you to any country in the world where you can even reach with such luggage. </td><td>  A purchased song can only be used in the country where you purchased it.  Do not believe?  Remember the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãDVD discs! </td></tr><tr><td>  The right to "parts" </td><td>  You can disassemble a purchased bike and assemble a cycle mobile from its parts.  Or sell pedals to Uncle Van from Nizhny Tagil, and the wheels - to a boy from Saudi Arabia through E-Bay! </td><td>  From the purchased song you do not even have the right to make a remix or a parody!  About selling couplets to different people, I am silent! </td></tr><tr><td>  Right to quality </td><td>  If the bike squeaks right from the store, it hardly turns the steering wheel, and the pedals look like torture devices - you have the right to return it to the store in the 14-day period.  Yes, yes, even according to such a subjective parameter as ‚ÄúThe seat is rubbing my backside!‚Äù !!! </td><td>  The purchased song, in which the performer is false, squeaks and rubs with his howling brains, you have no right to give back !!!  Unlike the bicycle - the song is considered to be almost as vyzyannoy after even partial listening!  And in general - do not like it - do not buy more!  And the money will not be refunded! </td></tr><tr><td>  Taxes </td><td>  Bicycle manufacturers do not require deductions of 1% of roads under construction, sports forms sold, etc.  etc.  based on the fact that they can be used to ride a bike.  And, yes, from the drivers for the fact that they can potentially move the bike manufacturer, they also do not require deductions! </td><td>  Yes, yes, I mean that ‚ÄúMigalkovsky percentage‚Äù!  Yes, and from carriers.  Yes, and from computers.  And from the media in computers, where without it?  And from cars, because  there is a radio on which you can listen to the media.  No radio?  Pay at all, because  potential to put the car there! </td></tr><tr><td>  Theft </td><td>  The manufacturer has produced a million bicycles at 100 bucks cost.  Sold 999,000 units, 999 did not sell, one was stolen.  Losses manufacturer from stealing?  From 100 to 150 bucks, how to count. </td><td>  The producer wrote one song.  About the cost of silent.  Sold 999,000 copies of it for 10 bucks.  One - spirals.  Losses manufacturer from stolen ???  "One hundred thousand million, because  we expected to sell just that much, which means we didn‚Äôt sell them because of the vile pirates !!!  Let them pay us for lost profits !!! " </td></tr></tbody></table><br><br>  ‚ÄúHow can you compare!  These are completely different things!  Here a farmer grows carrots, and his harvest is flooded! ‚Äù <br>  Okay, let's look at the carrot: <br><table><tbody><tr><th></th><th>  Carrot </th><th>  Film </th></tr><tr><td>  Production </td><td>  A farmer spent a million bucks buying seeds, sowing carrots, growing them.  Carrots grew to ... and five more. </td><td>  The director slammed a million bucks and made a movie.  No "and five more pieces" - stupidly one movie.  Total. </td></tr><tr><td>  Sale </td><td>  A farmer in a crowd sold the entire crop to a dealer for two million. </td><td>  The director sold the tape for five lemons.  He is not such a sucker as a farmer, so that only 100% of profit will be received! </td></tr><tr><td>  Spread </td><td>  Conditionally, we assume that the total yield amounted to one million kilograms.  The store sold the carrots for five bucks per kilo, but a thousand kilograms rotted as they lay on the shelves, and another five hundred kilograms were carried by an old woman in a sleeve. </td><td>  The film was watched by a million people with tickets for 20 bucks, plus a bunch of DVDs with the movie were sold, plus as a reasonable person, the distributor made his small business selling souvenirs, plus toys based on the movie ... And several thousand people downloaded the movie from torrents.  Oh!  What a nightmare!  They are criminals pohlesche dragging carrots!  After all, carrots cannot be resold with a margin hundreds of times what the cost of producing it was !!! </td></tr><tr><td>  Purchase </td><td>  You bought a carrot before you ate it, or it didn't rot - you are the owner of the carrot.  However, even if it is rotten - you are the owner of the rotten carrot! </td><td>  You bought a movie disc.  Or a movie ticket.  You do not become the owner of the purchased film - only the disk, and even that is ‚Äúconditional‚Äù.  About the ticket to the cinema, which often costs more than a movie disc, I am silent - this is generally a ‚Äúsound of money‚Äù! </td></tr><tr><td>  Consumer protection </td><td>  If you bought "the best carrot", as it appears in the advertisement, and you were sold rotten - you have the right to protect your interests. </td><td>  If you were sold a ticket for the ‚Äúbest film‚Äù and showed rottenness - no one will protect your interests.  ‚ÄúFor this is a subjective opinion - Uncle Vasya, to whom we paid with a bottle of vodka for examination, does not consider it rotten!‚Äù </td></tr><tr><td>  Manufacturer Responsibility </td><td>  If the carrot was announced as ‚Äúsuitable for children from 6 years old,‚Äù and the child from this transgenic infection stabbed - the producer is responsible up to the criminal one. </td><td>  If you come with a child to a film with a rating of ‚ÄúFrom 6 years old,‚Äù and there dinosaurs eat people with blood, and during breaks the main character is f ... tons of people around, ranging from pensioners to dinosaurs - the producer is not responsible! </td></tr><tr><td>  Right to use </td><td>  You can eat a purchased carrot, you can squeeze the juice out of it, you can even sell this juice or shove the carrot in yourself ... for sexual pleasure and make a film "where I don‚Äôt need carrot!"  Neither the farmer nor the store can forbid you this. </td><td>  You have the right to watch a purchased movie disc yourself.  Everything.  You have no right to show it to your friends, to arrange a cinema in which to turn a film for money, too.  And God forbid, you will remove the video "As I put the disk where it is not necessary"!  Start with the fact that it hurts, ending with the fact that the right holders will tear the rest of your hole for using their disk without their permission! </td></tr><tr><td>  Taxes </td><td>  The producer of carrots does not require its percentage from the manufacturers of pots and pans, because they can be used to make carrots! </td><td>  Yes, yes, I again about "MIGALKOVSKY PERCENT"! </td></tr></tbody></table><br><br>  ‚ÄúAah!  SAMDURAK, TINICHEGONEPONIMAESH, OURSELVE CREAE CREAE CREAE CREAE CREEKE CREAWEARS CREATIVES AND I WILL NOT DISCEPT ANY EXAMPLES AND FAILURES AND I DO NOT DISPOSE IT, I WILL NOT DISPOSE THEM AS SAMDURAK AND TYHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHIHEHIHEHIHEHEHIHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHESHEURES EXAMPLES AND I WILL NOT DISCUSS I WILL NOT DISCUSS, AND I WILL NOT ARCH <br><br>  Summary? <br>  What kind of resume do you need after the above ?! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/175363/">https://habr.com/ru/post/175363/</a></p>
