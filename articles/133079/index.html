      <i>Situation: I have two stores.</i>  <i>One on the domain natropinkah.ru, the other on the subdomain sumki.natropinkah.ru.</i>  <i>Legally, they work with one Individual Entrepreneur.</i>  <i>They have different price lists.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Your system does not allow you to place a second store, saying that the same company is behind it.</i>  <i>This is true, but I do not see any crime in this.</i>  <i>These are two different brands, but legally one firm.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>But I can‚Äôt specify two price lists and two domains for one store in your system.</i>  <i>And this, too, by the way, is somehow wrong.</i>  <i>One store can quite easily have two sites, for example, for selling the same goods to different categories of buyers.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>But I will not argue - you programmed as programmed.</i>  <i>You will not think about everything at the development stage.</i>  <i>And after development it is usually lazy to finish something.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Question: But what should I do?</i>  <i>Is there a way to get around the system and somehow advertise both stores in it?</i> <br><br>  UPD: Possible solution under the cut. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Answer:</b> <br><br>  The assortment of your stores intersects in the "Bags" section.  Please remove all possible intersections on the assortment on the sites of your stores, as well as in the downloadable price lists.  After that, let us know about it and we will consider the possibility of placing two stores. <br><br>  <b>My letter:</b> <br><br>  Removed all the intersections that I could find. <br><br>  <b>Answer:</b> <br><br>  On the site natropinkah.ru remained section bags.  Placing two stores is impossible. <br><br>  <b>My letter:</b> <br><br>  I do not understand which section is being discussed.  Can I link to confirm? <br><br>  <b>Answer:</b> <br><br>  We are talking about the section "Backpacks and bags": <a href="http://natropinkah.ru/shop/125/">natropinkah.ru/shop/125</a> . <br>  You can transfer all backpacks and bags from the natropinkah.ru store to the sumki.natropinkah.ru store. <br><br>  <b>My letter:</b> <br><br>  Transfer unrealistic.  In tourism goods, people should be able to buy hiking backpacks and hunting backpacks, cartridge belts and duffel bags. <br><br>  But the goods in the stores are different and do not overlap. <br><br>  There are hiking and tourist backpacks and bags of the same brands in the shop on the Paths, and bags in the store. On the paths there are backpacks and city-type bags, handbags and wallets of completely different manufacturers.  These are different and completely non-overlapping products. <br><br>  <b>Answer:</b> <br><br>  In this case, to accommodate both stores on the Market, we can only suggest deleting the section ‚ÄúBackpacks and Bags‚Äù from natropinkah.ru website - products from this category can be placed on sumki.natropinkah.ru.  Unfortunately, we cannot offer any other solution. <br><br>  <b>My letter:</b> <br><br>  And if I change the legal data of the purse store shop. Unlike the details of my wife? <br><br>  <b>Answer:</b> <br><br>  The uniqueness of the details is not the determining factor in the recognition of stores similar.  In this case, it will not change the decision on the possibility of simultaneously hosting two stores of the same owner. <br><br>  <b>My letter:</b> <br><br>  Do not really understand.  The goods are different, the activities are different, the owners will be different.  What is the similarity? <br><br>  <b>Answer:</b> <br><br>  We do not disclose the criteria for which we recognize stores as similar. <br><br>  <b>My letter:</b> <br><br>  Good.  Then the question is: how to arrange both domains as one store?  The flexibility of the system should be at least some.  And that nonsense continuous turns out. <br><br>  <b>Dry residue:</b> <br><br>  And so, the situation: no normal solution has been proposed, I myself cannot find a solution, even if I could give a clue where to go.  And it resembles an unbreakable wall. <br><br>  <b>UPD: Possible Solution</b> <br><br>  Addressing senior managers was a good thing.  Dear Alexei Shafranov suggested the solution: <br><br>  <i>Must wa disappoint, two of your store natropinkah.ru, sumki.natropinkah.ru we perceive as one, which has two selected directions.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>What can be offered.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>You can unload in one order, for example, which is now connected, goods sumki.natropinkah.ru</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Terms of delivery, respectively, may be different, in accordance with the goods.</i>  <i>As far as I see this data you transmit via XML and can flexibly customize the output.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>You can do this in one file or in different ones.</i>  <i>I can insert the link <a href="">sumki.natropinkah.ru/foryand.xml</a> into an existing order</i> <i><br></i>  <i>And we will take the data from two links.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>The only problem is that for different products you can not display a different name of the store.</i> <br><br>  For me, it was not grief, but, on the contrary, joy.  Now I brought all the goods bags in the price trails.  The fact that both sites count for one store is good. <br><br>  So, if you make a store and demarcate its work directions into subdomains, feel free to stack all the products in one XML. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/133079/">https://habr.com/ru/post/133079/</a></p>
