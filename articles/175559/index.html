Part five</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good night for everyone and Friday morning for everyone who starts working day on Friday with Habr ... <br>  Me again. <br>  Here, I got out, or rather to say - a bit snatched an hour from the dream on the topic: it is necessary to write a little (and with the intent of selfish too), how things are and how it goes in general in my design.  For those who are not in the subject, further links to previous articles: <br>  Part number 1: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/124427/">habrahabr.ru/post/124427</a> <br>  Part number 2: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/138874/">habrahabr.ru/post/138874</a> <br>  Part number 3: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/150196/">habrahabr.ru/post/150196</a> <br>  Part number 4: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/156573/">habrahabr.ru/post/156573</a> <br><br>  Well, who is already in the subject - we will continue. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  I disappeared again, but my loss is not due to the fact that he continues to pursue the dialogue, and for the most part because I was a little short of 24 hours for everything, and for some reason they are becoming more and more around my development. <br>  Briefly close up, and then a bit of detail: <br>  1) The system went into the ‚Äúworking‚Äù stage, by which I mean: it began to save and really saves the experiences of those who are stuck with them in the most ... glands in marketing tricks of brand manufacturers scada systems.  Already the third system for 1 year!  And this is only the beginning ... <br>  2) My department has not been working on brands for the second year already - we are already sitting tight on my design and my engineers are only happy about this.  Honestly, I love fire in the eyes of an engineer when he sees that he is working on a result and he can control this result, and not in a state of extreme and dependent consumer.  They are especially warmed up by the fact that we are working on the real needs of the market, and not on marketing bullshit, so that it is easier to push something to someone and do not care for what. <br>  2) I did break the development of the next version of scud on new technologies.  From the current users of the system to whom I showed my prototypes I heard only one question: ‚ÄúWhen?‚Äù. <br>  3) The year 2013 started and continues in continuous twists of the Cirque du Soleil. <br>  4) In April, I have an exhibition.  One of the companies that worked with me earlier - offered its booth at the exhibition for mutual PR: I make them a demo booth based on my scud, and they give me their platform for PR and advertising. <br>  5) I am already invited by large companies in the face of their generals to ‚Äútalk‚Äù and I return home with contracts in my pocket in volumes of average 10 lyams just because I ‚Äúliked‚Äù their engineers first, because they worked and tried my scooter , and now they are pulling a guide with the words "we want it."  It's funny, but now this whole business must also be properly handled, my company, looking at all this, decided that it was time to put the daughter on the rails.  What is now passing and doing too.  I want to make a competent production, development and support with system integration, it's worth it.

      Now a little about the work.  I want to slightly sum up the past and the current year: today, on the basis of my scud, two serious objects have been launched and are already running: <br>  1) 8500 I / O points with the following functions: <br>  - hot backup servers with system recovery time in a period of not more than 30 seconds <br>  - dynamic switching of the automated workplace of operating personnel between servers and the diagnosis of network equipment by the quality of communication channels.  By the way, this function allowed us to show that we are not camels, and modern IT companies make decisions out of their hands badly. At the facility, even the precedent was when the system simply lay tight due to network equipment, and only having logs in my hands I could prove that is not a camel <br>  - dynamic provision of functions and information, depending on the access rights of operational personnel with the registration of all their actions in a single system log with subsequent reports on diagnostics by AWS and action <br>  - preliminary buffering of data from the controllers so that the system can work even in full ‚Äúdown‚Äù (only on PLC and ODR), and then provide the user with all logs and archives after recovery how she behaved and what was done to her until she worked and raped her hands <br>  - synchronization of time stamps for all nodes of the system by a single time stamp with a quality not worse than 20 ms across all nodes and equipment.  I applied the SNTP standard, and for WinCE, I even had to develop my own SNTP standard, which could provide an acceptable quality error. <br>  - interface to up to 30 third-party subsystems within one automated control system <br><br>  Now, for almost a year of operation of this system, its archives of technological parameters reach approximately 40-50 Gigabytes of data on the archive server, and logs, trends and reports generated by the system at the request of operating personnel live in peacefully with them. <br><br>  By the way, according to this system, I have already passed a serious commission on "state acceptance" - many serious uncles have tyrkal it, they have written many comments, which mostly fell into the category of "cosmetic" improvements.  So, for me, even something like an internal ego was when I was told that the system looks very good and can compete quite seriously at the level of global brands. <br>  No wonder I tried, and we try still. <br><br>  2) at 24,500 I / O points with the following functions: <br>  - interface of the lower project equipment with the top level system based on WinCC <br>  - algorithmic processing of network exchange transactions between my scud and Siemens S7-400 controller via Ethternet network (24500 points on average takes about 800ms without much pressure on the exchange cycle (although I had to sweat a little to make such a chip in my room) ). The controller transmits signals from my system to WinCC in the Profibus / ProfiNet protocol. <br><br>  3) Approximately 3 third-party developers knocked, took the system and actually implemented projects for third-party customers, but they were not very big in terms, but they were really significant for me.  The main thing is feedback, people liked it, albeit with jambs, which I promptly ruled.  But, unlike brands, I listened, listened and made edits, but did not write a formal reply ... <br><br>  Literally 2 weeks ago, I was informed about the next ‚Äúpriest‚Äù - and now, waving a ‚Äúscada-maine‚Äù cloak, right now my engineer is sitting on an object that implements the shortest time in a super-duper: he alone does the project on my scooter base almost 5,000 I / O points right on site for 3 weeks.  Already 2nd ends and the results are quite positive.  Before us, they tried to do it for 1 year with forces that were much more superior than the current capacities in terms of head-to-man-hands.  But, the main thing is that the head-hands of people grow from the right places, then everything can be done ... <br><br>  The smallness is crumpled and messy, but the truth is, I want to sleep for a day already, and there is still a lot of things ahead, but everything is so interesting that it‚Äôs even a pity to waste time sleeping ... <br><br>  PS As for the exhibition, I'll post the info here a little later, it will be held in April of this year (from the 15th to the 18th) so everyone who wants to meet me in person and just talk to me, feel my system (not me ), discuss - come!  I would be glad.  :) <br><br>  <b>UPDATE:</b> Here are the links to the invitation materials of the company, which shelters me at its stand: <br>  <a href="http://promo.tssec.ru/asutp">promo.tssec.ru/asutp</a> <br><br>  Stand address: All-Russia Exhibition Center, Pavilion 75, B335, Hall B <br><br>  We will demonstrate a small installation for inflating balls with the functions of interaction with the video surveillance system. <br><br>  In the same place there are coordinates of their stand, so come, we will communicate live, and I will show the development in business and in general. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/175559/">https://habr.com/ru/post/175559/</a></p>
