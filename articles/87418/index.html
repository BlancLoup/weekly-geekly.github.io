Power - in the blog!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I'll tell you about my experience of running your blog.  I am a trader.  More than 3 years in this business.  He worked at Broco, worked at IBCapital.  Traded on their own, developed the vehicle, earned and lost money, gaining experience.  I had to work at the main job, work at the forums of these companies, trade, study literature, and devote time to my family. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Even then, I realized that it is possible and necessary to live in such a way as not to think about how to stretch to paycheck, work as a pleasure, receive a material reward not in the form of a fixed sn, which someone fixed, but in accordance with the love and diligence invested in what you do <br><br>  At some point, I made my website dedicated to trading.  Screwed the forum to which my friends and colleagues came.  But something was wrong.  Maybe the time has not come, maybe it has not seen where to go.  I took it down one fine moment.  He continued to work.  As often happens, with the employer periodically there are questions, inconsistencies, disagreement with politics ... And I felt bored and crowded within the framework of what and how I was doing under the guidance of other people ... It was time to think again about my site.  And I chose the blog format.  He began to study everything he could find on the topic of blogging.

      I came to the following conclusion: if you are an expert in a certain issue, go ahead!  Make a blog on your favorite topic, fill with content, optimize, follow the development strategy, accompany with interesting materials and stories about life, interact with the audience and stay on the chosen path. <br><br>  No sooner said than done. <br><br>  In general, at first it was necessary to devote just a lot of time to working with a blog.  Sat after midnight.  Customized, reworked, optimized.  I thought about what and how to write.  Read blogs, books, rethink the experience.  The more I did it, the more I liked it.  It happened, of course, that hands were falling.  For different reasons.  Overwork, dissatisfaction with results, stress.  It was thought - why all this?  But time heals.  A few days pass, a week, two, and you are back in the ranks, ready again to share with the readers what is in your heart and mind. <br><br>  At the same time, I recommended to my friends and colleagues to do the same, because you never know where you will find yourself tomorrow, what will happen in your life, and having a blog is your resume, your diary, after reading which people will be able to find what you were looking for.  And who knows, maybe this is how a person can find an interesting job or like-minded people.  By the way, now some of them are in a piquant situation related to the possible loss of work.  And, believe me, those few people who started their blogs a few months ago already have their own starting site, unlike those who did not do anything ... <br><br>  So, at a certain point I finally broke up with the management of the company where I worked.  This happened quite recently.  Probably, it was affected by the fact that I was already tired of performing irrational and unreasonable work, which was assigned to me and spoke out very sharply about it.  Well, at least I left myself, being ready for such a development of events. <br><br>  There was a question, what next?  Since what I am writing here can be applied to a blog on any subject, and not just on the topic of trading, which implies a certain financial viability, let's mention such monetization methods as placement of paid banners, Adsenses, guards, etc. This is not serious sight.  Not serious both in terms of earnings and primitivism. <br><br>  What did I do? <br><br>  I just hung up the ‚ÄúPartnership‚Äù page, on which I offered my services and knowledge for mutually beneficial cooperation with interested people.  And almost immediately received numerous responses to his post.  There are people for whom my blog is interesting, interesting for me, as its author.  I am very pleased that the efforts I spent were not in vain.  I am doubly pleased that people find the answers to their questions in my posts. <br><br>  Now attendance in the region of 130-200 visitors per day, the failure rate is less than 1%, the percentage of visitors who come through search engines is increasing. <br><br>  What I want to recommend to those who are themselves experts in some field and are ready to engage in the creation and promotion of their blog. <br><br>  1. First of all, you need to understand - that the blog is you.  You, as a person, as a person.  Need to be interesting to people.  Need to open up before them.  Although, of course, there are dissatisfied and someone can spit on you - no big deal.  This is normal.  The more a person comes forward, the more clearly he realizes that the reaction to his personality becomes differentiated.  Do not slip into squabbles, pay more attention to the audience that understands and respects you.  Let it be 3-5 people first, in a year they will be 300-500, and this, you see, is worth a lot. <br><br>  2. Do not give up if something does not work.  Water wears away a stone.  How many people became known and in demand only due to the fact that all the time they were beating at one point.  The main thing is patience. <br><br>  3. Keep the goal in mind: I want my experience, my knowledge and my approach to the business to receive due recognition.  To do this, increase your professionalism, learn new things.  No need to doubt your abilities or think about yourself in a derogatory tone.  Do not focus on the standard and primitive forms of monetization. <br><br>  For example: are you special in installing / reinstalling / updating / restoring Windows?  Cool!  I have this experience at the most simple level.  And if I caught the eye of your blog, I would have paid you without any problems in reinstalling my beta 7 to normal with saving all the information and software to the maximum.  Especially if we live in the same city. <br><br>  And if you are an apartment repair specialist?  It‚Äôs not difficult to collect people who repair something on their blog. <br><br>  Can you write funny poems?  Well, write them on your blog - take orders for congratulations, rhyming statements of some ideas of customers, etc. <br><br>  If you are an expert on real estate in Moscow - over time you can provide private services, legally formalizing your activities, having already gained an audience. <br><br>  If you are a gamer, lay out reviews of games and if you can write beautifully, you can eventually write reviews for companies producing PC toys. <br><br>  If you are a geek, then how to know if you will receive an offer from any patron who simply liked you with his creative approach and non-standard solutions ... <br><br>  There are lots of options.  The main thing is to understand that your blog will be in demand if your knowledge solves people's problems or helps them in some issues. <br><br>  5. Be sure to blog on the topic that leads you to the delight that you love.  Otherwise - the pipe.  Let it be a blog about contacts with aliens, but with a drive and emotions than a blog about marketing, which you do not understand. <br><br>  6. They often say to me: well, this is how a blog runs; it has only 10 dollars a month.  This is a penny ... What can I say?  Do not look for reasons to opt out of blogging.  Do not look at those who do not understand where he is going.  Serve the best that you have.  Think in advance about what you want: money for your knowledge, fame in certain circles or the search for partners.  And you will succeed.  Sure. <br><br>  Good luck! <br><br>  <a href="http://deipara.com/">My blog: Overclocking deposit.</a>  <a href="http://deipara.com/">Jesse Livermore Club</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/87418/">https://habr.com/ru/post/87418/</a></p>
