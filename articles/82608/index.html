  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The case against Augmented Reality</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  At a recent conference at the University of Bologna, Zhanmarko pointed out that when discussing AR-technologies, only positive aspects are always considered.  After that, I thought about the negative aspects of technology. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fd6/df9/8d5/fd6df98d508146068f107c42534bc84b.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <strong>Privacy:</strong> We discussed recently that users can geotag your content without you being able to control it.  For example, your mother, having come to visit you, created a tweet about your priceless collection of vaz of the Ming dynasty.  The location of your house is recorded (geotagged) and accessible to all for viewing, along with a list of all your most valuable belongings in it.  An advanced thief, using the latest version of BurglAR, will be able to find valuable things to steal from nearby houses.  Although the geo-tagging is disturbing, but this is not a problem caused by augmented reality, your mother can upload a geo-tagging image with the vases of the Ming dynasty on Facebook or Flik, ‚Äã‚Äãso the same data will be available through Google maps. <br><br>  <strong>Location:</strong> Programs that track a person‚Äôs real-time location can be listed on your fingers: Google Latitude, Ping, Hayway - as an example.  The location data is not ‚Äúlive‚Äù, the application asks for your location or you update it periodically so people cannot track your movements in real time.  What can happen if people know your location?  Perhaps a thief can find out when you are not at home and steal your collection of vases, but again, this is not an augmented reality problem.

      <strong>Data from third sources:</strong> Layar did an excellent thing, giving developers the opportunity to create their own layers.  I looked through a list of about 300 layers, looking for something to use for evil purposes.  Unfortunately, for the criminal world, it turned out that the Layer will not help achieve world domination.  There are even interesting layers that will tell me, for example, what products are sold in the district.  Knowing this, I can send my accomplices to patrol the streets, tracking down valuables that have just been sold.  But I am sure that these data do not correspond to reality, so it is much easier for a thief to sit outside the electronic store and watch someone‚Äôs house. <br><br>  <strong>Users:</strong> Users are at risk using augmented reality, but more because of stupidity.  For example, walking with the phone or falling into the hatch, because they do not look where they are going, but the same thing will happen when tivitng while driving or walking. <br><br><img src="http://sohos.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/textmessagedriving.jpg"><br><br>  <strong>Hollywood:</strong> There is a very high risk of lousy AR directed films.  Remember the lawnmower from virtual reality? <br>  It is difficult to see even a little negative in the current implementation of mobile AR-applications.  They only provide a new way to display existing data.  And the data is already freely available from various sources and presented in other forms. <br><br><h3>  Is there no potential evil in augmented reality? </h3><br>  <strong>Face Recognition:</strong> When the technology of augmented reality becomes sufficiently developed and we can recognize objects by pointing a phone at them (or using special glasses), then I think something negative will happen.  Let's imagine someone made an application that scans police crime bases.  And so it happened that you have similarities with the criminal, suddenly you discover that you are not allowed to enter the shops.  Worse, if you are mistakenly recognized as a sex maniac and destroy your life. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/89b/1d3/110/89b1d3110cc5561a4be9068597d7bdee.png"><br><br>  <strong>Advertising:</strong> It is everywhere, whether you like it or not.  Territorially oriented advertising gains the opportunity to be sent to you directly to your mobile gadget while you are walking along the avenues of your city.  You can take it as negative or positive on your own. <br><br>  <strong>Pornography: The</strong> porn industry is often the first to use new technologies.  She is already slowly but noticeably starting to use virtual and augmented reality.  Negative?  Definitely if you find yourself not standing by this business. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/699/12f/b95/69912fb95254347f40bba9a4d8f52da2.jpg"><br><br>  I have not found the inevitable negative consequences of popularizing AR, so I‚Äôll ask you.  Suppose you decide to commit a robbery of the century, or to seize power over the world, how can augmented reality be able to help you in achieving this goal? <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/82608/">https://habr.com/ru/post/82608/</a></p>
