Interesting blogs for which there is a desire to subscribe - in the minority, blogs are dominated by clearly amateur character. <br><br>  In this article I tried to highlight the advantages and disadvantages of 10 blogs that belong to companies of various fields of activity and different levels of business.  Based on this analysis, it is possible to add a general opinion about the Russian-speaking corporate blogosphere as a whole. <br><br>  <a href="http://sldru.livejournal.com/">The magazine "Soldier of Fortune"</a> <br>  A blog is more than a year old, which is quite a substantial time for a Runet corporate blog.  I remember, in his time, Alexey Novikov in a report on corporate blogs set as an example this particular blog.  Objectively, a blog is very good-looking and seems to do a good job with its functions.  Unless comments like ‚ÄúPut such and such a knife until 18 in the evening in such a shop - I‚Äôll come and buy it‚Äù is not evidence of success?

      Frankly, I have never been a particular fan of multi-commodity goods, but having looked through the LJ ‚ÄúSoldier of Fortune‚Äù, I caught fire to acquire some interesting things.  Probably the other day I will visit the nearest store :) <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <a href="http://blog.megafoncity.ru/">MegaFon blog</a> <br>  Honestly, I didn‚Äôt expect such a blog from Megaphone.  The blog periodically (2-3 times a month) publishes press releases, and it is completely not adapted to the format of the blog. <br>  In order to leave comments, you need to register (apparently so I could not find any comments).  In addition, for some reason, a block of links to third-party sites hangs on the blog, with anchors that are clearly designed to transfer the link.  Why ‚ÄúMegafon‚Äù to place links on OSAGO on its blog is not very clear to me.  Although, on the other hand, Beeline has no such blog ... <br><br>  <a href="http://cekc.by/blog/">Diary of life online sex shop</a> <br>  This blog deserves the title of ‚Äúthe most original corporate blog‚Äù.  The site tells about the everyday life of the Belarusian sex shop.  Keep a blog (at least according to the profile) 2 girls - online sex shop consultants.  On the blog a lot of their photos, and sometimes very piquant properties.  Content - interesting articles about sex, plus comments on the assortment of the store.  The style of presenting information is very true - personal, moderately informal.  Blog entries are actively commented, in general, the blog is very focused on interactive.  In my opinion, if you start blogging more closely, you can significantly increase the sales of the store itself - in any case, the basis for this has already been laid. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.altaforum.ru/blog/">Blog Webalta</a> <br>  As they say - what a pop, and such a parish.  What kind of Webalta we have is its blog.  The latest update is dated May, posts are for the most part IT general articles, such as the history of emoticons and uninteresting corporate news, for example: "Webalta participates in the Russian Internet Forum."  We did not hear any SMO in Webalta - I couldn‚Äôt even find the RSS subscription button.  The guys recently talked a lot about changing the PR-image, it even seems to have changed the staff of the PR department, but I would advise you to pay more attention to such a simple and, at the same time, effective PR tool as a corporate blog. <br><br>  <a href="http://blog.mann-ivanov-ferber.ru/">Corporate blog publishing house "Mann, Ivanov, Ferber"</a> <br>  ‚ÄúMann, Ivanov, Ferber‚Äù are the real favorites of the Russian blogosphere.  In my subjective assessment, one of the important reasons for the dizzying success of a publisher is precisely a serious approach to the corporate blog and well-built relationships with the blogosphere. <br><br>  Almost all employees of the publishing house conduct a blog alternately, and sometimes guest posts are written by authors of published books (recall posts of Gleb Arkhangelsky and Alexander Shumovich).  There are active discussions on the blog and, of course, the fact that the publisher listens and implements the advice of readers cannot fail to enchant.  An indicator of success can be the fact that during the entire existence of a blog, I have not seen a single negative comment on it. <br><br>  <a href="http://att-ru.livejournal.com/">Online diary of the company Alternative Fuel Technologies</a> <br>  LJ-shny "korporativnik" company Alternative fuel technology.  About the blog is eloquently the fact that, despite the one and a half year history, the blog was not zafrenil not one person.  In principle, it is not surprising - who might be interested in posts with headlines like: ‚ÄúThe on-site meeting of the Ural Union of Timbermen in Kourovka.‚Äù <br><br>  <a href="http://blogbrandaid.com/">BrandAid Branding Company Blog</a> <br>  The blog is very interesting, the articles are divided into 3 types: the agency's own activity, market review, and also posts on branding (I really liked the post ‚ÄúTen worst slogans‚Äù).  All posts are lively and interesting.  Designed a blog is very interesting, but forgot about the SMO here.  Apparently, the blog audience has not yet formed - there are not enough comments.  But in general, the blog is developing in the right direction. <br><br>  <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/bpf_daily/">Project Finance Bank</a> <br>  Gray and boring blog, posts are boring press releases and official interviews with the top of the bank (I hope because of this phrase I will not get into any "black" bank lists).  Do you think this is a good starting point for a blog post: ‚ÄúThe Federal Financial Markets Service of Russia has included information on the agent AGANA Management Company - Project Financing Bank (CJSC)‚Äù in the register of mutual investment funds? <br><br>  <a href="http://jobr.ru/blog/">Jobr</a> <br>  In principle, the success of this blog is quite predictable - how can a blog with author's expert articles on such an exciting topic as work in Moscow be not successful?  From the blog posts, you can learn about the demand for IT-specialists in Moscow, as well as about who the ‚Äúpeople-bubbles‚Äù are.  I did not find boring posts here. <br><br>  The blog has its own audience - 175 subscribers, which is very good for a corporate blog.  It is noticeable that some attention is paid to the SMO blog, there is also a large orange RSS-button, and a section ‚ÄúAbout the blog‚Äù, and ‚ÄúRecommended posts‚Äù.  The main disadvantage is irregular update.  On average, there are 2-3 posts per month. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.prostobank.com/ru/komanda/blogi/">Blog Prostobank Consulting</a> <br>  One of the few banking blogs with "live" content.  Bank employees publish analytics in a format adapted for the blog.  The design of the blog is very lame, it looks more like a selection of articles.  The blog has its own audience, the entries are commented.  If you change the very concept of design (for example, go to wordpress) - a blog can be exemplary for the banking sector. <br><br>  So, we can draw the following conclusions. <br><br>  In most companies, blogging is done by employees (which is good), but these employees are not always aware of the difference between the press release and blog post formats (which is bad). <br><br>  From the point of view of the SMO, I met only 2 blogs that were effectively optimized.  So for Sheller there is still a lot of work. <br><br>  Most of the good blogs from companies involved in IT and retail.  Large business companies mainly publish official information on blogs, turning them into regular platforms for press releases and losing a lot of opportunities for effective public relations. <br><br>  In the Russian-speaking segment of the Internet today, corporate blogging is just emerging, taking the first cautious steps.  Even large brands, with developed PR-policy, are still mostly just looking at the blogosphere. <br><br>  The potential of this direction is huge - I am sure that in a year and a half in Russia a boom of corporate blogs will begin.  The absence of an interesting, regularly updated blog for which at least one hundred people are subscribed will be regarded as a sign of an ineffective PR policy.  The main problem that companies will face is the lack of experienced, formed specialists in corporate blogs. <br><br>  In a word, we are waiting for the arrival of the business in the blogosphere. <br><br>  Author: <a href="http://www.seowrite.ru/">Damir Khalilov</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/16445/">https://habr.com/ru/post/16445/</a></p>
