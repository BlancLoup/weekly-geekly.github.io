At present, Belarusians could only visit those sites that are physically located in Belarus, the <a href="http://afn.by/">FSA</a> website writes. <br><br>  In an instant, the Bynet turned into a local network, and Belarus at the same time became the second country in the world without access to the global world wide web.  As you know, a few years ago, North Korea announced the creation of its own Internet counterpart - residents of this country were able to browse only North Korean websites with content that is consistent with the policies pursued in the country.  Only the highest-ranking officials and a limited number of government bodies have access to the IC in the global Internet. <a name="habracut"></a>

      Belarus took a step further - during a technical failure, even A. Lukashenko did not have access to the Internet (theoretically it could be switched to external channels that the National Academy of Sciences and the Belarusian railway were allowed to have).  The dream of supporters of censorship on the Internet has come true for a while - sites with inappropriate government propaganda and ideology, in short, with obscene content, have become inaccessible. <br><br>  Despite the fact that Belarus in terms of the development of the Internet and related services is backward by modern standards, the country, however, Belarusian business, yet technologically advanced over the past few years, fully felt what is fraught with state monomony on external communication channels.  Today, many companies use the Internet in their daily activities, and not only for viewing news, LiveJournal, classmates and other contacts.  On the Internet, specialized software is tied up, including technological. <br><br>  Do not put eggs in one basket - says wisdom.  However, the Belarusian authorities are unlikely to make an appropriate conclusion from today's technical emergency, since there is too much desire to control everything and everyone. <br><br>  <b>"Chasnaya" competition</b> <br><br>  Customers directly working with Beltelecom did not notice any problems with access to the world Internet.  This allows us to conclude that the problem was only partially related to the functioning of international communication channels and arose due to the ‚Äúquality‚Äù service of a state monopolist selling channels ‚Äúto the world‚Äù to commercial providers and obviously not wishing to carry out technical work at night.  According to experts, at the height of the working day, Beltelecom decided to engage in connecting an additional communication channel to the global network. <br><br>  Internet access was absent for more than two hours.  The state monopolist Beltelecom admitted his guilt, claiming one of the routers failed.  This statement of a state enterprise allows anyone, if any, to file a lawsuit in court for damages. <br><br>  Based on materials from <a href="http://www.charter97.org/ru/news/2009/10/1/22433/">Charter-97</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/71224/">https://habr.com/ru/post/71224/</a></p>
