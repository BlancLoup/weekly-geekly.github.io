It is possible to sort out the answers to this question for a long time, but almost everyone will agree with one of the options - ‚ÄúThe admin must be lazy‚Äù! <br><br>  A ‚Äúlazy‚Äù administrator is a professional who always uses the optimal approach both in minimizing risks and in automating his work.  The main field of action of most system administrators is the configuration and configuration of various systems.  And of course, besides the most various other tasks, sooner or later each administrator faces the need to write very diverse scripts - such mini programs that run different scenarios, like changing settings, and various related actions. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Many tasks of today's administrators contain a large number of routine operations - creating accounts and other objects, changing a set of parameters, using various templates, managing and controlling various processes, etc ... For most of these actions, administrators use a considerable number of administrative tools, consoles, programs and interfaces.  Very often, the performance of certain operations manually requires the use of several successively, and often quite a large number of such tools.  And it takes time, and indeed, the implementation of routine operations "hands" - a little exciting activities, tedious and not "lazy" ... <br><br>  The Microsoft platform dominant in most corporate IT infrastructures has been using the same for all products the ideology of automation management using PowerShell technology.  It is PowerShell that allows a ‚Äúlazy‚Äù system administrator to create an executable script to solve absolutely any task.  Moreover, it is often the case that if it is impossible to solve the task of setting up a particular system parameter without PowerShell, it is extremely difficult.  In other words, the modern "lazy" system administrator without PowerShell, "and not tudes, and not syudy" ...

      By itself, the PowerShell technology appeared in response to the many needs and tasks that arose precisely by system administrators.  At the same time, Microsoft managed to not only achieve good continuity with old systems management technologies, such as WMI, but also create a very advanced environment that allows you to write executable code that can solve any task, while respecting all the standards of security, manageability and control. <br><br>  The full transition to the technology of administering Microsoft products with such a powerful tool as PowerShell led to the fact that it is not uncommon for PowerShell to be the only means of managing various new functions, since the developers simply did not have time to create any graphical tools for administering new functions. <br><br>  At the same time, most novice system administrators get used to various graphical interfaces, and no matter how deeply exploring PowerShell, a tool that primarily uses a text-based command line interface and executable script files, for many such administrators, this is not a simple process that takes time, effort and ... understanding many things about object-oriented programming.  And it is here that the barrier often works - the study of PowerShell requires, in addition to the often scarce time, also the study and adoption of a number of concepts, concepts and approaches that are familiar to programmers, but little known to system administrators.  And this is not such a small amount of knowledge ... <br><br>  There is another ‚Äútrick‚Äù in the study of PowerShell, as it is not strange, hindering the mastering of this technology in the first place to the specialists of the ‚Äúold school‚Äù.  PowerShell technology appeared relatively recently - less than 10 years ago.  But its all-encompassing, in the management of Microsoft products, the role reached and that later - about 5-6 years ago.  Everything previously used in Microsoft products, command-line interfaces, and scripting / scripting environments differ from PowerShell like earth and sky. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/29b/413/183/29b413183e434491b4766cafb18c478b.jpg"><br><br>  The easiest way to learn PowerShell is for administrators who have experience using similar technologies on different UNIX systems.  But even here there is one thing - PowerShell in a very successful implementation of Microsoft, went a little further in its capabilities than its UNIX counterparts.  This is a powerful new mechanism for pipelines, and full integration with the ubiquitous WMI, AD DS, and other Microsoft technologies.  As a result, such ‚Äúnarrow-mindedness‚Äù can even limit the perception of new features in PowerShell, especially if you try to use this technology without careful study, using the ‚Äúscientific" method. <br><br>  A universal solution for all the situations described can be training on the intensive, specialized, five-day, authorized Microsoft course ‚Äú <a href="http://training.muk.ua/courses/microsoft-professional/7883/">Administration Automation with Windows PowerShell 3.0 -10961</a> ‚Äù. <br><br>  First, the course itself involves learning from scratch - it provides all the basic knowledge and skills necessary to effectively use PowerShell. <br><br>  Secondly, the whole course is full of practical tasks and examples of ‚Äúfrom life‚Äù, i.e.  All practical exercises are very similar to the real day-to-day tasks of a typical system administrator.  From the banal, both standard and not so much, tasks that can be put by the company's management, to complex solutions for the remote management of the enterprise infrastructure as a whole. <br><br>  Thirdly, the course is really aimed primarily at automating the work of the system administrator.  Those.  He is exactly about how to become a "lazy" admin, able to automate their work. <br><br>  Fourthly, in the course of the course PowerShell is considered in great detail ‚Äúin depth‚Äù, incl.  and in matters of advanced scripting, and in matters of the specialized settings of the PowerShell environment itself. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fb5/887/a68/fb5887a688c54f498fa5e3bcde516d04.jpg"><br><br>  Of course, you can study PowerShell yourself.  After all, there are many books, libraries of knowledge and other sources ... But to learn something new, in conditions when your work is not conducive to this ... and study 5 full-fledged days with a professional instructor, in a company like you admins who want to become "Lazy pros" ... Agree, there is a difference, and it is very significant ... <br><br>  <i>Vladimir Stepanets.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>expert teacher</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Microsoft Certified Trainer</i> <br><br>  And so, on the eve of the New Year, the MUK Training Center announces the campaign "Become a lazy Microsoft administrator, invest your savings in better training." <br><br>  The set of a group for the course ‚Äú <a href="http://training.muk.ua/courses/microsoft-professional/7883/">Automation of Administration with Windows PowerShell 4.0 -10961</a> ‚Äù opened on December 14-18, 2015. <br>  Learn about other Microsoft technologies <a href="http://training.muk.ua/raspisanie_kursov/">here</a> in the Schedule section. <br><br>  More Microsoft courses: <br>  December 14 - 18 - <a href="http://training.muk.ua/courses/mcsa-administrirovanie-microsoft-windows-server-2008-2012/7832/">Practical application of group policies in Windows / Ureful Results of Group Policy in Windows</a> <br>  December 21 - 25 - <a href="http://training.muk.ua/courses/microsoft-professional/7882/">Deploy and manage Windows 10 using enterprise services.</a>  <a href="http://training.muk.ua/courses/microsoft-professional/7882/">Deploying and Managing Windows 10 Using Enterprise Services</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/271581/">https://habr.com/ru/post/271581/</a></p>
