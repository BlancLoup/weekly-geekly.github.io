  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Yandex can launch its own product delivery service</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The company " <a href="https://www.yandex.ru/">Yandex</a> " plans to organize the delivery service of goods from "Yandex.Market" to customers.  July 28 should be a presentation of the project of the domestic company, <a href="http://top.rbc.ru/technology_and_media/24/07/2015/55b0d67c9a79476a6d6a7bb2">writes</a> "RBC".  Delivery will be made from various regions, including China. <br><br>  According to a source familiar with the company's plans, Yandex plans to strengthen its presence in the regions, so the company is also calculating the opportunity to start its own warehouses.  Also, the source said that Yandex is looking for an opportunity to arrange delivery from China, from small suppliers to the final buyer.  The main direction of work - children's products and electronics. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Perhaps, the logistics project will work on the basis of the MultiShip delivery services aggregator.  Yandex acquired this company in January 2014.  Last year, MultiShip software was purchased for $ 1 million, a little later, the buyer invested several million dollars into MultiShip.  Note that at the time of the acquisition of this service, almost all major Russian delivery services were connected to it, including Axiomus, B2Cpl, Boxberry, CDEK, Maxima Express, PickPoint, QIWI Post, CourierServiceExpress, Pony Express.  Also, this service has about 300 online stores. <br><br>  However, in September 2014, Yandex stopped working with MultiShip.  ‚ÄúFollowing the results of the first quarters of joint work, it became clear to both parties that companies have different approaches to doing business and different ideas about its development,‚Äù the Yandex press service reported last year.

      <br>
      A source close to the participants in the transaction, the entire MultiShip team started developing a new startup, losing interest in the old project that could not be scaled inside Yandex. <br><br>  So far, Yandex.Market did not deal with the delivery of goods - the sellers were engaged in logistics.  If the delivery will be carried out by Yandex, the cost of services for partners will probably be increased.  In addition, the number of partners among online merchants will also be expanded.  Perhaps the service will interest foreign partners who would like to increase the supply of goods to Russia. <br><br>  It is possible that one of the incentives to open your own logistics service for Yandex was the entry of the largest Chinese company, JD.com, into the Russian market.  Now the Chinese site is already registered in Yandex.Market, but has not yet been moderated. <br><br>  Representatives of JD.com deny negotiations on a strategic partnership with Yandex.Market. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/292990/">https://habr.com/ru/post/292990/</a></p>
