      This was not the first time when we were faced with the "borrowing" of our elements or design layouts.  Last time we were helped to find a clone by the guys from <a href="http://hellodesigners.ru/">hellodesigners.ru</a> .  But for us it was a revelation that there is no limit to impudence.  The site Birich.ru was not changed by anything.  Even part of the content (licenses of the KirovCherMet company) remained on the vile chameleon site. <br><br> <a title="Habraffe.ru" href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/e3/d9/e3d9de8fe633e6dccb32a52477579199.jpg"></a> <br><br>  At that moment we decided to launch our small but very proud investigation. <br>  The company's website Birich.ru were copyrighted Saratov company " <a href="http://www.my-masters.ru/">Master-site</a> ."  As the girl on the phone answered us, this site was occupied by their programmer.  It was not easy to find him - with his full name and surname he appeared only in one place.  It was only later that we realized that ‚Äúch.  programmer ‚ÄùEugene and Ivkin IP is one person.  With a nickname, for example, he was found on one of the social bookmarking services with one link to some kind of porn (not really, by the way), but this is not important for us now. <br><br>  In parallel, we called the phones that were listed in contacts on the website birich.ru.  The rooms belonged to a certain company "Lomprom Saratov".  The guys said (or pretended) that they didn‚Äôt even know themselves in the Very Obvious Fir-tree of Great Surprise.  They promised to sort it out.  We also considered it necessary to inform our customer, who was so angry, that he wanted to jump into his Astonmartins and Jaguars and ... go to Saratov.  They calmed down and started thinking about what to do next. <br><br><h3>  What you need to do if you fall into a similar situation: </h3><br><br>  1) Calm down and exhale <br>  2) Go and buy bread to really calm down. <br>  3) Make certified screenshots at the notary. <br>  4) Write a pre-trial claim.  Better with a lawyer.  You can see our claim <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xKytw2xGgW2-GRWDXwEXsdhb0V3cd6i-C1GUtzz5ayQ/edit%3Fhl%3Den">here.</a> <br>  5) If you know any data of the guilty (name, address, etc.), go to the site <a href="http://www.nalog.ru/">www.nalog.ru</a> .  There is access to the base of IP / LLC. <br>  6) According to this data, send a registered letter with a pre-trial claim. <br>  7) Go to the website of the Russian post office and get freaked out that their tracking is updated every 2-3 days. <br>  8) When a notice appears on the website of the mail that the letter has been delivered to the addressee, call back and remind you that the person has 10 days to consider this question after the letter is delivered. <br>  9) If all your requirements are met, sit contentedly, if not - go to court.  The court takes place at the place of residence of the defendant. <br><br>  All our requirements, in essence, were met.  The site Birich.ru does not work anymore, Master-Site has removed it from the portfolio.  The amount that was spelled out in the pre-trial claim is not going to give Ivkin Yevgeny to us, referring to the fact that he doesn‚Äôt have the money, and he is currently liquidating the IP.  However, if legal proceedings have been initiated against SP, it cannot be closed. <br>  What will we do next?  Nothing.  We do not want to go to Saratov and begin judicial proceedings.  We sincerely believe that Boy Eugene understood his mistake.  And money?  And web developers earn money differently. <br><br>  PS: It will be great if you share your experience and advice in solving problems of this kind.  Thank! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/108423/">https://habr.com/ru/post/108423/</a></p>
