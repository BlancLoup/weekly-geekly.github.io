There are two options: <br>  - Make old customers upgrade <br>  - Attract new customers <br><br>  What motivates users in this case?  I think that one of the key positions is ‚Äúto have the latest version is fashionable, all the more everyone knows that the newer version is more reliable and with more functionality‚Äù.  After all, if a firm regularly releases new versions, it means that it takes care of its customers, fixes bugs, improves the interface, improves usability and speed ... In general, everything in the new version of the product is good.  But there is such a problem ... <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  There are different special cases of new versions.  Some people are too addicted to feature lists, they fall ill with a trick and lose some customers who consciously refuse to switch to a newer version due to the fact that the old one is less heavy and not overloaded with excessive functionality.  Remember again ACDSee and Nero.

      Others add features in the measures of permissible, but forget about the file - the immutable rule says that each subsequent version should be no more buggy than the previous one.  Ideally, the glucose should decrease with each new version.  As an example, we give Microsoft, which regularly for various reasons forgets about the file.  Here you can say that what gets away with Microsoft will not get away with you.  Do not repeat their path.  For example, the same Vista was released, the features were added, the design was tweaked, everything is super.  But now "after the assembly process with a file" for a year, and the end-edge is not yet visible. <br>  And there is a third option, when the changes have accumulated enough to announce the new version, they are within reason, so as not to turn into a tick, and the file is remembered firmly.  Let's take the example of another giant, so that Microsoft is not lonely.  Apple  There is a lot of talk about Leopard now.  As it <a href="http://wuff--wuff.blogspot.com/2007/09/leopard-vs-tiger.html">is</a> written <a href="http://wuff--wuff.blogspot.com/2007/09/leopard-vs-tiger.html">here,</a> new <b>explicit</b> features between 10.4.10 and 10.5.0 - only three.  Implicit, "grinding" - a lot more.  It‚Äôs even scary to talk about comparing 10.4.0 and future 10.5.0 - a lot of new functionality has been added to increase the number of the major version.  Of course, I just want to get up to their full height and say out loud - look, do it right!  Clients from such a move will not decrease exactly. <br><br>  Another option about how to do it seems to be correct, but still not worth it, it's IE.  Particularly pleased with the transition from the 6th version to the 7th.  It seems that just someone said: ‚ÄúGuys, if we release whist with the 6th explorer, shame and shame.  Let's get something fast zababahay! ‚ÄùAnd zababahali following major version.  Yes, the design has changed.  And, of course, I am glad that dashed in border styles is displayed as dashed and not dotted.  But to the full adequacy ... well, you all know about it, tea written about this wonderful browser is enough.  So, this is a vivid example of what was done "by the rules."  Bugs fixed, new features added.  But, as you can see, the result still leaves much to be desired. <br><br>  Therefore, if you have at least some independence from the dates and, accordingly, the money does not burn your heels, try not to forget about the file.  For some reason they forget about him more often.  If you don‚Äôt have time to do it in time, then do not forget about the update, which should be released very quickly after the release.  Your quickness in plugging [intentionally] left holes almost always has a positive effect on karma.  The more holes there are, the faster the update should come out so that users forgive you. <br><br>  And finally, if you had the stupidity of promising to include something in the next version, releasing it by the deadline and further along the list - you will have to go ahead and still do it.  Moreover, with minimal deviations from the text of the promise.  If there is an opportunity - better not promise anything at all.  And make an announcement only when you are 100% sure.  It will save your nerves and money to you, and bring joy to customers. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/14459/">https://habr.com/ru/post/14459/</a></p>
