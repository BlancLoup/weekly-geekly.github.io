  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How can a freelancer accept payment from foreign customers?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  When deciding whether to accept payment from a foreign customer, a freelancer needs at a minimum: choose a payment method that will be available to both parties, select a service with an affordable commission and optimal withdrawal conditions.  In the case of the method of payment - the most affordable is payment by card.  Below are a few nuances when accepting payment cards from customers from abroad in Ukraine, as well as our payment solution for freelancers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/50c/7fe/e7b/50c7fee7bdba43dc82f18b971732adb8.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Conversion</b> <br>  According to the legislation of Ukraine, payment is possible only in the national currency.  Therefore, when transferring funds from a foreign card, you must take into account the rate at which the conversion takes place.  Usually, the conversion when writing off funds occurs at the rate of payment systems.  The course is dynamic and may change several times a day.

      <b>Conversion</b> <br>  Not all payment acceptance services work correctly with foreign payments, as a result - part of payments from abroad may be rejected.  Such ‚Äúrefusals‚Äù are related to the fact that, according to the anti-fraud policy, the payment partner, in order to secure the client as much as possible, simply rejects the suspicious payment.  Those who regularly work with foreign partners, this service policy, of course, causes loss to the payee and delivers a number of inconveniences to the payer. <br>  Every freelancer tries to find the best and most profitable option for accepting payments from foreign customers, and we in turn decided to show our version of a payment solution. <br><br>  <a href="https://wayforpay.com/freelance.php">WayForPay Freelance</a> - a freelancer can issue an electronic invoice (invoice) to the customer and send it by mail for online payment.  To pay, the payer needs to click on the link from the letter to go to a secure payment page to enter billing information.  In fact, for the payer, this is just like a regular payment with a purchase card in an online store. <br><br>  The service accepts payments from abroad, and competent work with risky payments is applied.  Payments go through a detailed check, to avoid fraudulent transactions, without automatic rejection of payment. <br><br>  It is possible to form an account in English.  Available currencies for creating an account are UAH, EUR, USD.  Conversion takes place at the rate of payment systems, enrollment takes place in the national currency. <br><br>  To form an invoice, you must specify the name of the product / service, its cost, select the currency and language of email.  accounts.  After creating an account, it will be automatically sent to the specified email address of the payer. <br><br>  In the system it is possible to track payments for all invoices.  It is also possible to set up a notification by mail or SMS when receiving payment. <br><br>  Commission payment service for freelancers - from 2.5% to 2.8%.  The commission is charged only upon successful payment, there are no subscription fees and connection fees. <br>  In addition to invoices, a freelancer can independently create payment buttons and insert them into his website.  This payment option is more acceptable for those who have fixed rates - for example, a freelancer service package, with a certain cost.  The button is formed in the personal account of the WayForPay, when creating the button, the required amount is indicated.  After the button is installed on the site, the payment will occur as in the usual online purchase, when you click on the ‚Äúbuy‚Äù button.
