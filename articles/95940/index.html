And to do this for hours - he is not afraid of high pressure, decompression sickness and hypothermia. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b90/65a/a56/b9065aa56f027d7c2f33532f65e5b4a9.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Increasingly, robots are attracted to the construction, inspection and repair of objects under water.  Such as gas and oil pipelines, submarine cables, oil towers, dams, bridge supports.  Specially created devices are used in the nuclear industry to test and carry out simple work in radioactive water tanks.  And, of course, for a visual inspection of berthing facilities and the bottoms of ships. <br>  In addition, there are international competitions among student teams in underwater robotics, in which the Russian team of students has been successfully performing since 2008. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Intro </h4><br><img src="http://img163.imageshack.us/img163/1024/12680816.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Annual international student competitions in the classroom ROV</i> <br><br>  Over the past decade, interest in the development of uninhabited underwater vehicles has increased incomparably in the world.  This is associated with significant technological progress in the field of underwater robotics and with a significant expansion of the range of tasks solved with the help of underwater vehicles.  Many developed countries, especially those with access to the sea, invest significant financial resources to create their own technical developments in this field. <br><br>  One of the activities in this direction is the search for new technical solutions and the involvement of talented young people in this section of knowledge through the creation of student teams and national and international competitions in different classes of underwater vehicles.  The objectives of the competition are to provide opportunities for talented young people to express themselves, and for professionals to evaluate and pay attention to them.

Initially, the competitions were national, only teams from the USA participated in them, but already in 2006 they were granted international status.  Over the next four years, teams from Canada, Pakistan, Scotland, China, Iran, Japan and Russia came to the competition. <br>  Every year the scale of the competition increases, in 2009 the number of teams that took part in the competitions (including regional ones) exceeded 300. And these are several thousand active students and schoolchildren from around the world who are passionate about underwater robotics. <br><br><h4>  Training team for underwater robotics </h4><br>  A team of students of the FESTU and the Far Eastern State University (IFIT, Department of Underwater Robotics), who had practice at IPMT (Institute of Marine Technology Problems of the Far Eastern Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences), was organized in late 2007.  This team was divided into two parts, one of which was developing the mechanics of the underwater vehicle, and the second - an electronic software package.  Each direction was supervised by experienced mentors from the staff and postgraduate students of MPMT. <br><br><img src="http://img22.imageshack.us/img22/1146/71496988.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Team members in the design and development process of the underwater vehicle</i> <br><br>  Students were given an introductory course on the elementary basics of underwater robotics, which included the following questions: <br>  - types of uninhabited underwater vehicles and the structure of their systems; <br>  - hull system and materials used for it, buoyancy control; <br>  - propulsion and steering complex and energy supply; <br>  - motion control system and navigation underwater vehicles; <br>  - measuring sensors and imaging systems in the information-measuring complex of the underwater vehicle. <br>  In June 2008, the combined student team of Vladivostok with a developed remote-controlled device, called ‚ÄúJunior‚Äù, took part in the international competition ‚ÄúMATE International ROV Competition‚Äù (San Diego, USA) for the first time and was recognized as the best among beginners. overall in the class Explorer ranked 8th out of 28 teams. <br>  In June 2009, the student team represented Russia for the second time at the international student competitions in underwater robotics ‚ÄúMATE International ROV Competition 2009‚Äù (Boston, USA).  In total, 28 teams from 5 countries (USA, Canada, UK, China and Russia) took part in the competition.  The team participated with the reconstructed underwater vehicle ‚ÄúJunior‚Äù and took the fourth place. <br><br><img src="http://img193.imageshack.us/img193/4272/28474051.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Team after the announcement of the results of the competition</i> <br><br><img src="http://img687.imageshack.us/img687/9118/58994596.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Underwater vehicle "Junior"</i> <br><br>  In the video you can see the preparations for the championship and the performance itself. <br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZR3Mg1MNaYQ%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhi_XeRbCEv9cYdeMRZX-r18gCHlMg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Currently, preparations are underway for the MATE International ROV Competition 2010. <br>  This year for participation in competitions the new device "Junior-2" is made.
