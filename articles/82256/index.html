However, it is also impossible to call it a fantastic language.

      It would be great to put each student in the head with a processor and a flash drive to upload a lot of interesting things there.  And the teacher would know for sure what was going on in the student‚Äôs head.  It is a pity that this is a little unreal. <br><br>  And what if the student attach the superstructure to the brain without trepanning the skull?  Let it be some kind of external system that teaches a person and controls his knowledge. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Imagine a large learning site that includes the maximum accumulated knowledge of mankind.  The main task of the site is to share knowledge with the student and remember how well the student learned this knowledge.  Any course, any lesson will require some level of understanding of the subject and will not allow a person who is not familiar with the multiplication table, to climb into higher mathematics. <br><br>  If you have a soul to study biology, do it for months at a time.  No one will force you to solve problems in physics.  There is time for that later.  Development must be natural and enjoyable. <br><br>  To achieve results, the site must contain a knowledge base, training programs and knowledge control programs.  The site will know exactly what and at what level you know.  It will not overload you with information, but it will not be repeated once again.  It will be an upgrade of your brain, will patch holes in your memory, will always be able to prompt something and will make every day of your life a step forward. <br><br>  Imagine learning languages ‚Äã‚Äãwith such a system.  New words are explained to you based on what you already know.  At the same time, the site knows how many words a day you can remember, and does not try to give you more than it should be.  Before watching the film, the site will sort out the subtitles and hold a special lesson where it will tell you about new words and turnovers of speech that you are not familiar with.  He will talk to you, increasing speed, but will not load you with new words, focusing on understanding conversational speech. <br><br>  Either you understand the lesson and you know it perfectly well, or you need something else to chew on.  And the site will do it - it is patient.  Instead of moving to complex geometry theorems for you, the site will achieve a perfect understanding of the fundamentals of science.  He will try a lot of ways, but he will bring you the light of knowledge. <br><br>  I would like to discuss in the comments the complexity of implementing such a system and find out how you feel about such radical innovations.  After all, in fact, I suggest everyone to stick to the ‚Äúmatrix‚Äù for life.  We are no longer able to wean out Wikipedia, let alone talk about more complex and more ‚Äúuser-integrated‚Äù projects.  If something remains unclear, I‚Äôm happy to add it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/82256/">https://habr.com/ru/post/82256/</a></p>
