Nevertheless, this is only the beginning, we have a lot of ideas, there are also a lot of products planned and all, without exception, will carry on board the unique "chips" of their own design. <br>  So - what is Gametrix and why did we come up with it?

      Until now, all companies operating in the computer peripheral market implemented the same business model - OEM manufacturing.  Roughly it looks like this: go to the exhibition - choose a product - go to the factory - stick your brand on the product - ‚Äúpush‚Äù the Chinese (Taiwanese, Korean ets) supplier at a price - send the goods to Russia - advertise the brand - ‚Äúdownload‚Äù it in retail - sell until the buyer does not cease to satisfy the price / functionality / quality ets.  Then the cycle repeats. <br>  Today it is the pinnacle of Russian distribution. <br><br>  The problem with this approach is that the distributor (and the buyer) are forced to ‚Äúhave something to give‚Äù - what a foreign designer has developed, you will get it.  And if you don‚Äôt like something, it‚Äôs your personal problem, go find where it‚Äôs better, haha, or prepare big money ... I think I won‚Äôt discover America if I say that many solutions by Asian engineers are far from even average and they are actively ‚Äúshoved‚Äù to us only because of their low price, they are beneficial for the distributor and retailers, but at the same time, who thought about the final buyer?  Surprisingly, in our market, the interests of the end customer are of little concern to anyone. <br><br>  We want to try a slightly different model. <br><br>  <b>At the first stage</b> - the search for "bottlenecks" in the electronics of standard models of gaming devices, the use of its own electronic solutions to improve performance.  The reason for starting it from the electronics is banal - this is the most low-cost way. <br><br>  <b>At the second stage</b> - elimination of ‚Äúbottlenecks‚Äù in constructive solutions of standard models of gaming devices.  This is more expensive, because  requires the development of their own molds for plastic parts, and they are very expensive.  But since  we change only a part of the elements, then we spend not so much money.  Those.  at the second stage, we get the Russian-Chinese "hybrids" - the most important Russian nodes, electronics t.zh.  our. <br><br>  <b>In the third stage,</b> we collect devices completely Russian development.  Those.  We no longer use the molds of Chinese factories, we do not use their electronic solutions.  This is still a dream (although several models have already been developed to the level of prototypes).  The problem, as you know, is money.  For example, a set of molds for our first model, the Gametrix Viper, costs $ 120,000 (we recall using someone else‚Äôs molds), and the model, as you see, is not constructively complex.  What to say about the price of molds for more advanced models. <br><br>  Actually, in this blog I will talk about how we move through these stages, what problems we face, what ideas we have, what we succeed and what not, I will consult with you, somewhere, maybe, to brag, but somewhere to complain, and, of course, to answer questions! <br>  I really hope that our team will attract your attention.  As I wrote above, I‚Äôm the project manager, 2 more main engineers work with me, 2 involved in certain tasks, and of course there is a marketing department, who invented to open this blog.  Well, and above us is an investor who stifles our beautiful outbursts, severely demanding a return on investment and cutting budgets. <br>  I think we will have something to talk about.  Our specialization is devices for interacting with computer games, and I can talk about them for a long time and, I hope, interesting.  True, a trade secret will often silence me, so in places I will not say everything. <br>  In general, with the introductory word you can finish, write, ask, talk. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/79651/">https://habr.com/ru/post/79651/</a></p>
