  <section class="page js-page"><h1>PS3 Wireless Controller Overview</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The gamepad, which is also the controller, which is also the joystick, is the most important part of the PlayStation, which has an incomparable value for the gamer.  After all, the controller is exactly the thread that connects the player with an alternate reality, allowing you to control a virtual alter ego on the screen of your monitor, and temporarily transform from a quiet and modest representative of the middle class to a bloodthirsty cosmo paratrooper or an 80th-level elf.  In our review, we look at the most successful controllers for PS3, created by leading companies - developers gaming devices. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/e6fc6590/8bdbcbe2/e19ed354/cc8cdf29.jpg"><br><br>  It opens with a review of the PS3's DualShock 3 controller that comes with each new console, for which Sony received an Emmy award in 2007 for ‚Äúdeveloping peripherals and the impact on gaming controllers technology.‚Äù  Although outwardly, the gamepad is a pronounced heir to its predecessors - Sony's console controllers of the previous generation - DualShock 1 and DualShock 2, thanks to its low weight, sensitive buttons, ‚Äúsmart‚Äù vibration system and SIXAXIS tricky technology that allows you to recognize movements in space (be prepared for that that in some games it is necessary to ‚Äúshake‚Äù the gamepad), it represents the true quintessence of the latest generation technologies.  Due to the thoughtful design, the joystick is equally comfortable both in the child‚Äôs hand and in the lap of a two-meter heavyweight athlete.  On components, Sony traditionally does not save: the material of the controller body, buttons and sticks is designed for long-term and active use.  The functionality of the device is quite versatile and optimized for games of any genre: from shooters and RPGs to racing and fighting games.  This gamepad has only one drawback - its price.  However, for the quality and absolute compatibility, it is not a pity to give an extra thousand rubles. <br><br>  The best game that maximizes the potential of the controller is Killzone 3. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/121c1816/0de11bf8/36cac854/640130e5.jpg"><br>  The company's gamepad - Thrustmaster Wireless 430 Scuderia Limited Edition is styled as a Ferrari racing supercar: stylish ergonomic design and signature colors of the Maranello stables are organically combined with advanced technologies from one of the leaders in the global industry of console and computer peripherals.  You can‚Äôt go wrong if you assume that with such a controller it is especially good to play racing simulators: the gamepad is really ‚Äúsharpened‚Äù for races and is designed primarily for those fans who, for some reason, have not yet acquired one of the company steering wheels, Thrustmaster‚Äôs pride.  The rough coating allows you to conveniently and securely hold the controller in your hands, and the optical ring around the crosspiece rotates (with auto centering) by 90 degrees, which is especially convenient in motorsport competitions.  However, in the shooters and fighters, this device also does not lose face: the gamepad has a rather long stroke, which has a positive effect on accuracy, and the metal base of the sticks will prevent them from prematurely disabling the brutality practitioners at Mortal Kombat.  For fans of the game on the verge of cheating on the back of the joystick, there are two buttons that can be programmed under the "combo" in fighting games or firing bursts of Mosin rifles in the shooters of the Second World War.

      The best game that maximizes the potential of the controller - Grand Turismo 4. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/fcc7dad3/95338bb4/ee616fda/8b628172.jpg"><br>  The output of a custom wireless gamepad from Mad Catz was timed to release one of the most popular games of 2009 - Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, and therefore it is logical to assume that its main purpose is military shooters.  Veterans of the cantilever special forces will surely like his camouflage design and handles made of material similar to that on the handles of pistols and assault rifles of the American army.  In general, the full effect of the presence in the "hot spot" players provided.  Another positive feature of the gamepad from ‚Äúcrazy pussies‚Äù is its operation at a frequency of 2.4Ghz, which, according to the developers, guarantees gamers ‚Äúanti-lag‚Äù protection.  The device also contains additional keys that can be ‚Äúzabindit‚Äù under poluchitersky combinations. <br><br>  The best game that maximizes the potential of the controller, as you probably already guessed - Call of Duty: Moder Warfare 2. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/a6615fd3/e4671157/53d97802/17b5c2c2.png"><br>  Gamepad from Logitech differs minimalist design, convenience and ergonomics.  At the same time, it, like the Mad Catz controller, works at 2.4Ghz frequency (which means it is especially good for shooters), has a rotating spider (and, therefore, will not get lost in fighting games) and is a pretty good alternative to DualShock 3 for those who set out to save.  However, to me personally, its stylish, but somewhat unusual design seemed a bit uncomfortable.  However, this is my special case and it can hardly be considered indicative, because the friends from this joystick are absolutely delighted. <br><br>  The best game that maximizes the potential of the controller - in general, any shooter, but I tested it on Battlefield: Bad Company 2. Offset. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/8d34b3c4/6af42b91/12095399/2efb28ca.jpg"><br>  Closes our hit parade wireless turbo gamepad from the company Wildfire.  Although from the point of view of design and the materials used in its creation, it is clearly not for the better different from its rivals, due to the rather low price and, consequently, a good price / quality ratio, this controller still managed to get into our shortlist.  Turbo buttons - what more do economical fans of fights and shooters need? <br><br>  The best game that maximizes the potential of the controller is Street Fighter IV. <br><br>  Summary: although Sony still has no equal in the all-around of the original DualShock 3, highly specialized gamers may well opt for the models presented for review.  They all deserve it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/125861/">https://habr.com/ru/post/125861/</a></p>
