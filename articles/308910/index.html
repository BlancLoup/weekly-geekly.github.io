  <section class="page js-page"><h1>By September 1st post: hosting for a social project and PR of public organizations</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello! <br>  On this wonderful day of knowledge, we want to talk about a social project in which we participate.  For more than a year now we have been providing free hosting for the public organization ‚ÄúThe Modern World of Youth‚Äù.  We want to talk about why we help public organizations and who exactly helps my company.  And also under the cut a few words about the specifics of PR and the information strategy of public organizations. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bba/95e/d08/bba95ed089924e38a1095e0d056dba07.png"><br><br>  There are many problems with charitable and other public organizations, but the most important of them is non-transparency.  When the dude comes to the meeting at the last Mercy from the youth sports organization, and you are casually asking: do you work somewhere else?  - says - no - (i.e., gives the whole soul to children) - think about the meaning and purpose of such organizations, which are designed to help someone to <s>cut the loot</s> .  Such institutions can not fatten, if fattening - it means something is not right.  Also disgusting aunt from the social security office coming to retirees in mink coats. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  There is never any money </h1><br>  In NGOs, very often there is no money, and every penny in the account, I began my work in a public organization, so I know what I'm talking about.  It's one thing when we work at 0 and there are objective expenses to help someone, and another thing is when they are still trying to make money on it.  This is no good when they also try to make money on volunteers, they still take money in spite of everything - the same web studios, for example, or hosters.  I believe that you can not take money where people give money not for someone to earn, but for helping someone.

    <h1>  Competent information strategy for such organizations is the key to success. </h1><br>  <b>Why is a normal site (without crashing) very important for any NGO?</b> <br>  It happens that you go to a site of any HO and you see that the site is on Ukoz, a lot of advertising (even sex shops - and the organization helps children, for example), and often the sites are hacked, it‚Äôs not clear what is hanging, etc.  The information channel is very important for these organizations, since it is the pulse of their life - if nothing is done (and it is not told about it) - it is not there, if there is no communication with the public - then what kind of public organization is this?  If they are not in the information space - they are not there at all, and you can‚Äôt explain to anyone that it was not us who put advertising on the prostitutes on our charity‚Äôs website. <br><br>  And, of course, reputation is another very important aspect of the work of such organizations, so they should value their reputation so that anyone who gave them even a penny has the opportunity to go in and see where his money went. <br><br><h1>  Why do we help these guys? </h1><br>  This <a href="http://ssm.in.ua/">ssm.in.ua</a> organization, which my company provides free hosting, aims to help young people.  It often happens that the current youth is not needed by anyone.  And often this part of the population is ignored by the public - it seems that young people do not exist, but they exist, and if they are not engaged, they will do anything but work.  People from various professions came to my school and told me about their work.  Why was this done?  To show the children that there is life behind their school, and it is not at a dirty stop, or a staircase, but in work and creation. <br><br>  The current youth is isolated from real life in their schools / institutes and contacts / smartphones - for them, life is emasculated.  And after school, they don‚Äôt know where to put themselves, they don‚Äôt understand how to build their lives, go with the flow, are at a loss after graduation (and after the institute too) and they rush for fashion trends: that‚Äôs why we have a bunch of economists and lawyers and other managers who somehow finished their studies at the university (where outdated knowledge is taught) go out as a prisoner after his release, who needs rehabilitation and socialization and go to work for anyone (I also received an unnecessary education :). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2b7/623/d0c/2b7623d0cb53477b8b6000dc7bd3b243.png"><br><br>  And the task of this particular GO is to help young people, and the very first thing is to help with work - after all, everyone knows that the first job is the most difficult, and you don‚Äôt choose it - and she‚Äôs you. <br><br>  For example, over the past month they arranged 180 students - a very good result, I think.  And, moreover, they also work according to the principles - a) so that the profession is at least somehow in terms of the profile of study, b) official employment, c) they should ensure that the student is not offended after finding a job.  They do a lot of other things - you can read more here - <a href="http://ssm.in.ua/">ssm.in.ua</a> or here: <a href="http://ssm.in.ua/projects/">ssm.in.ua/projects</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/18d/372/9b7/18d3729b76a54869bc98327acdeb738e.png"><br><br>  <b>Why help non-governmental organizations?</b> <br>  The hosting company has a reserve of its capacities that are not used, so why not give them for free use to organizations that help others? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3c2/39f/561/3c239f56172a450db6879f34c5fb8fbb.png"><br><br>  In addition, these guys, specifically Vladislav Shchelokov, who came to visit, is a member of the public council under the Ministry of Education of Ukraine and monitor those bills in the field of education that very much influence the social and legal atmosphere in the field of education, as well as in Ukraine whole <br><br>  When assisting such projects, a mailing list is made once a year - whether or not to extend the hosting of the site ‚Äî for what?  In order to find out - is the project alive or not?  Because, after all, nothing lasts forever - today there is a project, but there is no tomorrow, and it happens that the hosting of such sites may contain no one knows what (the project is closed, and something else is hosted there) - this is why we are doing this control letter. <br><br>  Not only can my company help with hosting social networking sites, help is also possible with the site itself.  For example, the development department developed an e-petition website for free, and it was already done, but for some reason they decided (or something else happened) that this site is no good, ordered the site from other contractors, it came out later, not at the right time, looked like worse, but this is another social problem, or karma, which can be any, even good social projects. <br><br>  Therefore, let us say once again that for their karma, the image of public organizations is very important, and it is made up of so many trifles: the website, the texts (their style), what they say, how they say they undertake, how they evaluate public importance, how transparent their processes are. how to report etc.  And hosting a public organization site is also a very significant part of the infrastructure of such GOs.  Not to mention the fact that this is part of their information presence, the importance of which I spoke above. <br><br><blockquote><h1>  About schools </h1><br>  As Vladislav told us, everything is difficult with schools, at the conversation level everything is fine, the management seems to be ready to work, but when you call: let's do something, we have exams, we have holidays, yes we have graduation, etc. d.  and after 20 calls, the desire to do something disappears.  This may expose another social problem: school authorities act according to the worst ‚Äúscenario of officials‚Äù - when only IBD benefits them and nothing more will be said (not by September 1 :).  Before, yes, they didn‚Äôt demand anything from the school, and they couldn‚Äôt really demand it, since it was more free than it is now, but now that it‚Äôs not very free (I‚Äôm speaking as a father of two schoolchildren), now parents begin to demand from the schools of some kind of service, and responsibility for the services provided.  That is, it‚Äôs not only money, it‚Äôs all about resources (not necessarily money) and the desire to work - and only those who really work and want to work, only need help. </blockquote><br><br>  There are other social projects in which my company participates ( <a href="https://www.sim-networks.com/blog/odfond-project">here</a> , for example), I will also talk about them in our blog. <br><br>  <i>Information technology must change life for the better!</i> <br><br>  P.S.  If any public organizations that need hosting, then here are our contacts, write: <a href="https://www.sim-networks.com/contact">www.sim-networks.com/contact</a> <br>  UPD: embarrassing image of some readers removed </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/308910/">https://habr.com/ru/post/308910/</a></p>
