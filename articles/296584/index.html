  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Tele2 was the first among the “big four” operators to launch the sale of SIM-cards in the “Yulmart” online store</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A new section “tariffs and sim cards” will appear on the website of the Ulmart online store.  Such an unusual expansion of the product range is connected with the agreement that <a href="http://ru.tele2.ru/">Tele2</a> operator has concluded with the online retailer.  Starting from December 2015, residents of Moscow and the region will be able to connect to the Tele2 network through the Yulmart online store.  Visitors can choose a number and a tariff plan on the store’s website. <br><br>  Tele2 will work with an online retailer in a revenue-sharing scheme (sharing part of the revenue from a connected subscriber), a Tele2 representative said.  The head of the program of projects “Digital goods and payment services” of Yulmarth, Mikhail Daikhin, said that in the first month from the start of sales it is planned to implement more than 10 thousand Tele2 contracts. <br><br>  The cost of attracting through alternative sales channels for the Big Three operators is now on average about 200 rubles per subscriber, the source of Vedomosti calculated. <a name="habracut"></a>

Tele2 traditionally pays a lot of attention to sales in the “non-core” channels for the cellular market, Prokshin confirms.  This allows the company to organize the widest possible sales network within walking distance from potential customers and in the most visited places. <br><br>  About 50% of all Tele2 connections traditionally account for their own retail network, Prokshin said.  According to him, Tele2 has the highest cost of attracting one subscriber (SAC) in its own retail network and in networks of federal cellular retailers, and the lowest - from local partners and in the operator’s own online store. <br><br>  On October 22, Tele2 was launched in Moscow.  Since the official launch, Tele2 SIM cards can be purchased at approximately 10-11 thousand different retail outlets.  According to Prokshin, the structure of sales of new contracts in Moscow will be similar to the structure of sales throughout Russia: the company plans that about 45-50% of all connections will fall on a mono-brand network.  A year after the launch of the network, Tele2 can count on 10% of the market in terms of the number of active SIM cards, the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/UBS">UBS</a> Bank report said. <br><br>  In addition to Tele2, Yulmart intends to start working with all the Big Three operators by the end of Q1 2016, Daikhin said.  Cooperation with operators is part of the transition from the classic online store selling goods to selling including digital services.  “We need to comprehensively meet customer needs in order to sell not only mobile communication devices, but also mobile communication itself,” he explains. <br><br>  The share of online sales of operators' contracts is still insignificant, says Telecommunications Director of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25B2%25D1%258F%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B9_(%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F)">Svyaznoy,</a> Daniel Pokolodny.  The “top four operators” and <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2595%25D0%25B2%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D1%258C">“Euroset”</a> with “Svyaznoy” together account for more than 17 thousand retail outlets, they are within walking distance in most cities of Russia, he notes. <br><br>  The online channel has great potential, but now it is more effective for certain services — for example, ordering a “beautiful number”, Mr. Pokolodny believes. <br><br>  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B0%25D0%25A4%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD">Megafon</a> is negotiating with Yulmart, the operator’s representative confirmed.  However, MegaFon most actively attracts subscribers through its own stores, which account for about a third of the contracts sold. <br><br>  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25A2%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25A1%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D1%258B">MTS</a> for these purposes has its own online store, as well as an agreement with the site <a href="http://www.ozon.ru/">Ozon.ru</a> (the operator owns 10.8% of the online hypermarket).  The share of the Internet channel in the connections is small, says operator spokesman Dmitry Solodovnikov.  However, since the beginning of the year, sales of MTS sim cards in its own online store have increased 7 times. <br><br>  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2592%25D1%258B%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB-%25D0%259A%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BC%25D1%2583%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8">Vimpelcom</a> considers sales in consumer electronics channels to be promising, its representative Anna Aybasheva <a href="http://www.vedomosti.ru/technology/articles/2015/11/20/617619-tele2-naidet-abonentov-cherez-yulmart">told</a> Vedomosti.  She recalled that since 2014, the company has been selling through the Ulmart a mobile Internet tariff plan for a tablet. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296584/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296584/</a></p>
