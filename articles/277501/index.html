Our <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/instreamatic/blog/276567/">first</a> blog post caused a lively discussion.  We expected a storm to break out, but its scale turned out to be enormous.  Our team has received many questions that are interesting, really deserve attention and require clarification, since the topic of audio advertising involves three sides: the user, the developer, and the advertiser.  When everyone is interested, the game must be fair and any omissions is an obstacle to work.  So, we answer. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/960/967/265/9609672656df40589920b2d1fbf8bd24.jpg"></div><br>  <font color="#808080"><i>Poster of 1927 on the effectiveness of advertising in the tram</i></font> <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  <font color="#d4145a">Gallop on</font> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/195/0f9/1df/1950f91df28f4c839f8c50f272dc5111.png">  <b>Advertising can be placed only in music and radio?</b>  <b>Where does the playback start?</b>

      Advertising is possible in any audio stream (game sounds, conversation, music, radio, voice chat, etc.) In which place the audio advertising will be turned on, the developer himself (the site owner) decides.  A commercial can be played between tracks or playlists or, for example, in an online radio stream by broadcast labels (DTMF tags), which signal that it‚Äôs appropriate to insert an advertisement ‚Äî the instreamatic server listens to the stream and sends a signal to all customers when it detects a tag.  After that, targeting and advertising is performed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/195/0f9/1df/1950f91df28f4c839f8c50f272dc5111.png">  <b>Will audio ads interrupt the track in the middle?</b> <br><br>  Advertising can not be played in the middle of a song, conversation, an important game episode, and so on.  Intrimatic adjusts this issue at the stage of inclusion of the site in our network.  Obviously, neither the advertiser, nor the user, nor the site is interested in the format that interrupts the content in half a word.  We work very closely with the developers of each product to ensure that the appearance of audio advertising is as organic and non-invasive as possible. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/195/0f9/1df/1950f91df28f4c839f8c50f272dc5111.png">  <b>We know, advertising will be included in complete silence and wake me / a child or sleep at work in front of colleagues.</b> <br><br>  We noticed that this fear was repeatedly repeated in the comments.  As Internet users, we perfectly understand the problem - however, it is unpleasant when there is a strange loud sound on the websites or in the applications.  No, in case of placement of commercials through <a href="http://instreamatic.com/">Intrimatic,</a> advertising will never be reproduced in complete silence without a sound stream.  We analyze the fact of sound reproduction.  There will be no sudden loud sounds, audio ads will not start in silence. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/195/0f9/1df/1950f91df28f4c839f8c50f272dc5111.png">  <b>And yet, is the sound embedded in the process or is it a ‚Äúleft advertising sound‚Äù?</b> <br><br>  Sound is built into sound.  As on the radio, background music is slowly extinguished, one advertising audio clip sounds, background music, voice, game sounds, etc. comes back.  Display advertising does not occur randomly, it is always tied to the event and the developer is responsible for it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/195/0f9/1df/1950f91df28f4c839f8c50f272dc5111.png">  <b>Will there be a visual blocking, for example, while watching a video or a game (timer, banner)?</b> <br><br>  As we have already written, the audio clip can be accompanied with a synchronous or delayed visual banner.  Banner, even if it is provided, you can close and continue to interact with the content.  However, we note that half of the placements are ordered without a banner. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/195/0f9/1df/1950f91df28f4c839f8c50f272dc5111.png">  <b>Will the volume of the advertisement be adjusted or will it be louder than the content?</b> <br><br>  The answer is simple: advertising will never be louder than content. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/195/0f9/1df/1950f91df28f4c839f8c50f272dc5111.png">  <b>Will the content fall off after listening to the audio track?</b> <br><br>  No, there will be no freezes of the main content.  Video and audio playback is not required again. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/195/0f9/1df/1950f91df28f4c839f8c50f272dc5111.png">  <b>Who will control the content for violations of the law?</b>  <b>Will there be age restrictions (if a child is playing / listening to the radio)?</b> <br><br>  Age restrictions are configured by targets.  All companies in the advertising chain are obliged to comply with the law: advertisers, agencies and we, as a distributor of advertising. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/195/0f9/1df/1950f91df28f4c839f8c50f272dc5111.png">  <b>What type of advertising is an <a href="http://instreamatic.com/">Intrimatic</a> ?</b> <br><br>  Classic RTB auction plus programmatic.  RTB auctions are a great opportunity to optimize purchases and sales of advertising, but audio work has been slowed down for a long time due to the lack of accepted standards in this area.  Throughout 2015, the situation has moved from the dead point.  Developed by AIB format DAAST 1.0, allows you to expect in the coming months the release of DAAST-compatible audio players.  The new version of the OpenRTB protocol (version 2.4 DRAFT) provides for the possibility of a bid request with the type of Audio advertising described in the DAAST format.  Instreamatic is currently busy implementing such a solution and searching for partners for programmatic auction type solutions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/195/0f9/1df/1950f91df28f4c839f8c50f272dc5111.png">  <b>They live free radio, so you can no ads?</b> <br><br>  If the advertisement is not played in your stream, it does not mean that the radio does not have it at all.  For example, there may be an advertisement for listeners from individual countries, or an advertisement for a given number of flow listeners.  You can also earn money on lotteries, prize draws from sponsors, paid order for music content, changes in sound quality, etc.  Yes, for a solid radio station this is not an income - the costs are hundreds of times more.  But for a private person, the owner of an Internet radio who has invested a minimum in the creation of a radio (thanks to various platforms), this is a normal additional income. <br>  In addition, the radio may be secretly sponsored by a company or public institutions as a social order. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#d4145a">A little about the mechanics of Intrimatika</font> </h2><br>  Of course, the mechanics are responsible for the code embedded in the code of the site for the placement of the rollers.  For example, there is a track end event, a stream start, or any other event suitable for a commercial.  It is attached to the display of advertising.  Let's give a couple of examples of implementation. <br>  We agree with the developer about the moment of the launch of advertising, and write it in the code that we pass on to it for installation. <br>  The developer himself sets up the event to display advertising in accordance with the documentation.  For example, for the Web SDK to run in manual mode, you need to pass the parameter admanMode = AdMan.Mode.MANUAL.  However, the playerType and playerId parameters are not required. <br><br>  Advertising is launched by calling the start method on an AdMan.Manager instance. <br>  For adNone and adCompleted events, you need to start the main playback.  Something like this: <br><br><pre><code class="javascript hljs">&lt;button <span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span></span></span></span>=<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"play_button"</span></span>&gt;Play&lt;button&gt; &lt;div id="banner_container"&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;script type="text/javascript" src="adman.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt; var adman = new AdMan.Manager({ admanId: [172, 263], admanMode: AdMan.Mode.MANUAL, banner: { id: "banner_container", width: 728, height: 90 }, events: { adNone: function() { // start player // $("#player").play(); }, adCompleted: function() { // start player // $("#player").play(); } } }); $(".play_button").click(function() { adman.start(); }); &lt;/script&gt;</code> </pre> <br>  On Android devices, the system analyzes whether it is possible to select advertising for the user.  If the video matches the target, the module changes its state.  When the module is in the READY_FOR_PLAYBACK state, you can start playing advertising: <br><br><pre> <code class="javascript hljs">adman.play();</code> </pre><br>  Generally, the Intrimatik is easy to install and manage.  For developers, we have excellent documentation and SDK for various platforms: WEB, Android, iOS, Unity game engine. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#d4145a">Cases of our partners</font> </h2><br>  It was all a dry theory, we are ready to talk about our partners who have connected to the Intrimatic network and have already accumulated traffic data.  The most interesting and illustrative cases are online radio services that have a large audience. <br><br>  In October 2014, the popular service 101.ru connected to us.  On the chart you can see the dynamics of its traffic for several months, including the month of connection.  As you can see, the traffic did not fall, but on the contrary, it even increased. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f94/911/123/f94911123e85474880580725522e1964.png"></div><br>  LOVE RADIO connected to Intrimatik in December 2015 and the graph also shows an increase in traffic (for example, the number of visitors in December compared to November increased by 2.5%), with the exception of a weekly holiday failure not related to advertising. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8e6/983/594/8e698359479042dcace02bc82c0ddddb.png"></div><br>  The popular online radio aggregator Moskva.fm connected to the Intrimat in October 2014 and traffic also continued to grow.  Since in the spring of 2015 the service limited its functionality, the Liveinternet schedule is difficult to perceive visually.  We built it on the partner‚Äôs public data: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1b1/736/d80/1b1736d80afc4f8793fcee9d1589138a.png"></div><br>  We gave examples of those clients for whom open statistics are available.  We work with other platforms and developers no less successfully, but commercial ethics, unfortunately, does not allow us to disclose the results of cooperation. <br><br>  Many questions were asked about the quality of advertising, about what kind of content it is, how much it costs by itself.  We invite you to listen to our clients' audio clips. <br><br>  That's how audio advertising uses the well-known Spotifay on the desktop: <br><br><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/139473493&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiy5hSYoz1W70R12ItUYbUMisFjLQ" width="498" height="315" frameborder="0" title="Spotify Advertising" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  A cool example of Zvooq in a mobile application: <br><br><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/146416547&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhg1dgGK7LdlaVjZ1c5osWljDeEzfQ" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" title="Zvooq Advertising" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Here's how to use it in games: <br><br><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/139479482&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhFTQbQh1d7jm92D4XSuP0ArO8jDQ" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" title="Instreamatic Gameplay [Banner Skip]" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  For those who are ready for a little trash, we have made an IKEA audio clip.  He lies <a href="">here</a> . <br><br>  Advertising do not like.  It is difficult to determine whose fault it is: the advertiser, the manufacturer of the advertisement or the owner of the site.  But at the same time, people love brands and even become evgelists.  Most likely, it is a matter of correctly combining the values ‚Äã‚Äãof the brand, the quality of the advertisement and the appropriateness of its appearance.  But it is advertising that allows owners and developers of free games, websites, useful and necessary applications to earn.  Part of the earnings goes to finalize the product, adding new features and functionality at the request of users.  Advertising ceases to be the engine of commerce and turns into the engine of development of the products that we use.  We do not think that listening to 15-30 seconds of audio advertising is a great price. <br><br>  And, as always, developers are welcome to join the <a href="http://instreamatic.com/">Intrimatic</a> ! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/277501/">https://habr.com/ru/post/277501/</a></p>
