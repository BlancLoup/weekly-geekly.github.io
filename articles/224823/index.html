At the end of 2012, as director of the <a href="http://fbk.info/">Foundation for</a> Combating <a href="http://fbk.info/">Corruption</a> , I, among other Foundation employees, organized a second fundraising for <a href="http://rospil.info/">RosPil</a> , where we made a number of promises regarding the development of the Foundation‚Äôs information system, for which we should have reported for a long time. <br><br>  RosPil is the first truly successful public project in Russia, the logo of which, incidentally, was <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25EE%25F1%25CF%25E8%25EB">invented by an anonymous user Habr</a> , and <a href="https://twitter.com/senko">Pavel Senko</a> also created a website for Ruby.  The essence of the project is to conduct formal legal investigations of suspicious purchases with zakupki.gov.ru by contacting government agencies and giving publicity to the results.

I wanted to refuse to use Googledocs for publishing documents, instead loading them into a special system, where the connection between requests and responses to them, as well as documents belonging to one ‚Äúcase‚Äù will be monitored.  Thus, it will not be possible to forget about any matters, it will always be seen that everything is brought to the end and not abandoned.  A place will appear where you can look at the activities of the entire Foundation and each lawyer in a historical perspective in a convenient and accessible way. <br><br>  That is why the <a href="http://rospil.info/news/p/1799">request for money</a> ( <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/ros-pil/2011-2012-15696503">working link to the full presentation</a> , see slide 25) included the creation of such an information system.  As well as a promise to disclose it to other lawyers and organizations.  Fundraising was successful, they collected more than ten million rubles and FBK really developed such a system under my leadership as the director of the fund and the product manager.  About a <b>million rubles</b> was spent on it and I feel obliged to officially share the money made with public money.  All code and designs are licensed under an open license Creative Commons ( <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/">Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International</a> ), which is reflected in the agreements with the Foundation signed by Alexey. <br><br>  So I have a teaser about what happened, so that it would be interesting for you to read further.  The source code, all designs are published below, the main entities and development plans of the system are described.  And, of course, thanks to the authors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a1f/40b/81a/a1f40b81a00b8e60390308532d9a254d.png" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Current system version and basic concepts </h4><br>  Unfortunately, the Foundation did not fully implement the system, although Aleksey even gave references to several investigations.  The current version with several inquiries of the Foundation can be found here: <a href="http://kbk.fbk.info/investigations">kbk.fbk.info/investigations</a> .  The following basic entities are available to an unauthorized user: <br><br><h5>  To-do list </h5><br>  List of all published cases of the fund.  Visible to the essence of where addressed when the last time.  For authorized there are all sorts of filters and other logical (see designs below).  <a href="http://kbk.fbk.info/">kbk.fbk.info</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/039/334/cb2/039334cb29e9df8bcd27a9bdf9d1805e.png" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  Case page </h5><br>  The hierarchy of documents of the case, where you can see who went where, how they answered, the connection of documents and the result.  <a href="http://kbk.fbk.info/investigations/64">kbk.fbk.info/investigations/64</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e6b/322/a21/e6b322a21d4e203b791159a82d31a62a.png" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  Separate document </h5><br>  All the details of the document, including the scan of the paper itself, so that you can read.  <a href="http://kbk.fbk.info/documents/452">kbk.fbk.info/documents/452</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/700/0bf/fb2/7000bffb2a365d719cc6c926bac14476.png" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  New design and second version </h4><br>  The first version of the system was designed to automate the work of the Foundation and more effective interaction of lawyers with Alexey and other employees.  The second version was developed with an eye to the full publication, discussion and sharing of affairs on the Internet.  The main difficulty here is due to the fact that high-profile investigations cannot be published immediately, because  the PR occasion disappears and the idea can be stolen by competitors, or preventively corrected by the authorities, so the case is first conducted inside, then published, then supplemented.  In addition, document scans contain passport data and other personal information of correspondence participants who need to be hidden when they are published, but remain accessible within. <br><br>  The second version is in the form of fully developed design layouts of all pages and most of the code.  It did not work out just to lay out and pull.  The full archive with layouts in psd is here: <a href="http://yadi.sk/d/HIcMaErcRsLL4">yadi.sk/d/HIcMaErcRsLL4</a> , and below I want to show a few basic innovations.  By the way, the overall design is also modernized. <br><br><h5>  Version of the case page for publication </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/360/43a/b28/36043ab28563a72432eb0b874096e9db.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h6>  Comments </h6><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8ae/3bd/ac2/8ae3bdac28c503d181e286c9f4f994c2.png" alt="image"><br><br><h6>  Popup for document preview </h6><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/50d/2ab/582/50d2ab582a2269bd3d09913f8eb8f28e.png" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  A document page with options to cover your personal and highlight important. </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/85b/b04/689/85bb046897862dac932fd85dbb331e3d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  Download videos and photos </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/530/040/e6b/530040e6b23a713e936582c60d48e922.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h6>  Video </h6><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3bc/5bb/2d1/3bc5bb2d18e680ab11596ee41a100fdb.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The <a href="http://yadi.sk/d/HIcMaErcRsLL4">full archive contains</a> about 20 screens, with filters, all states, preparation for publication and other authorizations and error pages.  In fact, a fully developed product interface. <br><br><h4>  Source </h4><br>  I do not know what to say, because  I myself am an expert on .NET development, I don‚Äôt understand anything in the ruby ‚Äã‚Äãcode. <br><br>  The code is here: <a href="https://github.com/fbkinfo/kbk">github.com/fbkinfo/kbk</a> .  The code is covered with tests, an automatic build is set up with their run on travis-ci and the codeclimate is connected.  Attached deployment instructions.  Questions can be addressed directly to the authors (see below), I think no one will refuse to help. <br><br><h4>  Ideas and perspectives of use </h4><br>  Plans for the following versions were as follows: <br><br><ul><li>  To enable third-party users and organizations to upload their investigations (with moderation and expertise) and make an investigation tape </li><li>  Add geolocation to organizations and cases to reflect this on the map and replace the RosPil site </li><li>  Combine on this basis RosPil, RosYamu and RosZhKH (pit and porch is a special case) </li><li>  To develop the functionality of template investigations and answers, having automated typical replies on roads, entrances and not only </li><li>  Create an online catalog of organizations and activists of civil society leading such cases with ratings </li><li>  Create an online directory of specific officials and organizations that write responses with ratings </li><li>  Open data through api </li></ul><br>  I think the direction is clear.  In an endless perspective, perhaps, this could even be monetized, by selling, for example, to the state, as the basis for a normal feedback system and appeals to officials of all levels.  But most importantly, it would allow to solve much more specific tasks than single, albeit very resonant investigations. <br><br><h4>  Authors and thanks </h4><br>  I want to express many thanks to everyone who took part in this interesting project and made it possible: <br><br><ul><li>  Design: <a href="http://simplesampler.com/">simplesampler.com</a> , as well as <a href="http://slavetski.com/">Cyril</a> and Inna personally </li><li>  Development: <a href="http://evilmartians.ru/">evilmartians.ru</a> , <a href="https://www.facebook.com/yaroslav.markin">Yaroslav</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/shatrov">Kira</a> personally </li><li>  Food consultations: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/nfilippov">Nikita Filippova</a> from <a href="http://scrumtrek.ru/">scrumtrek.ru</a> </li><li>  RosPil lawyers and other FBK employees </li><li>  <a href="http://ilyabirman.ru/">Ilya Birman</a> from the <a href="http://artgorbunov.ru/">bureau</a> for the very <a href="http://fbk.info/investigations/chechnya.html">first concept of the</a> investigation </li><li>  And, of course, Alexei Navalny, as the main ideologue, organizer and inspirer </li></ul><br>  I think none of them will refuse to help you with advice on the development of the project or its ideas.  For interaction with the Foundation, you can write to the current director, <a href="https://twitter.com/rrubanov">Roman Rubanov</a> .  You can always contact me here: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/alexander.gornik">www.facebook.com/alexander.gornik</a> . <br><br>  <b>PS: Friends, this post is not about politics, but about the interest of public product development with open source.</b>  <b>I would very much like the materials and ideas of this project to be used for the benefit of our society and, I think, a better place than Habr for publication with a similar goal not to be found.</b>  <b>I remind you that the political discussions are absolutely not welcome according to the rules, it‚Äôs better to send all political questions to me on PM.</b> <br><br>  PPS: Tomorrow is Alexey's birthday, so, taking this opportunity, I congratulate him on his coming day, I wish you excuses in all matters and opportunities to do all this and much, much more from what was planned. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/224823/">https://habr.com/ru/post/224823/</a></p>
