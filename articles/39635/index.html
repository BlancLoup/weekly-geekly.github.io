We are committed to ensuring that everything is real, ”says David Rowman, from the HP marketing communications office in California. <br><br>  “We have seen in practice that we should talk less about the properties of our goods and to a greater extent strive to allow people to do something with it themselves,” reports Rouman.  "In this way, we are trying to call the" wow factor "." <br><br>  • <br><br>  Rowman estimates that the “Engine Room” series will cost Hewlett-Packard “tens of millions of dollars”, including qualifying events that lasted during the previous month on <a href="http://mtvengineroom.com/">mtvengineroom.com</a> . <br><br>  In order to take part in the series, about 2,000 people from 122 countries took part in the qualifying round, sending in their works and, according to Romain, about 20,000 works were received. <br><br>  The teams of participants are formed according to the principle of the regions from which they came: Asia and Oceania, Europe, Latin America, North America.  During the competition, popular actors of show and film business will meet with participants. <br><br>  Digital creations of the teams were evaluated by representatives of various fields, including musicians, filmmakers, museum curators, choreographers, tattoo artists, critics, as well as art director of the Hewlett-Packard creative agency Pete Conoli, the author of a series of commercials for HP, during which various pop - stars were shown at the time of using the Internet, captured, like a hidden camera. <br><br>  “We spent 3-4 months on creating a commercial, and then we saw how children spread on YouTube parodies on them, created almost in a few hours,” says account manager from Sanfrancija Hewlett-Packard, Nancy Riyes. <br><br>  “The desire to provide an international platform to these children who create such wonderful things with the help of a computer seems quite natural,” adds Nancy. <br><br>  The decision to broadcast the series via MTV and mtvU was made thanks to the success that was achieved by the youth series “Meet or Delete” in 2006. Episodes of this show remain available on <a href="http://meetordelete.com/">meetordelete.com</a> . <br><br>  Programs that, like “Meet or Delete” and “Engine Room”, are specially created by the order of large companies whose products are promoted during the plot, are becoming more common on TV.  Similar shows, known on Madison Avenue as branded entertainment, have already crossed the line between entertaining the audience and throwing their messages into it. <br><br>  "Our audience does not wait until the TV channel or website gives them what they expect," says Ros Martin from the New York branch of mtvU.  “If they don’t like something, they just click off or delete.” <br><br>  Consequently, “if we act to the detriment of the quality of our programs or their thematic correspondence, we will lose the trust of the public and leave the game.” <br><br>  • <br><br>  According to Martin, advertisers such as Ford Motor, General Electric, Microsoft and Yahoo also order brand entertainment from mtvU. <br><br>  If you google “College 500” - a reality show commissioned by Ford, which was broadcast on mtvU, about a competition between two student teams racing to race across rough terrain - then the search server gives almost 2.8 million results. <br><br>  Viewers in the United States will be able to watch the “Engine Room” series on mtvU, and in other countries on MTV channels and online - in nine languages ​​- on mtvengineroom.com. <br><br>  <i>Translation is made specifically for</i> <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/worldwebstudio"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3b4/e5f/93f/3b4e5f93fec698b310e33c06b7cb2d3e.gif"></a>  <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/worldwebstudio">worldwebstudio</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/39635/">https://habr.com/ru/post/39635/</a></p>
