Before him is the goal - to make a quality service that helps friends meet more often and get discounts in their favorite establishments, and establishments to increase their attendance.  Unfortunately, the base of places is being formed so far only for St. Petersburg and is not available for residents of other cities.  For clarity and location, Yandex Maps are used. <br>  At the launch stage, some feedback and comments from close friends and colleagues are collected, but we want to get a more objective assessment from the wide audience of Habr. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  We would like within one publication to share all the acquired experience at once, but this is difficult to implement.  Therefore, there will be a brief overview of the problems that the project is trying to solve. <br><br>  <b>It's about discounts, places, people and their communication.</b> <br><br><h5>  Let's start with the main thing - our friends </h5><br><ol><li>  The main problem today is that people spend a lot of time on the Internet.  Live meetings with friends are becoming rare.  The world around us becomes like letters and avatars.  Therefore, right now people need meetings and lively emotions. </li><li>  The second important issue is improper communication tools with friends.  The fact that it is not always possible to call all friends: night time, lack of personal time or high emotional costs of communicating with each other interfere with meetings.  The same can be said about messengers and SMS messages.  Therefore, you need a simple tool to quickly notify your friends about your desire to relax. </li><li>  The third important issue is the time-consuming process of gathering friends for joint rest.  Even if you want to relax, you need to collect a company for a long time: to persuade someone, to lure someone, to negotiate and even to impose.  Be sure to have to make great efforts.  In addition, among ordinary people there are few organizers.  Such people would be useful "something" that quickly and at no cost will help organize a meeting. </li></ol>

    <h5>  Places - bars, pubs, restaurants, cafes, tea and other places </h5><br><ol><li>  In institutions existed, exists and there will be a problem with attendance.  This problem is expressed in a dense stream of visitors at weekends, and a weak stream in other days.  It forces institutions to impose coercive savings and enforced restrictions, which inevitably entail a decrease in overall economic efficiency.  Some examples: early closure on weekdays, weekends on Mondays, uneven workloads during the day, overloading or unloading of personnel becomes a problem for establishments and their visitors.  Restaurants should receive the necessary flow of visitors, and visitors should receive comfort in a broad sense. </li><li>  It should be noted that many institutions are poorly computerized and integrated into social networks.  Hence the problem with conveying information to their own clients - the announcement of promotions, special offers.  As a rule, everything is limited to e-mail and SMS-mailing on their own loyalty programs.  Establishments need additional and simple tools for mass communication and integration into social networks. </li></ol><br><br><h5>  Discounts - the main driver of the relationship between places and visitors </h5><br><ol><li>  Institutions already use such tools to stimulate and control the flow of visitors, such as discounts, special offers and promotions.  The problem with them is their current complexity and lack of clarity.  Many conventions and restrictions become a significant obstacle, and therefore complicate the relationship between the establishment and its visitors.  Known examples - the discount is provided only for limited positions, the discount is provided in a specific time interval, a discount on the amount of the check or the volume of the purchase.  We want people to get obvious discount conditions, without tricks.  Begins new discount offer format. </li><li>  Despite the desire to find a new understandable format for visitors, the necessary interest and practicality for institutions should also be taken into account.  For example, it is not profitable for them to provide a single everyday through discount for everything and absolutely to all visitors.  This pushes them to the constant search for an effective, powerful and inexpensive tool. </li></ol><br><br><h5>  Results </h5><br>  That is why an attempt was made to find such a mutually beneficial solution for all.  It turned out to be a hybrid and took shape into an <i>online discount system with mobile discounts</i> - <a href="http://vsosisku.ru/">Vosossisk.ru</a> . <br><br><h6>  For users it became possible: </h6><br><ul><li>  get information about discounts valid <u>until the end of the day</u> </li><li>  quickly notify your friends about wanting to relax today </li><li>  choose a place yourself, create an event there and invite friends </li><li>  share photos from past meetings and vote for your favorite </li></ul><br><br><h6>  For institutions it became possible: </h6><br><ul><li>  communication with the target audience </li><li>  manage the flow of visitors through the size of the discount </li><li>  organize interesting events and share them </li></ul><br><br>  We remind you that the project is pilot.  Now reviews are collected, a base of places is formed - participants of the discount system, the first discounts are connected and the first discount cards are distributed. <br><br>  <b>We are grateful to everyone who showed interest.</b>  <b>Please, if possible, leave your vote in the survey and / or comments - this is important for us.</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/169021/">https://habr.com/ru/post/169021/</a></p>
