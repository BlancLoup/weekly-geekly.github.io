  <section class="page js-page"><h1>During the day it was sold 3.3 million copies of the game World of Warcraft: Cataclysm</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/b59071bb/038e345f/a4ced652/ab747e20.jpg"><br><br>  Today it became known that in just a day about 3.3 million copies of the WoW release - World of Warcraft: Cataclysm were sold.  According to the company Activision Blizzard, the number of sales includes not only boxed versions of the game, but also those copies that were purchased by gamers in online stores.  In general, a very good result, which is called a record in Blizzard.  The company has already called its brainchild the best-selling PC game.  It is worth noting that the previous record, beaten by the current achievement, also belonged to WOW.  In 2008, it sold 2.8 million copies of the Wrath of the Lich King. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  In general, this excitement is understandable - millions of players were waiting for a new release, in which, as promised by the developers, a lot of things were finalized and revised.  Those who have already managed to familiarize themselves with the changed world confirm the scale of the changes.  The sale of the new release was launched immediately in such regions as the USA, Canada, Mexico, Argentina, Chile, Europe, Russia, the countries of Southeast Asia, Australia and New Zealand.  Such a large-scale start, naturally, had a very strong influence on the number of copies of the game sold on the first day.  About 10 thousand stores around the world have increased the duration of the working day on the day of release, so that more eager could buy the desired release.

      The company reported that more than 15,000 players participated in various sales opening ceremonies that also took place around the world, including the United States, Canada, France, Germany, Russia, Sweden, the Netherlands, Spain, the United Kingdom and Taiwan. <br><br>  In connection with the record sales of the game, and the growing number of subscribers in a large number of regions, Blizzard announced the recruitment of new employees, most of whom will be engaged in the development and support of localizations of Wrath of the Lich King in their regions.  What to do - everyone (well, or almost every) gamer wants to see the game in its own language.  Of course, high-quality localization is rare, but anything is possible. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/109960/">https://habr.com/ru/post/109960/</a></p>
