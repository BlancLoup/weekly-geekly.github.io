  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Bobby Special Purpose Backpack</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the world there are quite a lot of companies producing such a class of things like backpacks.  Even more there are backpacks themselves: for laptops, for cameras, for cameras and laptops, for drones, for outdoor activities, for lying with vegetables, etc. - only we have selected more than 50 models on our site (and this is <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/ryukzaki/filter/availability-is-1/apply/%3Fsort%3Dpopular">available</a> ).  It would seem, to talk about them on Geektimes there is no point, backpacks and backpacks.  But today we‚Äôll tell you about one, because he deserves the attention of geeks for sure: this is the new Bobby from the Dutch company XD-Design. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/489/43e/6ac/48943e6ac7a1b5db3a67ba569f60baa7.jpg"></div><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The company XD-Design may be known to you not so much by backpacks as by various accessories.  Even more than that, she does not specialize in backpacks at all, but as history shows, even ‚Äúbeginners‚Äù can sometimes be surprised. <br><br>  Bobby Backpack is the result of a successful crowdfunding campaign that was launched in April 2016 on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/257670560/bobby-the-best-anti-theft-backpack-by-xd-design">Kickstarter</a> and <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/bobby-the-best-anti-theft-backpack-by-xd-design">Indiegogo</a> .  More than 10,000 people took part in the fundraising, who in total greatly exceeded the plan (raised ¬£ 872,607, that is, almost 67 million rubles) - in this situation it remained only to wait for the creators to move from theory to practice.  By the way, the process of creation did not begin to drag out and in the fall the backers began to receive the first copies.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/220/956/8ce/2209568ce4bf42faa3a38b36caa99f2f.png"><br><br>  The manufacturer calls its product nothing less than ‚ÄúThe best Anti-Theft Backpack‚Äù, which can be translated as ‚Äúthe best anti-theft backpack‚Äù.  However, like any other item in this world, this backpack can be easily stolen, so instead of ‚Äúanti-theft‚Äù, the term ‚Äúanti-theft backpack‚Äù is more suitable for pickpockets.  According to the website, more than 400,000 pickpockets occur daily in the world - of course, not all of them are associated with backpacks, but there is a certain percentage with them :) And Bobby was originally designed to reduce the chances of becoming part of this statistic. <br><br><blockquote>  The word Bobby has quite a few <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Bobby">interpretations</a> , but in this case it is the name of the police, which has been used in London since 1829.  Then Interior Minister Robert Peel (actually, Bobby is a diminutive form of Robert) founded the Metropolitan Police Service, while before his reform private police (‚Äúthieves hunters‚Äù) were distributed, one of whose tasks was to make business profits.  In this, Peel saw the reason for the corruption of the former institute for the protection of public order.  Peel's reforms created a prototype of the modern police, whose activities were based on crime prevention and regular patrols. </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f8d/151/613/f8d15161370bacfda54b73c6a5fe1cba.jpg"><br><br>  How do they usually steal items from a backpack?  Yes, it is primitive - somewhere in the subway they open a zipper, pull out a laptop and run away.  And sometimes the lightning itself does diverge.  In Bobby, if the lightning does not want to be opened without her consent, it will not open :) <br><br>  The Bobby backpack is designed so that the zipper of the main compartment (there is one here) is hidden by a thick fabric bend on the back of the backpack adjacent to the back.  That is, while the backpack is on your back, it is simply impossible to unbutton the compartment ‚Äúfrom the outside‚Äù - the zipper is not even visible. <br><br>  Bob doesn‚Äôt have any compartments sticking outward - everything is hidden inside, which will upset any pickpocket. <br><br>  ‚ÄúNothing will upset him - he will just open the backpack with the blade and steal the macbook in the same way - you will say and you will be wrong.  The fact is that Bobby uses a multi-layer cake made from various materials, among which there is a cutproof layer made of solid polypropylene - it forms a kind of frame, protecting everything inside.  This is direct +5 to armor.  The upper layer is a stylish polyester fabric, followed by a 6 mm layer of anti-shock material (anti-shock), followed by several layers of fabric providing additional protection.  So if someone starts to cut the backpack, then do it imperceptibly will not work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bb6/f5a/5fe/bb6f5a5feed94ccb88a2ff213675b4c9.png"><br><br>  In addition to the vandal-resistant design, the backpack has water-repellent properties - nothing will happen to the contents in the rain.  But it‚Äôs still not a moisture barrier - swimming in the pool with Bobby is not recommended. <br><br>  The backpack is completely unmarked - any dirt is removed from it with wet wipes.  Also outside there are such useful elements as light reflectors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2ab/a4f/70b/2aba4f70bdd2289140dee58e57f43b0c.jpg"><br><br>  <i>Special thanks to the creators that a giant logo was not placed on such a large surface, as many other brands like to do.</i> <br><br>  The main locking mechanism is the original YKK-zipper (good fittings - a pledge of long service) with two "dogs", which allows you to open a branch on the side from which you prefer.  From pleasant trifles - in the shifted state, in ‚Äúdogs‚Äù a common hole is formed, into which a small padlock can be inserted.  Of course, this will not save from experienced attackers, but as an option "protection from a fool" - completely. <br><br><blockquote>  Right now look at the "dog" of lightning on your clothes - it is likely that there is an inscription on it YKK.  This is the name of the largest manufacturer of zippers, stickies and other rivets / fasteners / fasteners.  The abbreviation stands for ‚ÄúYoshida K≈çgy≈ç Kaisha‚Äù and translated from Japanese means ‚ÄúYoshida Factory‚Äù - in honor of the company's founder, who opened the production of fasteners for clothes in the 1930s.  Now all over the world there are more than 70 factories of the company, they produce more than half of all fasteners on the planet and more than <a href="http://www.gearshout.net/ykk-mirovoy-lider-v-proizvodstve-zastezhek-molniy/">50 series of</a> zippers alone. <br><br>  ¬ª <a href="http://masterok.livejournal.com/2295980.html">An interesting post about YKK</a> </blockquote><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8ce/ad9/ed5/8cead9ed5d211b49f6e86fbdddb7b53b.png"></div><br><h2>  Inside </h2><br>  Inside, Bobby is no less interesting.  The backpack has three opening angles: <br><br>  30·µí - a slightly open state, which will be used most often (in transport or when a backpack hangs on the back of a chair) - just open the zipper and get access to the internal compartment; <br><br>  90·µí - if you completely unzip the zipper - in this position it is convenient to pull out everything you need at home or at work, putting the backpack on the table; <br><br>  180·µí - with this angle of disclosure, it is most convenient to collect things for a long trip in order to use the inner space as efficiently as possible.  To open a backpack at such an angle, you need to unfasten the fabric stops, which form an angle of 90·µí due to velcro and rivet buttons. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/879/7f1/3a0/8797f13a050f40b1a972960a21760444.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/193/00f/1af/19300f1af39bb9268fc541c15e71e97a.jpg"><br><br>  At the disposal of the owner, in fact, only one compartment, and at the bottom of this compartment there are two separate pockets in which mirrorless mirrors, external disks, thermoses, umbrellas and other cups can easily be accommodated. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b7e/c03/cda/b7ec03cda061c70d94debde1f8e5c5b4.jpg"><br><br>  But a full-fledged DSLR, lenses or a sliding tripod will not fit in there - such wealth will have to be placed above the pockets.  The exact dimensions of all branches will be at the end of the post. <br><br>  The main compartment has two adjacent compartments, which are located on the back - they have a strictly defined functional purpose: a large one is designed for a laptop, the second one (smaller) is for a tablet and / or electric books. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a2c/a4b/500/a2ca4b50025afe914b90dda6ac07e300.jpg"><br>  <i>A laptop with a diagonal of up to 15.6 "fits into a large compartment, and a smaller version fits into the smaller compartment, as well as its larger version, but the iPad Pro no longer.</i> <br><br>  In both of these compartments there are diagonal rubber mounts for additional fixation, which allow you to protect delicate devices from external stimuli.  Surely many of you have a backpack with a laptop at least once flew off the seat of the car during heavy braking?  In such a situation, these rubber bands will ‚Äúspring‚Äù the devices and will not allow them to either fly out of the compartment or hit something. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/534/310/72d/53431072d7c7c27b74103d37fd226dfa.jpg"><br><br>  For a more dense layout, two combined pockets hang at the very top of the folding part of the backpack: one outside and with a zipper (for all sorts of trivia such as memory cards, card readers), the second one without (for keys, gum, tablets, etc.).  Outside - 4 elastic bands for horizontal fastening of handles and pencils made of IKEA :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d98/cc0/05c/d98cc005c4442543c2d821c2171bb25e.jpg"><br><br>  The next chip is unlikely to leave anyone indifferent.  In the right strap is a USB port (output - 2.4A), which somewhere in the thickness of the backpack turns into an elegant wire - it can be plugged into the powerbank, for which there is also a separate compartment (rather large), hidden behind inconspicuous lightning.  As a result, you will always have a ‚Äúsocket‚Äù at your fingertips, which, what to hide, in our time is needed by each of us. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/70a/87d/653/70a87d6534a99bd18f8d72de900e0387.jpg"><br><br>  The connector is pointing down so that water does not get into it, and it is located at the bottom of the webbing - so that the gadget that is charged as you go is comfortable to put in your pocket.  Believe me - it is much more convenient than when a power bank of 10,000 mAh is squeezed into your pocket and pulls your pants off, or when you are wounded like a shahid. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/db4/a36/5b5/db4a365b5874a954e3368240632e9186.jpg"><br><br>  Near the connector (and also on the other side) there are small compartments with zippers - it‚Äôs not quite clear what they are for, but as they say, there would be a place.  The most convenient way to store things like a zipper closure, wires for a power bank or a set of adapters for them. <br><br>  In many backpacks there is a "bug" in the form of protruding ribbons, with the help of which the tension of the shoulder straps is regulated - as a rule, they chaotically dangle, all such battered and tacky. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a76/37f/ea9/a7637fea9f65cda0fb8688e43a56fac4.jpg"><br><br>  In Bobby for them in each strap there are special slit-like pockets where these ribbons can be hidden imperceptibly. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/761/04e/204/76104e2045ae3e93064da3e912c2b321.jpg"><br><br>  This decision was born by chance, but in general these pockets are designed to store in them a travel card, a card or a couple of cash ruble. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/95a/bfd/62d/95abfd62d436cff577128e8d89c28af8.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ca6/b82/cf9/ca6b82cf9a10c0ed91ec9cb64072b373.jpg"><br><br>  The list of buns in all of the above does not end there. <br><br>  On the back of the backpack there is a ‚Äúfast‚Äù compartment with a zipper in which something flat can fit, for example, a PTS, passport, plane tickets or something similar.  This compartment is not felt back and for intruders, it is also inaccessible. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/beb/a46/b44/beba46b44c61789bf26ecf87beb99035.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/169/589/b4d/169589b4d34757782dc7953b4b29aaad.jpg"><br><br>  You looked at one more chip now, but most likely you did not notice.  The bonus for the traveler is the back strap over the ‚Äúquick compartment‚Äù, thanks to which the backpack can be attached to the pull-out handle of the suitcase. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/790/997/4d6/7909974d6d433f2264cd66810b97429d.png"></div><br>  Surely you have such that you roll a suitcase at the airport, on which is a bag on top, which in every turn tries to either fall off or ‚Äúrock the boat‚Äù?  ) In the case of Bobby, this is excluded - the backpack becomes one with the suitcase and excludes its tilting, as well as the sudden abduction. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ec5/7e2/fdd/ec57e2fddcd5e30552004ce31e98df19.gif"></div><br>  If you try to fit all the stuff, it will certainly fit, but still the feeling that the backpack is cramped inside does not leave.  And even more so this is not a solution for photographers with a fleet of optics.  On the other hand, it was initially understood that this is not a shuttle trunk, but a compact backpack for everyday use. <br><br><h2>  Sensations </h2><br>  It is not enough just to have a thoughtful backpack - it is necessary that it is comfortable in everyday use.  And in this regard, Bobby also has arguments. <br><br>  The backpack is very light - only 850 grams.  If you wear it on one shoulder, then the side pockets will interfere slightly, which will force you to put a backpack on both shoulders - this is even more correct for the back and does not contradict the main idea (so that all the compartments are hidden).  In this case, these side pockets literally "hug." <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fde/3f4/372/fde3f437226c384c889ced382f01f053.jpg"><br><br>  In the back there are foam inserts (or something similar), which are hidden behind the perforated fabric - a convenient, practical and ventilated solution. <br><br>  The manufacturer does not report anything about the orthopedic properties of the backpack, however, there is no discomfort from prolonged wear.  Moreover, the manufacturer claims a well-thought-out layout of the internal compartments, which, regardless of their size, forms a sly weight distribution, as a result of which the backpack feels easier by 20% and is always pressed to the back. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/52a/f9c/2c4/52af9c2c47f04f6fb98a0de63f1818ea.png"><br>  For fans to wear a backpack in hand - reliable handle: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/075/53a/aae/07553aaae5c71441e535bfaf800290f5.jpg"><br><br>  Y is convenient. <br><br>  As for the quality of workmanship, fabric and seams - here without complaints.  Is that the clips on the straps are not very securely held (sometimes you have to tighten them), but they can always be changed. <br><br><h2>  Specifications </h2><br><blockquote>  Dimensions of the backpack: 45 x 30 x 16.5 cm <br>  Holds up to 15.6 "laptop <br>  Laptop compartment: 27 x 33 x 3.5 cm <br>  Tablet Compartment: 25.5 x 12 x 1 cm <br>  Pocket for a bottle of water (not only for a bottle): 9 x 14 x 5 cm <br>  Neighboring pocket for bottle: 13 x 14 x 5 cm <br>  Upper pocket with elastic bands for pens or keys: 20 x 10 x 3 cm <br>  Hidden pocket on the back: 28 x 13 x 2 cm <br>  Hidden side pockets: 12.5 x 15 x 2 cm <br>  Backpack weight: 850 gr <br>  Weight: 850g <br>  USB output: 2.4A </blockquote><br>  As they say, it's better to see once: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MiTD6Hs6HBk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><h2>  To order </h2><br>  Bobby is equally suitable for human individuals of any gender and age.  A choice of 4 colors: black, gray, red and dark blue, and the color changes not only outside but also inside.  A survey of the company showed that gray (37% of respondents chose it) and black (32%) are the most popular, while blue and red have 15% each. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/33c/d4a/e68/33cd4ae68ae85fd749c2465e60225f37.jpg"></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f5c/0da/201/f5c0da20164709c32ea5ff47e58dd6a1.jpg"></div><br>  Those who took part in the crowdfunding campaign, depending on the contribution, received with the backpack various bonuses, such as a lock (for the dogs of the main compartment), a waterproof case, RFID card holders (to protect the card from wireless skimming), Neva bottle (metal water bottle), Oova-headphones or even a custom logo on the backpack. <br><br> <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/xddesign-bobby/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f8b/767/4eb/f8b7674eb45b46d5a5527cbc2f4cd2a3.png"></a> <br><br>  At the moment, the XD-Design Bobby backpack is not supplied to Russia, but you can buy it in <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/xddesign-bobby/">our store</a> .  As always, there is a <b>5% discount for Geektimes readers</b> on the GEEK promo code.  And we advise to hurry - a very small party has come to Russia and the next one will arrive no earlier than December. <br><br><h2>  The end </h2><br>  The desire to somehow protect ourselves and our property is inherent in nature in each of us and manifests itself in many places: we put clever locks on thick doors, hang video cameras, tint / book cars, invent complicated passwords, use fingerprints to access the phone, etc. d.  In other words, after Bobby, you hardly want any other backpack that does not have similar properties.  And here it was pleasantly pleased not only with a large number of places thought out to the smallest detail (which make up the daily convenience and safety of using a backpack, and this is precisely its main task), but also the quality of the production of the backpack as a whole - there is nothing to complain about. <br><br>  No deficiencies in the backpack was found.  Well, except for the headphones, you could still add a connector, but in the era of the rejection of minijacks this is hardly a minus.  As for the internal space - yes, it is not very large, but most of what you carry with you every day will fit in there: a laptop, tablet, chargers, pavers, documents, wipes, pens, flash drives, headphones, etc.  At the same time outside the backpack will not look like a paratrooper's trunk.  And yes, it will all be safe. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/398999/">https://habr.com/ru/post/398999/</a></p>
