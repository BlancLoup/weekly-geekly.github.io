      When designing an IP video surveillance system, the following tasks often arise: <br><br>  - Select a switch with the optimal number of ports for connecting a small number of IP cameras.  On the market, low-port switches are represented by models for 4 and 8 ports and, as a rule, with a low total power. <br>  - IP cameras need to be connected a distance greater than the range of the Ethernet segment to the nearest PoE switch.  To do this, put the intermediate equipment in the form of additional switches or PoE extenders.  Outside the premises, such a switchboard should have a hermetic design or be placed in a special cabinet. <br>  - PoE switches are placed over a large area, exceeding the range of the Ethernet segment to the nearest central switch.  To do this, you need to choose a switch that supports optical communication channel.  In the market there are inexpensive switches with SFP, but without the support of the gigabit channel, and the support of two gigabit Combo ports is inherent in the already expensive models. <br>  - Necessity to organize additional or reserve illumination.  For this purpose, IP cameras with built-in backlight, with low power LEDs, are used, or additional spotlights are installed, for which a separate cable is usually laid. <br><br>  The developed equipment should help solve all these problems both in the organization of video surveillance on the street and inside the premises. <br><br>  The set of equipment consists of a switch, an IP camera and a searchlight. <br><br>  Tasks assigned during the development: <br>  - Cover as far as possible when placing IP cameras using standard Ethernet technology <br>  - Connect as many IP cameras as possible to one switch <br>  - Provide high quality shooting at night <br>  - Simplify equipment installation by reducing the number of wires <br>  - Do not use additional wiring to power IP cameras and spotlights. <br>  - The switch must have the flexibility of settings, have a high power source and the ability to connect to the network through copper and optics <br>  By the time we started developing the switch and the spotlight, we already had in our assortment IP-cameras of standard and hermetic design with an integrated switch for 2 Ethernet ports, through which you can connect several IP cameras in series.  The Ethernet ports of the IP camera support pass-through PoE power, which we called Pass-Through PoE. <br><br><table><tbody><tr><td><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6a5/080/f9e/6a5080f9ed080bcfe5cc93a1fa216768.jpg" width="400"></td><td><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/795/55b/4cc/79555b4ccd9c89c1f6bd4adc28eb49b2.jpg" width="400"></td></tr></tbody></table><br><br>  For the implementation of transit power sources are used PoE, which work according to the type of "B" (for free pairs).  In the standard connection mode, the IP camera can work from any PoE source.  Power consumption IP-camera is 4.5 watts. <br>  To implement chains of IP cameras using the maximum length of the Ethernet segment, the development of high-power PoE sources was required.  As a PoE switch, an SG-17S rack platform was used, in which the MS-17E8PP Ethernet modules are installed.  These modules have 8 Ethernet ports that support PoE power up to 60 W per port, the type of power supply is free pair.  The capacity of the switch, depending on the number of modules installed, is 8/16/24/32 ports, and the power at the ports can be adjusted programmatically.  The chassis as standard has a power supply with an output of 240 W or can be connected to an external source with an output of up to 1 kW. <br>  Practical studies of operating modes with a serial connection showed that when using a standard Cat-5 cable, you can connect up to five IP cameras with one hundred meter segments.  Simultaneous powering of the entire chain on short cables is possible with 10 IP cameras. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5cc/f40/dd8/5ccf40dd809003405abfa4b586570d58.jpg"><br><br>  For outdoor placement of IP cameras, special thermal enclosures with PoE power supply and an integrated floodlight appeared in the range - up to 10 watts.  Housings have two pressure seals for the possibility of serial connection.  Taking into account that the power consumption of a thermowell with a searchlight can be 15 W, the maximum number of devices in the chain is no more than 4, in practice this number taking into account the lengths of the wires is 2-3 pieces. <br>  With the advent of the IP camera in the outdoor sealed version of the SG-3C series, there was no need to use an additional thermal housing.  IP cameras support temperature range from -40 to +50 ¬∞ C. <br>  For example, SG-3C-1612: Network interface 2xEthernet 10/100 PoE, matrix: 1 / 2.8 "CMOS Sony IMX136 2 Mpix 120dB, H.264, MPEG4, MJPEG 1920x1080 30 fps, lens: 3 Mpixel, 2.8-12mm, motor zoom, auto focus, performance: street tight. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ca7/8f6/f90/ca78f6f902dc08daf77009ed5ca2cc77.jpg"><br><br>  The need for additional lighting remained relevant.  In the development of housings with a spotlight, we are faced with the need to ensure a good heat dissipation from the LEDs.  To ensure the recommended LED temperature, it required the development of a special heat dissipating structure, the installation of additional fans and temperature control by a microprocessor with software protection in the form of power reduction at critical temperatures. <br>  The use of low-power backlight (3 ... 5 W), which is used in most IP cameras with built-in backlight, was considered inexpedient.  Raising the power of the backlight without a special heat dissipation is the risk of overheating of the IP camera.  Therefore, it was decided to carry out the searchlight in a separate building.  At the same time, the searchlight must be able to receive power via PoE via the same communication line supplied for the IP camera. <br>  The advantages of using a spotlight separately from an IP camera are quite obvious. <br>  - It allows you to organize a good heat sink and due to this use high power spotlights <br>  - Natural interference in the form of insects, rain and snow falling into the light of the searchlight does not worsen the shooting conditions, since this does not happen in front of the IP camera <br>  - Connecting multiple spotlights to a single camera allows you to highlight the scene being shot from several points at once and increase the overall backlight power <br>  - Spotlights with visible illumination allow you to provide an object with additional light in dark places and to record video in color mode <br><br>  That's what happened in the end. <br>  SG-1L-W1 is an LED floodlight with PoE power, power control and light sensor.  The model is made in the version with white backlight based on the diode assembly.  In the future, it is possible to produce a searchlight with IR LEDs.  But the visible illumination compared to the infrared in combination with the Sigrand IP cameras has one significant advantage - if the camera turns off the IR filter during infrared illumination and goes into black and white, the image mode remains in color when using a white illuminator.  The transition to black and white mode is a separate setting. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/da4/7c4/927/da47c4927d1745a9eedca20c10702971.jpg"><br><br>  New projectors are very easy to install because they do not require additional power wiring.  To connect them, you can use the existing data cable with PoE power supplied to the IP cameras. <br>  Each projector is equipped with two Ethernet ports, through which both power and information signal are passed through.  This allows you to connect spotlights in series with one PoE source.  Such a chain can complete any IP-camera with PoE power. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/aeb/4da/4b7/aeb4da4b7c92298174dbab1323b0a4a5.jpg"><br><br>  When using Sigrand IP cameras, the connection sequence can be any.  You can connect multiple spotlights to the same camera or alternate IP cameras and spotlights. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2cf/2b0/eb4/2cf2b0eb4c9897dc73b584912548ca7b.jpg"><br><br>  Depending on the number of connected spotlights and the type of PoE power source, the power of the spotlight can be adjusted in the range from 5 to 20 watts.  For automatic ‚Äúon-off‚Äù the searchlight has a built-in light sensor.  This provides additional energy savings and resource saving diodes. <br><br>  The main characteristics of the floodlight SG-1L-W1. <br>  Spotlight <br>  - Light source type: LED assembly <br>  - Maximum power of LED backlight, W: 20 <br>  - Color temperature, K: 5000-5500 <br>  - Angle of radiation (review), degrees: 120 <br>  - Maximum luminous flux, Lm: 2000-2200 <br>  - Backlight on / off threshold, Luke: 20-30 <br>  - Adjustable power values, W: 5, 10, 15, 20 (manual setting) <br>  Execution <br>  - IP66, aluminum <br>  - Dimensions, mm: 180x80 (without fastening) <br>  - Mass in collection, g: 950 <br>  - Fastening: articulated, three degrees of freedom, wire connections <br>  Interfaces <br>  - 2 Ethernet ports 10/100 with PoE, pass-through <br>  Nutrition <br>  - PoE 48 volts (type B) with the possibility of connecting several devices in series <br><br>  Planned retail price in the series: $ 100. <br><br>  The missing link for the installation of an outdoor video surveillance system remained a small-capacity switch.  The existing SG-17S switch copes with the task of providing high-power power, but for connecting a small number of IP cameras it is often a redundant solution, with at least 8 ports.  In addition, the switch SG-17S has a number of advanced features inherent in devices of high price group.  The switch supports web, command line, or ssh management.  VLAN, routing, NAT, forwarding are supported.  In addition, the SG-17S chassis allows the installation of not only Ethernet modules, but can also act as a DSLAM with SHDSL support up to 15.2 Mbit / s over a single pair. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b48/982/b5e/b48982b5e2a3fc2478d7b60b957b5e04.jpg"><br><br>  It took a simpler device with the minimum required set of control functions, but with high power on the PoE ports. <br>  This device was a desktop managed 6-port switch with SFP support - SG-1S. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/47f/c0a/444/47fc0a444329c8c76642178385dd0690.jpg"><br><br>  The SG-1S switchboard is made in the desktop version in an aluminum housing.  The front panel has 6 Ethernet 10/100 ports with PoE power and two 10/100 / 1000BASE-T / SFP combo ports.  Power is supplied by free pairs in Passive PoE mode.  Detection of the presence of PoE load is provided, therefore it is allowed to connect any Ethernet devices. <br>  A fan and a miniUSB console port are displayed on the back panel. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/046/8ae/17d/0468ae17da79858f3cb712a99af2efe6.jpg"><br><br>  The built-in power supply has an output power of 250 W, which allows to obtain high power on all PoE ports.  Power distribution to the ports can be performed through the terminal connected to the miniUSB interface.  In the 4-port mode, you can configure the switch operation up to 60 W per port, in the 6-port mode and up to 40 W.  This allows you to connect devices with increased consumption (PTZ cameras) or organize serial connections from multiple devices in Pass-Through PoE mode.  Monitoring the status of the ports allows you to know the consumption of connected devices and the remaining power that can be used for free ports. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/57c/464/dfc/57c464dfc0239d27dde9ee5798eb5719.jpg"><br><br>  The main characteristics of SG-1S. <br>  Interfaces: <br>  - 2 10/100 / 1000BASE-T / SFP combo ports <br>  - 6 ports 10 / 100BASE-T, Passive PoE + (up to 60 W in the mode of 4 ports or up to 40 W in the mode of 6 ports) <br>  - 1 miniUSB port (console) <br>  Execution: <br>  - Desktop <br>  - Dimensions: width 200 mm;  height 60 mm;  depth 112 mm <br>  - Weight: 1.3 kg <br>  Nutrition: <br>  - 110-240V AC, frequency 50-60 Hz <br><br>  Planned retail price in the series: $ 270. <br><br>  Result. <br>  As a result, we received a set of equipment that will minimize the costs when installing a video surveillance system.  An additional option in the form of a spotlight will help to get a color, high-quality picture at any time of the day due to good illumination. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/aa6/0b0/f2a/aa60b0f2a426c7aca1692cd13dbbd6b0.jpg"><br><br>  For example, the SG-1S switchboard was involved in the Safe Area project in a school in Novosibirsk.  To connect 23 IP cameras, only one SG-1S switch was required (4 ports were involved).  The number of IP cameras connected to different Ethernet ports was: 5, 5, 6, 7 pieces. <br><br>  Read more about the project and see the floor diagrams of connecting IP cameras <a href="http://sigrand.ru/ru_RU/c/document_library/get_file%3Fuuid%3D876e56d4-45fa-4080-a873-302a97a214ac%26groupId%3D10226">here</a> . <br><br>  Online streaming from the camera SG-3C-1612 with illuminated spotlight SG-1L-W1 can be viewed <a href="http://www.sigrand.com/index.php%3Foption%3Dcom_banners%26task%3Dclick%26id%3D3%26lang%3Dru">here</a> .  The focal length of the lens is 2.8 mm; for the SONY IMX136 1 / 2.8 mm sensor, the horizontal angle is around 100 degrees. <br><br>  Immediate plans. <br>  The IP camera of the SG-2C series is preparing for release.  This is a PTZ indoor PTZ IP camera, which, like previous models, will have two Ethernet PoE ports, a built-in microphone and a speaker, and optics from a choice of 2.8-12 or 6-22 with autofocus mode. <br>  The universal switch SG-18S is being prepared for release.  The switch will have switch and router capabilities, as well as support NVR function.  The switch is made in 19 ‚Äùversion, supports the installation of Ethernet modules on 8/16/24 port, has a built-in power source up to 1.5 kW and allows you to install HDD 3.5‚Äù. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/224227/">https://habr.com/ru/post/224227/</a></p>
