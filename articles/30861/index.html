We, a nation preoccupied with privacy issues, easily disclose our most intimate secrets to the whole world. <br><br>  And what if I tell you that I know all the sites that you visit, I read all the letters you have ever written or received, every message in the messenger that you have ever sent, and the content of each call that you made ?  I know how much you pay for an apartment, how much money is in your account.  I even know that you collect sculptures of dwarfs.  You will surely be beside yourself with anger. <br><br>  But what if I say that a system already exists that collects all this information, has been doing this for years, and is not connected with any government?  Yes, it exists, it is called Google - a huge information "black box".

      Google is a search giant that will not stop until it collects and digitizes every piece of information that has ever been created - from the Constitution to the student‚Äôs diary entry.  They believe that this is their mission, and people continue to feed the monster devouring data.  For what?  For the sake of several gigabytes for mail and file storage?  Is this the price you are willing to pay to uncover all secrets to the world? <br><br>  Everyone remembers Google‚Äôs deal to buy AOL shares?  The key to it is AOL Instant Messenger, a communication system with a multi-million dollar audience.  Remember my words: in less than 2 years, Google will fully integrate with AOL, and then begin to collect all of our messages (both useful and useless). <br><br>  And what protects you from such gloomy prospects?  User data protection policy - privacy policy.  A document written by Google lawyers that will protect the company if something goes wrong.  All your boundless faith in a multi-billion-dollar company, whose main goal is to collect all the information on earth, is based on that privacy policy page.  Similarly, you believe in Google.  But not me. <br><br>  Has anyone researched google management procedures?  How long are search logs stored?  Where do emails get to GMail after you ‚Äúdelete‚Äù them?  Are backups well protected?  Is encryption secure?  Did hackers access any information stored by Google?  Are they sharing information with the government behind their users? <br><br>  People willingly share with Google the information that the NSA (the US National Security Agency) only dreams about - to know EVERYTHING about you.  You do not even need to be a registered user to be ‚Äúindexed‚Äù.  When Google starts working as a provider, they will definitely become the basis of the Internet.  When this happens, your network traffic will somehow get to them - and Google will be able to fully structure and save ALL of the information. <br><br>  And at this moment the government will join the work.  To find out something interesting about you and your life, all that the Department of Justice will need is a secret inquiry from your own court (we all already know that they have such) who will surely be satisfied.  User No. 8.889.863.279 from now on - under the microscope, no secrets. <br><br>  Why choose Google?  Because they announced a long-term campaign to collect all the information.  Although check "for lice" need all.  Make them adhere to stricter standards than ‚Äúprivacy policy‚Äù - and ask more questions before giving them information. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/30861/">https://habr.com/ru/post/30861/</a></p>
