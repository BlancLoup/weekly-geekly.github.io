Hackathon members create business applications using the Mastercard API. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ab0/4b6/202/ab04b6202d3721cb8f3862e0f3169330.png" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The hackathons organized by one or another brand are no longer a news: now almost every large company seeks to meet the developers / startups and invite them to their own marathon.  But in the cases of ‚ÄúMasters of the code‚Äù impressive scope: the company has planned 14 events in 11 countries during the year.  To date, successfully conducted <a href="http://www.hackathon.io/master-card">13 of them</a> in Australia, Brazil, Singapore, Israel and other countries.  London was their last but one stop before the big finals in San Francisco.  They bypassed Russia - nevertheless, <a href="http://edsd.ru/">Edison is</a> interested in following their news, because in one of the projects the company had to deal with API MasterCard, which left the best impressions. <br><br>  The participants had one day to create a program using the MasterCard API and another secret API, which was discovered just before the start of the competition: it turned out to be the travel planner from the London transport department TfL <a href="https://tfl.gov.uk/">tfl.gov.uk</a>

      The competition itself included 24 hours of development followed by two-minute presentations of the results of the teams before the jury, which resulted in the selection of six finalists.  After that, the second presentation took place, and the winning team received the title of London "Masters of the code." <br><br>  They were the team of employees of London-based IT consultant Keytree, who developed the All-together iOS application (All of Us), which takes on the hassle of organizing a joint evening with friends: from the road to paying the bill in a restaurant and seeing off to the house. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cd8/125/b85/cd8125b8587786cfcd3c959696e0f449.png" alt="image"><br>  <i>In the photo, however, just not all of them - the two remaining members of the team were forced to leave immediately after the completion of the marathon</i> <br><br><blockquote>  As residents of London, we well know how to get around the city where we need, so we rarely need to plan our movements, but we do not know how busy the roads are in certain directions.  We have created an application that allows you to measure the status of traffic in the system so that our users can make the most convenient route from point A to point B <br>  - <i><a href="https://developer.mastercard.com/portal/display/blogs/2015/11/19/Meet%2Bthe%2BLondon%2BMasters%2Bof%2BCode">winners of the London hackathon</a></i> </blockquote><br>  The team used the Mastercard API to plan a club night, as well as to divide the score between the revel members. <br>  The application is tied to the functionality of Facebook events: first you create an event there, and then via Facebook you log in to All of Us and see the countdown to the next booze: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5ff/fae/40d/5fffae40dfc4a70f5ecac9f794527333.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Then you will only have to fill in the details of the event, including the venue.  And when the time comes for the meeting, the application will remind you about it and suggest the best route: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b7c/455/3fd/b7c4553fdb02dbf062b03b8f7bc848f4.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The most interesting begins on the spot: the application allows you to keep track of what has been eaten and drunk, and a special portal has been created for the establishment itself, through which they can receive payment from the entire company in a couple of clicks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b81/843/e5b/b81843e5bcf1cd61c059c19c387096aa.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/990/e8d/95f/990e8d95f61bb76c470c938546e21c62.png" alt="image"><br><br>  When the evening is over, guests can determine how much each one will pay: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/889/4c6/e43/8894c6e43d61f46fad667f36d56520c9.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Thus, splitting up a noisy company account becomes easier than ever.  No cash, cash back or confusion with bills (who among those who read this article, participated <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/search/%3Fq%3D%255B%25D1%2585%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B1%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D1%2587%25D0%25B0%255D%26target_type%3Dposts">in habrowstorms</a> , may recall that the establishments will never bring a separate bill to a company from more than 10 people).  Now - no confusion. <br><br>  But at the end of the application will inform all participants of the party, when their friends safely get home. <br><br>  In 24 hours, the All of Us team created an iOS application, a portal for restaurateurs, a web-map of the position of friends in the London transport system, a completely ready backend with integrated APIs of Google Places, Facebook, TfL, MasterCard Simplify commerce and MasterCard Sending Money. <br>  You can read more about how this works with all screenshots on the website of the proud employers of the All of Us team: <a href="http://www.keytree.co.uk/masters-of-code-london-winners/">www.keytree.co.uk/masters-of-code-london-winners</a> <br><br>  Presenting their work, the team beat the famous MasterCard slogan: <br><br><blockquote>  A glass of martini before going out?  30 pounds.  Sushi in a newfangled restaurant?  50 pounds.  Do not argue about who owes how much to pay the bill - priceless! </blockquote><br>  On all the hackathons of the ‚ÄúMasters of the Code‚Äù series, Mario Chiliaschi, Senior Vice President of the API Mastercard Open API, as well as the main developer and evangelist Sebastian Tavo, travel. <br><br>  <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/07/13/masters-of-code/">According to Shilyashka</a> , this is the first large independent series of hackathons arranged by Mastercard.  Tavo adds that this is an international competition because: ‚ÄúWe are trying to understand what the next generation of business applications will be like.  And this new generation can originate anywhere in the world. ‚Äù <br><br>  At the end of the year, the winner will be determined by the winner of the entire series of hackathons, who will receive $ 100,000 and the entry into the accelerator for start-up specialists Start Path, organized by MasterCard.  Silver prizes will also receive prizes. <br><br>  With the completion of the hackathon in London, all regional events of the Master of the Code series have ended, and now it's up to the final chord of the entire series.  The winning teams from each country will fly to San Francisco, get acquainted with the local infrastructure and attractions, and take part in the Big Final in December, which we will tell about separately if you are interested. <br><br> <a href="http://www.edsd.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/398/998/a96/398998a96bd342d18422b1dbb66a271e.jpg" width="400"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/240017/">https://habr.com/ru/post/240017/</a></p>
