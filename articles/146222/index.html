      I am looking for professional mobile developers in my team. <br><br>  <b>The background of our startup:</b> <br>  For most of my adult life, I approached the fact that I wanted to be an entrepreneur. <br>  2 years ago, when my son was only one year old, an iPad appeared in our family.  And it somehow happened that he quickly found himself in small hands.  And soon became a favorite toy.  Then there were not very many children's applications on the market.  It was at that moment that I had the idea that you can make developmental applications for the children themselves. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Results for 2 years - released a few games.  They have a small number of installs, since the graphics level is low and the development is primitive (there is no good animation, interactivity).  ‚ÄúThe first pancake is lumpy‚Äù.  But she gained knowledge of the children's gaming applications market and an understanding of what to do next. <br><br>  All this took shape in the startup KidMastermind. <br><br>  <i>What it is?</i> <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/yhvSoo0pKE0&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700019,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhiHlGH9zT69ENz6yAkXJxUSlTUiYA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  KidMastermind is an educational service. <br>  He has several goals: <br><ul><li>  Child development, given its current age and level of skill development. </li><li>  Change the existing system of early development. </li><li>  Maintain level of interaction between parent and child. </li></ul><br>  The service itself consists of 2 important parts: the application and the site. <br>  The application is based on age and cognitive mental processes.  They develop through the game.  The site is an access to information, as the child develops through all cognitive processes. <br><br>  KidMM is focused on the North American market (but this is only the initial focus). <br>  We chose this market as the most interesting.  On the one hand, there is a lot of competition.  On the other hand, a great penetration of technology. <br><br>  The main users are mothers who are interested in the early development of their child. <br><br>  <i>What makes our service different from the educational applications that are now on the market?</i> <br><br><ul><li>  This is not just a gaming application that develops several cognitive processes.  Often it is not even clear what. </li><li>  This is not just a game that allows a parent to carry away a child with something, while the kid learns to just waste his time. </li><li>  This is a whole service that develops a child, using his love to play and learn something new in an interactive form.  And which enables the parent to see how the development of his child actually takes place. </li></ul><br>  Startup KidMastermind is already 2 months old. <br><br>  <i>Now this is a team of seven people:</i> <br><ul><li>  Investor, inspirer and mentor of the company (my husband).  Experience in the Internet business for 12 years.  The last successful project is fotostrana.ru (site traffic is 1.5 million people per day). <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúI believe that we will change children's education for the better.  Thanks to new technologies and our keen team we will make it more interesting and more effective for children, and easier and more understandable for parents.  I am furiously motivated by the fact that our business has a sense - to make young children and parents closer to each other. ‚Äù </blockquote></li><li>  I, the project manager and mother of a wonderful son.  Experience in the Internet business for 2 years.  Games in the app-store (First baby puzzle, Happy Family, My Home? Baby Puzzle).  First baby puzzle - for half a year entered the top 5 educational applications in Holland.  Happy Family - entered the top 25 educational applications in Russia.  User rating - 4 stars. <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúFor me, KidMastermind is an opportunity to change the current educational system.  Make it easier and more interesting at the same time.  I want learning for a child to always be exciting and fun.  And for the parent a simple process that does not require huge time-consuming.  So that the parent and the child always win. ‚Äù </blockquote></li><li>  Designer.  4 years of work experience.  Very high level graphics. <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúI like children's illustration =) And in the process of work, I discover a lot of new things‚Äù </blockquote></li><li>  Flash animator and dad 2 charming kids.  Great experience in flash, great talent and a lot of fans of his work. <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúLike: Freedom of action‚Äú within reason ‚Äù, bright and kind application‚Äú without zombies, blood, etc. ‚Äù and interesting " </blockquote></li><li>  Child development specialist and mother of a wonderful daughter.  Experience in education for over 20 years. <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúThis is an opportunity to work in a good team of interested people.  Opportunity to help parents develop their children from young nails, inventing games for the youngest age ‚Äù </blockquote></li><li>  Mobile developer (Cocos2D, Corona SDK). <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúExperience in developing social games at GameInsight (game-insight.com) for iOS (in the development team), such as Mystery Manor: Hidden Adventure, My Corp.  HD, My Clinic.  I decided to join, because the project we are engaged in is not just a game - a tool for stupidly killing time and siphoning money from unsuspecting users.  Our games are the development of the most expensive thing we have - our children.  And children are our future.  So we are trying to make our world a little bit better by investing all our knowledge and soul in each game.  In our team there is no one too much - only professionals with burning eyes, supporting their project.  Because I am in KidMM ¬ª </blockquote></li><li>  Promotion Specialist.  This is her first job.  She is actively engaged in promotion in groups vk.com, facebook.com, pinterest.com. <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúKidMasterMind is a very positive, well-thought-out project for enterprising people.  The most important thing is that you become part of a team where professionals work, and, gaining experience from such people, you yourself become one level higher. ‚Äù </blockquote></li></ul><br>  We all share an interest in the topic of child development.  We believe that the system itself can be changed, make it more <b>alive and interesting</b> for the child, and for the parent simple, understandable and modern. <br><br>  This is difficult to do if you go the standard "office" way.  Putting people into cabinets, motivating them with ‚Äúbuns, cookies‚Äù and other corporate-eycharsky things. <br><br>  The formation of the company was influenced by the experience of 37signals (what I learned about them in books and on the Internet), as well as the experience of my husband: <br><br><ul><li>  We have a distributed team.  We work in different cities, in different formats (someone at home, someone in co-working, who is more effective), in different countries.  Since the market we are focused on is American, we want to move to America for a year or two.  And take with them those who are interested in such an experience. </li><li>  Partnership as real ownership of the company.  Each employee owns a percentage (not to be confused with traditional options). </li><li>  The presence of truly common goals and values ‚Äã‚Äãof the team.  This is an interest in the topic of child development (the desire to change the system that is, to do something useful). </li></ul><br>  All this allows us to work effectively.  We are all responsible for what we do. <br>  At the same time, there is an understanding that for the stated goals our team should be larger. <br><br>  <b>What are the goals for the company for the next half year:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  1 million young students in the North American market </li><li>  release 3 products covering ages from 1 to 4 years </li></ul><br>  To realize these goals, I am looking for a development partner.  A professional who wants to do something useful, positive, that really leads to change.  And do not write the code for the next game - "time killer." <br><br>  <b>Who exactly do we need:</b> <br>  Mobile game developer for tablets.  Professional in his field.  In perspective, the senior technical partner (the person who is responsible for the entire development and is fully involved in product design). <br><br>  I need a person with experience on major platforms ( <b>iOS &amp; Android</b> ), since we are aiming for parallel releases on both platforms.  And also with the experience of integrating <b>flash animations</b> into applications (we use a lot of animation to make our products lively and interesting for children). <br><br>  PS For recommending a possible partner, after he has been working with us successfully for 2 months, we are happy to present a new <b>MacBook Air 13 ‚Äù</b> . <br><img src="http://images.apple.com/macbookair/images/techspecs_13_display.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Write in a personal on Habr√© or skype: dreamcostart. <br><br>  Thank! <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> According to the conditions for the developer: the partnership does not involve work on the "bare enthusiasm."  At the start, we offer a fix (50-60K), the size of the interest is discussed after a month of successful work. <br><br>  We are developing with our own money, and not with the ‚Äúraised millions‚Äù from the funds.  It is really important for us to qualitatively implement the idea, and not to ‚Äúinflate‚Äù the project for resale to other funds. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/146222/">https://habr.com/ru/post/146222/</a></p>
