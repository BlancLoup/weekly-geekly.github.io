Of course, today you won‚Äôt surprise anyone on the Internet, so the concept of the site was thought out as carefully as possible.  So [fanfare] please love and favor - a site dedicated to <b>science around us</b> .  [/ fanfare] Everything that you can see, touch, watch, smell, mix, pour, freeze, melt and do a lot of other interesting actions with your own hands.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Project idea </h4><br><br>  I will not hide - I like popular science sites.  Yes, it can be interesting to read about Hadron Colliders, China‚Äôs plans for mastering the Moon, Japanese robots, tokomaks, radio-controlled flies and other wonders.  But agree - somehow this is all far away, not here and not with us.  It would be desirable not just to consume information, read articles and look at photos.  I want to act, design, work <b>with</b> my <b>own</b> hands (and my head, of course, too)!  Of course, it‚Äôs impossible to make a collider yourself, but there are plenty of available experiments that can be done literally from what is at hand.  And the benefits of their implementation will be on-a-a-amnogo more than reading articles on the Internet. <br><br>  It is this approach that underlies the Living Science - to tell (and show) about the experiments that can be carried out at home or in the country;  about the phenomena that can be observed in the city or in the wild. <br><br><h4>  Benefit </h4><br>  Based on this, we can say that the project can be useful: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>schoolchildren and students</b> - as a good practical addition to the school program.  How many times have you done experiments in physics or chemistry at school?  Yes, we also had a little.  And here you can ‚Äúchemize‚Äù / ‚Äúphysically‚Äù at least every week - chose a suitable experience after the lesson, looked at how and what to do, and spent everything (of course, there are still few articles, but filling the site is a purely technical work). <br></li><li>  <b>teachers</b> - again, as a good addition to the school curriculum.  You can choose simple experiments that do not take much time, but will greatly help in the learning process.  I think this is much better than giving knowledge of abstract textbooks. <br></li><li>  <b>parents</b> - as a good tool for the development of their child.  Show him a spectacular experience - and interest will be provided.  Again, this is the best source of knowledge compared to the street and zomboyaschikom. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Our format </h4><br>  The best source of information is video.  We immediately see what and how to do, and what comes out of it.  However, the big minus of the popular science video that is on the Internet is a low resolution.  Sometimes they barely see what they do there at all.  Therefore, for Live Science, vimeo was selected as the video hosting site, on which the videos are stored in very good quality.  The only drawback is a large amount of traffic, but this is losing its relevance as the Internet speeds up everywhere.  Of course, each article is written in detail, if possible - with an explanation of the phenomenon. <br><br><h4>  You may not be a scientist, but you must be interested! </h4><br><br>  No project can live without feedback and the community concerned.  Feedback on Living Science is comments in articles and new ideas for experiments in the guest book.  You can vote for each idea, and the authors of the most successful proposals receive an invite to the site (plus, such ideas are included in the list if the author himself does not want or cannot conduct this experiment).  However, for habrazhiteli (due to habranation selected), an invite can be obtained directly.  To do this, write me your e-mail in private messages, and I will send you an invitation code. <br><br>  Subscribe to new articles can be traditional - either through rss or by e-mail.  Unfortunately, the questions with the addition of articles and voting for comments have not been finished yet, but over time everything should go into a normal working mode. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/97580/">https://habr.com/ru/post/97580/</a></p>
