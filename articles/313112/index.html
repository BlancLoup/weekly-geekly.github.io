Using the services of a hosting provider, you can create a high-quality Internet portal, access to which will be equally good from Moscow and Vladivostok.  And at the same time the technical support team will be engaged by the provider team - it remains to think only about filling. <br><br>  <a href="https://ruvds.com/">RUVDS</a> is a rather young, but actively developing hosting provider with its own data center of TIER III level, located in Moscow.  Here we will visit it.  But first, a bit of the history of this data center.

      In 2015, RUVDS decided to build its own data center.  For a long time, she was looking for a site that could satisfy the demands for energy supply and communication, as well as overall reliability, and stopped at the site of one of our country's strategic plants, which was able to offer the best conditions.  Taking into account that reliability in the data center is important, first of all, reliability, RUVDS invited a very experienced team from MTW.RU to cooperation.  Its experts have provided invaluable assistance in the construction of a data center.  As a result, it allowed to build a data center in the shortest possible time with high quality, given the many years of experience MTW.RU. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b56/bf3/073/b56bf3073ed3b47200daf94e7e8eefe9.jpg"><br><br>  The data center premises are located in the territory of a strategic enterprise - Composite JSC, in an air-raid shelter.  This object is also interesting because it is a complex of several independent halls (hermetic zones), the rooms of which are sealed. This improves the fault tolerance of the data center, and also allows for a more flexible approach to the implementation of individual customer requests for security and reliability. <br><br>  So today at the disposal of RUVDS is its own data center, which the company operates under a long-term lease agreement, located at the address: Moscow region, Korolev, ul.  Pionerskaya, d. 4 in the territory of the leading material science enterprise of the Federal Space Agency JSC "Composite".  The data center premises are certified in accordance with the requirements of the FSTEC, designed in accordance with the TIER III reliability category, according to the TIA-942 standard (N + 1 redundancy with a fault tolerance level of 99.98%). <br><br>  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe data center is about 1500 sq. M.  Part of it is occupied by operator, household premises, diesel generators and other systems.  Available reserves allow you to quickly increase the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe data center and the supplied power supply at least twice.  The average power consumption per rack is now about 15 kWh. <br><br>  The high level of fault tolerance of the data center is provided by three independent channels of connection to the trunk communication centers MMTS-9 and MMTS-10, which allows you to guarantee highly reliable high-speed Internet access with an average ping in Moscow up to 3 ms and a bandwidth from DDoS based on Cisco Guard solution, redundant cooling systems, two independent power lines of 0.5 MW, which corresponds to the power supply category 1 and allows switching between inputs in less than one se  Kundu, an uninterruptible power supply system based on the APC solution, as well as two backup diesel generators and automatic start systems capable of ensuring autonomous operation of the data center for 24 hours. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c0d/598/450/c0d5984509a41c601f2514bd5293d5fa.jpg"><br><br>  RUVDS is known for its first-class technical data center equipment - it is this that allows us to provide customers with fast and reliable virtual machines for hosting VDS / <a href="https://ruvds.com/">VPS</a> servers.  RUVDS uses enterprise-class SSDs in its servers, and they are combined into RAID arrays to achieve maximum data transfer rates.  Thus, RUVDS clients can count on speeds of up to 100,000 IOPS, and Windows VDS starts in a few seconds. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/791/a05/5ca/791a055ca97d8bb696d2f590389ce82c.jpg"><br><br>  The network infrastructure of the data center in accordance with the classical architecture has three levels (core, aggregation and access).  The access level is implemented by installing a switch in each rack (Top of the Rack, ToR) or one switch on several racks (Middle of the Row, MoR).  Aggregation level switches and cores are reserved.  Used primarily network equipment Cisco. <br><br>  Based on the product of this manufacturer (Cisco Guard), the DDoS protection system is also implemented.  It has a capacity of more than 1 million packets per second with the ability to quickly increase capacity. <br><br>  Fiber-optic communication lines are different routes to the main traffic exchange points. <br><br>  The data center is organized reservation system N + 1.  Three physical communication lines with a capacity of 10 Gbit / s each with access to the main communication nodes M-9, M-10 are connected to the data center.  More than 15 Internet providers have been added to these physical channels.  This allows customers to guarantee a high <a href="https://ruvds.com/">VDS</a> speed: at least 250 Mbps. <br><br>  The latest equipment from the leaders in their fields - Intel, Cisco, Supermicro - allows hosting to be called reliable and fault-tolerant. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/aed/745/695/aed7456959c737f9b1b9edb05d3154da.jpg"><br><br>  Since March 2016, RUVDS has become a partner of Huawei, which allowed it to reach a new level of work.  In the data center, RUVDS started to deploy the latest virtualization platforms for the Chinese vendor. <br><br>  Huawei solutions have been used by telecom operators and large corporations around the world for more than two decades.  Cooperation with the Russian hosting provider is in line with Huawei's strategy of entering the wide Russian market. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/868/a4f/514/868a4f51477066e2d55c7272286e4fa2.jpg"><br><br>  Each rack contains up to 42 servers, and each server with RAM up to 400 GB and a storage subsystem with a capacity of up to 7 TB serves up to 100 clients. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d34/3a4/05c/d343a405c475dcd4074d9d8ea555396b.jpg"><br><br>  The uninterrupted power supply system is built according to the classical scheme.  The data center is powered by two substations that power the data center via two independent lines.  The facility has a set of UPS and DGS (redundancy scheme - N + 1). <br><br>  Each physical server is connected to an uninterruptible power supply.  If these components suddenly fail, then diesel generators will be put into operation, which will provide the data center with electricity until the substation problems are resolved. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/276/28b/64e/27628b64e213dabd185a0b2fe0c4bc77.jpg"><br><br>  Automatic input reserve provides redundancy, switching between substations, diesel generator.  It quickly transfers the load to the diesel generator after disconnecting the external (urban) voltage. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/86b/df8/6f1/86bdf86f1814b7d842aebd05729a1043.jpg"><br><br>  Diesel generator set and fuel storage for diesel generator sets are capable of ensuring independent data center operation without additional refueling during the day, and the existing agreement for the prompt supply of fuel makes it possible to further increase this period. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8c0/619/8ed/8c06198ed6857eabd50c2b3ddaff6891.jpg"><br><br>  Power distribution is organized according to the 2N scheme.  Two trunks fit into each cabinet with equipment - respectively, servers with two power supplies can be connected directly to both.  The created infrastructure of power supply allows allocating up to 30 kW per rack. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/89a/49a/424/89a49a42480473d2424c895fae5c056e.jpg"><br><br>  Each tight area is equipped with a gas fire extinguishing system that will ensure uninterrupted operation of servers even in the event of a fire.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãone containment is about 25 sq. M.  The fire extinguishing system works on the basis of a gas fire extinguishing substance (freon) and is integrated with the fire alarm system (early response sensors and temperature sensors).  To protect the equipment from environmental influences and dust penetration, a system of supply and exhaust ventilation is used, which filters the air supplied to the containment and maintains the excess pressure in the room. <br><br>  The hermetic zone is an isolated room in which a dual-circuit cooling system is installed, a dedicated gas fire extinguishing system.  In the containment installed two rows of 10 open racks. <br><br>  The organization of independent pressure zones allowed to significantly reduce the cost of the gas fire extinguishing system while maintaining a high level of reliability.  To extinguish a room, one can is enough. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/55d/2ca/531/55d2ca531560f2d2c1caca1bf616fef8.jpg"><br><br>  Each tight area is equipped with a video monitoring system, physical access restriction.  On average, about 20 racks with 42 servers in each are located in the containment area. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/903/70c/681/90370c681182567bcd2b8ce360eff39f.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="#999999"><font color="#999999">Enter the power in the tight area.</font></font></i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f36/cb9/b0d/f36cb9b0dd39c9e8a30dff51ae6d38ea.jpg"><br><br>  All containment and office premises are under video surveillance.  The video surveillance system is also installed along all access perimeters. <br>  There are four such perimeters.  The first one is a closed, round-the-clock guarded Federal State Unitary Enterprise of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia and a territory controlled by access where the data center is located.  The second is the territory controlled by the PSC itself.  The third - in the data center.  The fourth is a controlled entrance to each tight area with a magnetic card. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b02/1b6/533/b021b6533b304b6b7251b0c65aeb96b8.jpg"><br><br>  Three independent cooling systems (water, air and draw ventilation with an air-cleaning system) and a humidity control system at a level of 40-50%. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ef7/fb6/c17/ef7fb6c17c29620051b2b723f10a68de.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/aba/6bc/c17/aba6bcc17151e94666eb1cac25a63f25.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="#999999"><font color="#999999">Part of the duct and air pump.</font></font></i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0e9/c34/32e/0e9c3432e5ceb966e53f34bd1bfd0878.jpg"><br><br>  In the framework of cooperation with Huawei, a transition to a new cooling system is planned - a liquid instead of the traditional air one.  So far this technology is rather new, at least for Russia.  But despite the fact that its implementation will require a certain re-equipment, it is liquid cooling that will maximize the optimization of data center operation and virtually eliminate the problems associated with server overheating. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/eaa/acb/ba9/eaaacbba93dfc24a844374e62ced2388.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">The data center is growing; a new tight area has recently been commissioned.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">In the photo, the first stand in the new module.</font></i> <br><br>  The RUVDS data center also has a protection system against flooding and floods - the data center perimeters are heavily waterproofed, and the data center itself has a hydraulic system with N + 1 redundancy with flood sensors, plus double roofs with a special drain system. <br><br>  In the data center there is a round-the-clock work of duty technical support specialists.  Technical support is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  Monitoring of servers and infrastructure is carried out in manual and automatic mode under the control of employees.  The power supply system is regularly tested. <br><br>  The data center RUVDS is popular among large corporations - in particular, such as "Company BCS" and JSC "FINAM" and even a number of commercial structures.  <a href="https://ruvds.com/">Virtual servers</a> from RUVDS are also used by <a href="https://coworking.ru/">Coworking 14,</a> a recently launched socially-oriented project.  High-tech equipment hosting provider allows us to provide a variety of services. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/313112/">https://habr.com/ru/post/313112/</a></p>
