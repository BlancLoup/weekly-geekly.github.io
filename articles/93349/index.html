  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Sviaz-Expocomm-2010 - a small photo report</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> I offer everyone a small photo report with comments on the <b>SvyazExpocomm 2010</b> exhibition now taking place in Moscow.  My company participates in it, I personally attended the exposition turnout and on the first day of the exhibition, photos only from the first day (although during the turn I had regrets that I did not take a camera on it - it is extremely interesting to see how it all looks, so to speak, from the inside, before the official opening).  I want to share with you interesting, in my opinion, moments.  So, let's go (traffic!): <br><img src="http://s04.radikal.ru/i177/1005/a1/535a8ec37f87.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The main feature of the whole exhibition, I would call television.  It‚Äôs no secret that we are now actively promoting the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãswitching to DVB, so a lot of stands mention it in one way or another.  Almost a third of one of the pavilions was given for television (the exhibition occupies three pavilions in total and partially a street). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="http://s49.radikal.ru/i126/1005/fe/9b3e4a7ac54a.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Also 3D has become very fashionable in all its forms.  Cameron approve!  Here, for example, two cameras shoot what is happening on the stand and in real time (a delay of three to four seconds) produces a picture on the 3D monitor on the left.  By the way, there is a dude with a camera on the monitor - your humble servant. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a03/d63/e97/a03d63e97ecadd094c672e74abdbae3d.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Also the power of <s>magic</s> technology allows you to convert 2D to 3D.  Well, at least that's what the inscription above the stand says.  The algorithm of the converter operation is quite simple and complicated at the same time - it completes the picture for the second eye, based on some guided rules for it.  I even think that he is building a picture for each eye that is different from the original one - this way you can reduce erroneous interpretations of the frame depth.  At the output we get pseudo-3D.  I don‚Äôt know how anyone ‚Äî but I didn‚Äôt like it ‚Äî really strains my eyes. <br><img src="http://s006.radikal.ru/i214/1005/fa/8c89711c1a73.jpg" alt="image"><br>  For the first time, the First Channel was seen at the exhibition.  An entire studio is deployed, if you wish, you can feel like a speaker (on the monitor behind the dude you can see the ‚Äúcomplement‚Äù of the picture by menus and charts hanging in the air) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5e9/8bc/4a2/5e98bc4a2f2f59e8b91724a33f528163.jpg" alt="image"><br>  At some booth a clergy representative was spotted.  Why wandered - it is not clear.  Maybe he decided to drive the demons out of BSD ... Or maybe they have such an admin? <br><img src="http://s46.radikal.ru/i112/1005/cc/ef275ccce7f8.jpg" alt="image"><br>  For five years now, no exhibition has been going on without the participation of Chinese friends.  They expose everything - now there has been a clear shift with difficult decisions, such as: cable systems, UPS, power systems, switches.  About two years ago, one-fifth of the exhibition was filled with small companies selling all kinds of junk for mobile phones and mobile phones themselves.  Now it is a rarity.  The question is - where do they get such fonts?  I also want to write manuals with them. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ad3/e32/16a/ad3e3216a4eed7b2ced46843fb71f316.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The stand of my native uni, more precisely - the scientific research institute with him.  Bonch himself at this exhibition does not exist - and thank God, from year to year they expose only the dreary model of the techno-center, which they have been dreaming to build on Dybenko for ten years now, and a pack of leaflets. <br><img src="http://s56.radikal.ru/i151/1005/28/5ed9cfb2b659.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Interesting stand, dedicated to children.  The fight against child pornography, with the availability of porn on the internet in general, with Internet addiction, with gaming addiction - all these guys are doing it.  Even, as follows from the leaflets on the stand, they are trying to develop a method for treating gambling, using some kind of polygraph.  Just in case, I ran away from there - they'll still heal ... <br><img src="http://s003.radikal.ru/i204/1005/7e/4d1ef5838db2.jpg" alt="image"><br>  And he ran directly to the sick children.  Sick dependent children collected computers for a while under the supervision of a woman in pink.  As follows from the inscriptions on the boxes, the company Gigabyte acted as a sponsor of bullying a growing generation (not my favorite, ugh on mothers!). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/119/deb/106/119deb106c46b66b1d92211fae3d1c30.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Some children didn‚Äôt have enough computers; they were given more uniform and equipment. <br><img src="http://s61.radikal.ru/i171/1005/53/44103b3ab62d.jpg" alt="image"><br>  By the way, about brutality - Marussea somehow got to the exhibition.  Yes, yes, that same Marussia, super car from Russia.  This is the prototype of an armored SUV (completely monstrous in design inside) <br><img src="http://s50.radikal.ru/i127/1005/fd/24e2b6ac4ee9.jpg" alt="image"><br>  and this is that supertack.  What can I say ... maybe someone and an amateur can sit in the fifth point five centimeters above the asphalt - but I don‚Äôt treat them exactly. <br>  Yes, apparently, the stand itself is dedicated more likely not to machines, but to their navigation and entertainment system, which can be felt on special posts.  Some of the functions do not work, but in general the impression is pleasant.  Although the resistent faded screen is a dirty trick! <br><img src="http://s60.radikal.ru/i170/1005/de/e573091d1e18.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Traditional exhibits, which year already attract visitors.  At this stand, representing industrial PCs, they are being bullied by all means.  From shaking, dropping, shoving in the stove and in the refrigerator, and even poured with water and beating with a hammer.  Technique for real men! <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/dd1/c56/fb3/dd1c56fb3e53bbb5d38337eb68897e56.jpg" alt="image"><br>  But the "Mail of Russia" attracts people in this way.  All day long, at their booth, this unfortunate is engaged in carefully transferring boxes from one corner to another with the help of pneumatic gripping.  Sisyphus some.  Or maybe they have such a corporate punishment? <br><img src="http://i076.radikal.ru/1005/ac/c91c30c680d4.jpg" alt="image"><br>  This character also attracts visitors well - look at the stand of the Khanty-Mansiysk Okrug.  A moving and talking wooden doll is already a regular at the exhibition. <br><img src="http://i058.radikal.ru/1005/cd/a182f8774625.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Well, on some stands attract already lively and very attractive personages.  True, the message I was left incomprehensible - just sit and look at everyone, like birds in a cage. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7fd/8aa/daf/7fd8aadaf7bf8bbbc6e24639972911a1.jpg" alt="image"><br>  By the way, about the birds ... <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/558/da0/797/558da0797f04cc3cf145516a2957392f.jpg" alt="image"><br>  And personally, I am more attracted to such gizmos.  Meet the compact super-computer.  Only half a million rubles - and terraflops dohrena.  Buy, what, video homemade crimp? <br><img src="http://s11.radikal.ru/i183/1005/18/4e89c1b18786.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Photographing a photographer - there is something perverted in this.  And when one girl climbs into a fire extinguisher stand and shows a photo shoot, the second one takes a picture of her, and I, having crept behind, take both of them off - I don‚Äôt even know what to call it. <br><br><img src="http://i073.radikal.ru/1005/b0/347ee98b3895.jpg" alt="image"><br>  And finally - the most delicious.  In the first pavilion (which is square), somewhere in the corner, the most interesting stand for me at the whole exhibition was lost.  He has almost no design, on the A4 sheet the name of the company and the site address are printed - but he always has a small crowd that is fascinated by the way the two possessed - a man and a woman from Science and Life magazine - show miracles. <br><img src="http://s004.radikal.ru/i205/1005/70/d4fb91c74e83.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Magnetic levitation of the top (I wonder if they managed to set it up? If I couldn‚Äôt hang for more than a minute, the weight couldn‚Äôt be picked up) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2b5/827/ecd/2b5827ecde2fca369cc89bb7be5fa2f0.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Heron's chain <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e47/bb2/a81/e47bb2a81d515982f7d779b7c1666a47.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Beer tap and forever drinking bird <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/240/e04/e23/240e04e23884164f60e7ed2c2eef659e.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Airplane with a very original engine - the force on the screw is transmitted through a flexible loop, and the engine itself is in hand. <br>  And also - a bunch of puzzles and such things that even describe something I do not know how.  In general, the complete set for the demonstration of Perlman's Entertaining Physics. <br><br>  Here is such a brief photo tour I got.  If you are interested - come, admission to the exhibition this year is free, it will last until Friday. </div>
