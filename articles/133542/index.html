    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/53bbf93b/f89881ee/2f89ff11/0282b8e2.jpg" align="left">  I was visited by such an idea.  Technology is currently marking time.  They have great potential, large production capacities, great opportunities, and there is no place to apply all this.  Lacking something to strive for.  It seems like everything that was needed, everything that I wanted 10 years ago, has already been implemented, even more has been implemented.  And now it is gradually improving.  Everything is getting better, more convenient, but convenience is achieved mainly due to interfaces, which in a short amount of time have really stepped forward.  In our life more and more figure penetrates.  We are becoming more and more dependent on technology.  And she, by the way, now and then strives to put a pig (it‚Äôs enough to remember how people were late for work due to the cancellation of the time of maternity time).  At the level of technology, by and large, fundamental changes are not observed.  Do not leave the feeling that something is missing ... Although, IT, it seems, is in the genre of fiction, not even in a single copy.  But in reality it is not yet possible to embody it.  Or maybe they succeeded, only we do not know about it? .. <br><br>  We do not know, because of economic considerations, all sorts of corporations of dough and good feed us with novelties that are not of great practical value for the target audience for which manufacturers are positioning them ... <br><br>  Phones and tablets that are more powerful (well, not more powerful yet, but still ahead) of my home PC: all these processor Gigahertz and RAM Gigabytes - all this does not seem particularly necessary in devices of such a plan. <br><br>  Immediately I will make a reservation that below in the text I will mention only what I personally had experience with.  In particular, these are desktop computers running Windows OS and smartphones running Android OS.  And for this reason, in general, it will not be said here about so much the technology that Apple bugs by many. <br><br><h4>  About desktops </h4><br>  Suppose a businessman named Peter V. Pupkin comes to the store and wants to buy a computer for work.  What does he see there?  Entire shelves of powerful machines equipped with Intel Core i3 processors, Intel Core i5, Intel Core i7, with the coolest graphics cards.  And all this stuff comes with a 25 inch monitor at 25 ... He sees how cool it is, and he also wants that.  Only I somehow find it difficult to call the task from the arsenal of a moderately demanding user, for which four cores would be so necessary?  Do pi count on a home PC with an accuracy of 20 thousand decimal places?  Yes, no, Peter Vasilyevich will not be engaged in it.  Video mount?  Although a resource-intensive task, but more necessary for clipmakers.  He needs some information, some googling, a label to build in Excel, a <s>porn</s> movie with his family to look at the weekend.  Most likely, for Mr. Pupkin, such a high performance will be <s>like a fifth wheel to a dog</s> .  Toys?  Perhaps he will deliver a couple, but it's far from a fact that they will be so demanding, and a quad-core processor will be required for their work.  There are not many such toys at all, but for the rest there is something simpler. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/bc3e4564/09b8663b/3299cbb9/33387259.jpg"></div><br>  So what I am all about.  Of course, it‚Äôs very cool that iron is so powerful right now.  It‚Äôs far from being a fact that it‚Äôs good for every end user.  After all, such a configuration carries not only speed and performance.  It is fraught with an increase in the cost of the product, as well as an increase in the consumption of resources, for example, electricity. <br>  But our hero no one warned about it.  The slogan invented by marketers and saying: ‚ÄúThe newer and more powerful, the better.  And the fact that released more than six months ago is already the last century. ‚Äù <br>  People persistently forced to throw out their money.  C'mon on something you want to throw out.  They are told: ‚ÄúYour piece of iron is already old.  What?  Not.  I do not care that there are 8 Gigahertz and 8 cores, it is old, come and buy a new one from us.  It has 16 cores of 16 GHz each.  If you buy it, you will get a sickly profit as an excuse to pry in front of your friends. ‚Äù  Those who really need it, are aware of their needs, to offer all this to others - a good way to make money, no more ... <br><br><h4>  What we carry in our pockets </h4><br><h5>  about smartphones on Android </h5><br>  Further.  By all the logic of things, devices should become more compact, because technology is evolving. <br><br>  For example, a smartphone.  This is a pocket device.  What really?  The biggest smartphone I‚Äôve been able to hold in my hands is a 4.3 ‚ÄùSamsung Galaxy SII. And somehow it didn‚Äôt seem very convenient to me; when I grab it with my hand, I‚Äôd hold it and, moreover, get my finger in opposite parts of the screen not very convenient. And this is despite the fact that my hands are not miniature at all, but it seemed to the manufacturers that were not enough for more than 4 inches. Everyone wants to put a bigger display so that the phone does not fit in a pocket, obviously. 4.5 is considered normal now ", 4.7" ... <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/droider/blog/132673/">Some people</a> even managed to make a "phone" with a diagonal  y 5.3 ". <br><br>  HTC is also very "pleased" with its <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/android/132188/">new flagship</a> .  Seriously!  Four cores!  We have not yet learned how to rationally use two cores on smartphones, and here four.  Do they really believe that it is vital for someone? <br><br>  Isn't it more logical to focus on battery life there, on job stability, on something more rewarding?  Is it normal, when bringing the phone home and unpacking the box, to receive from the manufacturer an endless series of quests like: ‚ÄúHow to make the batteries last for a day and not to remain without communication?  How to hear the interlocutor?  How to get rid of the loss of sound during a conversation? ‚ÄùOptionally, it is also possible to have a carriage with a cart of individual glitches for a particular model, with the existence of which the user has to put up.  Judging by the comments on <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/smartphone_ru/132960/">this</a> topic, among Habrapho users, there is an increasing tendency to use two communication devices: one of them is a simple button dialer, the second is a smartphone on Android for games, Internet, reading, etc.  This option looks like a solution to the problem, but if you think about it, it is never right.  After all, what is this phone that can not cope with its main task? .. <br><br>  Manufacturers also love to experiment.  So that would be experimenting.  They would have taken and made the flagship something more compact, with a 3.5 "- 4" screen.  Would bring the device to mind, let out in time updating of firmwares, and then would take and looked at sales.  For some reason it seems to me that the popularity of such a model would be no lower than that of the current flagship shovels.  In short, we‚Äôd see how% do-we-say-who% do smartphones.  But for some reason, the manufacturers of smartphones on android do not want to learn from smart people.  Maybe they have some kind of gigantism complex associated with it, and size is so important to them?  At this rate, we will soon live to see that the phone will be more cumbersome than it was originally. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/658b7656/98f4eedf/7fcc85a8/0d4756ab.jpg"></div><br>  But at the same time, even if the company's flagship is the size of a brick, even if it has at least 20 cores, it will be bought because of the software support policy of the manufacturers of its devices. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/3efb8305/d693ffb6/e915ba89/70255bbb.jpg"></div><br>  By the way about it.  Everything looks as if this policy is aimed at the only thing - making a profit.  Of course, it is clear that everything is exactly like this, but somehow I want to believe that not everyone still doesn‚Äôt care about people.  So Google said that Nexus One will not receive updates to the 4th Android.  And most of all, the statement that the device is old is shocking.  And it would be okay from Google, so after all, many users think so.  In particular, in the discussion on Habr√© of this news, a group emerged that claimed that the Nexus is old, that the iron in it is old, almost ‚Äúprehistoric by the standards of technology, taking leaps and bounds‚Äù.  And what do I see as not understanding the intricacies of architecture and other things?  Yes, I see that these steps are nothing short of leaps and bounds.  They are many times smaller.  Yes, where to go there.  They crawl - that's how I see it.  Probably, I am mistaken, for the last three years there have been many changes in the hardware and hardware of smartphones on Android.  Here, for example, that we will see, putting in a row the various Google phones of the same manufacturer, released in different years.  Will it be easy, without having an idea about the activities of this manufacturer, to say which device was released in which year?  Even looking at the technical characteristics - difficult.  Then how can you call the old phone - it is not clear. <br><br><h4>  What in general </h4><br>  The truth is there are <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/robot/100967/">news</a> that on this background looks like, really, a step forward.  This is really impressive.  But the scale of such news is not as great as we would like, the area of ‚Äã‚Äãtheir application is quite narrow. <br>  And in mass production, the most global article of progress is the display diagonal. <br>  One gets the feeling that the rolling technology is moving, gradually <s>slipping into a dull shit,</s> slowing down compared to the nineties and zero.  And, it seems, after 5 years they will finally stop and stand still until something gives them a new impetus. <br><br><h4>  Something like a conclusion </h4><br>  Apparently, in the near future some global discovery should take place, which will set the future direction of technology development.  It is terrible to imagine what marketing experts can do if the discovery lingers on the threshold of our bright future ... <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/31c527e9/1d39fb0e/76a75899/c6c61e9a.jpg"></div></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/133542/">https://habr.com/ru/post/133542/</a></p>
