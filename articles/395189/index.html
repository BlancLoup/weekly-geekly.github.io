Twitter user under the nickname 4a.m.  made a hack DRM-defense of the game Gumball.  For him, this is a common occupation.  This game was his 683 hacked game for Apple II.  Randomly 4a.m.  guessed a secret with which no one was yet familiar. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Steve Jobs wanted a computer in every home.  Apple tried to make the system as simple as possible for ordinary users.  In 1977, after a successful experiment with the first model, the <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/191920/">company released the Apple II</a> .  Apple's first serial computer had an integrated keyboard, color graphics, sound, a plastic case and eight expansion slots.  In total, up to six million copies were produced.  Almost forty years have passed since that moment, but the community of fans of this system still exists - since 1989 <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/read/a-weekend-at-kansasfest-the-sleepaway-camp-for-apple-ii-fanatics">KansasFest</a> has been gathering in Kansas, where for five days fans discuss old motherboards, keyboards, monitors, learn to work and program on old systems and find new ways to use them. <br><br>  Thanks to the popularity of Apple II, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Apple_II_games">hundreds of games</a> have been made for it.  Engineer <a href="https://twitter.com/robert_a_cook">Robert A. Cook</a> , founder of <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/268382/">Freebase</a> and Metaweb, released Gumball in 1983.  It is necessary to build a career in it, starting with the master and receiving the posts of supervisor, manager and vice president of the chewing gum factory.  The process boils down to catching the cud that passes through the maze into a container that matches its color.  Below in the video - gameplay.

You can call him a pirate, but only because of his enthusiasm for these games there is a chance to play - these games are no longer sold, and you can play only on old computers.  On breaking Gumball protection at 4a.m.  and his qkumba colleagues took <a href="https://ia801508.us.archive.org/18/items/Gumball4amCrack/Gumball%2520(4am%2520%26%2520san%2520inc%2520crack).txt">twice as long</a> as the most difficult defense before.  Motherboard Journalist 4a.m.  in personal messages <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/read/it-took-33-years-for-someone-to-find-the-easter-egg-in-this-apple-ii-game-gumball">said</a> that all this thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/rolandgust">Roland Gustaffson</a> - the legendary DRM specialist for Apple II. <br><br>  DRM hacking has not completed the work - 4a.m.  managed to find easter eggs.  On some site he found the first part of the puzzle - information about the messages on the screen after the end of each level.  To see the messages, you need to press ctrl + z during the splash screen: <br>  <b>Level 1:</b> RBJRY JSYRR <br>  <b>Level 2:</b> VRJJRY ZIAR <br>  <b>Level 3:</b> ESRB <br>  <b>Level 4:</b> FIG YRJMYR <br><br>  You can decipher the meaning of these characters using an online tool like <a href="http://rumkin.com/tools/cipher/cryptogram-solver.php">this</a> .  The letters RBJRY JSYRR turn into several phrases: <br><ul><li>  LADLE DWELL </li><li>  LISLE SHELL </li><li>  LISLE SMELL </li><li>  LISLE SNELL </li><li>  LISLE SPELL </li><li>  LISLE SWELL </li><li>  EATER THREE </li><li>  ENTER THREE </li><li>  ESTER THREE </li><li>  EATER TYREE </li><li>  ENTER TYREE </li><li>  ESTER TYREE </li></ul><br>  Of these, you need to choose the most likely one taking into account the context.  This will be Enter Three.  4a.m.  deciphered the remaining combinations and received the following combination: <br><ul><li>  ENTER THREE </li><li>  LETTER CODE </li><li>  WHEN </li><li>  YOU RETIRE </li></ul><br>  It remains only to find the code.  The player found that by pressing Ctrl-Z again while displaying the encrypted message, another hint appears - DOUBLE HELIX.  Now it became clear that to search for Easter eggs you need to enter a three-letter code during the "retirement" in the game, and the code hint - "Double Helix".  4a.m.  entered the DNA code at the right time and received a message from the creators of the game.  It had ZODWARE code for another game from Broderbund developers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/02e/fa6/e8f/02efa6e8f3a1a14f24f1e0d8e0a67de5.png" width="600" alt="image"><br><br>  At the time of the description of the found easter egg, no one (probably) has ever seen it.  In any case, the creator of the game, Robert A. Cook, is sure of this, congratulating 4 a.m on his find with the words ‚ÄúGreat job!  I thought it would take a thousand years, but you managed in just 33 years. ‚Äù  When asked what game the ZODWARE code is in, Cook could not answer, but he promised to find a person who can remember this. <br><br><twitter-widget class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered" id="twitter-widget-0" style="position: absolute; visibility: hidden; display: block; transform: rotate(0deg); max-width: 100%; width: 500px; min-width: 220px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"></twitter-widget><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-lang="ru" data-twitter-extracted-i1551434266871751506="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">  <a href="https://twitter.com/a2_4am">@ a2_4am</a> WELL DONE.
