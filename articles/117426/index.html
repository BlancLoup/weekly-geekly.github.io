  <section class="page js-page"><h1>60 frames per second: new impressions of the old video</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello, dear readers of this article. <br><br>  I will make a reservation right away that on Habr√© there was already a mention of what I will be broadcasting below, but it was in passing and not too noticeable.  Therefore, I think it will not be worse if I chew everything and try to attract more people to this topic.  Because it is really cool! <br><br>  Sitting in the evening at the beginning of this week, I accidentally, at once on several sites, came up with interesting news, saying ‚ÄúCameron will shoot a continuation of Avatar at 60 frames per second.‚Äù <br>  Cameron is not a stupid person, that's why I wondered what he wanted to extract from these 60 frames, because the human eye distinguishes only 24-25 frames per second. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  During my excavations, the following came to light (obviously, of course, but few people think about this): on video at 24 frames per second, the image of moving objects is blurry due to the fact that the shutter speed of a video lens per frame is 1/24 second.  Accordingly, if you make the shutter speed less, the picture is several times clearer.  Thanks to my friend and his cool camera - here is a video to show the difference of video at 24 frames per second and at 60.

      I was afraid to upload videos through youtube or something else other than file sharing, so that it does not affect the quality, so <a href="http://files.mail.ru/N0S22F">here is the link</a> <br>  Also as a demonstration - <a href="http://files.mail.ru/Q360PG">cutting from the film ‚ÄúAvatar‚Äù shot at 60 frames per second</a> . <br><br>  I found this video by chance, in the course of parsing information about the subject, as I understand it, it is additional material for a licensed movie disc. <br>  Impressed?  So do I.  After this video I asked a logical question, are there any films shot in the same quality?  I did not find anything that would have pleased me as much as this video from Avatar.  BUT. <br><br>  I found a very interesting plugin for video players.  It is called the SmoothVideo Project (SVP).  This program creates extraordinary magic - it parses the video frames and adds new ones, based on those that are already in the video, and even in real time!  Thus, the video can be increased to 60 or more frames per second. <br>  Skeptics, cynics, your cheers are in vain - it works!  But provided that you have a powerful enough computer, which is logical. <br>  How can you try it?  I'll tell you now. <br><br>  1. Go to the site <a href="http://svp-team.com/">svp-team.com</a> , where we download the full version of the package (it has everything you need). <br><br>  2. Install all the necessary programs that are contained in the full package (just do not change the settings during installation and click on the standard Next-Next-Finish) <br><br>  3. Configure.  About how to set up it says in the Russian-speaking Help to the program, but since I promised to chew, I chew. <br><br>  Help has sample settings for several video players.  The general essence of the setting is to force the player to use a third-party codec, with which SVP is working.  The codec, or rather the decoder, this standard, most likely you have already installed, it is called ffdShow. <br>  Consider the player settings for the example of the bundled Media Player Classic: <br><br>  - Open the player, go to the settings: this is either the View&gt; Settings menu, or simply press the Latin "o" <br><br>  - In the settings go to the built-in filters section and disable all the jackdaws in the Decoders section: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/30/f6/30f63be6eb50ea0666415309bdc1d687.png" alt="image"><br><br>  - Next, go to the External Filters section and click Add.  Add ffdShow raw Video Filter <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/4c/93/4c935f8d9ba24b82c05ca932d317afd2.png" alt="image"><br><br>  - After adding a filter, you need to click on it, and then put a dot in the Prefer. <br><br>  - Next Ok.  Everything.  Setup is complete. <br><br>  To watch the video smoothly, the SVP Manager program icon should hang in the notification panel.  If the triangle is green, then everything is fine: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/11/75/1175755d08cde2c9b87fefbbfda69d00.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Watch and enjoy! <br><br>  PS When you right-click on the icon, you get access to different settings and video playback profiles.  So, the video works best for me, if in the expert mode in the profile settings in the line ‚ÄúChange frame rate‚Äù set ‚Äú24-&gt; 60 (2.5x)‚Äù. <br><br>  UPD: <br>  1. Here, many swear at the fact that the human eye perceives only 24 frames per second.  I asked about it - and yes, I was wrong.  Google on this issue said that the sensation of movement of the object is achieved at about 16 frames, and the maximum smoothness is achieved at about 50 frames. <br>  2. I also agree that the shutter speed of the camera is not necessarily equal to 1/24 s. <br>  3. I first of all wanted to share an interesting find, this plugin, and not to conduct serious research, I beg your pardon for inaccuracies. <br><br>  UPD2: <br>  An excellent example of various frame rates was provided by the Turbo user: <a href="http://www.boallen.com/fps-compare.html">http://www.boallen.com/fps-compare.html</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/117426/">https://habr.com/ru/post/117426/</a></p>
