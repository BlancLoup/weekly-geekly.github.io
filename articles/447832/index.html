  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Not so long ago</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  We are pleased to read the descriptions of the work of enthusiasts who restore old equipment.  But this technique also had to be serviced.  We know that the advent of computers made it unnecessary for example the profession of a typist, but maybe something has changed and already in those times when computers entered our everyday life? <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/624/782/1a9/6247821a9074d223a7b564967c39c29e.jpg" alt="image"></div><br>  Let us open <a href="https://novo-sibirsk.ru/upload/labor/norms/Mezhotraslevye_TNV_na_raboty_po_servisnomu_obsluzhivaniju_PC.pdf">Resolution</a> No. 28 of the Ministry of Labor and Social Development of the Russian Federation of July 23, 1998 "On the approval of the intersectoral standard time standards for servicing personal electronic computers and organizational equipment and software maintenance." <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Let's begin with the fact that according to the text of the order, the norms specified in it are not taken from the ceiling <br><blockquote>  2. The basis for the development of time standards are: <br>  ... <br><ul><li>  materials of study and analysis of the existing labor organization and advanced experience of employees engaged in servicing and maintenance of PC and OT and maintenance of software; </li><li>  photographs, self-photographs of working time, and time-keeping observations. </li></ul></blockquote>  It's funny to read not so old documents and see how the terminology has changed.  Who will say for example: ‚Äúscientific and technical services for the introduction of software‚Äù? <br><br>  Or for example, who remembers the existence of industrial gymnastics?  And then her need was not only taken into account in the norms of time, but even there was a position of an instructor in industrial gymnastics (also a memory from the past - the author‚Äôs wife held such a position during her studies at the institute)

      The norms take into account the time for work servicing, rest and personal needs, including physical breaks - in the amount of 5% of the operational time <br><br>  But let's move on to the direct responsibilities of IT professionals.  Let's start with the weekly work: <br><blockquote><ul><li>  testing the operation of devices on tests in an accelerated mode; </li><li>  cleaning of magnetic heads of external memory devices (floppy disk drives (floppy disk drives)), which is necessary to reduce the wear of information reading elements, damage to storage media and increase their reliability; </li><li>  checking and deleting computer viruses from the external memory devices of a PC in order to eliminate their effect on user information and the performance of PC devices; </li><li>  defragmentation of hard disk drives, which increases the efficiency of their work and increases the service life; </li><li>  Verification of local area network (LAN) lines and devices using offline tests </li></ul></blockquote>  Cleaning heads flopovodov (0.09 hours per head according to the standard)!  Who of the younger generation remembers that the heads had to be periodically cleaned (the younger son, by the way, no longer understands what the thing is shown on the save icon)?  But it was! <br><br>  But viruses were supposed to be removed once a week and only from external carriers.  There is even no talk about any constantly running file anti-virus monitor.  Only antivirus scanner.  And it should take 0.20 hours per car. <br><br>  And check the network.  At that time, the author administered the network on <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/LANtastic">Lustica</a> , where the network cables were connected to the network board by <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580">T-connectors</a> .  Periodically I had to look for places where the signal disappeared.  And what kind of figures were going from unnecessary connectors! <br><br>  And the defragmentation of disks was given (for one disk) 0.27 hours (as we remember, taking into account the time for rest and personal needs). <br><br>  Once a month work was done more seriously <br><blockquote>  For PC and peripheral equipment: <br>  ... <br><ul><li>  full disk check for viruses; </li><li>  lubrication of mechanical devices (HDD, streamers, printers); </li><li>  cleaning of internal volumes of a PC with disassembling of dust and dirt, video monitor screens, printing heads of matrix and inkjet printers, mechanical plotter assemblies, a reading element in scanners. </li></ul><br>  For office equipment: <br><br><ul><li>  washing the magnetic heads in the audio and video recorders, as well as removing dust from the internal volumes of these devices; </li><li>  carrying out adjustment of mechanical knots, cleaning and lubrication of typewriters; </li><li>  cleaning of dust and dirt from knots, laminators and binding devices, their mechanical adjustment, removal of waste toner in copiers, adjustment of optics, lubrication of mechanical knots, filling with toner; </li><li>  cleaning the nodes from dust and washing the print head of the facsimile connection; </li><li>  cleaning and washing of optical units and their adjustment, removal of dust from internal volumes for EPI-projectors; </li></ul><br>  ... <br></blockquote>  ‚ÄúCleaning and lubrication of typewriters‚Äù, ‚Äúcleaning ... facsimile heads‚Äù.  But recently it all happened.  And faxes and typewriters.  I remember the delight of the girls from the secret section when they saw how easy it was to fix errors in the typed text on a computer. <br><br>  Every six months, everything was seriously <br><blockquote>  cleaning the internal volumes of the PC power supply units, external modems, independent power supply devices (UPS) and their subsequent testing, the video monitor screens and the LCD panel from dust, adjustment, adjustment and lubrication of the fans <br></blockquote>  Disassembly of monitors, power supplies and other equipment.  Honestly, I do not remember this even in the days of the SM computer.  If anyone did - share memories <br><br>  And by the way, no unlicensed software and self-made equipment: <br><blockquote>  2.4.  Maintenance work is carried out using: <br><ul><li>  branded tool for the development and assembly of technical tools; </li><li>  branded consumables, fixtures, cleaning and measuring tools that have passed the appropriate checks; </li><li>  licensed test, antivirus and special software. </li></ul></blockquote>  Happy memories and friday! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/447832/">https://habr.com/ru/post/447832/</a></p>
