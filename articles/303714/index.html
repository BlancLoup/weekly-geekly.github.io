This paper discusses techniques for building perfect optics in the Zemax environment, gives examples of calculating the autofocus range of a camera, constructing an equivalent circuit for an MGT 2.5x17.5 monocular, a SUNNY P13N05B lens of a Huawei P7 smartphone, and replacing ideal optical elements with a real one. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Perfect optics</b> <br>  The image in perfect optics, in which there are no distortions, is built according to the laws of paraxial optics.  The term paraxial means "near the axis."  Paraxial optics are well described by linear expressions, which at small angles are replaced by linear equations.  In the paraxial region, any real system behaves like an ideal. <br>  Calculations of ideal lenses in the Zemax environment are performed with the assumption that the lenses have paraxial properties not only near the axis, but also on the entire working surface, which acts as an ideal thin lens with a single refractive index of air. <br>  Paraxial optics should be used as a reference with which the aberrations (distortions) of real optics are compared. <br>  Care should be taken to transfer the results of calculations of paraxial optics to real systems, especially when building systems where properties near the optical axis and at a distance differ significantly. <br>  A number of techniques for reducing aberrations and overall dimensions of lenses have been developed: the use of non-spherical surfaces, composite lenses, heterogeneous optical materials, etc. But how would a real lens (Petzval, Gauss, Barlow, ...) not be arranged its characteristics can only approach characteristics of an ideal lens.

      <b>Build image by collecting lens</b> <br>  Consider the case when rays from each point of the object plane diverge in all directions as from point sources.  From the extreme point of object A, as shown in Fig.  1. Only the rays that are focused by the lens will hit the corresponding point B on the image plane.  The number of rays of the object falling into the image plane is proportional to the diameter of the lens.  The more rays from the subject falls into the image plane, the higher the brightness of the image. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b02/20b/b39/b0220bb39c9a4b4998e7f8b4414a47c0.PNG"><br>  <b>Fig.</b>  <b>1.</b> Conjugate points.  The path of the rays from the point of the object to the corresponding point <br>  images on the plane of the photodetector. <br><br>  To minimize the computation of finding the image, consider the course of only a few rays, for example, as in Fig.  2: beam from the object along the optical axis;  the beam passing through the center of the lens and the beam parallel to the optical axis, refracted by the lens and passing through the main focus of the lens (point F on the optical axis). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8a3/aa4/386/8a3aa4386e9c44b88d7de81345f36b8a.PNG"><br>  <b>Fig.</b>  <b>2.</b> Minimum constructions for finding the distance to the image plane, image size and lens magnification.  For paraxial optics, the longitudinal increase (due to distances) is equal to the square of the linear increase (perpendicular to the axis), and the angular increase is inversely proportional to the linear. <br><br>  <b>Communication distance to the subject and image.</b>  <b>Depth of field</b> <br>  The construction of the relationship between the focusing zone of the lens and the depth of field in the space of objects [1] is shown in Fig.  3. When the distance to the object is infinite, the plane of the focused image passes through the main focus (the displacement of the image plane relative to the focus is zero).  The minimum depth of field in the space of objects is achieved at the maximum distance of the image plane (in the focus area) relative to the main focus. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b86/b9b/e7a/b86b9be7a6f84daca5d7fd8755f3e1c4.PNG"><br>  <b>Fig.</b>  <b>3.</b> The relationship between the focus area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe lens and the depth of field in the space of objects. <br><br>  <b>Zemax design environment features</b> <br>  The Zemax environment functions most commonly used in the design of optical systems are assigned to individual buttons on the main menu.  The purpose of these buttons is shown in Fig.  four. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c38/fe7/12e/c38fe712e7e5497bab841cb63c009b73.PNG"><br>  <b>Fig.</b>  <b>4.</b> Zemax program interface. <br><br>  The types of surfaces of elements of optical systems, the radii of surfaces, the distances between elements and other parameters are entered into an editor table, in which each row contains the parameters of one element.  The connection of the parameters of the table and elements of the optical scheme is shown on the example  five. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/065/003/b3f/065003b3f0aa4000aad408c4a8b6dc2d.PNG"><br>  <b>Fig.</b>  <b>5. The</b> connection of the optical scheme with the parameters of the table. <br><br>  <b>The perfect lens in Zemax</b> <br>  To simulate a paraxial lens in Zemax, you need to set the focal length and, if necessary, enable the calculation of the difference of optical paths passing through the lens (set the OPD mode status to 1 in the corresponding row of the editor table).  By default, OPD calculation is not performed (OPD status is zero [2]). <br>  We construct an ideal lens in Zemax, for example, with an entrance pupil diameter of 10 mm and a focal length of 15 mm, which collects the parallel rays of a distant object at one point. <br>  1. Open a new table: menu&gt; button <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/42b/fd4/232/42bfd423211d42dd92c01ad277a01f17.PNG"><br>  <b>Fig.</b>  <b>6.

The Layout diagram does not show the rays to the left of the ideal lens (highlighted in red) coming from an object located at an infinite distance, which is designated as Infinity in the Thickness column of the OBJ zero line of the table.

The lens of the smartphone consists of five plastic elements.  An example of a composite lens is shown in Fig.  sixteen. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/29e/33b/adf/29e33badf5394c108330314b9b7e77bd.PNG"><br>  <b>Fig.</b>  <b>15.</b> Dimensions [3] and photographs of the SUNNY P13N05B camera with a SONY IMX214 13 MP photodiode array.  1. - camera module with photodiode array;  2- camera lens;  3 - autofocus drive coil - moving the lens relative to the sensor matrix. <br><br>  The camera P13N05B has the following characteristics. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Lens size: 1/3 " <br>  ‚Ä¢ Size of photodiode array: 6.1 mm (H) √ó 4.5 mm (V) <br>  ‚Ä¢ Diagonal core: 5.9 mm <br>  ‚Ä¢ Composition of the lens: 5 plastic elements (see.

IPhone 6 lens. <br><br>  The parameters of the optical scheme of an ideal camera lens (see Fig. 17) are specified in the Lens Data Editor table and in the windows of the Zemax main menu buttons.  The function selected from the list of functions of the selected cell in the Thickness column of the table automatically sets the best distance between the lens and the image.  To construct the best image of an object distant to an infinite distance, the plane of the photoreceiver must pass through the point of the main focus at a distance of 3.79 mm from the lens. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/90c/981/98a/90c98198a43247fa8786830344c9882e.PNG"><br>  <b>Fig.</b>  <b>17.</b> Optical scheme of a paraxial lens of a photographic lens.  Item removed to infinite distance. <br><br>  Moving the object to the lens by 10 mm while maintaining the viewing angle of 76 ¬∞ / 2 in the Field Data window (Fig. 18) increased the distance between the lens and the image to 6.10 mm.  Therefore, the change in autofocus when an object approaches from infinity to 10 mm is 2.31 mm (like 6.10 mm - 3.79 mm). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7c7/c85/1b2/7c7c851b2bfe439eba34f983ddccf7b9.PNG"><br>  <b>Fig.</b>  <b>18.</b> Building rays from an object located 10 mm from the paraxial lens of the camera and finding the position of the autofocus. <br><br>  In the specification of the camera P13N05B indicated that the depth of field in the space of objects is in the range from 7 cm to ‚àû (infinity).  Set the object at a minimum distance of 70 mm from the lens aperture.  Zemax sets the distance between the lens and the image plane of 4 mm (see the selected cell of the table in Fig. 19).  Thus, to build a high-quality image of an object located in the zone from 7 cm to ‚àû, it is required to change the distance between the lens and the photosensor from 4 to 3.79 mm.  The required 0.21mm change is covered by a 0.24 mm camera autofocus range. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/613/032/474/6130324741544089b12b40f990b81309.PNG"><br>  <b>Fig.</b>  <b>19.</b> The distance to the image is 4 mm when the distance to the object is 70 mm.  The focal length of the lens is 3.79 mm. <br><br>  <b>Dependence of the focus range on the focal length of the lens</b> <br>  Focusing area depends not only on the distance to the subject, but also on the main focus of the lens (lens).  In Fig.  20 shows the geometry of finding focus areas for lenses with the main focus F1 = 7.5 mm and F2 = 19 mm and the positions of the object in the range AB = 35 ... 52 mm.  To adjust the sharpness with the lens F1, you need to change the distance between the main focus of the lens and the image plane in the 0.8 mm range, whereas for the lens with F2, this range increased to 12 mm. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/893/d56/323/893d56323b734c778c6c9847271f1e2f.PNG"><br>  <b>Fig.</b>  <b>20.</b> An example of building focus areas for lenses with different focal lengths F1 and F2. <br><br>  <b>Ideal telescopes</b> <br>  The comparative dimensions of the Kepler and Galileo telescopes for the same magnification F1 / F2 are shown in Fig.  21.
