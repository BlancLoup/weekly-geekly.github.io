And only two (!!) products of protection cursed - Avira Antivir from the Germans from Avira GmbH and the Webmaster-Gateway firewall.  However, I already <font>wrote</font> wrote about it.  Of these two products, antivirus, and with that free, is only Avira. <font><br></font> <br>  for now download and read further: <br>  links and instructions <br><a name="habracut"></a><br> <a title="Download.com - Click here to start downloading the file" href="http%253A%252F%252Fwww.download.com%252FAvira-AntiVir-PersonalEdition-Classic%252F3000-2239_4-10322935.html%253Fpart%253Ddl-10322935%2526subj%253Ddl%2526tag%253Dbutton"><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="http://www.free-av.com/images/content/portals/5_anim_button.gif"></a> <br>  Mirrors: <br>  <a href="http%253A%252F%252Fwww.tucows.com%252Fpreview%252F513451" title="Tucows Download - Click here to start downloading the file">Tucows Download</a> <br><br><br>  <a href="http%253A%252F%252Fwww.softpedia.com%252FprogDownload%252FAntiVir-Personal-Edition-Download-6527.html" title="Softpedia - Click here to start downloading the file">Softpedia</a> <br><br><br>  Other languages ‚Äã‚Äãand OS: <a href="http://www.free-av.com/en/download/download_servers.php">here</a> <br>  Avira is a German product that has three types of licenses: 2 paid and 1 free.  Pay less - less functionality. <br>  But the basic functions are the same. <br>  See what you do not get if you do not pay, saving 20/40 euros. <br><ul><li>  Spyware and adware protection - there are free specialized programs. </li><li>  Firewall - I think, if you have a stolen antivirus stolen or not at all, you don‚Äôt even know what it is or you‚Äôll have enough of the standard one.  Again - there are free analogues. </li><li>  Antispam and phishing, WebGuard, protection against email viruses - either we are looking for free counterparts, </li><li>  Fast updates from the premium server - I have a normal speed with me.  And for premiums they pay always and everywhere. </li><li>  Data BackUp and the creation of Rescue-CD - in my opinion, this is not an antivirus profile, and there are a lot of specialized software. </li><li>  Game Mode - well, it should not provide it for free </li><li>  A donation of 5 Euro for the Auerbach Foundation is perhaps the most significant loss due to the free product. </li></ul>

      So, the file downloaded. <br>  1. Avira is friendly with other antiviruses and therefore it can be installed in parallel with them.  Can.  But does everyone need it? :): <br>  2. It is almost not gluttonous: 1 MB of RAM during tracking and about 25 when scanning the entire system.  Her most gluttony comes at the time of the update :): <br>  3. It is updated every day (or rather, when you specify in the scheduler).  What does it mean?  Every day new information about viruses arrives, signature databases are updated, by which viruses can be recognized, and so on.  The more often you update the database - the less risk of picking up the "novelty". <br>  4. She is moderately fast (in my opinion). <br><br>  Today I ran a scan of all the logical drives, that is, this is all: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8d8/14e/00f/8d814e00f97507121d608734ea4f184f.jpg"><br><br>  Outcome: (after six months of non-scanning the system in general)) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7d7/618/608/7d7618608b7e94fee4729d1c53b9b7b4.jpg"><br><br>  Not bad, huh? <br><br>  How to know that you are protected when you put avira? <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d18/f06/533/d18f06533df703e4932b2679ecb71281.jpg">  - open umbrella.  Here is a sign of work.  If it is closed: <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8a9/493/b55/8a9493b555eee2450cf8343aab951290.jpg">  , the antivirus does not monitor your activity. <br><br>  Now (after all, we have already installed an antivirus?) Double click on the umbrella.  The program itself opens. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/150/bc7/3f5/150bc73f59077c286fd1e9ac5a656bf5.jpg"><br>  Here we see whether the umbrella is turned on, the date of the last system scan, the date of the last update, and the license period, which is automatically renewed. <br><br><br>  Go to the scheduler (sheduler) and adjust the frequency as you want.  I'm worth it: <br><br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/165/ba6/325/165ba632528094be8d56d97ce70cdb00.jpg"><br><br>  Of course, you can scan the entire system once a day / week, etc., but that‚Äôs fine with me. <br>  (The links should be opened correctly, but not poked anywhere). <br><br>  The only "disadvantage" of free product is advertising.  Well, it says loudly.  Just after each update we are offered to purchase a paid product of their production) We poke on the informer OK and that's it) <br><br>  : PS: I have been on Avira for 3 or 4 years. Neither on one computer, nor on 1 OS.  And whist, and, and about, and home.  And on the hospital, and on the laptops. <br>  Demolished the system only because of the incorrectly removed firewall and the inoperability of ICQ)) + when moving to other screws. <br><br>  By the way, regarding the deletion of Avira and other programs: it is NOT necessary to delete them by means of the delete folder with the program. <br>  Start - Control Panel - Add or Remove Programs.  Everything. <br>  <a href="http://www.lexincorp.ru/post75970300/">¬©</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/26042/">https://habr.com/ru/post/26042/</a></p>
