The laws of thermodynamics can not be neglected.  Looking from the same dungeon, I would add to the objections of opponents a few more difficulties: keeping it at a given height and managing the structure in changing air flows, coordinating the location of the Aero Hydroelectric Station with the authorities responsible for air traffic safety, adjusting the device to changing weather conditions, times day and year and much more.  The project, to put it mildly, was not worked out very carefully.

      Nevertheless, the essence of the project seems to me rational.  It's not about the laws of thermodynamics or even more revered law of conservation of energy.  The beauty of the project is that it embodies the dream of every free person to have their own source of energy and water, independent of monopolies and other people who are not close to him. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h5>  And yet it spins! </h5><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/61e/608/07e/61e60807e9f110eb74f97bf15a301eee.jpg"><br><br>  Impossible according to the proposed scheme?  Yes, I agree.  But, dear opponents, you will agree with what nature does IT.  True, for this she organized the clouds, built mountains, glaciers, invented the seasons and other tricks, as a result of which she regularly supplied flora and fauna with fresh water flows.  We, the most sophisticated representatives of the fauna, have learned to extract concentrated energy from these streams.  Why don't we learn to create the threads themselves?  What is not a noble goal? <br><br>  The publications mentioned coincided surprisingly with my <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/143152/">‚ÄúWhat is the power of innovation overcoming?‚Äù</a> .  Expressing bewilderment about the irrational behavior of conscientious janitors, and hiding behind the authority of K.E.  Tsiolkovsky, I join the assessment of the genius there: <i>‚ÄúThe general dissatisfaction of the people affected by the living is supported by scientists and specialists, as it affects them.</i>  <i>The stagnancy of thought, and the vulgar ideas of others prevent them from penetrating into new trends and making an impartial assessment to them, ‚Äù</i> and thus explains the irrationality of the janitors.  Tsiolkovsky in the quoted article <a href="http://zhalevich.com/myschlenie/83-creatyve/413-geniy-sredi-ludey.pdf/">"Genius among the people"</a> examines the example of the introduction of railways. <br><br>  The project of AirHES in terms of size, scale and technical complexity is equal, if it does not exceed the project of organization of railway communication.  Will not we find ourselves after some time among the ‚Äúpeople hurt‚Äù, observing how the idea is realized ‚Äúsomewhere there‚Äù?  As now we are observing the implementation of ‚Äúthere‚Äù projects for the extraction of electricity from wind, tides, waves and underground heat.  Or is it more pleasant for us to freeze in pride for involvement in the ‚Äúenergy empire‚Äù, while marveling at the same time in search of a national idea? <br><br><h5>  Social science thermodynamics </h5><br>  Let me say that any idea is realizable, if it is in the public interest and does not contradict the laws of nature.  The ability to receive electricity and fresh water, regardless of natural monopolies, is not just meeting the interests of society, it is the dream of millions.  The basis of the project Aero hydroelectric station based on known natural phenomena.  The process of condensation of water vapor, which is not feasible in an equilibrium closed system (limiting which, the opponents have smashed the arguments of the authors), is carried out in nature due to the non-equilibrium environment.  No one bothers us and take advantage of natural air currents and temperature changes.  Accordingly, I do not find a single reason why the idea cannot be implemented.  Can!  - it is yes.  The only question is what means, how soon and by whom? <br><br>  Two superpowers of the last century, each of which in its own way was obsessed with the ideas of freedom, implemented their atomic and space megaprojects.  If the success of the United States can somehow be explained by wealth, then how can the success of the half-starved citizens of the USSR be explained?  My explanation: the governments of the superpowers managed to concentrate the efforts of the nations on the implementation of socially significant ideas. <br><br>  The leaders of the superpowers did not even dream of the opportunities that the Society has today.  Their ways of concentrating their efforts were based on industrial corporations, since there was nothing else at their disposal.  Even today, governments traditionally rely on corporations, having forgotten about ideas, and the new opportunities of the Society go on the Facebook whistle. <br><br><h5>  Activity </h5><br>  But a new era is coming.  <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a> shows that the Society is able not only to share photos and likes, but also to create a global knowledge base.  <a href="http://imhonet.ru/">Imkhonet</a> develops technologies for the formation of communities according to mental characteristics.  <a href="http://free-lance.ru/">Freelance</a> allows you to quickly and with minimal cost to obtain the products of intellectual activity.  <a href="http://kickstarter.com/">Kickstarter</a> demonstrates amazing successes in technology of national financing.  <a href="http://quirky.com/">QUIRKY</a> perfectly materializes social engineering, bringing to the market two products a week.  <a href="https://www.capitaller.ru/">WebMoney Transfer</a> provides opportunities for popular project sharing.  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/">Habrahabr</a> convincingly proves that a social network can be a place for meaningful discussion of serious issues.  The list is far from complete, and I cite it only to illustrate the possibilities of organizing activities. <br><br>  The possibilities of applying <a href="http://ng.ru/economics/2012-04-19/2_kraudsorsing.html">‚Äúthe most modern technologies, including the so-called crowdsourcing‚Äù</a> come into fashion at the very top of the vertical of power.  So why wouldn‚Äôt the color of IT specialists gathered at Habrahabr create a ‚Äúthinking ocean‚Äù capable of materializing promising designs of humanity? <br><br><h5>  <b>Solaris</b> </h5><br>  It remains to make one step that will allow the Society to implement any projects with the help of a thinking ocean.  The new public institution that will emerge as a result of this step will not only provide the capabilities of the listed services, but also provide all stages of project implementation: <br>  ‚Ä¢ identification of consumer requests, specification of expectations; <br>  ‚Ä¢ accumulation of special knowledge on the topics of proposed projects; <br>  ‚Ä¢ setting inventive problems, advancing ideas and technical solutions; <br>  ‚Ä¢ formation of teams of initiators from compatible unicums; <br>  ‚Ä¢ consumer design combined with the definition of market capacity; <br>  ‚Ä¢ expansion of teams to project and attraction of primary investments; <br>  ‚Ä¢ development and manufacture of prototypes; <br>  ‚Ä¢ experimental performance check; <br>  ‚Ä¢ institutionalization of projects in organizational and legal forms; <br>  ‚Ä¢ industrial investment and implementation. <br><br>  The public interest will be supported by the possibility of monitoring the progress of projects at all stages: from identifying needs to implementation.  Efficiency will be ensured by open competition of ideas for supporters, "violent" - for places in the teams of initiators, specialists - for contracts, enterprises - for orders, money - for growth opportunities.  In the same way as habrazhitel productivity is estimated by habrasila, the intellectual contributions of various project participants will be expressed in certain ‚Äúgingerbread‚Äù, which, if desired, can be converted into banknotes and vice versa.  I note in passing, it seems to me that Habrahabr is the most suitable basis for the deployment of such an institution, but I will not develop this idea in order not to fall into the heresy of neophyteism. <br>  If habra people express interest and readiness to continue the discussion of the topic, I will be happy to state my understanding of the methods and means of ensuring the effectiveness of Solaris. <br><br><h5>  So what do we do with Aero Hydro? </h5><br>  I propose to ‚ÄúStrengthen it with an anchor cable and put it on Hugo Boss,‚Äù namely, to accept the theme as the first wish of mankind to Solaris.  The direction is attractive because the benefits of the introduction are clear to every housewife, and the multiplicity of technical solutions creates an extensive competitive field for all interested: from the producers of electric generators to the inventors of airships.  It seems to me that the intellectual and activity potential of habrazhitel will allow to create Solaris faster than the development of the Aero Hydroelectric Power Plant will be promoted. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/143537/">https://habr.com/ru/post/143537/</a></p>
