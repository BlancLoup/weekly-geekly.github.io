  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Artemy Troitsky: "The future of music is beyond the Internet."</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Do you want to sing the composition of The Beatles in a company with a guitar?  Purchase a license - even McCartney himself can no longer perform a number of his own songs, since Michael Jackson bought the copyright to them.  Listen to music in a taxi or restaurant?  It is a matter of jurisdiction if the taxi driver or the owner of the catering establishment did not pay Madonna, George Michael, Andrei Makarevich ... Public reproduction of the phonogram is prohibited!  And if the music sounds from your site - a fine of up to 500,000 rubles.  What comes first - business or creativity?  Fighting piracy or the interests of listeners?  This is the guru of the music community Artemy Troitsky. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <strong>- Artemy, what is interesting in your opinion now happening in the music field?</strong> <br>  - What is happening now in the music economy and technology is absolutely revolutionary.  We live in an era of great breakthrough.  And this is actually the second such major change in musical history.  The first occurred at the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century, when music that existed exclusively in a live incarnation began to replicate.  Then there were audio carriers - records.  Then the music went on the air - on radio and television.  On the one hand, the entire 20th century passed under the sign of carriers, on the other, of ether music.  And now, 100 years later, it is filling the digital space.  Of course, the music radio and music television will also go there. <br><br>  <strong>- CDs will sink into oblivion?</strong> <br>  - Audio carriers, which were the main product of the 20th century, of course, will remain as vinyl records, for example.  But their circulation will fall significantly.  And they will be used mainly by professionals or nostalgic people who just want to have such a thing as a CD with a corporate cover and other attributes.  As for mass music consumption, everything will go through the Internet. <br>  This is a completely new era in the distribution of music. <br><br>  <strong>- It is known that you are not a big fan of computers.</strong>  <strong>How do you feel about distributing music over the Internet?</strong> <br>  - I do not really trust computers, because there have been cases when they devoured important information without a trace.  But the distribution of music online is good and positive, since it greatly reduces the distance between its creators and listeners.  This process simplifies many things and makes music more accessible, cheaper, mobile.  The main obstacle on this path is a bunch of intermediaries who have incredibly profited in the past century and are eager to continue their prosperous existence.  I mean record companies first.

      <strong>‚ÄúBut you once defended them very zealously ...‚Äù</strong> <br>  - I was the main and almost the only fighter against piracy in the early and mid-90s.  But only then was it a real crime.  Forging CDs dealt with the mass of factories.  They stamped them in millions ... That was undoubtedly 100 percent piracy.  At the same time, he had a partial excuse.  Media prices are incredibly inflated.  For countries with a standard of living like Russia, where the average monthly salary is 10 times less than abroad, drives of $ 20 is absurd. <br><br>  <strong>- Well, today, what influenced your point of view?</strong> <br>  - Those laws that existed up to the present have been written under an absolutely specific situation.  Numerous right holders (especially in the field of related rights), record companies, various publishers and other communities simply had no place to go.  If earlier music was materialized and it was possible to hang a price tag on it, now it has spread over virtual space.  Now you can download it in fragments, tracks and even entire albums.  At the same time, unlike all these upset majors, I do not think that the distribution of music on the Internet is piracy.  Access to it must respond primarily to requests from musicians and listeners.  This is exactly what is happening.  And all this music industry - businessmen, producers and record companies - is rapidly going to the bottom.  All this is the doomed industry of the last century.  And her attempts to put the Internet at the service of herself, while retaining the superprofits of the 50s and 80s of the 20th century, are completely hopeless. <br><br>  <strong>- In the West, the situation in the field of copyright protection has reached the point of absurdity - on the street, musicians performing compositions of famous performers are being detained, it is forbidden to copy notes ... Do we have a similar situation?</strong> <br>  - Now all the legislation is on guard for the moss and agonizing old industry.  It objectively hinders the development of music, art, and communication.  I think all these laws will be changed soon. <br><br>  <strong>- And how, by the way, is the situation on the music market with creativity - what interesting things have you discovered for yourself lately?</strong> <br>  - Exciting events are happening now on the market, and not in the music itself.  The beginning of the 21st century in terms of musical discoveries has so far yielded nothing at all.  Perhaps partly the reason lies precisely in the fact that now all events are very intense in the near-music, mediatory space.  In the meantime, the real creativity in us, something completely disappeared.  Given that the global musical situation, I now assess for C grade, and in Russia for the count.  The fact that we have a monstrous pop and rotten rock - these are generally accepted things and do not have to be a great critic and brave exposer to talk about it. <br><br>  <strong>- Can a truly talented performer survive in the existing show business system?</strong> <br>  - Shows business and talent - things are not compatible.  In the sphere of what we call show business ‚Äî all this pop industry, commercial money music ‚Äî talented people are long gone.  Once, in Soviet times, they were present there - Alla Pugacheva, for example.  But over the past 10 years, I personally have not seen a single talent in our big pop and rock industry.  I remember this discovery was Zemfira.  But this, sorry, 1997 year.  And before her, maybe Mumiy Troll, Dolphin, a group of Leningrad.  Everything has become old.  This means that talents in show business are not claimed at all.  We need only gutta-percha boys and girls, allowing you to earn a lot of money. <br><br>  <strong>- Business and creativity compatible concepts?</strong> <br>  - Naturally.  And they have a lot of examples and precedents.  But the further the music industry rots and pupates, the less talented people appear not only in Russia but throughout the world.  I think that they remain either at some non-commercial or alternative level.  There are a lot of such artists - at least abroad.  In general, music has lost the pivotal position that it occupied in popular culture in the 50-80 years of the last century. <br><br>  <strong>- But the real work still can be found in the underground ...</strong> <br>  - Recalculate in all Russian music worthy artists who are really interesting, enough fingers on one hand.  And this applies to rock music, and pop, and electronics.  I will not undertake to assess the situation only in the academic field - here I am not an expert.  But for all the artists of the underground, the Internet now provides endless possibilities, which not only 10-15 years, 5 years ago, no one could have dreamed of.  Now you can be an unknown musician from the city of Sarapul of the Udmurt Republic, start your own website or blog and distribute your music around the world.  And this is no fame. <br><br>  Author: Olga Foris <br><br>  via <a href="http://freemusic.org.ru/ru/node/2182">freemusic.org.ru</a> <br><br>  Note: date of publication of the interview from the 18th of September </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/20393/">https://habr.com/ru/post/20393/</a></p>
