  <section class="page js-page"><h1>SmartNut is a convenient SaaS system of the class Service Desk</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hi Habr! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/79880b23/e7c47754/a1ba4a7f/a99124d2.png" align="left">  Finally, we can announce the official release of the <a href="http://www.smartnut.ru/">SmartNut</a> system - a convenient Service Desk class system focused on small IT companies whose main business is related to the provision of IT services to customers (subscriber services for PCs, 1C nicks, etc.).  However, the system is suitable for small IT services. <br><br>  In this post, more about the capabilities of the system, development plans and prices (spoiler: in a fairly wide range of use for free). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4></h4><h4>  Functions </h4><br><h5>  Customer Information </h5><br>  Since SmartNut was created (including) to automate customer service processes, it is possible to store all the information about them.  For each client is a database of contact persons and contracts. 
      <br>

    <div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/c69aa4e2/f2248fae/3643fd49/36094569.png"></div><br><br>  From the interesting: integration with Yandex.Maps.  For each client, you can store several addresses (in the case of several offices) and, if necessary, field service engineer will not be difficult to find the address on the map, then print the map and go to the client.  According to reviews of our current clients, there is a very lack of integration with folk maps (as there are no details for small cities for small cities).  Already brought to the plans. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/3ee426b5/00a55a3f/362e1f06/55745d79.png"></div><br><br>  By itself, in the database of customers, contact persons and, looking ahead, applications from them, a search is provided. <br><br><h5>  SLA Compliance </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/a64b237f/92681df1/17cca023/b474bd73.png" align="left">  SLA (Service Level Agreement) is a service level agreement.  It includes many parameters that describe the level of service of a particular customer.  But in our latitudes, ‚ÄúDecision time‚Äù and (less often) ‚ÄúReaction time‚Äù are most common.  In SmartNut, for the time being, you can only track the time of solving the incident / request / request, but the reaction time will be implemented soon.  For each client, by type of incoming calls, you can set a standard for the solution.  The deadline will be calculated automatically depending on the customer service class (24 * 7, 8 * 5 etc.), the standard and the creation date of the application. <br><br>  By the way, the class of service provides for holidays, which SmartNut will automatically track. <br><br>  Another important note.  We do not SmartNut according to theory (ITIL \ ITSM \ CobIT \ ISO 20000), which we know firsthand.  Many things we do based on reality and common sense.  For example, despite the deadline calculated by the SLA, for all types of requests (except for the incident), for each specific request, you can specify the deadline manually. <br><br><h5>  Processing applications and customer requests </h5><br>  The key function of SmartNut is the processing of customer requests and requests.  There are several ways to create a call: by an engineer or operator in the system and through a web form embedded in the site.  In the next 2 weeks, it will be possible to read e-mail - in order to create applications that arrive via email. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/21d97943/abbcec0e/cb1dee7f/79e8830c.png"></div><br><br>  Each application can be assigned to an engineer, transferred to another state, leave a comment, etc.  Information about all changes is sent to the email officer responsible.  Nothing supernatural, normal application tracking functionality. <br><br>  From the interesting: the application can be transferred to a deferred state (so as not to violate the SLA in situations agreed with the client), and also there are alerts for engineers by SMS (but more on that below). <br><br><h5>  SMS alerts </h5><br>  An interesting feature is SMS alerts.  Alerts to events with requests are configured in the system and come to the recipients in case of changing the status of the application, assigning responsibility for the application, as well as adding a comment. <br><br>  In addition, we have implemented the ability to send SMS messages with arbitrary text from the employee's card - this, in our opinion, is extremely convenient for communication with field engineers. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/633b69cf/0ab3e634/0b585104/8ad76de1.png"></div><br><br>  The function works for all CIS countries. <br><br><h4>  Development plans </h4><br>  We make a development plan for the system with a prospect of only 3 months.  We form plans on the basis of our own ideas about the development of the system, and on the basis of clients 'needs (and our vision never diverged from the clients' vision ‚Äî unless priorities sometimes diverge). <br><br>  The next quarter is scheduled: <br><ul><li>  Personal account of the client; </li><li>  Mail processing (for correspondence on requests); </li><li>  Engineers download schedule; </li><li>  A bunch of little things, focused on improving the usability of the already created functionality; </li><li>  File storage for downloading files and supporting them to various objects (now you can only to applications); </li><li>  Perhaps we will have time to make an API for integration with external services. </li></ul><br><h4>  Cost of </h4><br>  SmartNut will be distributed only on the SaaS model. <br><br>  Until February 1, 2012, free for all (including SMS - they are also free).  After February 1 for small IT companies and IT services there will be a full-featured free tariff (including a package of free 500 SMS / month with the option of re-purchasing).  By ‚Äúsmall‚Äù we mean those where the number of users of the system will not exceed 4 (customer access to the personal account is not charged). <br><br>  For everyone else, the cost has not yet been determined, but its boundaries: 200-250 rubles per employee per month. <br><br><h4>  Technology </h4><br>  In short: Java, GWT, Postgre SQL, hosting from Amazon.  Ask questions about the technologies used in the comments, we will answer. <br><br>  We will write about the development team, process organization, and other such things in detail in the next article. <br><br>  PS Finally, duplicate the link to the <a href="http://www.smartnut.ru/">site</a> . <br>  PPS Access to test account: <br>  Address: <a href="https://dev.smartnut.ru/habratest/">dev.smartnut.ru/habratest</a> <br>  Login: habrauser <br>  Password: habratest <br>  This is an access to an akkanunt test company, there is no data there, but you can "press" the buttons.
