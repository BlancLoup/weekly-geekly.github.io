You can offer your plan to promote your channel and we will spend money on it, if it is effective. <br>  That is, you can create a channel for push-notifications and additionally promote it and your own project. <br><br>  Many do not understand how notifications work.  The best way to show the work "in practice."  That is, the bottom line is that among your users there are sure to find those who want to do the same for themselves.  It is much better than advertising a landing page from a heap of incomprehensible words and forcing a person to understand all this.  Let him see with his own eyes and touch himself in practice. <br><br>  The bottom line is that you create a channel (if you have not already created it), integrate it into your project and offer us your solution for the promotion of your channel.  Mostly will be selected advertising through VK (in groups).  You only need to specify in which communities the advertising for your project will be effective and indicate the approximate number of people who will come.  Ready examples are welcome - the more effective your solution is, the more money you get for advertising.

      <b>Also tell you how we cope with the loads.</b> <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h1>  Startup Support </h1><br>  Many channels find it difficult to get going; there are many small projects and startups.  We can share our funds with others by promoting a channel in PushAll.  At the same time you get the audience and the channel and to your project / site.  The entire audience subscribed to your channel will receive notifications from you. <br><br>  The most interesting proposal will be startups.  We give higher priority to projects that carry out deep integration of notifications (individual notifications to service users about any events) <br><br>  We also recently made a category system.  For the "Web Services" category, the number of required subscribers has been reduced to 2x.  That is, you can make the integration of notifications and immediately go to the directory in a special section. <br><br><h1>  The terms of participation </h1><br><ul><li>  Most likely you can not spend on advertising all 10,000 rubles.  They will be distributed among those who offer the best conversion values.  But if your solution is better than others, it‚Äôs quite possible that you will get the most.  It is also possible to participate for several months in a row if there is an effect. </li><li>  We do not give you direct access to the management of the advertising platform.  That is, you specify what to advertise and how, we will additionally work out the best option. </li><li>  All conversion data will be published for general access, most likely as an article. </li></ul><br><br><h1>  Channel Requirements </h1><br><ul><li>  The channel must be working.  That is, it must contain notifications, have some kind of mechanics of work.  Channels with deep integration of notifications and / or a paid rate have the highest priority. </li><li>  Information about your channel should be on your main resource, in the form of a widget, an article, a post in the social network, etc.  Your audience should already use notifications. </li><li>  Your channel should have a certain number of subscribers, if you can not even dial 10-20 subscribers yourself, most likely your channel‚Äôs advertising will be ineffective. </li></ul><br><br><h1>  Expected effect </h1><br>  We are interested in the final conversion of 10 000 rubles, at least in 1000 users.  These are very real numbers, the case with LostFilm drew us about 600 people for 1500 rubles.  Even if the numbers are lower, suggest your solution. <br><br>  The quality of the audience also matters.  If your channel is technical and attracts a lot of specialists, then a conversion of 300-500 people is also quite good. <br><br><h1>  How to apply? </h1><br>  For example, in a post in <a href="https://vk.com/pushall%3Fw%3Dwall-113609213_136/all">VK-vk.com/pushall?w=wall-113609213_136/all</a> you can also write to me personally there.  To mail - company@pushall.ru <br>  You can also write to me on Habr√© in the LAN. <br><br>  Consider that we can find a suitable solution at any time and if it is optimal, we will most likely continue advertising campaigns partially with the same projects for several months in a row.  We will distribute an average of 10 thousand rubles every month to the most interesting and effective channels. <br><br><h1>  How we handle loads </h1><br>  In order not to offend Habr with an empty article I will describe some of our latest optimizations and observations. <br><br>  We have a fairly large number of requests to the server per second because of what mysql fails and the number of PHP-FPM processes grows when 1000 requests hold for 0.5-1 second due to the load.  Therefore, we started using mysqli_async + fastcgi_finish_request (); <br><br>  That is, when a client sends us statistics data, or opens a link, we give him ok or redirect. <br>  Next we release nginx: <br><pre><code class="php hljs">fastcgi_finish_request();</code> </pre> <br>  After that we write statistics through UPDATE - <pre> <code class="php hljs">$mysqli-&gt;query($query, MYSQLI_ASYNC);</code> </pre><br>  This script ends.  As a result, the PHP script does not wait for 0.5-1 seconds to process mysql and does not hold the PHP-FPM process, but is processed in 20 ms and frees the process. <br>  We also cache links for redirects via redis.  Over time, we will transfer as much data as possible to redis in order to achieve better responsiveness. <br><br>  We made a sending benchmark, it looks like this: <br> <code>: 2008 <br>  /: 1839/1196 <br>  (/): <br>  - 1542/927 <br>  - 400/429 <br>  - 4/3 (4) <br>  - 80/79 <br>  - 141 <br> <br>  : <br> : 15.03.2016 20:03:20.587522 <br> <br> GCM start: 20:03:20.948594 <br> GCM end: 20:03:23.883841(2.9352469444275) <br>  GCM:1662 (566   ) <br> <br> Telegram start: 20:03:25.774675 <br> Telegram end: 20:03:37.546961(11.772286176682) <br>  telegram:141 (12   ) <br></code> <br><br>  We use keep-alive when working with GCM and the Telegram API, but this helps the telegram not much better.  Unfortunately, to reach high speeds in sending via telegram will not work - we communicated with support, they said that it is safe to send only in one stream.  We are waiting for the batch mode. <br>  In GCM, the results will be seen closer to ten thousand notifications.  Since the first send time is spent on SSL-handshake - the rest send are much faster.  Most likely, with an increase in the number of alerts, we will create a pool of workers who will keep connections for sending. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/279359/">https://habr.com/ru/post/279359/</a></p>
