I received another press release telling about the <a href="http://fotoblog.by/">fotoblog.by</a> service already quite well known to us.  The purpose of the site, I think, is clear from the title.  If you have a blog, but you cannot upload images, use a photoblog!  Naturally, they promise to thrive and constantly add new features.  The project manager is Anton Grekovich - the notorious <a href="http://folder.livejournal.com/">folder</a> .  What, for example, for me is a certain quality mark, or something?  And in general - kuplyaytse Belarus! <br><br>  The court of Alexandria sentenced the Egyptian blogger Abdel Karim Suleiman to four years in prison for insulting Islam and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.  And he was under investigation since November 2006 because of eight entries that he published in his online diary since 2004.  This is the first such case in Egypt.  Abdel Karim Suleiman, a 22-year-old former law student at Al-Azhar University, criticized the country's authorities, the university, and President Hosni Mubarak, whom he called a dictator, in his blogs, reports the <a href="http://www.securitylab.ru/news/291582.php">Security Lab</a> .

      On Saturday, unknown hackers seized the <a href="http://v-alksnis.livejournal.com/">blog</a> of State Duma Deputy Viktor Alksnis.  All entries from the journal of the deputy were deleted, the list of diaries read by Alksnis was cleared, in the interests appeared obscene vocabulary, which is also present on the new diary of the diary, which depicts Mikhail Boyarsky in the image of D'Artagnan.  It all began with a scandal that arose out of a conflict with the well-known blogger <a href="http://tarlith.livejournal.com/">tarlith</a> (in the world - the candidate of historical sciences Timofey Shevyakov).  After tarlith disagreed with the deputy‚Äôs position in a rather harsh manner, Alksnis stated his desire to file a lawsuit against Shevyakov and hold him accountable for insulting the official (‚ÄúA category state official,‚Äù he called himself v_alksnis).  In addition, Alksnis tried to organize an <a href="http%253A%252F%252Fv-alksnis.livejournal.com%252F">action</a> against Internet hams and called on LJ users to work together to ‚Äúrestore order‚Äù on the Runet.  A few hours after the hacking, the account returned to the use of the deputy.  More details about this whole story can be found on <a href="http://lenta.ru/articles/2007/02/25/alksnis">lenta.ru</a> . <br><br>  A resident of Australia is recognized as the oldest blogger on the planet.  Olive Riley began her weblog at the age of 107.  Australian first post appeared two weeks ago.  In her <a href="http://www.allaboutolive.com.au/">journal,</a> she tells various stories from her life, and also posts photos of herself and her relatives.  On one of them, for example, you can see a pensioner bathing with her grandson in the pool, on the other, an old lady drinks Shandi (a mixture of ordinary beer with ginger beer or lemonade).  As Olive Riley notes, her friend Mike helped her create the blog.  ‚ÄúI tell him stories, and he prints them on a computer.  He believes that this is a great idea - to tell everyone about what is happening to me.  A few years ago, he had already made a film about me, and people really liked it.  They might like my blog too.  We'll see ‚Äú, - they translate for us from English on the <a href="http://www.cnews.ru/news/top/index.shtml%3F2007/02/27/237832">CNews</a> website. <br><br>  For the first time in the history of the <a href="http://blogs.yandex.ru/">Yandex-Blogs</a> ranking, in which the most discussed entries of the domestic blogosphere are participating, the same Internet diary occupied all thirty positions.  The diary author managed to do this with the help of 51 fake accounts in which he posted links to his main blog.  The Yandex Blogs rating turned into the benefit of the LJ-Jan-Y LJ user at about 2-3 am Moscow time on February 25.  The secret of the extraordinary popularity of this network author was revealed by the blogger danyakar, who in the <a href="http://hleg.livejournal.com/711919.html">comments</a> to the post dedicated to the unusual appearance of the Yandex rating, pointed to the existence of identical accounts with links to notes Jan-Y - the same omnipresent <a href="http://lenta.ru/news/2007/02/25/yandex">lenta.ru</a> broadcasts.  For the second month, the ‚Äú <a href="http://internetno.net/2007/01/18/zafrendite-internetnyie-shtuchki">Internet tricks</a> ‚Äù have been quietly experimenting to create official ‚Äúmirrors‚Äù on popular blogger platforms, inviting users to promote them by inserting a small HTML cod, which complements the overall picture of <a href="http://webplanet.ru/news/service/2007/02/26/jan_yandex.html">WebPlanet</a> . <br><br>  Vsevolod Gakkel, a former member of the Aquarium group, published <a href="http://polittechno.livejournal.com/437238.html">an open letter to</a> Andrei Malakhov.  Quote: " <em>I will not turn on the TV in order to be curious as you mount your shameful plot, which you cowardly turned away, fearing that they will tell you everything they think about you and your mask will be visible to you. to zombie housewives who, for the sake of adding to a beggarly pension, at your signal, mindlessly applaud how you humiliate another defenseless woman</em> . " <br><br>  For a moment let's tear ourselves away from reading the news and read about the most <a href="http://semen0v.livejournal.com/256824.html">famous Moscow ghosts</a> .  I read this text at night and after the first paragraph I felt a little uneasy.  By the way, maybe someone in the know about Minsk or just Belarusian ghosts?  This topic is very interesting to me, tell me! <br><br>  The Soup company has finally started making money on advertising in the Russian segment of LiveJournal.  The first advertisers were Nokia and SABMiller.  Participants in the market of online advertising have differed in evaluating the effectiveness of advertising placed on blogs.  Nokia advertises in the LiveJournal model 5300 Xpress music - not very expensive, aimed at a young audience, and SUBMiller - Miller beer, also targeted at a young audience.  ‚Äú <em>LiveJournal as an advertising platform is interesting for advertisers.</em>  <em>They are attracted by the attendance and well-structured audience of the blog</em> , ‚Äùsays Anton Nosik, director of the blog service at Sup, and his words are conveyed to us by <a href="http://www.advesti.ru/news/internet/2322007soup">AdVesti</a> . <br><br>  The jargon of online chats and blogs (online diaries) has escaped from the World Wide Web into everyday life.  Philologists do not know what to do: sound the alarm or just watch the development of events.  Claiming the right to exist virtual language - alternative to the Americanized user.  <a href="http://www.nr2.ru/society/106142.html">An interesting article</a> about Internet jargon in real life - on the website of the news agency "New Region 2". <br><br>  Amazing illustrated story <a href="http://msaid.livejournal.com/81110.html">about dogs astronauts</a> .  Written with humor.  But I blew a couple of times.  Large, interesting and in many ways touching text, interesting and, probably, rare photos. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.scoutblogging.com/success_study">Tutorial professional blogger</a> , such a serious work about blogging, I have not seen.  Restraining factor for you should only be ignorance of the English language. <br><br>  Opened a <a href="http://www.dmoze.ru/blog/o-bloge">new blog</a> DMOZE (Google directory, if someone does not know).  The primary task of the blog is to provide Internet users with additional, very different information about the catalog and everything connected with it.  Editors hope that he will bring a lot of benefit both to the directory with its visitors, and to all webmasters offering their sites in DMOZE for consideration.  The blog aims to dispel the many myths about ODP in the Russian Internet, as well as to carry out substantial explanatory work among its visitors.  All this is especially important against the background of how DMOZE is becoming popular among ordinary users of the Runet.  A striking indicator of this is the jump in the value of its CY, which attracted considerable masses of new visitors from Yandex. <br><br>  <b>News presenter Alexey Kaletsky</b> <br><br>  <a href="http://kv.by/index2007090601.htm">Published in "Computer News" (# 9, 2007)</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/288566/">https://habr.com/ru/post/288566/</a></p>
