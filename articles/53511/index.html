  <section class="page js-page"><h1>As I searched, and found the Russian voice for Mac OS</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  As a PC user, I actively used voice solutions. <br><br>  Various reading rooms and voice text converters, translating interesting articles and books to me and listening to them on the go from a player or computer before going to bed.  It turned into a stable habit, which allowed me to pleasantly and usefully spend time walking and long trips.  About a year ago, having bought Macbook Air and iPhone almost simultaneously at the same time, I was surprised to find the following fact: <br>  On the one hand, Mac has an excellent and deeply integrated voice service in the OS.  Many beautiful built-in voices. <br>  On the other hand, there is no Russian voice for poppy! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Russians don't give up </h2><br>  I generated a lot of searches in Russian and English.  And found some interesting information. <br>  First of all, I'm not the only one who is suffering. <br>  Secondly, the voices are really NO! <br>  Third, I found information that indicated that some work on creating a Russian voice for a Mac from Acapela is still underway. <br><br>  I wrote a letter in <a href="http://www.acapela-group.com/">Acapela</a> in English and Russian in the spirit of: <br>  "How so?  The popularity of poppies in Russia is growing ... But there is no voice ?!  Is such work being done? <br>  And if so, when, where and for what money can I get it? !!!  ‚Äû <br>  I still have not received an answer to my letter.

      <em>By the way, not so long ago, Acapela finished off-line <a href="http://www.acapela-group.com/translator-for-iphone-acapela-speech-empowers-ispeak-advanced-tool-designed-by-future-apps-in-9-languages--2040-speech-synthesis.html">iSpeak</a> for iPhone for $ 1.99 with voice synthesis of the translated text.</em> <br><br>  But I'm not desperate. <br><br><h2>  Forgetting troubles, running is stopped, robots are driving, not a person ... </h2><br>  What to do?  Maybe I missed something? <br>  I decided to create a search query using the Google Web Alert service.  Good thing, I‚Äôll report back to you, although there are still tools for creating a query, less developed than in the advanced search menu. <br>  And because of this, you may receive quite a lot of different ‚Äúgarbage‚Äù or duplicate information.  But still the service is convenient, I recommend to use. <br>  For almost a year, from the daily reports of the service, I caught two ‚Äúgrains‚Äù. <br>  There were as many as two foreign non-profit systems that are trying to develop, including their own Russian voice for poppy.  Interested I will say right away.  Installing them, it's not a trivial matter and I did not bother with the installation.  Mainly because the authors honestly admitted that although the system is working, the synthesis is still not very perfect, etc. <br>  And about a miracle!  This morning I received another email from a search engine that contained this: <br><br>  ‚ÄúGoogle Web Alert for: Russian voice for Mac <br>  <a href="http://www.z-store.ru/news/2009/02/25/20" title="article link">Z-Store: Does Mac speak Russian?</a>  <a href="http://www.z-store.ru/news/2009/02/25/20" title="article link">Yes, it already says.</a> <br>  But most importantly, the version of <a href="http://www.assistiveware.com/infovox_ivox.php">iVox 1.3</a> finally received a Russian voice. ... To work with Russian, the program requires Mac OS X 10.5 installed and ... " <br><br><h2>  Solution Price </h2><br>  The price is considerable, asking whether $ 99, toli ‚Ç¨ 99 (it is written as something vaguely), go and <a href="http://www.assistiveware.com/purchase.php" title="prices">compare</a> with solutions for other languages. <br>  It would be nice if such a package appeared for the Russian language: <br>  "Infovox iVox and GhostReader bundle <br>  (includes Infovox iVox and GhostReader for one language of choice) <br>  Single user license (non-Scandinavian language) "at a price of US $ / Euro 109 <br>  those.  we have a solution integrated into the system, and at the same time a program that can create audio tracks for iTunes and audio books. <br><br>  <em>Actually having an mp3 file, I have been creating audiobooks for about a year with the help of a wonderful program <strong>Audiobook builder</strong> , read about it <a href="http://www.prostomac.com/2009/02/audiobook-builder-sdelaj-sebe-knigu/" title="Make yourself an audio book">here</a> .</em> <em><br></em>  <em>The program is inexpensive, i.e.</em>  <em>about $ 10, what it costs, it works out for the glory.</em>  <em>My iPhone audiobooks are beautifully decorated and easy to navigate.</em> <br><br><h2>  We are testing </h2><br>  As well-known Bobuk says: ‚ÄúEverything is fine‚Äù <br>  In fact, we are promised the same, well-known to many, voice of ‚ÄúAlena‚Äù wrapped in a Mac envelope. <br>  On the PC, the voice sounds good, let's try it on a poppy.  Of course, among American voices there are voices much better, there are characteristic voices.  There are even singing voices! <br>  But we are pleased and this. <br>  The installation package contains two voices, American and Russian. <br>  It weighs 325 MB, given at a good speed. <br>  <a href="" title="Download">Download demo version with Russian voice (326 MB)</a> <br>  When installing, you will need 301 MB of disk space, the remaining 24 MB, these are several video tutorials included in the package. <br>  The version is fully functional, but with a limit of 30 days, which is quite a lot for mine to test. <br>  The installation took about 2 minutes and required registration (not necessarily mine) and restarting the computer, which is also not surprising, given the deep integration into the OS. <br>  Reboot and ... And nothing! <br>  Any attempt to start a voice in any application causes the application to restart. <br>  I try to see the "Speech" in the system settings. <br>  As soon as I open this section, the system settings are reset. <br>  And you can see ‚Äúloading voices‚Äù in the panel for a while. <br>  Probably the voice itself is the cause of this outrage. <br>  For the first time I meet such a "severe" Makovsky application. <br>  Well, Uninstaller is also included in the package. <br>  If nothing helps, then try to use it. <br><br>  And I wanted to finish on a positive note. <br><br><h2>  Summary </h2><br>  For a year I used to live without a Russian or any other voice on a computer. <br>  For the only PC program that I need for work and of which I can‚Äôt find a worthy analogue for MAC OS, I purchased Parallels (by the way, now it still has a 20% discount) and as a result I can attach any ‚Äúwindow‚Äù program to Mac, and there it is full of inexpensive voice solutions. <br>  And finally, platform independent <b>online</b> text-to-voice <b>services</b> appeared. <br>  There are those for the Russian language.  For example <a href="http://www.ubot.ru/">Ubot</a> <br>  But let everyone make their own choice. <br>  <i>Another assumption, in the long term the release of Mac Os 10.6, maybe there we can get the built-in Russian voice of good quality?</i>  <i>Given that Russia has recently become more and more a full-fledged member of the Mac community.</i>  <i>What are some thoughts on this?</i> <br><br>  <strong>PS</strong> <br>  I thought, is it worth it or not to write an article, meaning failure with the installation of the program? <br>  I decided to write for the reason that maybe the problem described is my personal rake, and others <strong>will be fine</strong> . <br>  With the filing of <a href="http://makoomazan.habrahabr.ru/">makoomazan</a> transferred the topic from the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/apple/">Apple</a> blog to the blog <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/macosx/">Mac OS X</a> <br><br>  <strong>Acknowledgments</strong> : I <a href="http://no_smoking.habrahabr.ru/">am</a> grateful to <a href="http://no_smoking.habrahabr.ru/">no_smokin</a> author <a href="http://www.softcoder.ru/blogeditor/" title="Habra editor">Habraredaktora</a> .  I designed the Habrareditor as a ‚Äúweb application‚Äù with the help of the <a href="http://www.maccentre.ru/soft/software.phtml%3Fid%3D16303" title="Fluid">Fluid</a> program and used it with great pleasure when writing the article. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/53511/">https://habr.com/ru/post/53511/</a></p>
