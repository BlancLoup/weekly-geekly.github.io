It is not always possible to find a general idea in order to realize everything desired.  On the Internet you can find many different blogs and channels of inventors of different ages.  Sometimes they collect something toy, sometimes - themselves known devices, thus considerably saving.  Sometimes, ideas get so crazy that they quickly fly through the Internet as an incredible incident or become a brilliant revelation for the refined gourmands of DIY, and then for the average man.  So this collection, it does not have something thematically unifying, but it has a desire to search for inspiration, both in the most simple things and in insane ones. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  DIY for beginners </h2><br>  <b>Octopus robot</b> <br><br>  DIY masterpieces start small - the easiest way to start learning is to start small and simple projects that even a schoolboy can do.  Such projects are offered by a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS9yqnnEhL0DlPQtK3o45bw">user from India</a> who shows in detail and step by step how an octopus robot can be assembled at home.  For him, you will need to make the motor and make 8 legs, helping the robot to move and maneuver under water.

Its body can be made from knitting needles and cotton fabrics, and in order to set it in motion, a small battery is needed.  To set the direction of motion, you only need to tie it to a thread to the ceiling.  This little invention is perfect for an atypical home decoration. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TcIP932wSSE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>Improved VR Headset</b> <br><br>  To make a VR headset you need any available convex lens.  The simplest lens from toy binoculars or a small magnifying glass will do.  The very same body of such a headset can be made of foam.  And for the fastening of its parts you need an omnipotent tape. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KCbHyw1j_XQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>Projector for smartphone</b> <br><br>  If you take two concave-convex lenses and foam, you get a projector for a smartphone.  All ingenious is simple. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HIbnyIL33lg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>Toy robot from old CDs</b> <br><br>  It is already quite difficult to find the use of old and dusty CDs, but do not rush to throw them out.  They are perfect for homemade toys that you can give to children or frolic with them yourself.  Two discs are great for the role of wheels, a motion sensor will allow the engine to wind up when your hand approaches.  Concept and instruction are attached to the video. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2c4DJ8YY2qc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>Toy boat</b> <br><br>  Very simple instructions for homemade boats with oars.  She really swims and does it quite well.  It consists of iron spokes, a pair of batteries and foam.  Blade paddle author, oddly enough, makes the cover of Doshirak. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gtWWoHE9Iws" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>Homemade machine</b> <br><br>  If you have an old controlled machine lying around, then you can give its motor a second life.  With the help of a two-channel receiver-transmitter, batteries, wire, chopsticks from the popsicle (and you always threw them away, huh?) And springs, you can make a full-fledged machine at home. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PHdtGIrSu4o" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>Portable mini fridge</b> <br><br>  You do not always want to make some kind of toys that may then not be needed at all or that you will have to give away sooner or later.  I want something more serious and adult, for example, to make a portable mini-fridge for a can of other beer or cola.  It can be put next to the computer (which is very convenient) or carry with you in the car.  To do this, you need a <a href="http://www.banggood.com/12V-6A-DIY-Electronic-Semiconductor-Refrigerator-Radiator-Cooling-Equipment-p-1074404.html%3Futm_medium%3DCreativeChannel%26utm_content%3Dhuangwenjie%26p%3DIU19216548733201609K">semiconductor cooler Peltier</a> , sheet metal, foam and glue. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mXAjgFyPqE0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h2>  DIY for advanced </h2><br>  <b>Humanoid robot InMoov</b> <br><br>  If you suddenly wanted to personally assemble a humanoid robot on your home 3D-printer, then you will be helped by many wonderful people who spread the open source code of a humanoid robot.  If the fantasy beats the fountain, then it is not at all necessary to follow the instructions thoroughly.  You can experiment, complement and improve your humanoid robot.  A user from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Shadow5549">MKme Lab</a> channel decided to build a <a href="http://inmoov.fr/">Humanoid Robot InMoov</a> and step by step to lay out the build process.  While on its channel you can find a very detailed description of the assembly of the arm and head of the robot. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/77tXnn80vi4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>Robot-God of air hockey</b> <br><br>  Do you really like to play air hockey, but are you an introvert?  Then we found an excellent company for you - a robot for playing air hockey.  He will not distract unnecessary talk and make you pretty sweat.  In a word - a worthy silent strong rival.  The video presents the concept in action, and detailed instructions can be found <a href="http://jjrobots.com/air-hockey-robot-a-3d-printer-hack/">here</a> . <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CjzSeOg8oTs" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>BB8 droid in full growth</b> <br><br>  I'd like to have a cute Star Wars robot, but is the Sphero BB-8 Droid too expensive?  So it can be collected independently, and in full size.  It can be controlled from any smartphone, it ‚Äútalks‚Äù well and the cost of it is only 120 dollars.  To collect it will need a variety of household materials and Arduino.  A 17-year-old Filipino will tell you how to do this. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-QbFvDIyy1k" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>Laser shotgun</b> <br><br>  Still not love your neighbors?  Then watch this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/styropyro">guy</a> 's channel.  It remains a mystery whether someone lives with him, and how he tolerates it.  But such a neighbor, even the enemy does not want.  And all because he collects 40W laser shotguns at home.  At the output of such a shotgun, a beam of 40W is obtained, composed of 8 parallel beams of 5 W each. The direction of the beams is adjusted by the lenses in the same way as the choke of the shotgun focuses the shot at a certain point.  And he incinerates them all that comes to hand.  You need to know in the face of the "ideal" neighbor. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iVrJUbeuG44" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h2>  Freak diy </h2><br>  <b>Ice man in the flesh</b> <br><br>  A find for lovers of X-Men.  The inventor invented a device on his hand, from which a stream of liquid nitrogen comes out and freezes everything.  I wonder if you come with this on Halloween, how will people perceive it? <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hs0lpWN_SoI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>Steampunk violin</b> <br><br>  It is difficult to imagine why the author needed to do this with a violin, but his description for the video is very brief and concise: ‚ÄúHow to electrify the violin and make music teachers sob‚Äù.  Whether sobbing with magnificence, or with horror, but you can understand it by viewing the video. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gtoegkF0SYM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>Magic instruments of a Swedish musician</b> <br><br>  It was difficult in the vast network not to encounter the incredible tool of the Swedish inventor - the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DIvUU8joBb1Q">marble machine</a> .  At the moment, he is improving it and plans to collect it in a smaller size in order to tour with him with his group Wintergatan.  On his channel, he posted about ten videos about how he collected this tool and explained how it works. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/luXd-DNgd48" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  But this invention is not his only one.  He continues to experiment and collect incredible things.  The latest instruments are the music box with which he accompanies on the modular. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1o05wMe4am0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mFfe4ZRQOH8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  On this and finish our small guide of simple and incredible inventions.
