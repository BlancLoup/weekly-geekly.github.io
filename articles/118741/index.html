    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  Definitions of cloud computing are not possible to give clearly, because  more and more be the application of this service in business. <br><br>  <b>What is the cloud system?</b>  You can try this: <i>‚ÄúThe cloud is a dynamically expanding information system that, if necessary, provides consumers with IT services with specified characteristics and allows you to control the quality of service delivery according to the metrics‚Äù</i> .  (http://www.bureausolomatina.com/node/97) <br><br><br>  The most important thing in this definition is that cloud systems are service-oriented: their main task is to provide the consumer with a quality service. <br>  I present you the pricing table in the companies.  Services SaaS.  Tariff plans were taken, which had fixed characteristics per month.  In the table, tariff plans are calculated without taking into account ‚ÄúDynamic resources‚Äù, i.e.  only what is guaranteed by the service provider.  Information taken exclusively from the content of public sites, at the beginning of April 2011. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2ec/563/551/2ec56355157dbc0af77c1b4dc767455a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/246/c88/786/246c88786be5c6cd8451270ffe6845f4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b77/69b/ec4/b7769bec474d9181cea74d2b134889d6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Addition: </h4><br><br>  <b>slidebar.ru / parking.ru:</b> the Hyper-V platform has kernel restrictions, i.e.  here you do not clear up super powers.  <a href="http://parking.ru/cloud/slidebar/default.aspx%3Finfo%3D1">parking.ru/cloud/slidebar/default.aspx?info=1</a> .  It even turns out that this is a pseudo-cloud solution, and it has limitations.  Above 4 cores on request will collect. <br><br>  <b>activecloud.ru:</b> Fixed tariffs, with the possibility of increasing production capacity quite quickly. <br><br><br>  <b>cloudone.ru:</b> Organize virtualization based on VMware.  Weak description of services on the site. <br><br>  <b>ispserver.com:</b> everything is calculated for specific loads.  They give 5 days for a test load calculation, on the basis of which the price is formed. <br><br>  <b>selectel.ru:</b> Management of the Xen Cloud Platform, which includes the Xen 3.4 hypervisor.  Limited to 8 cores per platform. <br><br>  <b>clodo.ru: A clever</b> approach to the calculation of nuclei.  For every 256MB, 6.25% of core power is guaranteed.  A virtual server with 4096MB RAM is guaranteed to be allocated 100% of the core Intel Xeon E5520 (2267MHz).  XEN hypervisor-based virtualization. <br><br><br>  <b>scalaxy.ru:</b> 450 MHz guaranteed for 1 slot.  1 slot - 512MB of RAM.  Only on the 1st platform up to 16 cores.  Managed under the Xen Cloud Platform, which includes the Xen hypervisor.  The number of slots affects the external speed of the Internet.  Disk space 8p - for 1 GB per month. <br><br><h3>  Who needs it: </h3><br>  This type of hosting is excellent coming to replace the rental services of the "iron" server or VPS.  In cloud hosting - administration is already included in the lease and does not require additional costs.  Deploying this service for the client will take a maximum of 24 hours, this is if the order is not standard.  You can also recommend this service to startups, since  The "trick" in such a hosting is that you can quickly, without switching to another platform, increase capacity. <br><br><h4>  Sometimes there are incidents associated with improper use of services.  I will draw on my experience in working with the Cloud. </h4><br><br>  I have one client with one site.  The site for the sale of any expensive nonsense, respectively, was tough competition.  <i>The client had been reading about ‚ÄúClouds‚Äù and decided to leave the fixed VPS tariffs to ‚ÄúClouds‚Äù.</i>  <i>He, at that time, worked admin.</i>  <i>Together, they counted their resources used - they saw that they were overpaying for VPS and decided to use services, where they calculated the cost of services for the specific resources used (CPU RAM HDD).</i>  <i>Lived a month, lived two.</i>  <i>This company began to grow at the expense of attracted customers from the Internet.</i>  <i>At some point in time, an astronomical account came to them, ‚Äúwhat the hell was that,‚Äù the company was surprised.</i>  <i>Started to understand and saw that there were not clear requests to their site.</i>  <i>They read the log - they came to the conclusion that they were dosili or actively tried to break them.</i>  <i>Of course, the server processed all these requests and added money to the customer‚Äôs account for the resources used.</i> <br><br>  This is the most vivid example of not using cloud technologies correctly.  I think that there are many such cases.  The only table of calculations of these parameters - causes shock to customers. <br><br><br>  The other day I talked with an interesting person.  The company is engaged in the analysis of social networks.  They rent a few servers at night from Amazon.  Their business requires servers of high power, but not constantly, but specifically for the calculation.  In addition, at night in Amazon servers are cheaper, because they are in idle.  This is how the company found a way to save on high-capacity server rent with Cloud. <br><br>  I can only advise you not to use hosting services - where you pay for the resources you use, because  if you do not understand their calculation and do not want to follow your project for days.  If you still want a cloud and the project is designed for growth, then of course cloud technology is an excellent service, but you need to buy tariffs, where everything is calculated in advance by resources for the month (see table above). <br><br>  Dear readers, the theoretical part about Cloud Computing, I did not write, because  about her and so much has been written on the Internet.  Have questions or need to complete the article - please let me know about it. <br><br>  <b>UPD 27-06-2011</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/softline/blog/122412/">habrahabr.ru/company/softline/blog/122412</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/118741/">https://habr.com/ru/post/118741/</a></p>
