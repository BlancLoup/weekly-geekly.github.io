  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Nikon Coolpix AW100. One year later</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A year has passed since I purchased this camera.  More than 2000 shots were taken during 4 seasons in the temperature range from -20 to + 40 in all possible conditions: snow, rain, sea, mud, ice, sand, shaking on a bicycle and cars, etc.  I decided to share my impressions of the use of this protected, designed for extreme and harsh conditions of soap dish. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4e2/920/dda/4e2920ddac2903f8e64b899e1b9588ec.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Caution pictures.  All clickable. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Why buy it </h4><br>  I am engaged in foot, led, water tourism, rock climbing, winter sports.  Sports were added an average of 1 per year.  At first, the old Canon PowerShot A520 was enough.  But after 4 years of use - he began to die rapidly: a bent and beaten body, a crash when the lens came out, the shutter was often wedged, it was necessary to fix it with hands, the screen was completely wiped and scratched.  But then it became necessary to also link the photos to the terrain.  Yes, and as it turned out, the compass is also a useful thing, because at the time of buying a GPS there wasn‚Äôt yet.  And in photographs for tourists it is useful to know which side was photographed.  As a result, I had to choose and buy an ‚Äúarmored‚Äù camera.  I will not describe why the choice fell on him.  Just talk about him. <br><br><h4>  Brief characteristics </h4><br>  Resolution: 16 Mpx; <br>  Display: 3.0 "; <br>  Memory: SD / SDHC / SDXC; <br>  Matrix: 1 / 2.3 "; <br>  Battery type: Li-ion (1400 mA); <br>  Video recording: Full HD (1920x1080); <br>  Stabilizer: optical; <br>  Optical zoom: 4x <br><br><h4>  Appearance </h4><br>  Pretty stylish and beautiful.  There was not a single campaign so that they would not ask me what I was holding in my hands.  And after a short explanation, questions again arose whether it was really protected and whether it normally carried water, dirt, etc.  So nice) <br>  I drag without a cover: so that you can always quickly turn on and catch the moment. <br>  As a result, after about 2 months of pure time spent "in nature" there are a few scratches on the plastic.  But since I have a camouflage color - they are almost not visible.  My under the tap, sometimes with soap every time I come from a hike or outing.  The rest is as good as new.

    <h4>  Battery </h4><br>  As you have noticed 1400 mA.  In the characteristics written 250 photos.  Looking ahead to say - in principle, the truth. But I mainly use it in these modes: <br>  1. During the day (the flash does not fire) + compass.  Enough for 300 + - photos. <br>  2. During the day (the flash does not fire) + compass + GPS tags on the photo (coordinates).  Enough for 150-200 photos. <br>  3. Happy with a GPS track recording.  Used a couple of times.  You can make about 150 photos, but only for 6-8 hours, since the GPS works, even when the camera is turned off. <br>  4. Mostly during the day + compass + GPS tags in the photo (coordinates) + about 10 photos in the evening or at night (in the parking lot).  200-300 photos. <br><br>  When using 1,2,4 "mode" quietly enough for a hike (7-10 days).  Now there are plans for 14+ days, thinking about buying a second battery. <br><br><h4>  The convenience of use </h4><br>  Well what can I say.  I put 4+.  It lies comfortably in the hand, even the wet almost does not slip.  The buttons are quite comfortable, but the place is still there, it was possible to make a bit more. <br>  There are a couple of "minuses", but for me they are minor: <br>  - It is convenient to photograph in gloves (winter).  But to change the mode or to carry out viewing of the made photo is quite difficult. <br>  - No button illumination. <br><br><h4>  Zoom </h4><br>  There are 4 times optical.  I try not to use it, but sometimes I have to.  The quality of the photo is quite normal, but with a large (3-4) noise is still visible. <br><br> <a href="http://piccy.info/view3/4861490/5c43c1b57fd1f9931d21219f584780f2/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5a8/964/814/5a8964814da6e84c77114ee858e8b90a.jpg" alt="Piccy.info - Free Image Hosting"></a> <a href="http://i.piccy.info/a3c/2013-07-17-05-34/i7-4861490/472x354-r"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0ca/608/1c3/0ca6081c3a10b0f426bc590924d6001b.gif"></a> <br><br> <a href="http://piccy.info/view3/4861517/ad781204cb4a8be50a64cd58519afe3b/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8de/1b3/39d/8de1b339d5dea9dbeea700235e03bdd9.jpg" alt="Piccy.info - Free Image Hosting"></a> <a href="http://i.piccy.info/a3c/2013-07-17-05-42/i7-4861517/472x354-r"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0ca/608/1c3/0ca6081c3a10b0f426bc590924d6001b.gif"></a> <br><br>  And it seems 4 or 5 times digital.  I turned it off immediately after the purchase, as the image quality is sad. <br><br><h4>  Macro shooting </h4><br>  You can say pleased.  Good quality.  The focal length is quite small: about 1 cm. <br>  In the evening, when using macro photography, it is difficult to use a flash.  Often photos are exposed.  But it all depends on the surface, distance and curvature of the hands. <br> <a href="http://piccy.info/view3/4861478/be7e854840810408669b11cf2dd28176/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/83c/3b5/63c/83c3b563c69c5e22730f6f111236eb62.jpg" alt="Piccy.info - Free Image Hosting"></a> <a href="http://i.piccy.info/a3c/2013-07-17-05-28/i7-4861478/472x354-r"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0ca/608/1c3/0ca6081c3a10b0f426bc590924d6001b.gif"></a> <br><br> <a href="http://piccy.info/view3/4861484/811ee6ca2e6200d4ed4216d26ba3bfb3/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/058/329/231/05832923180234568840f2e614b7406f.jpg" alt="Piccy.info - Free Image Hosting"></a> <a href="http://i.piccy.info/a3c/2013-07-17-05-31/i7-4861484/472x354-r"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0ca/608/1c3/0ca6081c3a10b0f426bc590924d6001b.gif"></a> <br><br><h4>  Photo quality </h4><br>  I use the highest quality.  1 photo on average weighs about 6 megabytes.  On 8 GB flash drive fit about 900 photos. <br>  If we evaluate on a 5-point scale, then on 3+, 4, depending on the conditions.  Albeit not a mirror quality, but you can catch any moments, always at hand, no need to stop to take a picture.  Conveniently take pictures of yourself.  Photos are shown on the map (in Google, Nokia, VK, etc.) <br>  With a lack of lighting - like all soap dishes.  Let's just say - no ice. <br><br> <a href="http://piccy.info/view3/4861500/0ab66f3b3bb428222b8b951f46c48b49/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0d4/163/07b/0d416307bdc6d68282b2e84b0fbd19f5.jpg" alt="Piccy.info - Free Image Hosting"></a> <a href="http://i.piccy.info/a3c/2013-07-17-05-39/i7-4861500/472x354-r"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0ca/608/1c3/0ca6081c3a10b0f426bc590924d6001b.gif"></a> <br><br> <a href="http://piccy.info/view3/4861513/d3fb468b97d6a50e78e3468b311a0383/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8f7/93b/fe5/8f793bfe58521c4dc769c69873d5e15c.jpg" alt="Piccy.info - Free Image Hosting"></a> <a href="http://i.piccy.info/a3c/2013-07-17-05-41/i7-4861513/472x354-r"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0ca/608/1c3/0ca6081c3a10b0f426bc590924d6001b.gif"></a> <br><br> <a href="http://piccy.info/view3/4861523/8e8ec26cc2a852f4a10b0f1dd74198e8/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fd8/ace/997/fd8ace99737624e64f29ca63bd921b07.jpg" alt="Piccy.info - Free Image Hosting"></a> <a href="http://i.piccy.info/a3c/2013-07-17-05-43/i7-4861523/472x354-r"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0ca/608/1c3/0ca6081c3a10b0f426bc590924d6001b.gif"></a> <br><br> <a href="http://piccy.info/view3/4861530/2d1a6b63051ff39ed7b8f31b75e8ff4c/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/73d/4a6/eaa/73d4a6eaabb23ea6b4f0547014ee86c0.jpg" alt="Piccy.info - Free Image Hosting"></a> <a href="http://i.piccy.info/a3c/2013-07-17-05-44/i7-4861530/472x354-r"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0ca/608/1c3/0ca6081c3a10b0f426bc590924d6001b.gif"></a> <br><br> <a href="http://piccy.info/view3/4861533/97231621a31a86a01c7aaa8bcbb04c0b/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a3e/1c8/aa3/a3e1c8aa30d65f40d956ed26d0bfebd2.jpg" alt="Piccy.info - Free Image Hosting"></a> <a href="http://i.piccy.info/a3c/2013-07-17-05-45/i7-4861533/472x354-r"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0ca/608/1c3/0ca6081c3a10b0f426bc590924d6001b.gif"></a> <br><br> <a href="http://piccy.info/view3/4861534/ce6ba6d5feb264afe14bf2399f2a7779/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/72c/349/87a/72c34987a70c352be62fc3c12c8d7210.jpg" alt="Piccy.info - Free Image Hosting"></a> <a href="http://i.piccy.info/a3c/2013-07-17-05-45/i7-4861534/472x354-r"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0ca/608/1c3/0ca6081c3a10b0f426bc590924d6001b.gif"></a> <br><br> <a href="http://piccy.info/view3/4861536/cf03fded3557247b64f92e03b9f3a390/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6a4/ff9/25c/6a4ff925ccdc5bfc8c9d512b85bc028d.jpg" alt="Piccy.info - Free Image Hosting"></a> <a href="http://i.piccy.info/a3c/2013-07-17-05-46/i7-4861536/472x354-r"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0ca/608/1c3/0ca6081c3a10b0f426bc590924d6001b.gif"></a> <br><br><h4>  Video quality </h4><br>  It may seem funny, but it is great.  In most cases.  In my opinion, better than photos.  I appreciate in 4 +. <br>  What pleased us are the different modes of resolution and the number of frames (up to 240).  The truth is usually quite useless function. <br>  For shooting video, a separate button is displayed.  At first, not familiar.  Then sometimes it is accidentally pressed, as it is located between the ‚Äúzoom in‚Äù and ‚Äúframe review‚Äù. <br>  The maximum duration of a video is 30 minutes. <br><br><h4>  Little screen </h4><br>  3 inches on IPS matrix.  At different angles, colors are not distorted.  The color rendition is good.  In the bright sun you can see quite normal, but the colors fade quite strongly.  For me it does not matter. <br>  Protected with plastic about 2 mm thick.  Plastic for the year almost did not scratch and rubbed. <br><br><h4>  About the disadvantages </h4><br>  For all the time I found only one: <br>  On the screen appeared 3 blue spots, each about 1-2 mm in diameter.  It is visible only if you aim the lens on a black surface.  Where did they come from - I do not know.  In the service center to go lazy.  This is not reflected in the photographs. <br><br><h4>  Price </h4><br>  Took for 300 cu <br><br><h4>  Security </h4><br>  All as written.  All right.  It works with frost (I checked it at -15-20, when I rode in the Carpathians.). At sea, too, it‚Äôs excellent in the heat. <br>  I dived with him into the sea to a depth of 3-4 meters - everything is fine.  Just do not forget to rinse with fresh water.  He is not afraid of blows and falls (on the floor and stones fell from about 1 meter).  Once fell on him with a backpack - also alive.  Dust, dirt - you can not even pay attention.  Is that the lens is sometimes wiped with a T-shirt. <br><br> <a href="http://piccy.info/view3/4861499/e65208f6b3d27ae1d8f641b9d4c25de6/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4c1/4c1/033/4c14c1033a85aa24a8688b353ac04474.jpg" alt="Piccy.info - Free Image Hosting"></a> <a href="http://i.piccy.info/a3c/2013-07-17-05-38/i7-4861499/472x354-r"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0ca/608/1c3/0ca6081c3a10b0f426bc590924d6001b.gif"></a> <br><br><h4>  Lens </h4><br>  Outside is glass. <br>  I usually wipe it with what I have to do - t-shirt, pants, buff, towel.  And wet and dry.  Like new. <br>  The only thing that the coating from water has suffered is a bit - now sometimes not all the droplets drain themselves. <br><br><h4>  Underwater shooting </h4><br>  There is a special mode even.  But how does it differ from "auto" I do not know.  I tried both Fota as above the water and under.  There is no difference. <br>  Photo quality depends on water quality.  At sea - good.  On the river - terrible. <br><br> <a href="http://piccy.info/view3/4861492/127fd382e7689b35499891784862b191/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/131/a24/da5/131a24da500af53f48b54fb3df9bb507.jpg" alt="Piccy.info - Free Image Hosting"></a> <a href="http://i.piccy.info/a3c/2013-07-17-05-36/i7-4861492/472x354-r"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0ca/608/1c3/0ca6081c3a10b0f426bc590924d6001b.gif"></a> <br><br> <a href="http://piccy.info/view3/4861495/c0876b49ccf1a63a582197a2dc85fceb/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/974/53f/515/97453f515986055df53965ccc9a4bf96.jpg" alt="Piccy.info - Free Image Hosting"></a> <a href="http://i.piccy.info/a3c/2013-07-17-05-37/i7-4861495/472x354-r"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0ca/608/1c3/0ca6081c3a10b0f426bc590924d6001b.gif"></a> <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/YoEAEL99v1Q%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgZ_3Zasrc3WJci1wtiHyN7L8H2fA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <i>Video in 1080p, but the download is reduced.</i> <br><br><h4>  Shooting modes </h4><br>  There are about 25 of them. <br>  There are two automatic: just auto.  95% fotayu on it.  good quality. <br>  And intelligent auto - this one just does image analysis, lighting, etc.  and switches itself from the available modes.  Next comes the selected mode.  Quite an interesting idea, but it hurts crookedly.  Do not use. <br>  Sometimes indulge in the night, food, sea, beach, sunset, etc.  If there is nothing to do ... the difference between the modes is minimal. <br>  There is no manual setting.  Yes, and as practice has shown - it is not needed here. <br><br><h4>  GPS </h4><br>  It is quite satisfactory.  Maps, though not loaded, but there is a very detailed map of the world. <br>  Positioning speed is slow.  5-10 minutes with a cold start, and 2-3 with a hot one.  By comparison, my Garmin cold start lasts a maximum of 3-4 minutes. <br><br><h4>  findings </h4><br>  Expensive ... 200-250 dollars its price.  Serves faithfully.  If you can‚Äôt imagine your life without active rest and adventures, and want to capture these moments and share them with your friends - then the Nikon Coolpix AW100 is what you need for that kind of money. <br><br><h4>  P.S. </h4><br>  If you are interested in photos in specific modes, or under other lighting conditions, etc.  write - photograph and lay out. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/180303/">https://habr.com/ru/post/180303/</a></p>
