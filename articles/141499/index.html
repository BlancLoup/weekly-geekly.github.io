  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Electronics MK-85 and information security - the continuation of the story</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Someone surely remembers the Soviet microcomputer Electronics MK-85 / 85M, but few know that there were two more types of devices: MK-85B - Banking - for encrypting the validation code (KPA) for an advice by the Central Bank (CB) of the Russian Federation -85 - Crypto - for other cryptographic tasks.  They were used throughout the Russian Federation - the Central Bank, the Ministry of Defense, the Interior Ministry and the border forces.  The devices were developed in 1990-1991 year NPMGP "Ankort" and were manufactured at the plant "Angstrom" in the city of Zelenograd. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f62/1b9/b5f/f621b9b5f05425202a9030228c25f6b7.jpg"><br><br>  Since then, more than 20 years have passed and we have changed a lot, but have not changed ourselves.  We are still engaged in the development and production of encryption technology and this year we will present our new brainchild, the portable encoder of the new generation StealthPhone - we can read about it, including in this blog. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  To make the dream a reality, you need time, knowledge and experience.  Fortunately, we have enough of the latter, since our team has been engaged in research, development and production in the field of data encryption for more than 20 years.

      <b>A bit of history</b> <br><br>  It all started back in 1991, when we made the first portable encoder, a kind of legend, which everyone heard about, but few saw it - the very same "Electronics MK-85S".  At the time of production, according to its technical and cryptographic properties, it had no analogues in the world; many state and commercial organizations of Russia and companies from more than 50 countries of the world are equipped with them. <br><br>  Our portable encryption devices "took part" in the fighting in "hot spots" and proved their usefulness and efficiency, and our encryption algorithms passed state certification and were recognized as practically defiestand in countries such as South Africa and Sweden.  Until that time, no Russian company engaged in data encryption and protection had such international recognition. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c79/bee/268/c79bee268e4e139298d395a189c03dcd.jpg"><br><br>  One of the representatives of the next generation of portable encryptors was the Cryptosmartphone Ankort A-7, released in 2006.  In the protected mode, the phone provides cryptographic protection of voice information and subscriber authentication, and also allows you to send encrypted SMS and E-mail messages.  In the open mode, it is fully consistent with the level of GSM-devices of the time.  At its base, the world's most expensive diamond cryptosmarfon worth $ 1,300,000 has been released.  For VIP customers, exclusive modifications of the crypto smartphones were issued in gold, platinum and titanium cases. <br><br>  <b>Today's Day</b> <br><br>  Over the years, the encoder has changed a lot, becoming smaller, lighter, and most importantly - it has become affordable and portable in the full sense of the word, while its reliability and robustness are still not in doubt: the encryption algorithm in the crypto smartphones has not yet been cracked. <br><br>  StealthPhone is a logical continuation of the A-7: its main purpose is still voice and SMS / MMS encryption, but in addition to this, the device has been ‚Äúunlinked‚Äù from a specific phone due to Bluetooth connection (now compatible with Symbian, Android, iOS and BlackBerry) ) and a number of new features.  It should be noted that there was never such a bouquet of opportunities within one encryption device: voice and text encryption, work with MS Office documents (MS Crypto API), crypto-flash.  In a word, everything that can be encrypted is encrypted with one device!  (Well, it is decrypted accordingly :). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/15e/4cd/b52/15e4cdb526d2ee214461bb1b847814c6.jpg"><br><br>  The two largest international exhibitions of 2012 in the field of computers and mobile phones GSMA in Barcelona (Spain) and CEBIT in Hanover (Germany) clearly showed that in the field of information protection of mobile phones there are no competitors to our StealthPhone encoder in the world market.  The estimated market size for the protection of information passing through mobile phones is $ 80,000,000,000.  Russia has a chance to take a leading position in the world in the most promising technological area - the protection of information. <br><br>  As you see, we have something to tell and show you, and in our blog we will talk about how we worked and work, what difficulties we face and how we solve them, and also we will be glad to receive your comments and ideas. <br><br>  In conclusion of our first, but not the last post, we invite to our <a href="http://stealthphone.ru/">site.</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/141499/">https://habr.com/ru/post/141499/</a></p>
