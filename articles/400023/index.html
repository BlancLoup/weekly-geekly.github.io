We will get acquainted with <em>Energomer</em> from Dadzhet. </p><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><p>  Some background information.  The power of electrical energy is usually measured in <em>watts</em> (W).  The amount of energy is in <em>Watt‚ãÖ hours</em> (V‚ãÖch).  Well, all that follows with the prefix kWh and kWh - 1000 times more.  Power is the rate of energy consumption.  It describes the device as "fast consuming" or "slowly."  For example, an electric kettle with a capacity of 2000 watts per hour consumes 2000 1 = 2000 watt hours.  A light bulb designed for 60 W power per 30 minutes (0.5 hour) consumes 60‚ãÖ0.5 = 30 Wh‚ãÖ or 0.03 kWh. </p><br><p>  In Nizhny Novgorod, my seat, 1 kWh of energy costs 3.41 rubles from 7 to 23 hours, and at another time - 1.67 rubles.  This is subject to consumption within the social norm.  Higher - about two times more. </p><br><p>  So, for half an hour of work, that same light bulb will cost us 10 kopecks by day and 5 kopecks at night. </p><br><h3 id="osobennosti-raboty-pribora-energomer">  Features of the device Energomer </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/477/a2f/4fd/477a2f4fd1344b60b33f0ad12716902a.jpg"><br><p>  <em>Everything that the display can show</em> </p><br><p>  Functions of the device (according to the instruction) </p><br><ol><li>  Network voltage </li><li>  Current in load circuit </li><li>  Power consumed by the load </li><li>  Power consumption </li><li>  Mains voltage frequency </li><li>  Power factor (I think it's <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25BE%25D1%258D%25D1%2584%25D1%2584%25D0%25B8%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582_%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D1%2589%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8">cos œÜ</a> , where œÜ is the phase shift between current and voltage) </li><li>  The total cost of electricity consumed and the time of consumption </li><li>  Tariff 1 cost and consumption time in this mode </li><li>  Cost at tariff 2 and consumption time in this mode </li><li>  Current time </li></ol><br><p>  Specifications: </p><br><blockquote>  Maximum load: 16 A, 3600 W <br>  Measured voltage: ~ 190-276 V <br>  Current measurement range: 0.01-16 A <br>  Power measurement range: 0.2 - 3600 W <br>  Measurement accuracy: ¬± 1% <br>  Measurement in the frequency range of the network 45-65 Hz <br>  Battery 3x1.5 V LR44 / AG13 <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c0a/e1e/365/c0ae1e3650634e8f8193728b5e0af498.jpg"><br><br>  <em>Marking on the device</em> </blockquote><p>  The energy meter has batteries inside it, thanks to which it saves the current time and tariff settings. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/172/160/888/17216088880b4e08b99c21336cc8737e.jpg"><br><p>  <em>Open battery compartment</em> </p><br><p>  I immediately set up the device for my life: a two-tariff mode.  I learned the cost and exact time frame on the website of the power supply organization of my region. </p><br><p>  The control takes place with three main buttons.  There is still one - to reset everything at once.  Typical small Reset button, recessed deep into the case.  Driving settings is pretty easy.  Step by step, according to the instructions (yes, I read it). </p><br><p>  Now you can <del>  stick </del>  study everything, with a capacity of up to 3.6 kW, as stated in the instruction manual. </p><br><p>  The device remembers the energy consumed and its cost.  This is reset all after a long hold on the Func button.  Pretty comfortable. </p><br><p>  <strong>In action</strong> <br>  <em>The video shows the measurement of the power of the humidifier in different modes.</em>  <em>Watch with subtitles</em> </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wENL3jpYVVM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><p>  <em>The video shows the measurement of the power of the humidifier in different modes.</em>  <em>Watch with subtitles</em> </p><br><h3 id="kak-merit-bolee-tochno">  How to measure more accurately </h3><br><p>  I did not quite like the fact that the minimum measured energy is 0.1 kWh.  Anything less is not so easy to measure.  But I solved this problem.  The device perfectly captures the price of energy consumed with an accuracy of 0.01 rubles.  Since I scored a price of 1 kW‚ãÖh in the energy meter equal to 3.41 rubles, by making a simple proportion, we get that 1 kopek on the dial corresponds to 2.93 Wh.  It could be made easier to put the price at 10 rubles.  Then the dial of expenses would show in one kopek 1 AT. </p><br><p>  The author knows about the existence of errors, all calculations are carried out within the "narrow-minded" error.  We consider power only active, because the simple consumer pays only for it. </p><br><h3 id="pereydyom-k-testirovaniyu-na-priborah">  Let us turn to testing on devices </h3><br><h4 id="kofemashina">  Coffee machine </h4><br><p>  DeLonghi Magnifica S 1450 W <br>  <em>This coffee machine is a good device in terms of price / quality.</em>  <em>Of the minuses - except that it does not automatically prepare milk foam.</em>  <em>The device complies with energy class A.</em> <br>  In Stand By mode (just plugged in), the coffee machine runs with a power of 0.2.  In standby mode, when the nozzles are washed and it remains only to press the cooking button - 0.4 watts.  In the process of making double espresso power jumps to the maximum declared due to the uneven process.  So, a double espresso cost 0.1 rubles, which means 29.3 watts of electrical energy spent. </p><br><h4 id="kofevarka-kapelnogo-tipa">  Drip Coffee Maker </h4><br><p>  Siemens TC 40207 900 W <br>  For the preparation of two cups of coffee-class drink (the volume as two double espresso from a coffee machine is higher) with a power of 470-500 W and cos œÜ = 100, 0.19 rubles and 55.67 Wh of electricity were spent.  Almost the same as the coffee machine. </p><br><h4 id="toster">  Toaster </h4><br><p> Drinking coffee is good when eating crispy hot toast.  We charge two slices of bread and cook until barely golden hue.  And so, the toasts jumped out, and the energy meter showed a power of 720 W, cos œÜ = 100, 23.44 WH.  And 8 kopecks were written off from my account. <del>  Sarcasm: it was necessary to do at night, it would have been 2 times cheaper. </del></p><br><h4 id="elektricheskiy-chaynik">  Electric kettle </h4><br><p>  <em>In childhood, our family had a kettle for a gas stove.</em>  <em>And to all my requests my parents said that an electric kettle consumes a lot of energy and to nothing.</em>  <em>But that day came: I have an engineering marvel in my hands, boiling water with electric current and energy meter to measure all this.</em> </p><br><p>  Under the hands got Tefal BF56 2000-2400 watts. <br>  In reality, judging by the testimony of Energomer, it works with a power of about 1750-1840 W and cos œÜ = 100.  Boiling 1.7 liters of water took 0.58 rubles.  Moving back (see the item <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/dadget/blog/283650/">‚ÄúHow to measure more accurately‚Äù</a> ) we get 170 WH‚ãÖ.  That is, about 100 Wh for every 1 liter of water. </p><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Calculation of heat capacity for fans :)</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><p>  Specific heat capacity of water at 20 ¬∞ , 4.182 kJ / kg ¬∞  <br>  Specific heat capacity of water at 100 ¬∞ , 4.216 kJ / kg ¬∞  <br>  We take about 4.2 kJ / kg ¬∞ C <br>  The amount of heat for heating 1 kg of water from 20 ¬∞  to 100 ¬∞  = 1 <em>4.2</em> (100-20) = 336 kJ <br>  1 kWh = 3600 kJ, 1 kJ = 1/3600 kWh <br>  We have: 336 * 1/3600 = 0.093 kW = h = 93.3 Wh <br>  We got 100 WH, which means 6.7 WH took heat losses. </p></div></div><br><h4 id="mikrovolnovaya-pech">  Microwave </h4><br><p>  Prototype LG MS2548DRKS.  The tag says "Max. 1250 W 2450 MHz 850 W". <br>  When turned on, the mode is 850 W - in fact, the microwave operated with a power of 1480 W and cos œÜ = 0.96. </p><br><p>  Curiously, but if you turn on the cooking power of 340 W, you can hear clicks on and off the magnetron.  The required cooking power is obtained by intermittent work schedule at full power.  At the energy meter, I saw a periodic power of 1480 W, which was replaced by 36 W (apparently so much is needed to rotate the dish, the cooler and all the electronics, without a magnetron). <br>  The microwave in the mode of displaying the current time operates with a power of 0.6 watts.  With an average daily cost of electricity of 4 rubles per 1 kWh it costs 21 rubles per year :) </p><br><h4 id="televizor">  Television </h4><br><p>  Let's look at the power consumption of the 2011 LG-32LD425 TV.  Good old, still "thick" LCD TV with FullHD, not LED <em>(in one of their meanings)</em> . </p><br><p>  It has power modes by adjusting the brightness of the backlight.  At 100% brightness, the power is 102 W, 73% is 95 W, 50% is 70 W, and 25% is 40 W.  In standby mode 0.4 watts. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/69d/bba/513/69dbba513f85455986386f76c850a071.jpg"><br><p>  <em>Power Saving Modes</em> </p><br><h4 id="sistemnyy-blok">  System unit </h4><br><p>  For personal use I use a system unit that works as a remote server.
