  <section class="page js-page"><h1>ZTE Blade: how we have gone the way to sane Android 4.1.2</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Amazing devices sometimes produce different companies.  In the near 2010, the company ZTE released a new smartphone called Blade.  The device belonged (and, by the way, belongs) to the budget segment, and, therefore, does not shine with characteristics.  You can find the characteristics on the same <a href="">Yandex.Market</a> . <br>  The smartphone was produced in two forms - European and Chinese.  Chinese equipped with 256 MB.  RAM, and European - 512 MB. <br>  For 2010, it was a great budget smartphone, equally good in price and quality (except for the 1250 mAh battery), it worked out of the box at 2.1. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Time flies, android is updated, updated and the device.  2.2, 2.3, 2.3.5 - were not long in coming.  The device received the official CyanogenMod version 7. But here comes a new round of the evolution of Android - version 4.0, and our device is out of business.  Qualcomm, which produces coding / decoding codecs for different processor architectures, announced that it will not release new codecs for devices with ARMv6 CPUs, but because  the fourth android used exactly new versions, and it couldn‚Äôt go on updating it.  Sadness ... <br><br>  But suddenly a <a href="http://www.modaco.com/topic/349952-rom-cyanogenmod-9-android-403/">topic</a> appears on the MoDaCo website, in which the author puts up links to the assembled CM9 for Blade.  This is where this thorny path begins.

      I will not touch on very early builds, for I bought myself this phone in March 2012. From here I will start.  On June 15, on the same Modaco, the topic appears for the authorship of the user KonstaT (even then he was known on the forum for his own builds of the ZTE stock firmware), in which he spreads his CM9 builds.  A long and stubborn correction of broken opportunities begins (some of our compatriots also had their hands on it).  Gradually, the build begins to grow into features, edits, and increasingly begins to look like a normal CM9.  Those Qualcomm codecs were replaced by third-party ones: there was no hardware video encoding / decoding, but the system worked. <br><br>  In parallel with this, on July 17, KonstaT creates a <a href="http://www.modaco.com/topic/355903-devrom81-cyanogenmod-10-android-412/">new theme</a> in which he begins to post CM10 builds.  And the problems are the same - there is no hardware c / d, the interface is stalled.  And the funny thing is that if you could close your eyes on European devices, the Chinese just lay down - the lags and brakes were creepy.  Plus, the so-called ‚ÄúProject Butter‚Äù did not work, accelerating the interface. <br><br>  And here, on October 24, <a href="http://4pda.ru/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D297387%26st%3D5460">on the forum w3bsit3-dns.com,</a> our compatriot under the nickname Ganster41 lays out his assembly, in which he repaired the hardware c / d.  Perhaps we can say that this is where a new round in the development of builds for ZTE Blade begins.  On the same day, KonstaT updates CM10, and after 7 days a new build CM9 appears (unfortunately, the last).  Well, in parallel with this, work is underway to accelerate and improve the system, and even on the ‚ÄúChinese‚Äù new builds begin to work tolerably. <br><br>  January 1 (: D) KonstaT releases its build CM10.1, which he very much surprised and pleased the community of ZTE Blade owners.  And on the 8th he releases the extreme build of CM10 and focuses his attention on 10.1.  By the way, at that time 10.1 worked more quickly on the Chinese than 10. But that‚Äôs not the point.  On January 20, daemond user announces the continuation of work on CM10 and releases his build.  It is worth mentioning that in parallel with the development of "clean" assemblies, various developers have ported and others: <a href="http://www.modaco.com/topic/357342-romjb-paranoidandroid-265-cm10-412-updated-2712013/">Paranoid</a> , <a href="http://www.modaco.com/topic/356928-4-nov-2013-jellybean-aokpcm10-remix-rc-24/">AOKP</a> , <a href="http://4pda.ru/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D297387%26st%3D3600">MIUI</a> .  And now we will smoothly switch to January 27, the assembly Paranoid.  The author lays out a new build in which we see the cherished lines: <br><blockquote>  <b>Enabled hardware vsync</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Project Butter complete</b> <b><br></b>  <b>(Credit to Daemond)</b> </blockquote><br>  This is a breakthrough!  After downloading this assembly, I was simply stupefied: the acceleration of the interface really took place.  Yes, what - at a glance three times.  D: <br><br>  Actually, I was inspired by the respect for such people as <b>KonstaT, Ganster41, Daemond, narkoman88, sanek1804</b> , who really could discover the potential of the device and do what ZTE and Qualcomm couldn‚Äôt do (they wrote a petition, even two) . <br><br>  On this, dear habrovchane, everything.  I beg you to answer the question - whether you need to attach screenshots from your phone or not (they are just in themes with firmware).  Thank you very much for your attention, I will be glad to any constructive criticism. <br><br>  <b>PS</b> I completely forgot to mention the young tital, who first began porting the branch at number 4 for this device. <br>  <b>PPS</b> Introduced himself and others astray - Project Butter appeared in 4.1.2, therefore moved it a little lower, by July 17 :) <br>  <b>PPPS</b> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/167535/">Here is my comment</a> with a brief description of different builds of android. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/167535/">https://habr.com/ru/post/167535/</a></p>
