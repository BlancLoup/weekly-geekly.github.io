Many companies that have their own data centers are faced with a situation of inefficient use of capacity, irrational utilization of capacity, lack of computing resources or storage units when loading the entire data center by no more than 20%.

      Another actual problem is often faced by government organizations and companies with distributed infrastructure.  They, as a rule, exploit a heterogeneous park of servers and incur high costs for managing, operating and upgrading equipment.  Also, do not forget about the high risks of downtime and breakdowns caused by the lack of connectivity within such a heterogeneous infrastructure. <br><br><h2>  What to build private clouds on? </h2><br>  We chose the Hyper-V Cloud as a platform for creating private clouds, but the choice was made in its favor for several reasons. <br><br>  First of all, the cost, Hyper-V has a strong and functional competitor in the face of VMware, but here the cost of licenses and, most importantly, management tools cools the fervor of any small company. <br><br>  Secondly, Microsoft products have a prevailing position in the internal corporate segment, and, accordingly, many clients already have licenses for many basic server products and management tools. <br><br>  Thirdly, we can offer, together with a private cloud, Parking Cube management and automation tools that allow you to control the operation of all system components and respond flexibly to changes in the cloud. <br><br><h2>  How are private clouds used? </h2><br>  Each use of cloud technology implies a specific scenario, among the most common we noted the following: <br><br>  <b>Infrastructure cloud (IaaS) to increase data center utilization</b> <br><br><img src="http://www.parking.ru/Attachment.aspx?Id=618" alt="image"><br>  This cloud allows you to optimize your IT infrastructure, simplify the maintenance process and reduce IT staff costs.  All resources are allocated only for internal needs. <br>  Consumers are provided with resources in the form of IaaS infrastructure, and if there is a software development unit, PaaS. <br><br>  <b>Private cloud for one industry group (community cloud)</b> <br><br><img src="http://www.parking.ru/Attachment.aspx?Id=619" alt="image"><br>  A typical example of building a ‚Äúcloud‚Äù of this type is when a private cloud is created in the main computing center at the ministry, from which subordinate structures receive both IaaS infrastructure services and SaaS software industry-specific and included in workflows.  At the same time, among the consumers there may be both subordinate structures and external organizations related to the Ministry of Commodity-Money Relations. <br><br>  The main services consumed under this task are often: accounting, personnel and management accounting, warehouse accounting, document management services, specialized industry programs, centralized data storage (DaaS). <br><br>  <b>Platform for public information resources and public services</b> <br><br><img src="http://www.parking.ru/Attachment.aspx?Id=620" alt="image"><br>  The customers are government organizations of various sizes from a municipality to a federal ministry, often lacking the necessary level of training for IT staff, not having their own data center, but needing automation services for typical business processes (BPaaS) to handle external and internal requests. <br><br>  One of the possible scenarios for using the platform is to provide services according to the Business Productivity as a Service scheme.  In this case, the organization receives the service in the remote data center, where the information system is located that performs one of the functions of the organization - for example, working with citizens. <br><br>  The main services consumed will be specialized systems designed to automate and unify typical processes both within the state organization and to simplify interaction with the public and other departments.  Also, government organizations can consume specialized SaaS services and bring applications to external data centers according to the application as a service (AaaS) scheme. <br><br>  <b>For more information on private cloud building scenarios and detailed information, see <a href="http://parking.ru/private/private_cloud/">http://parking.ru/private/private_cloud/</a></b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/118610/">https://habr.com/ru/post/118610/</a></p>
