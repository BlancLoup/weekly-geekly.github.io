  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Lexand LT-227: Android budget reader</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The Android operating system has long been used not only in smartphones and tablets, but also in portable players, cameras or e-books.  Moreover, if there are not so many cameras and players on the market, then there are more than enough ‚Äúreaders‚Äù on Android.  Moreover, among them will be not only expensive, but also low-end models.  The seven-inch Lexand LT-227 belongs to this segment. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b76/e55/1db/b76e551db58fd04f06e8b2521ed15641.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Specifications: <br>  ‚Ä¢ Type: e-book <br>  ‚Ä¢ Screen: resistive, 7 ", 480x800 pixels <br>  ‚Ä¢ Hardware platform: RockChip RK2818,700 MHz <br>  ‚Ä¢ RAM: 256 MB <br>  ‚Ä¢ Internal memory: 4 GB + microSD card support up to 32 GB <br>  ‚Ä¢ Communications: Wi-Fi b / g / n, miniUSB <br>  ‚Ä¢ Software platform: Android 2.2 <br>  ‚Ä¢ Additionally: a large number of pre-installed applications, support for Google Play, G-Sensor <br>  ‚Ä¢ Battery: Li-Pol, 2500 mAh <br>  ‚Ä¢ Body materials: soft-touch plastic <br>  ‚Ä¢ Dimensions: 180x125x9.5 mm <br>  ‚Ä¢ Weight: 300 grams <br><br><h4>  Appearance </h4><br>  Externally, the model Lexand LT-227 is almost indistinguishable from many other e-books.  It is enclosed in a rectangular casing of rubberized plastic with slightly rounded corners.  However, the manufacturer beat the back a bit, on which he applied relief arched grooves and a drawing in the form of a stack of books. <br>  Despite the positioning in the budget segment of the market, the build quality of the Lexand LT-227 is at a very high level.  The body of the book, I repeat, is made of rubberized plastic, not brand and non-slip material.  The size of the book is 180 x 125 x 9.5 mm, and the weight is 300 grams. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/00c/16d/fb8/00c16dfb87f41e2dfe2465af19dc764f.jpg">

      <br>
      Almost the entire front side of the e-book is occupied by a 7-inch screen, under which there are controls ("settings", "cancel", "forward" and "back"), which are slightly recessed into the case.  The manufacturer placed the block of buttons closer to the lower left corner so that the paging buttons were exactly in the center of the book.  Thus, the "reader" is quite convenient to use for both right-handers and left-handers, but on the condition that they have long fingers.  In other words, miniature girls, as well as children can hardly reach the paging buttons with the thumbs of both hands.  I also note that all the buttons have a soft press and a small move. <br>  On the right side you can find the power button, and on the bottom - a reset button, a charger jack, a 3.5 mm audio output, a microSD card slot, a miniUSB connector and a microphone. <br>  The speaker is located on the left rear of the Lexand LT-227. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/440/738/33e/44073833e2b3d1a688a4814547018e73.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Screen </h4><br>  In the LT-227, the manufacturer used a touchscreen TFT screen with a diagonal of 7 "and a resolution of 800 x 480 pixels. The display is resistive. As a result, the screen has a weak sensitivity: it only responds when pressed hard with fingers, so for navigation, text input etc. it is best to use a stylus (not included in the package). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e4b/da4/4a3/e4bda44a34de25d922b17da7a38e15ae.jpg"><br><br>  Viewing angles are also not the strength of the LT-227 screen.  When you deviate horizontally or vertically, you can see the inversion of colors, a decrease in contrast and brightness. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f47/014/ac6/f47014ac66d40697b2206f6ee74ae22e.jpg"><br><br>  However, the display is not as bad as it may seem.  Yes, he does not have enough stars from the sky, but I will not say that he is inferior to the displays that are used in budget "readers" and tablets of many manufacturers.  In addition, in the case of the LT-227, the sensitive layer is covered with a transparent matte plastic, so in bright light it practically does not glare - an important advantage. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6b1/b79/79e/6b1b7979e3738ed5b81dbe9fcc69471a.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Performance </h4><br>  The Lexand LT-227 model is based on the RockChip RK2818 chipset.  This Chinese miracle of the semiconductor industry contains a processor with a frequency of 700 MHz and an integrated graphics core Android PixelFlinger 1.3 with support for OpenGL ES-CM 1.0.  A couple of RockChip RK2818 is 256 MB of memory standard DDR2. <br>  With such a filling, Lexand LT-227 is poorly suited for games and other resource-intensive entertainment.  However, for 3 thousand rubles.  One could hardly expect impressive performance indicators. <br>  The e-book Lexand LT-227 is equipped with 4 GB of internal memory.  Copy speed is quite acceptable and is 3.2-3.5 Mb / s. <br><br><h4>  Software platform </h4><br>  The Reader is running the Android 2.2.1 operating system.  As a result, the user is able to install applications from Google Play, including programs for reading books in various formats. <br>  At the very top of the Lexand LT-227 screen is a status bar - a panel that displays time, Wi-Fi status, virtual buttons Home, Menu, Back and Volume Up / Down, as well as notifications about events, such as new letters. <br>  I note that in LT-227 implemented only one desktop.  It contains elements such as a clock, a weather widget, a search field, a bookshelf (tabs for ‚Äúlist of books‚Äù / ‚Äúhistory‚Äù), and a panel with a scrolling list of shortcuts for quick launch of applications. <br>  To bring up the application menu, you need to pull the small triangle located at the bottom of the screen. <br>  In all other respects, the user interface is exactly the same as other Android devices. <br><br><h4>  Exploitation </h4><br>  Since Lexand‚Äôs LT-227 e-book uses Android, the user can independently download the same applications that he uses on his smartphone.  However, personally, I do not see the point, since a large set of software from both Google and third-party developers has already been installed in memory of the "reader". <br>  Since the LT-227 model has a Wi-Fi module, a number of applications for working on the Web are already installed on it.  In particular, it is an Internet browser, Mail.Ru Agent, Odnoklassniki and several applications for working with Yandex services (Trains, Weather, Mail, Metro). <br><br>  As a program for reading books in the LT-227, the ‚ÄúBookshelf‚Äù application is used, which, in my opinion, does its job quite well and also supports most of the popular ‚Äúbook‚Äù formats (PDF, EPUB, FB2, TXT, MOBI). , HTML, PDB, RTF and LRC).  Unfortunately, this program does not support DjVu or Doc / Docx, but this problem is solved with the help of third-party programs available on Google Play. <br><br>  In addition to the readability, the LT-227 also offers audio playback (AAC, WMA, WAV, OGG, FLAC, APE, MP3) and video (MPG, RMVB, FLC, ASF, WMV, MP4, 3GP, RM, AVI, DATA and H .264).  The sound file player has pretty good functionality, and the video player, on the contrary, can hardly do anything.  Again, the problem is solved easily: nothing prevents to replace it with MX Player or any other program at the discretion of the user. <br>  The built-in speaker is quite quiet, so you can only listen to music or watch movies with headphones.  In the delivery set there are quite powerful in-ear headphones. <br><br>  During the testing device serious problems have arisen.  Nevertheless, there are still flaws in the work of LT-227.  In particular, the standard program for reading books occasionally crashes when opening files, which, in general, is not critical in conditions where it can be replaced with any other "reader".  Much more upset by the other - the strange behavior of the mechanical paging buttons, which sometimes do not work the first time in a preinstalled program for reading.  This problem is also treated by installing, for example, Nomad Reader from Google Play, where everything works "with a bang." <br>  In addition to reading, with Lexand LT-227 video is available.  The reader readily decodes the video as 720p and reproduces without any difficulty with speed. <br><br><h4>  Battery life </h4><br>  The e-book is equipped with a non-removable lithium-polymer battery 2500 mAh.  The manufacturer does not disclose battery life, but, according to my observations, we can talk about 3-7 hours of work without recharging. <br>  The "reader" lasted in the mode of reading books with minimum brightness and with the Wi-Fi module turned off for less than 7 hours, or more precisely, a little more than 6.5 hours.  Such working conditions, of course, are overly benign, therefore, in conditions close to combat, the battery life has decreased to 4-5 hours. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  Despite the fact that the Lexand LT-227 model has a touch screen, a Wi-Fi module, and a full-fledged operating system, it is by no means a tablet computer.  Because of its modest characteristics (resistive screen, slow platform), this device is better considered a good and affordable e-book with advanced features. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">interface screenshots</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/81c/c3f/013/81cc3f013960d95ca7f9b36e50cb4f07.png" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f55/6cc/307/f556cc307aa68e2c7d60d1ad5abf340f.png" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f83/d32/398/f83d323983750fa65cf74f66d053f976.png" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b84/93f/6a9/b8493f6a91f82fad8e9a751811f98463.png" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/468/27e/592/46827e5924a5f9f45d3bc5dd956c148b.png" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/57f/333/c07/57f333c07511500a07a0bc3d1986f0d3.png" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5bf/17d/814/5bf17d814de00c715ba09b477d7b4189.png" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8be/011/0ec/8be0110ec5826a3351fc72a17df5a7cb.png" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/919/b59/25c/919b5925c6589720c688f5e5bb787eb3.png" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5d8/37b/026/5d837b02668c0d2f00cc2ec55f00f564.png" alt="image"></div></div><br><br><h4>  Advantages: </h4><br>  ‚Ä¢ High-quality assembly <br>  ‚Ä¢ Low weight <br>  ‚Ä¢ Android operating system <br>  ‚Ä¢ Matte screen surface <br>  ‚Ä¢ Wi-Fi and Google Play directory <br>  ‚Ä¢ Play HD video <br>  ‚Ä¢ Affordable price <br><br><h4>  Disadvantages: </h4><br>  ‚Ä¢ Poor screen quality <br>  ‚Ä¢ Weak hardware platform <br>  ‚Ä¢ No memory card in the package </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/159319/">https://habr.com/ru/post/159319/</a></p>
