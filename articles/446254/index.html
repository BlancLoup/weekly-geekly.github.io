  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to quickly pump your wireless network</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Wireless data transmission technologies have firmly taken their place in our life.  Every day, often without realizing it, we enjoy the benefits of this achievement of civilization at home, in the office, on the way home or relaxing on the beaches of sunny, warm countries.  Our voice, our images, all the pieces of the digital world that are so dear to us almost always fly through a wireless channel at a certain stage of their journey, be it a backbone radio relay data line, a provider‚Äôs point-to-multipoint or banal and a bit ridiculous in their naivety Wi-Fi. <br><br>  But how often do we think about how the silent heroes of the Internet allow us to look at cats and female (or male) legs, without being inconvenienced and enjoying the process? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/433/fe5/0ed/433fe50ed868b0c46851ebdeff55d93d.png" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Every day, hundreds of thousands of installers, network administrators, network architects, AKS engineers, and other qualified professionals fight in invisible and intangible electromagnetic fields, so that every single wireless channel transmits data in the way the Shannon-Hartley theorem bequeathed to us.  Many sleepless nights and many cold days were spent on planning, building, configuring and supporting wireless data channels.  The time has come for the user to ease the work of those who have worked before day and night on adjusting the span!

    <h4>  We offer an innovative product that allows you to easily, quickly and easily improve the quality of any wireless channel. </h4><br>  As is known to everyone familiar with the topic of data transmission over the air without wires, the main metric of high-quality radio performance is RSSI, an indicator that reflects the power of a received signal by a device.  In essence, all the work of wireless network designers is to provide all the client devices with a sufficient level of RSSI.  Until today, it was possible to do it only at the design stage of a wireless network, and if during further installation or operation something went wrong (there was a physical obstacle, the client moved too far away from the reception area), then the data transfer became worse, and then and completely disappeared.  Installers at the facilities spent hours adjusting the problematic spans, Wi-Fi network customers complained about ‚Äúspinning circles‚Äù and ‚Äúlittle sticks‚Äù, cellular communication broke and stuttered, and the music in wireless headphones grunted and disappeared. <br><br><h4>  Now all this is in the past. </h4><br>  We offer the first of its kind software cloud blockchain product aimed at improving the quality of any wireless signal - dBaaS! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a32/53e/2c4/a3253e2c4ff2e2af963c8114b16fbf2e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  dBaaS is a unique product that allows you to effortlessly improve the signal from any source in any range! <br><br>  Just install dBaaS on any computer, smartphone, server and get RSSI improvement on any wireless link for as many decibels as you need! <br><br><h4>  Now you do not need to overpay for new antennas! </h4><br>  dBaaS will allow communication over a longer distance using the same antennas.  The most important thing is that it works in any frequency range, it‚Äôs not at all important how many gigahertz you have a channel - 2.4 GHz, like Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, 11 or 15, like a serious heavy wireless radio relay station, or even at 60, 70 GHz and higher - RSSI is measured equally for all these bands - in decibels, so it can be improved on any part of the network!  Not enough space on the phone, and you do not want to take up memory?  Then purchase the dBaaS cloud license, connect it to the selected link (the connection instructions are always attached to the purchased tariff plan) and get better access to the Internet simply from using the Internet! <br><br><h4>  Are you a provider and you need centralized management? </h4><br>  For you, there is a solution - a dBaaS server for installation in any virtualization infrastructure.  Any hypervisors that are widespread today are supported, and our flexible support programs will allow you to quickly implement the dBaaS solution on your network and benefit from it today, and in the future save substantial funds on network upgrades. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f41/6a9/850/f416a9850f7d586400db327d35b7a361.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Solution Catalog </h3><br><h4>  Custom versions </h4><br><ul><li>  <b>dBaaS Solo</b> - license for one device (ARM).  Increases by 5 dB RSSI for Wi-Fi or Bluetooth (one of the protocols) </li><li>  <b>dBaaS Solo Pro</b> - license for one device (x86 / x64).  Designed for installation on a PC.  Increases RSSI by 5 dB for Wi-Fi. <br>  <b><i>Attention!</i></b>  If you use an Intel wireless adapter of any version of 802.11, then you get +2 dB boost for free! </li><li>  <b>dBaaS Solo Pack</b> - includes dBaaS Solo and dBaaS Solo Pro.  Kit for one workplace employee.  Profitable proposition! <br>  <b><i>Attention!</i></b>  If you are purchasing a dBaaS Solo Pack for use in the company for staff, please ask our sales department for a discount on the package offer for you! </li><li>  <b>dBaaS Solo Family</b> - three dBaaS Solo licenses and one dBaaS Solo Pro license for the whole family!  +5 dB to RSSI for everyone! <br>  <b><i>Attention!</i></b>  For large families, please contact our sales department for special versions of dBaaS Solo Multisibling with an increased number of children's licenses!  There are social packages with RSSI improvement up to +10 dB! </li></ul><br><h4>  Cloud version </h4><br>  dBaaS Cloud - a cloud version of the product for execution in our virtual environment.  You gain complete convenience and freedom from installing the application - along with a unique wireless experience! <br><br>  The cloud version is represented by two products: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>dBaaS Cloud Personal</b> - SOHO-solution for end users and small (up to 20 work devices) companies.  Despite its ease of use, this is a full-fledged B2B solution, which, nevertheless, is easily customized by users without special education and / or experience in administering serious decisions.  Provides a collective increase in RSSI from 5 to 7 dB in inverse proportion to the total device load (with a high channel load, a short-term decrease in the improvement of the received signal is possible - this is due to the increasing complexity of calculating the next blocks). </li><li>  <b>dBaaS Cloud Enterprise</b> is a powerful solution for serious business.  The depth of licensing is up to 1000 devices / channels (in any combination), the total improvement in RSSI is up to 10 thousand dB per administrator account.  Cross-platform solution (works with channels on any devices that support wireless data transmission and have an ip-address), which allows you to ‚Äúpump‚Äù in a short time without additional investments in infrastructure of a wireless network of any range / protocol / complexity of topology. </li></ul><br>  Please be careful - very careful configuration of the firewall is required!  The use of this version implies that the Customer / Customer‚Äôs engineer has a qualification not lower than the corresponding CWAP certification and analogues! <br><br><h4>  Version to install in the hypervisor </h4><br>  The most productive solutions of dBaaS B2B / B2G segment and carrier level.  At the time of publication of the article on the market, there is definitely no equivalent of either high performance or the number of functions supported by the solution.  The main advantages of the <b>dBaaS Uncut</b> system: <br><br><ul><li>  Support up to 5 thousand channels / up to 57 thousand dB per virtual dBaaS instance; </li><li>  Active / Active clustering up to 5 instances of dBaaS Uncut - full redundancy of RSSI increase for the entire service domain, as well as load balancing between cluster nodes and total performance up to 25 thousand channels / up to 280 thousand dB! </li><li>  Multi-tenancy - allocation of any (up to 100) number of administrator accounts with the corresponding delimitation of the capacity of each account (from 1 channel / 5 dB per account to the full capacity of the cluster); </li><li>  Full integration with Cosco ICE and full MDM support!  You can improve the wireless connections of selected groups of employee client devices according to the established rules! </li><li>  Support for improving the RSSI for the 802.11ax standard by changing the MU-MIMO streaming palette to eight-bit - no additional licenses required! </li><li>  Stream balancing of an unused SINR in the background - if any client device consumes less traffic than the signal-to-noise ratio for this client allows, unused decibels are transferred between the most highly loaded clients using the weightened round-robin algorithm. </li></ul><br>  Since the dBaaS system in the Enterprise version is a complex and very flexible software product, we are pleased to offer our partners a two-week course at the base of our Training Center - please regularly check the schedule of our <a href="https://comptek.ru/learning/">Training Center</a> so as not to miss the announcement! <br><br>  In order to purchase a product and / or receive additional information about its capabilities and applicability to your network, you can always write a letter to <a href="">our sales department</a> , after having previously specified the date of placement of this announcement in the subject line. <br><br>  Enjoy your wireless work! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/446254/">https://habr.com/ru/post/446254/</a></p>
