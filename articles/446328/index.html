  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why do we need SMS reception services and what do they eat?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Services that provide a temporary number for receiving SMS online, appeared after many social networks, trading platforms and other Internet resources switched from user identification, during registration, via e-mail to identification via the sent code to the phone number, and often the code to phone number and email confirmation. <br><br><h2>  For whom there are services that provide virtual numbers online? </h2><br>  The entire audience of users of resources that provide services for receiving SMS to phone numbers online can be divided into groups: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The first group is the most numerous and generating the most income for SMS activation services - these are people using various programs for cheating (likes, subscribers, votes, etc.).  To carry out their activities, these people need thousands of bots, to create which, respectively, they need thousands of phone numbers.  For ourselves, we will call such customers sms activators "wholesalers". <br><br><h4>  We continue to separate users SMS activators </h4><br>  The second group, let's call it "cunning", is made up of amateurs to use vulnerabilities.  I will give an example: a few years ago, they were especially clever, who understood the sequence of numbers of cards of the Perekrestok grocery chain and, through enumeration of cards, identifying what bonus points there were, tied up to five cards to a new account (using numbers from SMS activation services) and Consequently, they could easily pay for groceries with groceries in stores.  Something similar exists in our days, only now with the Pyaterochka network, because it is from the Crossroads in the same retail network of the x5 retail group and decided to use the same system for bonuses. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      Also in this group are those who follow discounts and bonuses upon first purchase.  Again, consider an example: there was a special offer in a well-known KFC fast-food chain; when registering with their application or personal account on the website that you pull up to the application in your phone, you are given a 30% discount on the purchase of a bucket with wings.  And with each new campaign for the wings, while the action was in effect, the representatives of our ‚Äúcunning‚Äù group registered a new account using a temporary number for receiving SMS from one of the SMS activation services, paying for it no more than 5 rubles, and receiving a benefit of 30% from order at KFC. <br><br><h4>  The last group of users SMS activators </h4><br>  The third group is the smallest.  These are those whom we call "private traders."  Who buys temporary numbers for receiving SMS up to 10pcs.  And again, I‚Äôll give you an example: you sell cars and place ads on the avito marketplace.  The first ad for you will be free, the second for a nominal fee, the more and more you will post ads for the sale of cars, the higher the avito price tag will be for you, up to 1000r for a new ad.  Also on Avito operates a similar system of price increases for placing ads for the sale of spare parts and other things.  Or you are a homegrown housewife and want to check out your husband by registering a page in Intagram or vkontakte and writing to him from this new page, where there is a photo of a female of attractive appearance. <br><br><h2>  Pros and cons of the most popular SMS activation services </h2><br>  And now let's consider the largest and most popular services that provide temporary telephone number rental services for receiving SMS online: <br><br>  1) <a href="https://sms-activate.ru/">sms-activate.ru</a> Service more than three years.  If you believe their statistics on the site, then they register from 200 to 400 people per day and acquire at least one number from 3000 to 5000 users.  Prices for this resource are average.  There are also above, and below, a detailed table with prices for the resources in question will be attached after the review.  From the negative, with them with less than 6% of successful use of numbers, you get a ban and you will learn this only by getting a ban and contacting those.  support  That is, if you try to register an account on VKontakte, and an account has already been registered for the number provided to you, you can refuse it, but if you do it about 20 times in a row, you will get a ban.  And for how long it is completely unclear, they have their own kind of algorithm, the blocking conditions are not registered anywhere on the site. <br><br>  2) <a href="http://simsms.org/">simsms.org</a> Externally and prices are very similar to the resource discussed above, from the negative they also have something like bans, but they are called the loyalty system or the so-called ‚Äúkarma‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hc/-x/94/hc-x94mf3dfbs5psuyowrryid_0.jpeg"><br><br>  And the main disadvantage of this service, unlike all the others described in this article, simsms.org give a number for 20 minutes, for which you will receive only one SMS from the service you have chosen.  All the rest of the services in our article providing a number for 20 minutes. Allow you to receive an unlimited number of SMS from your chosen resource.  This is very useful when registering, for example, in order to have a Yandex wallet, you must first register Yandex mail (receive 1 sms with a code) and only then register the wallet itself (another 1 sms), and you will pay for 1 resource. <br><br>  3) <a href="https://cheapsms.ru/">cheapsms.ru</a> relatively young resource, perhaps with the lowest prices.  Unfortunately, they are often attacked and the site is unavailable.  And lately, there are no rooms available for the most popular services and ‚Äúother‚Äù. <br><br>  4) <a href="http://sms-reg.com/">sms-reg.com is</a> one of the oldest SMS activation services, but has deteriorated over the years.  They do not develop at all, the site has been virtually unchanged since 2015. A very uncomfortable personal account.  Do not display how much of what service is now available.  And also a very high price tag (you can see in the table after the description of services). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qw/xz/2r/qwxz2rffvhxzafnd4xn_zzc4jcq.jpeg"><br><br>  5) <a href="http://onlinesim.ru/">onlinesim.ru</a> are ‚Äúwhite‚Äù services, they have Open LLC Online, where 6 people are on staff and even free resources you can find information on them, including the CEO.  Of course, this is good for them, but let's be honest - such services cannot be official a priori.  For the user, the most unpleasant surprise will be, identification through a passport photo with a piece of paper attached to it, which will be your id from their site and page with registration. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cw/p3/a2/cwp3a2vubiftv0xl_tvt92_8nqy.jpeg"><br><br>  Passage of identification on their website is mandatory when using Russian numbers, for the use of foreign numbers identification is not required.  What will they do with passport data?  can gain microloans? <br><br><h4>  Prices </h4><br>  As promised, below is a comparison of the prices of the considered services.  Actual on 01/31/2019. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/73/lp/xj/73lpxjjtuay4xcm2anrl2e12tyw.jpeg"><br><br><h2>  Summarizing </h2><br>  Your social network page can be blocked after a week or a month, and no SMS activation service will ever give you the number you took a week or even a day ago.  Accordingly, the social network page you lose.  Use the above described services is only with the knowledge that you can block a registered account at any time and you will lose access to it forever, so do not use accounts registered in this way on a permanent basis.  If you need a one-day account, then go ahead.  Most importantly, do not forget about the risk of losing an account, none of these services will help you to return it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/446328/">https://habr.com/ru/post/446328/</a></p>
