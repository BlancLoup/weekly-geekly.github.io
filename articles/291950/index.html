    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  Gyms will not surprise anyone.  They are many where there is, not only in IT.  It all depends on geographic accessibility.  We were lucky - the staff can train in the same building for an annual subscription for free. <br><br>  But we headed for team sports. <br><br>  Since in the field of information technology is more likely to meet the male half, hockey and tennis immediately found their audience.  Over time, training increased to two times a week.  Naturally, after the work day. <br><br>  They say that IT people are not the most athletic people.  Can.  But ours, together with the managers, find the sports spirit somewhere :) <br><br>  What else have we tried? <br><br>  Our choice focused on seasonal sports - yachting and snowboarding.  The intellectuals liked sailing very much.  Heat, wind, water - all this takes on new colors under sail.  It was difficult to organize this sport by itself, the yacht club came to the rescue - thanks to them.  The practical part is now taking place in Turkey, and such trips are very similar to the mini-vacation. <br><br>  Considerable demand and billiards.  Recently hosted friendly tournaments. <br><br>  But with football somehow did not work out.  The guys were engaged for about four months, but then it became less and less willing.  Small team, of course, you will not play football.  Therefore, we stopped classes.  Maybe we will come back to football later. <br>  And yet, the most joyful thing is that the employees devote their free time to the sport, train and play with pleasure.  Maybe before they simply lacked the opportunity or fun company? <br><br>  Any organization can create a culture of healthy lifestyle, at least for their team.  Or at least try. <br>  Recall Google - in addition to simulators, there are billiard tables, mini-golf and many other interesting things, depending on the specific office. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aa6/b3b/48e/aa6b3b48e4a74491820dadb00b3e070e.jpg"><br><br>  Mail.ru has tabletop football and basketball.  As well as a whole room that can become a field for playing football or even a full-fledged rink. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/043/bd7/376/043bd7376d074cdf95667bae448b5f33.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/291950/">https://habr.com/ru/post/291950/</a></p>
