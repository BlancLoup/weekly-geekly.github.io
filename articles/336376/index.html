  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Technical implementation of the new Yota product for smartphones</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  July 25, 2017, we introduced a <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/yota/blog/334326/">new product for smartphones.</a>  Its main difference from everything that previously existed on the market is the ability to independently choose only what the client needs.  Separately, a package of minutes, a separate package of traffic, a separate unlimited access to mobile applications of the most popular social networks and instant messengers. <br>  The basis of the new line was the DPI technology, which allowed us to offer our customers the simplest and most convenient product. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>How DPI helped us create a new line</b> <br><br>  DPI technology (or deep packet inspection) allows you to study traffic on the network.  Using a special analysis on the identity of characteristic features, it helps to collect and determine the types of packets passing through it: video, web, traffic from applications, instant messengers or YouTube - and allows you to identify traffic on each of these channels separately. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/b0a/3a7/807/b0a3a78075384d7fa5b6701d595b94ab.jpg">

      The DPI action algorithm is approximately as follows: the system analyzes the sequence of requests from the device and the responses of services, and then processes them.  Moreover, not only the analysis of formal traffic parameters is carried out, but also its identification according to criteria such as session frequency, packet size, source IP address and destination IP address.  But most importantly, the system allows you to correlate the presence of several sessions with a specific behavioral model. <br><br>  Based on the many characteristics of traffic statistics is collected, which allows you to identify applications, functions and content, the most popular audience. <br><br>  At the end of 2016, it became obvious to us that the majority of customers who needed a truly unlimited internet connection were already connected to us.  And 85% of new customers consume no more than 5 GB per month.  At the same time, up to 80% of traffic falls on the 10 most popular applications. <br><br>  In January 2017, we presented the first line in which a client could choose a package of minutes + a package of traffic and unlimited access to a package of social networks and instant messengers. <br>  This was our first experience using DPI when creating a ruler.  Since this technology allowed us to exclude Facebook, Facebook Messenger, VKontakte Odnoklassniki, Instagram, Twitter, WhatsApp, Viber, Skype, Telegram from billing. <br><br>  <b>Simple and understandable</b> <br><br>  For six months, we analyzed the activity of customers who have switched or connected to the new line and decided to give users more freedom of choice.  Now, customers can buy not only minutes and gigabytes, but also individually unlimited access to nine applications.  For example, you can connect only Facebook + Facebook Messenger or all nine applications. <br><br>  The new product is similar to the previous one built on DPI.  We determine whether traffic belongs to a particular application and do not charge it if the client has connected unlimited access to himself. <br><br>  Similar solutions for zeroing traffic for certain services existed on the Russian market before, for example, mobile operators declared Facebook and ‚ÄúVKontakte‚Äù as the default zone for all customers.  Such solutions were built on interaction with the sites themselves and zeroing traffic to and from a specific list of IP addresses. <br><br>  DPI, on the other hand, allows us to automate the process of determining traffic and completely eliminate the need for interaction with third-party services, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, it more accurately determines whether traffic belongs to a particular application because it uses several features besides IP. <br><br>  We will continue to analyze the popularity of various applications with our customers and make changes to the line so that it becomes even more user-friendly. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/292/3f0/ca0/2923f0ca0fb949a184cec486b65b5d02.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/336376/">https://habr.com/ru/post/336376/</a></p>
