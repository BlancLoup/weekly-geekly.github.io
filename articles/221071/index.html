      In fact, of course, they can and should be used for another. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Details </h4><br>  Let's look at this example here: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/237/58a/3ab/23758a3ab5c14bb544f8b916bcb43540.png" alt="image"><br><br>  This is a questionnaire after purchase, and in this version it is now used in our retail stores to receive a discount card. <br><br>  At the time of filling out this questionnaire, we already have a phone number and the name of the buyer in the database.  Now we need mail (for mailing) and birthday.  Also - a tick on the processing of PD.  All these blocks are clear and do not cause questions. <br><br>  Now look at the bottom block.  This retail needs store feedback.  If the assessment worsens somewhere - this is an indicator that you need to understand.  They also often write about wishes there and sometimes good ideas that we take to work slip through. <br><br><h4>  Why then the rest? </h4><br>  The rest of the questionnaire is at the same time collecting marketing data about a person as a representative of the audience and, attention, <b>training</b> .  All questions are formulated so that, answering them, the user learns about our capabilities. <br><br>  First, we tell that there is not only an online store.  Then - about the fact that any game can be opened.  At the same time, we remind you about what is worth telling friends about the store.  We explain why you can still come to the store - for example, not only for a toy to a child, but also for a gift to colleagues.  We learn new ways of consumption - on the road, to a party, moving for the summer and so on.  This, in particular, to avoid the impression that board games are only for children. <br><br>  Let's do it again: we just learned a lot of things about the person who answered the question (which will allow us to more accurately form the assortment policy and advertising), plus we taught him a lot of new things.  At the same time - at the same time we tested the knowledge (do we learn this well through other channels?). <br><br><h4>  Power of recall </h4><br>  One of the most magical things is that a subroutine is built into a person that is responsible for monitoring the integrity of decisions.  It, so to say, resembles the Win95 system libraries in terms of the extent to which they are buggy. <br><br>  Festinger in 1959 discovered a completely magical thing and described it in the work ‚ÄúCognitive consequences of forced compliance‚Äù.  Very briefly: all basic social norms lead to the fact that what a person claims and does is his position.  However, if you say something, and this is not your position, compensation is required.  This could be a justification for a threat, a suggested reward, or something else.  If there is no such excuse, and the behavior is the result of your choice, a slight cognitive dissonance occurs.  In the weak case, it is often not even recognized at the level of consciousness - and our integrity subroutine eliminates it, simply changing the <b>view</b> so that it corresponds to the previously stated one. <br><br>  So, this whole theory allows you to get to the tick "I would recommend."  Having set the assessment made by a conscious choice, we fix this behavior as a base one.  Our integrity subroutine strengthens it according to the scheme: ‚ÄúI made a choice - I expressed it - it means that it‚Äôs right - it means it needs to be written to the cache‚Äù.  Gain - decision after evaluation.  We have 97-98% of "fives", so the buyer still thinks about why he likes the store.  This is a very valuable moment. <br><br>  And now aerobatics.  Look at the questionnaires that are sometimes sent to you by banks, all kinds of courses, and so on - well, sort of like, just make sure that everything is in order.  Where else should be assessed on a scale from 1 to 5 level of service.  Or remember how you rate the level of service after a call to tech support.  And track the minor, but very deep changes in your mind after they are filled. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4b4/593/c06/4b4593c06cc76176cfc982b7cbfb27e4.png" alt="image">  PS I have been writing for three years about our business and everything connected with it.
