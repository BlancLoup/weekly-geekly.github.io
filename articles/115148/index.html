  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What are dangerous cheap GPS jammers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In January 2007, <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn20202-gps-chaos-how-a-30-box-can-jam-your-life.html%3Fpage%3D1">strange events</a> began to take place in San Diego: ATMs stopped working, cellular communications disappeared, the flight monitoring system at the airport was disrupted, and so on.  The chaos lasted for two hours until the reason became clear: there were two US Navy warships near the coast, which carried out training exercises in the event of a loss of communication.  For this, the active GPS jamming system was activated.  By mistake, satellite signals were muffled not only by ships, but also by civilians in the city. <br><br>  That case showed how important GPS is for the performance of various services.  It turns out that cell towers, electrical networks, information banking systems, and even the stock exchange all rely on accurate time signals from GPS satellites. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  According to some experts, our dependence on GPS is becoming too dangerous, given the extreme unreliability of this technology.  The problem is that the satellite signal is very weak, and it is extremely easy to drown out if you generate noise at the same frequency.  The signal can be drowned out by a primitive Chinese-made device, which is sold in online stores for $ 30.  Although the device is prohibited for use in most civilized countries, there is still a demand for it, which means there is a supply - in China such devices have already gone into mass production at local factories. <br><br>  Buyers are usually commercial vehicle drivers who want to avoid being tracked by the employer.  The device is used and auto theft to suppress the tracking system in a hijacked car.

      The range of the car jamming is very small.  But after all, hypothetical terrorists or fraudsters can use more powerful devices, similar to those used by the US Navy near San Diego.  It is terrible to imagine what chaos will arise in the modern metropolis if someone activates such a jammer of sufficient power.  Damage can be worse than any terrorist attack.  It is surprising that now various emergency services, including ambulance, emergency services, military, flight and rail management systems, power supply systems, all are moving towards using satellite coordinates and time signals without worrying about creating a <a href="http://www.gla-rrnav.org/radionavigation/eloran/index.html">backup system</a> . <br><br>  According to the GPS World magazine, more than a billion GPS receivers are currently in use in the world, and more than 90% of them are used only to receive accurate time signals. <br><br>  Interestingly, enthusiasts have already created working samples of a new generation of such devices that can not only jam, but <i>distort</i> GPS signals.  Fraudsters can use this to implement some large scams (for example, all applications on the stock exchange are marked with accurate time signals, so that sabotage in a competitor's network will allow you to manipulate stock quotes).  According to some estimates, with mass production the cost of such devices will range from $ 500 to $ 600. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/115148/">https://habr.com/ru/post/115148/</a></p>
