In ESET, as in any other large "computer" company has its own technical support service.  She takes an insane amount of calls and written customer calls during the month.  But only some of them deserve special attention ... <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  I must say that the service works with good performance - by the end of July we can report: <b>96% of</b> calls are received.  Only <b>360</b> calls remained unprocessed, that is, about <b>12</b> calls per day.  This is a very high figure.  Four support employees took <b>900</b> calls each, and one more, more than <b>1,100</b> .

      Putting all the records here is impossible for technical reasons, and not very appropriate.  Therefore, we simply give some of them, which we conditionally divided into two categories - <b>thanks</b> and <b>complaints</b> .  There is also a third one - a frank mate, but for reasons of political correctness and sanity, we will not spread it ... however, if anyone needs it, write, send it to the PM. <br>  Yes, I almost forgot, in all the messages spelling and punctuation is preserved in its original form. <br><br>  Let's start with ... <br><br>  <b>Thanks:</b> <br><br>  Message: Thanks to the team for the excellent anti-virus program.
