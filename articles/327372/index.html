I would like to acquaint you with a relatively small project that I made from scratch in about 150 hours (50 visits ~ 3 hours each) on the Unreal Engine 4. I did the project live on the air only once a week (a total of a year has passed) , incidentally answering questions from users. <br><br>  The project itself was not intended as commercial.  The goal I put in practice is to show the complexity of game development, namely such problems as: <br><br><ul><li>  Project planning and prototyping </li><li>  Thinking through and implementing the project architecture and its individual components </li><li>  User Interface Implementation </li><li>  Debugging and error correction </li><li>  Work with assets and graphics </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d6f/138/53e/d6f13853e6cad06fd0eaa0280603ac2d.jpg" alt="image">

      <br>
      At the end of the entire series of streams, we had a playable prototype of the ‚ÄúSurvival‚Äù shooter.  Those who have a glass half full can even call it a pre-alpha without a plot. <br><br>  If you are interested in the details of the project, recordings of streams, sources, etc., read on. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The entire project was implemented on a visual programming system called ‚ÄúBlueprints‚Äù.  And of course, many experts can call it childish, you can safely develop even a relatively large project on it.  Moreover, this can be done relatively quickly, as we have already been able to prove. <br><br>  Just want to answer the question: " <i>Why is Blueprint, and not C ++?</i> ".  Well, firstly, when I started the series, I hardly knew the pros.  Although I would now make a similar single on the BP.  Secondly, the BP is almost as good as the pluses in our case, but at the same time they provide a number of possibilities: They don‚Äôt allow making a lot of mistakes possible with pluses; there‚Äôs no need to be distracted between BP and C ++, which is more understandable for beginners.  And in our case, they are not much slower, given the fact that almost all logic is built on events. <br><br>  We also had a little time to work on the graphics.  Unfortunately, we did not have time to do assets, so we left some of them empty, some were made directly from primitives in the editor, and some content was borrowed from free demos of Epic Games.  Nevertheless, they managed to do something themselves, for example, the system of day and night, post-processing for water and some materials of the objects of the scene. <br><br>  In the plans of my streams, there were also problems that may arise during development.  I specifically decided them on the air, in order not only to show what young developers might encounter, but also how to debug their code, search for bugs and write their code so that the whole thing could be done twice as fast.  Of course, I haven't had any experience in programming for decades, and this affected the stupid mistakes I sometimes made.  And I am sure that many developers can challenge many points in the process of writing a game. <br><br>  Naturally, this can hardly be called a full-fledged game, since there is neither a plot nor a goal in the game - only pure mechanics.  Nevertheless, I believe that the result can be proud of and it fully reflects what the whole project was intended for. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">A list of all that we managed to implement in our game</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  <b>Character</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Character management </li><li>  The system of vital signs (Life, armor, stamina, hunger, thirst) </li><li>  Switch view (from first person to third) </li><li>  Modelka (made in Fuse, animation took with Mixamo) </li><li>  Customized animations for moving and using weapons </li><li>  Universal interaction with objects </li></ul><br><br>  <b>Inventory object system</b> <br><ul><li>  Inventory component (embed in any object where you want) </li><li>  Cell system with support for various sized items </li><li>  Inventory size per cell per page and by weight. </li><li>  A class of items that can be put in inventory.
