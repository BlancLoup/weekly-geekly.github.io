In the last article, ‚Äú <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/271460/">From Idea to Implementation. Part One - Failure,</a> ‚Äù I wrote a real-life example of how a project really began, and how it ended. <br><br>  In the same article, we will talk about the very first step, from which virtually everything begins.  I want to make a reservation in advance that you should not take my articles as a reference guide or guide to action.  I am writing purely analytical material.  Roughly speaking, thoughts are heard, in which I try to analyze the cause and effect.

      So, the birth of an idea.  Let me digress a little, and remember an interesting film with DiCaprio - "The Beginning".  Whoever looked, he remembers that it was the idea that was the key to victory.  It was she who struck the brain with an annoying desire to carry out some action.  And it is with her that everything begins. <br><br>  Here I would break the process of the emergence of the initial idea, for the implementation of a new project or startup, into several parts: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  1. It is the birth of the idea.  This is a very rare occurrence or gift.  More clearly, such a natural gift can be traced from talented poets, writers, composers, etc.  A man sits, dreams about this, about this, and overshadows him.  Boom, and the idea itself appears in his brain. <br><br>  2. Gradual awareness of the fact that you lack a certain tool, service or something, for comfortable work or pastime.  This is a more frequent phenomenon, which in the final may lead to an idea.  For example, a person works with different sites, looking for information, or just trying to have fun from the fuss of the world.  But an understanding comes that he cannot do it or make it qualitatively.  And then the idea is born.  Why not make a project that could satisfy the needs, at least some of the Internet users. <br><br>  3. Purposeful search for ideas.  This is a very frequent mechanism used by professional startups.  The world is huge, and not all of us are geniuses.  We may have our own team or finance, or the opportunity to have it all under a good idea.  The bottom line is to find a certain niche that can, if implemented, ‚Äúshoot‚Äù.  In fact, it should happen the same as in paragraph two, but a lot of effort is spent on searching, data processing and analysis.  And not the fact that what will be ultimately formed into an idea will be really correct. <br><br>  4. This is the oldest method, which is as old as the world itself - the theft of an idea.  There are two aspects here.  The first is the theft of a bare idea, which was born as a result of 1-3 points.  And the second is an attempt to ‚Äúbicker‚Äù another popular project, in the hope that it will also become popular.  And if at the first aspect chances are great, then at the second they are negligible. <br><br>  Now that we have been able to slightly classify the process of the birth of an idea, the nature of the future production process can be identified.  I will express my personal opinion here, so please do not kick me in the comments in the comments. <br><br>  Ideas born from the first and second categories are very emotionally strong for their creator.  They may itch in the head, making it difficult to eat and sleep, forcing something to do.  And for so many people, this will be a great incentive to start a new life.  This idea can both lift a person and destroy.  Everything here depends on the personal character, abilities and determination of each individual. <br><br>  As a rule, when work begins, it all rests on only one possessed person.  The idea gains more clarity, becomes clearer, overgrown with small details and details.  Here, very often, a person goes to the very end, regardless of anything.  Therefore, the bearer of such an idea, its engine, heart and soul, is precisely that indispensable person, with whose departure from the team, everything collapses.  And there are plenty of examples in history. <br><br>  As for the third category, I would compare it with a marriage of convenience.  Here, a team or an individual has a sober mind and a cold heart.  Such a person is not overcome by itching, the heart does not jump out of the chest.  He is simply looking for a nugget, grinding tons of rock.  Here I would single out a separate aspect of the fact that the idea will be evaluated only from the point of view of finances (you can forget about love and passion).  But human society is a kind of living substance, very changeable, very capricious and very irrational.  Therefore, the fact that the mathematical formula has invested in the framework of success may not work in practice. <br><br>  And the last, fourth category.  History knows quite a few examples of how good, but stolen ideas soared to the skies.  And just as failed attempts to follow.  Although there are successful projects that, with the same idea, could give the user a lot more than the original project.  But today, I think this is a very difficult task.  And the problem will not be to create and launch such a project, but to convince users that your site is more interesting for them. <br><br>  Based on what I said above, I want to make some generalized conclusion.  I believe that the idea is the most important, and the very first thing with which any startup starts.  And if in the CIS countries, many are chasing financing, then abroad, many investors are chasing after ideas.  It remains only for the bearer of a good idea to meet with the investor who is looking for it.  And then, I am convinced that everything will work out. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/391017/">https://habr.com/ru/post/391017/</a></p>
