      Inflation is growing, minimum wages are growing and only the wages of ordinary citizens for some reason are constantly falling.  As Zhvanetsky had there: ‚ÄúThere is light at the end of the tunnel, but <i>something</i> does not end with the tunnel‚Äù.  Or whatever he is.  It is not surprising that many smart and self-sufficient filed in freelancing.  Then who takes what: who develops websites, who <a href="https://2polyglot.com/ru/search/translator">translates texts</a> , and who <a href="https://2polyglot.com/ru/search/copywriter">knows how to write</a> .  And now, strong and independent in the US alone have gathered almost 54 million by 2016. <br><br><h4>  <b>Labor market</b> </h4><br><br>  Despite the active development of IT-technologies, in 2015, sales specialists remained the most popular.  According to <i><a href="http://www.liga.net/projects/jobtrends/">Liga.net</a></i> , in Ukraine, 23% of all offers from employers are occupied by vacancies for salespeople.  Apparently, the robot could not replace the person.  Not a single context, as they say.  The list of lucky ones was joined by marketers and simple hard workers who everyone wants, but they are not enough for everyone.  In other industries, there is relative harmony and only the young ones are of no interest to anyone.  Few people love the inexperienced. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cc7/348/e5a/cc7348e5afc3406cbc34026ce0a30841.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><br>  ‚ÄúThe economy should be economical‚Äù, so in 2014 more than 40% of financial enterprises made reductions.  <i>‚ÄúUkrzaliznitsya‚Äù</i> <a href="http://mail.vidgolos.com/127676-ukrzaliznicya-popri-zbitki-u-6-mlrd-kupila-dzhip.html">buys</a> 76 freight cars, a helicopter for several million dollars (2016) and a jeep for 300 thousand UAH.  (2011), declaring the company's loss of 6 billion UAH.  and raising the cost of train tickets.  <i>‚ÄúLvivska zal—ñznitsya‚Äù</i> buys 200 bins for the price of 5 thousand UAH.  a piece.  So, in 2014 the competition of applicants was about 3 people per place.  But the labor market does not stand still and by the beginning of 2015 already 5 people tried to win the game ‚ÄúKing of the Hill‚Äù.  Since May of the same year, someone has withdrawn from the race, and experts have announced the stabilization of the labor market.  But it seems that some of the competitors have gone to fight with digital swords for a place under the sun on <a href="http://htpps//2polyglot.com/ru">freelance exchanges</a> .  ‚ÄúThey didn‚Äôt showcore famously ...‚Äù. <br><br><h4>  <b>Freelance services market in Eastern Europe</b> </h4><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/43d/07d/f65/43d07df657434fb4a8d0cc0be72a3866.png" alt="image"></div><br><br>  According to <i>TopsDev</i> , by the beginning of 2016, in the whole of Eastern Europe, Ukrainian freelancers had the most, although the growth slowed down noticeably.  Apparently, as experts say, the market has stabilized.  ‚ÄúHa, nonsense,‚Äù they said, ‚ÄúGathering thieves and a gang of beggars,‚Äù they said.  But at the end of 2014, the Ukrainian freelance fraternity earned 61 million dollars, which is more than the same ‚Äústray‚Äù specialists from other CIS countries.  That is, still stray, but not at all poor.  And all together they export only IT services for $ 1.5 billion, according to <i><a href="http://ain.ua/">AIN</a></i> .  Office plankton, who loves to wash all the bones, took up the counting of money in the pockets of freelancers: $ 61 million divided into 19,100 completed tasks.  It turned out that for an average salary a freelancer can fool around 20 months - to carry out only one project.  This is the dream of any employee. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d5c/d72/383/d5cd7238353049aebf88609829c29ada.png" alt="image"></div><br><br>  And all such: "There must be some kind of catch!".  They sit at home, they don‚Äôt go to work, they don‚Äôt bow to the boss and earn money normally.  In the United States in general, 60% of remote employees said they began to earn more after leaving regular jobs (according to the <i>Freelancers Union</i> ).  They also have a shorter working day.  Obviously something is not clean.  Maybe they are LGBT?  Or hate black?  And, exactly, they have gender discrimination!  Even <i><a href="https://www.payoneer.com/ru/">Payoneer</a></i> confirms this: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5d8/ccf/d7c/5d8ccfd7c47a48a49f16cd783c0332ae.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><br>  Well, at least in something they are worse.  Then everything is fine.  More problems with the withdrawal of funds and <a href="https://megamozg.ru/company/polyglot/blog/24818/">how freelancers work legally</a> - they do not quite understand.  It is good that at least something is bad for them.  In Russia, SMM payers have to pay less, according <a href="http://www.cossa.ru/149/122663/">to</a> <i>Cossa</i> .  Rumor has it that they do not affect sales at all.  Well, sure back soon everyone will return from their Internet sites.  Meanwhile, in Villaribo, the demand for digital specialists continued to grow: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4ab/026/b08/4ab026b084854b209d0795f69d9c2ef0.png" alt="image"></div><br><br><h4>  <b>Is it profitable to work remotely</b> </h4><br><br>  So, the average hourly rate of a Ukrainian working for his uncle is on average $ 1 per hour, and a Russian is $ 2.5.  The average rate of freelancers in all areas in the world according to <i>Payoneer</i> is $ 21 / hour.  Not surprisingly, almost half of the independent specialists in the world (47%) are satisfied with their earnings.  Interestingly, how many full-time employees are satisfied with their salary?  Wanghui, that this indicator tends to zero.  Naturally, working less for an hour a day and getting 10-20 times more - how can you not spread a wide smile.  Although <a href="https://2polyglot.com/ru/search/copywriter">copywriters</a> and <a href="https://2polyglot.com/ru/search/translator">translators are</a> more dissatisfied with their earnings than programmers, but they work the least - 36.9 hours a week.  Maybe that's why their average bet is $ 13? <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/da3/07a/1ae/da307a1ae0a04baabc8c4b306e62e254.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><br><h5>  Summing up: </h5><br><ul><li>  The work day of a freelancer lasts an average of 7 hours a day. </li><li>  47% of freelancers are happy with their earnings. </li><li>  Freelance lawyers put average price tags at $ 31 / hour (apparently, according to the law, they are supposed to be the most). </li><li>  83% of freelancers have a higher education (apparently, it was useful, since the freelancers have moved). </li><li>  8% of freelancers get the biggest income - $ 51- $ 100 (Pareto principle, is that you?). </li><li>  The average rate of freelancers with higher education is $ 19, and without - $ 18 (5 years of study were not in vain!). </li></ul><br><br>  This is far from all the positive aspects of outsource work, but it‚Äôs quite enough to start working for yourself and earn with your knowledge.  Therefore, if you are a translator, copywriter or foreign language tutor, <a href="https://2polyglot.com/ru/user/register">register</a> on the <i>2Polyglot</i> freelance platform and apply for order fulfillment! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299662/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299662/</a></p>
