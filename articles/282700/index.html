In the field of IT security, knowledge transmitted in various ways is the very weapon whose use is limited not so much by the norms of the Criminal Code as by ethical choice. <br><br>  It is impossible to become a professional in the field of information security without understanding the intricacies of penetration and the detection of vulnerabilities.  All the books in today's collection are similar to a loaded rifle that you want to have as a defense: they are required for studying both novice security researchers and specialists who want to expand the boundaries of knowledge. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  Part 1.

Tests are conducted on the basis of the Kali Linux platform - the main operating system (OS) for penetration tests and security checks. <br><br>  Georgia Weidman is professionally engaged in testing, is the founder of the security consulting company Bulb Security, speaks at conferences such as Black Hat, ShmooCon and DerbyCon.  She also received a FastTrack DARPA Cyber ‚Äã‚Äãgrant to continue working in the field of mobile device security.  To create the book, Georgia was attracted by a well-known researcher in narrow circles - Peter Van Eeckhoutteaka (corelanc0d3r), the founder of Corelan Security Team. <br><br>  The book is suitable for a beginner who wants to understand the principles of the work of hackers and use the same methods and tools to protect their systems from attack.  On the 500 pages, you will find good examples and instructions on various topics, including areas of exploit development, carrying out attacks on mobile operating systems, social engineering, and bypassing antivirus systems. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Penetration-Testers-Source-Toolkit-Third/dp/1597496278/ref%3Dsr_1_1%3Fs%3Dbooks%26ie%3DUTF8%26qid%3D1461586506%26sr%3D1-1%26keywords%3DPenetration%2BTester%2527s%2BOpen%2BSource%2BToolkit">Penetration Tester's Open Source Toolkit</a></b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2fd/aa6/d9c/2fdaa6d9cbcf463483a717fb17391818.jpg"><br><br>  Each chapter of the Open Source Toolkit focuses on a specific area of ‚Äã‚Äãtesting.  The book describes the existing opensource-tools that can be used to conduct a penetration test. <br><br>  Large commercial testing tools can be not only very expensive, but also difficult to use.  This book helps to solve both problems.  The Open Source Toolkit is dedicated to the techniques and methodologies for testing various kinds of server applications using open source tools (read free), which can be modified by the Pentester for each specific situation. <br><br>  The author of the book - Jeremy Faircloth has been working in the industry for over 20 years.  During this time, he has become an expert in many areas: web development, database administration, corporate security, network design, application development, and project management.  He led several technical teams in companies that are in the world ranking of the 50 largest in terms of revenue.  Jeremy has written over a dozen technical books covering various IT topics. <br><br>  The third edition of the Open Source Toolkit (2011) is currently available.  The release of the fourth, amended version <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Penetration-Testers-Source-Toolkit-Fourth/dp/0128021497/ref%3Dsr_1_3%3Fs%3Dbooks%26ie%3DUTF8%26qid%3D1461586506%26sr%3D1-3%26keywords%3DPenetration%2BTester%2527s%2BOpen%2BSource%2BToolkit">announced</a> at the end of 2016. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/CEH-Official-Certified-Ethical-Hacker/dp/0782144373">Certified Ethical Hacker Review Guide</a></b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d83/1cb/98c/d831cb98c9e14349a61656399275ab9c.jpg"><br><br>  The official CEH certification exam preparation guide will help you identify security risks for networks and computers.  The manual covers the whole range of hacking issues of modern systems.  It doesn‚Äôt matter whether you have the goal of becoming an ethical hacker certified or not - the book will be useful to all security professionals. <br><br>  The manual begins with an explanation of the concept of ethical hacking, then the technical features of real methods of hacking, the introduction of malicious software, social engineering, denial of service, cryptography, etc. are described.  The book is suitable for people with a university level of knowledge, having an understanding of the basic network protocols and principles of the network infrastructure. <br><br>  The quality of leadership is the responsibility of the American organization International Council of E-Commerce Consultants (EC-Council). <br><br>  <b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Metasploit-Penetration-Testers-David-Kennedy/dp/159327288X">Metasploit: The Penetration Tester's Guide</a></b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9c5/074/195/9c507419548743f0a16eccc2c05859a5.jpg"><br><br>  Another useful book for those who want to learn ethical hacking.  It is dedicated to the popular hacker framework Metasploit, designed to create and debug exploits.  The book is ideal for beginners to learn Metasploit - it describes data collection using NeXpose Community Edition and Ness, playing hide-and-seek with antiviruses through MSFencode, creating fake access points via Karmetasploit and intercepting passwords, encrypting the shell-code to hide the attack from IDS or IPS and others. <br><br>  If you are wondering how seemingly inexperienced hacker groups seem to make various hacks, this book will provide a comprehensive explanation of the variety of simple attacks. <br><br>  A necessary skill is knowledge of Ruby, since in 2007 Metasploit was transferred from Perl to Ruby, so all the code in this book is written in Ruby. <br><br>  A large and very experienced team of authors worked on the book: security specialist David Kennedy (TrustedSec company), president of Offensive Security Jim O'Gorman (created Kali Linux in the same company, and she is also one of the main developers of Metasploit), Devon Kearns specialist (worked on projects Backtrack, Kali Linux and Metasploit), developer Mati Aharoni (Kali Linux, Whoppix). <br><br>  <b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Rtfm-Red-Team-Field-Manual/dp/1494295504">RTFM: Red Team Field Manual</a></b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eac/58b/a8c/eac58ba8c21f42a39604be700c3f0d9b.jpg"><br><br>  The Red Team Field Manual (RTFM) is a 100-page handbook for the Pentester - a bit of everything on Windows, Cisco IOS platforms, also covering various scenarios in Powershell, Python, and Scapy, and mentioning several handy Linux commands. <br><br>  Red Team are ‚Äúwhite hackers‚Äù working for you and conducting attacks on your information system.  Ben Clark, the director of the company with the talking title Cyber ‚Äã‚ÄãSecurity, originally wrote this book as a reference for his red team, and received permission from his employer to publish. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Shellcoders-Handbook-Discovering-Exploiting-Security/dp/047008023X">Shellcoder's Handbook</a></b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e29/1ba/ae4/e291baae475b4619858690da1027b8bf.jpg"><br><br>  A group of leading experts in the field of information security has written one of the best books on how to find holes in any operating system or application.  The book describes methods for writing Windows shellcodes, attacks on stack overflow, as well as violations of the correct functioning of the open systems kernel. <br><br>  The range of issues raised in the 700-page book is huge!  24 chapters are divided into four parts: <br><br><ul><li>  Part one offers an introduction to exploits and focuses on Linux; </li><li>  The second part of the book covers the Windows platform, Solaris, Tru64, and adds information about shell codes; </li><li>  The third part is based on the search for vulnerabilities: methods for introducing faults, fuzzing, source code testing, tracing, binary audits, etc .; </li><li>  The fourth part of the book covers alternative strategies for writing exploits that will work in the real world, attacks on database software and kernel vulnerabilities. </li></ul><br>  This book is a must-have musthave for professionals for whom learning hacking techniques and countering hacking is a lifelong pursuit. <br><br>  About the authors: <br><ul><li>  Dave Aitel at the age of 18 got a job as a research assistant at the US National Security Agency, where he worked for six years.

This is one of those books that simply must be in the library of every Android application developer.  After a detailed explanation of the operating principles of the OS and its general security architecture, the authors explore the vulnerabilities that can be discovered for various components of the system. <br><br>  It is difficult to find a book that would be compared with this in the detailed study of the security of Android applications.  Each chapter is self-sufficient, so that you can receive information on specific topics without re-reading the entire manual.  At the same time, this publication cannot be recommended to beginners in the field of IT security: to understand what is written, you need to know the basics of security of network systems, as well as the experience of Android development.  In some places, knowledge of assembler is also useful to you. <br><br>  About the authors: <br><br><ul><li>  Joshua J.

If you're wondering how to create truly effective hacking tools, pay attention to Python. <br><br>  In Black Hat Python, you will learn how to write sniffers, manipulate packages, infect virtual machines, create Trojans using Git Hub, do custom keyloggers, write an extension to Burp Suite (a set of utilities for pentesting), most secretly display data from the network another. <br><br>  The book takes you through the creation of classic networking tools in Python before writing your own malicious software ... to show how hackers get into your computer, steal data secretly and for a long time retain anonymous access to your resources.  In addition, you will learn how to independently create software for detecting and neutralizing enemy attacks. <br><br>  The volume of the book is small - 161 pages, most of which are screenshots and code samples.  But it can not be recommended to beginners, because you need a good experience with Python, besides it can not be used as a reference.  Instead, you need to set yourself Linux Kali and go through all the proposed tasks step by step. <br><br>  The author of the book is Justin Seitz, a senior security officer at Immunity.  He is also the author of another popular book on this topic - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Gray-Hat-Python-Programming-Engineers/dp/1593271921/">Gray Hat Python - Python Programming for Hackers and Reverse Engineers</a> .  Gray Hat Python appeared earlier, in 2009, and covers topics such as creating debuggers, trojans, fuzzers, and emulators.  There is also no pure theory, all examples are accompanied by code that really needs to be worked with, and besides it, you can explore an extensive set of open source tools, including PyDbg, Debugger Sulley, IDA Python, PyEMU. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Violent-Python-Cookbook-Penetration-Engineers/dp/1597499579">Violent Python a Cookbook for Hackers</a></b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c1c/25f/ee8/c1c25fee8beb44c0aafb85c8941c15a7.jpg"><br><br>  Another book that will suit the Pythonists.  It reveals the theme of the transition from understanding the theoretical foundations of "combat programming" to practical implementation.  Instead of relying on the tools of another attacker, the book will teach you how to create your own weapon using Python.  Violent Python a Cookbook for Hackers describes how to automate large-scale network attacks using scripts, how to extract metadata, write code to intercept and analyze network traffic, and how to attack wireless networks and how to hide its activity from antivirus attention. <br><br>  About the author: TJ O'Connor is an information security expert for the US Department of Defense.

In Mail.Ru Group itself there is an information security department, where we do our favorite business - penetration tests.  All the books mentioned in this review are somehow related to our work, and without them it is difficult to imagine the training of highly qualified specialists. <br><br>  You can always continue this list, guided by several criteria.  Virtually every author from the review writes regularly, publishing new textbooks or updating old ones, relating the material to the demands of the times.  So watch out for their new publications.  In addition, there is a good rating system on the same Amazon and often adequate comments appear on new security books, which should also be noted. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/282700/">https://habr.com/ru/post/282700/</a></p>
