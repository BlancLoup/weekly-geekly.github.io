  <section class="page js-page"><h1>One week in the life of Ekaterinburg MakeXLab hackspace</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Despite the fact that more than two months have passed since the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthis post, we still decided to finish it and publish it by the end of the year.  The idea was simple - to show in pictures one week (or a bit more) of the life of our hackspace MakeItLab. <br><br>  I will remind, on October 16, at 01:08 - the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/coolrf/blog/197708/">first publication about MakeItLab</a> on <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/coolrf/blog/197708/">Habr√©</a> appeared.  On the nearest Saturday (October 19), a meeting was scheduled with participants from Yekaterinburg, who were interested in the Hackspace movement.  Partly from this, the end of that week, and all the following, were extremely eventful. <br><br>  So let's get started.

    <h4>  Saturday (October 19) </h4><br>  On the open day was 12 people.  There were certainly more people willing, but for a room of 26 square meters it is almost the limit. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9fe/2a3/5b0/9fe2a35b0330d65fa20929cd18e7ed42.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/06c/435/a1d/06c435a1dee2ab9b99a73ad1c6d1b2c7.jpg"><br><br>  On the same day, already in the evening, we received a translation <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/makeitlab/blog/199374/">from Mitsch Altman</a> ‚Äôs <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/makeitlab/blog/199374/">speech about hackspace</a> from one of our fellow linguists. <br><br>  Actually, translations are another useful activity of ours.  There are many great tutorials, courses, and other educational information in English.  For example, now we are translating courses for Snap! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Sunday (October 20) </h4><br>  An offline meeting of the CoolRF home automation project (an element of the smart home) took place. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f2f/2a9/eb5/f2f2a9eb55787469bec29625aeb48947.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c43/f72/e61/c43f72e616a805fe037ca735acc1f0f3.jpg"><br><br>  At the meeting, very interesting components were demonstrated, including: an RGB lamp controlled from a phone (glows red in the background), Vyacheslav Anisimov's CoolRF project, and other interesting things.  Actually, the main emphasis was just on the "smart dimmer" Vyacheslav. <br><br>  After the party was over, they began to collect the Fritz robot head. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dd7/b2a/b39/dd7b2ab39671ebd67c5a47e08183b75d.jpg"><br><br>  If anyone is interested, we accept orders :) A very interesting thing turned out, but more on that later ... <br><br>  Finally, on the same day, they prepared and published a questionnaire of participants of the hackspace.  We consider as participants those who are willing to attend this institution and make their projects in it, while helping in every way. <br><br><h4>  Monday (October 21) </h4><br>  In the evening, one of our 3D-printer took part in an unusual performance.  We were invited to the thematic disco PICTUREPLANE. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/803/f02/3de/803f023de685236e2b3a744f050fc256.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bc6/c57/639/bc6c57639bc046441f1a4410c289cffb.jpg"><br><br>  A very rewarding experience of directly promoting the ideas of 3D printing.  The simplest people approached the apparatus, asked, wondered.  They really wanted to try on made bracelets (which, by the way, were shining in the ultraviolet of the disco).  As a result, four bracelets were imperceptibly carried away by girls :) <br><br><h4>  Tuesday (October 22) </h4><br>  At last, the field tests of our quadrocopter have taken place.  Probably it will seem trivial to many, but in our case the event was really significant.  The machine has an unusual control layout, and is coded from scratch.  The tests took place late in the evening, so the video turned out very dark: ( <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/dqVQoNwUAN4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjIhKKhds27dqQ9DKgoRBZCnhWBtQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  At the moment, quadcopter is brought to mind.  In particular, from day to day we will put a lighter battery, and we will pass the engine stroke controls. <br><br><h4>  Wednesday (October 23) </h4><br>  The morning of the day began with <a href="http://www.obltv.ru/news/science/pechat_juvelirnyh_ukrashenij_na_printere__uzhe_sejchas/">an interview with the</a> local television channel, OTV.  The report was devoted only to one of our areas - 3D printing.  Well, as always, they made only a few minutes of unintelligible video from the recorded hour: (but oh well. <br><br>  In the evening of the same day they held an open seminar ‚ÄúHackerspace‚Äù.  They told about what this institution is.  On the history of the movement hackspeys.  Some participants of the seminar managed to really get interested and make their supporters. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/wghI5bmC54M%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjWP1cR55KASpNUu8YQo3MvMJND6A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h4>  Thursday (October 24th) </h4><br>  Again a small party of new people gathered.  In particular, we were visited by <a href="http://alex-exe.ru/">Alex_EXE</a> , a very interesting person with a very interesting blog. <br><br>  Communication smoothly turned into solving urgent problems.  Experienced window lifter motors for current consumption.  Probably adapt it to the tracked platform. <br> <a href="http://vk.com/video30490172_166342580"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9d3/441/22e/9d344122ea1e541e867392d28e846719.jpg"></a> <br><br>  In the evening, a letter came from Baghdad - Hackspace (FikraSpace) is being organized there asking to make a short video about us, about the Hackspace movement. <br><br><h4>  Friday (October 25) </h4><br>  But Friday formed the input :) <br><br><h4>  Saturday (October 26) </h4><br>  Almost collected robogolovu.  Printed on a 3D printer details of the eyes. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ed0/855/b7f/ed0855b7fad4b17dcb6cdc742062bfaa.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Sunday (October 27): </h4><br>  The next ones willing to participate in the life of a hackspace: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f45/7f2/b55/f457f2b55226ebf73c09f69cc0a41ae5.jpg"><br><br>  One of the girls who came to the meeting, by the way, later volunteered to hold a master class on electronics installation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/753/d2c/ac2/753d2cac2a3679531236a394c1df7b06.jpg"><br><br>  Towards evening we finally fixed the shelves and filled them with boxes.  Everything turned out as in the classic hackspace :) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/385/a82/923/385a829239cebd6355554f977a10c229.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7d7/72a/bc0/7d772abc07c06a2bda33e8ab2ab62969.jpg"><br><br>  Well, already quite by nightfall, one of the residents completed his ‚Äúuseless device‚Äù. <br> <a href="http://vk.com/video30490172_166914828"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/128/d2b/331/128d2b33163f4c541004500f29734409.jpg"></a> <br><br>  In general, after two months, the pace has not decreased - in the hackspace, life is constantly full of life, projects are moving, new knowledge is acquired, new connections are made.  I think after the new year, we will write about the next eventful week. <br>  Well, of course, the latest information about the life of a hackspace can be obtained from <a href="https://vk.com/makeitlab">our VKontakte group</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/200102/">https://habr.com/ru/post/200102/</a></p>
