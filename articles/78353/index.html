      Now about what the ‚ÄúBig Three‚Äù are already offering and going to offer.  In addition to the general words on the topic of ‚Äúexpand and deepen,‚Äù a certain amount of specifics is present in the announced plans of the operators.  And even information about future tariff offers, ‚Äútied‚Äù to the use of high-speed data.  Let's try to sort through the heaps of information that have fallen on us and assess the immediate prospects. <br><br><h4>  <b>Mts</b> </h4><br>  <b>Made</b> to date, "background" and the sequence of events.  As it was rightly noted in a press release, ‚ÄúThe launch of 3G networks in Moscow became possible after MTS and other Big Three operators received positive results of field tests for electromagnetic compatibility of 3G equipment with radio electronic equipment for military use.‚Äù Restrictions on 3G work outside buildings they have only been removed in areas remote from Moscow for 100 km or more. <br><ul><li>  May 8, 2009 - by the decision of FSUE HRCHC, MTS received UMTS radio frequencies of 2.1 GHz for base stations of third generation cellular networks (3G) in Moscow, Moscow Region, as well as in a number of regions of the Central Region of the Russian Federation. </li><li>  May 25, 2009 - MTS implemented the first phase of connecting to the 3G network of indoor objects in the capital, on the territory of Expocentre on Krasnaya Presnya. </li><li>  June 30, 2009 - MTS introduced the 3G network in the Moscow Oblast cities of Orekhovo-Zuyevo and Noginsk into commercial operation, and also expanded the indoor coverage of the 3G network from MTS in the capital.  The 3G network has become available to users on the territory of the Lotte Plaza business center and the Crocus City shopping center. </li><li>  July 8, 2009 - MTS was the first among mobile network operators to launch a 3G network in commercial operation in the Moscow Metro.  The first metro station, where the 3G network appeared, was ‚ÄúUniversity‚Äù.  The next phase of the 3G MTS network in the metro is the Lenin Library, Preobrazhenskaya Square and Chistye Prudy. </li><li>  December 11, 2009 - MTS was the first among the Big Three operators in December to provide the Moscow Metro's Ring Line with continuous (at stations and in tunnels) communications and uninterrupted mobile Internet access via the 3G network. </li></ul><br>  Today, the networks of the ‚Äúthird generation‚Äù from MTS operate in 48 cities in all federal districts of Russia.  The growth of 3G traffic in MTS networks in Russia in 3 square meters.  compared to 2 square meters.  2009 was 41%.  Regions with the largest volume of 3G traffic - Novosibirsk, St. Petersburg, Sochi, Kazan, Vladivostok.  Today, more than half of active users of 3G services from MTS generate on average about 1GB of traffic per month.  After the launch of the third generation in-door network in Moscow in May of this year, the volume of 3G traffic is growing at a rapid pace.  For example, in the first two months of the 4th quarter (October and November), the volume of data transfer in the metropolitan 3G MTS network increased by 23% compared to the end of the 3rd quarter. <br><br>  <b>Immediate plans.</b>  MTS considers the intensive deployment of 3G networks to stimulate the consumption of data and content transmission services and increase subscriber loyalty as one of its strategic priorities.  The projected volume of MTS investments in the development of 3G networks in Russia in 2008-2009 is about $ 700 million.  MTS received permission to establish in Moscow 783 UMTS base stations.  First of all, the 3G outdoor network from MTS will cover the central part of Moscow within the borders of the third transport ring, in the main business districts of the capital, on key transport highways and transport hubs within the Moscow Ring Road. <br><br><h4>  <b>Beeline</b> </h4><br>  <b>Made by</b>  According to the research agency J'son and Partners, VimpelCom is currently the leader among Russian 3G roaming operators, as well as in the geography of providing third generation services on a nationwide scale.  As of the end of November, the Company had fulfilled its license obligations of the first stage and ensured the launch of 3G networks in all constituent entities of the Russian Federation. <br><br>  From May of this year to the present, the Olimpiysky sports complex, Liga shopping center, Domodedovo and Sheremetyevo 2 airports, as well as the central office of VimpelCom have been provided with third-generation communication from Beeline.  Technically ready to launch is the Pushkinsky metro station, the Barrikadnaya, Krasnopresnenskaya, Lubyanka, Kitay-Gorod, Kuznetsky Most stations, as well as a number of office and shopping centers, including Crocus Expo , Ramstore City, office center (Krylatskaya, 17) and other objects. <br><br>  <b>Immediate plans.</b>  Permits were obtained for about 1,000 base stations. By the end of the year, the company plans to launch several dozen large indoor facilities and implement a targeted coverage improvement program for corporate clients. <br><br>  For this event, for its existing and potential subscribers, Beeline timed the launch of a new tariff offer that will allow users to appreciate all the advantages of mobile broadband Internet at the most favorable price at the moment among mobile operators that have received 3G licenses.  For users of USB - modems, the tariff implies special conditions for data transfer: the cost of a package with 1 GB of internet traffic is 495 rubles, a package with 3 GB - 795 rubles.  After exceeding these volumes, the cost of 1 MB of traffic is 2 rubles.  For users of phones with 3G support, 2 unique package offers are also provided: the cost of a package with 1 Gb of Internet traffic is 495 rubles, a package with 3 GB - 795 rubles. <br><br><h4>  <b>Megaphone</b> </h4><br>  <b>Made by</b>  Today in Moscow, MegaFon already provides 3G (indoor) signal with business centers and hotels, hypermarkets, train stations, airports, a number of metro stations and other facilities that Moscow residents and guests of the capital frequent.  In the Moscow region, new network services (indoor and outdoor) are available in the cities of Balashikha, Krasnogorsk, Lyubertsy, Noginsk, Pavlovsky Posad, Pushkino, Solnechnogorsk, Khimki, Elektrostal, on the territories adjacent to cities and sections of suburban highways.  As of the beginning of December, about 25% of residents and guests of the Moscow region are in the zone of the first segment of the new network every day.  The total number of MegaFon subscribers in Moscow and the Moscow Region exceeds 7.3 million users ... <br><br>  <b>Immediate plans.</b>  ‚Äú... MegaFon is leading in terms of 3G deployment in the metropolitan area, we intend to be the first to serve 3G subscribers on the streets of Moscow.  If all the documents necessary for a commercial launch are processed under an accelerated scheme, MegaFon will be able to start phasing-in 3G base stations in Moscow for servicing outside subscribers even before the New Year ... ‚Äù(First Deputy General Director of MegaFon OJSC Valery Yermakov) .  The first 3G (outdoor) base stations will appear in almost all districts of Moscow.  As a priority, the operator intends to include the historical center of Moscow, business districts and key highways in the coverage area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe new network.  A program is also being prepared for the deployment of a 3G network in residential areas of the Russian capital and in the Moscow metro. <br><br>  In accordance with the obtained permits, the total number of 3G base stations in Moscow and the Moscow Region by the end of 2009 will be 700 units, in the spring of 2010 it will exceed 1000 units.  The operator‚Äôs long-term plans are to place in the capital region more than 3,000 third-generation base stations, which will provide access to new services to all residents of the capital and the Moscow region.  For active users, a special tariff offer "Unlimited Internet" has been created. <br><br><h4>  <b>Comment "in brackets"</b> </h4><br>  From the voiced operator plans, one might get the impression that only Beeline was concerned about the release of special 3G tariffs.  In fact, this is certainly not the case.  Over the past months, operators have systematically and consistently brought to the market new tariffs and services, clearly focused on the near "trizhevizatsiyu" of the Moscow region.  And they also corrected and ‚Äúoptimized‚Äù existing offers taking into account future 3G realities.  The process has been going on for quite a long time, we timely dismantle all the interesting novelties and upgrades along the way of the play and ‚Äútry on‚Äù them for the future. <br>  changes in mobile data. <br><br>  Another interesting detail is the mention of a video call that flashed across the press release as one of the available services on the MTS 3G network.  We must assume that we managed to cope with administrative obstacles and the service will soon work. <br><br><h4>  <b>Opinion analysts</b> </h4><br>  ‚Äú... the most notable news in this area has recently been the entry of these operators into the Moscow market.  According to J'son &amp; Partners Consulting, despite the presence of competition in the Moscow market for providing high-speed mobile Internet access services from such companies as Skylink, Scartel (Yota brand) and Comstar-UTS, 3G The services that the Big Three operators will provide will also find their consumers.  According to J'son &amp; Partners Consulting, attracting subscribers to the UMTS network will be largely due to the existing distribution of 3G phones. <br><br>  According to J'son &amp; Partners Consulting, by the end of 2009, the cash fleet of mobile phones that have support for UMTS networks may exceed 13 million terminals; in the 3rd quarter of 2009, 1 million UMTS phones were sold in Russia. <br><br>  According to the research of J'son &amp; Partners Consulting, the results of the quarter in question showed a negative trend regarding the results of the 3rd quarter of 2008 - the decline in sales in physical terms was about 24%.  On the other hand, compared with the 2nd quarter of 2009, this figure increased by 6%.  According to J'son &amp; Partners Consulting, the ‚Äúslowdown‚Äù in sales of 3G phones in 2009 is due to the following factors: <br><ul><li>  Decline in consumer spending of the population: in a crisis, the demand for low-cost mobile phones has grown.  If in 2008 the average retail price of a mobile phone was at the level of $ 200, then with the onset of the crisis, this figure dropped to the level of 150 - 160 dollars.  There was also a reduction in effective demand. </li><li>  The weakening of the market position of the company SonyEricsson: phones with support for third-generation networks accounted for about half of all sales.  By the end of Q3, the position of this manufacturer in the market as a whole significantly weakened, which affected the segment of 3G phones. </li></ul><br>  In monetary terms, sales of 3G terminals in Q3 2009, according to research by J'son &amp; Partners Consulting, exceeded $ 414 million. <br><br>  <a href="http://mobile-review.com/">A source</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/78353/">https://habr.com/ru/post/78353/</a></p>
