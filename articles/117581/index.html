      I had one task for my job, which I described in the article <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/social_networks/111142/">In which social networks to search for clients</a> .  From the comments it became clear that I was not the only one interested in similar statistics.  Since the process of its collection is very laborious and time consuming, the idea itself was asked: to automate. <br><br>  At first I had the thought: ‚Äúso, I don‚Äôt have much free time, so an assistant wouldn‚Äôt hurt me.‚Äù All attempts to find an ally were unsuccessful.  Well, it was impossible to make it so that everyone was good, and all were treated with small casualties.  I conducted searches among friends and acquaintances.  There are already two programmers, one php-shnik, the second java.  If we consider that I am a perlovschik, then we get the plot of Krylov's fable "The Swan, Cancer and Pike." <br><br>  I think, okay, give up early.  I‚Äôm going to the conference, and I‚Äôm definitely meeting each other there.  Came  In general, while I gained the courage to go to someone and get acquainted - the conference was over and everyone ran away.  Do you think my case is treatable?  (do not offer alcohol). <br><br>  I console myself: well, it's okay, I will sleep for an hour less, thus I will find time. <br><br>  Invented the milabris domain - this is in Latin (type of beetle).  He began to confuse him with malibris, eventually settled on <a href="http://milaba.com/">milaba.com</a> .  By the way, if you need to come up with a good domain, use Latin, sometimes it helps a lot. <br><br>  While working on the project, I realized that it is very fragile and I need to act quickly, but nevertheless I took the risk. <br><br>  After all, the basis is the bots that create the address book based on the downloaded email addresses, enter the social network and use the invite friends function to see who is in this network and who is not.  There were a lot of nuances here, starting with the calculation of the ban period for such bots and the number of emails that the social network service can handle at one time. <br><br>  Here is an example of what happened: <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/eVoKdsRGCPc%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhibDIgh06fi8G3i5GHU18szGuUpew" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Yes, I agree, voice-over came out gay, you need to train.  For those who are too lazy to look, the idea is in two words: choose the social network in which to search, download emails, at the output we get a diagram of how many and where it sits. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/6d0a99b3/82ddbaf8/7f9864b1/8e714bea.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/e9268527/0b541b00/0df9815c/f63a849d.png"><br><br>  But it soon began, something I was afraid of.  The first swallow is VKontakte, closed the registration and at the same time recorded the option to invite a friend.  Then classmates also fell off.  As a result, the service currently works only with Facebook and Linkedin. <br><br>  Is there a future for this project?  And the devil knows, if someone benefits, that is already good. <br><br>  What I want to implement: <br><ul><li>  relationship report: soap - a link to the profile in the social.  network (thus, it will be possible to search for a person on the soap among social. networks) </li><li>  also, for example for online stores, you can tell which client is the most socially active (that is, he is in several social networks and has many friends there), maybe the store will offer him a discount, and he will tell friends about it <br></li><li>  still as an option, you can consider the purchasing power of users from a specific social.  network, and if you add advisory calculations, then the store can show which emails are friends with each other.  (based on this: if email1 is friends with email2, then maybe the product that email1 bought zanteresuet email2) </li><li>  Well, it's over as I add all the options about which you ask </li></ul><br>  That's actually so far all that he managed to do on the millab. <br><br>  <b>Ogol</b> <br><br>  In parallel with this, I was doing another project.  But I am afraid that for him you will scold me. <br><br>  We all remember how the creators of Habr made a dribbler.ru, then froze it and now launched again, but somehow it has not yet taken root.  I love to read Habra, but I also love football, so it turned out <s>football Habr</s> <a href="http://ogogol.net/">Ogogol</a> . <br><br>  In this collective blog for karma, you can make predictions for matches.  There is also a feed where you can see everything that happens with friends and it is also very convenient to follow the answers in the topics.  Soon I will make it possible to celebrate your favorite football players and teams.  In general, there are a lot of things to be realized. <br><br>  I started it with a friend, he writes articles, I program.  Friendship lasted for 2 weeks.  Realizing that this is not an easy job and earnings will not start soon, he quickly disappeared from view.  I have already begun to seriously think about what might be wrong with me?  In the end, I found a guy who was paying $ 200-300 a month, and he quietly scratches interesting things about football there. <br><br>  Call these projects profitable or innovative - yes no, of course.  But I look at them and my soul rejoices, because I know that I at least tried it and I know what it costs. <br><br>  In total, I spent 4 months on development.  If these projects seem interesting to someone, then I will be very happy about the partnership.  Since alone I will not last long.  And after reading the books (mentioned above), I slowly begin to descend to the ground. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/117581/">https://habr.com/ru/post/117581/</a></p>
