By the end of November, more than 500,000 connections in Moscow were spoken about at the end of November.  By the first days of December, Tele2 had already sold 816,000 SIM-cards in the Moscow region, a source close to its shareholders said. <a name="habracut"></a>

      Representatives of Tele2 and Rostelecom say only that they are ‚Äúvery satisfied‚Äù with the results of the operator‚Äôs work in Moscow: they are above expectations.  Tele2 has 500 branded stores, and in addition its contracts are sold to 11,000 points of partners. <cut><br><br>  At the end of November, <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/21472/">a</a> new section ‚Äútariffs and sim-cards‚Äù <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/21472/">appeared</a> on the website of the Ulmart online store.  Tele2 was the first among the ‚Äúbig four‚Äù operators to launch the sale of sim-cards in the online store. <br>  Starting from December 2015, residents of Moscow and the region can connect to the Tele2 network through the Yulmart online store.  Visitors can choose a number and a tariff plan on the store‚Äôs website. <br><br>  Tele2 is working with an online retailer in a revenue-sharing scheme (sharing part of the revenue from a connected subscriber), a Tele2 representative said.  The head of the program of projects ‚ÄúDigital goods and payment services‚Äù of Yulmarth, Mikhail Daikhin, said that in the first month from the start of sales it is planned to implement more than 10 thousand Tele2 contracts. <br><br>  The operator is already cooperating with the branches of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%25BE%25D1%2587%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25A0%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8">the Post of Russia</a> , <a href="http://www.fapmc.ru/">the Rospechat</a> kiosks, the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25AD%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BE_(%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D1%258C_%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2)">Eldorado</a> electronics stores, and the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D1%258F%25D1%2582%25D1%2591%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D1%2587%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0">Pyaterochka</a> and <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582_(%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D1%258C_%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2)">Magnit</a> grocery chains.  Tele2 traditionally pays a lot of attention to sales in the ‚Äúnon-core‚Äù channels for the cellular market, Prokshin confirms.  This allows the company to organize the widest possible sales network within walking distance from potential customers and in the most visited places. <br><br>  One of Tele2's partners <a href="http://www.vedomosti.ru/technology/articles/2015/12/18/621556-tele2-podklyuchila-million-abonentov-moskve">told</a> Vedomosti that in its stores (cooperating with Tele2 under the franchise scheme) the contracts of the fourth operator were sold very actively in October-November: 800 sim-cards per store per month.  In December, the results will be a little worse, he suggests, but he believes it is possible that within a month and a half the company gained 1 million subscribers in the capital.  A person close to <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2595%25D0%25B2%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D1%258C">Euroset</a> admits this possibility: Tele2 sim cards diverge well, but Euroset is not the largest sales channel.  According to Prokshin, about 50% of the operator‚Äôs sales are provided by branded stores. <br><br>  Another operator that recently launched a mobile communications network in Moscow is <a href="http://www.yota.ru/">Yota</a> (MegaFon‚Äôs subsidiary): since August 2014, it has been offering not only mobile Internet connections, but also voice communication.  At the end of September 2015, the operator had 1.5 million subscribers to these services, his representative said. <br><br>  Net connections to Tele2 coincide with market expectations, said Denis Kuskov, general director of Telecom Daily, an analytic agency, but the actual results of the launch in Moscow can be judged later when the operator calls the outflow level.  Both this indicator and the further dynamics of the connections will largely depend on the satisfaction of subscribers with the services of the operator, states Kuskov.  Recently, Telecom Daily released a report in which Tele2 named the second-highest quality network in Moscow. <br><br>  Representatives of MTS and VimpelCom did not comment on the success of a competitor.  Unofficially, their employees are of the opinion that there are about 100,000 active subscribers who send sms and are calling MTS and VimpelCom subscribers. The representative of MegaFon says that the operator did not notice any changes since October: subscribers is growing steadily. </cut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297392/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297392/</a></p>
