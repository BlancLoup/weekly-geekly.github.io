Similar proposals were heard more than once, and APC was considered a natural candidate.  But <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259B%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D1%2584,_%25D0%25A0%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D0%25BC%25D1%2583%25D1%2581">Rasmus Lerdorf</a> and other core developers have repeatedly said that APC has not yet reached the stable stage and contains too many errors to be included in PHP.  And <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D1%2583%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8,_%25D0%2597%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B2">Zeev Suraski,</a> answering a <a href="http://news.php.net/php.internals/65171">question in php-internals</a> , talks about the possibility of opening the source code of Zend Optimizer + and including it in PHP 5.5.  However, according to the current plan, releases of alpha versions were not planned, and therefore no new features were expected, but the community accepted this news not without enthusiasm and there are chances that the expansion will nevertheless fall into 5.5.  The published RFC document, among other things, contains a comparison of Optimizer + with APC.  Presumably, three possible scenarios will be submitted for voting: 1. Integrate Optimizer + into PHP 5.5.0 with a delay of release of up to 2 months;  2. Integrate Optimizer + in PHP, without delaying release 5.5;  3. Do not integrate Optimizer + into PHP, providing it as an optional component available from PECL. </li><li>  The Zend Framework <a href="http://framework.zend.com/blog/zend-framework-2-0-7-and-2-1-0-released.html">2.0.7, 2.1.0</a> and <a href="http://framework.zend.com/blog//zend-framework-2-1-1-released.html">2.1.1</a> were released right away. If version 2.0.7 is an impressive <a href="">set of fixes</a> , then release 2.1.0 contains many new features, including new components for working with push notifications for iOS and Android devices.  Well, 2.1.1 makes a number of corrections. </li><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/168441/">Announced stable release of MySQL 5.6</a> <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c72/991/4ca/c729914ca9c21661c5abd81052c6a10e.gif">  - Since the release of the previous version 2 years have passed, and this long-awaited release contains many innovations and improvements, especially regarding performance.  It is noteworthy that a little earlier, Fedora and openSUSE <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/oracle-who-fedora-and-opensuse-will-replace-mysql-with-mariadb-7000010640/">announced their intention to</a> replace MySQL with MariaDB in the default installation. </li><li>  <a href="http://webandphp.com/issue-11">11th issue of the Web &amp; PHP magazine</a> - The following topics are covered in the latest issue of the magazine: PHP in the cloud;  Agile thinking development;  Indexing databases;  other. </li><li>  <a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/phpmyadmin/news/2013/02/phpmyadmin-400-beta1-is-released/">Beta release phpMyAdmin 4.0.0</a> - In this version HTML frames are finally removed. </li></ul><br><br><h3><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a1b/ab6/308/a1bab630889567e2a5c9bab3290d8310.png">  Php </h3><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://philsturgeon.co.uk/blog/2013/01/php-6-pissing-in-the-wind">PHP 6 Pissing in the Wind</a> - Excellent post in which the author expresses his point of view about the current situation in the PHP community.  He gives an example of problems in the language that are constantly reproached by PHP-haters, namely: inconsistency of parameters, the absence of <a href="https://github.com/nikic/scalar_objects">scalar objects</a> and unicode support.  First, the author cites an obvious, in his opinion, decision, and then writes about why, after all, no changes are made.  He believes that among core-developers there are too many conservative-minded individuals, and voting for any major changes most often fail, as was the case, for example, with <a href="">accessors</a> .  The author calls for progressive changes, and those who do not want to work on such changes, calls for retirement.  No less interesting were the comments to the post, for example, a detailed response from Zeev Suraski. </li><li>  <a href="http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2013/01/31/php-just-grows-grows.html">PHP is growing and growing</a> - The results of research on PHP usage data for the last 10 years have <a href="http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2013/01/31/php-just-grows-grows.html">been</a> published.

At this time, your attention habraperevod. </li><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/167153/">Types in PHP: good or bad?</a> <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c72/991/4ca/c729914ca9c21661c5abd81052c6a10e.gif">  - Types are of course treits.

And, obviously, information coding takes some time.  In the article, the author described the test results using the built-in serialize / unserialize methods, using the <a href="http://pecl.php.net/package/igbinary">igbinary</a> extension, as well as encoding into a JSON string. </li><li>  <a href="http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/php/laravel-4-a-start-at-a-restful-api/">Laravel 4: Creating a RESTful API</a> - Although Laravel 4 is still in beta, there are already a lot of materials on this framework.

These three methods do not involve the use of any external dependencies such as the queue server, all in pure PHP: opening a socket and closing without waiting for a response;  writing to the log file (pseudo-sequence);  fork of the curl process.  For each method, a small example is given and the advantages / disadvantages of each are considered. </li><li>  <a href="http://css.dzone.com/articles/parallel-phpunit">Parallel PHPUnit</a> - A small post about parallel use of PHPUnit to run multiple test suites at the same time.
