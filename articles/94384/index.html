  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Web Standards Days Riga</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The first time I heard about Web Standards Days from a video shot on RIT.  It was also said there that the next event will be held in Riga. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Similar events a la barkamp are often held in Riga.  But how much I read the reports about them is mostly PR of their projects.  Yes, by itself, the company is going to be interesting and you can meet interesting people.  But all this is somehow trapped and communication takes place mainly in their groups.  Without the opportunity to join in some kind of company, go to listen about the next PR of a product of which I don‚Äôt really want a full Habr. <br><br>  This program has attracted a specific focus on certain chips in different technologies. <br><br><h4>  Program </h4><br>  The program of the meeting can still be found on the official website.  By the time everything went practically without overlays.  The only shift of the program was due to the large number of questions on mobile devices.

    <h5>  Web layout in Latvia: Yesterday.  Today!  Tomorrow?  - Nikita Seletsky </h5><br>  According to the author of the report, about 100 sites were analyzed in different categories when registering for the conference.  Basically, the slides showed statistics in the form of graphs that people use on sites.  For example, which DOCTYPE is most commonly used or which charset.  What and how to use and what it affects. <br>  EM or PX?  The percentage of IE is very small on the market and those who enter it do not always know what scalability is.  So is it worth it for them to suffer? <br>  We will wait for a link to the presentation or video. <br><br><h5>  Features of creating web sites for mobile devices.  - Dmitry Dulepov </h5><br>  The topic is probably shaking people the most.  Mobile devices are increasingly entering our lives.  Even a simple phone with a small screen and a mini opera on board is suitable for full use of the Internet.  When the Ipad is available, everything will probably change even more fundamental.  Many who use it notice for themselves that at home they rarely approach stationary cars. <br>  At the conference, I took with me both a laptop and my old iPOD MOVIE with Wi-Fi.  As I expected at all outlets in the room was not.  But I had no problems sitting the whole conference with my hipod.  Read twitter, climbed on the Internet.  Conveniently, it does not shake the pocket and does not press on the shoulder when you wear a laptop. <br>  It‚Äôs not even a question of whether or not to consider the mobile version of your site.  If you have an interesting resource, you need to consider the usability of your site on mobile devices.  There is such a thing as managing fingers and if you have a menu or other links on your site that are very close, it will make it difficult to use the site.  Also it is worth remembering the problem with flash on mobile devices.  With JAVA, scripts are also not worth much to get involved in.  My project <a href="http://www.schetov.ru/">www.schetov.ru</a> with a large number of Java scripts works fine on my ipod, but as on other mobile devices I honestly haven‚Äôt thought so far. <br>  In the presentation 3 frameworks for the development of sites for mobile versions were considered to a greater extent.  Pros, cons, examples of use.  Everything is very concrete and clear. <br>  If a presentation or video arrives, then all this can be read and evaluated. <br><br><h5>  HTML5 and CSS3.  The evolution of web standards - Anton Nemtsev </h5><br>  In the video RIT was a similar topic.  It was interesting to learn about the new chips CTML5.  The main thing is that most of these chips do not work in many browsers yet.  And in those where it works, it may not appear at all as you expect. <br><br><h5>  CSS management.  Three years later.  - Vadim Makeev </h5><br>  Useful tips for organizing joint CSS development. <br>  <a href="http://pepelsbey.net/pres/css-management/">Presentation</a> . <br><br><h5>  Developer Tools - Which Is Tastier?  - Mikhail Baranov </h5><br>  Firebug and everything around it.  Pros, cons useful tips.  Without a presentation and pictures there can not be said a lot.  If you are a developer, then Firebug can reduce the search for errors in the code by an order of magnitude. <br><br><h5>  Lean Startup.  From idea to million.  - Maxim Birch </h5><br>  PR  For what?  What for?  Questions, but no one even wanted to ask them at the conference. <br>  The book mentioned in the presentation is by the way RE: Work.  If you read Getting Real, then in this book you will find not so much new, much just copy-past.  But the guys from 37 signals are still excellent and the book is read in one breath.  Much puts into place. <br><br><h5>  Round table ‚ÄúWeb standards vs.  Rich Internet Applications ‚Äù- Vadim Makeev, Nikita Seletsky </h5><br>  Leading against the hall.  Interesting thoughts from one side and the other.  But flush all the same, most do not care.  But everyone agrees that it can be used if cooked with straight hands. <br>  Will he leave so quickly.  In my opinion not.  My past place of work was the company engaged in the development of gambling on flash.  Developing a working prototype game with graphics took about a week.  How much the same site would have occupied on the CTML5 is difficult and imagining.  And if you need to change the graphics?  In HTML you will shoot yourself.  For the mobile version where the flash does not work, you can make an application for the desired platform. <br><br>  In America, with Rich Internet Applications, everything seems to be very good too.  According to the podcasts of Buda, while there is a good growth trend of this type of applications.  Conferences and master classes on Flex and the number of people for them are not small.  But this is just what I see now, the picture may be quite different. <br><br>  We will wait for the video conference.  Details I think will be on the conference site. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/94384/">https://habr.com/ru/post/94384/</a></p>
