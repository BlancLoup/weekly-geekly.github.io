I live a beautiful bright life, but I just can‚Äôt create a family.  No matter how much I look around, I see everywhere either beautiful pompous balabolks, or cleverly terrifying muffles.  Well, the rest of the gray mouse, which is now the majority, I just are not interested.  How can I find a beautiful and intelligent girl that I really like? <br>  - I see that your aspiration is great.  I will help you, but I will need to reflect on the answer.  Come to me tomorrow night. <br><br>  At this, they said goodbye and the next evening this man came to Teacher's home.

      - Now I will brew tea, but while I prepare the water, sit back.  We will have something to talk about. <br>  - Thank you teacher.  Even just being with you in the same house is a great honor for me. <br>  - Maybe you will tell me a few stories about women with whom he was familiar? <br><br>  And the student began a story about his very first love.  When he finished, it was dusk outside.  Teacher did not say a word in all this time - he only nodded his head thoughtfully several times. <br><br>  - You told a very interesting story.  But today I can not answer your question.  Go home and come tomorrow at the same time. <br><br>  The merchant went to the Master six times and repeated it six times.  He told him about his intercourse with young and mature women, poor and rich, smart and simple, beautiful and inconspicuous, but this did not change anything - Teacher thanked each time for an interesting story and offered to stop by again.  The student‚Äôs surprise had no limits, but on the seventh day the traditional order was broken immediately after the end of the next story. <br><br>  - I liked this story the most!  By the way, tell me, which tea did you like best? <br>  - To be honest, I was not at all here for tea - I am looking for an answer to my question.  As I recall, every time we drank green tea.  What do you have in mind? <br><br>  - Why are you in such a hurry?  Breathe in the scent and enjoy it.  Drink slowly, let yourself feel all the variety of subtle nuances of taste.  If you listen carefully to your feelings, you will understand that one tea gives you clarity of thinking, another gives you a feeling of lightness, the third calms, and the fourth invigorates.  To notice this, you only need to give it enough time and attention.  In total, during our meetings, I brewed seven different varieties of tea.  Will you drink my tea tomorrow night? <br><br>  There was a long pause, and the student, in an unexpectedly low and slow voice, said: ‚ÄúThank you for the invitation, Master.‚Äù  Now this is not necessary.  You answered my question. <br><br>  After that, he bowed low and said goodbye to Master forever. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/50822/">https://habr.com/ru/post/50822/</a></p>
