In this article, we propose to talk about the drink itself, more precisely, about how to prepare it. <br><br>  Actually, there are a lot of recipes and ways to make coffee.  In everyday life, an ordinary person uses 1-2 methods and 2-3 prescriptions, rarely more.  Devices for cooking at the same time can be both the simplest (jazz) and advanced in technology.  Well, since we are all geeks, let's estimate in this material what a coffee maker for geeks could be.  In the continuation - a selection of smart devices that can make coffee. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Coffee maker TimeCup CM-620 </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ccc/be6/495/cccbe64956102429ac0d9f9ea6855295.jpg" alt="image">

      First we propose to evaluate the high-tech Turk (or cezve - depending on who prefers the name).  She herself is made of high-temperature ceramics.  This material does not enter into any chemical interaction with water or other substances and does not emit harmful substances. <br><br>  You do not need to put a Turk on the fire.  Instead, it is necessary to use a film-type heating element.  It is located inside the case. <br><br>  Coffee simply cannot escape from the Turks because of the abundance of various kinds of sensors and sensors.  As soon as some detector detects an increase in the water level to a certain point, the power supply to the heater immediately stops.  There are really a lot of sensors, and there is even a volume foam sensor. <br><br>  On the case of the device there is a control panel with touch buttons and LED indicators.  In the plastic handle is placed a digital indicator that performs the function of a timer.  It also displays the temperature of the drink. <br><br>  In order to start making coffee, you just need to press the "Start" button and then you can continue to go about your business.  Is coffee ready?  Hi-tech Turk will report this with a sound signal. <br><br>  In Russia, you can buy TimeCup CM-620 <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/kofevarka-timecup-cm-620/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dhi_kofevar">from us</a> .  The device itself can not be called too common, but it finds its buyer. <br><br><h3>  Philips Saeco Granbaristo </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/306/52f/778/30652f77890f7b1296545c51ff0b4c7e.jpg"><br><br>  This is a complete coffee machine with a variety of functions.  It was developed by Philips, and it seems that the company's engineers did not work in vain.  With this device, coffee lovers can make almost any coffee drink.  There are 5 adjustable grind settings at once.  Ceramic millstones will not allow overheating of the beans, so that coffee will not have a burnt taste, which often upsets gourmets. <br><br>  In this coffee maker is also a powerful boiler, it works according to the Thermospeed technology.  All this together represents a system that allows you to quickly prepare a coffee drink. <br><br>  And, by the way, the system is compatible with iOS and Android devices.  Download the program on a tablet or phone and now - we can already prepare one of the many coffee drinks remotely.  When you wake up, you can order yourself a cup of delicious cappuccino, and only get up when the drink is ready. <br><br>  Favorite coffee recipe can be stored in the memory of the machine and cook at any time. <br><br>  Another interesting feature is the ‚Äúorder queue‚Äù, which allows any guest using a tablet PC to get their own drink, which this guest prefers. <br><br><h3>  Portable coffee machine Wacaco MiniPresso GR </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a4f/46e/360/a4f46e3609502529f3697d7e4439afe5.jpg"><br><br>  And this is a portable coffee maker, which is designed so that any tourist or traveler, no matter where he is, could drink coffee in the morning (or at any other time of day).  The coffee maker will fit in any backpack or bag - there are no problems with that.  The height of the capsule pill thermos is only 17.5 centimeters.  For this, a cup of coffee is not needed; instead, the owner can use the lid of the flask itself.  Inside the device - a container for falling asleep ground coffee. <br><br>  An interesting point: this system simply cannot heat the water, it is necessary to pour boiling water into it.  It is poured into the lower flask, the coffee is poured into the container, the machine is assembled and ... Yes, I almost forgot, to make coffee, you need to turn the device and press the pump button - thanks to it, the pressure rises to 9 atmospheres. <br><br>  Different number of clicks on the pump allows you to get different coffee drinks.  Clicked 18 times?  Got an espresso.  28 times?  Double espresso.  13 clicks?  Try this delicious ristretto. <br><br>  We ourselves like the coffee maker - we sometimes take it on business trips and regular <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MadrobotsRussia/videos/496720573831590/">walks around the city</a> or in nature.  Unfortunately, so far it is not for sale in Russia, but in the near future we plan to launch sales. <br><br><h3>  Behmor Coffee Maker </h3><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3HaoTkc3QY0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  And this is another coffee maker that helps to make coffee at any time of the day.  She, like the Philips coffee machine, supports control from a smartphone or tablet.  So here you can cook a snack without getting up from the sofa or chair. <br><br>  The coffee maker is not very large, the diameter of the base is 23 centimeters, the height is 40. The main control source is a button with a LED.  The color of the LED will tell you about the readiness of the drink. <br><br>  Up to 4.6 and 8 cups of coffee can be poured into the water tank.  Moreover, there is a wetting function, which, according to gourmets, improves the taste of coffee. <br><br>  <b>Specifications</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Type: Drip </li><li>  Diameter of a basis: 230 mm </li><li>  Tank capacity: 1.1 liters of water </li><li>  Container capacity: 150 g of ground coffee </li><li>  Material: aluminum, stainless steel </li><li>  Timer: yes </li><li>  Behmor app update: yes </li><li>  Wi-Fi support: yes </li><li>  Dimensions: 305 x 406 x 262 mm </li><li>  Weight: 4 kg </li></ul><br>  You can buy Behmor coffee maker in the Russian Federation in <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/behmor-connected-temperature-control-coffee-maker/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dhi_kofevar">our store</a> . <br><br><h3>  Smarter Coffee Machine </h3><br>  Another smart coffee machine with built-in coffee grinder.  This device is heard as "manual" commands, and remote control from the planet or phone.  Using a mobile application (iOS and Android), you can choose the size of grinding, setting the strength of your drink at the same time. <br><br>  The machine can be programmed to make coffee at a specific time.  Just imagine - you get up in the morning, and the smell of freshly brewed coffee is already spreading through the apartment.  There are several programs in the application, including Alarm Clock and Welcome Home, not to mention others. <br><br>  Of course, a portable machine can not be called, but the developers did not seek to make it so.  It is suitable for both home and office. <br><br><h3>  Coffee maker with integrated coffee grinder REDMOND SkyCoffee M1505S </h3><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0pEKhXeXhak" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Another coffee maker from a reputable manufacturer.  It also has a built-in coffee grinder, which can not but rejoice.  It supports Ready for Sky's proprietary control technology, which implies remote operation via Bluetooth. <br><br>  The REDMOND SkyCoffee M1505S coffee maker is controlled using Android or iOS applications (OS versions starting from Android 4.3 Jelly Bean or iOS 7 are supported, respectively).  The Ready For Sky app can be downloaded to your smartphone from the Play Market or the Apple Store. <br><br>  The capacity of the reservoir here is about 500 ml, so if you drink coffee in small portions, this will be enough for 1-3 days. <br><br>  If you want to try making delicious coffee without getting out of bed, then you should buy a <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/kofevarka-so-vstroennoy-kofemolkoy-redmond-skycoffee-m1505s%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dhi_kofevar">REDMOND SkyCoffee M1505S</a> coffee maker. <br><br><h3>  Bonaverde - a coffee maker that promises to make a revolution </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/316/beb/225/316beb2254b5d2f0cf20a78982a79671.jpg"><br><br>  A startup from Berlin, Bonaverde, for three years, promises to revolutionize the world of the coffee industry.  As a tool for the implementation of such a revolution, the startup offers its own coffee maker, which knows how to fry grains, grind them and make coffee. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lsAhk1E3pJY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  According to the developers, this device significantly reduces the path that coffee travels from the manufacturer to the buyer.  As a result, the grain can be purchased directly from the farmer, and not to go through the whole chain of intermediaries and transportation.  Coffee lovers with the help of Bonaverde can independently choose suppliers. <br><br>  The developers of the device state that it takes only 12 minutes from the moment of filling the green grains until the exit of the cup of flavored drink. <br><br>  The project team works with a large number of coffee producers around the world, as well as with potential investors who donate funds for the project.  Coffee lovers with help <br><br>  <b>In order to make the coffee more delicious</b> , we recommend using mineral water (without gas), or filtered water.  In addition, in order to get a richer taste of the drink, we recommend buying coffee beans, plus a coffee grinder.  Ground coffee from the store is good, but a more delicious drink will come out if you grind the coffee just before making it. <br><br>  Now the production of smart coffee makers are engaged in well-known large companies, and small startups.  The most interesting thing is that creating successful devices that are in demand among geeks can be done by both.  In this compilation we tried to indicate the most noticeable devices that we like ourselves.  If you can recommend other coffee makers - really look forward to this information in the comments. <br><br><hr><br>  We remind you that for all our readers there is a promotional code GEEK, giving a 5 percent discount on any product from <a href="http://madrobots.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dhi_kofevar">the Madrobots store</a> .  You can pass this code to your friends, acquaintances and relatives - this is only welcome! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/399525/">https://habr.com/ru/post/399525/</a></p>
