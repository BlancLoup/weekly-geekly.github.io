  <section class="page js-page"><h1>IDETools 9.2 and Resharper 4.5 for taste and color</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <b>UPDATED</b> <br>  I recently wrote about plugins for Visual Studio from DevExpress.  As I promised, at the end of the IDETools trial, I installed Resharper 4.5 trial.  Having worked a week with the product from JetBrains, I can give a couple of comments about the pros and cons. <br><br><img src="http://www.devexpress.com/Products/Visual_Studio_Add-in/CodeRushX/i/circle-scheme.png">  <font color="gray"><b>VS</b></font> <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/50a/a13/d7d/50aa13d7d98a520bb9cee15c655bdb2e.jpg" width="150"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Advantages of Resharper 4.5: </h4><br><ul><li>  I would like to immediately note that R # works much faster (without enabling the check option of the entire solution).  This is most likely due to the cache that Resharper stores in the project folder. </li><li>  As many here said - intellisense is at a higher level than Refactor! .. I made a conclusion and drove out the project verified by IDETools in R # - there were a couple of places where R # issued warnings and wishes (besides naming policy, which doesn‚Äôt suit me need to change defaults). </li><li>  Having experience with intelliJ and JBuilder R # I was more intuitive and easy to use, without having to watch tutorials and read hints. </li><li>  I was pleased to be able to ignore something which comments with #pragma blocks.  Suppose <em>Assignmenet in conditional statement is</em> often a mistake, but sometimes it is still a conscious choice. </li><li>  Another good point - when renaming or creating a variable / function, the options for the names offered by the program suited me 80% of the time, and in IDETools only 20%. </li><li>  More understandable hints (lookups) to functions </li><li>  Handles comments and summary, checking the variable names specified in them and visually highlighting the semantic blocks (note, todo) </li></ul><br><br><h4>  So these are the flaws that caught my eye when comparing with IDETools (CRx): </h4><br><ul><li>  The icon with the R # options appears at the beginning of the line, which is not very convenient compared to the ready dropdown in the right place at DevExpress </li><li>  No normal menu integration.  One that would allow to perform actions in two clicks and automatically adjust the menu on the right button, focusing on the position of the cursor.  This is missing after the transition from IDETools </li><li>  DevExpress made a more visual system that, when refactored, shows with arrows and colors what changes will be made, which is very good when you want to use some function for the first time or to evaluate whether it is worth doing something </li><li>  As I mentioned - CodeRush is almost out of competition.  There is no possibility to write a line in two or three keystrokes in R #.  Although the normal handling of CodeRush requires learning shortcuts. <br>  <i>Initially, there are more ready-made templates in CodeRush, but the work with templates and writing code goes faster.</i>  <i>Unlike Resharper, templates are activated from 1-3 letters (and in accordance with the code section shortcuts act differently: pressing f + space in the condition or near the boolean will give out not for, but false) Let's say the same foreach [Tab] in CodeRush will be fr + space, if there is a suitable variable in the buffer then an enumerator will be made automatically and autocomplete will also output only what is in scope and enumerable.</i>  <i>Well, you can add convenient navigation through the code to the pluses - a tab for quick return, jumping on a variable (pressing Tab on a variable will take you to the next place to use it), navigating on camelCase (moving the cursor to the next big letter in the name of a variable or class) etc.</i> <br></li><li>  There are more options for customization and customization in IDETools, not to mention third-party plugins and the easy possibility of writing your own add-ons for DXCore </li><li>  For some reason, I did not find in Resharper the possibility to choose where to put a new variable / function.  I don‚Äôt like that in one click I cannot make a global constant out of a variable or shove a string into a resource </li><li>  Fewer optimization options for string variables.  Unlike R #, selecting the block in IDETools, where data is added to the string several times (say in a loop), you will get the option to replace the string with a StringBuilder with one click.  And of course, checking the lines for null or "" (or both) is automatically suggested to be replaced by string.IsNullOrEmpty (of course, given the structure of the condition itself, you will automatically be added! If necessary).  By the way, you can make a constant (parameter / variable) from the value, and every time the same value is found in the code (scope is important), you will be prompted to replace it with the previously created constant. <br></li><li>  R # increasingly offers point solutions.  Suppose Remove Redundant Qualifier in R # removes it only at the selected location, and IDETools will go through the entire code, where the same namespace qualifier is too specified. <br></li></ul><br><h4>  Total: </h4><br>  My conclusion - both products are worthy of attention.  R # is easier to use in the early stages, and CodeRush is more efficient when used correctly.  Resharper's scent is better, but in IDETools it is nicer (hints and markings in the right places).  Still, R # is an alternative to Refactor! And it has almost no CodeRush functions.  You can even "make friends" with each other.  However, there will be no real benefit from this if you do not purchase paid (full) versions of programs.  Since what is missing R # in the free version of CodeRush is simply not there.

      <br>
      By the way, both plugins do not understand that using (SqlConnection ....) should be closed after the execution of commands, and not immediately after Open (); <br><br>  PS: It is worth mentioning that in IDETools there are also freeware plug-ins, so you can install the trial and continue to use the free part after the trial period of pro plug-ins.  Well and of course the price of R # is 30% higher than the equivalent from DevExpress. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/72466/">https://habr.com/ru/post/72466/</a></p>
