The result of <a href="http://adaptive.stepik.org/">Stepik Contest</a> will be a unique online learning system based on personal recommendations to students.  Winners of the competition will receive cash prizes of up to $ 10K. <br><br> <a href="http://adaptive.stepik.org/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4c1/9fe/962/4c19fe96291544838af6e34a62f36288.jpeg"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><cut text="  "><br>  In 2015, the Stepik team began developing an <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/stepic/blog/302702/">adaptive referral system</a> , the purpose of which is to select educational content and tasks individually for each student, based on their level of knowledge and training, and advise them to study only what is important at a particular stage of study.  The first prototypes of adaptive courses appeared in 2016: these are two courses on teaching the Python programming language - in <a href="https://stepik.org/431">Russian</a> and <a href="https://stepik.org/568">English</a> . <br><br>  For further development and testing of an adaptive system, an extensive knowledge base is needed, which we trust to create the best teachers, experts, and also experienced Stepik students.  It seemed to us that the format of the competition is very suitable for solving this problem: the opportunity to win cash prizes and take part in shaping the future of IT education - what are unworthy goals?

    <h3>  The competition is held in six nominations: </h3><br><ul><li>  Theoretical Computer Science </li><li>  Applied Computer Science </li><li>  Data science </li><li>  Python </li><li>  Java </li><li>  Javascript </li></ul><br><h3>  What should be done? </h3><br>  Choose a topic for yourself within one of the contest nominations and create 20+ tasks and a few theoretical lessons, revealing the topic.  All this needs to be arranged in the form of a course on the Stepik platform and send us a link.  Feature of the competition: all materials are accepted only <b>in English</b> . <br><br>  And now we will answer the most popular questions and reveal the specific details of the competition. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#32CD32">1) What is the timeline?</font> </h4><br>  Applications are accepted until February 11, 2017, which means there are two months to create lessons.  Then, in March-April, all incoming materials are evaluated and the winners are announced. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#32CD32">2) Copyright</font> </h4><br>  The copyright remains for the authors of the tasks and theoretical lessons, all materials created for the competition on the Stepik platform will be licensed for free use under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution ‚Äì ShareAlike 4.0 license (as is the case with other open courses on the platform). <br><br><h4>  <font color="#32CD32">3) In what format is it necessary to make educational content?</font> </h4> <a href="http://adaptive.stepik.org/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8a8/896/363/8a8896363940413d8cfbaaf16824f284.png"></a> <br>  Theoretical lessons can contain any type of material: it can be recorded video, written notes and extracts from documentation, etc. <br><br>  The tasks are a bit more complicated: since the training will be adaptive (that is, the system will advise the student on educational content, based on his knowledge) in one lesson you will need to collect tasks of one complexity, at least one task in one lesson. <br><br>  We also ask you to mark all created materials with special topics (tags).  It is important to connect all the lessons created on the platform and help users navigate through them.  A more detailed description can be found in a special article in our help center: <a href="https://goo.gl/HHNgwc">Stepik.help</a> . <br><br><h4>  <font color="#32CD32">4) Who and how will choose the winners?</font> </h4><br>  All lessons created within the framework of the competition will be handed over to students for evaluation by Stepik (and everyone who wishes).  Evaluation will occur by grading each lesson (likes and dislikes), and we will calculate the difference between them and take into account the percentage of the number of views of this lesson.  Please note that the competition allows you to create more than 20 lessons with tasks, so for an honest assessment we will take the 20 best lessons from each author. <br><br>  Special nominations will be selected using the adaptive system for Stepik's internal metrics.  For authors, it is important to know what is good when: <br><br><ul><li>  students do not leave the whole course, only after seeing your task, </li><li>  there are not a large number of people who, at the sight of a task, say that it is too complex or too simple, </li><li>  most people fail to solve it at the first attempt. </li></ul><br><h4>  <font color="#32CD32">5) What prizes can be won in the competition?</font> </h4><br>  The competition provides several cash prizes: $ 10,000 for the 1st place, $ 5,000 for the 2nd and $ 2,000 for the places from the 3rd to the 5th.  We also announce special nominations: $ 2,000 each for the best lessons in each of the six areas of the competition. <br><br><h3>  Finally </h3><br>  More information about the competition can be found <a href="http://adaptive.stepik.org/">on the competition website</a> .  Do not forget to tell your friends, acquaintances and experts in the above areas about our initiative. <br>  Looking forward to your requests and questions. <br><br>  Team Stepik. </cut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/317062/">https://habr.com/ru/post/317062/</a></p>
