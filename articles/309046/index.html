At that time, few people understood what it was about, but this document changed the world forever.  Blockchain projects inspired by Satoshi‚Äôs original experiment called ‚ÄúBitcoin‚Äù began to appear everywhere regularly.  Most of these projects are just Bitcoin clones with a few changes to the original Bitcoin protocol.  Some of these projects have succeeded in becoming successful, but most have failed.  The existence of such experiments should be considered as a very healthy aspect of the existence of a cryptocurrency ecosystem.  The reason is that the more competing projects that offer services based on the blockchain are created, the more they will be able to become successful. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I have been watching the cryptocurrency industry since the beginning of 2013 and have seen many ups and downs.  I saw the rise and then the disappearance of such a currency as Paycoin or one such as Auroracoin (Icelandic alternative to Bitcoin and the Icelandic krone), which also proved to be unviable.  After observing these wildly promoted projects, which many would call created exclusively for the ‚Äúpump and dump‚Äù trade, I became very wary of this industry of deception and the words of the crowd, who asserted that, they say, a new coin appeared that better than everyone else.  Carefulness makes it much easier to discover something innovative and avoid cheating.  In search of a truly innovative cryptocurrency, I stopped at <a href="https://www.dash.org/ru/">Dash</a> , and then I will explain why. <br><br>  The first thing you will hear: "Dash is a private cryptocurrency that allows you to make instant payments."  Sounds interesting, right?  This is what initially attracted me, but this is not exactly the reason why Dash remains attractive for me.  The best feature of Dash (in my opinion) is the decentralized management / budgeting system.

      This system allows Masternod owners (full nodes with 1.000 DASH collateral) to vote on important issues and budget proposals, which, if adopted, are funded directly from the blockchain.  Yes, it is, right from the blockchain!  This is achieved by distributing the reward for new assembly between the miners (45%), masterno operators (45%) and financing the budget proposal (10%).  This system is the first of its kind, it is also called the ‚ÄúSystem of decentralized control using the blockchain‚Äù.  It is this system that makes Dash a blockchain, which cannot be stopped, and I will explain why, since this magic can be understood by not everyone. <br><br>  I watched this system of decentralized management / budgeting since its inception and how much I saw!  10% reward per unit per month is approximately 7.450 DASH.  1 DASH at the time of the introduction of this system cost a little more than $ 2, that is, the entire monthly budget of Dash was about $ 15,000.  Fifteen thousand dollars a month, at the time it was like some kind of holiday, Christmas, which comes every month.  The project managed to do a lot for this money, for example, to purchase the dash.org domain ($ 20,000), to finance the participation of the development team in the leading blockchain conferences, etc.  Looking back at the budgeting system at the early stages, if even then it was like a monthly holiday, then I don‚Äôt even know what to call what we have now.  Due to the increase in market capitalization, Dash now costs $ 10.40, and at our disposal every month there is still the same amount of 7.450 DASH, so now we have $ 77.480 for such spending on a monthly basis in dollar terms.  With such an increase in budget size, Dash team managed to conclude a lot of useful deals, but one of the notable ones was the contract in which Gitguild (Ira Miller company) was hired, which introduced many different tools that can be used by third parties of blockchain applications for easy integration with Dash.  The results can be seen in projects such as Mycelium, Jaxx, Spectrocoin, Shakepay, Coinapult, Exodus, CryptoCapital, TigoCTM, Proton Mail and other projects with integrated support for Dash. <br><br>  The contract with Gitguild is just one of the many projects currently funded from the Dash blockchain.  We also financed the launch of Amanda B. Johnson's Youtube channel ‚ÄúDetails about Dash‚Äù, hired developers to help develop the next-generation Dash - Evolution system protocol, hired Wachsman PR as our PR representative, hired a team designers to design UI / UX Evolution, paid for accounting software, as well as office suite applications, which increased the productivity of our development team and allowed us to collaborate more efficiently,  -paying services of interpreters who translate our promotional material, the list goes on, but I think you've caught on. <br><br>  Now, having realized the above and what was done, you may think, wow, how cool it all is, but it is still just the tip of the iceberg.  If you are still reading this text, then let's take a closer look at this iceberg and see what lurks in the depths ... <br><br><h3>  Iceberg Underwater </h3><br>  If you grasped the above information, you should have realized that with the further growth of the Dash rate in our monthly budget, more funds appear (in dollar terms) to finance various new offers.  Now let's think about it a bit and imagine the prospects opening up.  If the Dash market capitalization were at the current level of Litecoin, then we would have a budget of about $ 195,300 per month for expenses that contribute to our further growth.  If our market capitalization were at the current level of Ethereum, then for monthly expenses for continued growth we would have $ 1,133,300, and if it was at the Bitcoin level, then it would be just some kind of holiday ($ 10,390. 000 per month). <br><br>  With such a weighty additional budget, a logical question emerges: how can you spend such money and still get profit from it?  Fortunately, there are many ways to do this, I will now explain a couple, after which you will be able to draw your own conclusions and reinforce the opinion that Dash is a blockchain that cannot be stopped. <br><br>  However, before proceeding to this, it is important to understand that it is the owners of Masternod Dash that are the driving force in making decisions, and also receive a reward for performing useful functions for the network (about 10% of their 1000 DASH per year).  Now that we‚Äôve figured out what‚Äôs what, let's delve into some of the potential future costs. <br><br><h3>  Dash Acquisitions / Strategic Investments </h3><br>  With an increase in the size of the monthly budget (remember that I count on great growth), the Dash project can begin to consider acquiring other companies offering blockchain services that would act as third parties and make strategic investments in some of them.  For example, if a company like Bitpay needed funding, we could strategically invest in them.  Such investments could benefit Dash for a number of reasons, first of all it means that Dash can include in the condition of the transaction the point according to which Bitpay integrates Dash into its network and secondly, this means that any profit Bitpay receives can then be sent back to the Masternode network, additionally increasing the profits of this network (Masternods are the driving force for making decisions). <br><br>  Another example is what the Kraken cryptocurrency exchange did with some smaller exchanges.  Kraken has acquired these small exchanges both to quickly resolve issues in various jurisdictions, and to increase its customer base.  Acquisition of the exchange can not be considered the best option for Dash, because it will not bring any significant income, except for the profit from the auction, which can then be sent back to the Masternod network. <br><br>  The best option for the acquisition would be the acquisition of Circle payment processing companies.  Imagine buying an application to make payments, and then switching the server side of this application instead of the Bitcoin network to work in the Dash network.  Switching to the Dash network instead of Bitcoin can even be carried out as a condition of strategic investment, without an acquisition (which would be cheaper). <br><br><h3>  Marketing </h3><br>  Imagine if Bitcoin had a monthly budget for marketing, it could finance huge informational Bitcoin campaigns and actually get some support from the mass market due to this.  But Bitcoin can not do this, but Dash can and will.  You can do without examples - you understand what this is about. <br><br><h3>  Deploying Dash ATMs worldwide </h3><br>  Dash has the ability to increase the number of access points to its payment network by acquiring and deploying a worldwide network of Dash ATMs.  Hell, he could even acquire Lamassu and make his own Dash ATM.  By allocating part of the monthly budget for servicing Dash ATMs, they can be placed around the world and make the payment network more useful and accessible.  By setting a small fee for using these ATMs, Dash could then return the profits from these investments to the masters of the masters. <br><br><h3>  Opening call centers and physical branches </h3><br>  Another way to make Dash closer to users is to allocate a portion of the monthly budget to finance call centers and physical branches of Dash.  This initiative will be aimed at attracting new customers to the project and retaining existing customers.  In fact, this will allow end users to make a more comfortable transition to Dash, since they will be able to get all the necessary information that they need to work with this currency. <br><br><h3>  Conclusion </h3><br>  Remember, when you are considering the latest, at first glance, the coolest blockchain projects - you should ask a couple of questions.  Does this blockchain finance its development?  Does he have a well-built management system?  If the answer is ‚Äúno‚Äù to any of these questions, then such a project should be ignored, as there is no continuous blockchain-business process in this project.  It took me 3.5 years to discover a project with a blockchain that cannot be stopped - and I assure you that as soon as you understand the essence of the <b><a href="https://www.dash.org/ru/">Dash</a></b> project, life will become much more fun! <br><br>  The following video inspired the author to write this article (the translator inspired it): Interview with Dash team members: Evan, Daniel, Robert, Ryan and Holger answer your questions |  ‚ÄúDetails about DASH‚Äù: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/4r4njjPP4sM%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiaBvW1cs8Ix0F2SRVptFmt1MqF1g" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Video - with Russian subtitles (included in the settings of YouTube). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/309046/">https://habr.com/ru/post/309046/</a></p>
