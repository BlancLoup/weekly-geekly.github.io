      <b>Todolist:</b> <br>  1. <s><i>Make exercises.</i></s> <br>  2. <s><i>Learn to use habrakat.</i></s>  )) <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Simple charging on all muscle groups</b> <br><br>  <i>Full set of exercises for busy people</i> <br><br>  This universal complex includes exercises for all muscle groups.  It will suit both beginners and trained individuals.  Combine this exercise with stretching for different muscles and perform daily.  Within a few weeks you will notice the difference, and in two or three months the muscles will become much stronger and more prominent.  It is advisable to supplement the complex with aerobic workouts, which are beneficial for the cardiovascular system and increase muscle tone.  Choose an activity you like: swimming, aerobics or gymnastics, jogging or training on simulators, etc. <br><br>  This exercise will help improve the tone of all muscle groups.  It does not take much time: in addition to a two-minute warm-up, one exercise cycle (approach) takes 8 minutes, respectively, 2 approaches - 16 minutes, and 3 approaches - 24 minutes.  Complete the exercises with a simple five-minute stretch of all muscle groups. <br>  Recommendations for the exercise: <br><br>  * Do not exercise on a full stomach. <br>  * To practice, choose a flat solid horizontal surface (preferably a floor), if necessary, lay a blanket or rug on top.  Ensure that the surface is not cold or slippery. <br>  * Before exercising, be sure to warm up your muscles with a small workout for 3-5 minutes.  You can work out on a cardiovascular machine at the lowest speed (weak level).  This will help prepare the muscles for work, avoid sprains and injuries. <br>  * Maintain proper posture - this will increase the effectiveness of the exercises. <br>  * Perform each exercise carefully and carefully. <br>  * Repeat each exercise 8-10 times.  If the habit is hard, reduce the number of repetitions. <br>  * Begin with one approach - one cycle of exercises with 8-10 repetitions.  Over time, increase the number of approaches to 2, and then to 3, as the strength and endurance of the muscles increase.  The interval between approaches should be short (no more than 30 seconds). <br>  * After a workout, stretch all muscles to help avoid pain and increase flexibility. <br><br>  <u><i>Set of exercises</i></u> <br><br>  <i>Warm up</i> <br><br>  * Start with circular sweeps with your hands, after twenty seconds, start marching in place, gradually increasing your speed, raising your knees and waving your arms harder.  Perform within two minutes. <br>  * Spread your legs and place your hands on your hips.  Rotate your hips for a minute, first clockwise and then against. <br><br>  <i>Squats</i> <br><br>  Exercise for hips and buttocks <br><br>  Starting position: standing, legs but width of shoulders. <br><br>  Fulfillment: bend your knees until your hips make an angle of about 45 degrees to the floor.  For balance, stretch your arms forward.  Slowly return to the starting position. <br><br>  Complicated version: in a few weeks, when the muscles become stronger, try to squat deeper (this is more difficult), but not until the end - so that the hips are parallel to the floor. <br><br>  <i>Swing legs</i> <br><br>  Exercise for hips and buttocks <br><br>  Starting position: standing, feet shoulder-width apart, right arm at the hip.  If desired, lean your left hand on the table or back of a chair. <br><br>  Fulfillment: take your right foot forward, touching the floor with an elongated toe.  Perform wide circular movements with your right foot: forward / sideways / backward / to the starting position.  Sock lightly touches the floor.  Do 8-10 reps with your right foot, and then swing your left foot. <br><br>  Complicated version: increase the load by wrapping the ankle with elastic bandages. <br><br>  <i>Tilts sideways</i> <br><br>  Exercise for oblique mice back and abdomen <br><br>  Starting position: standing, feet shoulder-width apart, left hand on the back of the head, in the right - a dumbbell or a weight of 1 kg. <br><br>  Execution: lean to the side, then slowly return to the starting position.  Make 8-10 tilts to the right, then repeat the tilts with a dumbbell in your left hand. <br><br>  Complicated version: gradually increase the weight of the dumbbell. <br><br>  <i>Straight torsion</i> <br><br>  Exercise for the rectus abdominis muscle <br><br>  Starting position: supine, knees bent, feet flat on the floor, palms on the back of the head. <br><br>  Fulfillment: on the exhale, tear off the head and neck from the floor, lifting them a few centimeters.  While inhaling, slowly sink to the floor.  Be careful with neck pains. <br><br>  <i>Reverse twisting</i> <br><br>  Exercise for the transverse abdominal muscles <br><br>  Starting position: supine, knees bent, legs raised parallel to the floor, ankles crossed, palms on the back of the head. <br><br>  Fulfillment: while inhaling, tighten the abdominal muscles from the navel to the pubic bone.  As you exhale, pull your hips to your chest sharply, continuing to strain your muscles.  Slowly return to the starting position. <br><br>  Complicated version: slightly raise the shoulders so that they touch the knees each time. <br><br>  <i>Lateral twisting</i> <br><br>  Exercise for oblique mice belly and waist <br><br>  Starting position: supine, knees bent, legs raised parallel to the floor, ankles crossed, palms on the back of the head. <br><br>  Fulfillment: on the back, pull off the right shoulder from the floor and pull the elbow to the left knee.  Keep your buttocks in contact with the floor.  Slowly return to the starting position.  After making 8-10 repetitions with the rise of the right shoulder, perform repetitions for the left. <br><br>  Complicated version: gradually tighten the elbows closer and closer to the knees. <br><br>  <i>Basket</i> <br><br>  Exercise for the lower back <br><br>  Starting position: lying on the floor, face down, arms along the body, hands lying on the buttocks with the back side. <br><br>  Execution: exhaling, slowly raise your head and neck.  Look at the floor.  The palms should move down slightly.  Slowly return to the starting position. <br><br>  Complicated version: change the initial position: the right arm is extended forward, the left arm is bent, the brush is under the head.  Simultaneously with the lifting of the head and neck, raise the extended arm.  Perform 8-10 repetitions on each hand. <br><br>  <i>Push ups</i> <br><br>  Exercise for mouse chest and shoulders <br><br>  Starting position: standing on all fours, back straight, hips make a right angle with the floor, hands shoulder-width apart, fingers pointing forward. <br><br>  Execution: Slowly lower the chest as low as possible to the floor, then slowly return to the starting position. <br><br>  Complicated version: do the exercise by moving your arms and shoulders forward, crossing your ankles and straightening your legs.  Exercise caution with diseased joints. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.dieta.ru/fitness/simpleexercises/">Original</a> <br><br>  <b>UPDATE</b> All my pardon for the mushrooms, who was offended.
