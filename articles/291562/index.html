Its essence is to allow users to request removal of links to inaccurate, outdated (more than three years) or ‚Äúinformation that is distributed in violation of the law‚Äù. <br><br>  The amendments made to the State Duma on May 29 Vadim Dengin, Alexey Kazakov, Olga Kazakova and Leonid Kalashnikov.  For non-compliance with the requirements, companies are threatened with fines: up to 100 thousand rubles for an unmotivated refusal to remove links and up to 3 million rubles for non-execution of a court decision.  The search companies <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25AF%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2581">Yandex</a> , <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google">Google</a> and <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mail.Ru_Group">Mail.ru</a> believe that this will limit public interest in information. <br><br>  Yandex believes that innovations contradict Article <a href="http://main-law.ru/st29">29 of the</a> Constitution of the Russian Federation and Article 8 of the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD_%25C2%25AB%25D0%259E%25D0%25B1_%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D1%2584%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8,_%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D1%2584%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D1%2585_%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2585%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F%25D1%2585_%25D0%25B8_%25D0%25BE_%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D1%2589%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D1%2584%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8%25C2%25BB">Law</a> ‚ÄúOn Information‚Äù.

      From the text of the bill it follows that a search engine can be considered any Internet resource with the function of searching for information.  It also follows from the document that search engines must independently assess the accuracy, relevance and compliance with the legislation of information.  But, according to Yandex, they do not have sufficient competence for this. <br><br>  Representatives of the company also expressed concern that the pre-moderation of content "paralyzes the work of search engines and will allow unreasonably to bring search engine operators to justice." <br><br>  The Russian Association of Electronic Communications (RAEC) also <a href="http://raec.ru/times/detail/4236/">gave a</a> negative assessment of the bill. <br><br>  The focal point of the national domain of the Internet (CC) stresses the need to reimburse the costs of search engines to change the search algorithms in case of amendments.  The head of the legal department of the KC Sergey Kopylov found it difficult to estimate the costs necessary for such changes. <br><br>  On Thursday, "Megamind" <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/16384/">wrote</a> that the company <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rambler%26Co">Rambler &amp; Co</a> insist on the need to finalize the project.  External communications director Matvey Alekseev <a href="http://top.rbc.ru/technology_and_media/11/06/2015/557959a69a794769521832b2">told</a> RBC that the holding does not understand why a citizen may demand that reliable information be deleted after three years have passed since it appeared.  The company also believes that it is necessary to define the criteria for inaccurate information, which, according to the draft law, does not have a statute of limitations and can also be deleted at the request of the user. <br><br>  Last May, a European court ordered Google search engine to remove information about the sale of plaintiff Mario Gonzalez‚Äôs house for debts.  The decision does not imply the introduction of the ‚Äúright to oblivion‚Äù on a general basis, representatives of Yandex and Google emphasize.  We are talking about an individual consideration of each case and the need to observe a certain measure in limiting the public interest in access to information.  However, the Russian bill does not give search engines such an opportunity. <br><br>  On Friday, a meeting was held between representatives of Google, Yandex, Mail.ru Group, Rambler &amp; Co, Interfax and the Russian Association of Electronic Communications with Leonid Levin, head of the information policy committee.  ‚ÄúWe explained the technical features of the functioning of search engines, which require an indication of specific URLs with the placement of information.  Arguments about jurisdiction, overly broad definitions of information, references to which are to be deleted, and other legal and technical remarks were brought, ‚ÄùAnton Malginov, head of the legal department of Mail.ru Group, told Kommersant. <br><br>  Deputies are planning to adopt the amendments before the end of June.  Therefore, Internet companies must submit their comments and additions before June 17. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/291562/">https://habr.com/ru/post/291562/</a></p>
