The selection criteria were as follows: lightweight, compact, with good performance (so netbooks of all stripes disappear), and, preferably, a long battery life (~ 2: 30 previous laptop sometimes was not enough, and sometimes - at the most inopportune moment).  And yet - I didn‚Äôt want to take it with Vista pre-installed, but with pre-installed Win7 it would be a plus for me.

    <h2>  Selection </h2><br>  For a start, dry facts (all the options are listed, in bold - what I preferred): <table><tbody><tr><td>  operating system </td><td>  Windows 7 Home Premium 64bit </td></tr><tr><td>  CPU </td><td>  Core 2 Solo ULV SU3500 1.4GHz / <strong>Core 2 Duo SU7300 1.3GHz</strong> / Core 2 Duo SU9400 1.4 GHz </td></tr><tr><td>  RAM </td><td>  4096 (2x2048) MB DDR3 / <strong>3072 (2048 + 1024) MB DDR3</strong> </td></tr><tr><td>  Display, inches </td><td>  <strong>13.3 /</strong> 14/15.6 (models with a different screen have a different number - 4810 and 5810, respectively, about them just below) </td></tr><tr><td>  HDD </td><td>  <strong>250/500</strong> GB (5400 rpm) </td></tr><tr><td>  Video card </td><td>  Intel GMA 4500MHD / <strong>ATI Radeon HD 4330 512 MB</strong> </td></tr><tr><td>  Wireless interfaces </td><td>  <strong>WiFi, WiMax</strong> , Bluetooth </td></tr><tr><td>  Other </td><td>  USBx3, VGA (D-Sub), HDMI, digital audio output S / PDIF, LAN </td></tr><tr><td>  Any </td><td>  webcam 1.0 mpix, microphone, card reader 3 in 1, touchpad with multitouch </td></tr><tr><td>  Price </td><td>  21-29 thousand.  rub (21-41tys., if we consider the model with large diagonals) </td></tr></tbody></table>  Bundle here, as usual, defined by the manufacturer, so if in some points you find my choice strange, a possible explanation is this - there was no choice. <br>  The first thing you need to decide is the size of the diagonal.  Because  models with 14 ‚Äùand 15.6‚Äù screens have a built-in DVD-drive (which I absolutely do not need) and the weight is 0.4kg and 0.8kg more, then I chose 13.3 ‚Äù.  In addition, the screen resolution of all models is the same (1366 x 768).  13.3 ‚Äùversion weighs 1.6kg. <br>  Then, the processor.  The youngest processor in the line is single-core, whose times are already running out, so the older two remain.  The difference between them is about 3000r, whether it is worth it or not - everyone decides for himself. <br>  And finally, the video card.  If you sometimes wish to play, then you should look at a model with a discrete one (in general, there will be two video cards in such a laptop, you can switch them to save battery power). <br>  Everything else, according to my observations, is tied to the described components and their choice unambiguously determines what you get in the appendage.  The selected copy cost in ~ 25500r. <br><br><h2>  Using </h2><br><h3>  Appearance </h3><br>  I unpacked it, inside it turned out - the laptop itself, the instruction book, charging, the battery and all the junk.  He turned on, noticed that it works very quietly (with a large load it buzzes, but also quite quietly).  Around the screen there is a matte (look up!) Frame in which the prints are not visible, they are more noticeable around the touchpad, but they are also not noticeable (perhaps due to color).  This is how it looks in life: <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/038/92e/4d9/03892e4d99ef94303e5584c60eee974e.png"></a> <br><br><h3>  Battery. </h3><br>  On the laptop there is a power-on button, which makes the screen darker, disables the voracious discrete graphics card and so on.  In this mode, the laptop works from 6 (Wi-Fi, active surfing, etc.) to 10 (only Word is open) hours.  Without energy saving it works from 3.5 (modern 3D game) to 6 hours (the same surfing).  The numbers are approximate, only to give an opportunity to evaluate their order. <br><br><h3>  Performance. </h3><br>  Checked in Counter Strike Source, Team Fortress 2, Left 4 Dead 2. Resolution - native, 1366x768, all settings at minimum.  In CSS and L4D2, the laptop showed an acceptable level for me, in TF2, in places of clusters of players, fps sagged to ~ 18-20, which does not allow playing with comfort.  I will quote tsiferki for L4D2 (avg fps about 40, min per level - 16).  In CSS, the average fps is about 75, which is quite awesome. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/038/92e/4d9/03892e4d99ef94303e5584c60eee974e.png"></a> <br><br><h3>  Case and keyboard. </h3><br>  The keyboard is quite original, the button is a flat pad on the leg.  Everything is pressed normally, but with voice acting All the letters on the keyboard are white, they say that some of them may have problems (if you type blindly, this is unlikely to be a disadvantage).  The prints are noticeable well.  The case looks strong and high quality, does not creak and does not bend.  The cover is metallic, pleasantly cool to the touch, gets dirty, but not as glossy. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/038/92e/4d9/03892e4d99ef94303e5584c60eee974e.png"><br><br><h3>  Minuses. </h3><br>  They are controversial, but nonetheless. <br>  - I did not like the presence of x64 OS on a model with 3GB of memory (yes, you can expand to 8GB, but how many people will do this?). <br>  - The processor with a frequency of 1.3 GHz sometimes makes itself felt.  Building even a small project in Visual Studio is noticeably slower than on the desktop.  Well, this is the price for a long battery life ... <br><br><h3>  Comparison with alternatives. </h3><br>  Recently, ASUS UL50Vt and Acer 1810TZ reviews were skipped, and I'd add about TravelMate 8371G from myself.  So a couple of words about them. <br>  ASUS UL50Vt is more powerful, more expensive, harder, more, it seems to work longer and the whole is glossy. <br>  The 1810TZ is very similar, but, in addition to its smaller size and weight, it is decently weaker (processor SU4100 and only an integrated video card), and also has a plastic glossy cover! <br>  I didn‚Äôt hold TravelMate 8371G in my hands, but judging by the characteristics and appearance - a copy of the described laptop with the exception of the price (travelmate is more expensive by ~ 5k) and a <strong>matte</strong> screen.  It was not very important to me, but judging by the comments / polls, they mostly want them. <br>  UPD.  At the request of readers - a few more pictures from different angles: <br><br>  Cap: <br><img src="http://img2.pict.com/90/b7/4b/2880970/0/70544510.jpg" alt="Cap"><br><br>  Side view: <br><img src="http://img2.pict.com/b8/d7/71/2880875/0/img1614j.jpg" alt="Side view"><br><br><img src="http://img2.pict.com/33/48/ad/2880874/0/img1611q.jpg" alt="Side view"><br><br>  Keyboard: <br><img src="http://img2.pict.com/2e/cb/5f/2880906/0/img1592i.jpg" alt="Keyboard"><br><br>  UPD2.  View from the inserted battery.  The lid is folded to the maximum.  Sometimes this angle is not enough. <br><img src="http://img2.pict.com/41/1b/a0/2886709/0/img1615wr.jpg" alt="Side view"><br><br>  That's all, thank you for your attention!  ;) <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/84653/">https://habr.com/ru/post/84653/</a></p>
