  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Management Models: Situational Model</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/19518/">last article</a> I only superficially touched the situational model, and it may seem that this is not a model, but an ‚Äúurgent confusion‚Äù.  In fact, this is far from the case.  Situational model - 90% consists of prepared scenarios, it remains only to properly assemble them. <br><br>  Situations are different.  We all know this; last time I gave an example of a police station, but this time I will give an example of guard duty. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  What is guard duty? <br>  - Corporal Karasev, the post passed! <br>  - Private Kichman, accepted the post!

      Everything is simple, boring and monotonous.  But all for one.  For the sake of the event.  Private Kichman saw in the dark how lights in the forest shine on the opposite mountain.  According to the instructions, he wakes up his ‚Äúsecond‚Äù, shows him that they count the number of fires in the forest on the slope.  That they appreciate the situation.  Kichman sends the second officer into the tent to wake the officer - the situation is serious, they counted 43 fires, and even if four people each had one, that‚Äôs 172 ‚ÄúCzechs‚Äù. <br><br>  The officer accepts the only correct and appropriate instructions and all that he was taught the decision - to inform the headquarters and ask for reinforcements.  The headquarters is located at a position of just two hours of transition, and the APC passes it in 15 minutes. <br><br>  When the position is reinforced by the fighters who arrived and housed, which the officer promptly reports, a nasty noise is heard in the air and the forest on the opposite slope flashes with bright lights of explosions and the noise of falling trees - this is what Grad is working on from the headquarters.  Suppress before the attack - the same is the right decision. <br><br>  In the morning, a reconnaissance company arrives at the position and sets off on a slope to inspect the place, count the corpses and finish off the rest, who can be interrogated.  If you're lucky. <br><br>  So what did the solution to this situation look like with textbook letters? <br><ol><li>  In time to notice the change in the situation (to detect the situation) </li><li>  Assess the situation, complexity and danger of the situation. </li><li>  Take all measures so that the situation does not accept the development and deterioration of the situation (call for reinforcement) </li><li>  Solve the situation as simple as possible (without engaging in battle, apply Grad) </li><li>  Make sure that the situation does not happen again (send intelligence) </li></ol><br><br>  We are not responsible for the life and the border between Chechnya and Georgia.  We solve business situations.  Situations of fallen servers, sudden features and unexpected landing pages. <br><br>  This requires the same instructions, the same plan.  We have to monitor the server and are regularly interested in the plans of the business in order to immediately detect the "situation". <br><br>  We must properly classify and evaluate it.  Landing for a mobile audience?  Easy!  8 hours of layout, 2 - testing, 1 - to use the registration API. <br><br>  Dead HDD in RAID?  And here it is clear, you need to replace the dead. <br><br>  Has a bug come from a live system?  Yes, you need a buckder reinforcement.  Is there anyone free?  "On, keep the bug!" <br><br>  We must understand the complications of the situation.  Do not replace HDD - next time we lose data.  We incorrectly estimate time for a landing page - a business will lose this time, not us.  Bug fix Junior?  So wait for three more bugs in the evening and one more by the morning. <br><br>  We have to deal with the situation before their complication - I always have a backup HDD in the DC in a rack on the floor.  It is necessary to replace - I call my friend a datacenter and he changes it.  Of course, the baskets in the servers are numbered and the indicator blinks on the broken one - even a fool will not confuse.  For landings, there is always a blank, run-in and documented API for registrations - this does not allow the Landing layout to turn into the development of parts of the system. <br><br>  Unfortunately, I have very few other people's examples of successful situational management, but I do not want to boast myself.  If you have it - welcome in the comments, I will be very glad to hear your examples of success in this matter. <br><br>  Another standard situation is easy to find automatically, and also automatically repair.  This is a reservation, and adding space to a logical volume LVM machine, this is Hot Spare disks in the Raid. <br><br>  If you develop a list of standard situations and their solutions - your life and project life will become much easier, simpler and calmer.  After all, it is always easier to solve the ‚Äúhellish urgent‚Äù according to a proven plan, than to improvise on a drill, especially since sometimes granite comes across poorly drilled. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/294632/">https://habr.com/ru/post/294632/</a></p>
