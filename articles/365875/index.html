This event took place on July 17 in pavilion 322, having started at 18.00 and lasted until 6.00 (already on July 18).  According to the project of the organizers, the building plans to implement a technological space equipped with all the necessary equipment to create a working prototype in the field of the Internet of things, <b>microelectrical transport</b> and energy efficiency.  Actually, this institution is viewed in perspective from the perspective of the upcoming prototyping - the benefit is in September it is planned to equip the hackspace with the appropriate equipment.  In the meantime, I managed to admire the hackspace <s>with non-ferrous metals and blast furnaces</s> at the grand release stage. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fac/32d/8f2/fac32d8f251f441899545019e2ece0c5.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/450/8df/0cc/4508df0cc8cd436e9e21d81cb2c05843.jpg"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      So, grabbing a reflex camera with a bright fifty dollars and wearing a waistcoat- <s>isserman</s> , stuffed with two mirrorless cameras, a shooter and a few more gadgets, I rushed to the event. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aac/6cb/101/aac6cb101f5e4b5384f30456b4d30bfe.jpg"></div><br><br>  I managed to arrive shortly before the event, thanks to which I was able to capture the exposition with the existing equipment, until it was taken up by the giktolps. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/0BFOrhf3InA%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhih5Ske-IbcgcWykLTOjkMb-zCtcw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Basically there are now motley widescreen plotters and 3D printers.  I hope that by the autumn, CNC machines, high-precision welding machines, pipe benders, sheet bending machines and hydraulic presses will be delivered.  Although not the fact that the adherents of the Internet of things and energy efficiency share a similar desire for metalworking.  Well, let's hope for the development of the institution mainly in the direction of a <s>warm tube</s> hackspace, rather than a <s>glamorous casual</s> coworking. <br><br>  And currently, further plans have been voiced by inspired speeches by the organizers of the hackspace and high-ranking capital figures in the official part of the event. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/y1Q3R2kJDVU%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhggz1QS-dSMlC0c95g2eUyH7xqZSA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Further, the informal part followed, during which I was able to encounter a lot of interesting things.  For a start, I visited the technology showroom, where the cream of electric transport of our glorious default has gathered.  As it turned out, the country has already launched serial production of rather compact folding electric bicycles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3f7/a21/16c/3f7a2116c3464567b777e6d1770af96d.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fe7/7d5/a07/fe77d5a07f674862b3824986d72d77de.jpg"><br><br>  Regarding the production localization of the product, it was possible to achieve success mainly in the bicycle aspect, since  almost all cycling kits are made in domestic factories.  But the electric component is almost entirely ordered in heaven, but the targeted work on localizing the production of motor-wheels, controllers and battery assemblies is already underway. <br><br>  The electric transport product itself was able to capture in more detail at the open-air site, located in front of the building. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/bImco3t7qNY%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhe8KS_ijjDbRvF5Hv3M4wb6bZJ_A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Not without testdrayv this miracle of engineering. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/o1ILiQeZwJ8%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgT95iuLkkeCRRUMfeWQoE93Z4kYw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  In general, the gadget seemed quite ergonomic and easy.  At least, in comparison with my pig iron scooter rhino from China industry, which has a significantly shorter wheelbase and weighs a half and a half more.  A little embarrassed by the slight slip at the start (apparently, the controller was configured for heavier riders) and the lack of shock absorbers (although this factor greatly simplifies the design and greatly simplifies the product), the rest is very pleasant. <br><br>  In the hall of the building, in addition to the above described electric bike, a number of two-wheeled vehicles were still present, including gadgets of comrades who, on such a rainy day, got on their own electric and non-mechanical transport. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/4qaxzi4Okr0%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhrOYCWUwLp0oLRioaYbeTaDCjHmg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  And when I got to the second floor, it turned out that, in addition to electric transport, there were several other (also like domestic) gadgets at the event. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/08d/a91/ef7/08da91ef7ec643fe878e21455726f453.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b0a/772/89b/b0a77289b00348ccb7e250bdef75d216.jpg"><br><br>  A little later, I discovered that I am not the only one here who is <s>so unique</s> with an action camera.  Apparently, pretty soon it will become a trend to carry an action camera at such events ... Well, I hope the release of domestic action cameras is not far off. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/428/d0c/9a8/428d0c9a8b6f4faeb60217533eac4218.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1be/b4c/895/1beb4c895ac9489293d78fb571fcd636.jpg"><br><br>  When I reached the <s>third floor of the</s> observation deck, I suddenly began to bite my elbows on the occasion of not taking the telephoto lens with me.  Unfortunately, it turned out that at the event all the other owners of DSLRs were polls with Canon's, and for a short time there was simply no one to lend Nikon's telegraph. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8f5/8fb/e25/8f58fbe252424ae5a3b7b0aad1651356.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/998/0d6/f21/9980d6f2112d4369843a2e2165de75ef.jpg"><br><br>  In the meantime, the inhabitants of the upper floors were piloting micro-quadcopters, testdrayvs of several instances of the collapsible domestic electric cable were in full swing on the open-air site. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/faa/2a6/81e/faa2a681e4d44cbcaecba79d74b1b482.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f84/24b/782/f8424b78222c43a5a5f298b76c8ce4e6.jpg"><br><br>  During busy bike rides, from somewhere, electric vehicles from the heavens appeared on gyroboards, generously sharing them for test driving to the audience. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c8f/26c/f82/c8f26cf82aa54e24b4df017a794cecd1.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/903/88f/c50/90388fc506fc4ae8b30c1f8543f5ca16.jpg"><br><br>  One of the first volunteers in the test data of exotic gadgets were graceful girls: <br><br>  - Tall blonde <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/IXnVX3mOdg4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhCXD1xsLulh1DxeZLsbbDwlYtPJw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  - Colorful brunette <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/YNHiTq8A_-I%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhj-E5Vi3G60j01sVfgYw8KwKqTb-w" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  - And miniature brown hair <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/cv-x5PDVYLE%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhj7VYgUUA-ygBpUOFIG2US9gF_YEw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  A little later, a monowheel, a segway and a pair of scooters appeared on the site ... Meanwhile, a small improvised round table of electric vehicles led by Alexei, who was already prototyping his ultra-compact scooter project, was held in the showroom. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/gqp3ZBhEO1o%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhi6Hc6Iz5uuS_9p_13htgM2CmN6tw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  When the time was nearing midnight and it was starting to rain, most electric transport workers began to gradually go home. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/336/301/214/336301214e684356a3bf7cca489ca347.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/56f/31f/0e7/56f31f0e79ed4206aa6e56375fb749d9.jpg"><br><br>  And the exposition with the equipment and the second floor was still quite lively. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eff/969/e4b/eff969e4b6084ae881d9b818cd88e94a.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fc0/bca/072/fc0bca07215a44dda63431e6bea6cf4d.jpg"><br><br>  To my surprise, on the dance floor they didn‚Äôt play a heavy broom, so expected <s>for an institution with a similar name</s> ... But it would be rather harmonious, for example, to reflect on AC / DC music on AC brushless motors and direct current brushless motors, or to discuss on White Zombie the theme of the revival of the domestic real sector.  There was spinning (in principle, soulful) non-tensioned electronics, which made me very sleepy that day, also made me gradually gather towards the house. <br><br>  And in conclusion of the story, I would like to thank the organizers of this technological space for their titanic works and express hope for the further development of start-building in the real sector in the country. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/365875/">https://habr.com/ru/post/365875/</a></p>
