  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What happens in the IT labor market in the USA?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/172935/%3Freply_to%3D6007659">post about new rules for immigration in the United States</a> raised a rather interesting topic - the lack of qualified IT specialists in America.  This problem has always existed, but why exactly now it attracted the attention of the giants of industry? <br><br>  I have my own opinion on this subject, which I want to share.  These are not statistics, just observations and conclusions.  The action takes place in the Seattle area, 20 minutes from Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Expedia, etc. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The roots of the problem go back to the events of more than 10 years ago, when the collapse of dot-coms was raging in the US, IT companies collapsed like dominoes, people were dismissed by teams, wages were falling rapidly, and hundreds of resumes were sent to one open position in the first hour after publication . <br><br>  My colleague told me that he himself sent a decorated basket with cookies to the recruiter, where he put his resume - just to be noticed.

      Many dismissed quickly figured out the direction of the trend and went on to get real estate agent licenses and loan brokers, the need for which grew along with real estate prices at an alarming rate. <br><br>  It is also obvious that every year millions of high school graduates decide who they should be.  And if completed computer "geeks" chose a profession of 10 years, the overwhelming majority considers the subsequent employment and wages as decisive factors.  Of course, with that situation in the market, the thought was spinning in the young brain, ‚ÄúYou need a fig ?!‚Äù, and crowds of graduates joined the ranks of future financiers, doctors, lawyers, etc.  instead of learning programming. <br><br>  Then, over the next 5-7 years, the industry was at rest - qualified specialists found a stable job, moved away from shock, made a career and overgrown with benefits.  Most of them were willing to enter the labor market for a long time.  They were valued, raised wages and provided a relatively quiet life in the comfort zone. <br><br>  In the same period, the market exploded with new gadgets - the iPhone came out, and Android after it - new, interesting, mobile, unexplored!  Think for yourself how many people decided to try to write on them.  Two words - there were tasks that previously simply did not exist or were negligible. <br><br>  ABOUT!  So on this you can still earn?  The employer is sent to the forest, the young talent lives in cheap housing, and even mom and dad, Red Bull blows and pedals so that the keyboard smokes!  Many of them became employers themselves, who, of course, were looking for programmers to hire. <br><br>  An absolutely identical story happened with social networks - billions of Zuckerberg did not give rest to potential interns of Microsoft, and another large part of the market was bitten off by applications for social networks, and even new social networks. <br><br>  Here you can add the rapid development of Cloud Computing, which required more resources that were previously available on the market. <br><br>  So, what do we have after all this?  So to speak from the fields. <br><br>  Our company is going to rewrite the product from scratch.  Transition from .NET to Java / PHP / MySQL.  Do not ask me why, in a nutshell - a whim of top managers.  To do this, plan to hire twenty developers.  After three months of searching, hired by his own recruiter and the promised referral bonuses hired two developers.  Two people for three months of active searches - think about these numbers.  Moreover, the vacancies of managers were filled in a few days. <br><br>  Just talked to one of the programmers on this topic.  He knows a man of 10 suitable candidates, but three of them flew off to roam all kinds of Kilimanjaras / Antarctica, five responded that they don‚Äôt care about HR / Payroll programming in FIG, and two simply are very expensive.  And as far as I know, they hire for a salary&gt; $ 120K per year. <br><br>  Such are the thoughts that are confirmed by conversations with people from other companies, in particular Microsoft, Amazon, Expedia. <br><br>  The situation for employers is very sad.  At the same time, it is aggravated by public pressure on the government to return the work back to America. <br><br>  For programmers, on the contrary, everything looks in a rainbow of light. <br><br>  UPD: I asked the recruiter - the company has not yet made H1B visas and transfers. <br>  UPD2: The poll is a great reflection of the Pareto law! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/172983/">https://habr.com/ru/post/172983/</a></p>
