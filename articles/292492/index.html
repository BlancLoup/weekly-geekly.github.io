Street shops and shops are abandoned.  Cobwebs hanging on shelves and shelves.  Weeds grow from cracked floor.  And then it's all for demolition.  Everything will fall before the unstoppable force of Progress.  In this vision, technology makes traditional business a useless, bygone era.  Consumers of the future will ask: ‚ÄúWhy go to the store when all this can be easily purchased online?‚Äù <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Mixing mobile and real worlds</b> <br><br>  We can already see it happening today.  Almost any conceivable action can be carried out online.  E-commerce is growing, fueled by increasing and increasing digital advertising.

      The entire Internet, which is almost 1 billion active websites, now lives in our pockets. <br><br>  But is it?  Is it only a matter of time that the shops on our street will become the echo of our departed past, waiting for the demolition? <br><br>  Not certainly in that way. <br><br>  <b>Retail is still important</b> <br><br>  Assuming that expanding and increasingly complex digital advertising, especially mobile, will turn Consumer away from offline stores, this is the easiest thing to do.  But this assumption does not become true. <br><br>  E-commerce has been growing for many years, but 93% of all sales are still in offline stores (data from Q1 2015). <br><br>  While the majority of the buying process can really begin online, in the end, its completion occurs at the counter of a real store. <br><br>  So, let's not think about mobile advertising, as a force that turns consumers away from offline stores, as it may appear in the utopian future, ‚Äúcaptured‚Äù by e-commerce. <br><br>  Instead, let‚Äôs view mobile advertising as what it really is: a tool that can deliver your message, whatever it is, to as many target recipients as possible, wherever they are. <br><br>  In some cases, this advertising message can actually lead to your website, online store.  But in others, it can also lead directly to your real store or office.  And, in fact, there is no tool and form of advertising that would be suitable for this better than mobile advertising. <br><br>  <b>Directing mobile consumers to your retail store</b> <br><br>  Let's imagine our average, modern customer.  He has an idea in his head, an idea about the product he wants to buy.  But in the beginning he needs to do research.  And, at the present time, it is already possible to guarantee that such research of the market and characteristics of the goods will be carried out online, collecting information from different sites, comparing brands, seeking feedback from previous buyers. <br><br>  And, also, now there is a very big chance that he carries out these researches from a mobile device.  The share of smartphone owners in Russia is 66%, and they use them at least an hour a day.  The percentage of mobile Internet traffic is also constantly growing.  According to Adobe's CMO.com survey, in 2014, <a href="http://www.cmo.com/articles/2014/5/6/Mind_Blowing_Stats_Online_Shopping.html">84% of shoppers</a> in the offline store used their mobile devices before or during their visit to the store. <br><br>  And if this is true, there are great opportunities for brands to lead the Consumer straight to their offline store using mobile advertising. <br><br>  It makes sense. <br><br>  The modern consumer is constantly on the move.  He is either on his way to work, or vice versa, meetings, dinners, social activities with children, he simply does not have time to sit at the desktop and study the characteristics of the goods and prices.  He needs information about the product immediately while he is in daily care, and not when he wants to rest in the evening after work. <br><br>  To do this, our consumer uses his smartphone to get information of interest to him, in order not to interrupt his daily activities and use brief moments of free time with benefits. <br><br>  <b>Your advertisement, your message</b> <br><br>  But if he is already conducting his research from the phone, why should he simply not buy the product of interest in the online store? <br><br>  It really depends on what you want him to do.  Your ad can monitor and direct it. <br><br>  You do not have an online store?  Do not worry.  Direct it, using your mobile advertising, to your offline store. <br><br>  And if you are really a creative person, you can even make a purchase offline using specific mobile functionality, not only possible, but also more convenient and attractive. <br><br><ul><li>  Mobile advertising can use your potential consumer‚Äôs GPS location data to direct your store to the nearest one. </li><li>  It can provide information about a specific store product, which you have in stock, and which is selling off. </li><li>  She can also offer coupon discounts and gifts that your consumer can use in the store by activating them through her mobile device. </li></ul><br><br>  If he already explores your product on his smartphone, the likelihood that he will look for the nearest store to him is very high.  In addition, if he already uses a mobile phone, it probably means that he is already on his way to you. <br><br>  So take advantage and give him the information he is looking for. <br><br>  In addition, just as some people may like the convenience of buying goods online, there are a lot of those who just need to go to the store and see the products that interest him live.  In this case, the product is real, you can touch it, try it on, and you do not have to wait an indefinite amount of time until the transaction passes, the order will be processed and the product will be packaged and delivered. <br><br>  The essence of mobile advertising is a creative and effective delivery of your advertising message to consumers.  And where this message will send them, ultimately, will depend only on you! <br><br> <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/register/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dcontent_marketing"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/041/3c5/29a/0413c529a1424210a02b160e54a40e80.png"></a> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg">BYYD ‚Ä¢ Mobile Advertising Platform</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/292492/">https://habr.com/ru/post/292492/</a></p>
