In the middle of February, the 4th conference of the JavaScript and Frontend developers community took place in Minsk.  Guitars were not beaten about the stage here, but ‚Äúlit‚Äù in full.  Let's roll! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/100/6eb/f31/1006ebf315538a1bff4b5b310198b86a.jpg" alt="image"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h3>  Intro </h3><br>  This year, the Rolling Scopes community is preparing to celebrate its first anniversary: ‚Äã‚Äã5 years ago, our colleague Dmitry Vorobey was excited about the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãgathering a company of like-minded people in order to share experience in their free time from work tasks, implement original ideas and‚Ä¶ drove away.  During this time, a small community managed to grow into a whole movement and become a brand.  More than 40 meetings were held, Gomel, Grodno and Brest, as well as Polish Krakow and Gdansk joined the Minsk meetings.  The ‚Äúbranch‚Äù of rollinglings will soon appear in Mogilev, there is an <a href="https://school.rollingscopes.com/">RS school</a> , in which only 500 people have been trained in 2017 only.

We strive to create a special atmosphere.  There is a school where almost everyone can be a mentor or a trainer and interact with the participants on an ongoing basis, tell something, share news.  Now 70 mentors and more than 20 teachers are involved in the school.  I constantly get feedback from people who study.  They, for example, have no specialized education, they change their profession.  The guys like it, they are pleased that after such free training they get into EPAM or other companies and this is a very inspiring feedback. ‚Äù </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b86/b8d/db2/b86b8ddb2975497fe576f323f74022e6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Registration for the conference closed in 4 hours.  Nearly 1000 people spent the weekend under the sign of Rolling Scopes: pumped, communicated and painted customized badges.  Those who could not get to the conference joined the live broadcast from the Palace of Trade Unions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d9a/441/2f1/d9a4412f1bf4fa260bbdcdb902b85639.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b61/6a1/ec7/b616a1ec71312110bffa1c88d59fcdc4.png" alt="image" align="left"><blockquote>  <b>Yulia Rumyantseva:</b> <br>  ‚ÄúIn general, Rolling Scopes is life changing.  Yesterday, the guys were members of the community, today they have become active contributors, and tomorrow they will become speakers, leaders, and develop the movement in their cities.  A community is a big family that has united around the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãmaking the world a better place, making the web better.  It can be a long time alone to look for a solution to their task, or you can come to the guys, ask a question and this will be the topic of the next meeting.  You can come into the community and say, "I have a great idea, let's do it."  We ran drones through code, played the guitar through code ‚Äî there are a lot of such examples of implementing interesting tasks. ‚Äù </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9c7/4d0/d00/9c74d0d00d7144d3443f03b2cf02633f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  2 days, 2 streams, 33 reports and speakers from Belarus, Russia, Albania, India, Serbia, Great Britain, Poland, Ukraine, Holland and Germany. <br><br>  Immediately after the opening speeches of the organizers, the large hall of the Palace of Trade Unions was encouraged by our colleague Andrey Volchenko with his report.  His story about non-trivial solutions in the field of mobile development using js and webgl raised many questions from the audience. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6eb/57f/c83/6eb57fc8311a940e97f0cc403b5ca90d.png" alt="image" align="left"><blockquote>  <b>Andrey Volchenko:</b> <br>  "I said that you should not always rely on frameworks and their performance, you should not be afraid to look under the hood and get rid of several abstractions for the sake of performance, which is now being talked about so much." </blockquote><br><br>  Kristi Progre, a community leader from Albania, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DYNAtuKUx9Og%26t%3D9s">spoke about her experience in building a Mozilla community in small cities</a> , sharing organizational ‚Äúrakes‚Äù and secrets on maintaining the morale of the engineering community. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2ea/760/66e/2ea76066ede7a471b34a830c5769173c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The report of our colleague Ales Zwil <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D57m27q_xE68">‚ÄúStream API, through Redux-Observable in Electron-based app‚Äù</a> was devoted to the development of desktop applications. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1bc/1ed/c34/1bc1edc340bbc220a3e2f3fdfdf30968.png" alt="image" align="left"><blockquote>  <b>Ales Zwil:</b> <br>  ‚ÄúI took part in two RS meetings in Gomel, and now I had the opportunity to speak at a full-fledged conference - it was super cool!  The report talked about personal experience of using a not quite familiar set of technologies and showed that you can combine pretty funny things and create some unusual combinations for solving non-trivial tasks.  Diversify the daily life of developers due to this.  There were several reports that I would like to especially note - a report from Marek Pyasetski - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Db6vD9ASIoxo">Beyond React</a> , I also liked the report from Alexey Migutsky on how to make more money in Frontend. ‚Äù </blockquote><br>  The tale of microservices started by Konstantin Krivlenya, and Ivan Jovanovic continued his acquaintance with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DLH3QoDWAD8k%26t%3D826s">what micro Frontend is and what problem it solves, and also how to build applications using React, Angular, and Vue simultaneously</a> with detailed examples of implementation and many more macro details about microservices. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/50c/0de/62c/50c0de62c4e61cf8d8651e07e30c0156.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DyFU2UQF2B8BXAVZn6uc-W1rIwc32_k9">Experience of using Flow on a large project</a> touched upon Alexander Shushunov, telling about the tools and problems that can be encountered during testing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/119/007/fb9/119007fb900458886b8774a304aadc41.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  According to another of our colleagues, Mikhail Gatilov, his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Dp8F-UIzuJtA">Codemods</a> report <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Dp8F-UIzuJtA">and the transformation of JavaScript code</a> on the principles of operation and analysis of AST should be viewed in order to understand the basic principles of working with syntax trees. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e8f/31a/6e5/e8f31a6e5916bab463e9b90582e03082.png" alt="image" align="left"><blockquote>  <b>Mikhail Gatilov:</b> <br>  ‚ÄúMany front-end developers use tools like Babel, eslint.  I covered the topic a little, showed how you can write plugins for these tools yourself and it is easy to do.  In addition, I shared my experience with such a wonderful tool as jscodeshift.  We use it on the project to update our javascript code.  For example, when we want to use some new features of the language, or we switch to new versions of the lib.  Using this tool, we can write our own scripts through which our entire code base is run, and we get the desired result: old structures are deleted and replaced with new ones. <br>  I liked most of all 2 reports: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DNaEiH3Z1qqI%26t%3D10s">‚ÄúThe elegance of decorated Redux‚Äù by</a> Ilya Sachka and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D2G6Eo6Z9n9I">‚ÄúJourney through VR and AR with React‚Äù by</a> Tomasz Lakomy. ‚Äù </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ef3/22d/3d5/ef322d3d50d4f8699e48c32dc1eeb44a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Examples of real hacks in his report <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D_P5aiH1RLOI">‚ÄúHow to hack a node app?‚Äù</a> Brought Asim Hussain. <br><br>  (More video reports are available <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D57m27q_xE68%26list%3DPLe--kalBDwjgH1MQpttWyHmDR98Q404Tn">here</a> , speaker presentations are <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DyFU2UQF2B8BXAVZn6uc-W1rIwc32_k9">here</a> ). <br><br>  If you haven‚Äôt been at RS meetings and haven‚Äôt heard anything about the community, then you should have seen the logo - the movie on the four support wheels - JavaScript, HTML, CSS and Node.  Js.  The conference added the fifth wheel - UX design.  The second day of Rolling Scopes was almost entirely devoted to this direction.  EPAMs took over almost half of the UX stream. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6ee/1b6/7e9/6ee1b67e99e8bfcb3a3d78263798768e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Vitaly Novikov taught the way of design thinking of the participants and guests of the conference.  In his report <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D_qBJvY_kbyU">‚ÄúWhen there are a lot of products and a little bit of designers,‚Äù</a> he told in detail about the management of design teams in a large company, gave advice on how to optimize and properly communicate with managers, developers, customers and users. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c5c/eb8/acc/c5ceb8acc3887c39b10f16971ae9e9f3.png" alt="image" align="left"><blockquote>  <b>Vitaly Novikov:</b> <br>  ‚ÄúA modern design approach allows us to identify not only the needs of the business, but also to study the requirements and expectations of users.  We analyze the problems of those who will then use the product.  But to do this is extremely difficult.  Time and resources are never enough.  But by properly building processes and creating a cohesive team, you can make sure that what 60 designers have previously done today performed 10, improving the quality of ready-made solutions at times. ‚Äù </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dc2/04e/862/dc204e8625469a8311a23366f00f34f7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The problem of interconnection and prototyping in his report, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DhMNys-hRrmI">Resource-Resource, but not recourse was</a> raised by Dmitry Vanitsky.  Many believe that these two steps go one by one, but Dima will try to dissuade you from this. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fe5/bd7/79d/fe5bd779ddc44a4d96a31753c9209c5d.png" alt="image" align="left"><blockquote>  <b>Dmitry Vanitsky:</b> <br>  ‚ÄúI think my report will appeal to anyone who is sick for the result and does not want to conduct research, for the sake of a useless collection of artifacts that nobody needs. </blockquote><br><br>  Well, how to prevent this, you will learn from the speech itself.  By the way, Dima is keeping his young <a href="https://medium.com/%40McSmouk">blog</a> , where you can read an article on the same topic. <br><br>  Fyodor Shepelenko told about trends in building design systems: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/826/6db/c72/8266dbc72ce5f1fc289a291151db0db5.png" alt="image" align="left"><blockquote>  <b>Fedor Shepelenko:</b> <br>  ‚ÄúMy report was called‚Äú Lego for Designers ‚Äù.  It is dedicated to creating a single system design for a large number of products.  I told you how to create it correctly, what mistakes we encountered in our team on this way and what could have been avoided.  The conference itself is very cool and lamp.  I participated as a speaker for the first time and in fact everything went well. </blockquote><br>  Examples of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DOIs_03m_ED4%26t%3D1583s">designer surprises</a> led Eugene Jour.  Her report was one of the most talked about speeches of the second day. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/692/142/ba6/692142ba67a61074e88c17463183d3b3.png" alt="image" align="left"><blockquote>  <b>Evgenia Jour:</b> <br>  ‚ÄúThe report was directed mainly at developers.  I showed that it was not enough for a designer to simply draw and demonstrated cases where visual solutions did not solve real problems and vice versa: interfaces without a strong visual component that are quite viable and popular.  The first time was the speaker (not only in RS, but in general).  And because of this, she was so nervous that instead of going on the reports, she sat and got ready for the performance.  The guys at RS are very cool and feel one of them is an indescribable feeling! </blockquote><br><h3>  Instead of track bonus </h3><br>  The highlight of the second day of the conference was the workshop <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Dx1vAevI5kIg">‚ÄúThink like a designer‚Äù</a> .  Anyone could try their hand at a new role and, together with the mentors, got acquainted with the design thinking methodology.  The participants were given a specific task - to draw robots that would help people in traveling.  The guys conducted interviews with potential users, creatively on brainstorming, confirmed or refuted their hypotheses, and by the end of the workshop, presented prototypes of products to the public.  Moral: the real solution that will find a response from the user is always the result of a complex work and a built process. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6fb/dd4/b35/6fbdd4b35a249c48bb94d3b06e4cee3e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a8a/11c/be8/a8a11cbe8dc5ceb4b83c71d6fee77ec2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Outro </h3><br>  A few weeks passed, and conversations about the conference did not subside.  And if, inspired by the music festival, a new hit is born to the performer, then after the conference of developers, ours will definitely get something very interesting. <br>  News about upcoming events and Rolling Scopes school is <a href="https://rollingscopes.com/">here</a> . <br>  Join the community in <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/TheRollingScopes/about/">FB</a> or <a href="https://vk.com/therollingscopes">VK</a> . <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ySaK-AkZojk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/350250/">https://habr.com/ru/post/350250/</a></p>
