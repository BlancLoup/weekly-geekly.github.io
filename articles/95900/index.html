I recently counted how many reviews I have already written - I was surprised, I thought a lot.  On the one hand, there is still a desire to continue, but on the other hand, the vocabulary without repetitions should have ended long ago. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e85/72b/8d1/e8572b8d13d5a2eafe05573c545a8c6d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  But more and more recently, I began to think about how to make, if not a new format of posts, then at least something new for yourself, unusual for you.  While I called all this ‚Äú <b>Planet Zhelezyaka</b> ‚Äù - evaluate what happened? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  What do I plan to write in such posts?  Honestly, I don‚Äôt understand myself completely, but I know one thing - I want to get rid of the meticulous specifics.  Why describe everything that can be seen in the photo?  Why count the number of vents in the device, if everyone knows how to count :) Joke.

      Most likely, while it will be periodic issues about various devices and computer-related things, about which, for one reason or another, I did not think to write in more detail.  There can be a lot of reasons for this: somewhere there is a fog of ignorance (with which I prefer to fight), somewhere I saw the device for a short time and did not have time to thoroughly figure it out, somewhere - a little off topic on Habr, and somewhere just lazy or primitively I want to sleep off) And sometimes I just say " <i>Damn, Burum, good <s>teasing</s> to write about the glands that no one can afford - be a realist!</i> ".  In general, there are really many reasons.  By the way, here's another one - many more and more only began to look at the pictures (I saw the glossy screen on the photo? Tell the first about it in the comments - there will be pluses), rather than reading into the text, which sometimes I carry all night.  Yes, and I ... I can not understand all this and act as a "lawyer device", laying out all the information, as if I was some kind of guru.  I want a dialogue, not a monologue ... sometimes I want to ask questions myself, learn something together, share something.  In general, I will try to save my and your time, and to do it with benefit for all. <br><br>  Let me just say that detailed reviews will not disappear anywhere, but in the digests I will still write only about what I personally happened to meet.  Those.  There will be no reviews of the iPhone 4 (the day after the announcement) from the pictures from the electronic gadget and other ‚Äúarticles‚Äù for rating.  But the announcements of the most interesting new products - I do not exclude.  I also do not exclude that I will talk about some useful programs, Internet services and maybe even games - we'll see, because my horizons are not limited to devices alone, but there is always something to say.  Maybe they will talk about ways to solve various tasks / problems, with the ability to ask questions - after all, now just ask a question, by creating a separate topic - deadly) Or, maybe, organize the reception of similar stories and questions in a personal?  Okay, let's see - send your crazy ideas - we will discuss, but something will definitely grow with us!  In the meantime, it is clear that nothing is clear yet, so let's not pull the cat by the tail and move on to a short story about a couple of devices. <br><br>  Today in the issue: <br><br>  - Mouse, pad and stand for the cooler master laptop bag <br>  - Laptop bag Logitech Kinetik <br>  - Headphones Audio-Technica ATH-A900 <br>  - Cowon A3 Portable Media Player <br><br><h2>  Mouse Cooler Master C-PM01-W2 </h2><br>  From where, ask, is there so much ‚Äúmaster cooler‚Äù?  And I will answer - in the spring on the top crust there was an event from one well-known magazine, where this company was one of the sponsors.  Contests, prizes - in general, a little effort and I also came under a small hand - I won a mouse, a game pad and something for a laptop. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/769/896/369/769896369fad0aa396174e1947cf2cc8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  This, by the way, is not so much Cooler Master, as Choiix is ‚Äã‚Äãa subsidiary that produces all peripherals.  About the relationship of these two companies can be found on the websites of both manufacturers or on the packaging of any product.  Therefore, the mouse can also be found on request <b>Choiix C-PM01-W2</b> - God, who only came up with this name. <br><br>  The mouse is primarily designed for a laptop - this is indicated by the modest size and USB-cable, retractable into the secret compartment at the bottom of the device.  If necessary, the wire (it is "tape" form) is easily obtained - it can be "shortened" or, conversely, stretched (to 0.75 m) - all manipulations are fixed by some kind of internal mechanism.  Such a solution is much more practical and more pleasant for the eye than winding a wire on a gutter at the base of a rodent, which is found, for example, in Logitech. <br><br>  The mouse is made of white glossy plastic, with gray inserts - pleasant to the touch and not at all brandy;  The green wheel looks like a pistachio stuck in a delicious ice cream.  To do something ergonomic in such sizes is difficult, so it is, as it is;  Immediately after connecting to the USB port, the mouse starts working - the click is fairly quiet and resilient.  Despite the name Choiix (which for some reason I involuntarily associate with all kinds of Abibos), there are no hints of Chinese breadth. <br>  In fact, the mouse has nothing but two buttons and a wheel.  Oh, and an optical sensor at 800dpi.  But precisely because of such minimalism, it is not very inexpensive - about 600 rubles (although it‚Äôs not easy to find the mouse itself). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3dc/fe8/b16/3dcfe8b168f909f7f3287ff6bce3910c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  If there is a laptop, the touchpad of which does not suit you, then the mouse will become a very reasonable purchase.  The size and design of this mouse will easily allow you to take it with you, but otherwise, this is the most ordinary mouse without any frills.  I, for example, can no longer do without the forward / back buttons. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/38e/a8c/50b/38ea8c50b685759b53c27c5e9de5f932.png" alt="image">  Clickable <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/305/758/31f/30575831f0fd0dd05a441aa3b01d1be1.jpg" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3e1/f41/aa3/3e1f41aa3b653d3be7007cc1a8446bc8.jpg" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7c5/8bb/9be/7c58bb9beee55358d96aca15f7fe2a84.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ab1/9e2/15a/ab19e215a047a82d2dbca7f661bbb98a.jpg" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ecf/305/99b/ecf30599b27ab8ce2c24a86372af4998.jpg" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/361/e83/3e9/361e833e9e7a2b87770646ce738bba71.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/757/5a6/4d1/7575a64d181b030cb8096884a20d661f.jpg" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8ce/29c/f75/8ce29cf753fa12267e888c0cc32a827c.jpg" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/876/255/376/876255376dbcbc18ad526d0cedf6f077.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/af2/94a/228/af294a2281f2c106ec7aac2f877a8602.png" alt="image">  <b>Advantages and disadvantages</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/881/117/ccb/881117ccbc836c685868fb19a2bf46c1.png" alt="+">  Pleasant in appearance and touch; <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/881/117/ccb/881117ccbc836c685868fb19a2bf46c1.png" alt="+">  Adjustable wire length;  the wire itself can be removed; <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/881/117/ccb/881117ccbc836c685868fb19a2bf46c1.png" alt="+">  Equally suitable for both right-handers and left-handers; <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/881/117/ccb/881117ccbc836c685868fb19a2bf46c1.png" alt="+">  Low price <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/24f/0ae/920/24f0ae920b085ead2e6d649649177122.png" alt="-">  For constant dragging would not prevent the case <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/24f/0ae/920/24f0ae920b085ead2e6d649649177122.png" alt="-">  Sorry, the wheel can not be dodged to the side <br><br>  <b>Price</b> : from 600 rubles <br><br>  Overview of another notebook mouse - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/76623/">Razer Orochi</a> <br><br><h2>  Rug Cooler Master CS-M Weapon of Choice M4 </h2><br>  Another axillary front fighter is made of faceless cardboard packaging;  it is already from CM Storm, another Cooler Master unit that creates devices for computer players.  The dimensions of the carpet are 405x285x3 (mm) - practically the same as those of the largest (Alpha, 444xx355x4.3 mm) Razer Goliathus.  I recently <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/86550/">wrote about gaming carpets</a> , and if we draw an analogy with the same Razer Goliathus, this one is something between a Speed ‚Äã‚Äãcoating and a Control.  With careful consideration, the recurring structure of weaving is clearly visible, however, it feels quite smooth to the touch - the mouse with the teflon and ceramic legs glide perfectly.  The lower part of the rubber and holds well the grip with the table. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/db8/d58/784/db8d58784d8887ff96b5cfa304e080b9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The image is applied to the coating ( <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colt_M4">M4A1</a> machine gun) and the text, which, in my opinion, can scare away some buyers - such a carpet is perfect only for players who do not hide it at all) Mud will not be noticeable - too, too ... but Goliathus looks much "More mature."  But the price for the "automatic" most average market - from 700 rubles per piece.  And what, like flash drives - a very versatile gift. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/38e/a8c/50b/38ea8c50b685759b53c27c5e9de5f932.png" alt="image">  Clickable <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/90d/d7b/7d9/90dd7b7d903bd51f33748206d471f103.jpg" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/abf/d33/724/abfd33724a5bc5e16dac7724542a5bde.jpg" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e39/22f/f06/e3922ff06f9876d638be065fd904a53b.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/af2/94a/228/af294a2281f2c106ec7aac2f877a8602.png" alt="image">  <b>Advantages and disadvantages</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/881/117/ccb/881117ccbc836c685868fb19a2bf46c1.png" alt="+">  Large area, good grip <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/881/117/ccb/881117ccbc836c685868fb19a2bf46c1.png" alt="+">  Perfect for any type of sensor. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/24f/0ae/920/24f0ae920b085ead2e6d649649177122.png" alt="-">  Drawing on the fan <br><br>  <b>Price</b> : from 700 rubles <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/297/94d/1bb/29794d1bbabeb31a7227ff222693d6e2.png" alt="image">  I recommend to view the post " <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/86550/">Fighters axillary front</a> " <br><br><h2>  Cooler Master Ergonomic Metal Sleeve laptop case stand </h2><br>  In general, it is also from the Choiix subdivision, and on the website is referred to as a ‚Äúcover for a laptop‚Äù - in principle, everything is as it is.  The design is very simple - a fairly thick sheet of brushed aluminum is bent at a right angle and it is the ‚Äúouter‚Äù side or the main protection of the fragile filling.  Everything else around is made of durable fabric that is stitched many times and is generally very reliable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f45/66f/2a4/f4566f2a4a9a90026a7017aa9c186963.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On top and on the sides through the slits in the aluminum sheet are folding fabric "Velcro" - they do not allow the laptop to fall out, but at the same time, from any side allow him to get it.  Another advantage of this design is that the thickness of the ‚Äúportfolio‚Äù can be adjusted.  For example, so that the laptop does not hang inside like a pencil in a glass, or so that you can put a couple more thick magazines.  A sort of universal folder. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6a9/2bc/041/6a92bc0412ac02204d8fd9ed55b1021d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  But this one has one more application - if you pull out a laptop and put it on a metal surface, then you get a real stand.  Without any additional features - just a stand that can be put on your knees, which can be put under a sheet of paper.  So the stand is very mobile - the laptop is worn right in it, unlike most of the other stands. <br><br>  With this briefcase, I recently went to St. Petersburg for a Nokia conference - yes, with this briefcase alone.  Tests passed - very convenient. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/483/f02/576/483f02576f7bd0156969f124214b43a3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  There are several colors - brown, pink, blue and light green. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/38e/a8c/50b/38ea8c50b685759b53c27c5e9de5f932.png" alt="image">  Clickable <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e36/f73/578/e36f735783575ca29c94120d775d8dd5.jpg" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/510/759/603/5107596032b29ad952804e135df0c360.jpg" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/138/fff/9db/138fff9dbdf31e8f13d0026a8780d077.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4e4/5fa/3e0/4e45fa3e085a32701c191b9abf36579c.jpg" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c29/afc/c5b/c29afcc5bb78492615dc4127c25cf50f.jpg" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/359/87c/ad9/35987cad9ead625b811d3d7a96e95aae.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a76/bc3/871/a76bc38710a66c9266d4c22d240df73f.jpg" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/671/3cb/a84/6713cba84365e02f236dea06d165e059.jpg" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/56d/8c2/688/56d8c2688f4d04438d88a67677afd052.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/af2/94a/228/af294a2281f2c106ec7aac2f877a8602.png" alt="image">  <b>Advantages and disadvantages</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/881/117/ccb/881117ccbc836c685868fb19a2bf46c1.png" alt="+">  Simple but robust design <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/881/117/ccb/881117ccbc836c685868fb19a2bf46c1.png" alt="+">  The laptop is worn inside, i.e.  there is no need for a separate stand <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/881/117/ccb/881117ccbc836c685868fb19a2bf46c1.png" alt="+">  Adjustable folder thickness <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/24f/0ae/920/24f0ae920b085ead2e6d649649177122.png" alt="-">  Not enough "compartment" or eyelets for at least one pen <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/24f/0ae/920/24f0ae920b085ead2e6d649649177122.png" alt="-">  Everyone will know for sure that you have a laptop there. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/24f/0ae/920/24f0ae920b085ead2e6d649649177122.png" alt="-">  Under the rain will not save <br><br>  <b>Price</b> : I have not found it anywhere, but it is unlikely to exceed 500-1000 rubles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/297/94d/1bb/29794d1bbabeb31a7227ff222693d6e2.png" alt="image">  Overview of the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/72222/">cooling stand</a> from GlacialTech. <br><br><h2>  Laptop bag Logitech Kinetik </h2><br>  I can‚Äôt imagine what the comments could be if I wrote a separate review of the laptop bag) But the matter is, in fact, more than serious and responsible - when it comes to choosing this one, you understand that you don‚Äôt understand anything in this matter.  Or that all choice is limited to Chinese handicrafts from the nearest store. <br><br>  The <b>Logitech Kinetik</b> bag is from the most well-known peripheral giant and is diametrically opposed to the Choiix mentioned above.  Dark gray, almost black - one of the sides is made of fabric, and the second has a more solid surface, resembling a soft-touch.  Can be worn by the handle, but as an option - worn on the shoulder, fastened on the carabiners a long soft belt from the kit.  The suitcase is formed by three independent departments, each of which is intended for something specific. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6ac/0e4/32d/6ac0e432de765190ba0f0288b8132126.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The size of the photo (and in reality) - the most common case, not large and not small.

And all this is very carefully laid out in its place, and there is still space for any trash! <br><br>  Inside, everything is trimmed with orange synthetics - there are a lot of velcro sections, each of which has icons (if things are laid out on them, then it will be much easier to navigate).  The compartment under the laptop is central and rightly so that it is equidistant from both sides;  it is made of soft-touch fabric, which will not damage even the most delicate laptop - the latter can additionally be fastened with a special strap. <br><br>  Each zipper has two metal sliders, which, being with each other, thunder.  But branches open almost all along the perimeter - this is good. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8a0/abf/6ad/8a0abf6adc2657da2a3e05bead4c4056.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I use it not so actively for two reasons - I am hanging more and more on my balcony, where the bag seems not to be needed) And the second reason is that I am a supporter of sportswear with which this suitcase does not harmonize at all.  And yet, somehow he holds down the movement - a backpack behind his back is much more convenient (by the way, there is such a modification of the kinetics too).  The bag is designed for a laptop with a diagonal of up to 15 inches, but a little larger fit.  As far as I remember, there used to be a more compact version, but, unfortunately, there is no longer any information on the official website. <br><br>  Really high-quality thing, which may well be useful to any business person.  Well, or even a student - because inside that just does not fit. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/38e/a8c/50b/38ea8c50b685759b53c27c5e9de5f932.png" alt="image">  Clickable <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/397/1d8/f98/3971d8f98c8da9acf5969ade8acbcb92.jpg" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cae/f2a/32a/caef2a32a4027acb4bee7990688ab37f.jpg" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/87e/6f6/d77/87e6f6d771da46c036f263b1649549d2.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e40/aa0/775/e40aa0775a2e1293a4994dfc4d61d331.jpg" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/042/82f/3a6/04282f3a63061ea2f53cdac2d9b0c0d3.jpg" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/909/a6d/51f/909a6d51fc4f4bb620e8f4a88e00311b.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/234/fa8/45e/234fa845e41ae1e197836f086382d442.jpg" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2b0/32a/453/2b032a453b8fe7d49a9abf45283162c7.jpg" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/62e/97d/10e/62e97d10eaa8859774f004287cca0459.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/af2/94a/228/af294a2281f2c106ec7aac2f877a8602.png" alt="image">  <b>Advantages and disadvantages</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/881/117/ccb/881117ccbc836c685868fb19a2bf46c1.png" alt="+">  Sharpened specifically for a laptop <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/881/117/ccb/881117ccbc836c685868fb19a2bf46c1.png" alt="+">  High quality workmanship, reliable materials <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/881/117/ccb/881117ccbc836c685868fb19a2bf46c1.png" alt="+">  3 compartments, incredibly roomy <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/881/117/ccb/881117ccbc836c685868fb19a2bf46c1.png" alt="+">  Waterproof <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/24f/0ae/920/24f0ae920b085ead2e6d649649177122.png" alt="-">  The ‚Äúhard‚Äù side will eventually be permanently scratched. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/24f/0ae/920/24f0ae920b085ead2e6d649649177122.png" alt="-">  Metal sliders clack when walking <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/24f/0ae/920/24f0ae920b085ead2e6d649649177122.png" alt="-">  High price <br><br>  <b>Price</b> : from 3000 rubles <br><br><h2>  Headphones Audio-Technica ATH-A900 </h2><br>  I have repeatedly written about the headphones of this Japanese company - something, and they know how to make them.  These were expensive audiophile ATH-AD1000PRM or ‚Äúcheap‚Äù and well-proven ATH-ES7, and today is the golden mean in the above-mentioned price range. <br><br>  <b>Audio-Technica ATH-A900</b> headphones belong to the Art Monitor series - monitor, dynamic.  The headband is formed by two curved arcs, and between them are two soft movable pads - all this allows you to securely hold the headphones on the head of almost any size and shape.  Blue metal cups are incredibly large - no less large speakers are hidden under massive ear cushions (membrane diameter is 57 mm).  When you put the headphones on your head, your ears fit completely into the ambush room.  Noise isolation is quite good, it is mostly formed due to the closed construction;  bass, in contrast to the same AD1000PRM, are present in full.  Even if you sit in them for a long time, there is no discomfort. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/73b/1fa/7ab/73b1fa7ab89866341a5ce77ef375fe69.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The most important thing in any headphones is the sound quality, but it is not worth talking about it here - it is at the highest level.  Of course, I‚Äôve already forgotten how the ‚Äúthousandth‚Äù version sounds, but with a good sound source (I had a ASUS Essence STX sound card), any owner will be satisfied - after a few hours of listening to different sound material (including at a very high volume ), I did not find anything serious that I could find fault with.  None of the players (iPod touch, Cowon S9, Cowon D2 +) could not unleash the full potential of headphones, which, in fact, quite surprising. <br>  A separate paragraph I want to praise the wire - it is woven and extremely flexible.  Its length is 3 meters - it ends is also very interesting: a mini-jack on 3.5mm, on top of which you can literally screw the jack on 6.5mm. <br>  Total - great expensive headphones for the home.  But once again - they are just huge! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/38e/a8c/50b/38ea8c50b685759b53c27c5e9de5f932.png" alt="image">  Clickable <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/54d/afb/400/54dafb400fd7da1cd180e0a635f3574e.jpg" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/25a/fe8/70d/25afe870dd323640de567db839d07d5f.jpg" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8aa/172/287/8aa1722878172e4f5bd66044273b0cb6.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/630/57b/e28/63057be2874eaa65b795f836a31683c9.jpg" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/430/135/38b/43013538b3495e09bf2451709cae9205.jpg" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3c3/efa/62d/3c3efa62d792432e0799dcd43b1176fa.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/85d/691/1d8/85d6911d8a57a0f6ef933487f04c5872.jpg" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e77/8de/a9a/e778dea9ae4836fc4c64aaf135374bf4.jpg" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f70/73b/e0a/f7073be0ac3f69720f4ef2e455a57e77.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/af2/94a/228/af294a2281f2c106ec7aac2f877a8602.png" alt="image">  <b>Advantages and disadvantages</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/881/117/ccb/881117ccbc836c685868fb19a2bf46c1.png" alt="+">  Good workmanship, reliable wire and overall construction <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/881/117/ccb/881117ccbc836c685868fb19a2bf46c1.png" alt="+">  Stay firmly on the head, good insulation <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/881/117/ccb/881117ccbc836c685868fb19a2bf46c1.png" alt="+">  Great sound quality <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/24f/0ae/920/24f0ae920b085ead2e6d649649177122.png" alt="-">  Very large in size <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/24f/0ae/920/24f0ae920b085ead2e6d649649177122.png" alt="-">  High price <br><br>  <b>Price</b> : from 8500 rubles <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/297/94d/1bb/29794d1bbabeb31a7227ff222693d6e2.png" alt="image">  Reviews of other headphones: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/85811/">ATH-ES7</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/77565/">ATH-AD1000</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/67293/">Razer Megalodon</a> <br><br><h2>  Portable Media Player Cowon A3 </h2><br>  You can‚Äôt call it a novelty - this device is already several years old and even in selling it is not so easy to find it (the manufacturer has released new models, which I hope to write about someday).  But the ability to perform the role of a pocket media player - for which he had the device did not go away. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a2a/6b5/182/a2a6b518202acf1d45899c639eec22a1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The player is based on a hard disk (the maximum volume of which is 80GB) - almost the entire front side is occupied by a 4 ‚Äù-inch screen with a high resolution of 800x480 (16: 9, 16.7 million colors).  Apparently, it is the hard disk that makes up the bulk of the device - it is almost 300 grams with a non-removable battery.  The latter, by the way, is enough for 6-7 hours of video, and with less intensive use - up to 15-18 hours. <br>  On the sides, at first you notice not so much of everything - because of the stub on the left side.  If you open it, the entire wealth of player interfaces becomes the following: USB host, power connector, line-in (with recording) and output, video-in (with recording) and video output.  And most of the necessary wires are already included. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/988/b77/e49/988b77e49f4874999b1a56158f987663.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The device turns on very quickly - soon a colorful and intuitive menu appears before the user.  The first time is unusual, that the screen is not touch - all control is carried out by a 5-position joystick and three buttons, each of which is associated with one or another function in different menus. <br><br>  The speakers of the device (there are two of them on the lower edge) are quite loud, but headphones will most likely be used more often - there are no problems with this either, everything is in the best traditions of Cowon.  The player lost most of the non-converted video files, but there were problems with some high-bitrate and high-resolution ones - they were not lost, slowed down or out of sync.  But otherwise, there are no problems and the omnivorousness of the device is simply amazing - MP3 / 2/1, MP4, ASF, WMA, FLAC, OGG, M4A, MATROSKA (MKA, MKV), TTA, APE, MPC, WV, WAV, AVI, WMV, ASF, MPG / MPEG, DAT, MTV, TXT, JPG, GIF, PNG, TIF, BMP (up to 15 mpix) and subtitles in SMI, SRT, SUB (text) and DivX bitmap formats.  The only thing that is just too tough for the player is the VOB format. <br><br>  In addition to multimedia features, the player can serve as a device for reading electronic books - it is enough to set the minimum brightness (to save battery) and a suitable design style, of which there are plenty. <br>  There are a lot of settings and everything is in somewhat clumsy Russian language - flexible settings of the screen, sound and recording quality, subtitles and scrolling speed of the text, alarm clock and much more.  It is possible to change the firmware - the device connects to the computer (like a regular USB flash drive), the system files are thrown, the reboot ... and you're done.  After downloading, you need to specify the USA region, then the volume will be more. <br>  This player is perfect for the road - you can fit a huge amount of information into it.  But, I repeat, the device is already quite difficult to find on sale - the same Cowon company has released equally interesting new items of this class. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/38e/a8c/50b/38ea8c50b685759b53c27c5e9de5f932.png" alt="image">  Clickable <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c16/e37/0e8/c16e370e83f9b2cbabeaa325babb3273.jpg" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/af8/49e/23f/af849e23f08e705f18bf06c35a06d487.jpg" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5f2/92a/a94/5f292aa94bf9c69d3754471c354376da.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/972/98e/7d2/97298e7d2521b122ccb519e5d44e91f4.jpg" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/326/2af/561/3262af561c3bb4d1af78d8db2cd2bdea.jpg" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/203/e3f/105/203e3f1054403f9c68f407365397ee5c.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/46d/bb8/a88/46dbb8a88aded040bc1fa1caa18eedb6.jpg" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9f3/1d5/d4d/9f31d5d4d99ecf40f74bfd9b5e119a10.jpg" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/336/c9c/313/336c9c3138fe772e42d26e0184b0ca8b.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d4a/9c8/74a/d4a9c874a4d19b84a042f40736740188.jpg" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/eed/381/fff/eed381fff9f8ac6ff4d93037923e042b.jpg" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/36e/45b/2ae/36e45b2aec81a70c55845c2c7121dd48.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5ea/a6a/659/5eaa6a659042aba4f45a95cdb68cdbe3.jpg" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0a4/23a/b9a/0a423ab9aa83b7b74268c57f656a4567.jpg" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5b0/923/762/5b0923762e6a300eb8ae5c81a8bfbeaa.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e02/9e8/0f9/e029e80f9484158f42c03afd0a77ccb8.jpg" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b01/8d8/917/b018d8917dbd966d2a7a582113ee63c2.jpg" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/428/0cf/bd9/4280cfbd9c9b8bbf99713e06361d9d13.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/790/98e/03b/79098e03b6dc2aa77489b16bc5a8d073.jpg" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/770/745/447/770745447ef02f9e2c80a7a200f520ed.jpg" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a3f/355/3c6/a3f3553c69a1d21f5c46d123b6a9cf11.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6e0/72a/aa5/6e072aaa594e6af6224058c7f7db3620.jpg" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3a6/f44/29b/3a6f4429bda0c446e1189d3afd1638b1.jpg" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b27/832/327/b27832327d343c8800df61b4de2b5dce.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/af2/94a/228/af294a2281f2c106ec7aac2f877a8602.png" alt="image">  <b>Advantages and disadvantages</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/881/117/ccb/881117ccbc836c685868fb19a2bf46c1.png" alt="+">  Good workmanship <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/881/117/ccb/881117ccbc836c685868fb19a2bf46c1.png" alt="+">  Pleasant and intuitive interface <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/881/117/ccb/881117ccbc836c685868fb19a2bf46c1.png" alt="+">  Beautiful color screen, big and bright <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/881/117/ccb/881117ccbc836c685868fb19a2bf46c1.png" alt="+">  Incredible omnivorous;
