  <section class="page js-page"><h1>From dirt to Kings!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Just some three years ago, to distribute the file on the network for a large audience was a significant problem, I tell you.  As soon as the poor (in the literal sense of the word), the ‚Äúvaresniki‚Äù were not perverted, and the one who had access to a private ftp or could distribute files from his ftp was very cool and respected.  Hacked accounts of western hosts went into circulation, files were wrapped in pictures and flooded with horribly restrictive free hosts, the lucky ones having the opportunity to distribute from their server used all sorts of anti-leasing systems saving every byte of traffic.  But the era of martyrdom was destined to end, and a thought arose in a few light German heads: why should they not do everything differently?  Apparently the guys at the time of launch were not particularly confident in their success, therefore, they started on the DE domain and started with small things, with files up to 20 mega, but they understood that although they move to the touch, they move in the right direction, and in the first days of 2005, the result of their work on the network earned the first, nowadays well-known file hosting service - <strong>RAPIDSHARE.DE</strong> , today also known as <strong><a href="http://rapidshare.com/">RAPIDSHARE.COM</a></strong> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Success came if not immediately, then very quickly, the service became popular, it could be used to easily upload links to sites with thousands of people, and anyone could download the file without any load on the distribution server.  For "Vareznikov" it was a dream that came true.  Attracting more and more webmasters and end users, the service has grown to an unprecedented size at that time, slowly also acquiring shortcomings in the form of restrictions for ordinary users and paying premium accounts.  But all this faded against the background of long-lived links to content and rapidshare began to earn money, real money, a lot of money on ‚Äúvarezny‚Äù traffic, which until now was considered junk and poorly convertible in the broad masses. <br>  Jealous of the success of RS, comparable to <a href="http://youtube.com/">YouTube,</a> literally right away, as it is found on the network, dozens of new file hosting companies began to appear, which were trying not only to take away the palm of the game, but to grab piles of huge cake called ‚Äúvarezny traffic‚Äù.  As it should be according to all the laws of nature - few have broken through, and tens of thousands of starters have fallen asleep in a Bose, being content with a six-digit AlexaRank. <br>  You probably ask, and where the owners of the distributed (illegal) content look, I‚Äôll tell you where, they look at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Millenium_Copyright_Act">Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA)</a> and remember the ‚Äúkindly quiet word‚Äù of those who have passed such laws.  If someone does not know, then in a nutshell, these laws state that the host of the hosting on which users can post any content is not responsible for this content.  Moreover, he is not even obliged to monitor the legality of distribution of this or that content; it is the responsibility of those who own the rights (copyright) to this content.  That is, ‚ÄúI am not me and the horse is not mine‚Äù, if you find something, you write to us - we will delete the file, but everyone understands that it‚Äôs like a white day to track down the content among hundreds of thousands of files uploaded by copyright holders to their file servers every day.  By the way, it was with this law that Google covered its ass when some naive gentlemen decided to run into <a href="http://youtube.com/">YouTube</a> . <br>  And then it started to spin, it suffered ... File hosting began to offer different conditions, to pay real money to those who upload files to them, in general, who into what the community encouraged the distribution of files on the network.  In the meantime, <a href="http://rapidshare.com/">RapidShare</a> became the unspoken standard on the network, and as one of the signs of its popularity, just piles of various services appeared to the network that they tried (someone successfully didn‚Äôt) warm up in glory.  Not to be unfounded, a small example, <a href="http://www.dnjournal.com/archive/domainsales/2006/Q1-expanded-globalcontenders.htm">here is a report on domain sales</a> (1st quarter of 2006), in the top ten of the Rapidshared.org domain, so this is not really a domain sale, there was a fresh project on the domain (5-6 months at the time of sale) , the project was a catalog of links to content posted on Rapidshare, although the project was young, it already had 13-15k of western traffic (it was torn off with its hands - it sold itself) <br>  The emergence of Rapidshare.com made a revolution in the whole network segment, the ability to upload files without any problems contributed to the rapid development of ‚Äúwarez‚Äù sites, and as a result of this, advertisers were forced to look in this direction.  Look at the largest (near-) warez sites - <a href="http://nnm.ru/">NNM</a> , <a href="http://kpnemo.ru/">KpNemo</a> , <a href="http://avaxhome.org/">AvaxHome</a> , <a href="http://netzor.org/">NETzor</a> and others, quite civilized advertising from well-known advertisers, hence a good income of the owners, and there would be no file hosting sites so everyone would drop on his ftp under unbearable loads.  Even in RuNet, large corporations began to glance at warez sites as a coveted object of possession, forgetting old prejudices.  It is true - the traffic does not smell. <br>  Why did I tell you all this?  Just for one vivid example I wanted to show how the bright heads from the feces candy blinded </div>
