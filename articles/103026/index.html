  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Report on the second eBukovka - meeting of electronic reading lovers in Kharkov</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On August 28, in Kharkov, the second meeting of e-reading fans was held - ‚ÄúeBukovka‚Äù.  During the three hours that lasted the event there was so much interesting that I even get lost where to start.  For a start, it is worth mentioning that this time on eBukovka, the participants brought in 13 models of electronic readers from Sony Reader and ABC, before the Barnes &amp; Noble Nook and iRex.  The star of the program was the <b>Kindle DX</b> and the <b>PocketBook 901,</b> which has not yet been officially released. <br><br><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5634655/ebookovka-28.08.2010-habr/lot-of-ebooks.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Read the full report with a <b>large number of photos</b> under the cut. <a name="habracut"></a>

      I just want to dwell on electronic readers.  The following models of book readers could be held at the meeting: Sony Reader PRS-505, 600, PocketBook 301, 302, 360, Alphabet N516, Lbook V5, V3 +, Ergo Book 0501R, B &amp; N Nook, iRex DR800, Kindle DX, PocketBook 901 Readers who do not own any of the models, and these also came, had a lot to choose from.  As on the <a href="http://blog.ibooki.com.ua/2010/06/otchet-o-provedenii-pervoj-ebukovki-v-xarkove-i-rezultaty-konkursa-v-twitter/">first eBukovka</a> , they had a wonderful opportunity to get to know and hear about the personal experience of using readers from people who have long been interested in e-reading. <br><br><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5634655/ebookovka-28.08.2010-habr/testing-books-2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The most lively interest was the presentation of Andrei Savchuk, who is also the hacker of <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/klu4nik/" class="user_link">Klu4nik</a> from the PocketBook company.  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/pocketbook/blog/">Their blog</a> recently appeared on Habr√©.  He brought to the meeting a working prototype of an electronic textbook - PocketBook 901. <br><br><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5634655/ebookovka-28.08.2010-habr/kluchnik.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Your humble servant readily <s>took away the</s> borrower and tested it on reading PDF and DJVU files, because I am familiar with this problem, and I once even dedicated a separate post to it on Habr√©.  I must say that the book reader coped with the task perfectly well.  The screen diagonal of 9.7 inches and good-quality software of domestic production makes itself felt.  It was also interesting to compare the screens of the PocketBook 901 and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/gadgets/100927/">Kindle DX</a> . <br><br><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5634655/ebookovka-28.08.2010-habr/pb901-vs-kindle-dx.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It was pleasantly surprised that according to Andrew, the widget technology will be used in PocketBook 901, 902, 903.  It will be possible to display useful information for the user on the main screen as well as for example on the iGoogle page, which is in general non-standard for book readers.  All textbooks, if necessary, can be protected with DRM technology.  Their parent kit will cost about 300 hryvnia, which is 2-3 times cheaper than paper.  The case promises to be very durable (Of course!).  True, the screens will remain glass, not plastic.  E-INK has not yet mastered the technology of production of plastic screens.  But I am pleased with the fact that even if these devices do not appear in schools, then they will definitely reach consumers.  PocketBook and 900 series will be in the same price category as the Amazon Kindle DX.  A little later will be published prices from the manufacturer. <br><br><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5634655/ebookovka-28.08.2010-habr/pb901-vs-kindle-dx-2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The eBukovka participants were very interested in information about the future Ukrainian competitor Apple iPad - the <a href="http://blog.ibooki.com.ua/2010/08/pocketbook-vyjdet-na-rynok-planshetov-s-novoj-modelyu-pocketbook-iq/">PocketBook IQ tablet</a> .  From what has been said, it became known that the device will be based on the Google Android OS and will be released this fall (though I guess not earlier than December if you are lucky. Plans are for plans).  As for the price, it will be much more affordable for the consumer than the iPad.  All details about this device will be announced at <a href="http://pocketbook-global.ru/news/events/80">IFA2010</a> . <br><br>  Of course, there were still many questions about the use of devices, about color e-paper, screen protection, DRM technology, competition, price cuts, content for readers.  Not even without bug reports.  For example, I was worried about the question of whether PocketBook will open its application market like Amazon KDK or the AppStore.  But for now, the reader has no such plans. <br><br>  Many participants brought their favorite e-books and tested its readability on different devices. <br><br><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5634655/ebookovka-28.08.2010-habr/testing-books-3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The American Barnes &amp; Noble Nook with the Russified firmware from mynook aroused quite a bit of interest.  He was brought to us from the city of Nikolaev by the habrotuser <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/dex7er/" class="user_link">dex7er</a> .  I was pleased with the Russian interface, support for FB2 and a PDF viewer with the ability to rotate the document into a landscape view.  Although everything else is still sawed and sawed. <br><br><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5634655/ebookovka-28.08.2010-habr/nook.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It's nice that the beautiful half of humanity is not indifferent to gadgets.  And even the strange name of the event did not scare them.  :) <br><br><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5634655/ebookovka-28.08.2010-habr/ladies-with-ebooks.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In general, the meeting was a great success.  I have to say that I was somewhat worried about whether everyone had enough space in the literary cafe where the meeting took place, but out of 38 registered participants 23 came. Of them, four ( <b>!</b> ) Habro users :) All those who came didn‚Äôt regret it, because that the number of gadgets, new acquaintances and useful interesting information just went off scale. <br><br><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5634655/ebookovka-28.08.2010-habr/group-foto.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I tried to write a report in hot pursuit, but there are a lot of interesting information that I could not remember or express.  I hope, dear habrochityvateli, help me with your questions. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/103026/">https://habr.com/ru/post/103026/</a></p>
