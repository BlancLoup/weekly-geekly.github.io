  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What does the clerk thinking, riding in the subway car.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Moving every morning from home to my workspace and in the evening, on the contrary, I recently began to wonder how justified is the daily movement of such a quantity of biomass, of which I am also a part.  Not only do we spend a precious few hours of life on, for the most part, silent pushing in the subway, standing in traffic jams, passing each other (airborne droplets) viruses and other microorganisms, constantly increasing the likelihood of epidemics of influenza or worse) make a daily release of energy, in anticipation of the promised crisis with hydrocarbon reserves.  There are more cars in the city every minute, and all sense of their use is lost, if you don‚Äôt like to stand in traffic jams, listen to the radio, breathe exhausts and swear by the light of your neighbor.  Metro is not better, because  already suffocating from such a number of passengers.  Why does this happen, why do people choose such psychological stress in exchange for an additional 10-15 thousand rubles, do not look for work closer to home?  Probably, some mechanisms of struggle for survival and places under the sun are working, the modern structure of employment, career building and blah blah blah blah blah, thousands of reasons, and I am not an expert in sociology, psychology, modern society, etc. But there are concrete facts of congestion of urban transport channels with all the ensuing consequences. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  Why do I lead, you ask.  And I would really like to speculate about the following.  Because  most of the moving protein in the megalopolis is, after all, clerks and other office plankton, who are in a hurry to take a place at their monitor and open their favorite platform for communication / acquaintance, purchase and maybe work, then it would probably make sense to restructure such an example.  Why move 3 hours of a person per day, spend energy on it, create huge accumulations of stress for personal transport owners and public users, if you could organize your work directly from home, having in the office only staff serving the corporate network and people who have an office presence vital. <br>  I think many corporations are thinking about this option, but the problem of its implementation in life most likely rests on the cost of its implementation, and not only money.  This is practically the creation from scratch of new work procedures, the control of personnel by the management, the implementation of a network and software platform, the solution of security problems.  And in order to realize it and feel the result, it is necessary to interest not only the industry, but also power.  Maybe I‚Äôm wasting my brain‚Äôs efforts to try to reflect on the tendency that already exists and there is a vigorous activity on its realization, but I haven‚Äôt really heard about it through the information channels I have.  Yes, there are IT organizations that distribute tasks between remote programmers, designers, etc., using outsourcing and freelancing.  But for the most part office life takes place in the office.  Yes, there are means of remote control over the work of the personal computer and the person sitting behind it, but again this is rather an insignificant detail, and it is silly to speak of the above problems using their example. <br>  I think the average organization in the future may be able to do without an office at all.  Those.  employees sit at home, servicing the servers are at the provider of this type of service, warehouse / service / transport or another type of service delivery tool is outsourced to a company specializing in this, and it remains for the organization to look for clients, analyze activities and make improvement decisions organizations).  Just a fairy tale). <br>  In conclusion, I want to say that the current situation with the development of network services is possible, there is just a vector and to what I wrote above, but so far that web N.0, so actively discussed everywhere, acts primitively and serves only as entertainment and murder time for the same clerks and the like.  But perhaps the moment will come when the count will finally transfer to the quality and unlimited possibilities of the network, will finally be sent to those channels that will solve not only issues of leisure and communication, but will also become tools for solving the more necessary. <br><br>  Good luck. </div>
