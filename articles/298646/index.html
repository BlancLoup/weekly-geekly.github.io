Which ones to use in the project?  How to determine the best?  Should I use all?  I ask them myself every time there is a need to collect subscribers. <br><br>  Under the cut, I collected six of the best, in my experience, ways to collect emails that you can quickly implement.  I ranked them according to their efficiency of use.  Most of the experience I got in the auto business, alas, there is some overlap of subjectivity.  Therefore, I urge email marketers to share their numbers and thoughts on this matter. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/17f/2d1/128/17f2d112879e4ffcaee6bf04e9eb53f8.jpg">

      Let's figure it out. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <i>Sorry for the sausages, they are just for beauty</i> <br><br><h1>  1. Popup </h1><br>  I am sure that you, as Internet professionals, have to deal with an annoying way of collecting emails - popup.  And the word "often" is the answer to the question which of the ways of gathering is the best.  Yes, popup is the most effective way to collect emails and there are two reasons for this: <br><br><h3>  Easy installation and configuration. </h3><br>  Do not write TK, do not draw layouts and prototypes, let the developers have a rest - you insert the code of your mailing system (Email Service Provider, then - ESP).  Configure the conditions for the appearance of the popup and you are already collecting emails.  Runs in 15 minutes.  From a business point of view, the speed of implementation is a parameter by which a popup gives odds to other methods. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/87c/5cd/cbf/87c5cdcbfba044a08922c85752255597.jpg"><br><br><h3>  High conversion </h3><br>  According to one of the domestic ESP (we will not disclose which, in order not to advertise), the popup conversion is ~ 0.8%.  The remaining methods of collecting an average of ~ 0.5%.  Yes, popup strains, yes it appears before the page closes, yes, yes, yes.  But, again, from a business point of view, the number of emails collected in this way is higher than in other online ways. <br><br>  How to make so that the pop-up window was shown only during those moments when it is necessary?  There is no universal answer.  We'll have to test, like everything you do on the Internet.  Plus it's that simple.  Popups have many settings: <br><ol><li>  Show time.  In the third second, in the third minute. </li><li>  URL setting </li><li>  Trigger popup  Appears after the actions you defined.  For example, after a user has put two items in the basket or is about to leave the site. </li><li>  You can not show the pop-up to those who have already seen it or who have already signed. </li></ol><br>  All these settings are combined and make complex and effective schemes for the appearance of the popup very well.  For example, the user spent 5 minutes on the site, looked at 3 content articles - obviously, the material is interesting to him, and it‚Äôs time to show the subscription window with the offer to receive your articles by mail. <br><br>  I, like you, are very worried about users on the site and try to use the popup very carefully.  I didn‚Äôt find a super recipe, but with the help of tests I realized that if you want a lot of subscribers, you can show a popup even 5 seconds after entering the site.  The main thing that the message was potentially useful.  For example - ‚Äúleave your email and get 1000r to your bonus account‚Äù.  At this moment, the potential buyer will forget about the popup, he will already be thinking about a thousand rubles. <br><br>  There is another option popup, for those who are very worried about users.  Make a through label, by clicking on which the subscription form will appear.  Using this method, you can not be afraid for a drop in the depth of viewing and a large bounce rate. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9ea/cbc/0e7/9eacbc0e7ac34ed98c47e9bade72b27f.jpg"><br><br><h1>  2. Subscription page </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/daf/ad1/525/dafad15255f54feeb0a59b0840f1c998.jpg"><br>  <i>Sorry for such a vulgar example.</i> <br><br>  The second most effective tool after my popup in my rating is the subscription page.  Or landing page, yes, landing, just do not like this word.  Efficiency, first of all, is due to conversion - the whole page is devoted to one topic and one goal - to get an email.  It remains only to drive on this page quality traffic.  The page can live independently and as part of the site.  You can drive traffic from contextual advertising, from social networks and from anywhere. <br><br>  If you have something to give to users - offer this as a reward for their email - this will greatly increase the conversion.  A book, infographics, secret research or half a kilo of goji berries - everything will go to the good, depending on the subject.  People love gifts and give an email in exchange for something much easier than giving it for empty promises of wealth or weight loss. <br>  In general, use subscription pages if you cannot briefly describe the reason why you need a client email. <br><br><h1>  3. Topper </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b9c/c5b/030/b9cc5b030c4e414d851c51b9b1033197.jpg"><br><br>  Unlike popup, topper does not cover content with itself.  And at the same time, the topper is impossible not to notice.  And if it dynamically appears during a visit, then its visibility = 100%.  Topper conversion is lower than that of a popup.  And the speed of implementation is slightly lower.  For none of the ESP has such functionality, so you have to use third-party services.  List at the end of the article. <br><br><h1>  4. Just form on the site. </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e86/ea5/3e5/e86ea53e5a064cb383dadc8c8c8e033b.jpg"><br><br>  Just form on the site saw anyone who reads this text.  It is necessary to use it, the conversion will not be super, but the quality of such subscribers is high.  In addition, no annoying effects.  You can make it more visible, less visible.  Experiments will answer how best to do.  If you want more subscriptions - make the form more contrast, brighter.  If you want to distract the user from the content less - less noticeable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1f0/974/90f/1f097490f74848349fe275f27d0f09c4.jpg"><br>  <i>The day before yesterday, I noticed how mail.ru does.</i>  <i>If you are logged in, they immediately substitute your email in the subscription field, that is, it remains only to press the button.</i> <i><br></i> <br>  You can experiment with its display, test styles, button colors, captions for them.  There is no universal recipe - only tests. <br><br><h1>  5. Subscription to registration </h1><br><br>  Sign the user to the newsletter at the time of registration can and should be.  The main thing is to inform him about it.  I will highlight here 2 ways. <br>  Subscribe to checkout in the online store and just to register on any site, service, media or forum.  Email marketing, according to online store owners, is a favorite repeat sales tool.  And by signing a person who is already ready to give you money, you are more likely to secure a re-sale. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aa9/898/4b0/aa98984b0471444585ef08a636e578b7.jpg"><br><br><blockquote>  I often recall analytics from one of the largest retailers of household appliances.  Evaluated re-sales committed online.  What do you think, what product did the customers who bought the refrigerator buy?  The answer is at the end of the article. </blockquote><br>  To sign the user at the stage of completing the purchase, you only need to add a check mark with a description that you will send for the letters.  You can go a little further and immediately check this box and put it.  The main thing is to be able to remove it.  After registration and subscription, the most difficult thing remains - to send the user the letters to which he has subscribed.  Technically, checkout in the online store and registering on any portal or service is the same - a record with an email is created in your database.  Therefore, when subscribing to the registration stage, the same principles work.  Ask permissions and send those letters which the user allowed you. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b00/d30/c6b/b00d30c6b8bd465cbec08f63b5acf5d5.jpg"><br><br><h1>  6. Offline collection </h1><br>  Last in my rating method.  In absolute numbers, it is not the most efficient, even if you have a large customer flow.  But the quality of these subscribers will be the highest.  I will make a reservation, you can count on super loyal subscribers from offline only if you clearly let the client know why you are receiving an email.  I draw your attention to this because attracting someone offline costs a lot of money and if you ruin the relationship with a client with spam, you will lose the money you spent on attraction.  You can collect using paper questionnaires, using questionnaires of quality of service, I participated in the implementation of the subscription form in the contract of sale.  Your specialists may ask the client's email verbally.  I also like the email application, which can be installed on the iPad and given to the client, so that there are no errors when transferring emails to CRM, and then to ESP <br><br><h1>  Eventually </h1><br>  If you have not tried popup, go ahead and do it.  No matter how it will work at the very beginning.  With the help of tests and experiments, you will understand how best you and your users are. <br><br>  Do not forget about the gift, email - this is a repeat sale, which will pay back this gift very quickly.  If you have an online store, then there should be no excuse at all, be sure to popup with a gift. <br><br>  List of services for quick popup implementation <br><br>  Imported: <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://www.picreel.com/">www.picreel.com</a> - specialize only in pop-up at closing </li><li>  <a href="https://www.mailmunch.co/">www.mailmunch.co</a> - there are different forms, but a scant gallery of templates </li><li>  <a href="https://getsitecontrol.com/">getsitecontrol.com</a> is the same as mailmunch, but again there are few templates. </li><li>  <a href="http://wisepops.com/">wisepops.com</a> is the same as mailmunch, but again there are few templates </li><li>  <a href="https://mailchimp.com/">mailchimp.com</a> - mailing service with built-in collection tools </li><li>  <a href="http://hellobar.com/">hellobar.com</a> - Widget service.  Free, but need ESP. </li><li>  <a href="http://sumome.com/">sumome.com</a> - Like hellobar, but subjectively less beautiful.  There is also a ‚Äúsmart‚Äù popup.  The free version has few settings. </li></ul><br>  Our: <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://makedreamprofits.ru/">makedreamprofits.ru</a> - good pop with involvement (about this in the next article) </li><li>  <a href="http://witget.com/">witget.com</a> - email collection tools </li><li>  <a href="http://mailget.net/">mailget.net</a> is the same as witget </li><li>  <a href="https://mailganer.com/">mailganer.com</a> - mailing service with built-in collection tools </li></ul><br><br>  Write if anyone forgot. <br><br>  <i>By the way, the second item that was bought after the refrigerator was another refrigerator.</i>  <i>Cool, yeah?</i> <br><br>  And how do you collect subscribers? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298646/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298646/</a></p>
