It is common for users to quickly migrate from one application and service to another, and the client base can be maintained only by maintaining interaction with users throughout the entire service usage time.  At Wrike, we have developed several principles for communicating with customers in order to make communication more personalized and try to take it beyond regular sales.  More about them under the cut. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/85d/0b3/824/85d0b38240124c29b5800e195c225de2.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Quick response to feedback</b> <br>  Said already a million times, but still relevant.  It is especially important not to miss the case when the user himself wants to get in touch - forms for feedback must be accessible from different points and be visible.  If the only feedback form is hidden on the Contacts page, you will never receive most of the reviews or you will have to catch them from public user accounts on social networks (and the information may be negative).  In <a href="https://www.wrike.com/ru/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg%26utm_medium%3Dblogposts%26utm_campaign%3Dengaging_customers">Wrike,</a> users can leave feedback: <br><ul><li>  by link from anywhere in the service workspace, </li><li>  by responding to one of our letters, </li><li>  by writing directly to support and on social media pages that are integrated with the internal support service. </li></ul><br>  Regardless of the location of the request, they will receive an answer within one working day.  By the way, on Facebook, administrators can quickly check how quickly support responds to requests and whether everyone gets an answer right on the company's page. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/163/479/b88/163479b8879641b985e1168841fa227a.png" alt="image">

      Guaranteed response and a pronounced willingness to dialogue gives users confidence that their opinions are heard, and this is a textbook way to win loyalty.  Even if the problem addressed by the client cannot be solved in the near future, the support team can always prompt him for workarounds that will reduce his dissatisfaction.  By the way, we have already <a href="https://megamozg.ru/company/wrike/blog/23818/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg%26utm_medium%3Dblogposts%26utm_campaign%3Dengaging_customers">written</a> about how we form the support service. <br><br>  Not only are well-established collection and processing of requests, but also the fullest use of the data obtained is important.  In our case, the data obtained from the feedback initiate quick corrections of the most critical bugs, significantly affect the development priorities, and also allow us to understand where we left significant gaps in the user's training cycle.  Since we offer a service for project management in a team, high-quality training in working with it plays a key minimizing user outflow at the initial stage. <br><br>  <b>Identifying brand advocates</b> <br>  Loyal customers serve as the basis for creating a strong community around the brand, which will influence the perception of the product by other users (and potential buyers) much more than a dozen PR-managers, besieging journalists in full-time mode.  After a certain time after registering an account, we offer users to answer the question ‚ÄúHow likely are you ready to recommend Wrike to someone else?‚Äù On a scale from 1 to 10. This is a classic <a href="http://www.netpromotersystem.com/about/measuring-your-net-promoter-score.aspx">Net Promoter Score</a> test that allows you to understand product satisfaction, but we are not interested only statistics.  Users who ranged from 8 to 10, we invite you to join our <a href="http://club.wrike.com/community/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg%26utm_medium%3Dblogposts%26utm_campaign%3Dengaging_customers">Wrike Club</a> . <br><br>  The club is, first of all, a community where users can share experiences and tips on using the system (which, again, is very much in demand for corporate services) and be the first to test the beta versions of the new functionality.  We also try to receive feedback and work on increasing loyalty.  For example, community members are invited to perform tasks - for example, take a survey and share their impressions about the updated notification function on Android.  The most active members of the club receive gifts from us to choose from - discount cards and certificates to various online stores, coffee shops, etc.  Since only loyal users are initially selected to the club, we don‚Äôt disturb others with our requests and get a high percentage of responses. <br><br>  <b>Expert information about the problem</b> <br>  Everyone who uses your service or application has some need or problem that they are trying to solve with your help.  If people find that you are not coping well or fully, careful attention to their requests will not stop users from leaving.  In the case of Wrike, customers are concerned about how to effectively organize workflows in a team, therefore, in addition to the service, we provide unique information on this topic in various forms.  First of all, this is the <a href="https://www.wrike.com/blog/ru/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg%26utm_medium%3Dblogposts%26utm_campaign%3Dengaging_customers">Wrike blog</a> in several languages ‚Äã‚Äãwith posts on productivity, project management and collaboration, the best posts from which are sent as a weekly digest.  One of the favorite visual and interactive forms of communication for our users became webinars on how to better organize the work of the team. <br><br>  Finally, on the basis of surveys of a large part of our user base, we began to issue reports on the main problems faced by teams in the workplace.  So, recently we issued reports on the <a href="https://www.wrike.com/ru/work-management-report-2015/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg%26utm_medium%3Dblogposts%26utm_campaign%3Dengaging_customers">organization of work</a> and the <a href="https://www.wrike.com/ru/library/ebooks/mobile-productivity-report-2016/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg%26utm_medium%3Dblogposts%26utm_campaign%3Dengaging_customers">impact of mobile devices on productivity</a> , which may be of interest to a wide range of managers and employees. <br><br>  This content has a reactivation potential.  Useful information forces us to return to our site, including those customers who, for some reason (change of employment, for example) have stopped using the service, keeping their attention. <br><br>  <b>Fair exchange</b> <br>  The principle of fair exchange works in all respects.  Therefore, if we want to ask our customers about something, first we offer them something in return.  For example, Wrike long ago introduced the practice of providing free accounts to charitable organizations and student teams.  About the most interesting projects, we then create success stories.  In addition, as mentioned, Wrike often conducts surveys among users, offering in exchange a discount on a subscription or gift. <br><br>  We hope our experience will help you deal with the outflow of the audience more successfully, and we, in turn, are looking forward to your recommendations on this topic. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299586/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299586/</a></p>
