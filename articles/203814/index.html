We will understand what distinguishes the reader in 2013 from the model of one and a half years ago. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b3c/c4f/3f5/b3cc4f3f5091402085b216d14ab8aed0.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h6>  Visual differences. </h6><br>  A box of new items to match the "reader": now framed in white and gray tones and has become even more compact.  The manufacturer finally removed the charging from the network - there is only a usb-cord.  The reader himself changed not only the color of the case, but also became a bit thinner (the height and width parameter remained the same), but lost its distinctive features: mechanical buttons and memory card support (of the 4 GB of internal memory, 500 MB are actually available to the user) .  The branded power button moved from the back of the device to the side, and the edging was rubberized.  The mounting holes for the original covers have also disappeared, so that only Chinese copies covering the entire book on the contour are suitable for the new Glowlight.  But the Nook weighs only 175 grams (against 212 from its older brother).

      If we compare the reader now released with the old model, we can say that in the convenience of holding with one hand (without the cover) the novelty loses to the previous generation, where there was a characteristic depression on the back. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a19/689/ff6/a19689ff627fa10c4d8d0bea571c53e4.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bf6/5ce/8b8/bf65ce8b864d75b0414bd2759b7a42ed.jpg"><br><br>  <i>(It is worth noting that the bezel that passes around the contour does not look quite aesthetically pleasing because it does not evenly adhere to the plastic base everywhere. In addition, now getting into / connecting to the micro-usb jack is more problematic).</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a2b/18e/0af/a2b18e0af07f19b5be487b8759cb9445.jpg"><br><br><h6>  Functionality. </h6><br>  After switching on (to our joy, the device was not recharged beforehand) the ‚Äúbook‚Äù routinely asks for registration via Wi-Fi.  Unfortunately, the old trick, when, by quickly turning off the wireless connection, it was possible to avoid downloading a whole package of promotional books, it did not work here.  Expected, Nook-a new firmware (numbered 1.3.0).  The visual content of the "reading room" has slightly changed, but the overall "picture" of the possibility of action remains the same.  The only (except for turning on) mechanical button in the form of a "horseshoe" throws us to the reader's home page, where in the lower area there are only three icons that are narrow in height: Library (Library), Shop (Store) and Search (Search).  To go to the settings, you need to get to the upper right area, after which you will be able to turn on the wireless connection, activate the backlight or go to the full settings mode (the appearance and functionality of which remained unchanged). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e5d/a5a/3c1/e5da5a3c1289a7806643e4ebc96d9c9f.jpg"><br><br>  Program settings for reading also remained virtually intact: you can still make bookmarks and notes, navigate through the number of pages or chapters.  The selection of fonts is slightly changed. <br><br>  <i>(Let's say that the old version with the ‚Äúsettings‚Äù icon after clicking ‚Äúhorseshoe‚Äù wins in the convenience and speed of movement.</i> <br>  <i>The selection of fonts in this version of the firmware was liked less than it was in 1.2.1.</i>  <i>Most likely - a matter of habit and taste.)</i> <i><br></i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ab0/e1b/5d4/ab0e1b5d44501fc33df0105f0806ec17.jpg"><br><br><h6>  The speed of work, drawing, lighting. </h6><br>  Navigating and turning pages when reading a new product is faster than before (this is not very noticeable at first glance, but when comparing the two versions of the reader, the difference becomes very noticeable).  One can also feel the difference in the shade of ‚Äúwhiteness‚Äù of the page background: in the new version of Glowlight it slightly gives off yellowness and looks a bit darker than the light gray of the old version.  Not to say that increasing the screen resolution plays a significant role here (now the ratio of the number of pixels is 758 x 1024), although, of course, it‚Äôs not difficult to notice more clarity when you look closely.  The changes also affected the drawing of pages.  Now the reader does not ‚Äúfill in‚Äù the screen completely (there is no characteristic blinking of the screen every sixth time), but draws evenly without ‚Äúhops‚Äù;  at the same time, there are no ‚Äútraces‚Äù from the previous pages. <br><br>  If there is something to boast of the white version of Glowlight, so it is backlit.  The diodes are still located on top (they are easy to see), but everything looks much more even and whiter (the old Nook has a bluish backlight).  The brightness level at the same time became much higher (approximately at the level of the second-generation Kindle Paperwhite). <br><br>  <i>(Note that in the model under test, the diode located on the right, when tilted, for some reason became visible faster than the others - it looks like a small marriage.)</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/232/3e8/1ce/2323e81ce13cf619af5bf8dcedd4b5b1.jpg"><br><br><h5>  Total </h5><br>  The impression of the only Nook released in 2013 is largely predictable.  Trying to make the ‚Äúproduct‚Äù as thin and light as possible, Barnes &amp; Noble left us without favorite side buttons, a useful slot for memory cards, moved the proprietary power button, but at the same time improved the speed of the ‚Äúreader‚Äù and presented a backlight that could compete with other manufacturers.  It is hardly worth changing the previous generation Glowlight to a fresh one, but when considering the option of buying a new device for yourself, there is something to think about;  Often, the Nook was claimed by the consumer, precisely because of the root access capabilities, which in the new model may not appear, and without it, it will not be possible to fully access the Internet or open a pirated .fb2. <br><br>  PS I will be glad to questions, there is an opportunity to compare the Nook with the majority of modern readers.  Write in the comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/203814/">https://habr.com/ru/post/203814/</a></p>
