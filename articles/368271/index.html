This time, so that you don‚Äôt feel bored during the New Year holidays, we want to share the <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/ilyaabilov/" class="user_link">tweeters</a> from <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/ilyaabilov/" class="user_link">IlyaAbilov</a> , the founder of the <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/vertdider/">Vert Dider</a> popular science voicing studio dedicated to the popularization of science.  Under the cut of his story, you can find a lot of interesting things there, if you want to expand your scientific knowledge and horizons. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  At first, perhaps, about the twitter of major popular science projects. <br><br>  For example, it will certainly be useful for the Russian-speaking public to know about <b>Popular Mechanics</b> ( <a href="https://twitter.com/PopMechanica">Popmechanica</a> ), a popular science journal that has been published in Russian for quite some time.

      <b>Obrazovach</b> ( <a href="https://twitter.com/obrazovach">Obrazovach</a> ) - our friends, a young, but very vigorous project dedicated to scientific topics. <br><br>  <b>Simple Science</b> ( <a href="https://twitter.com/SimpleScienceRU">SimpleScienceRu</a> ) shoots short videos in which various physical and chemical experiments are conducted.  And they are also releasing a series of books "Simple Science". <br><br>  For those who do not have problems with the English language, on Twitter is incomparably more exciting. <br><br>  <b>Nature</b> ( <a href="https://twitter.com/nature">nature</a> ) is a world-famous scientific journal in which you can find news from various fields of science. <br><br>  <b>Phys.org</b> ( <a href="https://twitter.com/physorg_com">physorg_com</a> ) is a resource dedicated to the news of physics, cosmonautics, biology, chemistry, engineering, mathematics, electronics, nanotechnology, and many other scientific disciplines. <br><br>  <b>National Geographic</b> ( <a href="https://twitter.com/NatGeo">NatGeo</a> ) is a well-known popular science project that includes a printed magazine and various video products. <br><br>  On twitter <b>Guardian Science</b> ( <a href="https://twitter.com/guardianscience">GuardianScience</a> ) you can find news of science, medicine and the environment. <br><br>  If we talk about other important initiatives and projects in my opinion, I cannot but mention <b>TED</b> ( <a href="https://twitter.com/TEDTalks">TED Talks</a> , <a href="https://twitter.com/TED_ED">TED-Ed</a> ) - an educational project built on regular presentations by scientists and specialists, each of which talks about amazing and interesting phenomena, discoveries, research and inventions. <br><br>  One of the perhaps most memorable lectures at TED was ‚ÄúHugh Herr - Bionic Prostheses‚Äù.  Many who watched it in their eyes literally tears dimmed when they saw the wonders of modern bionics.  <b>Hugh Herr</b> works in one of the MIT Media Lab divisions.  He has his own account ( <a href="https://twitter.com/hughherr">HughHerr</a> ), and on Twitter you can follow the work of his project <a href="https://twitter.com/MyBiOM">Biom</a> ( <a href="https://twitter.com/MyBiOM">MyBiOM</a> ). <br><br>  By the way, in <b>Media Lab</b> , one of the many laboratories at the University of Massachusetts, various high-tech developments are concentrated, and you can also follow it on Twitter ( <a href="https://twitter.com/medialab">MediaLab</a> ). <br><br>  Separately, it is necessary to mention the space theme. <br><br>  <b>NASA Technology</b> ( <a href="https://twitter.com/NASA_Technology">NASA_Technology</a> ) talk about new technologies in space technology. <br><br>  <b>ESA Science</b> ( <a href="https://twitter.com/esascience">ESAScience</a> ) is one of the accounts of the European Space Agency.  They talk about the news of science, which are published by their employees, scientists. <br><br>  <b>Live! Universe</b> ( <a href="https://twitter.com/DrMichaelVideos">DrMichaelVideos</a> ) is a ‚Äúlive universe‚Äù, a very good blogger, he specializes in space. <br><br>  There are still some interesting people that many may seem worthy of attention. <br><br>  For example, <b>Chris Anderson</b> ( <a href="https://twitter.com/TEDchris">TEDchris</a> ), TED Manager and Executive Director of the TED Foundation.  He has many very interesting speeches.  And he has a very interesting twitter, because he, as the main director of TED, communicates with the coolest speakers from all over the world.  In his twitter you can just find all those whom you have been looking for.  When a new decent lecturer appears on TED, Chris is sure to tell what he is doing and what ideas he is promoting. <br><br>  <b>Hans Rosling</b> ( <a href="https://twitter.com/HansRosling">HansRosling</a> ).  One of the TED lecturers, two of his lectures are in the TOP-20.  One of them is Religions and Children, where he says that religiosity only indirectly affects the birth rate.  That is, the main factors are the economy, child mortality, etc.  Very interesting speaker. <br><br>  <b>Marco Tempest</b> ( <a href="https://twitter.com/virtualmagician">VirtualMagician</a> ) is also a well-known TED speaker, a professional magician.  Performs with various presentations, he does it great. <br><br>  <b>Jim Al-Khalili</b> ( <a href="https://twitter.com/jimalkhalili">JimAlKhalili</a> ) - a famous presenter who starred in the films BBC, National Geographic, etc.  This is a fairly large blogger, one of those with whom we are trying to cooperate.  When we wrote to him that we, as a non-profit association, translated some of his works, he, of course, very warmly thanked us for the work and praised our translation, but I do not advise him that at all.  ;) <br><br>  Another host, starring in the BBC and National Geographic, <b>Brian Cox</b> ( <a href="https://twitter.com/ProfBrianCox">ProfBrianCox</a> ), talks about space and physics.  He himself is an expert in particle physics.  If I'm not mistaken, he works at CERN. <br><br>  <b>Daniel Pink</b> ( <a href="https://twitter.com/DanielPink">DanielPink</a> ) is a cognitive psychologist.  He has a very cool lecture, she is in the TOP-20 of the most popular TED lectures on motivation.  He argues that money is not the main motivator for creative activity. <br><br>  <b>Brian Goldman</b> ( <a href="https://twitter.com/NightShiftMD">NightShiftMD</a> ) is a doctor who specializes in evidence-based medicine and struggles with charlatans. <br><br>  <b>Stephen Pinker</b> ( <a href="https://twitter.com/sapinker">SaPinker</a> ) - an interesting American scientist and popularizer of science, working at Harvard.  Specializes in the field of cognitive sciences, he has a number of interesting publications about the language. <br><br>  <b>Bill Nye</b> ( <a href="https://twitter.com/TheScienceGuy">TheScienceGuy</a> ) - popularization scientist.  He still has a very funny pseudonym "science guy" - like "learned guy."  He is already in old age, but he really behaves like a teenager.  Always very active.  And the main audience with which he works are children.  They are delighted with him, because he does not put himself above them and understands everything with them, as if for the first time. <br><br>  Director <b>Luke Holverda</b> ( <a href="https://twitter.com/lukeiswho">LukeIsWho</a> ), who shot the film ‚ÄúThe unbelievers‚Äù (‚ÄúUnbelievers‚Äù), which we presented last year in Moscow, St. Petersburg and in several other cities. <br><br>  <b>Row Reynolds</b> ( <a href="https://twitter.com/RouReynolds">RouReynolds</a> ) is the lead singer of the music group ENTER SHIKARI, he releases a podcast where he talks about science, among other things. <br><br>  A couple more popularizers of science: <b>Brian Green</b> ( <a href="https://twitter.com/bgreene">BGreene</a> ), an astrophysicist, several books of which were translated into Russian, and <b>Michio Kaku</b> , who starred in a huge number of films of National Geographic and BBC. <br><br>  <b>Sergey Lupashin</b> ( <a href="https://twitter.com/UntitledTitles">UntitledTitles</a> ) is one of the Russian developers of the team creating quadrocopters.  They received a grant to work in Switzerland.  He was born, as I understand it, not in Russia.  Works on algorithms for robo kites. <br><br>  I will also mention <b>Geek Sputnik</b> ( <a href="https://twitter.com/GeekSputnikTV">GeekSputnikTV</a> ), a video podcast twitter about interesting updates in the world of the Internet and gadgets.  He is led by one of our friends who lives in New York, but works for the Russian audience. <br><br>  We are engaged not only in the popularization of science, but also in common sense, and therefore I would like to recommend following on Twitter some resources and people connected with the struggle for the latter. <br><br>  Michael Shermer's <b>Skeptic Magazine</b> ( <a href="https://twitter.com/TheSkepticMag">TheSkepticMag</a> ), which specializes in skepticism, critical reviews of various pseudoscientific articles and other quackery.  <b>Michael Shermer</b> <a href="https://twitter.com/michaelshermer">himself</a> has a lot of different projects.  For example, the Society of Skeptics (Skeptic Society), which was formed in the 1990s in America - just it publishes the magazine Skeptic Magazine.  Shermer also gives lectures, his subjects are cognitive distortions, the reasons why people believe charlatans. <br><br>  <b>Atheist TV</b> ( <a href="https://twitter.com/Atheist_TV">Atheist_TV</a> ) is the first atheistic television in the world.  It appeared in the United States last year and has been broadcasting various old podcasts that Atheists of America and other communities have saved for 10 years.  Plus, some new programs also appear. <br><br>  Many different presidents have now settled on Twitter, and this trend has not bypassed President of the American Society of Atheists <b>David Silverman</b> ( <a href="https://twitter.com/MrAtheistPants">MrAististPants</a> ). <br><br>  <b>Richard Dawkins</b> , social activist and popularizer of science, ethologist, evolutionary biologist, is very, very well known.  There is no particular need to say what he does, but nonetheless I note that he adheres to anti-clericalism and promotes atheism. <br><br>  <b>Lawrence Krauss</b> ( <a href="https://twitter.com/LKrauss1">LKrauss1</a> ) is a physicist, he has a very cool lecture, the book Universe of Nothing.  Public atheist and the main person in the film "Unbelievers" ( <a href="https://twitter.com/unbelieversfilm">UnbelieversFilm</a> ).  By the way, Richard Dawkins and Lawrence Kraus travel the world and tell you what religion is bad for. <br><br>  Another famous person, American skeptic <b>Brian Dunning</b> ( <a href="https://twitter.com/BrianDunning">BrianDunning</a> ).  He publishes films and books on skepticism and analysis of pseudoscientific directions. <br><br>  <b>Adam Savage</b> ( <a href="https://twitter.com/donttrythis">DontTryThis</a> ), popularizer of science, myth destroyer, drama, and public atheist. <br><br>  <b>Penn Gillette</b> ( <a href="https://twitter.com/pennjillette">PennJillette</a> ), a famous magician.  He still has a show - in Russian translation is called "Bullshit."  It has already been 8 seasons, each with 13 episodes.  They do reviews of everything, from political laws, such as a ban on smoking and prostitution, to the communities of some spiritualists and eco-activists who engage in terrorism.  Worth a look. <br><br>  <b>Patton Oswalt</b> and <a href="https://twitter.com/daraobriain">DaraOBriain</a> are comedians who are also seen in ridiculing every anti-scientific nonsense. <br><br>  <b>Bill Mar</b> ( <a href="https://twitter.com/billmaher">BillMaher</a> ).  American comedian.  He has a show where he invites different personalities and criticizes, even if he agrees with them. <br><br>  <b>Sam Harris</b> ( <a href="https://twitter.com/SamHarrisOrg">SamHarrisORG</a> ) - a public atheist, the author of many books, including "The End of Faith", "Falsity", "Freedom of the Will".  His ‚Äúfavorite‚Äù subject is a moral issue without religion. <br><br>  <b>Daniel Dennett</b> ( <a href="https://twitter.com/danieldennett">DanielDennett</a> ), a living modern philosopher, cognitive psychologist, author of books, a publicist.  And also, accordingly, a public atheist.  He has an interesting look at the question of organizing a world without religion and how to come to this world. <br><br>  Finally, I mention <b>Pat</b> <a href="https://twitter.com/patcondell">Condella</a> ( <a href="https://twitter.com/patcondell">PatCondell</a> ), some of the videos that we translated.  He mainly produces short 3-4 minute videos criticizing religion and politics.  He often speaks about Islam, in connection with which he receives a mass of threats that he does not hide from the public. <br><br>  Well, I really, really, really recommend to subscribe to our brainchild, <b>Skeptic's Dictionary</b> ( <a href="https://twitter.com/skepdic_ru">SkepDic_ru</a> ) (Twitter is still silent, but I hope we will fix it soon), where you can find a lot of useful things, if the topic is critical thinking, skepticism and sound any sense of touch. <br><br>  Instead of an epilogue.  We try to spread the influence of science and interest people in it, and for this our studio is engaged in translation and dubbing of commercials.  These are both short TED Education videos and TED performances.  And just some videos from YouTube, some even shot on the phone.  The heroes of our videos are charismatic, able to communicate their thoughts and ideas brightly and fascinatingly.  In Russia, unfortunately, the culture of the speaker is not developed, so we are only translating.  I hope that this will change, and popularization of science will come to us.  Now the need for this is very high, so people are happy to watch even translations.  Although there are those who require subtitles.  ‚ÄúWhy was it even transferred?  I want to watch the original.  For you, my little fighters for the English audio track, we have a link to the original below each video. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/368271/">https://habr.com/ru/post/368271/</a></p>
