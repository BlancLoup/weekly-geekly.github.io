Moreover, this is a multi-level movement: while the completely new architecture of the computer systems The Machine (the so-called memory-centric architecture) is being forged, we understand that we need to accelerate now.  Let's see what we can do today and what HPE will have tomorrow.  Hint - we will talk about a strong acceleration of our 3PAR and Nimble storage systems using smart and budget caching on the Storage Class Memory (SCM) in the form of Intel Optane. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  First, we establish the boundaries of the problem under study.  In this post, we are not interested in high performance computing with its own specifics and are not interested in tasks requiring exclusively intra-server fast storage.  The latter are undoubtedly also a topic for Intel Optane and SCM in general, but such tasks are often specific, poorly amenable to virtualization and, therefore, consolidation.  We‚Äôll talk about tasks and applications that get along well with external 3PAR, Nimble or MSA class storage systems (although we‚Äôre not going to touch MSA either). <br><br>  So, how can you improve the performance of a virtualized application that works with data on an external storage system: <br><ul><li>  See what the app is holding back now.  Perhaps it‚Äôs not at all in the storage system, but in anticipation of the processor, in the internal logic of working with data, in suboptimally written queries; </li><li>  if there are large delays on the part of data waiting (IO), then first it is worth checking whether all recommendations for configuring the application-OS drivers have been followed (SCSI, HBA, etc.) </li><li>  possible deal in the SAN network (Ethernet, FC); </li><li>  Perhaps it's all the same in the storage system.  Where in storage?  In the controller's hardware (what's with the cache, what is the CPU usage), in the controller's OS and drivers, in the data bus, in the disks ... </li></ul><br>  Possible course of thought: Oh, sure - the wheels!  Everything else is difficult and you do not want to touch, but with the disks we will try.  What we have, a hybrid - well, it means you need all-flash.  Do we have all-flash?  What is better?  We look advertising respected brands:

    <div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dc/ig/q7/dcigq7iuujylprrygydh_0xbhla.png" alt="image"></div><br>  Everything is clear, we take storage with "NVMe-disks".  Wait, <b>how</b> much?  And I need to buy a <b>new</b> storage system, I can not upgrade my current one?  Well, it should be so ... <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0fc/a1a/91d/0fca1a91df15114fad6d015ff1a3aa56.gif" alt="image"></div><br>  Is it possible in another way after all?  We at HPE believe that it is not only possible, but necessary.  And that's why: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fx/np/rv/fxnprvk019rj4pwqquoqc2yhrca.png" alt="image"></div><br>  The fact is that most NVMe SSDs on the market right now are the same type of media, NAND-flash, only connected to the controller not by Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) protocol, but by the new NVMe protocol.  The new protocol is no doubt beautiful, and here are some facts: <br><br><ul><li>  64,000 queues available with 64,000 threads each - IOPS above the roof </li><li>  controller directly in the CPU - lower CPU load </li><li>  each processor core sees each SSD directly - low latency </li></ul><br><br>  With a complete replacement of the SCSI protocol all the way from the application to the disks, it is possible to significantly reduce access latency.  But what do marketers offer us today?  "NVMe disks".  Those.  the entire chain to the storage controller itself remains the same - SCSI.  And then the controller simply repackages the SCSI in NVMe and so it communicates with the connected NAND SSD. <br><br>  The result on the graph above is the minimum gain in delay.  Although the gain on peak IOPS can really be very noticeable.  The traditional analogy: do you need a car that can accelerate quickly for overtaking in 5 seconds, or a car that in ideal conditions can accelerate to 300 km / h in 10 minutes?  Both options are good, but more often they choose the first one. <br><br>  The reality is that the gain from NVMe NAND today is hardly noticeable for real applications, and in our opinion it‚Äôs not at all worth the difference in price and loss in available capacity compared to SAS SSD. <br><br>  What HPE offers instead of simply replacing the ‚Äúlast mile‚Äù from SAS to NVMe - using brand new Intel Optane drives connected via NVMe as a read cache in the controllers of our 3PAR and Nimble storage systems. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xu/li/vk/xulivkci2dqatabrok2n7vnwzio.png" alt="image"></div><br>  <i>(Both the adding machine and the admin in the photo are called Felix, but the difference is huge!)</i> <br><br>  Why we decided to go this route: <br><br><ul><li>  so we can offer our customers to upgrade the already purchased storage systems (specifically 3PAR 9450, 20450, 20850 and Nimble AF60 and AF80 - all top all-flash) <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/u5/wz/dl/u5wzdlhs2_wb2lyalb1phbaprpi.jpeg" alt="image"></div></li><li>  at the same time, in a very simple way (adding an expansion card with Optane on board to each controller), we reduce the maximum delay by about 15 times, and the average delay - by 30-40% (IOPS also grow, but oh well).  And most importantly, the delay does not jump from marketing " <b>from</b> 0.2 ms!"  ad infinitum (marketing is not ours, just quoting), but it becomes much more stable: <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ee/4t/u_/ee4tu_cfntaw66z8sb6pupdnx_o.png" alt="image"></div><br>  <i>(Delays based on HPE internal tests)</i> </li><li>  more specifically, what can be expected from such a decrease in the delay on the array for your favorite Oracle, for example: according to our internal tests, the IO wait is reduced by an average of 37%, and the execution of SQL selects is accelerated by 27%. </li><li>  Why is the cache read and not write?  Because both in 3PAR and Nimble for many years, DRAM is used as a write cache (in the case of Nimble, non-volatile NVRAM).  It, in turn, is many times faster than NVMe devices, and until the advent of Gen-Z or similar new protocols will remain so.  Those.  write speed through NVMe is not necessary. </li><li>  Why Intel Optane?  Because it is the newest type of carrier, albeit lagging behind NAND in density, but an order of magnitude faster than the response.  Plus, Optane has an almost inexhaustible resource for rewriting.  In general, for loaded systems, the transaction cost on Optane is much lower than on NAND NVMe.  And the cache is a layer very loaded from all directions.  Hot data is copied to it from a slower layer (therefore, a resource is needed), it is read from it if data is not found in the controller's NVRAM cache (therefore, a fast response is needed so that going beyond the NVRAM cache does not look like a trip to the hypermarket compared to with going to the convenience store). </li><li>  why not to put NVMe-disks all the same?  Be sure to put!  For example, the Nimble chassis allows the installation of such disks now (the backplane is ready for this), but we are not selling such disks for Nimble yet, because it's early.  SCM-cache now gives multiple performance gains for relative pennies.  So let's use it while NVMe NAND still has a lot to get cheaper, the NVMe protocol itself is still evolving (multi-pathing appeared in the standard only in March 2018, and still lags far behind the stability of SCSI), and the whole NVMe ecosystem from application to disk still undeveloped (NVMe over fabric went to kindergarten, manufacturers argue about how it should look, drivers have minimal functionality, so as not to overwrite too much when everything is fixed). </li><li>  Well, also because we love to cache everything.  Here for example about Nimble: </li></ul><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ra/xh/v3/raxhv31dou-uchvgyubrwwu3usm.png" alt="image"></div><br>  <a href="https://habr.com/company/hpe/blog/329202/">By the</a> way, are you familiar with <a href="https://habr.com/company/hpe/blog/329202/">HPE InfoSight</a> ?  With this tool you always know where to look for the delay.  For example, like this: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xt/bz/ni/xtbzniulhurmg44yndks4qpr3kw.png" alt="image"></div><br>  <i>(For those who have found a delay, please contact us.)</i> <br><br>  It's time to sum up: if you are the proud owner of a 3PAR 9000 or 20,000, then you can order a 3PAR 3D Cache based on Intel Optane right now.  If you are looking at the array Nimble All-flash - take, because  it is a reliable base to protect investments in the future.  Start with SAS NAND SSD now, connect the All Flash Turbo-cache based on SCM later, then change the drives to NVMe. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xq/uo/cg/xquocgeacjpnl2zqfmkttpkhjhc.png" alt="3PAR and Nimble SCM cache"></div><br>  For reference: <br><ul><li>  here's a recent Nimble webinar: <a href="https://gateway.on24.com/wcc/gateway/elitehpeemeademandgen/1474757/1863633/Razvitie-HPE-Nimble-zashita-dannyh-urovnya-paranoid-i-drugie-novinki/%3FisSocialSharing%3DY%26partnerref%3DemailShareFromGateway">HPE Nimble Development: paranoid + data protection and other new features</a> </li><li>  and here is a webinar about Intel Optane in the HPE portfolio: <a href="https://gateway.on24.com/wcc/gateway/elitehpeemeademandgen/1474757/1805877/Optaneovoe-chislo-povyshaem-moshnost-vashego-COD-s-tehnologiyam-Intel/%3FisSocialSharing%3DY%26partnerref%3DemailShareFromGateway">Optane number - we increase the power of your data center with Intel technologies</a> . </li><li>  Post-based blog of the leader of the battle wing Nimble: <a href="http://recoverymonkey.org/2018/11/30/hpe-memory-driven-architectures-extend-to-3par-and-nimble-storage/">recoverymonkey.org/2018/11/30/hpe-memory-driven-architectures-extend-to-3par-and-nimble-storage</a> . </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/432306/">https://habr.com/ru/post/432306/</a></p>
