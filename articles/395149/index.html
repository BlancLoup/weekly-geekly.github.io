At the moment, a number of well-known <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/259460/">scientists</a> and scientific <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/232093/">organizations have</a> confirmed the performance of EmDrive.  The engine is a system consisting of a resonator (metal truncated cone) and a magnetron.  The engine is working, it is a fact.  How?  Such a system somehow creates cravings under the influence of electromagnetic radiation.  There are several hypotheses explaining the emergence of thrust.  So far, no hypothesis has been proven.  The <a href="http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/journal/adva/6/6/10.1063/1.4953807">Finnish scientists proposed their</a> own explanation of the principle of EmDrive operation this month.

      In their opinion, the formation of thrust in this system is explained by a certain type of wave interference, namely, destructive interference.  By constructive interference, we mean this type of combination of reflected waves at resonance, when the waves amplify each other.  In the case of destructive interference, the maxima of some waves fall at the minima of others, while there is no resonance.  If we are talking about the waves on the water, then with destructive interference they overlap each other, and the surface of the water looks calm. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  We can give another example, with electrons.  Thus, the interference of Raman electron transitions of various degrees of nonlinearity is destructive. <br><br><h3>  And where are the photons? </h3><br>  According to the physicists from Finland, in the resonator of this engine from a large number of all particles there are pairs of photons that are in antiphase with each other.  Such pairs, <a href="http://www.sciencealert.com/new-paper-claims-that-the-em-drive-doesn-t-defy-newton-s-3rd-law-after-all">scientists believe</a> , carry the impulse away in the direction opposite to the movement of the engine.  The interaction of these photons leads to the appearance of an electromagnetic wave with zero polarization.  But the impulse still transfers this wave. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe principle of operation of the EmDrive can be compared to the principle of operation of a jet engine of an aircraft, when gases moving in one direction push the aircraft in the opposite direction,‚Äù said Arto Annila, a team of Finnish scientists.  ‚ÄúMicrowave radiation is the fuel that goes to the resonator ... and the emDrive thrust is generated by pairs of photons.  When two photons move together, but have opposite phases, then this pair does not have an electromagnetic field, therefore, it will not be reflected from the metal walls, but leaves. ‚Äù <br><br>  According to researchers, the engine arises under the influence of waves whose length is not a multiple of the distance between the walls of the resonator.  This is possible only if the resonator is asymmetric.  If it were completely symmetrical, then the craving would not have arisen.  In the case of EmDrive, thrust will manifest itself with any asymmetric configuration.  It is likely that the efficiency of the engine depends on both the power of the microwave source and the material of the EmDrive resonator, as well as its shape.  And this dependence is nonlinear. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ba8/d89/22e/ba8d8922ee016b435a79aae773cfb637.jpg" height="489" width="801"><br><br>  The Finns emphasize that their idea is just an assumption, as well as the hypotheses of their colleagues who tried to explain the principle of EmDrive before.  Physicists from Finland are hoping that engineers will be able to create test systems to test their theory of pair photons.  To do this, you also need a device called an interferometer.  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2598%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D1%2584%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D1%2580">An interferometer</a> is a measuring instrument whose action is based on the phenomenon of interference.  The principle of operation of the interferometer is as follows: a beam of electromagnetic radiation (light, radio waves, etc.) using a particular device is spatially divided into two or more coherent beams.  Each of the beams passes through various optical paths and is directed to the screen, creating an interference pattern, from which one can determine the phase difference of the interfering beams at a given point in the picture. <br><br><h3>  More photons </h3><br>  I also note that in April, the physicist Mike McCulloch from the University of Plymouth tried to link the work of EmDrive with the interaction of photons.  Makaloh proposes to explain the principle of the engine using <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25AD%25D1%2584%25D1%2584%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582_%25D0%25A3%25D0%25BD%25D1%2580%25D1%2583">the Unruh effect</a> .  This effect was named after the physicist Bill Unruh, who discovered it in 1976.  He showed that understanding vacuum depends on the type of movement of an observer through space-time.  For example, if a stationary observer is in a vacuum, then in the case of acceleration, this observer will see around him a multitude of particles that are in thermodynamic equilibrium.  In other words, one can speak about vacuum only with respect to a certain object.  At the same time, inertia, according to Mahaloch, is the pressure of thermal radiation on an accelerating body.  At low accelerations, the Unruh radiation waves <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/274725/">exceed the size of the</a> entire Universe, which suggests quantization of inertia. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rbf7735o3hQ%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhowEVr0NEbHQAFnwSsViIwaxjL2Q" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The theory is somewhat unusual, but in addition to the principle of operation of EmDrive, it explains another effect ‚Äî <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D1%2591%25D1%2582%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">transitory anomalies</a> .  The transit anomaly is an unexpected increase in energy during the gravitational maneuvers of spacecraft near the Earth.  This anomaly was observed as Doppler frequency drift in the S-band and X-band and long-distance telemetry. <br><br>  So, Makalokh suggested that photons have inertial mass.  The photons are reflected inside the EmDrive body, therefore, they experience inertia.  The wavelengths of the Unruh radiation in this case are very small, their size is comparable to the size of the engine block.  If the wider part of the cone can accommodate Unruh waves that do not fit in the narrow part of the resonator, then the inertia of the photons that are reflected must change.  And to save momentum, the system creates cravings.  According to the author of this theory, it is consistent with the values ‚Äã‚Äãof thrust, which were obtained in experiments. <br><br>  You can test both the Finnish theory and the Englishman's theory experimentally by conducting a series of tests with EmDrive.  And if it turns out that it is the photons that create the ‚Äúimpossible‚Äù engine, this will allow technologists to create an EmDrive with a different form of resonator, which will create more engine thrust. <br><br>  <b>What does this mean for astronautics?</b>  Significant reduction in spacecraft flight time.  For example, New Horizons with EmDrive could get to Pluto in just 18 months instead of 9 years.  If EmDrive is able to scale, then a flight to the nearest stars instead of hundreds and thousands of years could take only a few dozen years.  This, of course, is also a lot, but more real. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/395149/">https://habr.com/ru/post/395149/</a></p>
