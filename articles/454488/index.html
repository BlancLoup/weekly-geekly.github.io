The dream of a society of universal prosperity, justice and equal opportunities, a society of care and the full development of each person.  A society where everyone is important and necessary, a society of love and cooperation between people. </p><br><p>  Is it possible to build such a society on our planet, full of war, suffering, poverty, inequality, the exploitation of man by man?  On a planet where the 8 richest people are richer than the 3.5 billion poor? </p><br><p><a name="habracut"></a>  Maybe you consider me a naive idealist, but I am sure that it is possible to build such a society and today all the necessary conditions are ripe for this. </p><br><p>  Of course, with the current economic system and the system of government, such a society is unlikely to be built.  We need to start designing the society of the future from scratch.  We need a state created on completely different principles. </p><br><p>  What will be required to build such a society: </p><br><ol><li>  We need direct democracy.  Direct, but not indirect power of the people.  I would like to abandon the "representative bodies of power", which sooner or later usurp power in their hands and democracy degenerates into the dictatorship of an individual or group of people.  All power must be in the literal sense, without any reservations - in the hands of the people.  Constantly, 24/7. </li><li>  We must always know exactly the needs of each person and understand what we need to meet these needs.  Ideally, we would like to achieve full satisfaction of all the needs of each person.  But this is hardly possible in the foreseeable future, so for now it makes sense to set a more modest goal - to meet the maximum needs of each person, taking into account the opportunities that society currently has. </li><li>  We must radically increase the efficiency of all processes in the country.  We must raise labor productivity by several times, reduce costs and inefficient actions, seriously increase the efficiency of the entire economy. </li></ol><br><p>  These requirements dictate to us a completely different organization of the state and society, a different economic and political system. </p><br><p>  To achieve the stated ambitious goals will require end-to-end digitization of the whole society.  It is necessary that the management of all processes in the country was initially digital.  So that all information flows are created in digital form.  Paper documents should not be digitized - they should not be created at all. </p><br><p>  We need a unified information environment, a unified centralized information system, built not chaotically, but according to a carefully designed plan.  Deeply thought out, well protected, knowing everything about everyone, caring for everyone, thinking about everyone, helping everyone.  It allows you to plan and organize all the processes in the country with maximum efficiency, helping to meet the needs and unlock the potential of each. </p><br><p>  We need to have in the center of the state not a separate official or state apparatus, but an electronic system that will implement the will of all the people. </p><br><h2 id="istoriya">  Story </h2><br><p>  Attempts to create such an information system have already been made.  The National Automated Information Accounting and Processing System (OGAS) is a project of an automated management system for the USSR economy based on the principles of cybernetics, including a computer network connecting data collection centers located in all regions of the country. </p><br><p>  It was developed in the USSR since the 1950s under the leadership of A.I.  Kitov and in the 1960-70s under the leadership of Academician Viktor Glushkov.  The ‚Äútechnical design of the OGAS system‚Äù appeared in the early 1980s, but was never approved by the leadership of the USSR.  Since the 1990s, the OGAS project has lost relevance due to the country's transition from socialist methods of economic management to market ones. </p><br><h2 id="prichiny-provala-ogas-v-sssr">  The reasons for the failure of OGAS in the USSR </h2><br><ul><li>  The need for a serious reorganization of the entire system of government in the USSR. </li><li>  The high cost of implementing the system. </li><li>  Weak development of digital, information technologies, communication networks. </li><li>  Resistance from the top leadership of the country. </li></ul><br><h2 id="predposylki">  Prerequisites </h2><br><p>  Nowadays, new opportunities are opening up for the implementation of this project.  The level of development of digital technologies and communication networks is far ahead of the opportunities available in Soviet times and make the implementation of the project of the system much cheaper, more efficient, and therefore more realistic.  The computing power of modern supercomputers allows us to solve any problems of accounting, production planning and distribution of goods and services in real time.  The presence of personal computers and smartphones in almost every home makes it possible to attract every citizen of the country to participate in the system. </p><br><h2 id="ideya">  Idea </h2><br><p>  To create a superpowerful centralized state digital system that will replace the state we are used to and will become a kind of ‚Äúbrain‚Äù for the whole country.  Connect to the system of all citizens, all enterprises and organizations, all government agencies.  And translate all communications between them into digital form. </p><br><ul><li>  All elections are held electronically. </li><li>  All laws are passed in a nationwide electronic referendum. </li><li>  Laws approved by national referendums are transformed into program code and become part of the algorithm of a unified state digital system. </li><li>  The system collects information about the needs of citizens of the country in digital form. </li><li>  Based on the collected data, a unified mathematical model of the entire economy is created, with the help of which production plans are made for all enterprises in the country. </li><li>  The mathematical model of the economy is optimized for the fullest achievement of the goals of society. </li><li>  The system also controls other aspects of society, such as finance, transport, education, health care, etc. </li></ul><br><h2 id="ogas-20">  OGAS 2.0 </h2><br><ul><li>  Powerful centralized nationwide information system with elements of artificial intelligence. </li><li>  Consists of a large number of information subsystems, closely interrelated with each other. </li><li>  All citizens of the country have secure access to the system via the Internet from their personal computers, smartphones and other digital devices. </li><li>  Integration into the system of all enterprises and all state authorities. </li></ul><br><h2 id="podsistemy-ogas-20">  OGAS 2.0 subsystems </h2><br><ul><li>  OGSVR - the national system of elections and referendums </li><li>  OGFS - a nationwide financial system </li><li>  OGSUP - nationwide production management system </li><li>  OGSZTU - a nationwide system of orders for goods and services </li><li>  OGSRZ - national system of work and employment </li><li>  OGSTL - national system of transport and logistics </li><li>  OGSRE - a nationwide system of resource management and energy </li><li>  and other subsystems </li></ul><br><h2 id="organizacionno-tehnicheskaya-struktura">  Organizational and technical structure </h2><br><ul><li>  The head of OGAS, with the rank of minister, reports directly to the head of state. </li><li>  OGAS Ministry (100-1000 employees). </li><li>  Service Center OGAS (1000-10000 technical staff). </li><li>  OGAS hardware and software resources, communication channels. </li><li>  Personal remote access terminals for citizens and businesses. </li><li>  Remote access trading terminals for commercial enterprises. </li></ul><br><h2 id="apparatnaya-arhitektura">  Hardware architecture </h2><br><ul><li>  The main data center (Moscow) is a powerful data center that hosts servers, data storages and backup power sources of the system. </li><li>  Backup data center (Ural) - an exact copy of the main data center with the maximum level of physical protection.  Can work when disconnecting the external power supply up to 30 days. </li><li>  Data centers constantly synchronize information with each other, maintaining a complete information identity. </li><li>  Fiber optic communication channels for connecting data centers to Internet traffic exchange points throughout the country. </li><li>  Key EDS (electronic digital signature) - each enterprise, organization, government agency and citizen of the country are given electronic signature keys, which allow them to reliably and unambiguously identify them when entering and performing any actions in the OGAS system. </li><li> Remote access personal terminals - access to the OGAS system is possible from any personal computer, smartphone, tablet and similar digital device via the Internet via a secure HTTPS protocol using the EDS key. </li><li>  Trading terminals (online cash desks) are electronic devices with a network connection, allow you to connect any trading enterprises to the OGAS system and collect and record information on all transactions for the sale of goods and services by all enterprises and organizations in the country in real time. </li></ul><br><h2 id="programmnaya-arhitektura">  Software architecture </h2><br><ul><li>  The software part of the system is developed on the basis of a specialized embedded framework. </li><li>  Data is stored in a single centralized database. </li><li>  All data is protected from unauthorized access. </li><li>  The program code ensuring the operation of the system interface, as well as the operation of the system security modules is closed from unauthorized access for everyone except authorized technical personnel of the OGAS system. </li><li>  The program code that implements the algorithms for processing personal, financial, economic, statistical data is open for all users of the system to view. </li><li>  Laws adopted in a nationwide electronic referendum are submitted for execution to a special Commission for the implementation of laws in the OGAS Technical Service Center. </li><li>  The Commission for the implementation of laws is preparing terms of reference for the implementation of this law. </li><li>  The technical task for the implementation of the law is executed by creating new software modules of the system, software algorithms, software "patches" that change the algorithms of the electronic system and affect the operation of one or more OGAS subsystems. </li><li>  The terms of reference for this draft law, as well as the list of ‚Äúpatches‚Äù with the source codes of ‚Äúpatches‚Äù, are laid out on the OGAS website in a form open for reading, for public control.  All citizens of the country can verify that the law is programmed exactly as it was formulated in the text of the bill. </li><li>  The system has an open API (Application Programming Interface), which allows integrating the OGAS system with other external systems. </li></ul><br><h2 id="setevaya-arhitektura">  Network architecture </h2><br><ul><li>  The data centers of the system must be connected by high-performance fiber-optic communication channels to the main points of Internet traffic exchange in the country so that the connection between any personal terminals of citizens and enterprises and servers of the data centers of the system goes with minimal delay. </li><li>  Due to the presence of multiple traffic exchange points and a large number of fiber-optic communication channels connecting data centers to the network, a reliable connection with any user of the system will be ensured.  In the event of a breakdown or inoperability of one of the communication channels, the connection will occur via alternative channels. </li><li>  It should be borne in mind that, since the Internet, on the basis of which it is planned to deploy OGAS 2.0, was originally developed as a military information exchange network, it will continue to function even in the event of war, which is a factor in the increased reliability of the system as a whole. </li></ul><br><h2 id="arhitektura-bezopasnosti">  Security architecture </h2><br><ul><li>  Due to the fact that the OGAS 2.0 system will be a centralized, highly loaded information system that processes a large amount of confidential personal information about every citizen and enterprise, and all key economic and political processes in the country will be tied to it, extraordinary security measures must be taken to ensure complete invulnerability of the system from any external and internal unauthorized impacts. </li><li>  Security measures should cover: physical security of people and equipment, information security, security of communication channels, ensuring confidentiality, protection against unauthorized access, protection against viruses, protection against hacker attacks, protection against information distortion, protection against DDOS attacks and other types of threats, not Also excluding the likelihood of a direct military strike on the main and backup data centers of the system with ballistic missiles of a potential enemy, including with a nuclear warhead. </li><li>  Security activities must be carried out continuously.  Various scenarios of damage to the system must be constantly modeled and tested, the search for weaknesses and vulnerabilities of the security system and their elimination is constantly under way. </li><li>  When creating the OGAS 2.0 system, mainly foreign software and hardware technologies will be used; therefore, special services should ensure reliable verification of all electronic devices and software products for the presence of spyware and dual-use functional blocks. </li><li>  Any potentially vulnerable protocols, software products, programming languages, network, server devices, data storage devices should be replaced with similar devices of domestic development or imported devices certified by special services. </li></ul><br><h2 id="veb-interfeys">  Web interface </h2><br><ul><li>  The web interface of the OGAS system is the protected user part of the OGAS system.  Available to all citizens and enterprises of the country through the Internet using a secure protocol HTTPS (or similar).  Allows all citizens, enterprises, organizations and government agencies to interact with the system. </li><li>  IPP (enterprise information portal) is a multifunctional interactive portal for each enterprise, organization, company, legal entity of the country.  It is part of the OGAS web interface.  It contains all the functionality offered for the enterprise by the OGAS system.  It allows the enterprise to interact with the OGAS system and receive from it all the information necessary for the operation of the enterprise. </li><li>  IPGO (information portal of the state body) is a multifunctional interactive portal of the state body.  It allows the state body to interact with citizens in electronic form and fulfill its duties as a state body using the portal's functionality. </li><li>  LKG (personal account of a citizen) is a multifunctional interactive portal of every citizen of the country in the OGAS system.  It allows a citizen in real time to use all the functionality of the system available to him, allows a citizen to directly participate in government administration. </li></ul><br><h2 id="rezyume">  Summary </h2><br><p>  The introduction of a centralized national electronic system will eliminate the chaotic and cruel mechanisms of self-regulation of the capitalist economy - competition, the desire to maximize profits, economic coercion, exploitation of man by man, and replace them with more efficient and humane management technologies based on accurate mathematical calculation and planning.  This will make it possible to realize a more perfect and fair political and economic structure of society. </p><br><p>  For the implementation of the system, it will require serious transformations of the entire economic system, the entire socio-political structure of the country. </p><br><p>  OGAS 2.0 system, after its full-scale implementation, will become a full-fledged digital control system for all spheres of life of the state and society.  It will allow realizing the true power of the people, optimizing all processes in the country, increasing production efficiency, achieving a truly equitable distribution of material goods, reducing costs, and making the life of citizens of the country simpler, more convenient and easier. </p><br><p>  Other results of using the system: </p><br><ul><li>  The growth of the welfare of all citizens of the country. </li><li>  Reducing the number of people employed in non-productive sectors of the economy. </li><li>  Reducing the state apparatus and the cost of it. </li><li>  Increase in the growth rate of the country's GDP. </li><li>  Shorter working day. </li><li>  Reducing social inequalities and social tensions in the country. </li><li>  Guaranteed employment will give everyone confidence in the future. </li><li>  Transparent economy and financial system </li><li>  Promotion of inventive activity </li><li>  Reducing opportunities for corruption and theft </li><li>  Reduced bureaucracy and paperwork </li></ul><br><p>  Social ownership of the main means of production, planning and full digitalization of the whole society - these are the key measures that may well enable us to create a truly solid and successful dream society - a society of universal prosperity, justice and equal opportunities for everyone. </p></div>
