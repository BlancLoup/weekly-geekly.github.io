The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa startup was the reform of Obamacare healthcare.  Currently, Oscar Health serves more than 145,000 customers, but for the purpose of the head of the company, Mario Schlosser, to recruit more than a million.

      Warren worked at Google since 2004 and was responsible for developing Google Docs and Google Drive.  Prior to that, he headed the New York office of Google.  During his work, he grew from 50 to 3,000 employees and the desire to develop something new to such a scale was the main reason for the transition to Oscar Health. <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúI felt the need to once again take part in the development of something small and new.  One of the objectives of Oscar Health is to improve the user experience, I was surprised that a third of the project's clients come through the recommendations of friends, ‚Äùshared Alan Warren, the reason for the transition to Oscar Health. </blockquote><br>  Warren also worked for Google Health, a search giant that was supposed to centralize personal information about users' health.  The main problem in the implementation of this project was the difficulty in obtaining personal data about the state of health of the user. <br><br>  From this point of view, Oscar Health has definitely more potential - the startup has already received support from a number of organizations and $ 720 million of investments from investors such as Google Capital and Peter Thiel.  The market capitalization of a startup <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-02-23/oscar-said-to-be-valued-at-2-7-billion-in-fidelity-led-round">is estimated by</a> analysts at $ 2.7 billion. Registered as a health care company, Oscar Health does not encounter similar restrictions and can obtain any data on the health of customers necessary for their insurance.  On the technical side, the project is not inferior to other large companies on the market due to greater flexibility and willingness to integrate new solutions. <br><br>  Oscar Health is based on the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcontacting an insurance company through an application - you can register an insured event and sign up with a doctor directly in a mobile application in a convenient form.  In part, the startup approach resembles that in domestic and foreign mobile banks, whose experience is now gradually penetrating into other areas of business. <br><br>  It should be noted that the last CTO Oscar Health Frederick Nilander, who came from the company Tumblr, left the startup in the fall.  At that time, the company recorded losses <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-03-02/startup-oscar-posts-92-4-million-obamacare-loss-in-new-york">of $ 105.2 million</a> and the question of its profitability remained in question in the absence of stable growth. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299360/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299360/</a></p>
