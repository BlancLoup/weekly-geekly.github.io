It should be noted that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_(anonymity_network)">Tor</a> has a similar problem - only in relation to the <a href="https://hackertarget.com/tor-exit-node-visualization/">output nodes</a> . <br><br>  This problem is leveled by the use of transport-level security - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">TLS</a> , <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSL">SSL</a> , <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS">HTTPS</a> , <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BF%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2584%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB">et cetera</a> - this is quite enough to feel confident when using network resources.  And, of course, do not forget about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy">PGP</a> and the principles of asymmetric cryptography when exchanging messages. <br><br>  Thanks to the use of I2P, it becomes impossible to calculate not only the router where the traffic came from (see the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garlic_routing">basic principles of ‚Äúgarlic‚Äù traffic routing</a> ), but also the end user - the ‚ÄúMedium‚Äù subscriber. <br><br>  As a pleasant bonus - the impossibility of blocking the network and access to the computing resources of its participants - for this it is necessary to limit the work of the entire Internet at the physical level.  Turn off and no longer turn on. <br><br>  From a legal point of view (in accordance with <a href="http://www.consultant.ru/document/cons_doc_LAW_162586/">Federal Law No. 97-FZ of May 5, 2014</a> ), located in the territory of the Russian Federation, ‚ÄúMedium‚Äù may be partially covered by restrictions imposed by law, but here it makes sense to take into account the following nuances: <br><br><ol><li>  Medium is not a legal entity;  each member is a standalone ISP with the same name; </li><li>  The access points to the ‚ÄúMedium‚Äù would be open (they do not have a password for connecting by default), but they are hidden: a person who does not know the name of the network will not be able to connect to it; </li><li>  ‚ÄúMedium‚Äù provides access to the I2P network, and not the Internet (even if it is possible to connect to the network via outproxy - at the discretion of the existing operator ‚ÄúMedium‚Äù; for the same reason, ‚ÄúMedium‚Äù can be safely called ISP). </li></ol><br><h2>  Why is this? </h2><br>  We believe that the Internet should be politically neutral and free ‚Äî the principles on the basis of which the worldwide network was built do not withstand any criticism.  <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/07/the-man-who-created-the-world-wide-web-has-some-regrets">They are outdated</a> .  <a href="https://lifehacker.com/its-no-surprise-anymore-your-data-is-never-safe-onlin-1471858210">They are unsafe</a> .  We live in Legacy.  Any centralized network is compromised by default - and this is one of the reasons why we deploy ‚ÄúMedium‚Äù. <br><br>  We believe that confidentiality is one of those foundations without which a calm and measured life of a person is impossible. <br><br>  We believe that everyone has the right to the confidentiality and integrity of their data. <br><br>  We believe that Medium will be able to render feasible assistance to the development of the I2P network - after all, with each new raised Medium point, a new transit node appears in the I2P network. <br><br><h2>  Like this? </h2><br>  The essence of the decentralized Medium ISP is to provide the end user with the opportunity to use the resources of the I2P network without directly paying for Internet traffic. <br><br>  The concept of the Medium ISP is quite prosaic ‚Äî many people interested in this raise their wireless access points to the I2P network without the ability to view Internet traffic by default (the ability to use outproxy is not forbidden, but not welcome: ‚ÄúMedium‚Äù should promote the growth of transit points and sites on the I2P network).  Infrastructure deployment takes place at no cost - pure enthusiasm. <br><br>  At the very beginning of the development of the project, special attention was focused on ensuring that users could freely use the resources of the I2P network - even if not quite as planned when creating the concept of the ‚Äúinvisible Internet‚Äù, but still bypassing the paradigms of the usual Internet - which is already good . <br><br>  And yet so that the subscriber's connection to the network does not constitute special difficulties: the ability to connect via Wi-Fi now does not seem to be something supernatural for the average user. <br><br>  What we have: volunteers (system operators) who control the access points of the Medium network and the subscribers themselves, who use the resources of the network.  Due to the fact that I2P uses only a small part of the bandwidth of the common channel, it should not be difficult for system operators to keep up to 5-10 subscribers connected to themselves. <br><br><h2>  Where is it? </h2><br>  At this stage of development, Medium has several access points in <a href="https://github.com/podivilov/medium/tree/master/ru/50/kolomna">Kolomna</a> , <a href="https://github.com/podivilov/medium/tree/master/ru/72/tyumen">Tyumen</a> and one in <a href="https://github.com/podivilov/medium/tree/master/ru/63/samara">Samara</a> . <br><br>  We hope for the active assistance of the community to the development of the project ‚ÄúMedium‚Äù - instructions for raising your authentic point can be found <a href="">here</a> .  You can also send a PR to add your point to the public list of all points on the network. <br><br><h2>  I want to become a volunteer!  What do I need to do for that? </h2><br>  Raise your <a href="">hotspot</a> and join the <a href="https://github.com/podivilov/medium/issues/1">project discussion on GitHub</a> .  In this thread, all the most significant nuances of the long-term development of the Medium network are discussed. <br><br>  If you are already an operator of a valid ‚ÄúMedium‚Äù point, do not forget to create a <a href="https://github.com/podivilov/medium/pulls">PR on GitHub</a> to add your point to the public list of all points on the network.  <a href="">Here</a> you can find useful information on how to design a PR. <br><br>  <a href="https://github.com/podivilov/medium/tree/master/ru">List of all network points</a> ‚Ä¢ <a href="">Instructions on how to configure your AP</a> ‚Ä¢ <a href="">Add your point to the list</a> <br><br>  Telegram Channel: <a href="https://t.me/medium_isp">@medium_isp</a> <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Our friends</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Thanks to <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/theklacy/" class="user_link">theklacy</a> for deploying access points in Samara and Tyumen. <br></div></div><br><hr><br>  <i><font color="gray">Be extremely careful: the article is written solely for educational purposes.</font></i>  <i><font color="gray">Do not forget that ignorance is power, freedom is slavery, and war is peace.</font></i> <i><font color="gray"><br><br></font></i>  <i><font color="gray">For you already left.</font></i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/449244/">https://habr.com/ru/post/449244/</a></p>
