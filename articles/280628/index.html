As it was <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/cpp_russia/blog/268757/">stated</a> , on February 26-27, a community conference was held under the glorious name of C ++ Russia 2016. The event took place on the banks of the Neva in the walls, halls and halls of the Park Inn by Baltic Hotel. <br><br>  What is there and how?  Next - under the cat! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  The conference </h2><br>  The flagship of Russia C ++ is of course the speakers and reports (notepads and a party by itself, but still ...).  This time, the software part has grown quantitatively compared with Moscow in 2015 - it turned out 2 days, 3 tracks, 25 reports.  The program came out extremely diverse in topics:

    <ul><li>  started with an exciting story from Gor Nishanov (Coroutines) </li><li>  English lessons recalled at guest presentations by Joel Falcou (Boost.SIMD), Kirk Shoop (Reactive programming), Dori Exterman (Parallel computing strategy) </li><li>  learned different things from grated speakers Alexander Fokin (Reflection) and Dmitry Nesteruk (Patterns) </li><li>  listened to insider information from Anton Polukhin (Boost) </li><li>  played baseball with pitcher Mikhail Matrosov (Casual C ++) </li><li>  as well as many, many, many more </li></ul><br>  Presentation slides are uploaded, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist%3Flist%3DPLrs_DcVZNww21UVq-vrGSFwjJc_zvfb5u">videos</a> released on the air just the other day - watch, learn, rejoice! <br><br>  It was possible to have a bite to eat with a good portion of communication with fellows by vocation, of which about 400 people gathered, as well as with speakers and company representatives at the stands, since the space of the hotel and coffee allowed. <br><br>  From business were Kaspersky Lab, JetBrains, Artec 3D, SystemPro, Luxsoft and Yandex.  The teams on the stands were pleased with communication, chips and buns, and also tried to load the brain cracking from the information with Olympiad programming! <br><br><h2>  Aperitif </h2><br>  On the eve of the conference, home events in St. Petersburg offices were organized by JetBrains and Yandex. <br><br>  The company JetBrains gathered people to the party <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/JetBrains/blog/279925/">JetBrains C ++ night</a> .  Here it was possible to talk on the company's product line directly with the developers, mini-insider, after all.  JetBrains also presented variations on Resharper, CLion and HPC in the form of reports. <br><br>  Yandex, in turn, held a talk show of <a href="https://events.yandex.ru/lib/talks/3339/">What is happening in C ++</a> , inviting foreign guests to the C ++ Russia conference for a conversation.  They talked for a long time and interesting.  Many and optimistic ( <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/infopulse/blog/279927/">oh</a> ) about C ++ 17, about modules and cortices, about modules and concepts, about modules and bad macros and about many other things of course. <br><br>  Aperitif was a success very high quality.  Thanks to the companies for the healthy events, it was interesting to drive teas in the Yandex office) <br><br><h2>  So, he's the result </h2><br>  This C ++ marathon was issued by Peter in the last days of winter.  It seems that C ++ in our country is loved, appreciated and known (slightly).  And to show yourself, to see others, to get acquainted, to talk, to learn something, to look at the masters of their work, at the people, what libraries and language do, create competences and skills, share findings and techniques - all this was done by a perfectly organized C + conf + Russia.  For all this, we have a community of caring programmers and companies.  Hooray! <br><br>  On the other hand, to bring excellent speakers from around the world - it turns out - quite real.  Gor Nishanov, in my opinion, became an asterisk of the conference - both on the report, and on open communication, and on the Russian language.  And Joel Falcou, judging by the functions and source codes of Boost.SIMD, in collusion with the dark forces of metaprogramming.  Well, not every day you see how Dori Exterman tells in the corridor how IncrediBuild is so damn difficult implemented and why the company is not afraid of the appearance of modules in C ++. <br><br>  Thanks to the organizers and participants - it was great!  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/sermp/" class="user_link">sermp</a> , thanks for the work, thanks for the community! <br><br><h2>  What's next? </h2><br>  Ahead in plans - to take Kazan with a community meeting, to take Siberia - with a conference. <br><br>  In the comments we share our impressions, ask questions, answer answers and all that. <br><br>  <i>PS For all errors, omissions, rebirths, offenses and insults in the post, anyone is responsible, but not the author (these are some techniques you can dig into books on algorithms)!</i> <br><br>  <i>PPS C ++ in the Urals!</i>  <i>If you are, respond, organize and activate!</i>  <i>While the region falls out of the geography of the active C ++ community.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/280628/">https://habr.com/ru/post/280628/</a></p>
