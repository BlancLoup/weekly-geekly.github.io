  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Perfect posture with LUMOback</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Like most of Habr's visitors, I spend a lot of time at the computer.  On average, it turns out 10-12 hours a day.  During this time, as soon as you do not get kicked in a chair to sit comfortably and continue your passion.  The most courageous people do exercises during breaks or short walks on the street.  All this time, which is devoted to work, games or just surfing the Internet, I, by and large, sat like a chess horse.  You don‚Äôt think about this nonsense and you simply don‚Äôt notice when you are in the world of virtual reality and are passionate about something.  As a busy person, all these questions didn‚Äôt bother me until people began to notice that sometimes I slouch and keep my back straight.  But this fact has not moved me to anything good.  And just recently I met LUMOback. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/af9/c42/48b/af9c4248b7b86534cdb0b3c4db55559d.jpg"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      The set is very minimalistic and there is nothing besides the device itself, the USB cable and the instructions included. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/683/b04/a5f/683b04a5fed0df39866f5682e9725b28.jpg"><br><br>  The instruction shows us what the different colors of the light bulb on the belt mean when it is active, but I will not dwell on this, because you cannot see all this when the sensor is working and is on the back. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/673/105/bc1/673105bc1fa56313ed57b28965e33a2c.jpg"><br><br>  LUMOback is a belt that is installed on the waist and secured to it with Velcro.  The belt has a built-in Bluetooth smart sensor, which forces you to keep your posture straight when sitting and walking.  A micromotor is built into this sensor, which vibrates if you sit incorrectly, slouch, or walk not straight. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9fb/3da/276/9fb3da27667959bea9811018f38fbf5c.jpg"><br><br>  After activating Bluetooth on the phone and running the program on the IPhone, the firmware was automatically updated and LUMO suggested that I get acquainted with the instructions for ‚Äúinstalling‚Äù the belt on the waist.  Quickly wrapping the belt around the waist, throwing velcro of a friend over a friend on the screen came the suggestion to create an account, but what about without it?  Filling out all my data, I was gently summed up to calibrate the device.  I was a little bit like, sat down, stood up and proceeded to my normal life - working at a computer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/850/3b8/a64/8503b8a645f2704cb533a98c947e2b19.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/65c/32d/cd2/65c32dcd2e8fdfe1447d01079940a66c.jpg"><br><br>  As you already understood, this device is controlled by one small application that exists only on iOS.  The application is called LUMOback, which can easily be found in the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lumoback-real-time-posture/id575786694%3Fmt%3D8">iTunes Store</a> .  The application is able to collect unique information in real time and instantly displays it on the display of your iOS device. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8bc/b8f/844/8bcb8f8446f552d1b1a8e83cf4f8aeeb.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/91f/351/e3b/91f351e3b689dcd999c91e9372ace0b2.jpg"><br><br>  Steps, calories, kilometers and other useful information will come to the phone in any case, even if your phone is busy with other things. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/015/ec5/732/015ec57329d86624f4f64431a4cf8be3.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fe8/f0a/c3e/fe8f0ac3ecf98eb4746103f1a21aab67.jpg"><br><br>  You can walk, stand or sit and LUMOback will tell you whether everything is correct with your posture and will give a vibrating signal that instantly scatters through your spine.  The vibrating signal is not very pleasant, so it‚Äôs better to adopt the correct posture than to get another ‚Äúshot in the back‚Äù.  In the settings, the vibration can be completely turned off or set to a persistent mode, in which the belt will vibrate constantly, until you adopt the correct posture. <br><br>  Sensitivity to change your posture can be adjusted, so in the first days of use, I recommend making a little relief and lowering the virtual slider by about the middle. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8cc/52b/f08/8cc52bf089b55fd9f4c28702a366d244.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e23/7dc/bc2/e237dcbc295e360440924a7c147798ec.jpg"><br><br>  For a week of constant use, LUMOback found some discipline in me that allowed me to keep my back straight most of the time at the computer.  Although, I confess honestly, sometimes I really want to take it off and put it in the far corner, but the positive changes in my posture that prevent me from doing so. <br><br>  Summing up, it is safe to call the LUMOback device one of the most successful projects with Kickstarter, which can safely have the second name ‚Äúmust have‚Äù for any user of a personal computer.  Of course, the price is a bit scary, because in Russia this belt costs around 7,000 rubles, but on the <a href="http://www.lumoback.com/">official website</a> you can snatch it for $ 149 (~ 4,800 rubles).  Of course, such purchases can be avoided if you have good willpower or hang on a horizontal bar every day and play active sports.  To take or not to take - the choice is yours! <br><br>  PS <b>$ 50</b> discount coupon: <b>TURKEY</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/204070/">https://habr.com/ru/post/204070/</a></p>
