      Some time ago, I was frightened by the fact that I need to issue foreign economic activity, get permission, with this a lot of problems, additional taxes, etc.  Rave.  All you need is to be registered as a state of emergency, drawn up in tax on simplified (single tax, as a rule) or any other form of taxation and have a seal.  On the receipt of the print can be further.  Next, open a multi-currency account in the bank and submit information about it to the tax. <br><br>  Now you can start getting paid.  The only thing, according to the legislative basis, you must submit to the bank for crediting the money sent by the customer with your contract and the act of acceptance and transfer of work performed (or invoice).  Copies enough.  Hint: you can personally go nowhere, stamped, signed, scanned - sent to the customer by e-mail, he signed on his side, stamped (if he has one at all), sent.  We print and get a full copy. <br><br>  And there is a nuance here - the money must be credited to the account within 180 days (this is according to current legislation, yesterday there was information that the president has already signed amendments that will come into effect within 10 days after publication, containing, inter alia, the change of time of the notorious enrollment from 180 to 90 days) from the date of signing of the act (invoice).  The payment details must include the invoice number and the contract number. <br><br>  Got money, life is beautiful.  Everything?  No, now we must tell the state that you received them. <br><br>  <b>First</b> , this amount goes to the book of accounting of incomes and expenses and is added to your other incomes in a regular quarterly report. <br>  <b>Secondly</b> , you need to submit to the currency department a tax report on currency transactions.  It is rented quarterly by the growing amount (i.e., the amount in the report for the second quarter = the amount in the report for the first + actual foreign exchange earnings in the second) only in those quarters where the foreign exchange earnings were.  Plus, an annual report is also submitted, which indicates the total amount for the year. <br><br>  It was recognized and verified by the example of a private individual, but I am almost sure that the procedure for LLC and others is similar.  If suddenly wrong, correct. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/76188/">https://habr.com/ru/post/76188/</a></p>
