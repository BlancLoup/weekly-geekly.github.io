  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Hitachi SimpleDrive III: How do two terabytes and USB 2.0 fit together?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The company Hitachi (more precisely, its division Hitachi GST, formed after the purchase of the IBM hard drive business) for a very long time did not want to produce external drives under its own brand.  When WD and Seagate were already trading with them, Hitachi was terribly afraid of offending partners.  Like, how is it that they buy our discs for their outsiders, and we will compete with them?  Suddenly will not buy? <br><br>  However, in 2009, it was not time for sentiment, and Hitachi bought one long-time partner, SimpleTech, and still went to the market, which by that moment was divided ‚Äúslightly more than completely.‚Äù  On the other hand, better late than never.  Last year, sales started in North America, and at the beginning of 2010, they somehow began to stir in Russia.  So much so that one old friend, knowing my love for hard drives of exotic species, found and presented me with a Hitachi SimpleDrive III of 2 terabytes for my birthday. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/724/0dc/844/7240dc844f18c596622c0634a5542f94.jpg" alt="Hitachi SimpleDrive III">

      Having rejoiced at the volume, I looked at the technical characteristics of the gift and internally frowned.  No, well, what's up: two terabytes are proposed to be pumped through the USB 2.0 interface!  But where is this good for?  By that time I had been sitting on the WD My Book with FireWire 400/800 support for a couple of years and was eager to switch to eSATA.  Moreover, the terabyte volume of the old disk was not enough and I was going to go shopping soon.  And here is such a trick!  Well, you will not go to buy a new hard drive instead of the existing one just because the speed is too small? <br><br>  In general, the disc lay in the box for quite a long time, and I planned to pick it up, remove the hard drive and use it in a special sled, which I even bought.  The usual plastic stuff with a propeller (350 rubles for everything), where you insert the HDD, push it more tightly, reboot the computer, and here you have two terabytes for backup and anything.  But I was embarrassed by the binding of the disk to a single computer, while I regularly need to back up at least three.  Well, this is a reboot so that the system sees the disk ... Irritating, I can‚Äôt do anything with myself. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/74e/563/4d4/74e5634d4a2e8d0fe2392cbcad8a865c.jpg" alt="Hitachi SimpleDrive III"><br><br>  As a result, once connected Hitachi SimpleDrive, two connected and ... was involved.  Well, yes, it turns out slowly, 32 megabytes per second for reading and 30 for writing.  But it turned out that even such a haste, like me, the backup time does not soar at all.  He slaps there, and let him slap as much as he needs.  But without any problems, it is connected to all computers with one cable, whereas with the old WD it was necessary for the laptops to stick a USB-cord instead of FireWire.  And all because on one laptop FireWire was with another connector, smaller (too lazy to spend money on it), and on the other two it was not at all.  Now is happiness.  The screw is turned on only when you plug USB into the computer, and it turns off as soon as you pull it out.  The cable is long, I reach everywhere.  Once a week, I played a butterfly with a long proboscis, and then until next weekend you live almost calmly. <br><br>  One thing that annoys me at SimpleDrive is buzzing, contagious.  In theory, there are no propellers there, and the only sound source is the hard drive itself.  If there were some Hitachi CinemaStar with a spindle speed of 5400 rev / min (analogue of WD GreenPower and almost analogue of Seagate Barracuda LP), everything would be almost perfectly quiet.  But no!  These ghouls stuck their freshest <a href="http://www.hitachigst.com/deskstar-7k2000">DeskStar 7K2000 HDS722020ALA330</a> into the case with a USB interface (!)!  And this, by the way, is 7200 rpm, 32 MB buffer and FIVE PLATES!  It is clear that it vibrates slightly, sir.  The problem is cured if you put the disk on something soft, but then the access of air into the case is blocked: all the main holes are located below.  For beauty, I guess.  And although the aluminum case, forcing such a mighty screw to work in the dullness is dangerous.  Well, in general, it's a shame that the potential of the top Hitachi internal drive with SATA interface remains unrealized ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f81/4ba/f20/f814baf20a84fb668aed4110178c1433.jpg" alt="Hitachi SimpleDrive III"><br><br>  I do not exclude the option that once I will buy an external box with eSATA and USB support at the same time, ruthlessly pick the case of the SimpleDrive with a screwdriver and move the hard drive to a new fast house.  Such boxes already appear at 1000-1200 rubles and there is hope that the price will slide down a little more.  Plus, I do not want to put on the table a clumsy Chinese horror - the current one is quite decent. <br><br>  In the meantime, I continue to back up slowly, but quite conveniently.  If you are limited in budget, or in your city with a choice of full seams (as in my native Saratov), ‚Äã‚Äãyou can take a bit more, and the interface is simpler.  Let the boxes come and go - the main thing is that the data remain :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/95629/">https://habr.com/ru/post/95629/</a></p>
