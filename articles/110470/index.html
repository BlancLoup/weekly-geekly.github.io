RF.  It is strange that no one was hooked on the last two important events: the hearing in the FAS and the first meeting of the special commission of the Coordination Center.  Information on the data, in general, the key events of the past week in open sources, frankly, a little.  I tried to collect what is, and I will be grateful to habrovchanam for additional information. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Let's start in order.  A special commission of the Coordination Center met for the first time on Friday.  I found out about it from the <a href="http://twitter.com/Khinshtein/">twitter of one of the commission members - Alexander Hinstein.</a>  Here are his tweets from December 15: <br><br>  <i>1:45 PM Dec 15th Today the commission to investigate the scandal with the domain zone of the Russian Federation.</i>  <i>I want to finish the job.</i>  <i>The fight to be serious!</i> <i>

    </i>  <i>Wed Dec 15 2010 21:04:07 Until now, we are sitting in the KC of the national internet domain, torn with the zone of the Russian Federation.</i>  <i>Interesting.</i>  <i>But for a long time.</i>  <i>And judge for yourself and really at 23.50)))</i> <br><br>  To the user's question whether there will be a broadcast of this event and where it will be possible to read the transcript of the commission, Mr. Khinstein answered: <br>  <i>@ dmi69 broadcast will be on the basis of work Wed Dec 15 2010 14:29:04</i> <br><br>  Let me remind you that the <a href="http//cctld.ru/ru/press_center/news/news_detail.php%3FID%3D1137">Coordination Center announced the</a> creation of the commission <a href="http//cctld.ru/ru/press_center/news/news_detail.php%3FID%3D1137">on November 29, 2010:</a> <br>  <i>In the coming days, another commission will be created, which will include representatives of the Internet public, State Duma deputies, representatives of the FAS and the Ministry of Communications and Mass Communications.</i>  <i>The task of this commission is to study the progress of open registration of domain names in domain. RF and give its assessment of the results of the launch of the domain zone, including formulating recommendations for the Coordination Center Council regarding possible violations of registration regulations.</i> <br><br>  Since this publication, neither the composition of the commission, nor the regulations and the timing of its work, the CC has not said a word.  If it were not for Hinstein, perhaps the public would never have known anything.  After the commission, Khinshtein did not write anything else, apparently, he was silenced in the KC. <br><br>  At the same time, I will remind you that Vorobiev and Foresters at the press conference ‚ÄúStart of free registration of the domain of the Russian Federation: problems and prospects for their solution‚Äù <a href="">[full video]</a> assured that the work of the commission will be as open as possible. <br><br>  What happened in the FAS the next day, December 16, during the hearing on the <a href="http://www.fas.gov.ru/fas-news/fas-news_31178.html">case against CJSC Regional Network Information Center, ANO Regional Network Information Center, RELCOM.DELOVAYA NETWORK, Demos-Internet CJSC ", CJSC Registrar, CJSC Elvis-Telecom</a> , from official sources it is even less known: there is one <a href="http://cctld.ru/ru/press_center/news/news_detail.php%3FID%3D1179">news</a> in the presence <a href="http://cctld.ru/ru/press_center/news/news_detail.php%3FID%3D1179">, which appeared immediately after the end of the hearing on the CC website</a> .  From her we learn that <br>  <i>as a result of the hearings, the decision of the FAS refers to the postponement of consideration of the case to the third decade of January.</i>  <i>The FAS also requested additional documents due to the fact that the antimonopoly authority found in the actions of the defendants signs of a violation of Article 14 of the Law FZ-135 on protection of competition, namely the ban on unfair competition</i> . <br><br>  In the news, KC focuses on its own position: <br>  <i>The representative of the Coordination Center asked the FAS to consider all the facts and arguments cited, and also to withdraw the illegally obtained funds to the state</i> . <br><br>  RU-Center's comments on this issue are not in the media, nor in blogs, or on the official website. <br><br>  But in the media and blogs leaked comments from one of the applicants - Ekaterina Govorkova.  In her LiveJournal, she <a href="http://katrinn.livejournal.com/61960.html">talks about the meeting</a> in the FAS: <br><br>  <i>Now, no technical agreement between the registrar companies allegedly exists, and there were either ‚Äúpartnership agreements‚Äù or ‚Äúclient agreements‚Äù - the registrars do not have a common opinion on this and haven‚Äôt decided with what they concluded with Rutsentr.</i>  <i>We have already reached the point that there is no cooperation between the autonomous non-profit organization and the RSIC.</i>  <i>And to my question, which registrar gets the application from the nic.ru website - to the closed joint-stock company or the autonomous non-profit organization, they started to get confused about the testimony, to talk about supposedly two separate forms on this site</i> . <br><br>  <i>I asked a question about the change of administrators of 330 domain names.</i>  <i>For example, I gave the domain I-President.</i>  <i>After clarification, the director of the Coordination Center A. Kolesnikov confirmed that, in violation of the rules, Ru-Center re-registered this domain from an individual to himself.</i>  <i>And the technical center of the Internet domain network and the Coordination Center in one voice recognize violations in the actions of registrars</i> . <br><br>  And also - <a href="http://katrinn.livejournal.com/62293.html">on the decision of the FAS to initiate a case under article 14 of the Federal Law "On Protection of Competition":</a> <br>  <i>During the meeting, the lawyer Grinkevich asked me a question, what, actually, I see as a violation of my rights by the registrars?</i>  <i>The domain was transferred to me, I use it, in a year I will be made its administrator.</i> <br><br>  <i>I replied that by concluding an agreement to purchase a domain name, as a result, for the same money I acquired ‚Äúair‚Äù, that is, the mythical rights of the ‚Äúdomain owner‚Äù (the status invented by the Ru-Center and not reflected in any Whois other than Ru-Center.) The domain remained with Ru-Center.</i>  <i>At the same time, I am deprived of the right to defend my interests related to the domain, to defend the right to it in court.</i>  <i>The defendant in cases filed in respect of my domain will be the Ru-Center.</i>  <i>I do not have the right to file a lawsuit as a person who does not have domain name rights</i> . <br><br>  <i>That is, in fact, I was misled about the nature of the goods I purchased, and this is exactly p. 2, p. 1, art.</i>  <i>14 of the law</i> . <br><br>  Also in PCWeek's blog, you can look at two documents: <a href="http://www.pcweek.ru/gover/blog/denis-voeykov/465.php">an order to initiate a case and a definition about the appointment of a case to the FAS</a> . <br><br>  Here, strictly speaking, all the information that, in principle, managed to find.  It must be said, suspiciously little.  No less suspicious that there is so little media noise.  It seems that the topic was just hushed up. <br>  In the meantime, while FAS and KC are not in a hurry to solve existing problems, domains are bought at auctions for tens of thousands of dollars and are already in use.  For example, Dr.  The Web is already working on the domain <a href="http://xn--80aerbwvhdn.xn--p1ai/">antivirus</a> . Rf, bought at the auction of units for 30 cu <br><br>  It can be assumed that the revision of auctions will be a task practically impracticable, as well as a revision of the results of privatization. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/110470/">https://habr.com/ru/post/110470/</a></p>
