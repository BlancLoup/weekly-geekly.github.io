  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Expensive smartphones in Russia account for 25% of the revenue from sales of smart phones</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Despite the weakening of the ruble against the dollar and the subsequent significant increase in the ruble value of top-end smartphone models, such devices remain in demand among buyers.  So, in the period from January to June 2015, smartphones with a price of 30 thousand rubles.  occupied about 25% of the Russian smartphone market, Vedomosti reports.  Last year, over the same period, the market volume of flagship smartphones accounted for about 5% of the total smart phone market.  In units, sales rose to 6%, rising from 1% a year earlier.  At the same time, sales of expensive smartphones with a price higher than 30 thousand rubles grew faster than sales of smartphones of all other price categories: by 400% in monetary terms, and by 304% in quantitative terms.  Such data leads Euroset in its report. <br><br>  Ulyana Smolskaya, a representative of Euroset, explains such a rapid growth of expensive smartphones by the fact that now phones that fell into the category of devices ‚Äúprice above 30 thousand rubles‚Äù cost 18,000 - 25,000 rubles before the fall of the ruble.  There is also an indirect confirmation of this point of view: for example, in the first half of 2015, sales of smart phones in this segment dropped significantly (by 54% in quantitative terms and by 55% in monetary terms).  The overall growth rate of the cost of a smartphone in Russia year-on-year was about 13%, or 9,600 rubles. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/804/e23/2cd/804e232cd6bba90476e14dd7c31ef9cb.png"><br><br>  Other companies have a similar situation with sales of expensive smartphones.  So, according to MTS, smartphones with a price above 30 thousand rubles.  in the first half of this year, they occupied about 26% of the market in terms of sales revenue.  Due to the growth in demand for such devices, the smartphone market came out n plus in the first half of 2015. Total revenue from smartphone sales year to year, according to MTS representative Dmitry Solodovnikov, grew by about 7%.  At the same time, in April 2015, MTS reduced the prices of all devices with mobile Internet by about a third, which allowed increasing sales of expensive smartphones by several times.

      According to Maria Zaikina, a representative of Svyaznoy, the growth in sales of expensive smartphones is not evidence of consumer preferences, but rather shows a change in the overall structure of the smartphone market.  So, in January-June 2014 the most expensive price segment of the market, with smartphones at a price higher than 25 thousand rubles, occupied about 20% of the market in rubles, and 6% in units.  Now those devices that cost more than 25,000 rubles on the market are already worth more than 30,000 rubles. <br><br>  The CEO of Telecom Daily, Denis Kuskov, believes that the crisis has divided the smart phone market into two parts: buyers acquire either very cheap or very expensive smartphone models.  In the first quarter of 2015, on devices worth 6,000-8,000 rubles.  accounted for about 40% of the market, in quantitative terms.  Those buyers who could afford to purchase a premium-class device before the crisis, most of them can buy such devices now.  At the same time, people are willing to pay more for the functions they need. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/292466/">https://habr.com/ru/post/292466/</a></p>
