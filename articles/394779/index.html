Microsoft has used a number of techniques to increase the share of Windows 10 on the market, some of which sometimes seem to be not completely "white".  The network even appeared a <a href="https://www.change.org/p/the-electonic-frontier-foundation-have-the-eff-investigate-microsoft-for-malicious-practices-regarding-windows-10">petition</a> , the authors of which call for an investigation of the work of Microsoft with its aggressive update policy.  The problem is not in the OS itself, everything is fine with it, but with the update policy pursued by the company.  But sometimes it can be useful.

      A <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/4mwgng/users_computer_was_hijacked_via_teamviewer_and/">Reddit</a> user who suffered because of a recent hack, TeamViewer noticed that the attacker was disconnected from the system and simply did not have anything bad to do.  Just during the OS hacking, the user's computer decided to upgrade to Windows 10. According to Microsoft itself, this OS protects the user from outside interference as much as possible. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In most cases, TeamViewer burglars seek to find the victim's account information for PayPal or other similar information.  This time, the cracker failed, which turned out to be a happy coincidence for the victim herself.  In any case, the Reddit user claims so, this is the only source of information about what happened.  As soon as the Windows 10 installer started, the hacker was disconnected from the system, since the network connection was also deactivated, in automatic mode. <br><br>  But what happened after the OS was updated, and the PC rebooted?  You can expect the hacker to reconnect, right?  No, in this case the situation was different. <br><br>  TeamViewer was deleted during the system update, so that after the upgrade procedure was completed, the attacker was no longer able to access the victim's PC.  And this seems to be true, since Windows 10 removes applications that are marked as incompatible with this version of the operating system. <br><br>  Of course, to check all this is not possible, but if all this is true, then the case is really interesting.  Or maybe it was the hacker himself who decided to upgrade the user's PC to Windows 10?  Although unlikely, this is too unbelievable. <br><br>  As for TeamViewer, reports of hacking service accounts appear with enviable regularity.  The first messages appeared about a month ago, and now the number of victims <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/276836/">already reaches many hundreds</a> .  As far as can be judged, the reason for hacking a large number of accounts is a massive leak of authorization data of users using the same passwords for different sites.  Among the victims are even information security specialists, <a href="https://securityintelligence.com/compromised-before-my-very-eyes-how-i-almost-got-hacked/">including Nick Bradley</a> , one of the leading employees of the Information Security Department of the Threat Research Group of IBM. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b38/f63/11b/b38f6311babf4a3b8deac511f9e5aa4f.png"><br><br>  ‚ÄúAt about 6:30 pm I was in the middle of the game,‚Äù says Nick.  - Suddenly, I lost control of the mouse and a TeamViewer message appeared in the lower right corner of the screen.  As soon as I understood what was happening, I immediately killed the application.  Then it dawned on me: I have other machines with TeamViewer installed! ‚Äù <br><br>  ‚ÄúI ran down the stairs, where another computer was turned on and worked.  From a distance, I saw that the TeamViewer window had already appeared.  Before I managed to remove it, the attacker launched a browser and opened a new web page.  As soon as I got to the keyboard, I immediately canceled the remote control, immediately went to the TeamViewer site, changed the password and activated two-factor authentication. ‚Äù <br><br>  TeamViewer denies all charges of hacking into its corporate infrastructure.  In her opinion, the reason is the use of the same authorization data by the victims.  The company recommends not to do this, plus the inclusion of two-factor authentication, with regular change of passwords.  Plus, TeamViewer support has <a href="https://www.teamviewer.com/en/company/press/teamviewer-launches-trusted-devices-and-data-integrity/">introduced two new</a> security <a href="https://www.teamviewer.com/en/company/press/teamviewer-launches-trusted-devices-and-data-integrity/">features</a> , including Trusted Devices and Data Integrity. <br><br>  Well, while Microsoft, in the meantime, is trying to speed up the process of switching users to its new OS.  Until the completion of the free update period, there is nothing left, which is why the company is trying.  For example, users are now reporting a new ‚Äúoffer that cannot be refused‚Äù: the Windows 10 update cannot be canceled because ... there is no Cancel button on the update window.  The only options for the user are to change the upgrade time or start it immediately.  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/276784/">Pressing the X button</a> in the upper right corner does not change anything simply because there is no such button.  Since the update cannot be canceled, the only thing that a user can do when this window appears is to update.  At the same time, the company rejects all the allegations, saying that it is impossible to get such a window without choosing ‚Äúupgrade to Windows 10‚Äù on your own and accepting an EULA.  Such a window, as in the preview screenshot, can appear only after performing all these actions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6de/4ab/12f/6de4ab12fd28811a1011eca0b57a4d24.jpg"><br><br>  Watch out for updates worth Samsung laptop owners.  <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/05/31/windows_10_samsung_fail/">As it turned out</a> , on Samsung laptops, Windows 10 doesn't work too well.  So "not too good" that Samsung has officially announced that it does not recommend upgrading to the new OS version for users of its laptops.  The reason for this is clear - the company has not developed a set of drivers specifically for Windows 10. <br><br>  Even the <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/276812/">environmentalists of Africa</a> suffered from the Windows 10 update.  Due to the remoteness of nature conservation organizations from large settlements, it is impossible to work with high-speed Internet.  Instead, slow satellite Internet is used, which is still very expensive.  And so, one of the computers of one of the organizations downloaded about 6 gigabytes of Windows 10 installation files. As a result, this update cost the African volunteers a pretty penny.  Moreover, all this could end even more sadly.  ‚ÄúIf a forced update starts and disables the computer at the moment when we are coordinating the rangers under fire by armed militarized poachers ... the blood will really be on your hands, Microsoft,‚Äù says Reddit user with the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/4mcdon/i_live_in_the_central_african_bush_we_pay_for/">nickname zambuka42</a> . <br><br>  But be that as it may, our PCs continue to be updated, with or without user permission. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/262/b7d/ccf/262b7dccf0194f1286175294330bb317.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/394779/">https://habr.com/ru/post/394779/</a></p>
