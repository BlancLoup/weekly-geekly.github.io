  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Almost correct development on 1C, without revolutions</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Do you know why it is so fashionable to implement <i>Agile / Scrum / Kanban</i> in development teams?  If to be completely honest to the end, the introduction of flexible development methods pursues only one goal - to bring the team closer to the users of the product.  Every two weeks, the developers should not think about design patterns, not whether to choose a new, interesting <i>LinkedList</i> algorithm for implementation, or <i>ArrayList</i> will be enough, and not about how cool <i>protobuf</i> technology <i>will be</i> or not in the project <i>ZeroMQ</i> ;  But about what benefit from this will be the <b>operators</b> working at the enterprise <b>in the warehouse, the loaders and drivers, the turners in the shop and the cashiers-sellers in the store</b> .  In SCRUM, this is usually called the two terms <i>Minimal Valuable Product</i> and <i>Bussiness Value</i> .  By and large, the point is not in fashion, but in efficiency, without prejudice to the comfort of both parties - the business and the IT team. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Theoretical introductory </h4><br>  Before you begin to tell your "failure stories with 1C", I will try to tell a little about DSL languages.  Or rather, about the concept of "problem-oriented languages." <br><br>  <b>Domain Specific Language, DSL - "subject-specific language")</b> - <i>a programming language specialized for a specific application, is the key concept of language-oriented programming.</i> <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">There is no problem, there is a subject</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  In fact, I'm a little sly, giving you the definition of the Russian-language Wikipedia.  Since adding the word ‚Äúproblem‚Äù I try to send you to the original source, where the <a href="http://www.cse.dmu.ac.uk/~mward/martin/papers/middle-out-t.pdf">author Martin Ward formulated the basics of language-oriented programming.</a> <br></div></div><br><br>  Any new language in the world (be it PHP, ruby, python, Erlang, LISP, Closure or 1C) was originally created as a response to the problem.  That is, if you are seriously going to learn any language or ‚Äúframework‚Äù, you need to remember ‚Äúfor what‚Äù the author created it, remember that the author did not like it in other platforms.  In this sense, for example, the story is interesting, as the same <i>Node.JS appeared</i> .  Initially, I wanted to make an easy way to create scalable network servers, to which it degenerated as a result, I think, I already know, the respected habrasoobschestvo.

      <br>
      Therefore, I will talk about the problem of "automating business processes" and the emergence of <i>Business DSL</i> . <br><br><h4>  Enterprise DSL (eDSL) or Business DSL (bDSL) </h4><br>  The main problem that had to be solved in the language of the developer from the 90s was something like this: <br><br><blockquote>  Many people who form a multitude of wishes - everyone wants automation <pre><code class="sql hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">select</span></span> * <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">from</span></span> * <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">as</span></span> requirements</code> </pre>  .  You leave to write in C | C ++ for three months, but they always require something and do not allow to work quietly.  At the same time, most of the business requirements are, firstly, known for a long time, and secondly, they operate on a finite number of objects: ‚ÄúEnter introductory reference information, fix something, calculate something, display a report on the results of calculating something‚Äù and more not necessary. <br></blockquote><br><br>  If, according to <i>TRIZ</i> , the ideal system is a <i>system that does not exist, but its functions are performed</i> , then the ideal DSL language for this seemed like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2ee/d79/a9c/2eed79a9c53748c392b3842f37b27e4e.png"><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">More links to develop an understanding of the problems</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  <a href="https://eclipse.org/Xtext/">How Java programmers solve this problem - or rather try (Eclipse xText)</a> <br>  <a href="http://2014.secr.ru/lang/ru/program/invited-speakers/igor-tkachev">How specifically can this work in a bank (SECR2014)</a> <br>  <a href="https://www.techdays.ru/videos/7402.html">A small report on TechDays explaining the concept (ALMSUMMIT2014)</a> <br></div></div><br><br>  Why in Russian, you ask?  Yes, because the user formulates this way (and most of our users live on exUSSR territory).  As a result, we do not waste time on the formulation of requirements and their transformation to design standards, where the development is conducted in English.  A single dictionary - little adaptation costs.  Effectively? <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">You can by the way, and in Ukrainian, if the user wants</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><br>  // offhand, could be mistaken in writing <br>  System = Install System Automation (); <br><br>  Sistema.ZapustitVvedennyaDov—ñdkovo–Ü–Ünformats—ñ—ó (); <br>  Sistema.ZapustitiObl—ñk Attributkovyh Akkladnyh (); <br>  Sistema.SvoritiHiDovKhDanikhDlyaRosrahunku (); <br>  Sistema.SvoritiZv—ñtiFor Forte (); <br><br>  Sistema.ZapustitiOperator_vNaSklad—ñ (); <br></div></div><br><br><br>  As you understand, as a result, even the user himself can automate a little if he studied Basic at school.  With such a message, the platform under discussion was created, although as it was in reality, only its authors know.  Further in the text I will call this platform, sometimes 1C, and sometimes <b>eDSL.</b>  so that you get used to both concepts and understand that what I mean is the platform, not legal entities. <br><br><h4>  Improving the quality of development and developer level </h4><br>  But as you already understood, you have to pay for everything - having a fast platform for business automation leads us to the fact that from the phrase <b>‚Äúfast, cheap, good - choose any two‚Äù</b> , the eDSL platform makes us choose the side quickly and cheaply.  That is its competitive advantage.  And if you play ‚Äúshort,‚Äù it gives a quick effect, or, on the contrary, a quick understanding of the fallacy of the process (something was automated, it didn't work, it was done differently).  But in any case, further development will be needed - and it is almost NOT possible to develop good products. <br><br>  In order not to lose the speed of development of the final business systems, and to make it better (it became good), the only thing we can do is to start doing it NOT cheap.  And as you understand, there is no money, more precisely, no one will allocate them for the improvement of the quality of a ‚Äúcertain‚Äù platform, which somehow implies that everything is qualitatively in it (according to marketing materials).  Therefore, the only place where we can increase costs is either in the development zone of tools for the 1C platform, or in the development zone of the skills of 1C specialists.  Actually, as soon as we start thinking about the quality of solutions, we begin, like all IT specialists, to try to speed up / simplify our development process, without losing efficiency for the business.  As you understand, this functionality in the platform for business will not exist - it is also a platform for business, and not for the developer. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">To the question that the functional will not be</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  And again, I'm cunning.  In fact, we can say that "not yet."  And the movement in this direction is.  Usually I advise everyone interested to read <a href="http://v8.1c.ru/o7/index.htm">Notes from the coolers</a> at my leisure <a href="http://v8.1c.ru/o7/index.htm">(read the order ‚Äúfrom last to first‚Äù)</a> <br></div></div><br><br>  Well, now in more detail about the toolkit, the one that was created and published, and the one that will be presented in the future. <br><br><h4>  A collection of helpers in working with source codes. </h4><br><h5>  v83unpack (v8unpack-console) - upload in a convenient format the current configuration under development </h5><br>  When you have more than one 1C developer and more than <a href="http://www.v8.1c.ru/overview/DeveloperGroupp.htm">one repository of source configuration files for a business</a> , the first 2 quality problems you want to solve: <br><br><ul><li>  binding code changes to tasks for subsequent analysis of problem situations; </li><li>  the ability to quickly code review, to identify bottlenecks, to the stage of deployment at the client / customer / etc. </li></ul><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">about task management systems</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  It is foolish to assume that in 1C specialists there are no task management systems.  At the moment, I know that there are precedents for industrial use: <br>  1. Jira (Stash, Confluence), TFS2013 <br>  2. OpenProject, Redmine <br>  3. Bitbucket, Github, Taiga.io <br>  even DevProm, and more. <br></div></div><br><br>  How it works? <br><br><pre> <code class="bash hljs">C:\Program Files\1cv82\8.2.15.319\bin\1cv8.exe ENTERPRISE /F<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"C:\Users\admin\.jenkins\workspace\runTest1C\build\ibService"</span></span> /Nadmin /P1 /DisableStartupMessages /Execute<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"C:\Users\admin\temp\.epf"</span></span> /C<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"decompile;pathToCF;C:\1cv8.cf;pathOut;C:\repo\git\src;auto;out;C:\Users\admin\.jenkins\workspace\runTest1C\outExport.txt;"</span></span></code> </pre><br><br>  Using the <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/FSTrigger%2BPlugin">Jenkins build server plugin</a> as a monitoring tool for the source code file, we get a complete replica of the development history of the configuration in the form of a git repository. <br><br>  <a href="https://bitbucket.org/Shenja/elementaltrade/src/a018bb29fe2e7edb59188cc25bb7771516ba99ad/src/Document/%25D0%259F%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D1%2589%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F%25D0%25A2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0/ObjectModule.txt%3Fat%3Dmaster">Now the "older comrades" always see poor-quality code or not taking into account the approaches to the correct development</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/601/60e/c5d/60160ec5dbad4364965326e8111e2dbd.png"><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">why by the way git</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  first, only Git maintains the <a href="http://v8.1c.ru/erp/">volume of ERP 2.0 source codes</a> <br>  and secondly, only Git has a convenient concept of collective work on a variety of ‚Äúcontexts‚Äù of GitFlow tasks, which is critical for 1C specialist as it allows you to manage the ‚Äúchaos of demands from the user‚Äù without causing chaos in the code. <br></div></div><br><br><h5>  precommit1c - fixing external tools in git repositories as source files </h5><br>  It is wrong to assume that the work of a regular developer goes only with the 1C storage, the quality problem, including arises from the fact that most developers write a very large number of small utilities in the form of external files intended to run in the platform environment.  When you have one developer, then <i>Dropbox / YandexDisk / GoogleDrive / etc</i> saves you for versioning, but when you work in a team, git and the internal or external git repository save us again. <br><br>  The work goes through the git client "hooks" and "suddenly" requires Python (although you can also on bash): <br><br><pre> <code class="bash hljs">git <span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">clone</span></span> ssh://git@dev.example.org/operational-managment/goods-trade ./my-goods-trade git submodule add https://github.com/xDrivenDevelopment/precommit1c ./my-goods-trade/vendors/precommit1c <span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">cd</span></span> ./my-goods-trade/vendors/precommit1c <span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">exec</span></span> copy-to-hook.cmd <span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">cd</span></span> ../../ mkdir utils &amp;&amp; cp /cygdrive/d/epfs/.epf ./utils git commit .epf -m <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">'   '</span></span> git push --all</code> </pre><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">what's going on here</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  By default, I believe that the <b>habrasoobschestvo</b> can read the command line, for the rest I will explain: <br>  0.

On <i><b><a href="http://infostart.ru/">HabreDlya1Snikov</a></b></i> - <a href="http://infostart.ru/public/19633/">this development</a> is included in the Top-20 <br><br>  The range of application of this utility is wide: <br><ul><li>  novice experts use it to repair and view damaged databases in the internal format of the platform; </li><li>  and also, if the platform also stores a lot of data in the temp directories in the internal format, then for the study of the time data of the platform. </li></ul><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Wow - their bases are crumbling.</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Destruction and problem situations are most often not associated with platform problems, but with an attempt not to invest in hardware resources.  That is, when, instead of setting up the infrastructure for a solution on 1C, the database continues to be located on the computer <i>under the table of the</i> developer.  I usually try to give an example from the world of <i>sqlite</i> for analogy - imagine how many problems you will encounter if you start using <i>sqlite</i> as a means of storing data in a system with the number of simultaneously working users, say 10 and the size of the database is from 1 Gb.  For those who want to learn this useful but painful experience, one should begin with the fact that competitive access in this case is extremely desirable in the format of <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4060772/sqlite3-concurrent-access">"many readers - one writer</a> . <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4060772/sqlite3-concurrent-access">"</a> <br></div></div><br><br>  With regard to improving the quality of development and developer, then there is <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">a synergy effect</a> , due to the fact that the source code repository 1C platform is also a data repository, it is with the help of <b>Tool1CD</b> that the git repository is replicated. <br><br>  So, now we have a complete history of all 1C developers in the git repository, and note, without negatively affecting the actual process of ‚Äúcoding‚Äù on the platform. <br><br><h4>  We process the development process, without losing the speed of release of new functionality </h4><br>  Further need only in the following cases: <br><br><ul><li>  Configuration 1C solutions will exist in your area of ‚Äã‚Äãresponsibility for a long time - from a month or more; </li><li>  You are trying to implement automated testing before you submit your work / system to an internal or external customer; </li><li>  You are just an IT perfectionist. </li></ul><br><br>  <i>DevOps</i> engineers <i>are</i> very fond of <i>Chef, puppet</i> , but they absolutely do not like 1C, so we start automating our own activities. <br><br>  <b>1Script</b> - already <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/223887/">known project</a> on Habr√©.  In order not to repeat the article <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/evilbeaver/" class="user_link">EvilBeaver</a> , I will only say that the current result in the form of a DSL language for automating the work of ‚Äúordinary‚Äù 1C specialists looks like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/144/71d/186/14471d1864834f2db6ab1da7e2609b61.png"><br><br>  <b>xUnitFor1C</b> - development through testing for 1C.  The most interesting project in terms of quality improvement is that it gives the maximum effect.  In fact, it is the implementation of the xUnit specification with the specifics of 1C, and requires a separate publication (which will be next after the current one).  The key thing to note here is that the introduction of development through testing (TDD on 1C) requires the highest costs in the first stage: the effect is observed no earlier than 1.5 months later. <br><br>  <b>Snegopat</b> - your ReShaper and not only. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">subtleties of the project</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Here I have to say that at the moment ‚Äútemporarily‚Äù the development of the project has stopped.  So to say "stopped" in anticipation - also because of the <a href="https://snegopat.ru/forum/viewtopic.php%3Ff%3D1%26t%3D667">architectural problems of the first version</a> . <br></div></div><br><br>  But in order to start the practice of using the above tools, most 1C specialists start with simpler projects: <br><br>  <b>v8Reader</b> - the <a href="https://github.com/xDrivenDevelopment/v8Reader">assistant of association when resolving conflicts in collective development</a> <br>  <b>v8Viewer</b> - <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/v8reader/">an assistant that is embedded, including in TortoiseGIT, for comparing versions 1C of the configuration located in the git repository</a> <br><br>  This is it, ‚Äúthe world of eDSL‚Äù, where the main thing is the automation of business processes, and everything else is <a href="http://eax.me/micro-service-architecture/">microservices and microutilities</a> , produced under the <i>Apache License 2.0</i> license <br><br><h4>  To life "raspberries did not seem" </h4><br>  Let's expand our horizons in terms of <i>heterogeneous</i> development: <br><br>  <b>1C + OpenStack</b> - relation to 1C as a <i>‚Äúpackage‚Äù for a cloud platform</i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2fc/150/46f/2fc15046fd1a4abe9c0325f6e7ed45ed.png"><br><br>  <b>1C + Docker</b> - related to 1C as a <i>‚Äúcollection of containers‚Äù</i> . <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8e9/ce3/539/8e9ce35398cf47388c009c3c1b97939b.png"><br><br>  And of course, <b>1C + logstash / kibana / elasticsearch</b> - besides just journaling, is also used for BI. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dc4/5be/0be/dc45be0be58f410882c3d1ca8138de68.png"><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">where is php</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  I draw your attention that I have a bias towards PHP, so I can‚Äôt give you links to products that work with PHP in the same style considering the possibilities of both 1C and PHP, combining the advantages of both platforms: my personal opinion is that PHP is <i><b>P</b> ersonal <b>H</b> ome <b>P</b> age tools</i> and do not assure me of the opposite. <br></div></div><br><br><h4>  As a conclusion </h4><br>  In the world of 1C developers - I really ask you to pay attention to the word ‚Äúdevelopment‚Äù, as an alternative to the words ‚Äúconsultation and implementation‚Äù - there have long been no clean 1C specialists.  This is, let's say, a myth from the 2000s.  Most programmers who professionally create solutions on the 1C platform already have one of the older languages ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äúin their base‚Äù: Java, C # or ruby, python is a business requirement and cannot get away from it, including through the huge domestic market of projects CIS countries.  And, of course, due to the very dynamic development of the platform itself.  On the other hand, the problems of non-quality developers are present everywhere, regardless of language / platform, and this already leads us to the field of psychology and the answer to the question ‚Äúwhy people do not develop and why people for the most part do not understand their place in the IT world‚Äù .  But this is the topic of another article and other methods / tools. <br><br>  At the same time, as usual, given the openness of licenses, the <a href="https://github.com/xDrivenDevelopment">github.com/xDrivenDevelopment</a> community is open to new ideas and utilities as part of the concept of a weighted approach to eDSL platforms - just without the very revolutions mentioned in the title. <br><br><h4>  FAQ </h4><br>  <b>Q: And here Agile?</b> <br>  <b>A:</b> eDSL due to the concept in principle of ‚ÄúAgile itself‚Äù (RAD platform), its concept does not contain anything about QA (product quality management) - therefore, when introducing flexibility on 1C, you should pay key attention not to ‚Äúcustomer demonstration‚Äù , and more on the introduction of engineering practices. <br><br>  <b>Q: How does all this start to use?</b>  <b>And then "our 1C" experts @ cencored @</b> <br>  <b>A:</b> Download, install the build server (Jenkins | Teamcity), run the compilation of the solution at night (‚Äúsyntax control of the code‚Äù) using 1Script scripts.

Come to AgileDays2015 - see how to use <a href="http://msk15.agiledays.ru/members/profile/868/">static code analyzers</a> . <br><br>  <b>Q: How much money does it cost?</b> <br>  <b>A:</b> Better think how much it saves on 1C long projects. <br><br>  <b>Q: But it does not meet the standards of 1C?</b> <br>  <b>A:</b> These tools automate standards and extend them.
