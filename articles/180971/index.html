      <b>VIDEO</b> <br>  The application will be able to create photos and videos using the camera at any time without your permission. <br><br>  <b>RECORD AUDIO</b> <br>  Record audio. <br><br>  Maybe someone did not read or read, but somehow he didn‚Äôt really think about the consequences of this company policy. <br><br>  Unfortunately, the vigilance of many is completely lost, after 5-10 years Google will collect such a stratum of statistics, who is in what mood, with what facial expression, at the same time he writes what he says and how the situation behaves, what pulse, etc.  For example, when viewing an advertisement or service.  Then it will analyze, the concentration of people in cities, the density in buildings, compare it with emotional components, combine it into one array of information, and it will happen that a cloudy creature named Google will know everything about everything, integrates additional services in the process, integrates more more tightly into the lives of all people. <br><br>  Imagine a gyroscope, and an accelerometer, a magnetic field sensor in a device for relatively little money, from where and why such generosity? <br>  and why such jewelry accuracy?  Hardly for users, and hardly for games. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  In one of the posts on Habr√©, the algorithm was described as when reading the beats and tilts of the tablet, when typing text on it you can with 70% probability of recognizing what was actually typed.  And this is only the tip of the iceberg, the ability to read the password itself and the typed text is more interesting not for Google, since they already have full access to information, but ordinary fraudsters. <br><br>  But what Google can do with such an arsenal of sensors in the multi-million dollar circulation is in everyone‚Äôs pocket, and soon on the head (for example, google glass), in the future, probably right in the eye or under the eye, then how it goes.  This is another question. <br><br>  A creature named Google is quite able to possessing a huge amount of information in different planes (time, place in space, audio and visual streams, linking all of the telemetry to a specific person) to easily prevent any action of the average person or the mass of people. <br><br>  Studying the quality of microphones, gyros, compass and accelerometer on my tablet, I am amazed at the quality and sensitivity of these sensors.  Having the necessary algorithms that I‚Äôm sure are already working, you can use parameters such as hand shake (if you know, the pulse is well fixed by both the gyroscope and accelerometer, if you hold a tablet or phone in your hand) to determine your pulse, if you know the principle of the lie detector , you should understand that you do not want to be constantly under the detector, but it is necessary or already necessary. <br><br>  I still do not understand the <b>sensor for changing the Earth‚Äôs magnetic field,</b> why it is needed in a tablet, some phenomenon that is not yet clear to science and Google itself can influence the psychophysical state of a person, the Earth‚Äôs magnetic field, as it is known all over the planet is different, more precisely with different zones and anomalies.  And to collect this really important information, a corporation can afford to install this sensor into your device at our expense. <br><br>  <b>Microphones are</b> so sensitive that during the day, given the noise of the city outside the window, the tablet captures well the sound of the second hand of the wall clock, this is a normal quartz watch that is not mechanical, which is not heard with your ear.  Accordingly, these Google ears are well aware of all conversations, even at a great distance from the microphone.  By tracking sighs and ahs, you can tell a lot about a person and his condition as well as predict his behavior and actions. <br><br>  <b>Photo and video</b> is also an additional piece of your information field.  Having the ability to shoot this information without your knowledge, the Google creature looks at you when you laugh, bite your nails or bite your lip and already know that at that moment you are experiencing tension, having read the sound from the microphone in parallel, knows the sound background or what you or they tell you  Knowing all this is made up of your psychological portrait, personality portrait. <br><br>  Knowledge is a great power.  Having knowledge of a person about his verbal and non-verbal signals, one can easily find all his weak points, but we are not saying that all this is for the sake of humanity, right?  This is intended to be controlled.  And in the future to monopolize the world.  It may sound at the wrong time, it might have been necessary to be alarmed before, but earlier it was not so severe and not so total, for example, all the same radio points throughout the country turned off everything, and that‚Äôs all control.  Then there was a radio, the same thing took out the batteries and you are free, it coped with the brainwashing of the people for a long time, then the television, it‚Äôs already more difficult, having turned off the TV you don‚Äôt watch your favorite program or series, well I watched a couple of news stories and commercials , but this is the very thing when the victim does not know that she is the victim. <br><br>  And so fate gave humanity Internet and wireless telephony.  In skillful hands, this is a great tool, we all know well about the positive side of these tools, but since we are all just users, this whole system and we prefer to consider ourselves free when surfing the Internet.  In fact, all this is not done for our well-being, I think this is understandable.  No system or service is made to help.  (Except for actually existing non-profit charitable organizations) Any developed service pursues its own goals, but if the service shouts that it serves the public good, then these are just words. <br><br>  <b>Any service is a business</b> and the goals are always the same: money and power. <br>  Giant corporations have a lot of money, and having more wealth is not the goal.  The goal is to control the masses of people, money is first a tool to start, and then money becomes only a side effect of controlling the masses. <br><br>  <b>As an example:</b> <br>  Already, gesture control is embedded in televisions, the next step is computers, home systems and smart home.  In the near future, the line between devices will be erased, and everything will be reduced to a single device, a sort of media library or media center, which is located as I would like at home, but with great speed, cloud services are taking up positions and all media libraries will be imposed on us remotely for money. and on an ongoing basis, instead of buying a server once and not owing it to anyone for a place somewhere there.  So, there is one media center, and a network of displays with motion sensors and cameras scattered around the house, and one console (essentially a tablet PC, or a smartphone) with which the control takes place, while walking around the house, scanners read your movement knowing where and in what place you are, and switch the active image to the display where you are.  Your condition is also recorded as described above. <br><br>  And you scratched behind your ear, and a message appears on the display, or a friendly virtual assistant says your heart palpitations, the pupils are not like that.  Drink these pills.  You answer him saying, thank you, but go to the bathhouse.  The system recognizes aggression in your voice, compares the statistics and your data archive, and concludes that you need to lie down to calm down, and if you refuse, the system will have to disperse calming gas or call the orderlies and force you by law to keep you in jail for 10 days, as judging by schedule you planned to be at the dog show on Wednesday, but most likely in the hall you can cross with an important guest from Japan, and there is a possibility of your nervous breakdown that will lead to a possible conflict. <br><br>  And there is no guarantee that this will happen, but if you trust such a system in the future, you can simply stop being a person, lose all your rights to freedom at birth. <br><br>  The cage is already narrow enough and the rods have become even more dense next to it, but there is still an opportunity to get out of this cage. <br>  I mean the system as a whole.  People created the world in the World and imposed this pseudo world as a reality and an irrefutable fact, the only way to exist.  Cities, telephones, the Internet, television, schools, hospitals, everything works totally with one goal to control, a side effect is the observation and direction of individuals and the masses in the right direction. <br><br>  Total knowledge and control over humanity will simply give an excellent corporate advantage over you as a person, you will sell what you do not need, under the guise of the most important nonsense in your life, and you will buy and depend. <br><br>  Immediately you advertise the club and the party together with the bern imposing that this is the only thing that can give you such grandiose impressions, then advertise vodka with beer, then when you do it all and having walked in the club completely forgot about the goals of existence, family and self-development, you they offer hangover pills, and antidepressants, then pills for bloating, and gluttony, when pills go around a feast. <br><br>  Think yourself, this is already a reality, it seems ridiculous, but so far it‚Äôs so, after some time it will be sad and insulting that they have behaved in this way and allowed themselves to be mocked at it, and this is what we see now TV ads, etc. over this was many years ago, now the consequences. <br>  The same goes for the problem of gyroscopes and cameras with microphones and the Internet, only the consequences are even darker and even heavier-output. <br><br>  <b>And Google is very quickly and brazenly all this promotes under the guise of a delicious cake.</b> <br><br>  It would be all right if people had a choice: to give or not permission to take photos and videos without the permission of the device owner. <br>  And in general, in Android applications it is necessary that permissions can be given selectively. <br>  This is a trifle, you allow everything in one fell swoop for one application or selectively in each application your list of permissions.  But this is the catch, ‚Äúimperceptibly‚Äù obliging everyone to seem to be able to track and take pictures, as it were with permission. <br><br>  Although there <b>should be selective acceptance or non-acceptance of individual permits.</b> <br><br>  There is another option, the refusal of Google services completely.  This is the most difficult for many. <br>  But this is the only option.  Mass failure, but this is not a one-year story, such events affect for more than one hundred years, so, as always, you must remain human and try, if not to resist, then at least not to take poisonous apples from such monsters. <br><br>  The article is intended to sober up the mind, share thoughts and believe that there are people who think the same way, who see injustice in the World, see the power of the minority (as you know most of the money and power is in a very narrow circle relative to the entire population) over the majority. <br>  I consider it my duty to write and express my opinion, and if it coincides with the opinion of others it will speak about a possible victory in the future over the system, at least it will be not one person and not one opinion. <br><br>  Thanks to everyone who read to the end, glad if I read the positive reviews.  This will show how much a creature named Google parasitized the population.  Although I honestly am a longtime user of Google, from the very moment gmail appeared and I received an invite to register an account, but I don‚Äôt welcome what a merry google brand turns into. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/180971/">https://habr.com/ru/post/180971/</a></p>
