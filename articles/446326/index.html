Let's talk about the observance of traffic rules and their solutions. <br><br>  Immediately, I note that I do not advertise the finished product: I myself cannot realize this, since this requires a large amount of finance, specialists, and communications in the state.  structures, etc. But the idea is ready to give to any person or company that can realize it. <br><br><h4>  Actually, where did the idea start </h4><br>  If you drive 200 to 300 kilometers from the major cities of Moscow and St. Petersburg, you can witness that traffic violations are violated by every third driver.  For a long time I lived and studied in the city of Almaty (Kazakhstan), in connection with which, violation of the traffic rules is very striking. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In Kazakhstan, everything is very strictly in compliance with the traffic rules: for example, if in the Russian Federation a fine in violation of the speed limit is 300 rubles.  (250 with a discount + 50 commission when paying from the phone), then in Kazakhstan you will pay 3636 rubles.  (20000 tenge at the rate of 5.5 tenge to the ruble) for speeding by 20 km / h.  Attention: the data on fines I take from memory a year ago.

      About parking at the place of a disabled person and a fine of 18181 rubles (!) (Eighteen thousand rubles), etc., I probably will not say, but I think 2 things become clear: <br><br><ol><li>  All drivers in the major cities of Kazakhstan follow traffic regulations to the maximum extent possible; </li><li>  Corruption in the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Kazakhstan is flourishing (simply because it is more profitable to pay 1000 rubles on hands than 3636 officially).  Although this does not work with cameras anymore. </li></ol><br>  Since in the Russian Federation fines for compliance with the rules of the road are minimal, most people violate traffic rules.  I perfectly understand the position that, for example, in Moscow, if you don‚Äôt break, you won‚Äôt come anywhere, but I would like to talk not about Moscow, but about the cities behind it - traffic violations are just at every turn. <br><br>  <b>For example:</b> <br><br>  - a sharp stop in front of the car (both legs on the floor on the brake), because the driver just noticed a place to park.  However, he did not give any warning signals in advance; <br>  - almost complete disregard for the use of turn signals (the game is ‚Äúguess the maneuver‚Äù); <br>  - complete inability to keep the lane when cornering and turning; <br>  - misunderstanding who should skip whom on the circle; <br>  - misunderstanding how to use the turn signals on the circle; <br>  - driving in the style of "my car is more expensive - I have a priority in the movement"; <br>  - passage to red every second (I don‚Äôt even speak about passage to yellow - this is the norm); <br>  - ignoring signs prohibiting movement along a certain lane (for example, the lane is only to the left - <b>everyone</b> goes straight); <br>  - it is normal, for example, in our city to go immediately against one-way traffic under a brick and at the same time to signal that it would be missed; <br>  - I don‚Äôt think about sticking rooms with snow or paper on the parking places (parking in cities 200-400 km from St. Petersburg and Moscow is 20 rubles per hour, not 60-300 rubles, like in Moscow).  With that, they often glue the cars for the cost of 5-6 million rubles  (with a monthly subscription of 3,000 rubles); <br>  - witnessed a detour traffic (300 meters traffic jam) on the sidewalk (the sidewalk was behind iron railings), scaring people with wheelchairs, and driving on a red route taxi with a full load right in front of the patrol car.  The patrol car pretended that nothing exceptional had happened. <br><br>  I can continue indefinitely.  But back to the idea. <br><br><h3>  Idea </h3><br>  In connection with these observations, an idea arose of how to improve the situation with roads in the country. <br><br>  <a href="http://pravo-auto.com/kuda-otpravit-video-i-foto-s-narusheniem-pdd/">There is an opportunity to send a message about traffic violations</a> <br><br>  But it is rather difficult to do this, as it is necessary: <br><br><ol><li>  Pull out the camera and take a picture on the phone, which when driving a vehicle is at least inconvenient and can also lead to another accident; </li><li>  Remove the USB flash drive from the video recording camera on the car, insert it into the computer, find the video you need, edit it in order not to send 5 minutes of recording - compress the video file; </li><li>  Make a message about the accident by attaching a video or snapshot. </li></ol><br>  It will take a lot of time, and if you want to do video fixing all the time, it puts a fat point on this issue, because it will take you hours of time each time just to make a request. <br><br>  How to solve the issue quickly and easily: use a ready-made tool for this <br><br><h4>  Tool </h4><br>  - from the state  the structures conclude a contract (so that all this is by law); <br>  - a website is created on which each motorist can register by entering his personal data (preferably with a passport confirmation, etc.) + license + vehicle number; <br>  - a special camera, pre-created by the manufacturer, is purchased, certified camera in the car (based on ordinary cameras, but with modifications) and installed in the car; <br>  - in order not to be distracted from the traffic situation, a separate button is also installed to send data to the dashboard or to the steering wheel if the button is wireless; <br>  - as soon as the driver noticed a violation of traffic rules, he presses the button and the device cuts the last minute of the video recording, converts it into the required format and sends it indicating the driver's id to the video-fixing server. <br><br><h4>  Technical implementation </h4><br>  - A camera is taken that can shoot video; <br>  - is being finalized before shooting in high resolution so that the numbers of the intruder are visible; <br>  - SIM card or Wi-Fi support is being finalized (a SIM card is needed so that you can send video right away when you press a button, Wi-Fi so that the video is sent, for example, when a car drives to a house: the camera catches Wi-Fi and sends the accumulated video data when connected to the Internet); <br>  - a special software that allows you to find out the id of the camera and associate it with the driver data, as well as update the camera software; <br>  - a site where you can register by entering your data and camera id and get information about the application (how many accidents are recorded, how much money was received, etc.); <br>  - those.  support and video processing service (many will say that there will be a lot of video and it is unrealistic to process everything, but I remind you that the <a href="https://tass.ru/obschestvo/5922166">President of Tatarstan said:</a> ‚ÄúStatistics show that because of this, we are losing 3 billion rubles for 2018 only ...‚Äù cancellation of discounts on fines, i.e., in this area such money is spinning, that 500-5000 people can be put into video processing, who will handle video violations in manual mode or develop an intelligent system for recognition of violations - there will be enough money!). <br><br><h4>  Bonuses to the driver </h4><br>  Since not everyone will spend their money on a device for the sake of helping society, the best solution would be to pay rewards to the driver who sent the video, for example, in the amount of 5-20% of the penalty of violation, which he recorded.  Even if it will allow to earn 2-3 thousand rubles per month, it will already be the payment of gasoline and the motivation of drivers to fix traffic violations. <br><br><h3>  Pros of implementation </h3><br>  - violators will <b>always</b> remember that at <b>any</b> time their violation can be filmed by <b>any</b> car; <br>  - It will be difficult to identify the person who sent the video.  It is clear that all bases, of course, as usual, will be sold by company employees, but if the bases have 100-200 thousand drivers, then it will be difficult to identify a specific person.  And since the processing of the received video usually takes 1-2 weeks, it becomes even more difficult. <br><br><h3>  Moral issue </h3><br>  - I understand perfectly well that now fans of fast driving and defenders of violations under various pretexts will run into the comments, but I see an example of the fact that in Kazakhstan (I heard that in other countries as well) tight control allows achieving correct driving and reducing mortality and injuries of random people; <br>  - the safety of me and my family is more important for me than the opinion of people who believe that I am wrong; <br>  - <a href="https://www.gazeta.ru/auto/2017/12/11_a_11326058.shtml">In August, about two thousand people died on the Russian roads in an accident</a> , and more than 21.2 thousand were injured.  Thus, as suggested by Gazeta.Ru, the last month of summer has so far become the most ‚Äúemergency‚Äù since the beginning of this year.  In just eight months, almost 11 thousand people died in accidents, and almost 132 thousand more were injured. <br><br>  Pay attention to a simple fact: <b>for 8 months of</b> 2018, 11 (eleven) thousand people died only in the Russian Federation in an accident.  A simple example: <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2590%25D1%2584%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B9%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0_(1979%25E2%2580%25941989)">15 thousand people died</a> in Afghanistan in 10 (!) Years.  Those.  in a war for almost ten years, fewer people die than in a traffic accident in 1 year - this is about the moral side. <br><br>  Those.  The system is interesting and beneficial to all, except for violators. <br><br>  - we get a decrease in the number of accidents on the roads, which means safety for ourselves and our loved ones; <br>  - The state receives additional money in the budget; <br>  - System members earn money for the same gasoline; <br>  - A company that implements this scheme will also earn a lot of money. <br><br>  The idea is free - I give it to everyone who can implement it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/446326/">https://habr.com/ru/post/446326/</a></p>
