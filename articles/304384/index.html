I love the web, the ‚Äúlovable word JS‚Äù game, spontaneous forays with friends on nature.  And with these attacks, the same problem often arose: when thrown in for 14‚Äì15 people, it was difficult to understand who and how much money should later ... <br><br>  Practicing new technology for myself, I also wrote a small utility whose task is to simplify life in such cases.  This is how the tiny site <a href="http://chip-in.me/">chip-in.me appeared</a> .  Everything is very simple: we enter people, their contribution to the total purchase (only with equal shares!), Press the button and get the result - who, to whom and how much should give money, with names and amounts.  The result can be shared with friends. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8c7/8ab/bf8/8c78abbf83b440c6993591ec83183d56.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/934/277/2c6/9342772c69a547b2a845fd4a98b09379.png">

    <h2>  Technical details </h2><br>  The choice was made in favor of Polymer.  And that's why: <br><br><ul><li>  This is google.  Those.  most likely the product is quality and will be promoted in the market.  Being on the wave is useful. </li><li>  Polymer is an add-on for web components, which means that it will probably be in demand in the near future, it is good to have experience by that moment. </li><li>  The product at that time was updated to a stable version 1.0.0 - you can safely use it. </li></ul><br>  You can read more about Polymer in my article <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/dataart/blog/270109/">here</a> . <br><br>  The <a href="http://chip-in.me/">chip-in.me</a> application is a set of independent components with isolated logic, layout and styles.  Technically, there are three different files in a folder for a separate component.  The collector assembles all parts into two files: html and js.  Further, these files are connected to index.html.  Of course, the Polymer library is preloaded into the application. <br><br>  By the way, Google took care of unit testing and created a handy utility <a href="https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/docs/tools/tests">Web Component Tester</a> . <br><br><h2>  Implementation difficulties </h2><br><ul><li>  It is worth getting used to the logic.  The two-way binding for arrays is not immediately obvious.  But understanding comes quickly enough. </li><li>  Initially, it was not obvious to me why Polymer and polyfills are connected in this way. </li><li>  When the program was written, for Gulp there was no Vulcanize wrapper yet (Polymer utility for code minification).  I had to write myself, it turned out to be easy. </li><li>  Alas, I never managed to run the application on the old Android.  Polymer is based on web components that are not supported by older browsers.  And even polyfill. </li><li>  There were problems with blur and focus for input elements. </li><li>  <a href="http://parse.com/">Parse.com is</a> used as data <a href="http://parse.com/">storage</a> , which will be closed at the end of 2016. You will have to search for a new storage or do it locally.  But that's another story. </li></ul><br><br><h2>  The final application <a href="http://chip-in.me/">chip-in.me</a> is: </h2><br><ul><li>  The main index.html. </li><li>  Html-file for all components (there all styles). </li><li>  JavaScript file for all the logic of all components. </li><li>  The application depends on the Polymer components and the library itself, it‚Äôs all in a separate folder. </li></ul><br><br>  Since its launch (summer 2015), about 800 people have visited the application site.  The average time spent by the user on the site is about two minutes. <br><br>  It was nice to get acquainted with Polymer, and he coped with the task superbly.  The Polymer slogan sounds like "There is an element for that" ("There is a component for this").  And he was clearly chosen by chance.  Everything is quite simple and simple, even though there are small bugs and blind spots in the library. <br><br>  The application code can be found here: <br>  <a href="https://github.com/DataArt/chip-in-calculator">https://github.com/DataArt/chip-in-calculator</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/304384/">https://habr.com/ru/post/304384/</a></p>
