The days of lonely, brilliant developers passed like rains on a mountain.  Now the games were created by huge teams with huge development time and huge budgets. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f2c/412/860/f2c41286046c4ad98b30a2dfd81f7e78.jpg"><br>  <i>Assassin's Creed: Revelation Development Team</i> <br><br>  Big budgets require big profits, and big profits need less risk. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/496/aad/076/496aad0760484bc4b7fe8fce5a96234a.png"><br>  <i>Sales of video games by year</i> <br><br>  My dream job turned into a nightmare.  I worked more and got less than my non-programmer friends because of the privilege of being a game developer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5cc/abb/b1b/5ccabbb1bfcd432fb1dfca73eab96c28.png"><br>  <i>Comparison of average wages</i> <br><br>  But I did not make games, but only their small pieces. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ac9/2d5/1aa/ac92d51aa4184d07bbc39809b1613d4c.jpg"><br><br>  Therefore, I became a manager.  I thought that more leadership means more creative management.  But it was not so.  I still did not make games, I even stopped making pieces of games.  I created schedules, budgets and meetings. <br><br>  And I left. <br><br>  Then I started making Flash games, just for fun. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d60/c51/779/d60c517796f94e47acb6560adbf7fa1e.jpg"><br><br>  In Flash, you can write code and create pictures in the same place.  The games were small and specific.  You could make a good game yourself.  And Flash was supported everywhere, so you could put the game on public display. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/50a/196/e08/50a196e089804fa18cade5a2f01c82b6.jpg"><br><br>  It was a dream come true.  It was possible to make the whole game, not just pieces.  They could be as strange, funny, or experimental as I wanted.  It was not necessary to sweat over schedules, budgets, meetings. <br><br>  Then the dream became even better - it turned out that my games began to earn a little. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/045/b30/a42/045b30a42158474295f6599df770416a.jpg"><br><br>  Then came the iPhone, and suddenly there was an opportunity to make a lot of money.  It was a rebirth, a second chance.  For the first time since the early 80s, one programmer, or a small group of people, could make a living by creating amazing wonders that made people smile and expand their ideas about the possibilities of games. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1ee/652/0c7/1ee6520c797843d9a8c3cb2b375dc458.jpg"><br><br>  It was another golden era.  For others. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/591/0f1/d5a/5910f1d5a9a3455788df8ac38c3fab5a.png"><br>  <i>Fez by Phil Fish</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/46c/db9/c9a/46cdb9c9aaf64c32afc5fe5ec7da5cf1.jpg"><br>  <i>Limbo by playdead</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/81f/d45/a83/81fd45a8305e4e7db6fe749c5bf1d3b0.png"><br>  <i>Minecraft by notch</i> <br><br>  And for me. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d25/3d4/194/d253d41942084509862aa545752c3f31.jpg"><br>  <i>House of shadows</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/53c/e59/97d/53ce5997d02d4dde96f3803d972c5912.jpg"><br>  <i>Doug dug</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/885/563/c97/885563c9775542dab737d59c95441279.jpg"><br>  <i>pixa</i> <br><br>  And then it suddenly ended. <br><br>  So many people broke into riveting games for the iPhone, that an explosive increase in supply occurred, and prices collapsed.  It became impossible to sell games. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/332/8c8/39a/3328c839a0c045bc8e782b63b54a9078.png"><br>  <i>Number of apps on the App Store</i> <br><br>  Soon, earning on games was obtained only from those who turned their games into bulletin boards or markets. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0a8/1ab/45c/0a81ab45c95d4f6f826c560f86ff5d2e.jpg"><br>  <i>Dragon vale</i> <br><br>  This is the opposite of creativity, the opposite of art.  And the fun of these games has become, though contagious, but empty, as if you are sucking sugar through a straw. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/44f/188/88c/44f18888cec44a4ba08e98698477fb13.jpg"><br>  <i>Candy crush</i> <br><br>  Even small groups from independent studios were not innovative, beautiful or humane.  These were machines that cling to the human brain and feed it with chemicals that drive the brain into a trance. <br><br>  And I left. <br><br>  Now making games is my hobby, like with millions of others.  Just a hobby.  The development of small games did not die at all.  Sometimes the game causes a response, and the authors collect awards for several months. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/43e/668/fe6/43e668fe65f14a70a320e449933d0cba.jpg"><br>  <i>Monument</i> <br><br>  But no one lives on it.  Zynga, Rovio: today is the stars, tomorrow - the cleaners. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a7c/12a/ce4/a7c12ace4b4042429db06ccb72df848d.jpg"><br><br>  If your game shoots, there will always be thousands of hungry developers who will want to steal the idea and release it in a new package. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c9e/ca7/cae/c9eca7cae61f4a9fb95dffd635784274.jpg"><br>  <i>Threes vs 2048</i> <br><br>  Creating small and beautiful games is no longer work.  But this is a great hobby.  Competitions to create a game for 48 hours like Ludum Dare adorn my life. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e8b/b92/3ab/e8bb923ab07a4204ac3f495dc4f1b4ee.jpg"><br>  <i>Connected worlds</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bf1/aa5/42e/bf1aa542e43d47e9b1bd3cdb63d9b50a.jpg"><br>  <i>Proletarian ninja X</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/66f/6de/ea4/66f6deea4210434b9edde1839ed13063.png"><br>  <i>Claustrophobia</i> <br><br>  I am so excited during these 48 hours that it is difficult for me to calm down.  When I was in college, we were told that there would always be demand for developers.  In general, it is.  I always thought that it would be a time when this statement would cease to be true, when the need for developers would subside and programming could not make a living. <br><br>  Now I know. <br><br>  For single game programmers, this day has already arrived.  Twice. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/375491/">https://habr.com/ru/post/375491/</a></p>
