Almost anywhere in the civilized world, observers do not rush around the site to take instrument readings ‚Äî everything that is possible is automated.  In Russia, they relied on this, but thanks to the Rosgidromet modernization project, the meteorological network re-equipment happened.  There was no such scale anywhere and never, but we implemented the project in just two years (2008‚Äì2009).  And this, for a minute, the delivery of 1842 meteorological stations plus other coherent and energy cladding.  It was also necessary to assemble the stations, assemble and pack them, deliver them to each of the 85 regional centers, and from there take them to the stations, install and configure them. <br><br>  At the moment, the second stage of modernization is in full swing.  Excavations in the archives of documents and gave me the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãsuch a post.

Geography of Roshydromet weather stations</font></i> <br><br>  In general, the whole project of modernization of organizations and institutions of Roshydromet consisted of several contracts: on meteorology, hydrology, aerology, oceanology, etc. Then I will show photos that relate to the most remarkable of them. <br><br>  The part of the project that we covered included the supply of equipment for more than 2,000 objects of the observation network and the installation of more than 500 sites. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0095b6">1. Meteo-network</font> </h2><br><h3>  <font color="#0095b6">Equipment</font> </h3><br>  To implement the project, LANIT became a manufacturer of weather stations.  We decided that we would develop this production on our own on the basis of the Luch plant in Novosibirsk.  Components were brought from all over the world, we also received Russian components (with them, by tradition, there were the most problems). <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5fb/d5c/461/5fbd5c4619ffb60895f103f848f64bc5.png"></div>  <i><font color="#999999">Novosibirsk, Luch plant.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">Production of our equipment</font></i> <br><br>  The factory organized a whole assembly line, which employed 10-15 people.  For this, we several times brought crowds of specialists on the organization of production from the company Vaisala, who shared their knowledge, not knowing fear and reproach. <br><br>  Then the station passed through the packing shop.  Also ‚ÄúLuch‚Äù made metal products - masts, boxes, racks, traverses, etc. They also assembled the stations, tested and packed them. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7c3/485/8e7/7c34858e734a5ac22a2fda9e21162c9f.png"></div>  <i><font color="#999999">Installation of components on the station mounting frame</font></i> <br><br>  The plant took off a serious part of our concerns.  If we did everything ourselves, we would still implement this project.  We should also thank these wonderful people for getting rid of problems with the equipment and packaging equipment.  There was almost no mistake.  But then we heartily swallowed up with another warehouse in subsequent projects, for example, the task of sending equipment to a specific recipient with given serial numbers turned out to be practically unsolvable. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4ca/7f7/1b3/4ca7f71b31931e8a59b7aa4674e18b19.png"></div>  <i><font color="#999999"><a href="">A source</a></font></i> <i><font color="#999999"><br></font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">Typical behavior of warehouse staff</font></i> <br><br>  In order to meet the budget, the installation was entered into the project.  We visited 23 territorial offices (UGMS) of Roshydromet.  Local experts from the departments were gathered there, technical technicians were taught how to install and maintain the stations, and methodologists were told how to work with the new equipment and software.  The practice was fixed just chief-montage.  Further, these trained engineers of the departments independently installed the complexes and trained observers at the meteorological stations. <br><br>  We had up to 12 brigades under the installation supervision, each with 2 people. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/260/431/0b7/2604310b7ab77889c7d80f2b828404d6.png"></div>  <i><font color="#999999">Kursk, training.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">There was supposed to be a joke about heating, but I couldn't think of it</font></i> <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0095b6">Forget about grandma's methods</font> </h3><br>  Previously, an observer who (and usually - who) receives several thousand rubles a month should go to the site 8 times a day in any weather, climb a ladder, get thermometers, record readings, etc.  Now, at most Rosgidromet facilities, modern automated stations have replaced mercury barometers, hygrographs and other outdated meteorological tools. <br><br>  Manual observations in the end have not gone away (a classic example is the definition of the shape of clouds), but at individual points not belonging to the main observation network, the stations are transferred to a fully automatic mode. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2ae/82b/868/2ae82b86852d4be0825ab28fde1871ea.png"></div>  <i><font color="#999999">And this is a by-product - a mobile (collapsible) weather station.</font></i> <br><br>  There is a favorite bike from Soviet times, which we were told in Hydromet.  It describes well the relevance of our project. <br><br>  Students studied at some meteorological high school and conceived to go south.  Previously, everything was easier - they called to one of the southern weather stations: <br><br>  - We are students, we will arrive soon.  We will live here. <br>  - Yes, please come. <br>  They come - no one, only one little boy of 10-11 years old walks. <br>  Students ask: <br>  - Boy, where is everyone? <br>  - And they went to the next village for the wedding. <br>  It takes a couple of days, but no parents.  Go to the boy: <br>  ‚ÄúBoy, where are your parents?‚Äù <br>  - So they left for two weeks. <br>  - Well, but this is a weather station, every day you need to be on duty, in time to record everything and transmit. <br>  - Oh, nothing.  They all wrote two weeks in advance. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9bf/ef5/b2f/9bfef5b2f661bbecbf4f9d7bcd3b8a8b.png"></div>  <i><font color="#999999">Here it is, our hero.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">Logger</font></i> <br><br>  The most unique thing in our weather station is the software component.  I'm talking about scripts, or configuration.  Logger QML201 is very sophisticated.  So we did all sorts of unimaginable things that hardly anyone has since repeated.  Example: There is a key code for the transmission of meteorological information.  It's about <a href="http://method.meteorf.ru/norma/rec/code.pdf">KN-01</a> , which was invented in shaggy years and was confined exclusively to the telegraph.  The main data processing lay on the observer, and in our case it was necessary to considerably load the logger, instead of sending the primary data to the center and processing it already there. <br><br>  Despite our violent protests, we had to implement this miracle in the logger.  Yes, and with the distribution of data from the observer.  Less than 8 years, how we managed to <a href="http://www.lanit.ru/press/archive/index.php%3FELEMENT_ID%3D8920%26sphrase_id%3D11932">change something</a> . <br><br>  In addition to the weather stations, the project continued with 18 actinometric stations that measure all types of solar radiation. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/443/3d4/0b9/4433d40b91ae160b86673295851017b1.png"></div>  <i><font color="#999999">Actinometric station in Khabarovsk</font></i> <br><br>  And sea surface stations: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7e3/9f2/92a/7e39f292ad3dffad80f994be9aab1bd2.png"></div>  <i><font color="#999999">Sochi.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">Sea buoy measures a ton of weather and underwater parameters.</font></i> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a4c/788/ac6/a4c788ac6d586850b5ca43d74a1cfcd1.png"></div>  <i><font color="#999999">But without extras</font></i> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9b2/7f2/f2f/9b27f2f2fd24e2558f27e99429a574c2.png"></div>  <i><font color="#999999">ID tag</font></i> <br><br>  This sign, by the way, saved us all a lot of money.

By definition, roughly, a ‚Äúhard-to-reach station‚Äù is where you can‚Äôt get by car, don‚Äôt ride a horse.  And it is quite possible to get to Klukhor pass and live the life of the locals.
