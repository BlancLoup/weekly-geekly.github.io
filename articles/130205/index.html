  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to pay taxes on the sale of links on your site</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hi, Habr. <br><br>  Our accounting department almost every day receives questions from individual entrepreneurs on how to calculate taxes when working with links sale exchanges.  It was in the answers to these questions that the idea arose of integrating with the largest exchange of links selling and buying, in order to save webmasters from errors in tax returns. <br><br>  The most impatient can immediately, without reading further, set up automatic data exchange between Sape and My business and not worry about how to count taxes - My business does everything automatically.  In this case, all those who have configured the integration will receive a year of full access to the My Business service as a gift from Sape.  Configure the integration and get a year of access <a href="http://www.moedelo.org/SapeIp.aspx">here</a>

      But I still recommend that you familiarize yourself with the "materiel" in order to know where the amounts for tax payment come from every quarter. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, the key thing in calculating the taxes received from incomes in the system in SAPE is that the tax is calculated not from the amount of money withdrawn to the checking account from the SAPE system, but from the amount of operations indicated in the agent's report.  If the UE is located on the 'income-expenses' system, then in this case expenses are also included from the agent's report, which is transmitted by SAPE every month. <br>  This is a very important point, since many webmasters incorrectly calculate taxes based on the following logic: ‚ÄúI am 6%, so I will only reflect in the income the amount received on the account balance sheet‚Äù.  Unfortunately, in this case, as part of the first tax audit, the inspector will request an agreement with Softway LLC and will require additional taxes, penalties in the amount of 1/300 of the refinancing rate for each day of delay plus in some cases may incur an additional penalty. <br><br>  You can read more on the <a href="http://forum.sape.ru/showthread.php%3Ft%3D25235">Sapa forum</a> <br><br>  This calculates the amount of taxes that must be paid every quarter.  In addition to this most pleasant procedure, the law-abiding Individual entrepreneur, regardless of the type of activity, does the following: <br><ul><li>  Keeps a book of income and expenses - constantly on the <u>basis of the report of the agent</u> . </li><li>  Pays tax on the simplified tax system - 1 time per quarter.  See above how it counts. </li><li>  The fixed income is paid by the individual entrepreneur (insurance premium) - by December 31 of each year (this year it will be 16,159 rubles and 56 kopecks). </li><li>  It submits a declaration on the simplified taxation system - once a year. </li><li>  Provides information about the average number of employees - 1 time per year. </li><li>  Submits information to the Pension Fund (forms RSV-2 and SZV-6-1) - until March 1 of each year. </li></ul><br>  Absolutely all of the above <a href="http://www.moedelo.org/">My business</a> will do automatically based on the downloaded data from your SAPE account (of course, after you provide access), and all the generated reports will be sent to the controlling authorities via the Internet with one click.  I remind you that for webmasters who work with the Sape exchange, full access to the service for 1 year is <a href="http://www.moedelo.org/SapeIp.aspx">completely free</a> .  At the same time, we give unlimited access to accounting advice - our experts will answer any question about accounting within one working day.  That is, webmasters get not cut down promotional functionality, but the most complete access for 1 year, the same that all our paid users get. <br><br>  We will describe the benefits of working with the Sape link exchange as a PI as compared to an individual in the next post, since there is a suspicion that a large number of accounting terms have already put everyone to sleep. <br><br>  And for some reason I want to finish the article today like this: <br><br>  Internet users, IT specialists, Geeks, Businessmen and Freelancers, remember that reporting and taxes are all trifles, and the main thing is that thanks to you every day the world is made better, more modern and more convenient.  Something turns out, something is not so fast, but who really could imagine 5 years ago, you can do almost everything through the Internet: buy and legally watch any movie, get insurance or a credit card, find out the route of traffic jams and many more the most incredible things.  And all this is only thanks to the people who work in this industry. <br><br>  It is my deep conviction that it is the people of the Internet business who are moving the whole world forward and not allowing people with narrow-mindedness to dictate their rules. <br><br>  Successes!  Everything will work out! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/130205/">https://habr.com/ru/post/130205/</a></p>
