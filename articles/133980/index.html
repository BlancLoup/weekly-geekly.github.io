  <section class="page js-page"><h1>JSF GUI Development Experience</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> I have been developing browser GUIs for about 12 years already, among other things, I have experience using servlets, JSP, XML / XSLT, Struts, Tapestry (3,4,5), Wicket, Spring MVC and GWT. <br><br>  But JSF has bypassed the party so far.  The reason for this was that when JSF first appeared, it looked eerily clumsily in its first incarnations - compared to the same Tapestry and Wicket. <br><br>  Time passed, JSF was not going to die, but appeared already in version 2.1.  And I decided to try to use it for one of my experimental projects, for which I spend about 3 months every year - to broaden my horizons and distract from boring consulting (which I earn for children in the remaining 9 months).

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  On bare HTML forms, making GUI in the 21st century is, frankly, indecent.  Therefore, I wanted, of course, that there was AJAX and all sorts of such deliciously sexy widgets, which is called right out of the box. <br><br>  The following three candidates were selected as candidates for consideration based on the results of reading the Internet - <a href="http://www.jboss.org/richfaces">RichFaces</a> , <a href="http://www.primefaces.org/">PrimeFaces</a> and <a href="http://www.primefaces.org/">ICEFaces</a> .  The latest available (including beta, RC, etc.) versions of the frameworks were used. <br><br>  Sadly, the first two frameworks were cut off at the very first (thank Jaah! First), the dumbest test. <br><br>  What I had to build was a rich application backend.  Consequently, we can not do without tabs. <br>  Unfortunately, RichFaces and PrimeFaces do not understand that when rendering a set of tabs like: <br><br> <code>&lt;panelTabSet&gt; <br> <br> &lt;panelTab label="First tab"&gt; <br> ... <br> &lt;/panelTab&gt; <br> <br> &lt;panelTab label="Second tab"&gt; <br> ... <br> &lt;/panelTab&gt; <br> ... <br> <br> &lt;/panelTabSet&gt; <br></code> <br><br>  <u>it is not necessary to</u> rendit what is in ‚ÄúSecond tab‚Äù, if the selected tab is ‚ÄúFirst tab‚Äù.  RichFaces and PrimeFaces always create a tree of objects, including all the contents of the TabSet, i.e.  all non-selected tabs including.  It was absolutely unacceptable: there was a lot of data in each tab, including that which comes from the database. <br><br>  In addition to this regrettable inferiority, from RichFaces and PrimeFaces there and then leaked the need to use JavaScript, which I wanted to avoid. <br><br>  ICEFaces, surprisingly, not only was responsible for rendering tabs, but also contained components that simply worked, without any JavaScript. <br><br>  As a result, for approximately 120 hours of operation, it was possible to attach a fairly spreading GUI (12 large and complex forms) to the existing kernel, programming only in the form of a Facelets markup (in some places with CSS), and in Java, i.e.  without going into any javascript. <br><br>  This is how it all looks like: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/18dfd12c/d8f88f9c/8b6e7183/f652cee8.png"><br>  Skin is one of the defaults, called 'rime', so aesthetes might be unhappy. <br><br>  An important result: now I know what JSF can be used for (that is, not JSF at all, but specifically ICEFaces) - for backend interfaces that are not very heavily loaded (about hundreds of users), and with a slight distance between the browser and the server. <br><br>  Overhead to excessive communication with the server is compensated by the possibility of fast programming at a high level.  And, in general, everything works.  It even works server push (update screens on the event on the server). <br><br>  The following technologies were used: <br>  - Maven, well, where without him <br>  - ICEFaces, see above. <br>  - MyFaces instead of the standard Mojarra - due to better error diagnosis. <br>  - Spring Core <br>  - Spring Security <br>  - Selenium <br>  - Jetty <br><br>  I want to say a separate good word about JRebel - a tool for automated deployment of modified code without stopping VM.  I have their license for open-source development, but generally speaking JRebel is worth the modest money that comrades from Estonia ask for it.  Excellent product, works as stated and saves time. <br><br>  All development was carried out in IntelliJ IDEA.  But I suppose it should work the same way in Eclipse / Netbeans. <br><br>  Oh yeah, for what I started writing all this ... <br><br>  Actually, from my project, its essence was distilled and stored on the github in the form <br>  <a href="https://github.com/jacum/icefaces-archetype">this modest artifact</a> . <br>  It was going to make him Maven archetype, but it became lazy. <br><br>  In the project, everything stated above is present, and the base login / logout form works for which the Selenium test is also written.  Details in github README. <br><br>  I hope this helps someone to save some time at the start of an important project. <br>  It took me almost two weeks to select and match the components. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/133980/">https://habr.com/ru/post/133980/</a></p>
