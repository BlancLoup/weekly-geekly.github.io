  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Habrobydlo</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  About habr, bydle minuses and pros. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Until today, I did not write anything here, and I did not particularly comment, I read. <br>  But today somehow flooded.  Accordingly, up to this point, I had little contact with the local cattle.  But today I felt the beauty of this contingent. <br>  Since this was my first post, then at intervals of 10-15 minutes, I would press the reload button.  I, like any normal person, worry about the reaction my actions will cause.  Like anyone, I am very pleased when people praise me and not nice when they scold me.  And when criticized for no reason, it is very annoying. <br><br>  Habr seems to be conceived as a repository of useful info with a self-regulatory system. <br>  And everything is wonderful here.  It seems like a lot of adequate interesting people, a lot of information.  Who read Conan Doyle remembers how Watson was once surprised by Holmes' lack of knowledge of elementary concepts in astronomy.  On the fact that the earth revolves around the sun, Holmes logically remarked that this knowledge will not help in his deductive methods.  The attic is not endless, and if you put everything in there in a row, there will soon be no room for the right thing. <br>  Actually, I‚Äôm interested in Habra only about two percent of information, I don‚Äôt read everything else, I don‚Äôt understand it, I don‚Äôt understand it and I don‚Äôt want it.  But at the same time I do not care. <br>  I am pleased to put the pros.  I do not like to put minuses, if it is already completely inadequate, then of course.  I also do not like to observe how other people have nothing to do with which they put minuses.  And it especially annoys me when it happens in my blog.  If I write to it, then I think that it will be useful for at least one person, and if it is useful for at least one person, this is already a great achievement. <br>  So, in the process of constant monitoring of the level of karma and habrosils, I watched my habrasila periodically rise and then descend (even reach 5, that‚Äôs how!) Immediately after the appearance of my post on Habr√©, I already had a positive feedback and a good comment, and after a while, someone running past has already slapped the commentator with a minus and did not even comment on what) <br>  I did not like it, and I annulled this minus, then there were still pluses.  But in the late afternoon, the second part of the Marlezons ballet began. <br>  Began carpet bombing Minos, not only me, but also commentators.  But even if one comment for what?

      I have the impression that a certain type of habrowers stupidly walks around Habr and puts down cons about or for no reason.  Local cattle - Habrobydlo <br><br>  They do not think at all, that the writer is a person with emotions, desires, and not a stone robot who writes all sorts of nonsense.  What is written can be important for someone that there are other people besides them.  They mold the minuses, secretly gloating, enjoying the imaginary power over others.  Such people have problems with the map not in Habr√©, but in real life. <br><br>  In my opinion, the system of self-regulation contributes to this.  The problem is that it is anonymous.  And as you know shit is easier anonymously than when you look straight in the face. <br><br>  As for me, I need to be able to view a list of people who voted for you and how he did it.  Then half the cattle will withdraw.  Sykatno somehow, when they know for sure that you did it. <br><br>  Remembering the cat Leopold: "Let's live together."  If you are going to put a minus to someone, it is better to once again think what it would entail.  Not only for you, but also for the person to whom they put.  Do not forget that on the other side of the monitor the same person is also sitting. <br><br>  UPDATE <br>  another good idea <br>  <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/elanc/" class="user_link">elanc</a> offered to add voice commenting functionality to karma ... <br><br>  On the hackney theme already indicated.  I still could not restrain myself. <br><br>  PS <br>  Minus, especially karma.  If not difficult leave a comment why.  thank </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/45823/">https://habr.com/ru/post/45823/</a></p>
