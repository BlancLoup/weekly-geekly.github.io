  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Who are you in a startup: hipster, hustler, hacker or analyst</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  There is a theory that Earth rests on turtles, and startups on the ‚Äú3h‚Äù rule (it says that a startup should be based on hipster + hustler + hacker).  In general, the theory is clear, but it seems to us that something is missing in it.  Therefore, we want to talk about startups that are not held on turtles and whales, but on 4 key roles: hipster, hustler, hacker, and ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/be6/060/180/be6060180b56439cb6e1f098f254fad0.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  First, tell you what kind of theory ‚Äú3h‚Äù.  It says there are 3 fundamental roles in startups, three whales: a hacker is a developer or one who is responsible for all technical issues that arise when creating a product, a hipster is a designer who creates a beautiful wrapper and generally makes a product attractive, a hustler is one develops the product and promotes it (he also sells by and large and makes the product desirable by all). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/922/96c/09b/92296c09bb204ad3a5a041511333310d.png">

      But in order to make the product more valuable, we need someone who can competently evaluate all internal and external processes.  Who is buying?  What actions lead to the purchase?  What is beautiful for the client?  And what is convenient?  In general, we are convinced that in this whole picture of the world of startups there is not enough analyst, researcher, specialist who takes the big data into their strong hands and tells you how to increase conversion, do everything quickly, understand Central Asia and sell with one click. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/97f/37a/749/97f37a749d944ebba04049c3b05c38f6.png"><br><br>  Each of these characters has a specific set of skills.  <a href="https://go.open.ru/test%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_campaign%3Dhabr_open1">Take the test</a> and find out who you could have become in a modern startup: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/89a/76b/629/89a76b629d7344b0a95addd9da310e19.png"><br><br><h4>  #analyst </h4><br>  He must understand what the target audience wants = to understand the product promotion strategy.  He is needed, first of all, as a researcher of customer needs. <br><br>  The lack of competent analytics is a serious mistake of entrepreneurs and startups - they lock themselves on their vision of the product, on their ideas, while losing feedback from users and not correcting the product development strategy.  If the startup finds an analyst who can reject the idea and see the data behind a lot of letters, understand them and use them for the success of your product, the problems will be solved.  He can ask stupid questions to developers, demand an explanation from the marketer and swear at sales, because this is also a way of collecting data and information that can be critical for any project. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/742/dfa/3e6/742dfa3e67554d039b32aa70851a7479.png"><br><br><h4>  #hipster </h4><br>  Hipsters have a special attitude - they love the product with their eyes.  Own or a stranger, it is not so important.  And generally tendentious, but this is their main advantage. <br><br>  Hipsters like it when they see something special.  They know how to engage the audience.  And this is not only about design, but about the ‚Äúraisins‚Äù, which only a hipster can add, so that your audience likes and says: ‚ÄúThis is great, this is what I want to try!‚Äù.  It is this team member who will be able to create the right form for ideas, words and images that will be clearly associated with the brand and bring emotions to users.  Hipster understands that it is now in trend and that tomorrow will be interesting to the generation Z. He runs incredible advertising campaigns in social networks, which are then talked about and who uncontrollably like and repost. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cd3/ab1/fb2/cd3ab1fb27a84ba6bc68d9a5c9bf84ba.png"><br><br><h4>  #hacker </h4><br>  No tech startup can survive without a developer.  If the hipster can work on the soul of the product, then the hacker keeps the brain in order.  Otherwise, all other organs can simply be put on the stew.  The developer turns the code into a working service, into a product, into a tool that can solve real problems.  So the developer should take care of, motivate and <br>  control whether his product is consistent with yours. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ce8/2d2/c81/ce82d2c8192648dc8665882c333b9621.png"><br><br><h4>  # hustler </h4><br>  When an idea passes through a hacker and hipster, it is intercepted by a hustler.  The ‚Äúuncontrolled networking‚Äù mode is on, eyes are burning, business cards are distributed to everyone at the next very interesting meeting, sales are growing.  Hustler is not ready to put up with failures, he knows how and to whom to sell the product. <br><br>  The financial stability of your product also depends on it.  And if you find your hustler, then this is a big part of success.  Among the introverts in the team should be an extrovert? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/89c/d55/12a/89cd5512af9b428496a3d827a0af75c0.png"><br><br><h4>  Combo! </h4><br>  Here is the perfect combo for a startup: hacker, hipster, hustler and analyst.  Look for different people and find like-minded people, do not immediately recruit a team of people who will share the same tasks between them.  Immediately delegate, introduce some fashionable methods of work, so that everyone knows exactly what he needs to do. <br><br>  Avoid a hell of a headache and build a team with which you will be cool to work in the <a href="https://go.open.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_campaign%3Dhabr_open2">new internship of</a> one very cool bank. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/325804/">https://habr.com/ru/post/325804/</a></p>
