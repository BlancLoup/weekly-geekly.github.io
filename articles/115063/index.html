      In the next iteration, I think we will say goodbye to the theme of the ocean.  Octopus Original (oddball octopus), for example, would be a great name, but not this time.  Although, maybe, in 13 years! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/468/756/632/468756632dcd962a856298644916d756.jpg" alt="Ocelot" align="right">  My goal is to present the essence of all our work in the next six months with one simple title.  Of course, in the resulting result, there are inevitably Errors, Deviations (obliquity) or Opportunism of Originality (offbeat opportunism).  And, apparently, this next release will require something more than General orthodoxy - Skunkworks is now a trend.  Fortunately, I am absolutely sure that if Skunk is a descendant of Narwhal, then at least it will be a Sassy skunk! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, we are looking for a name that expresses mysterious possibilities, perhaps with the Mark of Obvious Orakulstva (ounce of overt oracular content).  Nothing pre-trial, overly trimmed or odious.  Something that symbolizes the clear, precise rhythm with which we, the community, are improving Ubuntu. <br><br>  There is a certain elegance in the fact that 11.10 will mark eight years from the day when Ubuntu was conceived (some time passed after birth).  Therefore, the Octilial (octennial) would fit well, but ... It would mean looking into the past, and we need to look into the future.  Hmm ... look into the future, maybe, Eyepiece?  We undoubtedly follow the s-shaped way (ogee) of borrowing, maybe this is what we need? <br><br>  There is another option to mark the visual language of Ubuntu Orange Okapi, or the hospitality of the Orangutan mediator community (osculant orangutan).  However, no one will accept you the way dholbach does ( <i>apparently, <a href="https://launchpad.net/~dholbach">Daniel Holbach</a> is referring to</i> ), and he is not a shaggy monkey at all. <br><br>  We need something figurative, something abstract, and at the same time not devoid of gloss and neatness.  Something that possesses all the precision of Eliot's poetry, combined with the "inexpressibility expressed in words" for all our values, relationships, and experience.  Something that reflects both the competence of ubuntu-devel and the imagination of ayatana. <br><br>  This naturally led us to the <b>Oniric Ocelot</b> (Oneiric Ocelot). <br><br>  Oniric means ‚Äúrelating to dreams,‚Äù which, in combination with Ocelot, reminds me of how innovations occur: partly due to visions, and partly to discipline. <br><br>  In the posterity of Natty, we need to preserve the speedy pace of innovation.  Our desktop has become beautiful, and with the next release we will finally make it available to all users, with OpenGL-based Unity - for those who have the right hardware.  And adding Qt support gives developers even more freedom to choose how to build an interface that is both functional and aesthetically flawless. <br><br>  In terms of cloud computing, we will need to tighten the requirements and make some tough decisions about the platforms supported in 12.04 LTS.  UDS in Budapest will undoubtedly take place in a heated debate on this topic, but they will also certainly come to a pragmatic consensus and allow us to focus on creating a platform for the ubiquitous spread of cloud computing on free and flexible conditions. <br><br>  Now Ubuntu is supplied annually on millions of systems by many suppliers.  Due to this, the lives of millions, and maybe tens of millions of people, change.  As MPT said, ‚Äúwhat we do is not just art, it‚Äôs a performance.‚Äù  Every six months the curtain rises, and we must be ready to speak.  I thank the thousands of people who are actively involved in the preparation of Natty: take the initiative, take responsibility, take action - your activity will improve the lives of all these users.  In this world it is not often the case that a personal intellectual contribution can have such an effect.  And rarely do such intellectual tasks gather such a strong community.  We do all this for ourselves, for reasons that are important to ourselves, but this is the global effect of Ubuntu, which fills this activity with meaning. <br><br>  Natty is a release of the transition period: we intend to completely change the interface of free systems.  We are going to take into account all the opinions that we can collect, so - please - test today's daily build or Alpha 3, send bug reports!  Keeping discipline, focusing on Narwhal, we will expect the coming of Ocelot. <br><br>  <i>After translating such texts, you really start to feel a little onyrychno ...</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/115063/">https://habr.com/ru/post/115063/</a></p>
