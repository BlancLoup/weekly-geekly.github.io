  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Virtualization today</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Before the crisis, when introducing virtualization, the companies aimed not only to reduce IT costs, but also to optimize and increase the flexibility of IT infrastructure.  Now, in unstable financial conditions, the main focus is on savings - the remaining parameters go into the background.  What can virtualization offer? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  There were three main areas: server virtualization, desktop virtualization, (desktop software maintenance and update) - and application virtualization, which reduces administration and software maintenance costs. <br>  In Russia, virtualization projects were promoted by system integrators in almost all industries, with attention paid to the flexibility and resiliency of the infrastructure.  At present, the situation has changed a little - the question arose: how to cut budgets while maintaining the same efficiency?  Roughly I say, on what, in the current conditions can you save? <br><br>  On the first plan came such savings, which are quite simple to measure: the number of switching equipment, reducing energy consumption ... <br>  If virtualization is not used, you can start with free server virtualization.  Such vendors as VMware, Citrix, Microsoft offer their products to resolve this issue. <br><br>  Free solutions based on VMwera ESXi, Citrix XenServer will help reduce IT costs by up to 40 percent, and not spend money on purchasing new servers in the near future.  This is a bit of help when you consider that IT budgets can be cut to a minimum.

      Instead of ordering a server, a more powerful one is purchased, capable of performing much more tasks.  In many cases, it is enough to increase the amount of RAM, since most of the tasks are not demanding on the processor resurases.  It is also preferable to use shared storage for virtual machines. <br>  If the company has a large infrastructure and there are funds for IT optimization, commercial virtualization solutions may be an option. <br>  In the near future, proposals are expected from vendors for virtualizing a small IT infrastructure.  For example, VMware has Acceleration Kits, allowing you to deploy 2-4 physical servers at a discount on products. <br><br>  In the absence of funds for a full-scale virtualization project, you should think about hiring consultants "by the hour."  It is not so difficult - the main thing is the right approach.  Counseling can also help with employee training. <br><br>  If previously a sysadmin managed 10 physical servers, then using virtualization, he will be able to serve up to 50 virtual servers with the same ratio for physical servers.  This leads to the automation of the computing environment and is provided by commercial software, but people are always more expensive than software products. <br>  For companies that have already implemented virtualization technologies, in difficult times of crisis, there is a direction in which to reduce costs.  The goal is to get a resource-balanced, fault-tolerant data center with minimal costs.  To do this, you need to increase user productivity (testing, Lab Manager products), reduce administration costs (virtual machine life cycle). <br><br>  It is time to revise the ‚Äúone task - one server‚Äù approach.  Virtualization can be started today - in order to get a concrete advantage tomorrow and survive in difficult conditions.  Free virtualization software, products for centralized management of infrastructure, the use of which will reduce the cost of maintaining a fleet of servers, computers and applications, will help you. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/61780/">https://habr.com/ru/post/61780/</a></p>
