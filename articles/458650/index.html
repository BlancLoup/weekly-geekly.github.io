  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Cybercall. New level. Online competition from Rostelecom-Solar</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The confrontation of the sword and shield is an eternal thing.  For every armor excellent for its time in a couple of years (or decades) there will definitely be a sword that will crush such armor rather cheerfully.  The guys from the defense industry, spell-crushed by the presence of such a sword, will create a new armor, which will be a good defense.  Until again come up with a new sword.  In general, this is the question of what would be good to maintain the current state of protection. <br><br>  Cybersecurity is similar.  Ten-year-old viruses no longer frighten anyone, even people far from information technologies, because the basic OS protection system copes with them.  But with modern cryptographers, for example, things are no longer so simple.  You can overlap with all sorts of paid antiviruses, but if you do not observe sound network hygiene and sometimes run the administrator ‚Äúpictures‚Äù with the extension .exe, the result will be sad.  But predictable. <br><br> <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/rostelecom/blog/458650/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ym/o2/0u/ymo20ua1tlg-lnbhgcgzjetcszg.jpeg" width="900"></a>

      The more common the Internet becomes, the greater the number of information threats.  And it's not even about increasing the number of ‚Äúmother hackers‚Äù, who need your mother's maiden name for hacking mail, but also that the ways of hacking with the help of new technologies and tools are becoming more and more. <br><br>  Fortunately, the number of those who want to act on the ‚Äúwhite‚Äù side, that is, defense, is also growing.  Schoolchildren and students are actively interested in technology and are studying countering threats. <br><br>  We in Rostelecom decided to build for these guys the system ‚ÄúSchool - university ‚Äî employer‚Äù.  And now we will talk about how our new educational program for students will be held. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  What will it be </h2><br>  We are holding an online competition ‚ÄúCyber ‚Äã‚ÄãChallenges.  New level ‚Äùfor those who are interested in information security and who would like to try their hand at business.  Tasks will be both theoretical and practical.  We will analyze live cases about the protection of corporate environments and banking infrastructure. <br><br>  The key topic of the competition will be the industrial control system (automated process control system).  After all, if the attacker gets access to it (in any industry), it will be difficult to overestimate the potential harm.  Therefore, the tasks will be associated with its protection. <br><br>  In addition, we will also address these areas: <br><br><ul><li>  cryptography; </li><li>  fornica; </li><li>  incident investigation (including low-level); </li><li>  web security; </li><li>  search and exploit binary vulnerabilities; </li><li>  reverse engineering. </li></ul><br>  These are the tasks to be solved by those who decide to participate in the competition. <br><br><h2>  Why participate at all and how will the selection take place </h2><br>  Cyber ‚Äã‚ÄãCalls - entrance ticket to our educational program and internship at the <a href="https://rt-solar.ru/products/jsoc/">Solar JSOC</a> monitoring center.  We will offer participants to solve puzzles on the topics described above.  Scoring will be automatic - the more people solve a specific task, there will be less points for it.  For example, if the problem is solved in general, it will bring everyone a lot less points than the task that was solved by two people.  These two will get more points for such a task. <br><br>  The rating of participants will be available in real time throughout the entire digital match. Then we will select 60 people who have scored the most points, and arrange for them to be interviewed via Skype, after which 40 finalists will be determined.  They will first go to Sirius for an informational education program, and then the best will go to our monitoring center for an internship, during which you can both get good material for your coursework and diplomas, and think about employment. <br><br><h2>  Important dates and numbers </h2><br><ul><li>  Till July 19 inclusive: it is necessary to <a href="https://cyberchallenge.rt.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dmassmedia%26utm_medium%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_campaign%3Dolympiada_cyber">register on the website of "Kibervyzov"</a> . </li><li>  July 20‚Äì21: online stage of the competition. </li><li>  July 22‚Äì24: interview with the finalists of the first stage. </li><li>  September 8-22: educational program in <a href="https://sochisirius.ru/">Sirius</a> . </li><li>  18‚Äì22: age limits for participants. </li><li>  0 rubles: the amount that the finalists will spend on travel and accommodation during the educational program. </li></ul><br><h2>  Those who missed </h2><br>  Of course, there will be those who are wildly interested in the subject itself and would like to go to work in these areas, but did not manage to get to the competition or become its finalist.  This is not scary, because we will post video courses on our resources in order to organize distance learning properly. <br><br>  In general, it will not be boring. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/458650/">https://habr.com/ru/post/458650/</a></p>
