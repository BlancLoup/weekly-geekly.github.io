To her credit, it must be said that this is really a leader in her business, who has achieved serious success.  It is worth noting a beautiful cozy office, completely sane HR (which was very nice), a lot of bonuses (insurance, simulators, training ...) for employees. <br><br>  Everything was very nice.  And to all really thank you very much. <br><br>  But I would like to say something that really struck me!

    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  They wanted to see me as a perlovik.  And they asked me these questions: <br><br><pre>  my $ x = 1;
 $ x = $ x ++ + ++ $ x; </pre><br><pre>  print (print "A", print "B", print "C"); </pre><br><pre>  my $ x = 0;
 (1)? $ X = 1: $ x = 2;
 print $ x; </pre><br>  The fact that I did not approach them as a perlovik, I somehow had no doubts :-) But going home in the night city, I thought about something else. <br><br><h2>  What did these people want to know? </h2><br>  They did not ask me about my OO beliefs. <br><br>  They did not ask about the elements of functional programming (map vs. for; that when is better). <br><br>  They did not ask about regular expressions. <br><br>  They did not ask about the algorithms (at least the classical optimization of the built-in sorting from Rendal-Schwartz). <br><br>  They did not ask how I feel about goto; <br><br>  What, in my opinion, should be comments and documentation; <br><br>  Is it good to copy the code? <br><br>  Do I have any idea about template engines and so on. <br><br>  Do I have any ideas about paters (iterators, adapters ...). <br><br>  What do I know about lazy calculations. <br><br>  All these things may or may not be known;  use fanatically or use moderate ... there is something to talk about ... But instead, you yourself-see-what was asked;  and from here I have another question. <br><br><h2>  What is the code for these people?  What will I see when I come to a new job? </h2><br>  I do not know these people, but I know how much success their company has achieved, and this does not allow me to think about them badly ... however ... I had a firm confidence that I would come to a heap of spaghetti code. <br><br>  I have seen such a mountain code.  Where the only comment was "PREDED!".  Instead of: <br><br><pre>  $ q = 0;
 $ q ++; </pre><br>  great programmers wrote <br><br><pre>  $ {q = q =} - = $ {qq-};  # PYST! PYST !!! 111
 $ {q + q +} ++ # KILL ME! 11111 </pre><br>  Just because it's fun. <br><br>  And breathing in the cool of the night, I thought, <br><br><h2>  Perhaps language dictates how to express yourself. </h2><br>  Perl programmers have this way of expressing themselves.  They do not really think about what I have listed as important questions for me ... <br><br>  And I decided to write the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/crazydev/63944/">following article</a> (which I will publish a little earlier this one, so that they go in the correct order from top to bottom :-) <b>upd: I</b> published it correctly, but it‚Äôs still not in the order I expected :-)). <br><br>  <b>upd2:</b> I want to assure everyone again, I don‚Äôt want to discredit anyone with this topic!  In the end, people could be tired, something to lose sight of (it was a late evening).  Could and guess something in my words.  I first told about myself, maybe some questions from them immediately disappeared ... the fact that I was not asked about something was not very surprising.  It amazes <i>me what I was asked about</i> :-) I don‚Äôt understand why they did it and what they wanted to find out in this way.  That's all. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/63945/">https://habr.com/ru/post/63945/</a></p>
