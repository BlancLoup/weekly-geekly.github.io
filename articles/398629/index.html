    <blockquote>  ‚ÄúOur new hoster asked to somehow settle the relationship with Roskomnadzor (RKN).  At that moment, it turned out that a significant number of Roskomnadzor‚Äôs locks, written out to Lurk, are completely meaningless: some files have been deleted, some articles have been renamed, but all these URLs appear in the registry.  61 pieces.  At the same time, on our server some of the articles are not given to Russia, but providers are instructed to block these articles.  And until mid-August, they were ordered to block Lurk entirely, because of an Adygea article, on the basis of such a letter: <a href="http://pastebin.com/NctdBdvL">pastebin.com/NctdBdvL</a> .  That is, some articles were blocked 3 times for the Russian Federation: us, Roskomnadzor at the URL and Roskomnadzor together with all Lurk. <br><br>  Out of pure interest, I entered the missing URLs into the nginx configs, because I was tired of butting with the RKN in this place. </blockquote><br>  "Lurkmorie" - an alternative Russian-language Internet encyclopedia.  Filled on the principle of "Wikipedia", "Lurkmorie" has its own specifics and culture, introduced there from the Russian and foreign imageboard.  However, this does not prevent the authors of articles from covering fairly extensive and serious topics, for example, GTR and SRT, but with the use of internal vocabulary and design features. <br><br>  Problems "Lurkmorie" with Roskomnadzor began back in 2012 because of the article about marijuana.  At the request of the Federal Drug Control Service, the IP address of Lurka was blocked and included in the list of prohibited sites.  Then the situation was resolved by restricting access to the controversial article. <br><br>  In 2013, "Lurk" has already hit the list of extremist sites and was again blocked for an article about Adygea.  And again, the content had to be removed at the request of the state, and a text stub referring to ‚Äú451 Fahrenheit‚Äù was posted on the corresponding link: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/98d/cfe/11e/98dcfe11e0d25249cd04d7cf65a18315.png"><br><br>  In 2014, Lurka was asked to remove articles about Ramzan Kadyrov and the Molotov cocktail, also recognizing them as extremist. <br><br>  In 2015, Lurkmore was hit by a complete blockage due to the transition to the HTTPS protocol.  Now the site works via HTTP, which supports the ability to block individual pages. <br><br>  In total, according to Roskomsvoboda, lurkmore.to was mentioned 212 times in the Roskomnadzor banned sites registry based on decisions of various departments and courts.  Thus, ‚ÄúLurk‚Äù can be called the most long-suffering resource of the RuNet in the entire history of locks held by the authorities and the RKN. <br><br>  Not the fact that the decision of the founder of the resource will allow to avoid attention to the encyclopedia in the future.  "Lurkmorie" has its own culture of presentation of the material, which, often, is not distinguished by correctness and restraint, so it is likely that questions to the encyclopedia from the authorities may still arise. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/398629/">https://habr.com/ru/post/398629/</a></p>
