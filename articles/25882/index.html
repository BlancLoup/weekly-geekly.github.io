They could not believe it if it were not for the <a href="http://www.fontanka.ru/2008/05/21/044/">environmentalists</a> who would not hush up exactly such things. <br><br>  <strong>How it's done:</strong>

      - There must be at least some <a href="http://www.mr-spb.ru/news/news_5439.html">basis</a> for seeding a panic, then there will be little trust in official sources <br><br>  - Information concerns absolutely everyone and everyone, you need to make everyone empathize, worry about their friends and relatives and thus make everyone a potential peddler of the virus <br><br>  - The informational virus should touch the historical memory, since the times of Chernobyl any negative, even if unchecked information about the NPP is perceived painfully.  By the way, about a year ago, a rumor went through Russia about salt price hike - what if not the historical memory played? <br><br>  - High speed and large coverage of information dissemination.  Although some media claim that this was the work of a telephone terrorist, but most likely he was not alone - how many hands and vocal cords should one have to cope with so many sms and phone calls? <br><br>  - Manufacturability - if Shiva still had one multi-armed and many-sided one, it means that he had special software, including for spamming forums and LiveJournal and sending press releases, which means that the base of the media and mobile operators <br><br>  - Connection to participation in the campaign of officials - in kindergartens and schools there were calls from medical institutions or allegedly from medical institutions with instructions to give children iodine and not to go outside <br><br>  <strong>Why this is done:</strong> <br><br>  - It is possible, as with salt, to test how easy it is to create hysteria in society <br><br>  - Someone doesn‚Äôt give rest to the laurels of Zenit and the hockey team, so we should rather create a powerful information channel that would interrupt these two events <br><br>  - Oppositional-minded citizens are trying to reinforce the opinion of the deceitfulness of the authorities (they still blame the authorities for anybody, not the NPP workers), sow doubt in the grain of uncertainty and make the indifferent think <br><br>  - This is really one telephone terrorist, who was passing nearby, saw some kind of smoke from the chimney and let everyone frighten <br><br>  - Raise sales of iodine :) <br><br>  <strong>What did not work:</strong> <br><br>  - Though our mass media are scolding - most of them tried to check the information before publication. <br><br>  Something like that. <br><br>  PS In St. Petersburg pharmacies snapping up iodine <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/25882/">https://habr.com/ru/post/25882/</a></p>
