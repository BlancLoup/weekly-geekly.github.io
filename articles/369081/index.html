      Despite all the efforts of zoodefenders, we do not care much about animals.  It is still much easier for many to buy a new puppy in the bird market than an expensive GPS tracker (especially by the standards of the provinces).  Of course, we are not talking about purebred dogs, for example, hunting.  Their owners easily buy devices for their pets and do not consider these expenses silly.  However, enough of ethical reasoning, back to the technical points.  By tradition, we consider several interesting foreign services and compare them with ours. <br><br><h2>  <a href="http://www.pettracker.com/">Whistle, United States</a> </h2><br>  The company specializes exclusively in trackers for animals.  The love for them is so great that even on the ‚ÄúAbout Us‚Äù page, employees are photographed with cats and dogs, and the staff officially includes shaggy and tailed testers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/81e/6b3/b1f/81e6b3b1f128490ab431bbd23b7b12dd.png"><br><br>  Whistle allows you to monitor not only the movements of the pet, but also its health - there is a special device for this.  The weight of the trackers is from 15 g to 35 g, they are waterproof, and the SIM card is already built into the device.  Cost - from $ 79.95 to $ 99.95, depending on the model.  Observation is carried out through smartphones, while the whole family can connect to the service.  Service works only in the United States of America.  The first month is free, then you have to pay from $ 6.95 to $ 9.95, depending on the functionality. <br><br><h2>  <a href="https://tractive.com/en">Tractive, Austria</a> </h2><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bc8/86c/b6a/bc886cb6a7ea42dc9e13f088d091cfff.jpg"><br><br>  Like the Americans, in the European line there are devices that monitor the location and physical activity of the animal.  In addition, there is a special tracker that helps train and control the dog, thanks to the soft vibration.  The size of the trackers - from 10 to 35 grams.  They are all waterproof, and the duration of work without recharging - from a week to a year, depending on the model.  The cost of the tracker is from 25 to 99 euros, the cost of the service starts from 3.75 euros per month. <br><br><h2>  <a href="http://www.loc8tor.com/">Loc8tor, United Kingdom</a> </h2><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d3c/b74/485/d3cb7448514743a88d04776104fe6bdf.jpg"><br><br>  This service offers products for all categories of users (children, employees, cars, animals) and this is similar to <a href="http://www.gdemoi.ru/">Where is My</a> .  The tracker for dogs weighs about 60 grams, is protected from moisture, shock and scratches and works from the SIM-card.  There is a set that includes a tracker, a case and a beautiful box, $ 166 for a sale.  In addition, recently "Locator" introduced a special device for cats.  It operates on the basis of radio tags, not by GPS, the range is limited to 122 meters, but the tracker emits light and sound signals - in case the cat likes to hide. <br><br>  The range of services includes not only animal trackers, but also video cameras ‚Äî to keep track of pets while they are hosted in an apartment during a person‚Äôs absence. <br><br><br><h2>  <a href="http://www.podtrackers.com/">Pod trackers</a> </h2><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/43f/9a6/43f/43f9a643f9994950896f9d73c4aa132e.jpg"><br><br>  The service operates in more than 175 countries, including Russia (although here, given its price, it is unlikely to become popular).  The device, in principle, is similar to everything described earlier: miniature, waterproof, lightweight.  Easily attached to the collar and works without recharging for about a week.  The device of the second generation is able to find animals not only in nature, but also indoors, as it works on the basis of WiFi.  The cost of the device: $ 199, the cost of service - $ 49 annually, starting with the second year of work. <br><br><h2>  <a href="http://www.gdemoi.ru/gps-monitoring/assets/pet">Where is My, Russia</a> </h2><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/358/77f/87b/35877f87bc4440a3a6e4cf747df91173.png"><br><br>  As we said at the beginning of the article, among Russian buyers, livestock breeders are found almost as often as zools.  Therefore, in our assortment there are solutions for both small animals (mostly dogs - for standard-sized cats, GPS trackers are still too big) and <a href="http://www.gdemoi.ru/gps-monitoring/assets/pet/">GPS trackers for cattle</a> . <br><br>  For dogs of small breeds, X-Pet1 is suitable - our most "glamorous" model, perhaps.  It weighs only 35 grams, is mounted on a collar, has two search modes - by GPS and by LBS (cell phone towers).  Owners of large or overly active breeds use the <a href="https://www.gdemoi.ru/gps-monitoring/assets/pet/">X-Pet 2</a> model: lightweight (60 g), anti-vandal (stable even in front of itchy puppy fangs), reliable.  The charge lasts for 5-7 days, provided that the interval mode.  Cost - 8900 rubles, or about $ 130. <br><br>  The cost of the service itself is no different from other monoish products (Employees, Transport, Cargo) - the tariff plans start from 0 rubles per month.  For pets it will be optimal. <br><br><h2>  And for those who do not like to read large texts, we have summarized all the important information in the table: </h2><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a6c/cff/897/a6ccff897c7f4d57bfcf2a82f2b1a9bc.png"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/369081/">https://habr.com/ru/post/369081/</a></p>
