  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Everything about Chrome OS on OsByGoogle.com</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d8a/ea3/52b/d8aea352b50d683a4a0b1265f594b566.jpg">  Hi, Habrahabr.  Today I decided to write a new post on the ‚ÄúI am PR‚Äù blog and tell about how with the help of Habrahabr I found a good friend and author for my site about the Google Chrome OS operating system, as well as about our attempt to monetize the project. <br><br>  About a year and a half ago, I realized that for my small site, more like a traditional blog, more people (and not just me) are needed to write interesting materials, then I decided to write Habr in ‚ÄúI am promoting‚Äù about search co-author.  Of course, Habr was not exactly the right place, because, in my opinion, people are already hanging out with ready-made projects, and few people are interested in joining other teams. <br><br>  And so I wrote a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/i_am_advertising/82365/">topic</a> .  At that time, my site was visited by incomprehensible 15 people per day (they were incomprehensible because I did not advertise and was not on search on page 1), after writing the topic the bar jumped to 2000, and then slowly dropped to 50. It was undoubtedly cool The site on which there were 20 pieces of materials (at the very beginning of the project) was visited by many people, and many more responded to the proposal to become co-authors.  Some were very quick and offered to reshape the design, override the site, switch to popular CMS and abandon the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãusing their own code. <a name="habracut"></a>

        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      In the end, I spoke with a bunch of people ready to start writing articles on the site.  But few from whom I waited for the finished materials.  People mostly fed breakfast, someone published rough translations of web translators on the similarity of promt.ru.  But I got a good man.  The guy from Moscow ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/cherezzabo/" class="user_link">cherezzabo</a> ), who immediately in the first letter of the application, sent me a list of typos and errors found on the entire site.  Word for word, so we started working together.  To date, he has written <a href="http://www.osbygoogle.ru/alluser/">almost 500 articles</a> and news reports for the site. <br><br>  We even worked quietly at GTUG meetings at Google‚Äôs office, where we presented our info-site about Chrome OS. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9dd/139/ccd/9dd139ccdea74ec19ce3545a78f38bbe.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Once I even visited Daniil in Moscow (I myself was living in Petersburg at that moment), that day we visited <a href="http://osbygoogle.ru/article.php%3Fid%3D268">Google Developer Day</a> at the invitation of GTUG. <br><br>  But that day always comes when you understand that it is necessary to expand, and today we are promoting a new service from our site.  <a href="http://osbygoogle.ru/rent/">Chromebook laptop rental</a> for residents of Moscow.  For all those who have had an interesting Chrome OS for these long two years since the announcement in July 2009, it is now possible to rent a branded Samsung Series 5 Chromebook Wi-Fi + 3G for 30 days, which is not yet sold in Russia.  And you can do it for only 3000 rubles.  The price, of course, is not quite small, but it is several times less than similar services in this market. <br><br>  If you would like to try a cloud device from Google and see if you need such a device now, then this is a great and convenient way to check it.  One month of use allows you to add a full impression of your Chromebook.  You risk nothing, but you can join the ‚Äútechnology of the future‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e42/d8d/60b/e42d8d60bb74bdb7ef8b9c13c1a70cb4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  By the way, the launch of this service is carried out right at the time of publication of this post, so this attempt to monetize the project will be successful or not, we will understand only with you.  =) <br><br>  Read <a href="http://osbygoogle.ru/">all about Chrome OS on OsByGoogle.com</a> <br><br>  UPD: Dear friends, thoughtlessly minus - stupid, unsubscribe in the comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/126839/">https://habr.com/ru/post/126839/</a></p>
