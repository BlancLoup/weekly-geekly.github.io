  <section class="page js-page"><h1>About how Harry Potter forms Russian education, naturally not where it should be</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p>  I personally drowned for design education since 2013.  I even wrote <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/207466/">an article</a> in which I described how to raise the center of youth innovation creativity from the ground up (Center for Youth Innovative Creativity), and I ran the Cosmoport Laboratory in Yekaterinburg for 4 years.  I participated in the creation of three children's technical creativity laboratories, and advised the organizers of such laboratories.  I also took part in the transition of UrFU to a project approach, conducted a couple of project workshops and developed an IRS (Project Rating System) for students.  I spent a lot of engineering competitions, forums, sessions, tournaments.  And all this is no good.  Now I realized that design education is a time bomb. </p><br><p>  In this article I will tell you what is dangerous about the project approach, which is the essence of the same as the exam.  How are Harry Potter and project education.  In the end I will share the option of getting out of the inconspicuous trap. <a name="habracut"></a></p><br><h2 id="proektnoe-myshlenie">  Project thinking </h2><br><p>  Project education gives rise to project thinking in humans.  Project thinking is that a person can embed his project into reality or respond to his own challenges with reality with his project.  A project always has an internal part and interfaces of interaction with the outside world, there are inputs and outputs.  The project is built into the external system, while having its own internal system.  A person goes through the system of project education and at the exit has a structure of thinking that can find problems in reality and respond to them with a new product or solution. </p><br><p>  All this is good, but, unfortunately, this makes a person uncompetitive in the modern world, no matter how sad it is.  And that's why.  The fact is that now the reality is very diverse, there is no longer the general line of the party, but there are many different realities that are constantly changing and replacing each other.  If a person has been trained in a project approach, he will constantly look for options to integrate into some kind of reality and make a project in it, he will make this project, but reality will change, the project will be useless, he will be integrated into the new project, and so on to infinity.  Most projects become obsolete while they are being made.  And of course the money.  In this approach, you will not earn much.  Just the usual salary of a project manager or an innovative entrepreneur. </p><br><p>  In the modern world, project thinking is a pledge that its owner will be begging for the realities that real players make.  And such thinking is considered the best in Russia, and in the world too.  This is considered an elite entity.  The project approach has already been implemented in the best universities, and in the worst is being implemented. </p><br><h2 id="hogvarts">  Hogwarts </h2><br><p>  Design education is based on the Hogwarts model.  No wonder Potter films were filmed in the real building of Oxford.  The main thing in project education is the application of knowledge in practice.  For students, the way out to real life is formed, they are given the opportunity to solve real problems, for example, to fulfill orders, or to solve problems of industries, to delve into the essence of processes and propose system solutions for industries.  In Harry Potter, friends had to solve problems and apply magic at once to fight dark forces.  With this approach, knowledge is absorbed well, in addition, there is a motivation to extract them independently.  And there is always an ethical component, public support. </p><br><p>  Harry Potter gives us the ideal model of project education, because the strongest instinct is active in it - the instinct of power (domination), friends are constantly in the fight against evil forces, and this stimulates the maximum digestibility of knowledge.  The best design models of education are also based on the struggle - it is always a competition, there is always a struggle and the definition of winners.  These are makertones, tournaments, contests, ratings and more. </p><br><p>  Now there is a generation in life that has grown up on books and films about Potter, I have repeatedly heard from colleagues that they are building their educational system according to the Hogwarts model, as well as ‚Äúlearning life‚Äù in 7 books you know about whom. </p><br><p>  This is a good model, but it makes a person "disabled" in terms of thinking.  If you have learned such thinking, then you feel like an ‚Äúelite‚Äù, you really can do a lot, but this is simply not what you need. </p><br><h2 id="proektnoe-obrazovanie--eto-rasshirennyy-ege">  Project education is an expanded exam </h2><br><p>  The test system of the Unified State Exam is essentially a system of rigidly fitting a person into a certain reality.  This reality is set by rigid frameworks, which are described in the test.  Passed the exam - learned reality.  Design education is the same, only a person is invited to independently determine what reality he fits in, identify patterns, give himself a brief, then work out an answer to it in the form of a project.  It turns out, design education - the same exam, only a complicated version.  The schools have already launched a new GEF, which regulates the project activities of schoolchildren. </p><br><p>  We have a classic manipulation when it is proposed to choose from two bad options.  A person can choose - either subject education or project education, but both of them doom a person to life in someone else‚Äôs created reality.  And for success you need to be able to design your own realities. </p><br><h2 id="igrovoe-myshlenie">  Game thinking </h2><br><p>  We now have no education that would teach a person to create his own reality, to make his own game.  We now have no systems that would allow a person not to be built in, but to make his own game, to be a creator.  For this person, it is necessary to teach how the consciousness and the unconscious work, his ‚Äúanimal‚Äù instinctive sphere and ‚Äúhuman‚Äù cultural part of it, how a person thinks, how he makes decisions, which classical unconscious programs work on his mind, and which constructs he recently implanted.  It is necessary to study the questions: "How can a person turn on the game? How can we take a person out of the game, what triggers are there in the unconscious?"  - All this is the prospect of creating a new educational system.  And, of course, in order to foster gaming in a person, it is necessary to give him high-quality tools of self-knowledge and personal growth, which in Russia is considered a move by the official educational environment.  But ask any successful person who has risen on his own feet - and he will answer that the main reason for his success is that he ‚Äúworked on himself‚Äù. </p><br><p>  We are developing a new educational system to foster gaming thinking, but when will it reach the masses?  Maybe never. </p><br><p>  In conclusion, I‚Äôll just give some literature on creating my own game realities, only a small part has been translated into Russian. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/eb/c3/6k/ebc36k1o2u3s1azdijjgmi3rmhc.png" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kw/t3/sk/kwt3skhhxxdraariie_jop35q-o.png" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pd/dj/x0/pddjx0e0wsvtbvtyvrbumlpmvgw.png" alt="image"></p></div>
