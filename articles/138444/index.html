Every detail was revised, including the logo of the new OS, which now reflects the spirit of modernity.  Despite the fact that the windows logo has already become a very widespread and recognizable brand, after analyzing it, we realized that the further development of our logo can help us better reflect the principles of Metro design. <br><br>  We had a very small list of organizations with which we would like to cooperate in logo design, and we were very pleased when Pentagram agreed to help us with this.  The works of Pentagram speak for themselves, but most of all we were attracted by their vision of classical graphic design, which fit our Metro concept so well. <br><br>  At the beginning of the development of Windows 8, in the conference room on our campus, our designers and marketing directors arranged a meeting with the guys from Pentagram.  From morning to evening, we exchanged ideas and discussed the principles of Metro-style and the history of our logo. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  A window, not a flag. </h2>  Paula (from Pentagram) asked us one simple question: ‚ÄúYour operating system is called Windows, why then is there a flag on your logo?‚Äù

      In a sense, you can tell a parallel between the evolution of the Windows logo and the evolution of the technologies used to create logos.  Starting with a simple two-color version in Windows 1.0, and ending with a sophisticated detailed logo in Windows Vista and Windows 7, each change reflected the spirit of its time.  As computing power increased, we began to use this potential to use more colors, draw better fonts, and use more detailed effects like shadows, depth, etc., which gave our logos a sense of materiality.  We have come a long way from the world of archaic low-resolution graphics to today's beautiful HD systems.  And the fact that it was once a simple picture of the window (and underlined the name of our brand) today has become a bright flying flag. <br><br>  If you look at the first version of the logo, then you will see that there actually was a window.  ‚ÄúWindows‚Äù (windows) is a rather successful metaphor, and in the new logo we wanted to emphasize this idea once again.  In essence, the idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãMicrosoft and Windows is to give people technology so that they can reach their potential.  And this is exactly what a new logo represents.  To a large extent, we did not even redesign, but a return to the original representation of the ‚ÄúWindows‚Äù logo - to the window. <br> <a href=""><img src="http://windowsteamblog.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/CommunityServer-Blogs-Components-WeblogFiles/00-00-00-59-23-metablogapi/5315.winlogo_2D00_history3_5F00_thumb_5F00_20CF425A.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  Let's look at some versions of logos: <br><br><h3>  <b>Windows 1.0</b> </h3>  Few people remember the original Windows logo, but we found it quite fresh and inspiring in the context of our work on the Metro style.  Using simple lines and clear, clear ideas, this logo reminded us of what a wonderful name we gave to our system - ‚ÄúWindows‚Äù. <br> <a href=""><img src="http://windowsteamblog.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/CommunityServer-Blogs-Components-WeblogFiles/00-00-00-59-23-metablogapi/6318.2_5F00_thumb_5F00_0B0559FD.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br><h3>  <b>Windows 3.1</b> </h3>  For many of us, the history of Windows begins with this logo.  The classic shape and 4 corporate colors have long been the hallmark of Windows.  The waving flag gave the logo a sense of movement.  This logo was the basis of all versions of Windows during the 90s. <br> <a href=""><img src="http://windowsteamblog.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/CommunityServer-Blogs-Components-WeblogFiles/00-00-00-59-23-metablogapi/4377.3_5F00_thumb_5F00_51161710.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br><h3>  <b>Windows xp</b> </h3>  The following significant change was made to the logo during the release of Windows XP.  "Flag" has become more simple and sophisticated, in comparison with previous versions.  The ‚ÄúStart‚Äù button in the lower left corner of the screen also acquired a more ‚Äúmaterial‚Äù look, thanks to the use of gradients, shadows and 3D effects. <br> <a href=""><img src="http://windowsteamblog.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/CommunityServer-Blogs-Components-WeblogFiles/00-00-00-59-23-metablogapi/5775.4_5F00_thumb_5F00_6939816B.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br><h3>  <b>Windows vista</b> </h3>  The release of Windows Vista marked the beginning of the use of the ‚ÄúAERO‚Äù design, a key component of which was the ‚ÄúAERO glass‚Äù effect (the very muddy glass in Windows Vista and Windows 7).  The round and flatter version of the flag came to replace the green ‚ÄúStart‚Äù button.  This icon is also known as ‚Äúpearl‚Äù (pearl).  You can see complex lighting effects, the icon as if covered with a fictional layer of glass.  In many ways, this showed how powerful graphics systems became during this time.  The same version of the logo is almost unchanged migrated to Windows 7. <br> <a href=""><img src="http://windowsteamblog.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/CommunityServer-Blogs-Components-WeblogFiles/00-00-00-59-23-metablogapi/1018.5_5F00_thumb_5F00_080FF54A.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br><h3>  <b>Windows 8</b> </h3>  We approached the logo redesign in Windows 8 based on several key principles: <br><ol><li>  We wanted the new logo to be both modern and classic, reflecting the spirit of international typographic style (Swiss design), which had a huge impact on our Metro concept.  Thanks to the use of flat colors and clean lines and shapes, the new logo has in common with the design elements of airports and subways. </li><li>  It was important for us that the new logo reflected our Metro-principle ‚ÄúAuthentically Digital‚Äù.  By this principle, we mean that the logo is not trying to disguise itself as the false effects of glass, wood, plastic, etc., trying to appear as an object of the material world.  The logo contains movement synchronized with the dynamic and changeable style that you will find in Windows 8. </li><li>  Our main goal was to have a new logo simple, but inspiring confidence.  The logo welcomes you with a small perspective slope, and when you change the color scheme of the system, the logo changes, adjusting to your preferences.  You have a personal computer, after all. </li></ol><br> <a href=""><img src="http://windowsteamblog.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/CommunityServer-Blogs-Components-WeblogFiles/00-00-00-59-23-metablogapi/0363.Win8Logo_5F00_01_5F00_thumb_5F00_3BD7EB9B.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br>  We hope you like our new logo. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/138444/">https://habr.com/ru/post/138444/</a></p>
