The hottest discussion was around <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hosting_and_domens/103377/">the Ru-Center initiative to register the domain name .moscow</a> . <br><br>  Basically, the idea is criticized, sarcastically offering options like .petropavlovskkamchatskiy or .severodonetsk - they say, that's what kind of garbage it will be if everyone who wants can register their domains.  The idea is clear - it was invented once to systematize the Internet space, the domain system does not cope with the functions assigned to it: division into countries, division into types, now the division into cities is nonsense, the structure becomes so complex that it is easier to get confused in it Know that you pay money to protect your trademark in all possible ways.  It seems that cybersquatters have a powerful lobby in ICANN. <br><br>  It should be understood that the division by countries is limping from a purely ideological point of view - the Internet is supranational, and the Internet business in particular.  Choosing a domain name unwittingly serves as a kind of psychological leash - will we work only in .ru or swipe at .com?  And if the second, is it not necessary to register your domain name in another hundred national domains in order to close the loophole to the scammers?  There is a solution, and not even one.  I, at least, have matured two options:

    <a name="habracut"></a><h4>  Simpler </h4><br>  Systematization is a good thing, and it‚Äôs absolutely impossible to refuse it - it will be a mess.  Let's think about what criterion is eligible to serve as a first level separator?  Country?  The Internet is extraterritorial.  Cities?  Especially?  Content types, business types simply do not cover and cannot cover all the diversity of these categories, which brings us back to national domains and all the disadvantages associated with it. <br><br>  By the way, we must take into account the fact that countries, of course, do not go bankrupt as often as companies - but, nevertheless, on the scale of decades, they also dynamically appear and disappear.  Here the country will disappear - and the domain will remain.  But the domain of a non-existent country is a mine under the very idea of ‚Äã‚Äãterritorial division. <br><br>  In fact, the intrinsic boundaries of the Internet have long been defined, and run past domains ‚Äî these are language barriers.  And it is the language division that makes sense to leave - with a clear condition that only Russian-language sites can exist in the .ru domain, and Russian-language sites cannot exist somewhere other than the .ru domain.  Thus, the problem of cybersquatting is eliminated at once - for example, transnational corporations will have no difficulty in registering the domains of all languages ‚Äã‚Äãspoken by their consumers.  On the other hand, the online store pupkin.ru, which supplies nesting dolls and balalaika around the world, will not have to fear that some pupkin.ro will begin to steal customers - because such a site can only be in Romanian, and therefore work on Romanian audience. <br><br>  At the same time, this separation has practically taken place - .com contains, de facto, English-language sites, .ru - Russian-language, .cn, .fr, .de, etc. <br><br>  In order not to bring the idea to the point of absurdity, we can limit ourselves to the rule - no more than two language domains for countries with a multilingual population, except for languages ‚Äã‚Äãthat are official in other countries - this will remove the problem of domains for rare and little-used languages ‚Äã‚Äã- almost all of them speak another, more common and state in one country or another, and the sites in these languages ‚Äã‚Äãare quite suitable for them. <br><br>  Actually, this idea does not even cancel the existence of purely business domains such as .travel or .aero - the main thing is that the placement of sites in other languages ‚Äã‚Äãis prohibited in language domains.  Then the problem of cybersquatting will be removed by itself. <br><br>  By the way, the same method will solve the problems of phishing arising in connection with the breeding of national, such as, domain, domains - no substitutions will be impossible .. RF?  Excuse Russian letters to use. <br><br><h4>  More difficult </h4><br>  Any phenomenon can be fought in two ways: by banning, or, conversely, removing all restrictions ‚Äî then the non-viable system will destroy itself.  In the case of the registration of domains for this, you can simply step by step, but quickly remove all restrictions and conventions for the registration of domains.  Simply introducing a hierarchy - transnational corporations and megacities will be the first to go - the domains .mcdonalds, .cocacola, .newyork will again remove the problems with cybersquatting at the global level and make life easier for users.  Then - smaller cities (regional centers, state capitals) and companies at the country level, then all the other trademark owners of various levels, and, finally, to release the domains for free sale.  In this case, there may be clashes because of the owners of the same site names in different domains of the first level - but the worst thing that can happen in this case is that the loser will simply remain at the same address. <br><br>  From the point of view of user convenience, this solution is also optimal - the trend is that most users of domains do not bother, all these ‚Äúdot.ru‚Äù and ‚Äúdotcom.‚Äù Have become a fashionable part of word-building and branding, but in real life, users simply clog the name of the desired site without any domains in the search box and follow the first link.  Moreover, combining the search and address lines has become an unconditional find and a powerful trend - it remains only to bring the idea to a logical conclusion, reducing the number of clicks from two - in the search line and the search result - to one: in the address-search line.  Figax - and you're on the site. <br><br>  The idea is a little more difficult to implement - you can‚Äôt do without jambs, ships and spent nerves, but, unlike idea ‚Ññ 1, the transition process is finite.  But the control that the language domains contain only sites in the appropriate language will be needed all the time. <br><br>  In general, all ideas are good - choose to your taste.  But the topic of domain doctors one way or another can be closed.  Already not bad. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/103463/">https://habr.com/ru/post/103463/</a></p>
