  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Xhtml The simplicity and order available to everyone.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <font>In the days of the ‚Äúinfancy‚Äù of the Internet, a lot of things were forgiven to him: the lack of high-quality paperwork, the lack of ergonomic interfaces, incorrectness for several reasons, the programming code of languages ‚Äã‚Äãand much more.</font>  <font>It was because the Internet itself was a kind of know-how, if you like, and was distributed on an ‚Äúas is‚Äù basis.</font>  <font>It was the era of Web 1.0, as it would be called later.</font>  <font>Today, we are contemporaries of the Web, which, with the help of Tim O'Reilly, was named Web 2.0, which means reaching a new quality level, when professionals come to web development who do not draw with a mouse, care about the usability of their product, are responsible for the correctness of each line of code and for its security.</font>  <font>The work of these professionals speak for themselves.</font>  <font>These are people who understand and accept the entire burden of responsibility for how the Web will become after them.</font> <font><a name="habracut"></a></font>  <font>Today, the Web language is perhaps the most popular markup language for documents - HTML.</font>  <font>This is exactly the machine language that allows information to be conveyed to the user via a browser, but is it the only one accessible to the web developer? HTML is a descendant of the markup language purely theoretical, academic, if you like, SGML.</font>  <font>At one time, it was he who was chosen as the basis for a new hypertext document language for the Internet.</font>  <font>In its first revision, HTML clearly followed the SGML philosophy, i.e.</font>  <font>purely logical data formatting.</font>  <font>Out of a little over 40 tags in version 1.2, it included only 3, which could be considered as stylistic.</font>  <font>It should be noted that this was fully justified even from a purely practical point of view, since</font>  <font>At that time, text browsers dominated, and NCSA Mosaic became the first and only graphic browser.</font>  <font>However, after the sale of Mosaic to Microsoft, new products supporting graphic content from both the Redmond giant and third-party manufacturers entered the market.</font>  <font>And the natural desire for the developer was the use of graphic elements for the design of your document.</font>  <font>However, at first, the absence of any language of stylistic design, and then, with the advent of it (CSS), its weak support, gave rise to many design tags in the HTML itself.</font>  <font>And as the efforts of w3c itself, the organization that develops recommendations and standards on the Internet, and browser developers. The last approved and published version of HTML was HTML 4.01 of 12/24/1999, which in its version of Strict took the first step to order in the code, canceling many stylistic tags and their attributes, suggesting instead to use the corresponding features of the CSS specially created for this language.</font>  <font>At the time of publication of the latest HTML specification, the powerful, actual unlimited XML language was already firmly on its feet.</font>  <font>Looking to a bright and perfect future, w3c decided that it was XML that would become a cross-platform data exchange standard, which would open up the possibility of sharing with other XML languages ‚Äã‚Äãand would allow putting HTML itself in order, eliminating its obsolete elements and expanding functionality.</font>  <font>The first step to this was the creation of an intermediate language - XHTML.</font>  <font>So, on May 12, 1998, in parallel with the work on improving HTML, the first edition of XHTML was published. What is it like?</font>  <font>XHTML is a hypertext markup language for documents that is a subset of XML and conforms to the SGML specification, i.e.</font>  <font>in fact, this is HTML, reformulated in XML syntax.</font>  <font>The language was spared from the design tools still remaining in HTML.</font>  <font>In fact, everything returned to normal.</font>  <font>The purpose of the XHTML markup language was to describe the structure of the documents, and CSS was given the role to fully take on the appearance of the hypertext documents. Today, XHTML can be spoken of as becoming a hypertext markup language family.</font>  <font>XHTML is a step towards the evolution of the Internet and the transition to pure XML, while maintaining the backward compatibility of documents for legacy types of user agents.</font>  <font>The current published version is XHTML 1.1 dated February 16, 2007.</font> <font><br></font>  <font>XHTML is the successor to HTML and has a number of natural advantages over it.</font>  <font>So why is it worth it to practice?</font> <ol><li>  XHTML is the current hypertext markup standard that replaces HTML and is recommended for general use. </li><li>  XHTML is more consistent and rigorous than HTML, its use reduces the likelihood of errors in the code, thus increasing the overall quality of the hypertext document and the level of web development in general. </li><li>  XHTML, due to strict syntax, is parsed by the user agent parser easier and faster, unlike HTML, which allows its processing on devices with small computing resources. </li><li>  XHTML is a subset of the XML language, which allows us to significantly expand the possibilities of working with documents through the use of technologies such as XSLT, SVG, MathML, RSS, VoiceXML, Web3D, RDF / XML, XMP, XUL, SOAP, Ajax and Jabber / XMPP) .  In the future, it will allow the use of all new, perhaps, as yet un-acquired or unapproved XML-technologies. </li><li>  XHTML allows you to properly and fully use applications (such as scripts and applets) related to the Document Object Model. </li><li>  XHTML opens the way to the world of metadata, which can be argued with a high degree of probability that in future will allow search engines to more correctly and accurately process data in XHTML documents (read the site pages).  Now it has become a reality in the form of microformats. </li></ol></div>
