  <section class="page js-page"><h1>10 technologies that must die in 2010</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Some ancient gadgets otmuchalis and quietly died a natural death.  All these pagers, PDAs, floppy drives - they are no longer with us. <br><br>  But other outdated technologies will not go away into another world, although it is already time, because there are better alternatives, simpler, cheaper, high-quality and effective.  Here is a list of 10 technologies that we should get rid of in 2010. <br><br>  <b>1. Fax</b> <br>  The fax machine is outdated 15 years ago.  This is nothing more than a set of a printer, scanner and an archaic analog modem that only consumes wasted time, money, paper and electricity. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

      <br>
      Documents sent by fax are usually initially digital.  To send it by fax, you must first print the document.  You insert the printout into the fax machine and the fax machine again converts it to digital form, and then, using an analog modem from the 1993 sample, converts the digital image into sounds and transmits information in sound. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The modem generates noise over the telephone line, and at the other end of the line another fax machine with a modem listens to these sounds and translates them back to digital format, just before printing on paper.  And after that, it is usually necessary again to translate this piece of paper into digital format: either manually fill in the information or scan the fax. <br><br>  A document almost always starts and ends its life in digital form.  But during his epic journey, he visited four times in digital form, twice in paper form and once in the form of sound. <br><br>  The massive misconception that supports the life of this outdated technology is that the "hard copy" is supposedly more legitimate.  In fact, sticking someone else‚Äôs signature to a document before sending it by fax is the easiest way to scam because of the quality of the fax image. <br><br>  People stop this madness.  Let's use e-mail. <br><br>  <b>2. Car cigarette lighter plug</b> <br>  The idea to place a cigar / cigarette lighter on a car dashboard appeared in the 20s of the last century and reached its ideal embodiment by the 50th.  Decades have passed, but the automotive industry still supplies cars with these strange connectors, but now usually without a lighter. <br><br>  As an electrical connector, the cigarette lighter socket is very dangerous, unreliably has excess energy, inconvenient, inconspicuous and expensive.  For it, you need to buy a special adapter and / or adapter, which further clutters the interior of the car. <br><br>  All machines must be equipped with standard sockets with a built-in converter.  Or a USB port through which gadgets can be charged.  Or both. <br><br>  Almost no one smokes in his car.  Almost all of us carry with us mobile phones and gadgets that need energy.  God, what other arguments do these guys need from the car industry? <br><br>  <b>3. www</b> <br>  According to the original idea, the prefix in the Internet address should indicate the type of service.  For example, <i><a href="http://www.xn--80aawfn4aj4h.com/">www.imyasayta.com</a></i> points to the ‚ÄúWorld-Wide Web‚Äù servers for viewing through a browser, and <i>ftp.myasayta.com</i> indicates the services available through File Transfer Protocol. <br><br>  Network administrators are now choosing whether it will be technically necessary to have the <i>www</i> prefix in the site address, but the browser will automatically add it anyway. <br><br>  That is why there is no need to say <i>www</i> in front of the address, type it on business cards or type it manually in the browser.  We stopped specifying the prefix <i>http: // a</i> few years ago, so now you can refuse from <i>www</i> . <br><br>  <b>4. Business cards</b> <br>  It is completely incomprehensible why we still use these ‚Äúphone cards‚Äù from the 19th century.  When you receive such a card, you are required to take the boring job of putting this information somewhere, and usually nobody does it. <br><br>  There are several alternatives for business cards, and they are all excellent.  If a meeting is scheduled by e-mail, you can attach contact information, attach vCards, links to web pages with contact information, and much more. <br><br>  Even if you are suddenly confronted with someone, it is better to exchange contact information on the spot using a mobile phone.  It is easier to press a few buttons on the phone to save an incoming call than manually enter information from a business card. <br><br>  <b>5. Movie rental</b> <br>  Already several revolutions have happened since we went to the Vildeocassett rental kiosk, stood in a queue, took the coveted film and went home with it.  A movie is a regular digital file.  You can download it, receive it by mail on disk, etc.  Go somewhere, stand in line for a digital file?  Come on! <br><br>  <b>6. Remote Controls for Home Systems</b> <br>  Almost every element of the home media system comes with its own overly complicated remote control.  One at the TV.  One is in a digital video recorder.  Another one on the Blu-ray player.  Even the music system has its own remote.  But some people at home have several TVs, music players, stereos, and other remotely controlled electronics, so the number of remotes in the apartment exceeds a dozen.  For each of them, it is necessary to change toxic batteries and constantly monitor the location (consoles tend to get lost). <br><br>  It is unlikely that at least someone has enough time for quality service and programming of their D / U consoles.  Enough!  It's time to replace these consoles with programs for mobile phones. <br><br>  Mobile phones can be great remotes, because they have a better user interface, rechargeable batteries and they are not easily lost.  Phone programs are easier to program and upgrade. <br><br>  Already released several excellent programs for the iPhone and other devices that control digital video recorders and more.  Apple managed to make a really simple interface to control iTunes from the iPhone. <br><br>  TV manufacturers need to improve the functionality of the control menu on TVs, and join the smartphone revolution, create simple programs for remote control, with universal programs so that all devices can be controlled from one program. <br><br>  <b>7. Corded phones</b> <br>  The number of US households that completely abandoned wired telephones doubled from 2006 to 2009, and now there is no wired telephone in every fourth apartment. <br><br>  What are the other three quarters waiting for?  Corded phones are overkill, headache and lost time (because the wrong person you are calling can pick up the phone).  Corded phones can not receive text messages or are equipped with completely outdated answering machines.  It's time to make the last call on this phone - call the operator and ask to save you from the phone line. <br><br>  <b>8. Music CDs</b> <br>  With music CDs everything is fine, they simply have no significant advantages over MP3s, while there are drawbacks: they are made from toxic materials, they are difficult to recycle and uncomfortable to carry around. <br><br>  We all have to go completely to digital formats, a music library from files that are suitable for searching, backing up and transporting in any quantity. <br><br>  <b>9. Satellite radio</b> <br>  Of course, the Sirius XM content is different, but you don't need to launch rockets and orbital satellites to deliver the sound to the listener's radio.  All this can be done through the Internet and through the iPhone application, which was shown by the very same Sirius XM radio station when it provided just such a service. <br><br>  There are situations when satellite radio has an advantage.  For example, when you go on the road without coverage of cellular networks, and listen to actual content, such as news.  But most of us are rarely chosen in such a jungle, and the majority of satellite radio content is not so relevant.  In addition, you can not listen to it when you park in an underground garage, for example.  Or near tall buildings, or in tunnels. <br><br>  Now there is a lot of high-quality audio content that can be listened to in the car: audio books, podcasts, MP3 music, etc.  If you so need to pay for something, it is better to subscribe to the tariff plan of the wireless mobile Internet. <br><br>  <b>10. Excess registration</b> <br>  Many sites offer users a form of registration, which is to add personal data, select a username and password.  This is normal. <br><br>  But why do some sites require you to enter an email address twice?  After all, they still verify it later.  Why do they ask my city and zip code if it is already possible to determine a city by zip code? <br><br>  Bad, redundant and outdated technologies make our lives harder, more expensive and uglier.  Let's get rid of them. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/79288/">https://habr.com/ru/post/79288/</a></p>
