No, I do not stand in traffic jams and do not go to the gym in the morning.  The road to work is two steps.  And literally - two steps from the bed to the computer.  I just live in Brazil, and I work in Russia, in my own online store of luxury underwear and home accessories.  With Moscow, there are 7 hours of difference, and I have to get up at dawn.  And in order to wake up vigorous, energetic and in 3-4 hours not to fall into bed, I tried many ways to wake up.  And now I will share them with you. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Given </h4><br>  When I lived in Russia, I did not have a regime.  I got up painfully on weekdays to study at about 7:30, and on weekends I slept until noon.  When I moved to Brazil, I realized that the schedule had to be seriously shifted in order to work at the same time that Moscow was working.  But one thing is when you wake up with difficulty on an alarm clock and in an hour you are already studying or in the office.  And it is quite another thing when you stay at home.  Before the eyes is still a warm bed.  To force yourself not to lie again is very hard.  And I had to be concentrated, to be in working mode, to sit at the computer all day. <br>  And I began to look for ways to start vigorously, but such that there is enough energy for the whole day.  Something learned on Habr√©.  Something had to experience for yourself.  But now I can share the techniques found with you and say exactly which ones work and which ones don't. <br><br><h5>  Solution 1: energetic charging </h5><br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>How does it work?</b>  Scientists claim that we inherited some residual functions of amphibian ancestors.  And one of them is a change in body temperature during the day.  Women ‚Äúcool down‚Äù at night to 35.7, and men to 34.9.  If you have noticed, sometimes during a sound sleep someone sweats a lot - this is just the mechanism of thermoregulation.  But by heating the body, we start the reverse process - wakefulness. <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>My experience.</b>  I did very intense exercises.  We have an ocean 5 minutes from the house.  Therefore, I pulled myself out of bed at 5 on an alarm clock, ran along the ocean, played sports.  And immediately after, I felt a surge of strength and energy, but the effect disappeared in just a couple of hours, and I wanted to sleep again. <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Conclusion.</b>  Charging helps you wake up quickly, but does not guarantee an energetic day.  Psychologically difficult to start.

    <h4>  Solution 2: a contrast shower or washing with ice </h4><br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>How does it work?</b>  Hard!  But effective.  Because  the body is cooled from the outside, then it tries to warm up from the inside, thereby increasing the rate of blood circulation.  The body in a few seconds begins to work at maximum speed. <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>My experience.</b>  I ran in the mornings and then swam in the ocean.  It turns out that she combined body warming up and a douche in the form of an ocean.  Yes, the cold water felt euphoria.  But all the same in the afternoon the sleepy state fell on, and madly it would be desirable to sleep.  Earlier in Moscow, I took an icy shower after a hot one, washed with ice.  The effect is the same - a short-term outburst of forces that comes to naught in the afternoon.  But the girls will be interested in a cosmetic effect: the skin becomes magical, dryness disappears without any creams. <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Conclusion.</b>  It's simple, accessible to all and works.  With an ice shower, you wake up, even if you went to bed 5 minutes ago.  But not for long. <br><br><h5>  Solution 3: adaptogens and stimulants </h5><br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>How do they work?</b>  The former help the body to adapt to environmental factors (for example, increase efficiency, if your environment is an office).  The second - stimulate the physical activity of the body. <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>My experience.</b>  In Brazil, I had the opportunity to use exotic natural ‚Äúenergetics‚Äù in the morning, stronger than coffee ‚Äî this is guarana syrup and acai syrup.  Guaranu, you all know by energy Burn.  And Acai is a palm fruit that holds the world record for antioxidants.  Despite the fact that I live in Brazil, fresh guarana or acai berries are not easy to find.  These are southern fruits, growing in the Amazon region.  And we live in the very north of the country.  So I bought syrup or frozen berries.  I can not say that I felt the desired effect.  Perhaps thanks to the Brazilian berries, I managed to keep myself from the temptation to lie down in a hammock for an hour or two, but they did not give that desired state of vigor and natural vigor that I was trying to achieve. <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Conclusion.</b>  If energy and work, it is very unnoticeable. <br><br><h5>  Solution 4: Aromatherapy </h5><br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>How does it work?</b>  Stimulating or soothing essential oils act at the pharmacological level, reacting with hormones, enzymes, and acids of the body.  Plus adds a psychological or emotional reaction to different flavors. <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>My experience.</b>  Aromatic accessories appeared in my online store.  And I just had to test them for the promised wonderful effects.  It is generally accepted that invigorating fragrances include conifers, citrus smells, sage, mint.  To soothing - lavender, lemon balm, oregano, frankincense.  All flavors need to be selected strictly individually: for example, I am not affected by the aphrodisiac ylang-ylang at all.  After numerous tests, lavender settled in my bedroom, and a pomegranate was on my desk.  And the most convenient way of aromatherapy for me is a reed diffuser, it looks nice and does not burn. <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Conclusion.</b>  It turned out that the aromas have a beneficial effect on me personally - as if lavender really helps to fall asleep faster, and the garnet invigorates.  Can be used as an aid. <br><br><h5>  Solution 5: the selection of the rise time in increments of ¬± 10 minutes </h5><br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>How does it work?</b>  It is believed that it is important to wake up during superficial fast sleep, when the body is in the mode of half-waking.  Then there will not be a feeling that you are not sleepy, that you were pulled out from the middle of a dream.  In the morning, a slow deep sleep and a fast one can alternate every 40 minutes.  And in order to catch your slow sleep, you need to set the alarm every time 10 minutes earlier or later, until the rise seems easy. <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>My experience.</b>  After 3-4 days of experiments, I found that for me the most comfortable waking up time was 4:40 and 5:20.  It was immediately clear to me whether I woke up at the right time for myself or not.  The forces were in the morning.  There was no question of rearranging the alarm for another 5 minutes.  I didn't want to sleep any more - I wanted to jump out of bed and get to work. <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Conclusion.</b>  100% hit!  Be sure to use this technique! <br><br><h5>  Solution 6: an alarm program that distinguishes the phases of sleep </h5><br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>How does it work?</b>  Unlike the previous method, the time does not need to pick up.  The phone recognizes the fast sleep phase of your movements. <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>My experience.</b>  It is believed that Sleep Cycle and Smart Alarm Clock are the best for iPhones, and Sleep-as-an-Droid for androids.  I used the application for iPhone Smart Alarm Clock.  The alarm does not recognize the sleep phase, if it lies on the bedside table.  I had to put it under the pillow.  It‚Äôs not very comfortable for me to sleep like that - first, I can throw it on the floor at any time.  And secondly, in the head we thought about how it is harmful to sleep on the phone.  But we must pay tribute to the program: I set the alarm at 5:30.  He woke me up at 5:20 - this is my experimentally determined time. <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Conclusion.</b>  Works.  But not a very convenient method.  And only suitable for those who sleep alone.  You can use it once, if you go to bed at the same time, and then start a normal alarm clock. <br><br><h5>  Solution 7: alarm lamp </h5><br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>How does it work?</b>  It is known that by the light of the sleep hormone melatonin is destroyed, the awakening hormone cortisol begins to be produced.  Smart lamp turns on for half an hour before the desired time.  But not immediately at full power, but gradually increasing the brightness.  At the same time birds start singing and making noise in the forest - louder and louder.  Plus, the melody will sound at the right time. <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>My experience.</b>  Not exactly mine, but friends, she had a Philips Wake-up Light lamp.  She says that she woke up almost at the first dim rays, and then she was tormented for another half hour - she tried to sleep until X hour.  And her husband, on the contrary, never woke up at all - he spat in the woods, birds and music to the morning. <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Conclusion.</b>  This is a more humane way to wake up than from a sharp beeping or wake-up call.  But with its minuses. <br><br><h5>  Solution 8: Ayurvedic sleep </h5><br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>How does it work?</b>  Omit the lecture on energy and chakras.  According to the Vedas, it is believed that you need to sleep with the sun.  And every hour of sleep from 21:00 to 00:00 for the body is 2 times more effective than sleep after midnight.  And if you go to bed at 21:00 and sleep for 6 hours, then the person gets enough sleep just like the person who lay down at 00:00 and slept 9 hours.  Total savings of 3 hours. <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>My experience.</b>  The most difficult thing to go to at 21:00 - life is just beginning!  But I forced myself.  And she woke up at 3:00!  I thought it was an accident, and put myself to bed again.  But the next day, again, like an alarm clock - rise at 3:00.  She got up, worked a little at the computer.  I did not want to do household chores in order not to wake anyone up.  Opened the book ... Well, you probably guessed what was next ... <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Conclusion.</b>  This is a very effective, but absolutely asocial method.  I am sure that I would have enough energy for the whole day if I could immediately be actively engaged in something.  But, alas, all around live on a completely different schedule. <br><br><h4>  The most important conclusion </h4><br>  At the end of my treatise, I can rejoice all those who read to the end.  I now easily get up at 5 am, I work vigorously all day. <br><br>  <b>So, what ultimately helped?</b>  <b>Everything in the complex:</b> <br>  ‚Ä¢ But at the head of everything mode!  You need to force yourself to wake up early at the same time.  Do not go to bed during the day.  And so two weeks.  And on weekends - the same thing! <br>  ‚Ä¢ If there is a regime, then everything else works only for the benefit and enhances the effect - and washing with ice, and sport in the morning, and adaptogens!  But without the regime for me, none of the above does not work. <br>  ‚Ä¢ It‚Äôs still necessary to go to bed early.  Even now it is not easy for me to wake up if I fall asleep after midnight.  So I try to stay up no later than half past nine. <br>  ‚Ä¢ And I almost forgot about the desire to wake up!  When you wait for the next day, when you want to quickly get to work and a lot of plans, then you fall asleep happy, and wake up in anticipation! <br><br>  And for dessert, I left you some ways I had not tried - suddenly, someone wants to continue my experiment: <br>  ‚Ä¢ The Budist website is such a nice project where girls wake up the boys on the phone, and the boys wake up the girls, all for free and voluntarily. <br>  ‚Ä¢ To bring a cat - they say they have breakfast strictly at the same time and wake their owners with a purr. <br>  Good morning everyone! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/149159/">https://habr.com/ru/post/149159/</a></p>
