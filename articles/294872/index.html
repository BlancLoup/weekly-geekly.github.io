Nevertheless, a number of resources devoted to online trading, retained their visitors, traffic on such sites for the year increased by 63.7%, <a href="http://kommersant.ru/doc/2819973">writes</a> "Kommersant".  ComScore specialists conducted an analysis of attendance of the ten largest sites on the Runet in three categories: financial media, bank websites and online trading sites. <br><br>  According to the study, a significant increase in resource attendance in all three categories occurred in December.  According to experts, the growth of traffic is triggered by currency fluctuations and a banking crisis.  In December 2014, there was a peak in the growth of the value of currencies against the dollar, and by the end of the year the ruble exchange rate had fallen by 70% against the dollar and by about 50% against the euro. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In the same December 2014, Sberbank‚Äôs site traffic increased from 12.36 million Russians in November to 14.69 million in December.  The total time spent by resource visitors on the site increased from 260 million to 329 million minutes.  However, already in January, these indicators began to decline, and in July 2015, the traffic and viewing duration decreased to last year's figure.  A similar situation was observed with the attendance of sites of other banks.

      Audience of financial resources behaved in the same way.  Thus, the websites dedicated to finance received maximum traffic and user activity in December - then attendance rose from 13.4 million in November to 15.3 million. But after the surge, the audience of news sites was lower than a year earlier. <br><br>  As mentioned above, the only category of resources that has preserved new users is trading sites.  Here, the total audience of sites has grown from 3.8 million in November to 6.8 million in December.  In January-February, the growth of visitors also continued, and in April reached a peak - 8.59 million. As a result, the audience of such sites increased from 3.83 million in July last year to 6.27 in July 2015.  The increase was 63.7%. <br><br>  ‚ÄúRecently there was another surge, but now the people are gradually calming down.  In addition to a jump in exchange rates, an increase in attendance can be explained by fear for plastic cards and accounts: an increase in attendance occurs, for example, when licenses are withdrawn from banks, ‚ÄùAnton Arnautov, head of the Bankir.ru portal, commented on the situation. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/294872/">https://habr.com/ru/post/294872/</a></p>
