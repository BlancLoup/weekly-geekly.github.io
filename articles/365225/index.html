Of course, if we add to them the corresponding elements in the form of a frame and wheels.  So, what the world e-bike industry offers us today and what horizons are opening tomorrow - we read in our review. <br><br>  Since in our country electric beats are a fairly new topic and are mostly exhausted by the products of Chinese engineers - we note it is not always bad - still, we refer to the recognized experts from Electric Bike Review for the rating of the best models for different purposes. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

      <b>Sandviper by SSR Motosport</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/410/569/104/4105691044ae47a7a8bcbb8afb515fe5.png"><br><br>  The best model in the Ferris version in the category of SUVs.  Bike is made in the States and refers to the second class on a local scale.  That is, the speed is limited to 20 miles per hour and a motor power of 750 watts.  In this model, the speed at the limit with a drive power of 350 watts.  The whole complex is powered by Li-Ion 36 V and 10 Ah batteries. <br><br>  All-aluminum construction, including wheel rims, reduces the total weight to 20 kg.  And, of course, as you noticed, very wide 4-inch cameras make it possible to rush through the mud, and over unmelted snow, and along the sands - if anyone gets there.  It is a real money bike - <a href="http://www.ssrmotorsports.com/store/ebicycle/sandviper.html">$ 1399</a> for 25 miles away on a single charge on any dert. <br><br>  <b>Motiv spark</b> <br><br>  The best urban e-cruiser of the last two years in America. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c1f/a9a/854/c1fa9a85462a44fb875fc66aa32c66f7.png"><br><br>  Simple in construction and reliable as no other - the manufacturer gives a lifetime warranty on the hydroformed aluminum frame (18 inches) and two years on the drive.  By the way, the whole energy potential for the city is optimally calculated: up to 70 km per recharge from a compact Li-Ion battery of 48 V and 10 Ah, motor power 500 W and maximum speed up to 30 km / h. <br><br>  You can buy it at the <a href="http://sandiegoflyrides.com/motiv/">office</a> for $ 1750, the weight for transportation is about 25 kg. <br><br>  <b>Volton Alation 500</b> <br><br>  The best mountain e-bike of last year is equally good both in the city and on the road. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/05a/01d/070/05a01d070037451a833472120580f877.png"><br><br>  The Samsung battery (48 V, 11 Ah) built into the aluminum frame allows you to travel up to 80 km, and the 500 W motor accelerates it to the same 30 km / h. <br><br>  All specifications can be found here, there and buy - <a href="http://www.voltonbicycles.com/alation-500/">$ 2200</a> with free delivery in the States. <br><br>  <b>Concepts</b> <br><br>  And now to promising technologies and concept stories.  Naturally, electric.  And we start with the prototype 2012 from Audi, still not giving rest to many cyclists in the world.  Largely because of the price, of course, because they are asking for it as much as $ 20,000! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/34d/705/b33/34d705b33f7a4bb6b0582052d2c2e451.png"><br><br>  But not only.  What other bike will you fly at speeds of up to 80 km / h?  And every element of this concept is an engineering marvel.  Starting from a unique carbon frame with a total weight of only 1.6 kg and flat spokes, the aerodynamics of which were engaged for almost a year, to the most sophisticated electronics, which are stuffed with every element of the bike. <br><br>  How the existing model behaves in the case, you can see <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DT2zpU7StU3Q">here</a> , and we only add that it works great in three modes - clean pedals, combined and ‚Äúremember me like this‚Äù - when a 2.3 kW electric motor with a maximum torque of 250 Nm is cut. <br><br>  It is clear that such a miracle does not fall under any category of permitted vehicles either in the USA or in Europe.  So what is pure for the soul. <br><br>  But for quite specific areas of application - from couriers and city services to service workers and even the police - Ford plans to produce its e-bike. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9ca/524/c3f/9ca524c3fc3644fea8959901ea3f4a2f.png"><br><br>  Unfortunately, this prototype, presented at CNET'15, cannot boast of any outstanding speed data - 15 miles per hour, and the motor is only 200 watts.  But‚Ä¶ <br><br>  No wonder he was presented at the Mobile World Congress - in synergy with a smartphone, this bike can be very useful and utilitarian.  For example, if you activate an application that controls your cardioparameters, then when you reach the upper heartbeat bar, the bicycle motor turns on automatically - you are resting. <br><br>  If you use the navigator, then when turning right-left, the corresponding side of the steering wheel starts to vibrate.  And there are many such chips, you can read <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/litemf/blog/247136/">here</a> .  The only obvious disadvantage is a weak power supply.  The battery is only enough for half an hour of movement. <br><br>  <b>Unusual news</b> <br><br>  And finally, two of the most unusual bikes of the last time. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe most folding of all folding ones‚Äù - this is exactly what an aluminum mechanical prototype can be called, which when folded does not exceed the size of a standard wheel of 26 inches. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/480/dd0/758/480dd0758e824af88f53661794dc0742.png"><br><br>  Minimalistic industrial design in the style of Bauhaus and imaginary functionality.  In the museum is that.  But definitely not on our dirt with such a low drive. <br><br>  Remember, Khazanov: ‚ÄúZaporozhets is good for everyone, only the machine gun on the roof is not enough!‚Äù In general, for everyone waiting for the onset of the Apocalypse or, at least, zombie invasions - this is such a ‚Äúbike for survival‚Äù from Motoped. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a49/59a/345/a4959a34557d4f86a2c5d8f7e5af078c.png"><br><br>  Balanced dvupodvesnaya frame, combo drive - you can pedal your feet, and if you find fuel, then the power unit from the Honda XR / CRF50 is not prohibited.  Well, specially designed trunk for the most necessary in case of a nuclear war: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8b2/d2f/360/8b2d2f3604884c9a9a64286682e0df49.png"><br><br>  By the way, instead of a crossbow, it‚Äôs quite possible to adapt a small machine gun.  So keep in mind. <br><br>  As we see, there are plenty of ideas in the world of bicycle construction.  But how much they will be in demand - the question remains open. <br><br> <a href="http://litemf.com/ru/price"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/521/d7d/506/521d7d506c53477494e0b40d66252dba.png"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/365225/">https://habr.com/ru/post/365225/</a></p>
