It became interesting to learn more about this program, since at that time the development for Windows Phone was still my hobby, and several applications were published on the market.  <s>In general, it was then that I just needed a million ...</s> <br><br>  I registered in the program and looked around, everything turned out to be simple, you complete the task, you get points that you can spend in the store.  The set of prizes is quite varied, from chargers to top Nokia devices.  Of particular interest to me were telephones and software licenses.  Having decided on the prizes, I began to study the tasks in detail, singled out the tasks for the quality of the applications among the variety presented.  The essence of the tasks was that it was necessary to provide an application with an estimate of more than 4. And the number of points that could be obtained depended on the number of votes. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cb5/c1b/39d/cb5c1b39d86c500db1466855bb7249b8.png" alt="Application Quality Assignments" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10">  The first problem appeared immediately after registration, my applications were not automatically connected by the site.  After waiting for the allotted time and just in case, I wrote the same amount in support.  The answer came very quickly: "I used all my wudd magic and your applications appeared in the list of applications."  The answer in such a style very good cheered me up and I, without delay, began to implement the updates as required by the rules.

      At this stage, the Market certification team was pleased; the application that passed certification during the year more than once suddenly turned out to be breaking the rules.  I had to learn in practice the design of technical exemptions in the certification process.  The next stumbling block was the system of counting votes on the DVLUP website, but this problem was solved with the help of the support team. <br><br>  Having passed this way, he completed the tasks and received at his own expense the cherished balls, which at the same time were exposed in the order of phones.  A day later, an employee of the company contacted me and asked for data to pay taxes, as it turned out DVLUP, in addition to the prizes, pays personal income tax, for these prizes, so getting prizes does not have to get with them 35% of taxes. <br><br>  This morning, on December 31, the courier called me and brought my order, a photo of its contents is shown in the first photo.  It turned out a true New Year's gift from Nokia. <br><br>  The problem with test phones has been solved for me, now I have to solve the issue of licensing development tools, I really want to see the license for Unity 3D Pro in the prize catalog <br><br>  Congratulations to all the customers with a happy new year, I wish everyone the fulfillment and realization of all the plans, both ordinary and the most ambitious! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/207938/">https://habr.com/ru/post/207938/</a></p>
