  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What engineers read GridGain. Books for those interested in In-Memory Computing</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Not so long ago, in our corporate chat, a battle unfolded about paper books and books in general.  It turned out that, despite the popularity of blogs and educational videos, there are quite a few people who like to look through a good book on the reading room, or even in paper.  Moreover, I sometimes want to return to some books in order to put everything in my head or look for a solution to a specific problem. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_w/yw/wq/_wywwqmsnlz1mibibrbf803puhg.png" width="400"></div><br>  We even made a small list of books that we really like.  Well, this is also a hint for interviewing <a href="https://www.gridgain.com/company/careers">our fresh jobs</a> , of course.  Not in the sense of remembering a couple of titles, but in the sense of reading, of course. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>New</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xk/xc/27/xkxc279bojtaeuoz9gecjy-r370.jpeg" align="left"><br>  <b><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Java-3rd-Joshua-Bloch/dp/0134685997">Effective Java (3rd Edition) by Joshua Bloch</a> (2018)</b> <br>  This book has not reached us in paper form, because it appeared on sale only on January 6.  But we have already ordered it to the corporate library.  If you have time to read only one book about Java in a year, then this is best.

Scalability, consistency, fault tolerance, relational databases, document, graph ... The book helps to put all these concepts on the shelves and select the right tools for the job.

You know for sure that they have this: a) really big, b) it works.  Most likely, few people will read the collection from cover to cover, but here you can find some very useful articles.  In August, the book will be released in Russian (thanks for the <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/ph_piter/" class="user_link">info ph_piter</a> ). <br><br><br clear="left">  <b>Proven classics</b> <br><br><br clear="left"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_i/fm/zb/_ifmzb3a3rlchmzw_7hqxjrbapg.png" align="left"><br>  <b><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Systems-Performance-Enterprise-Brendan-Gregg/dp/0133390098/ref%3Dsr_1_1%3Fs%3Dbooks%26ie%3DUTF8%26qid%3D1516037092%26sr%3D1-1%26keywords%3DSystems%2BPerformance%2Bby%2BBrendan%2BGregg">Systems Performance: Enterprise and the Cloud by Brendan Gregg</a> (2013)</b> <br>  The book of the architect from Netfix is ‚Äã‚Äãquite detailed for a beginner and at the same time deep enough to return to it when an experienced developer has difficulty in organizing the interaction of the database with the OS or equipment. <br><br><br clear="left"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nl/2f/mm/nl2fmmpz3-95norgjv9tyxbwpcs.jpeg" align="left"><br>  <b><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Software-Testing-Glenford-Sandler-Hardcover/dp/B010CKHRI0/ref%3Dsr_1_1%3Fs%3Dbooks%26ie%3DUTF8%26qid%3D1516036063%26sr%3D1-1%26keywords%3DThe%2BArt%2Bof%2BSoftware%2BTesting%252C%2B3rd%2BEdition">The Art of Software Testing 3rd Edition by Myers and others</a> (2013)</b> <br>  The book is about the approach to testing.  The author logically assumes that a person is too goal-oriented (or lazy) being to seriously break the product he needs to create.  The book contains simple examples of the approach to the testing process, written in easy language.  According to colleagues from Q &amp; A, it is somewhat orthodox, but it makes sense to feel the proposed approach, and then try to do a little more to help the developers with their tests. <br><br><br clear="left"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dk/2h/rs/dk2hrsw--dmk5j9ftsuq49oawsm.jpeg" align="left"><br>  <b><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Distributed-Algorithms-Intuitive-Approach-Press/dp/0262026775/">Distributed Algorithms: An Intuitive Approach (MIT Press) by Wan Fokkink</a> (2013)</b> <br>  The book for immersion in distributed computing.
