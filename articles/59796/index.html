  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Stages of commissioning of the Data Transmission and Telematics services node</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  After obtaining licenses, the telecommunications operator is obliged to start providing telecommunications services no later than the period specified in the license issued, using the communication center built and put into operation.  The process of commissioning a communications center is governed by the ‚ÄúRules for the commissioning of communications facilities‚Äù approved by Order No. 113 of the Ministry of Communications and Informatization of the Russian Federation on September 9, 2002 (they are often simply referred to as ‚ÄúOrder 113‚Äù). <br>  In this small article we will look at the process of commissioning the Data Transmission and Telematic Services node - and this is exactly what is needed by Providers with 2 licenses: for Communication Services for data transmission except for data transmission for voice information, and for Telematic Communications Services. <br><br>  Stages of acceptance of the communication center in operation: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  1. Notification of RosSvyazNadzor about the start of construction of a communication facility. <br>  - A letter is written to the head of the TU RSN about the start of construction of the communication facility. <br><br>  2. Collecting the necessary papers and documents according to 113 orders. <br>  -Here I will quote paragraph 5.4 of 113 orders, and comment on the main points: <br>  During the work of the acceptance committee, the representatives of the UGNSI conduct a survey of the communication structure, perform the necessary measurements and check the applicant (operator) for the following documents: <br>  - licenses to carry out activities for the provision of communication services; <br>  Everything is clear, you need to show the inspectors your licenses + the license of the construction company that has built a PD and TM node for you. <br>  - primary documents confirming the compliance of the work performed and the equipment used with the established requirements (passports, certificates of conformity of the Svyaz certification system, or copies thereof certified by the certificate holder or the Body that issued the certificate, or the mark of conformity of the Svyaz certification system on communications and technical passports for them); <br>  Again, everything is simple.  Either certificates  (switches, billing), or the declaration (server).  For details, see PPPRF No. 896 dated December 31, 2004. Moreover, certificates must be notarized or certified by a certificate holder (manufacturer) !!!  All equipment must have either CAS certificates or declarations.  First of all, pay attention to the active equipment: switches, media converters, billing, server, UPS. <br>  - approved project documentation (PD) and the conclusion of the state expertise of the project.  In this case, the PD should be developed by a legal entity (individual entrepreneur), having the right to perform the relevant design work, and approved taking into account the comments of the project expertise.  For communication facilities specified in Appendix A, it is allowed to use standard designs or factory instructions (technical documentation of the equipment manufacturer) and approved by the operator (customer) the connection scheme and communication building specification containing information on the purpose, composition of communication facilities, conditions operation and technical characteristics of communication facilities.  Examination of projects, survey and measurement for communication facilities listed in Appendix A are not required; <br>  Data Transfer Services do not fall under Appendix A, so the project is also needed as well as the expertise of the project. <br>  - the approved act (protocols) according to the results of tests of the communication facilities, carried out by the operator prior to its presentation for acceptance into operation, for compliance with regulatory documents of the Ministry of Communications of Russia, and in their absence - technical documentation of the equipment manufacturer; <br>  An act in any form is written that the testing was conducted within 24 hours (for example), and the parameters correspond to the design ones.  You can refer to the RD, GOST, RFC, etc. <br>  - a set of operational documentation for the facility, including instructions for the use of communication equipment; <br>  Show instructions on the server / billing. <br>  - in the presence of RES - permits of the bodies of the emergency response system for the use of radio frequencies and for the operation of the RES;  in the presence of RES (with the exception of cable television systems) - sanitary passport for the construction of communications; <br>  Since we have no RES, then the requirement to show the Sanpasport is illegal.  Although it is not difficult to conclude a SES, it is enough to go to your local SES and pay the bill for measurements.  SES issues conclusions without unnecessary questions, if only you paid them;) <br>  - documents confirming the training of specialists for work on the equipment included in the structure, including their knowledge of the rules of technical operation, safety and labor protection (if maintenance personnel are provided for the operation of communication facilities); <br>  If your project does not discuss the fact that the PD and TM node of the services is not serviced, you can show scraps about higher technical education, for example, or some Linux courses <br>  - contracts between operators for accession to the relevant communication network (if it is required in accordance with the current regulatory legal documents); <br>  Show the contract of accession from your superior provider. <br>  - a list of measuring instruments provided for the instructions for use, and information about their verification; <br>  It is necessary to provide in the project - billing works with a measuring instrument and it is not subject to verification. <br>  - documents confirming the organization of events for the implementation of SORM (in cases established by the current regulatory legal documents). <br>  In general, write to the FSB a letter asking you to consider the need to install SORM equipment on your PD and TM services site.  There are 2 scenarios: the FSB will tell you that you do not need SORM.  So you are showing this letter to the RSN, or the FSB will write off what SORM is necessary.  In the second case, write to the FSB a second letter with a request to agree on a plan for implementing SORM on the PD and TM site of the services and attach the plan for a year and a half.  After coordination of the plan, show it in the RSN.  Of the unpleasant moments: an agreed plan will have to be implemented sometime.

      In addition to the above, you will need it or you may need it: <br>  - The completed act on the form of the COP-14, the form is easily on the Internet. <br>  - Samples of contracts with subscribers physical persons and legal entities. <br>  - order on the appointment of a working commission for acceptance of the PD and TM node of services for operation <br>  - Log of the letters, appeals and complaints of users <br>  - Equipment fault log <br>  - Rental agreement <br><br>  3. The notification of RosSvyazNadzor on the completion of the construction of the communication facility, with a request to appoint a representative of the RSN to the acceptance committee. <br>  - again, as in paragraph 1, a notice is written to the head of the TU RSN that you are completing the construction of the site, the commission starts work on such a date and you ask to appoint a representative of the RSN to participate in its work. <br><br>  4. Verification of the PD and TM site of services, papers and documents by the RSN inspector. <br>  - On the appointed day and time, the RSN inspector arrives to you and checks your site on the spot.  There are no unambiguous recommendations on this item - usually everything consists in checking papers and visually inspecting how ‚ÄúBeautiful‚Äù everything is done. <br>  5. The issuance of a permit to operate. <br>  -If everything went well, then usually within 2-3 days you get permission to operate the PD and TM services node. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/59796/">https://habr.com/ru/post/59796/</a></p>
