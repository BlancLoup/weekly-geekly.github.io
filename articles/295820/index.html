We are sure that clients turn to this question not only to lawyers.  The answer lies on the surface: it is necessary to standardize the processes and the proposed documentation, to create convenient products based on them. <br><br>  Over 7 years of work in the legal services market for IT companies, we have accumulated solutions rolled back on many similar projects.  We took them as a basis and developed various models or documentation packages that do not require significant customization costs.

      As a result, a <a href="http://www.it-lex.ru/store">store of ready-made solutions</a> was created, which is offered to your attention. <br><br>  In what benefit from use of complex products for clients and lawyers look under a cat. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>1. The store is not a designer.</b>  In the designer, the user is invited to make an independent choice and modify the template. <br><br>  The disadvantages are obvious: <br>  a) the choice is always limited to 2-3 options; <br>  b) additionally there are gaps that must be filled independently; <br>  c) simple choice presupposes the presence of sufficient competence in the question, not to mention filling in the missing conditions. <br><br>  With the same success, you can study the legislation, download the fish document on the Internet, and process it personally in the desired option. <br><br>  In the Store, an order is executed by a lawyer based on tested solutions.  The document is not developed from scratch, but customized for specific customer requirements.  The choice of document and combination of conditions is shifted from the customer to the specialist. <br><br>  As a result, the client can be sure that he has received a document suitable for his situation. <br><br>  <b>2. The store is not a collection.</b>  Document templates can be found in legal systems.  Basically, these patterns relate to general issues of intellectual property.  For example, a license agreement under a non-exclusive license or the same, but under an exclusive license.  That's all the difference. <br><br>  The high variability of software development and distribution conditions in the available templates is not taken into account.  The client again becomes a choice.  He needs to 1) decide which contract is appropriate for his situation and 2) independently rework it under the conditions of a particular case. <br><br>  As a result, an unsuitable form can be selected or an error is made at the stage of its filling or processing.  For example, in most cases the difference between the contract of the author's order and the contract for the development of software is not seen.  The subject is the same, but the legal consequences are opposite.  Under a contract with a freelancer, the rights to the results of intellectual activity under the law are not transferred to the customer.  Software licensing is even more difficult.  It is essential to describe how to use the software, which is given in the law in its most general form. <br><br>  Choosing the right template is half the battle, you still need to refine it to the desired condition.  Templates for all occasions simply do not exist either in collections or in a law firm. <br><br>  The Store proposes a solution with all the necessary inputs: subject, parties, interaction, result, cost, and settlement procedure, etc.  The client does not need to study dozens of templates and make the right combination of them, for him it will make a professional. <br><br>  <b>3. The store is not an archive.</b>  On the Internet there is a huge number of files with documents for all occasions.  The authors of the documents, as a rule, are not known.  Relevance is not verified.  Conditions apply to a specific case.  Therefore, the need to make an independent choice, as in the designer‚Äôs service, adds the listed disadvantages.  It is necessary to have high competence in the question in order to risk using the document. <br><br>  The Store offers a solution that complies with current legislation and law enforcement practice.  The terms of the document are adapted to the requirements of a specific customer.  The company is responsible for the result. <br><br>  As a result, the client can be rest assured that the document has not lost its relevance and fully fits its situation. <br><br>  <b>4. Store is not a service.</b>  When developing a contract from scratch, it is difficult to estimate the amount of time spent  This circumstance directly affects the price.  The client may also overpay for the processing of the existing contract for another case. <br><br>  Work on the basis of a standardized solution allows you to avoid errors in the assessment and offer the best solution for a lower price.  In this case, the composition of the finished product includes the necessary services for the study of the client's case, the adaptation of documents and advice on their application. <br><br>  It is a pity that many solutions continue to be unique.  However, we will work on replenishing the database of documents for the Store. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/295820/">https://habr.com/ru/post/295820/</a></p>
