  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Google Chrome as an Apple ideas promoter.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A lot of noise recently made the release of the Google Chrome browser. <br>  I read the article <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/google_chrome/39266/">‚ÄúWhat Google really did‚Äù</a> with great interest.  We can agree with almost everything in this article, but I would just like to note that Google is not a pioneer in this matter, but rather a popularizer! <br>  Most of the new ideas for Google Chrome are taken from Apple Safari: <br>  - In 2007, with the release of the iPhone, Apple made an attempt to attract users to use only Web-based applications.  Then Apple announced that only Web applications would work on the iPhone (this was actively discussed in the article <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/web_2_0/16017/">‚ÄúWeb-apps &amp; Apple Safari‚Äù</a> )!  It was a bold move, but after a few months, Apple surrendered under the pressure of developers and most likely large corporate customers, and in October 2007 announced the development of an iPhone SDK.  The release of the iPhone SDK has incredibly expanded the market for iPhone consumers and now the iPhone is already starting to compare with the Sony PSP.  Likely time of full-fledged Web-Apps has not come yet. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  - The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãattracting users to use Web-Apps exclusively has been bothering for a long time and for the last few years Apple has been actively implemented: <br>  "The fact that the wars of computer platforms are left behind, and that now there is only one platform - the Internet, and that only it has a future ..." Steve Jobs was told back in 1996 (see: <a href="http://www.deepapple.com/articles/25290.html">www.deepapple.com/ articles / 25290.html</a> ). <br>  And in 2000, ‚ÄúSteve Jobs, founder and CEO of Apple Computer, made a statement that the company would now not only produce computers and software products, but also develop a wide range of Internet services on its updated website apple.com.  Jobs predicts that the company will enter the top ten most successful Internet companies in the coming years ... "(CNews.ru, 01/06/2000). <br>  - In its ‚Äú.Mac‚Äù service, Apple has been experimenting with Web applications for a long time.  And according to some rumors, web-applications of the updated Apple MobileMe service will constantly expand.  And over time, Apple can create web-based applications - analogues of Apple iWork software and even offer third-party developers to create their own MobileMe applications (see: <a href="http://www.ixbt.com/news/soft/index.shtml%3F10/63/03">www.ixbt.com/news/soft/index.shtml?10/63/03</a> ) <br>  - Apple is involved in the development of tool environments that allow you to create web applications in JavaScript offering to use JavaScript as an alternative to Adobe Flash technology.  For example, Apple participates in the SproutCore JavaScript environment project (see: <a href="http://www.ixbt.com/news/soft/index.shtml%3F10/63/03">www.ixbt.com/news/soft/index.shtml?10/63/03</a> ), as well as people from Apple are developing the Capuccino JavaScript environment (see: <a href="http://www.deepapple.com/articles/25290.html">www.deepapple.com/articles/25290.html</a> ). <br>  - The WebKit engine, best suited for Web-Apps and used as the basis in Google Chrome, is practically a native Apple Safari engine, which has been developed for a long time with the active participation of Apple programmers. <br>  - The idea to use the same full-fledged browser (without circumcision as in MS IE for Mobile) was first implemented by Apple in mid-2007 when Safari for Mac, Safari for Windows, Safari for iPhone came out simultaneously. <br>  - Back in 2008's gray hair (see: <a href="http://www.deepapple.com/news/30983.html">www.deepapple.com/news/30983.html</a> ), it was reported that Apple is already bringing to mind the new 4th version of Safari which will: <br>  1) the function allows you to save web pages as independent applications (see: <a href="http://isafari.ru/news/94">isafari.ru/news/94</a> ) <br>  2) a new JavaScript rendering engine called SquirrelFish (see: <a href="http://www.deepapple.com/news/30911.html">www.deepapple.com/news/30911.html</a> ) <br>  Safari 4.0 should be released in the coming weeks (see: <a href="http://www.deepapple.com/news/31677.html">www.deepapple.com/news/31677.html</a> ) <br><br>  Thus, nothing new was invented in Google Chrome, but only ideas actively promoted by Apple got popularized (pop) for the broad masses of Windows users who are not inclined to love and favor Apple Safari :) <br><br>  PS: And unfortunately, it must be stated that Apple is to some extent to blame for the fact that Google, using Apple's ideas, had to develop its browser and intercept the banner of the On-Line revolution of Web-Apps.  There are several reasons for this: <br>  - Apple could not release perfectly debugged Safari for Windows, which would work as well under Windows as it works under MacOS X; <br>  - Apple did not make a browser for Linux; <br>  - Google could not get Apple to talk about using Safari on other mobile platforms, such as Google Android, for example. <br>  And this closeness of Apple can play again a cruel joke, as once Apple first released a PC (Personal Computer), but could not make it popular (pop), and this was used by a competitor - Microsoft. <br>  Likewise today, Apple first released the iPhone and Safari browser sharpened for Web-Apps, but it seems that it cannot make them pop and a competitor - Google, is actively beginning to use it, releasing its Android platform and Chrome browser sharpened for its Web-Apps! </div>
