I‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs a beautiful city. <br><br>  - I have never been to Russia, so I don‚Äôt even know what to expect from Moscow.  I heard this is a beautiful city and I hope I will have time to see some local beauties. <br><br>  <b>What would you like to see here?</b> <br><br>  - I do not know much about Moscow. <br><br>  ‚ÄúUnfortunately, I don't know much about Moscow, so I don‚Äôt know what to see, but I would like to see some historical places.‚Äù <br><br>  <b>What do you expect from a meeting with Russian developers Ruby?</b> <br><br>  - I have not been a good introduction.  I would like to understand this region. <br><br>  - I have not spoken to the rubists from Russia before, so this will be a good reason for dating.  I would like to know more about the local Ruby scene and, perhaps, to share what is happening in Singapore and what I know about our region. <br><br>  <b>What project / open source are you working on?</b> <br><br>  - Focusing on cloud computing and urbanization.  For an open book where I go.  I'm also looking at writing for iOS applications. <br><br>  - I head the HP corporate laboratory in Singapore, specializing in cloud technology and urbanization.  As for leisure and open source, I just released the book O'Reilly and now I advertise it wherever I appear.  I also take a closer look at RubyMotion - Ruby modifications for creating iOS applications. <br><br>  <b>What do you consider your main achievement in life or career?</b> <br><br>  It is my latest book - ‚ÄúExploring Everyday Things with R and Ruby.‚Äù <br><br>  ‚ÄúI try to make my every new project, whatever it is, be my new major achievement, so at the moment this is my last book‚Äú Exploring Everyday Things with R and Ruby ‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>What do you like to do in your free time from Ruby?</b> <br><br>  - Everything I need to write on mobile apps (RubyMotion). <br><br>  - Now I am writing almost everything in Ruby, from basic scripts to web applications and mobile applications (RubyMotion). <br><br>  <b>When and why did you start programming?</b> <br><br>  - I started programming during the university days.  It wasn‚Äôt any kind of activity.  Programming now. <br><br>  - I started programming quite late, only while studying at the university.  At first, this business did not inspire me too much, but gradually I was captured.  Programming seems to create something where there was nothing before, and this is what attracts me and makes me continue. <br><br>  <b>What would you like to become if you didn't become a programmer?</b> <br><br>  - Probably, say, writing books. <br><br>  - Probably, I would write books. <br><br>  <b>Russia has strong literary traditions.</b>  <b>Have you read any of the Russian writers?</b> <br><br>  For example, it‚Äôs possible to read the textbooks, it‚Äôs probably limited to programming books, science fiction and fantasy. <br><br>  ‚ÄúI think I would like to sometime read Tolstoy‚Äôs War and Peace, but right now my reading circle is limited to books on programming, science fiction and fantasy.‚Äù <br><br>  <b>The conference</b> <br><br>  There are only 3 days left to the conference. <br><br>  You can buy tickets on the event page - <a href="http://railsclub.timepad.ru/event/29192">railsclub.timepad.ru/event/29192</a> <br><br>  Attention, we recommend you to choose payment options with the possibility of quick payment (cards, electronic money).
