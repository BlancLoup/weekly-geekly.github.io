Applicants have big gaps in understanding the roles and responsibilities of the product manager.  Despite their high interest in this position, they are usually unsure of where to start and where to focus.

      Therefore, below I give six areas of knowledge, which, in my opinion, are the most important for the product manager, and relevant sources.  I hope these materials can dispel the fog and point the right way. <br><br>  <b>Translated to <a href="https://alconost.com/ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_campaign%3Dtranslation%26utm_content%3Dpm">Alconost</a></b> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  1. Learn how startups work </h2><br>  The author of the Startup Method book, Eric Rhys, defines a startup as an institution designed to create a new product in conditions of extreme uncertainty. <br><br>  The fundamental tasks and actions of the startup founder and the product manager at an early stage overlap to a large extent.  Both strive to create the product people need, for which it is necessary 1) to launch the product (function), 2) communicate with customers - to understand whether the proposal meets their needs, 3) get feedback from them, 4) repeat the cycle. <br><br>  The product manager must understand how successful startups create products, find their niche in the market, communicate with customers, prioritize potential functions and intentionally do things that don't scale. <br><br>  <b>Resources to help learn startups work methods:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  How to manage a startup and grow your business as fast as possible: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/%25D0%259C%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4-%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B0-%25D0%259F%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5-%25D1%2583%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F-%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D1%2587%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE-ebook/dp/B07GSSMF7H/ref%3Dsr_1_1%3Fkeywords%3D%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%2B%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B0%26qid%3D1564066352%26s%3Dbooks%26sr%3D1-1">Startup Method</a> , by Eric Rice <br></li><li>  <a href="https://playbook.samaltman.com/%3Fsource%3Dpost_page---------------------------">Startup Playbook</a> by Sam Altman. <br></li><li>  Lecture on how to communicate with users: <a href="https://youtu.be/qAws7eXItMk%3Fsource%3Dpost_page---------------------------">How to Run a User Interview?</a>  , Emmett Shear. <br></li><li>  Why regular unscalable activities is the secret sauce of a successful startup: <a href="http://paulgraham.com/ds.html%3Fsource%3Dpost_page---------------------------">Do Things That Don't Scale</a> , Paul Graham. <br></li><li>  Fundamentals of methods for assessing user behavior in a product: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DirjgfW0BIrw%26source%3Dpost_page---------------------------">Startup Metrics for Pirates: AARRR!</a>  , Dave McClure. <br></li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6d6/e75/c71/6d6e75c71945a01b3fea6a30f6835dbe.jpg"><br>  <font color="#0096d6"><i>Photos - <a href="https://unsplash.com/%40mariogogh%3Futm_source%3Dmedium%26utm_medium%3Dreferral%26source%3Dpost_page---------------------------">Mario Gogh</a> , <a href="https://unsplash.com/%3Futm_source%3Dmedium%26utm_medium%3Dreferral%26source%3Dpost_page---------------------------">Unsplash</a> Playground</i></font> <br><br><h2>  2. Understand why flexibility is important. </h2><br>  Product managers typically face tasks without ready-made solutions - and in an uncertain and ever-changing environment.  In such circumstances, to make strict <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall%3Fsource%3Dpost_page---------------------------">long-term plans</a> is a doomed undertaking. <br><br>  The planning and management of the software development process should correspond to such an environment - you need to act quickly and easily adapt to changes, run functions continuously, in small parts.  The advantages of this approach: <br><br><ul><li>  Failed decisions can be noticed earlier - and turn them into a useful experience. <br></li><li>  Achievements motivate people early on and point out the right path. <br></li></ul><br>  It‚Äôs important for product managers to understand why flexibility in planning and work is important. <br><br>  <b>Resources to help you learn a flexible way to develop software:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/%3Fsource%3Dpost_page---------------------------">Agile Manifesto</a> and the <a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html%3Fsource%3Dpost_page---------------------------">corresponding twelve principles</a> . <br></li><li>  Spotify <a href="https://labs.spotify.com/2014/03/27/spotify-engineering-culture-part-1/%3Fsource%3Dpost_page---------------------------">video</a> that inspired many teams around the world (and also helped bypass Apple Music). <br></li><li>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D502ILHjX9EE%26source%3Dpost_page---------------------------">Video</a> on what agile software development is.  Remember that certain rules of ‚Äúflexibility‚Äù do not exist - in each company this principle is applied in its own way (and in different ways even in different teams of the same company). <br></li></ul><br><h2>  3. Improve technical literacy </h2><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúDo I need to get a computer specialty?‚Äù <br>  ‚ÄúDo I need to be able to program?‚Äù <br></blockquote><br>  Above are the two main questions that those who want to do product management are asking me. <br><br>  The answer to these questions is ‚Äúno‚Äù: <b>product managers do not have to be able to program or have a computer specialty</b> (at least in the case of 95% of the jobs on the market). <br><br>  In this case, the product manager must develop its own technical literacy - so that: <br><ul><li>  In general terms, understand the technical limitations and complexity of potential functions without resorting to developers. <br></li><li>  Simplify communication with developers by understanding the basic technical concepts: API, databases, clients, servers, HTTP, product technology stack, etc. <br></li></ul><br>  <b>Resources to help improve technical literacy:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  A course with basic concepts on basic technical concepts: <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/library/topic:digital-literacy%3Fsource%3Dpost_page---------------------------">Digital Literacy</a> , Team Treehouse (there is a free 7-day trial version). <br></li><li>  A course on building blocks of software: <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/%3Fsource%3Dpost_page---------------------------">Algorithms</a> , Khan Academy (free). <br></li><li>  Stripe is known for its <a href="https://stripe.com/docs%3Fsource%3Dpost_page---------------------------">excellent API documentation</a> - by reading it you will get an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow the APIs work.  If any terms are not clear - just google. <br></li></ul><br><h2>  4. Learn to make data-driven decisions </h2><br>  Product managers do not write a real product, but they play an important role in what significantly affects the work of the team - <i>they make decisions</i> . <br><br>  Decisions can be insignificant (increasing the height of the text field), and serious (what should be the characteristics of the prototype of a new product). <br><br>  In my experience, the simplest and most convenient solutions have always been based on the results of data analysis (both qualitative and quantitative).  The data helps to determine the scale of the task, choose from various versions of design elements, make a decision about whether to save or remove a new function, monitor performance and much more. <br><br>  In order to simplify your life and bring greater benefits to the product, it is important to consider fewer opinions (and prejudices) and more facts. <br><br>  <b>Resources to help you learn how to make decisions based on data:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  A course that will give fundamental knowledge on statistics: <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/statistics--st095%3Fsource%3Dpost_page---------------------------">Statistics by SJSU</a> , Udacity (free). <br></li><li>  A course on the basics of extracting useful information from databases and analysis on the fly: <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/tracks/sql-fundamentals%3Fsource%3Dpost_page---------------------------">SQL Fundamentals</a> , Datacamp (there is a free trial version). <br></li><li>  Booking.com is one of the pioneers of A / B testing.  <a href="https://youtu.be/_sx5LV23hIE%3Fsource%3Dpost_page---------------------------">This presentation</a> talks about their approach to testing. <br></li><li>  Airbnb <a href="https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/experiments-at-airbnb-e2db3abf39e7%3Fsource%3Dpost_page---------------------------">Experiment at Airbnb</a> article <a href="https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/experiments-at-airbnb-e2db3abf39e7%3Fsource%3Dpost_page---------------------------">.</a> <br></li><li>  Introducing <a href="https://medium.com/%40ageitgey/machine-learning-is-fun-80ea3ec3c471%3Fsource%3Dpost_page---------------------------">Machine Learning</a> : <a href="https://medium.com/%40ageitgey/machine-learning-is-fun-80ea3ec3c471%3Fsource%3Dpost_page---------------------------">Machine Learning is Fun!</a>  , Adam Geitgey. <br></li></ul><br><h2>  5. Learn to distinguish good design </h2><br>  Product managers and designers work together to ensure the best user experience. <br><br>  The product manager does not need to be engaged in design, but it is necessary to be able to distinguish good design from mediocre and due to this give useful feedback.  It‚Äôs important to be able to go beyond suggestions like ‚Äúmake the logo bigger‚Äù and intervene when things start to get complicated and the design becomes redundant. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/977/c05/0a1/977c050a1d18aee6f629376833d71cfd.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Resources to help you understand what good design is:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  A book on what makes a product convenient and intuitive: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dont-Make-Me-Think-Usability/dp/0321344758%3Fsource%3Dpost_page---------------------------">Don‚Äôt Make Me Think</a> , Steve Krug. <br></li><li>  Check out the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/">Human Interface Guidelines</a> (from Apple, for iOS) and <a href="https://material.io/%3Fsource%3Dpost_page---------------------------">Material Design</a> (from Google, for Android) and try to find the design patterns described there in your applications. <br></li><li>  Lesson <a href="https://www.startupschool.org/videos/57%3Fsource%3Dpost_page---------------------------">Design for Startups</a> , Garry Tan. <br></li></ul><br><h2>  6. Read technical news </h2><br>  Songs, paintings, philosophical concepts ... new is always a combination of existing ideas.  Steve Jobs did not invent a personal computer (the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/xerox-was-actually-first-to-invent-the-pc-they-just-forgot-to-do-anything-with-it-2012-2%3Fsource%3Dpost_page---------------------------">first were actually Xerox experts who simply could not find any use for it</a> ), and Sony did not invent the first digital camera ( <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/06/leading-innovation-through-the-chicanes/%3Fsource%3Dpost_page---------------------------">Kodak did it - which then killed her brainchild</a> ).  Famous companies reworked the existing ones, borrowed, used and adapted ideas already voiced - and this is a natural process of creating a new one. <br><br><blockquote>  To create is to connect many parts together.  If you ask a creative person how he did something, he will feel a little guilty, because in his understanding he did not do anything, but simply saw a picture. <br>  - Steve Jobs <br></blockquote><br>  Product managers need to constantly monitor the latest news, learn about fast-growing startups and failures, be the first to use advanced technologies, and listen to new trends.  Without this, it will not be possible to maintain creative power and an innovative approach. <br><br>  <b>Resources for periodic reading, listening and viewing:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  New products and online trends for every day: <a href="https://producthunt.com/%3Fsource%3Dpost_page---------------------------">ProductHunt</a> and <a href="https://betalist.com/%3Fsource%3Dpost_page---------------------------">BetaList.</a> <br></li><li>  Daily Tech News: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/%3Fsource%3Dpost_page---------------------------">TechCrunch</a> , <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/%3Fsource%3Dpost_page---------------------------">Hacker News,</a> and <a href="https://hackernoon.com/%3Fsource%3Dpost_page---------------------------">Hackernoon</a> . <br></li><li>  Sign up for <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/6ULQ0ewYf5zmsDgBchlkr9%3Fsi%3D0J8Y6gIySECr86iQXggtkg%26source%3Dpost_page---------------------------">This Week In Startups</a> : Jason Calacanis periodically invites entrepreneurs to share their experiences. <br></li><li> Technology Leaders and Authorities on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/paulg%3Fsource%3Dpost_page---------------------------">Paul Graham</a> , <a href="https://twitter.com/destraynor%3Fsource%3Dpost_page---------------------------">Des Traynor</a> , <a href="https://twitter.com/bhorowitz%3Fsource%3Dpost_page---------------------------">Ben Horowitz</a> , <a href="https://twitter.com/cagan%3Fsource%3Dpost_page---------------------------">Marty Cagan</a> , <a href="https://twitter.com/Padday%3Fsource%3Dpost_page---------------------------">Paul Adams</a> , <a href="https://twitter.com/ianmcall%3Fsource%3Dpost_page---------------------------">Ian McAllister.</a> <br></li></ul><br>  <b>About the translator</b> <br><br>  The article was translated by Alconost. <br><br>  Alconost <a href="https://alconost.com/ru/services/game-localization%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_campaign%3Dtranslation%26utm_content%3Dpm">localizes games</a> , <a href="https://alconost.com/ru/services/software-localization%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_campaign%3Dtranslation%26utm_content%3Dpm">applications and sites</a> in 70 languages.
