In total, <a href="https://asi.ru/news/50612/">almost 5,000 children</a> participated in the competition, but less than 100 reached the final. The organizers of the first All-Russian Olympiad of NTI were 3 polytechnic universities: Moscow, St. Petersburg and Tomsk.  Since our studio is based in the building of the Moscow Polytechnic University, we were invited to cover this event on our channel.  We did not think long, collected things and went to the Krasnodar Territory, or rather the All-Russian Children's Center ‚ÄúOrlyonok‚Äù - the dream of any Soviet schoolchild.  Next, under the cut video and photos. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Actually I want to start with the video, which was the purpose of our trip. <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/mC2u5cuGbiA%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjtOM58GXOWmFM7jpbSbpVD7rQb4A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

      Now regarding personal experiences. <br><br>  First, we were pessimistic, because, unfortunately, many educational initiatives in our country are divorced from reality and ineffective.  Olympiad NTI is a pleasant exception to this rule. <br><br>  If before the Olympiad we interviewed some children and when asked about motivation they answered us that they were just interested in trying, then during and after the Olympiad their eyes were already burning and you understand that this week of engineering competitions they will never forget .  As for the organizing staff, as we were settled with them, we witnessed their titanic work, when they returned to the hotel after 23:00 and sat until 5 in the morning and analyzed the feedback, analyzed errors, and at 8 in the morning they already ran to children  We are now engaged in the installation of a vlog, where we will try to show more backstage. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/966/5cf/3b0/9665cf3b0769485bbb6b992e8d7e083d.jpg"><br><br>  The event had drawbacks, for example, the guys complained about the absence of sockets in the rooms of the sleeping building.  But, apparently, Soviet children did not need sockets for phones :) <br><br>  But seriously, as soon as we noticed some flaw, we immediately heard the designation of this flaw from the organizing committee.  For example, one of the ideas in the framework of feedback was that the sets of designers should be made more ‚Äúflexible‚Äù in order for the creative task to be both at the assembly stage and at the programming stage.  Also next year, the organizers want to increase the scale of the event. <br><br>  <i>Test track for unmanned vehicles</i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c67/765/bda/c67765bdaf92494ba6dfdec106843c1c.jpg"><br><br>  What pleased me most was the fact that the heads of educational institutions understood that schools need engineering circles, and not just labor lessons.  We hope this Olympiad will be a small step in a long journey to promote science and technology among those who will build the future in which we will live!  The general partner of the competition was RVC.  Special thanks for the opportunity to attend this event! <br><br>  <i>Layout of the city in the direction of smart power systems</i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bc5/2b1/868/bc52b18683b54c9594d70e11ebf3ff6f.jpg"><br><br>  Do not forget to subscribe to the channel if you want to support us! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/372289/">https://habr.com/ru/post/372289/</a></p>
