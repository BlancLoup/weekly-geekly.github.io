The winners of the previous Championships proved by their example that this is possible. <br><br>  <a href="http://championship.mql5.com/2012/ru/news/148">Registration for the championship this year</a> has already begun, but before it is completed, there is enough time - 3 whole months.  After registration, the participant gets the right to put his trading robot to the competition.  In real-time mode, robots created by participants will trade on dedicated servers for 3 months without the possibility of manual intervention.  The winner will be the participant whose robot will come to the finish line with the maximum amount on the account.  Now tell you what kind of robots, what is the essence of the competition and why it in no case should not be missed.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The Automated Trading Championship 2012 is a competition for robots that trade on the market according to a certain strategy laid down by their developer.  Within three months, such a program will make trade deals, and the more it earns them, the higher will be its place in the final table.  Neither the participants nor the jury of the championship can not interfere with the trading process, and will only be observed from the outside. <br><br>  The prize fund of the competition is quite decent: the winner will receive $ 40,000, the second to come - $ 25,000, and the bronze medalist - $ 15,000. Hopefully, this is a convincing reason to take part in this battle of robots. <br><br>  Are you actively programming in C ++ and other programming languages?  Then you will certainly be able to understand the features of the programming language of MQL5 trading strategies. <br><br>  The MQL5 language unfamiliar to you should not become a serious barrier on this path, since it is based on the C ++ concept, and its syntax is similar to the C ++ syntax.  Thanks to this, it is relatively easy to transfer the code written in one of the modern programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãto MQL5. <br><br>  MQL5 language is applied and designed to automate trading strategies.  MQL5 programs are compiled into executable files that can be run in the client terminal of MetaTrader 5. The main goal of the championship is to popularize the MQL5 programming language and the very idea of ‚Äã‚Äãautomated trading. <br><br>  However, the competition will be interesting not only to the participants, but also to outside observers who are not participating directly in the battle.  Indeed, almost daily on the site will be published news, interviews with the authors of outstanding robots and various reports.  In the profile of each participant in real time will be issued detailed trade statistics on the activities of his robot, in addition, there will be discussions there. <br><br>  In a word, even an ordinary viewer will be able to learn a lot of useful things from the battle taking place before his eyes if he is interested in the topic of automated trading in financial markets, or, more broadly, in the development of artificial intelligence. <br><br>  In recent years, opportunities for automated trading have increased many times, and access to financial markets has opened up to the masses.  There are no disputes over whether a regular trader or a programmer is able to create a profitable automated trading system.  At the same time, an equally important question arises: ‚ÄúWhat knowledge do you need to have to do this?‚Äù And the Automated Trading Championship championships are trying to answer these questions as much as they can. <br><br>  <a href="http://championship.mql5.com/2012/ru/users/index">Register for the Championship</a> , demonstrate your skills and get a solid cash prize, won in a fair fight! <br><br><h4>  Useful links: </h4><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://championship.mql5.com/2012/ru">Official website of the Automated Trading Championship 2012</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://championship.mql5.com/2012/ru/news/147">Detailed article about the ATC 2012 Championship (how, who, where, what)</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://championship.mql5.com/2011/ru/news/141">Opinion winners of the last ATC Championship 2011</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://championship.mql5.com/2012/ru/users/index">Register for the Championship</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://championship.mql5.com/2012/ru/rules">Competition Rules</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.mql5.com/ru/docs/basis">Basics of MQL5</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/146242/">https://habr.com/ru/post/146242/</a></p>
