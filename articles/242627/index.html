    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <i>Perhaps, you have already read many of these books; nevertheless, according to the author, they are quite useful and worthy of attention.</i> <br><br><h2>  A bit about effective communication </h2><br><br><ul><li>  <b>How to develop self-confidence and influence people by speaking in public</b> - Dale Carnegie <br>  Despite the fact that this book was written for a long time and contains many truths, it will be useful to people who at least occasionally have to hold presentations, participate in negotiations, maintain a corporate blog, and just communicate with others.  Good strategies and techniques that will make your story really interesting to listeners, many useful examples and outstanding speeches that you should get to know for the sake of common development. <br><br></li><li>  <b>Communication Psychology</b> - Werderber Rudolph and Caitlin <br>  A good desktop manual, which is suitable for independent work to improve their skills in the field of communication, and to develop a variety of training programs: workshops and trainings. <br><br></li></ul><br><h2>  Note for a startup </h2><br><ul><li>  <b>Startup for $ 100</b> - Chris Gilbo <br>  In my opinion, a fairly watery book, however, there are lots of interesting examples to increase the effectiveness of projects from different areas, useful notes about pricing, adding premium versions, a good explanation of the purpose of the FAQ page and a couple of good hacks (for example, non-standard guarantees return of funds that can significantly increase the project's exhaust) <br><br></li><li>  <b>Startup</b>  <b>Founder Handbook</b> - Steve Blank, Bob Dorf <br>  A detailed guide to turning a small startup into a successful company.  Identification and development of consumers, communication channels, several useful cases and techniques.  In general, a fairly basic book, more suitable for those who have no idea about "with which this porridge is eaten." <br><br></li><li>  <b>The Gamification Revolution:</b> Gabe Zichermann and Joselin Linder <br>  Unfortunately, I did not find this book in Russian (I may have been looking badly).  However, if you speak English, this is a very cool thing about gamification.  Many cases, debriefing, competent use of gamification in various fields of activity.  Written lively and fascinating, a minimum of water, maximum benefit. <br><br></li></ul><br><h2>  Marketing positioning </h2><br><ul><li>  <b>Marketing Wars</b> - Jack Trout and Al Rice <br>  Must read for anyone who is even a little interested in marketing, product promotion and the psychology of consumption.  In my opinion, one of the two basic books that every marketer and start-up must read. <br><br></li><li>  <b>Positioning</b>  <b>Battle of the Minds</b> - Jack Trout and Al Rice <br>  The second basic book that every marketer and start-up must read.  Lots of interesting cases, tips and strategies about the correct positioning of the goods.  About opportunities and threats.  Regardless of what you do, be it a dental clinic or a small mobile application, positioning plays a key role in the development of your business. <br><br></li><li>  <b>Guerrilla marketing.</b>  <b>Welcome to the marketing revolution</b> - Jay Conrad Levinson <br>  A wonderful book about low-cost ways to promote your business.  The book is more focused on the owners of the "physical" business, but it can also give you some interesting ideas on how to create a cheap and effective strategy to attract customers for your startup. <br><br></li><li>  <b>Breakthrough Advertisement</b> - Eugine Schwartz <br>  Another book, which apparently can only be read in English.  An excellent guide to writing a variety of advertising texts, ranging from print ads to well-formed email-subscription and landing page.  Many examples, tips, interesting case studies to increase conversions.  Despite the fact that there are many ‚ÄúRussian‚Äù counterparts, in my opinion, this is one of the best books for people who are involved in copywriting, maintaining startups, and forming advertising messages. <br><br></li><li>  <b>Ogilvy on Advertising</b> - David Ogilvy <br>  A good book from one of the cult personalities in the advertising business.  Good illustrations, good examples of effective advertising, little water. <br><br></li></ul><br><h2>  Motivation, success stories </h2><br><ul><li>  <b>To hell with all, grab and do!</b>  - Richard Branson <br>  A wonderful book from one of the most successful entrepreneurs of our century.  Read in one breath.  A powerful adrenaline rush for beginning businessmen. <br><br></li><li>  <b>Losing Innocence</b> - Richard Branson <br>  Another autobiographical book from Branson, stuffed with lots of motivating stories and some life hacks. <br><br></li><li>  <b>If out of 100 times you are sent 99</b> - Chichvarkin E ... genius <br>  One of the few books from our compatriots, which lures the reader from the front pages.  Chichvarkin‚Äôs somewhat embellished biography, the history of the emergence of Euroset, the vital principles that should guide the building of a successful company. <br><br></li></ul><br><h2>  Some more useful books </h2><br><ul><li>  <b>Supermindings</b> - Tony Buzan <br>  A good book on the application of mind maps in various spheres of life.  Despite the fact that I used most of the tips described in the book before reading on a subconscious level, there are also some very useful and interesting features that will help you in the process of generating new ideas, leading projects, competent note-taking and annotation, and even in planning family life.  It is worth reading selectively, skipping boring places and long explanations of elementary concepts. <br><br></li><li>  <b>Getting Things Done</b> - David Allen <br>  The cult book on increasing personal effectiveness.  It is quite difficult to read, however, the book is full of various life hacks about how to make life easier and learn how to bring things to the end. <br><br></li><li>  <b>The monk who sold his Ferrari.</b>  - Sharma Robin <br>  An interesting cute book about personal development, written in the format of a dialogue-parable.  Despite the rather pop title, is one of the really good books that help you learn to live in harmony with yourself. <br><br></li><li>  <b>The birth of a new idea</b> - Edward de Bono <br>  Unlike a good, but very boring book of this brilliant man ( <b>Six Hats of Thinking</b> (a cool approach to brainstorming, but instead of a huge book I advise you to read a short description of the method)) ‚ÄúBirth of an New Idea‚Äù is quite an interesting tutorial that contains a lot of interesting examples and recommendations for the effective generation of new ideas.  Sorry for the tautology. <br><br></li><li>  <b>Psychology of Influence</b> - Robert Cialdini <br>  Worth reading to everyone.  The book will open the eyes of ordinary people on how they are manipulated by various extortionists of money, ranging from ‚Äúvolunteers‚Äù to collect charity and other sects, ending with retail stores and large retail chains. <br>  At the same time, marketers, business owners of various sizes and just the clever guys can successfully apply the described strategies for their own benefit. <br><br></li><li>  <b>Strength of Habit</b> - Charles Dahigg <br>  Despite the fact that I read it in the English version (Charles Duhigg - The Power of Habit), in theory, it also exists in the Russian version.  On Habr√© was even about her <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/aori/blog/211568/">post</a> .  Just an insanely cool book about how our habits ‚Äúwork‚Äù, how to deal with them.  Well, especially about how to impose them on your consumers / subordinates.  This book will also be useful to a wide circle of readers. <br></li></ul><br><br>  I have everything, but at the same time, I would be so grateful to you for any advice / additions / comments.  And do not forget to share good books. <br><br>  Good luck! <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> Thanks for the add-ons <br><br>  " <b>Motivation. Concentration.

Most often, to make a decision, it is not necessary to know something exactly, some error is always permissible.  The question is how to reduce uncertainty to adequate limits.
