  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Collecting daff</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="http://i.imm.io/pPel.jpeg" align="left">  Tinkoff Bank is expanding interaction with customers on the Internet: the collectors of the organization decided in practice to try new methods of working with debtors.  Now, if you have missed another loan payment, all your friends in social networks will probably find out about it. <br><br>  One of the first to encounter innovation was Veniamin Chebotaryov, a borrower of Tinkoff Credit Systems.  He <a href="http://twitter.com/">reported this</a> on May 15 on his Twitter account with a screenshot of the text sent by the bank‚Äôs employees to all his friends on the Odnoklassniki social network.  Each of them received a personal message similar to the following: <br><br><blockquote>  On suspicion of committing fraud against the bank, as well as in malicious evasion of payables payable, Veniamin Chebotarev is wanted.  The procedure of debt collection has been initiated, and a statement is being prepared to the ATS.  Please provide the debtor's phone number.  Thanks in advance for your assistance. </blockquote><a name="habracut"></a><br>  According <a href="http://www.towave.ru/news/bank-tinkoff-vybivaet-dolgi-cherez-odnoklassnikov.html">to the</a> portal ‚ÄútoWave‚Äù, which was investigating the incident, it turned out that the suspect ‚Äúin fraudulent actions against the bank‚Äù had a monthly payment delay on the card with a credit limit of 15,000 rubles.  Although the debtor did not communicate directly with the bank employees, he picked up the phone in response to the calls made by the informant robot.

      The situation was commented on Facebook by vice president of marketing for TKS Oleg Anisimov: <br><br><blockquote>  Bank collectors explained that they were testing a new form of work with fraudsters.  This client behaved like a typical scammer: activated the card, used the money and missed three monthly payments.  After receiving the notification, the customer has made a payment.  Not only did the client not pay the loan 3 times in a row, he did not respond to any usual notifications in such cases: sms, email, telephone.  Usually this is done by scammers who are not going to pay, and the conversation at collectors with a scammer is short - a statement to the police and a search for all possible contacts. </blockquote><br>  I note that Mr. Anisimov speaks of three delinquencies, while Chebotaryov himself claims that he has delayed the payment only once. <br><br>  Attempts to find out details from Oleg Tinkov, were unsuccessful.  Mr Tinkov replied toWave journalists in a manner peculiar to him: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/212/9cd/491/2129cd491d90f395123bc544791b317b.png"><br><br>  It is obvious that the list of friends who received messages with the borrower's accusations of ‚Äúfraud‚Äù could include people who could perceive the information incorrectly.  Of course, it is also always possible to make a mistake and send messages to friends of another person, with the same name and surname. <br><br>  Among other things, the methods of the bank is also not legitimate.  About this <a href="http://www.firstnews.ru/news/finance/tinkoff-kreditnye-sistemy-podruzhilsya-s-frendami-dolzhnikov/">told the website firstnews.ru</a> lawyer Dmitry Lipatov: <br><br><blockquote>  Such reports can be regarded as defamation, since only law enforcement can only make conclusions about fraud against certain individuals.  If the debtor has delayed one payment to the bank and the Ministry of Internal Affairs is not checking it for it, it is categorically impossible to talk about a search for suspicion of fraud. </blockquote><br>  Despite the dubious actions of collectors and, in general, condemning their publications in the media, one cannot but tell in more detail about Veniamin Chebotarev and about the source of his income.  The fact is that the young man is the "foreman" of the pyramid "MMM-2011".  For further participation in it, he probably took a loan. <br><br>  And here it becomes scary.  If in the first MMM there were mainly pensioners and a poor ‚Äúworking class‚Äù who carried modest pensions and savings there, today young people are going to the ‚Äúfield of miracles, the country of fools‚Äù: students, ‚Äúmiddle managers‚Äù - in a word, all those who want a rich and beautiful life.  And they are not investing the last pennies, but rather large sums taken on credit. <br><br>  Not so long ago, the Internet was widely <a href="http://www.versii.com/news/255489/">discussed the</a> letter "thousand" Artem Prokofiev, where he talked about the lack of money to pay the participants of the pyramid.  And the story of the ‚Äúforeman‚Äù Chebotaryov is a very graphic confirmation of this. <br><br>  The story, of course, is sad and makes you wonder how many loans in Russian banks are taken to participate in the pyramid, and how the domestic economy will survive its decline. <br><br>  I propose to give an assessment of the methods of work of ‚ÄúTKS‚Äù for the recovery of debts to everyone for myself to give independently. <br><br>  <b>Conclusions% username%:</b> <br><br>  - Do not take a loan that you can not repay <br>  - Learn from the mistakes of others: do not participate in the pyramids <br>  <s>- Durov, return the opportunity to hide friends!</s> <br><br>  <b>Upd:</b> <br><br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/144048/">Comment</a> by <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/inturist/" class="user_link">inturist</a> : <br><br><blockquote>  Friends.  I am the head of the online publication toWave and would like to give some information.  We saw a message from Benjamin on Twitter‚Äôs workflow on Twitter‚Äôs news feed.  We contacted and requested a screenshot from "Classmates".  Then they turned for comments to Oleg Tinkov and Oleg Anisimov about the working methods of their collection service.  Received confirmation that they are testing a new method.  And frankly stunned. <br><br>  The bank grossly violates the laws.  But Oleg Anisimov preferred to rest on the fact that Benjamin is associated with MMM.  To which we reasonably noted that when they gave him a card, they were not interested in these subtleties.  They needed a client - they got it.  Oleg modestly kept silent and did not enter the discussion anymore. <br><br>  We were ‚Äúhooked‚Äù by the fact that the bank is breaking the laws and is feeling normal.  Each person can have force majeure or temporary difficulties.  Yes, it does not give the right not to pay for the loan.  But this does not give the right to send spam to friends of the borrower. <br><br>  There are laws, there are standard procedures.  But the bank chose to act in other ways. <br><br>  Well, about the communication methods of the chairman of the board of directors of TCS Tinkov can be judged by the screenshot.  Customer = loshara. </blockquote><br><br>  <sub>Materials used:</sub> <sub><br></sub>  <sub><a href="http://twitter.com/">http://twitter.com/#!/4ebotarev</a></sub> <sub><br></sub>  <sub><a href="http://www.towave.ru/news/bank-tinkoff-vybivaet-dolgi-cherez-odnoklassnikov.html">www.towave.ru/news/bank-tinkoff-vybivaet-dolgi-cherez-odnoklassnikov.html</a></sub> <sub><br></sub>  <sub><a href="http://www.firstnews.ru/news/finance/tinkoff-kreditnye-sistemy-podruzhilsya-s-frendami-dolzhnikov/">www.firstnews.ru/news/finance/tinkoff-kreditnye-sistemy-podruzhilsya-s-frendami-dolzhnikov</a></sub> <sub><br></sub>  <sub><a href="http://www.versii.com/news/255489/">www.versii.com/news/255489</a></sub> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/144048/">https://habr.com/ru/post/144048/</a></p>
