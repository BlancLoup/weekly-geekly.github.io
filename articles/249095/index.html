  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Data Center per billion or "Super Ring" for the "Wild West"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  With each new year, in the world, the need for new data centers is growing more and more and this is understandable.  The widespread availability of broadband Internet, and the emergence of more recently unthinkable technologies of wireless, high-speed data transmission, have increased the volumes of transported traffic over the past five years.  The result of this rampant growth was a situation where multi-billion dollar companies are investing in the creation of new infrastructure substantial funds, thereby further increasing their capital.  Huge volumes of traffic wandering along IT backbones, plus generous financing, which is invested in the development of this industry, create real leviathans - mega data centers. <br><br>  The <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/ua-hosting/blog/227265/">SWITCH</a> company, already familiar to us, has become yet another troublemaker; its management‚Äôs far-reaching plans do not cease to haunt the IT community even now.  Recently, the governor of the US state of Nevada - Brian Sandoval (Brian Sandoval), while staying in the city of Reno, announced plans to create there another data center company SWITCH.  The declared cost of the project is one billion dollars.  The town of Reno, which is located halfway between Las Vegas and San Francisco, will have to become the platform where the announced investments will be mastered and where the next mega-data center will definitely appear. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fdd/400/738/fdd400738bcb4cdeb510139fd3ecca18.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a>

      According to the project, the area of ‚Äã‚Äãbuildings of the erected complex is not less than 280 thousand square meters.  For a better understanding of the scope of the company, we can only say that such a footage of the premises corresponds to the average residential neighborhood with high-rise buildings.  In total, under the created IT complex, the project covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äã400 hectares, currently lifeless, deserted land, where in the very near future, without a doubt, the modern IT garden will stretch. <br><br>  In announcing such impressive plans, the governor of the state, Brian, said: ‚ÄúOur state relies on attracting investments in such projects.  The decision taken by the management of SWITCH to develop its second, in our state, platform in Reno - we warmly welcome, in fact, like similar projects that are actively developing in the city. ‚Äù  Here, the head of state clearly hinted at the 75,000-square-meter data center being intensively built by Apple, near Reno, which should work at full capacity at the beginning of 2016, thereby meeting the ever-increasing needs of customers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/017/e59/b28/017e59b28ea5485ab081cd889a0e6621.jpg"><br><br>  Such a situation for the city is, in fact, extremely extraordinary, because the choice of the leaders of the IT industry fell on the location, it would seem, the least possible way to create such a large IT hub.  The removal of excess heat from operating equipment is a scourge of modern data centers, at the same time in the summer months, the temperature in these places can reach up to +50 C in the shade.  But the additional cost of cooling the premises is only half the trouble, the greatest problem of this area is geology.  Reno is not a lot of many at the fault of the tectonic plates, the North American and the Pacific Ocean which it absorbs.  This unfavorable neighborhood led to the fact that not so long ago, in 2008, an unprecedented case of a series of earthquakes was recorded in the city, which lasted more than two months, daily, two or three times a day, with a gradually increasing magnitude Reached up to 5 points on the Richter scale.  Here you can only add that, according to the technical task, erected by the data center, as well as similar existing complexes, will have to meet the highest level of security developed by the staff of the Uptime Institute, Tier IV Gold. <br><br>  But not everything is so simple with this project.  At first glance, a not-too-thought decision to build a second super data center, just 550 kilometers from an already existing giant, in a semi-desert state with a bunch of attendant risks, turned out to be only part of a puzzle presented by the Nevada governor. <br><br><h4>  Super SWITCH ring </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a6a/0f7/f1d/a6a0f7f1d10c4948809bd39b0c5c5931.jpg"><br><br>  Despite the impressive scale and complexity, the SWITCH company's vision is much more complex and aimed at both the coming years and the medium term, which explains why the company goes on the seemingly not too smart adventure in Reno.  According to the company's development plan, the projected data center should become only a small part of the mega-cluster, which in the not-distant future will combine four similar IT nodes, becoming a significant element in the global IT infrastructure. <br><br>  As mentioned earlier, in the state of Nevada, near Las Vegas, there are already existing SWITCH data centers.  The IT site <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/ua-hosting/blog/227265/">SUPERNAP in Las Vegas</a> consists of three queues, two of which are SUPERNAP 7 and SUPERNAP 8 fully functional, and the third - SUPERNAP 9 at the final stage of readiness.  The total area of ‚Äã‚Äãproduction capacity of the entire complex will be about 135 thousand square meters. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fdc/fc5/055/fdcfc505579740b3a0e3fb1a141899dd.jpg"><br><br>  After the construction of the data center in Reno, these two giants will be connected by a dedicated fiber-optic line, which in turn will create a cluster on the basis of two data centers.  According to the calculations provided by the company, the length of the cable connecting the two sites will be slightly less than 600 km, while the network delay between these two components of the cluster should not exceed 7 ms, which is quite enough for the combined structure to work effectively. <br><br>  ‚ÄúIn the coming years, the duplication of data and the ability to scale the allocated resources of data centers under peak loads in such large sizes will make our company unique not only in the market of hosting services in the USA, but throughout the world,‚Äù said at the presentation Rino representative of the company SWITCH. <br><br>  As you can understand the company's management thinks really globally.  Moreover, according to the general idea, two more nodes will have to enter the emerging mega-cluster, commensurate with the characteristics that are comparable.  Los Angeles and the west coast's IT capital, San Francisco, will become those components that will form the SWITCH Super Ring.  It is not difficult to guess that after the implementation of the conceived competitors, the company in the region simply will not remain, and this region is very tasty for hosting companies in itself, Silicon Valley is still a significant player in the global IT industry. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/965/bba/3ca/965bba3caa6d4e38becb6070bb322fd4.jpg"><br><br>  The company's claims to world leadership are truly ambitious.  It is all the more interesting that they are quite reasonable and technically feasible.  Currently, SWITCH provides hosting services to the largest representatives of the US IT market, including such heavyweights as eBay, Google, Cisco, VMware, Microsoft Xbox One.  Moreover, on the basis of the company's capacity, there are about forty cloud services, which is already talking about thousands of smaller customers who actively use the services provided.  According to preliminary information, the largest of these SWITCH partners are already concluding pre-orders for the planned capacities, thereby guaranteeing the profitability of this mega project at the project stage.  Even now, in such a dynamic market of IT infrastructure as in the USA, the commissioning of new capacities is still a tangible event for its participants.  The implementation of projects of such a scale is a significant event not only for the USA, but also for the entire IT community.  We will look with impatience to the process of formation of the presented project, all the difficulties and victories with which it will certainly face. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/249095/">https://habr.com/ru/post/249095/</a></p>
