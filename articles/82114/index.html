I myself have been very much looking forward to this since the beginning of the year, and now, it seems, everything will soon become clearer. <br>  Once, 2.5 years ago, literally an hour after the start of sales, I wrote the first (?) Russian review of the iPhone, shared my impressions and thoughts.  Since then, my ‚Äúapple‚Äù passion has arisen.  And today, one day before the announcement, I would like to tell my thoughts about what the new gadget will be like and what its purpose will be. <br><br><h4>  Revolution </h4><br>  My favorite <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DASkis57blsc">moment</a> from the presentations of Steve Jobs is when he announces the release of an iPhone, and says that "we reinvented the phone."  Then many laughed at this, but the fact remains that, and after that, other phones began <s>to</s> appear with touchscreens, convenient browsers, and so on. <br><br>  As for this tablet computer ... it will also change the world :) <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8f8/17a/f09/8f817af09a28a17ae947b0cc81f47243.jpg" alt="image">

      Just imagine: let's say 30 years ago, in order to get new knowledge, a person needed to go to a special institution - to a vocational school, university, some kind of courses.  Something small could be found by going to the library.  Although again, you spend more time on the road and searching for the right book. <br>  10-12 years ago it became possible to buy a disc in the direction of interest, on which practically everything needed would be collected. <br>  Now you can go to the computer, open Wikipedia or Yandex / Google and find everything you want, the most relevant, in a matter of seconds.  Of course, on Wikipedia, you will not learn nuclear physics, but we are talking about ordinary people with everyday interests, tasks and questions. <br>  Also, sitting, you can send a letter to the other side of the planet or find out the latest news, see fresh photos of classmates.  But all the same, for this you need to go to the computer, take a mouse in there and look at it so that the arrow on the screen goes where you need it.  This is how the ba does not look very natural.  In fact, the basic principles of modern computers have not changed since the 1980s, when that same ePL released the first computers with a mouse.  All these decades computers have become more powerful, the interfaces are more beautiful, the mice are more comfortable, BUT everything has remained the same: a person sees a picture, moves the mouse over the screen, selects some elements on the screen, and so on. <br><br>  Remember, at the presentation of the iPhone, Jobs said that they say who wants to use the stylus when we naturally have the most convenient control device - our fingers.  So what do we (presumably) give this new tablet?  It can be taken in hand, no matter lying on the couch, sitting at a table or on the way in a train, and reading the new information, like a regular book or newspaper.  It will be possible to poke your ‚Äúnatural‚Äù finger at links on sites and program buttons.  This is where the most important thing happens - the <b>intermediate link in the contact between the person and the computer</b> is <b>excluded!</b>  A completely new stage of evolution, a new level of interactivity, when any sites are felt ‚Äúat your fingertips‚Äù.  Now the button can be simply pressed with a finger, and the page should be turned over with a ‚Äúbrushing‚Äù motion.  The next step can be just a direct connection of a person to a computer, as in the ‚ÄúMatrix‚Äù. <br><br><h4>  Purpose </h4><br>  According to rumors, the company plans to sell 10 million of these devices in the first year.  To achieve this, you need to offer something really interesting and designed for the mass consumer. <br>  And why are computers or laptops commonly used now?  Reading mail, viewing sites, well, photos / videos to watch sometimes.  BOOM!  These people will have the opportunity to take a small device that fits into any bag, and on this device they will be able to get the maximum usability of those very basic functions - surfing the Internet, watching pictures and videos ... and plus, because the device is as big as a magazine, you can and magazines on it to read.  And no longer need to go to the kiosk in order to find the right magazine, and then throw it out.  The appearance of aytyuns encouraged people to buy music files instead of buying CDs.  Now the same can be done with newspapers and magazines - subscribed, got a fresh release right on your device.  Publishers have long been talking about reducing revenues from issuing paper publications - and here again, and you can incredibly reduce the cost of production (no need to print) and the distribution of your products, and revenues can even be increased through better advertising.  Well, there is already a rental video in aytyuns - we went somewhere on a business trip, downloaded a new movie and watch it on the tablet on the train.  But still, how incredibly convenient will be surfing the Internet.  In fact, reading any forum will become as simple and convenient as reading a book. <br><br><h4>  Equipment </h4><br>  Now a little about the technical stuffing and how it might look. <br><img src="http://www.9to5mac.com/files/tablet_1_0_0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I remember recently there was even a rumor that Core2Duo, gigabytes of memory and so on would be inside.  This, of course, is almost impossible - such a tablet will weigh too much and work too little on the battery.  The ARM Cortex A9 based chip, which consumes much less energy than even the intel Atom, can cope with internet surfing, mail, movies, books, documents and music.  It's not just that Apple acquired a stake in the chip maker PASemi. <br><br>  Many more rumors are predicting something like a large iPod / iPhone with the same interface, even spy <a href="http://9to5mac.com/tablet-is-giant-1st-generation-iPhone-3543245">photos of</a> large glass periodically appear.  This also seems to me utter nonsense.  There is no reason for the epl to launch only a ‚Äúgiant iPod‚Äù with a 10 "screen. Is the device just for more convenient reading of books? No, that would be too primitive. Yes, it is clear that in such circumstances the buyer would rather buy Kindle DX on electronic ink. Moreover, it is not enough just to take an iPhone and enlarge the screen 3 times - searching for the icon of the desired program will turn into a torment. Usually, if Apple enters a new market, then they make a revolution, bringing something fundamentally new (this was the case with poppy iPod, with iphone). In the favor of this guess they also say  rumors that Jobs said: "This is the coolest thing I've done in my life." <br><br>  I would bet on: <br><ul><li>  ~ 10 "screen with 1080x resolution ... </li><li>  all wireless interfaces (3G, Wi-Fi 802.11n, Bluetooth 2.1 + EDR) </li><li>  USB </li><li>  camera for video chat </li><li>  ability to connect an external keyboard </li><li>  an interface that is different from both the iPhone and the desktop MacOS </li><li>  optional drawing pen </li><li>  at least 8 hours in movie mode </li><li>  if you can connect a keyboard, an optional stand / dock would be logical </li><li>  weight about 600-800 grams </li><li>  price $ 800-1200 (between iPhone and MacBook) </li></ul><br><br>  This I imagine Apple‚Äôs <a href="">Orange</a> Revolution.  What it will be (and whether) in fact - we will find out tomorrow.  Stay tuned! <br><br>  ps Already 2 years on Habr√© and here at last the first topic, I worry ;-) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/82114/">https://habr.com/ru/post/82114/</a></p>
