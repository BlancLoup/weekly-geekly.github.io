Using JavaFX in real projects</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Long ago, the Greek mathematician and engineer Heron (10-70 AD) invented the automaton, which betrayed a little bit of "holy" water.  After 20 centuries, his invention will be called a big name - the <b>first vending machine</b> , and humanity will persistently try to automate almost everything it uses. <br><br>  Many things have been automated - from the huge production capacity to the sale of goods and services, and people are not going to stop there ... <br><br>  One big area of ‚Äã‚Äãautomation is the <b>automation of business processes</b> , namely the use of various types of terminals and vending kiosks.

      In recent decades, this direction has been developing by leaps and bounds, thousands of projects have been created and implemented.  Among them are quite ambitious ideas, such as <a href="http://www.bikedispenser.com/bikedispenser.html">a bike rental machine</a> and a fully automated parking with efficient car parking to save urban space.  Recently, Habr√© wrote about an <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hi/120025/">automated library in Chicago</a> , and in Frankfurt at the railway station there is a terminal that sells gold bars.  There are quite a lot of ambitious projects, but in the <s>harsh</s> realities of our country the implementation of these projects seems rather vague.  Well, at least in the near future. <br><br>  However, not everything is so sad.  Some types of automation still entrenched in the domestic market. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  A very promising direction in automation is <b>systems with touch screens</b> .  And I do not mean only popular payment terminals, there are many other interesting types and subtypes of such systems. <br><br>  For example, information kiosks.  They can serve to inform almost everywhere.  An example is the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/e_gov/119743/">‚ÄúInfopoint‚Äù</a> mentioned earlier in Habr√© <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/e_gov/119743/">in St. Petersburg</a> , which is an informational solution for tourists and city guests.  And I think similar projects will be actively implemented both on a city scale and in individual enterprises. <br><br>  There are also Internet kiosks, ticket kiosks and even ‚Äúselling‚Äù discounts ... <br><br>  Our company is engaged in just such cases of automation, as well as we are interested in innovative projects in this industry. <br><br>  The development of software for payment terminals - the <b>processing center "Mathis":</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/61177f12/560e0bcb/3a244536/80779e82.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/1ca75d33/ae83df78/cc148907/b00665df.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/832334c7/40aea373/8f20b06d/1435e270.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Presentation software for Hyundai exhibition stand</b> , based on the Avtomatis system: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/e180e996/07caa434/bb1c022f/62125143.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/c31af5e5/236d4ad7/88f041eb/777a434e.png"><br><br>  Together with Avangard, a first-of-its-kind <b>hybrid of a vending machine and the Kofematis payment terminal is</b> being developed <b>:</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/9247c7fc/cae20965/6f83eea3/29bd0a04.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/a33f1693/145d7c44/e18516de/d9aa9ac7.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/f5ad5f3e/3f332bd5/1fdffdb4/e44db5db.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/283a5235/895e106d/2cbc55aa/733f9abf.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/d5ff7d0a/6b1fd0fb/8dae38b2/dec4b076.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/141af1b1/57fa67c7/0eee4061/8ac20faf.png"><br><br>  In Kamyanets-Podilsky, the <b>first in Ukraine automated toilet with our software ‚ÄúWC-vending‚Äù</b> will soon work <b>.</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/3ad8850a/0c429217/f666e875/dcfd36b1.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/6901a59f/64c4e148/5930d994/0d013feb.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/861f4159/f47945f8/21f6571d/6c44eacc.jpg"><br><br><br><br><h4>  JavaFX technology in automating business processes. </h4><br><br>  The user interface in all of our projects listed above is implemented <b>on the JavaFX 1.3.1 platform.</b> <br><br>  Why did you choose young and ambiguous JavaFX? <br><br>  It all started with the development of the payment system and, of course, everything was done on the naked enthusiasm.  It was originally planned to use the Flash technology, but after there were no <s>enthusiasts</s> interested in the normal operation of the flasher, it was decided to look for an alternative platform, and since the system itself was written in Java, our chief technology officer Alexander Mathis offered to try JavaFX.  It was not difficult for him to master this platform, and the integration of the young platform with Java promised the solution of many previously significant problems. <br><br>  Of course, the use of JavaFX has brought with it other important problems that I would like to talk about, but this question is worthy of a separate article (expect on the Habraecranes). <br><br>  JavaFX is a very, very interesting technology.  Our semi-annual experience of implementing it in real working conditions at payment terminals (24 hours a day / 7 days a week) showed that the technology has a number of drawbacks, which are caused by its ‚Äúyouth‚Äù and some dampness, but the huge potential that comes with a <b>bunch of JavaFX Java</b> deserves due attention when developing applications like systems for automating business processes. <br><br>  The developers at Sun promise an active ‚Äústruggle‚Äù with the ailment of the Java line for deploying systems on ordinary users' computers.  This gives JaveFX a chance to enter the web arena in the future.  That is, the future of the creation of the Sun promises to be sunny. <br><br>  With the release of Java FX 2.0 beta, our company is working on the transition of the entire production process to new ‚Äúrails‚Äù.  Indeed, in the second version of the creation of Californian programmers, many new goodies and closer integration with the Java platform appeared. <br><br><h4>  Automate everything! </h4><br>  Automating a business process is an interesting and exciting thing.  We will still acquaint you in more detail with each of our products and with its introduction into the life process of the automated business. <br><br>  On our experience in the vending business, we are convinced that everything can be automated!  The main thing is that this automation would come at the time and the entrepreneurs understood why they were introducing this or that system and the project reached the end, the stage of introduction into the living environment. <br><br>  We will be happy to hear suggestions and ideas about automation Habrasoobschestva.  We will also be happy to answer your questions about the experience on JavaFX in real conditions. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/120915/">https://habr.com/ru/post/120915/</a></p>
