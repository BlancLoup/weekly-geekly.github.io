And this is a story from a small provincial town of the Far East. <br><br>  After graduating from university, I spent a whole year trying to find an adequate job, but nothing came of it.  All jobs were either too uninteresting or outright fraudulent.  Therefore, it was decided to focus on remote work for one of the capital companies, the benefit of knowledge allowed. <br><br>  So, after a month of searching, I found a job with good conditions and began the life of a remote worker.  Naturally, no one in our town was engaged in such a business, except for photographers who, besides their main work at the television station, sold landscapes of the local neighborhoods.

    <h5>  Meet on clothes </h5><br>  And so, after I had been wearing a business suit for a year, working as a manager for local companies, I turned into a remote worker who spends most of his time at home.  Gradually, the style of clothes, habits and manner of behaving from a jaunty boy in a suit, turned into an overweight hamster, who always goes and thinks about himself.  Special color was added by sponsored IT T-shirts, where sometimes they wrote ‚Äúspecific humor‚Äù. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  I live in an ordinary apartment building, and people know me from birth.  And, of course, they constantly compared the success of their children with other people, including me. <br><br>  And it all started with the fact that I began to notice the views of people from the bus stop, when I went for another coffee in the morning to a local cafe.  This slightly contemptible and arrogant look when they are ‚Äúin business‚Äù, and you are a loafer sitting on your neck. <br><br>  And the longer I worked at home, the more arrogant the views of people became.  The purchase of a mountain bike, on which I began to study, added fuel to the fire, in order not to turn from a young and slim to a not very slim one.  He began to hear opinions: ‚ÄúThere is no work, but he is driving around on a bicycle.‚Äù  I was, in general, all the same, but over time even this became annoying. <br><br>  Then one day, when a neighbor from above returned from the parents' meeting, in a fit of anger and assault, he yelled at his son: ‚ÄúYou will study, either you will go to the army, or you will become like that‚Äú zadrot ‚Äùfrom the third floor‚Äù.  And it so happened that this "zadrot" turned out to be me. <br><br><h5>  From "zadrota" in the mafia </h5><br>  Time passed, money was saved, and the opportunity to take the car appeared.  And as soon as people saw the car, they were first stunned that a bummer had bought a car, and then began to say to myself that I was pushing crap on schoolchildren. <br><br>  You ask: "How do I know this?".  Yes, everything is simple.  One 12-year-old boy came up to me and wanted to buy himself some ... To my logical question: ‚ÄúWhy does he think that I have it,‚Äù he replied that his mother says that about me! <br><br>  Therefore, if you work remotely, remember a few rules: <br><br>  1) Find a good profession that you can talk to your neighbors.  Just let it be the simplest and not "you ..." profession: a specialist in the city archive, an engineer in setting up a line of a cardboard mill. <br><br>  2) Carry a bag with you, and preferably a brief case or a diplomat, so that people think that you are an important and busy person. <br><br>  3) Do not wear T-shirts from IT-brands, so that people do not consider you a complete social phobia. <br><br>  4) If someone asks you about work, then say that you are very tired and many things have bothered you.  Let people think you are bad.  So there will be less reason for gossip. <br><br>  5) Do not read all these rules, and the article itself, walk in sneakers and turn into a satisfied IT hamster. <br><br>  All good and positive! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/231901/">https://habr.com/ru/post/231901/</a></p>
