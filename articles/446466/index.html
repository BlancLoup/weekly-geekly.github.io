Every six months, the Habra content studio almost completely leaves the online twilight and tells something interesting in a cozy room.  Yes, and other narrators on this incites.  On March 28, we did this for the sixth time, having gathered an audience of representatives of small and medium-sized businesses. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b93/923/866/b93923866e4fb287ad90f5a4f3a4a985.png"><br><br>  Small companies as much as possible are focused on business development and they have almost no resources left for other areas, if they quickly do not bring tangible effect.  And content marketing, sought-after by big business, remains outside the focus of attention of other companies, where they simply don‚Äôt understand how articles - if they don‚Äôt sell and not SEO - can work for business.

      In this post we will share the most interesting theses from the event and tell about it in general. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  We started with an urgent news: right before the seminar on Habr√©, the millionth user started registering! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a27/d8e/b40/a27d8eb40817f0e915d8fa240cf4663d.png"><br><br>  Smiling in response to applause, our <i>account manager Svetlana Sukhareva</i> shared the results of a study of the Habr audience.  Here are some nice facts: <br><br><ul><li>  62.3% of respondents visit Habr every day. <br></li><li>  Our audience has a lot of interests - there are many investors, eco-enthusiasts, amateur photographers and other interesting people. <br></li><li>  60% of users have over 3 years of experience in IT. <br></li></ul><br>  In addition, Svetlana presented the results of the survey ‚ÄúWhy are you reading Habr?‚Äù And reviewed the results by age of accounts: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e2c/58d/5ec/e2c58d5ec99f9101bcac173b583f855a.png"><br><br>  Then we went to the stories of promotion with the help of materials on Habr√©.  <i>Producer of native projects Ekaterina Gorelova</i> explained why the native on Habr√© does not hurt the eye: <i>‚ÄúOur audience, due to professional features, got used to put everything into algorithms.</i>  <i>Like code.</i>  <i>They are interested in everything that helps to solve problems - both professional and everyday.</i>  <i>A native on Habr√© is most often perceived without a negative when he talks about algorithms and codes - workers and everyday ones.</i>  <i>And of course, it should be interesting bright stories, reliable experience and relevant information</i> . <i>‚Äù</i>  Then Catherine gave several striking examples: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/article/373841/">Tables Tabula Sense</a> .  We collected and tested this table with all its advantages and disadvantages.  As a result, we managed to attract a large audience to the crowdfunding page of the project on Boomstarter. <br></li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/article/410509/">Designers Ugears</a> .  They made an ironic review of the wooden designer as a typical gadget (at that time someone else was trying to ‚Äúkill the iPhone‚Äù).  It turned out quite a lot of sales and readings. <br></li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/article/411987/">Razor scooters</a> .  They took three different scooters, drove into the tail and into the mane, compared.  It turned out a live guide for almost the entire line of the manufacturer.  As a result, more than 1,000 people went to the manufacturer‚Äôs website and clicked ‚ÄúBuy‚Äù. <br></li></ul><br>  After Catherine, invited speakers began the performance.  The first was <i>Sergei Abdulmanov ( <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/milfgard/" class="user_link">milfgard</a> ), the leading blog "Mosigry</i> . <i>"</i>  After telling about his company and its policy in Habr√©, Sergey shared his scheme for creating a post: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a97/409/65a/a9740965a38fecb0bd7ec08befcde440.png"><br><br>  In addition, Sergey developed a universal thematic plan for any company in Habr√©: <br><br><ul><li>  How not to screw up, working with our field (10 typical errors) <br></li><li>  My production <br></li><li>  My work day and details <br></li><li>  Analysis of one of the processes (gyporno) <br></li><li>  Why does this thing work at all? <br></li><li>  What are the shoals in the work, and how we solve them <br></li><li>  What happens in the sphere and where we all go <br></li></ul><br>  After Sergei Abdulmanov, <i>Nikolai Belousov, the CEO of Madrobots.ru, took the stage</i> .  He said that many content formats are being transformed today: texts into multi-formats, including multimedia, longrids - into a story for 15 seconds.  A limited number of sites with traffic - in a fragmented media field with hundreds of opinion leaders. <br><br>  Business development plan Nikolay put in one tweet: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3b6/947/d01/3b6947d01d6ffce5b8f43985b025a2c1.png"><br><br>  <i>Dmitry Voloshin, co-founder of the OTUS educational platform,</i> completed the program of reports.  He talked about creating a personal brand with content.  Here are the basic rules that Dmitry formulated for development: <br><br><ul><li>  Fix topics in which you are an expert; <br></li><li>  Choose a style in which you are organic; <br></li><li>  Determine the size that you can; <br></li><li>  Speak the language of your audience; <br></li><li>  Tell stories and joke; <br></li><li>  Do not condemn or criticize specific people and companies. <br></li></ul><br>  Creating expert content alone is quite tedious and not always fun.  Here is what Dmitry recommends for combating burnout: <br><br><ul><li>  Keep in mind the benefits of brand development. <br></li><li>  Schedule content creation and communication. <br></li><li>  Give yourself the right to deviate from this plan. <br></li><li>  Rest at least a month a year. <br></li><li>  Ban haters. <br></li><li>  Meet the fans. <br></li></ul><br>  The speeches ended and the second interactive part of the habraseminar began.  In it, try a new activity - brainstorm to search for topics of posts.  Previously at the request of the guests filled out questionnaires with questions about your company.  Then we divided all into four teams, each of which was led by a moderator from Habr.  After that, within the team, using the questionnaire, we began to search for topics for each of the participants. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/26c/e78/e72/26ce78e725bb805e9d5f138c75d1a034.png"><br><br>  After an hour, almost everyone had a plan of action: ‚ÄúI will come to work, I will get these guys here with these questions, and we will have cool posts!‚Äù.  Moreover, the ideas for the posts were invented not only by the moderator - all participants quickly grabbed the necessary thinking algorithms and began to help. <br><br>  After the interactive moderators shared their impressions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wh/ha/at/whhaatjh7hglqaspmexvvo3i06c.jpeg" width="200" align="left">  Nikolay Zemlyansky, editor-manager of the Habr content-studio: <i>‚ÄúIn my platoon there were seven fighters from different companies - banks, infobase, email-marketing, HR-automation and not only.</i>  <i>An hour later everyone had a plan of action: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll come to work, I‚Äôll get these guys here with these questions, and we‚Äôll have cool posts!‚Äù And the ideas for these coolest posts were thought up as a result of the whole team - the guys quickly got the idea of and, I hope, they can repeat it themselves. ‚Äù</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mv/if/wg/mvifwgx9zu5lzpbjssbyv9hp50w.jpeg" width="200" align="right">  Ekaterina Gorelova, producer of native projects Habra: <i>‚ÄúAt conferences, there is often a paradoxical story: listeners expect miracles from organizers and speakers in the spirit: teach us successful success and get out of the sleeves of rabbits already.</i>  <i>Orgs expect listeners to actively and uncommonly respond to everything that happens.</i>  <i>Not always and not all expectations coincide.</i>  <i>The fact that this time we decided to juggle everything together turned out to be a very correct scenario.</i>  <i>It was possible to look at the texts, themes and everything that makes up the publications with a fresh, uncomplicated look.</i>  <i>And to understand that success cannot be learned that it is difficult, unpredictable, but productive and interesting to invent in the company very different people from very different companies. ‚Äù</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pv/y8/hc/pvy8hczopf1vjrruh4lbqeibp3e.jpeg" align="left">  Anton Polyakov, head of the Habr content studio: <i>‚ÄúBrainstorming was the culmination of the entire seminar.</i>  <i>By some strange coincidence in my group, instead of newbies, as I expected, very experienced people turned out to be.</i>  <i>And most of the time we discussed completely different issues.</i>  <i>As a result, the hour of the brainstorm passed for me like five minutes!</i>  <i>And I was very pleased to talk with advanced colleagues.</i>  <i>It has already been decided that we will develop this format in the next seminar! ‚Äù</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lt/e9/hp/lte9hplz8kwrt_x8quxhngzvo-a.jpeg" width="200" align="right">  Ivan Zvyagin, editor-in-chief Habra: <i>‚ÄúThe format of brainstorms in companies can be as simple as it‚Äôs complicated.</i>  <i>On the one hand, everyone is comfortable, because everyone knows each other well.</i>  <i>But on the other hand, in the already formed teams, the creation of new ideas and meanings can stall.</i>  <i>All participants roughly know what ideas their colleagues will prefer, who will criticize everything, and who on the contrary will be overly optimistic.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>At the habraseminar we found ourselves in a favorable situation, when the participants were not familiar and did not know what to expect from each other, that is, they were not blinkered.</i>  <i>In an hour and a half, seven people submitted dozens of ideas for posts, and most importantly, they understood that they didn‚Äôt write out, and there were still lots of interesting topics around.</i>  <i>You just need to allow yourself to look wider. ‚Äù</i> <br><br>  Bonus for readers of this post: if you do not know what to write on Habr, which publications will be better and what and in what format will optimally reflect your business, fill in the same form as the seminar participants ( <a href="https://forms.gle/WYMVxYTpnERkMFVcA">here</a> ).  Authors 1 (we are for determination and efficiency), 3, 5, 7 and 11 profiles, we will come up with free several topics for the blog. <br><br>  Our partners helped us organize and conduct the habraseminar. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d6d/e23/55a/d6de2355a56e5431efc16f9359061a66.png"><br>  <i>Yandex.Oblako did a good job on photo souvenirs</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/64b/f91/f38/64bf91f387efe4c78a00feec30ae2784.png"><br>  <i>RuVDS - over the lack of charge in the batteries.</i>  <i>By the way, on April 12, the guys will spend the first launch of the server in the stratosphere, you can take part in the experiment here <a href="https://12.ruvds.com/">12.ruvds.com</a></i> <i><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1fc/d2e/fcf/1fcd2efcf8c6458478b1162c9ce037e3.png"><br></i>  <i>Borjomi worked on the inspiration of content makers</i> <i><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2e4/ab7/16e/2e4ab716ea2e113154c7380a355993e9.png"><br></i>  <i>Dodo Pizza - over hunger</i> <i><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6d4/8c5/5d4/6d48c55d4370e34b9cd0338801771eeb.png"><br></i>  <i>Publishing House ‚ÄúMIF‚Äù and Ahmad Tea Russia - above presents for our speakers and the most active participants of the brainstorm</i> <br><br>  And a few more photos from the seminar: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/92e/005/497/92e00549793d925eb7c29559fb0e37e9.png"><br>  <i>Our new pillows!</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f29/222/d80/f29222d809943fedf50cdfd10cdd47ad.png"><br>  <i>Top view</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/91f/3e4/28c/91f3e428cd8efd1d861c436571e676f7.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c1f/391/63e/c1f39163ef1da6ee80be3bcf544b4334.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/46e/630/a8d/46e630a8d5d6002532b35f3cbab4c1c1.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/04a/0fd/b6c/04a0fdb6c7b2aaff123516cad0ec7ad9.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d25/b24/f4a/d25b24f4ab64a6da476ea9ad376b7ac1.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c53/1d4/62d/c531d462d167c08bd16c78bc2b04d9ce.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2bb/630/811/2bb6308118e2bf8718e9a749faf48148.png"><br><br>  During the seminar, we tried to prove that content marketing helps any business.  They attracted real examples of how all this content activity gives a measurable effect.  And also showed that content marketing can be done without third-party experts - by pumping a personal brand.
