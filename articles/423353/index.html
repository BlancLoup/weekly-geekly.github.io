Video from VKontakte / Mail / OK has not been seen at online cinemas for a long time, however there are so-called ‚ÄúCDN balancers‚Äù, these are video hosting services that give access to their base of films after registration.  We will not call them, but those who have not been in a coma for the last 5 years and, although occasionally still using the Yandex search, may have noticed such players (photo above) that are embedded via the iframe on <a href="https://yandex.ru/video/search%3Ftext%3D%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F%2520%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B2%25D1%258B%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%2520%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F%2520%25D1%2584%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BC%25202018">Yandex.Video pages</a> . <br>  Let's analyze how many there are, how many films / series there are and find out if the Internet Video Association cuts off one hydra head, the rest will cover the users' needs for video content? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Just 8 years ago, <b>VK was</b> an absolute monopolist of <b>online piracy</b> .  There you could download terabytes of video content, from newly released new products to long-forgotten classic movies.  Working with the API and getting video from VC on your site was not a problem, maybe someone remembers that KinoBaz worked just like that - <a href="https://habr.com/post/79739/">WHAT to watch, WHERE to download, WHEN will DVDRip come out?</a>  .  But as time went on, the VC changed its owner and a new course of social development was chosen.  network.  Users began to take away something for which they were actually in this social.  network.  At the beginning of the video, and then partially audio.  Webmasters no longer embed video content into their sites, as for viewing it was necessary to be registered in the VC. <br><br>  Then the huge market for video hosting began to free up.  However, they all had a huge drawback: the content rarely appeared there, it needed to be uploaded by itself, there was no API, no structuredness, etc.  This was all taken into account by ‚ÄúCDN-balancers‚Äù and there were closed sites that already have tens of thousands of loaded content.  Each video file is associated with an ID on Kinopoisk, there is information about quality and voice acting, there is a convenient API for mass adding players to the pages of sites.  And the Runet began to play with completely different colors, namely the way we see it now.

    <h3>  How does Yandex find video content for Yandex.Video? </h3><br>  The Yandex search bot, like Google, supports OpenGraph markup, which is why many sites insert such meta tags, indicating the player: <br> <code>meta property="og:video" content="https://example.com/player/key"</code> <br> <br><h3>  Who earns advertising Azino Three Ax on Yandex.Video? </h3><br>  Each player has a hash key that identifies the user from whose site the video was inserted.  Accordingly, the money for advertising is divided between the "CDN-balancer" and the webmaster, as written in the article Group-IB <blockquote>  ‚ÄúThe average earnings of pirates for 1000 views is $ 3.  Thus, the average monthly income from large pirated sites can reach $ 10,000. " </blockquote><br><h3>  How many online movies and TV shows in free access can now be viewed in RuNet? </h3><br>  In order not to create advertising, we will call players like <b>Player 1</b> , <b>Player 2</b> , etc. <br>  In total, there are 5 private video hosting sites in runet now, this is how their players look like <a href="https://yandex.ru/video/search%3Ftext%3D%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%2520%25D1%258F%2520%25D0%25B2%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%2520%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D1%2588%25D1%2583%2520%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D1%2583">on Yandex.Video pages</a> : <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_b/ai/tu/_baitu2lfnt_jucujhz5g5fqbhk.png"><br><br>  Having analyzed all of their <b>APIs</b> , we managed to get the number of video content that is available to them.  And so, at the moment there are <b>36,673 online movies / TV shows</b> in runet, we‚Äôll draw a graph that shows how many video hosting sites have videos: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zp/bg/0o/zpbg0osblvyci-egcqxmyg7ansa.png"><br><br>  Quite a large spread and it is impossible to identify a clear leader.  However, this is not important, as it was already written above, let's find out what happens if one of the heads of the hydra is cut off, how much others can satisfy the video market. <br><br>  If Player 1 disappears, the rest will not be able to cover <b>850</b> movies / TV shows. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/p0/3f/21/p03f21k0hzdydffqmf-xom83qfa.png"><br>  If Player 2 disappears, the rest will not be able to cover <b>1,863</b> films / series. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/y0/ua/2w/y0ua2wl325eeujhm2hsm2cm2q04.png"><br>  If Player 3 disappears, the rest will not be able to cover <b>873</b> movies / TV shows. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mk/tn/sy/mktnsyml69wwpqgjkmdb48asa1a.png"><br>  If Player 4 disappears, the rest will not be able to cover <b>13</b> films / series. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/22/h3/v2/22h3v2exjzxqurovkdwqm5jikw4.png"><br>  If Player 5 disappears, the rest will not be able to cover <b>6</b> films / series. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zo/05/vn/zo05vnguti_26ozrlwakzgtbugg.png"><br><br>  Thus, it turns out that video hosting with the smallest number of films numbered 2 has the largest number of video content units unique to Runet. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xi/mn/rh/ximnrhkdqm6bn9pqixmkv9jcpyk.png"><br><br>  But in general, the situation is such that no matter how much video hosting goes into oblivion, the rest will almost always fill it with 95-100% <br>  With the current state of affairs, it is even unknown how legal cinemas drag this blanket over to their side. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/423353/">https://habr.com/ru/post/423353/</a></p>
