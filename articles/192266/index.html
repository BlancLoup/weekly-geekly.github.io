  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Perfect migration using Catch-> Evernote</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><blockquote>  Remember, grieve. </blockquote>  <i>Today we are the first day without Catch.com.</i> <br><br><h4>  You can not do it this way </h4><br>  Ask a regular user or IT professional about the most annoying cloud installations.  The list of answer options will include data migration from deceased services.  Even if Google, with its unlimited resources, has more than once lit up in an overly zealous optimization of forces and means, what can we say about others.  There is no need to remind what this means for mere mortals - from the loss of time to the impossibility of lossless transfer.  The more pleasant to talk about exceptions. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The issue of transferring information from Catch to Evernote was aroused by the author of the post in the spring, apparently at the level of foreboding.  Unfortunately, it immediately became clear that with the existing migration mechanisms all images, attachments and tags will be lost - only text will be transferred.  Considering that the essence of such systems is the storage of information in all possible types and formats, the idea lost its meaning and had to postpone everything until the <s>worst of</s> best times. <br>  When Catch posed the question with an edge, he had to come back to it again. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

      By the time of the notification of his death, Catch had finally improved his exports (and thanks for that), who had worked somehow and through time.  But the import options in Evernote remained a bit - download the export archive from Catch.com, install the Evernote desktop, unpack the archive (at the same time detecting that notes with the Russian header in Windows are not unpacked to disk), after which we import the enex files into Evernote.  Result: either we end up with lost attachments and tags, or invent crutches, or get a bunch of handmade work. <br>  Habr already dazzled with branches of discussions of alternatives, but there were no visible variants of escape to the main competitor Catch. <br><br><h4>  How to </h4><br>  During the smoking forum, I managed to stumble upon a <a href="http://discussion.evernote.com/topic/23504-import-catch-notes-data-to-evernote/">discussion.evernote.com</a> branch, where some davious just a few days before had laid out a <a href="https://github.com/davious/CatchToEvernote">full-fledged import script</a> on python.  Acting in beta tester mode is not always pleasant, but as it turned out, not today. <br><br>  Rate yourself all the beauty of this is not afraid to say a small piece.  In any case, I don‚Äôt remember when the last time I came across something similar with regard to migration: <br><ul><li>  unpack the archive Catch is not required (!), the script gets into it itself; </li><li>  all notes are correctly imported, including Russian - verified; </li><li>  all tags are correctly imported - checked; </li><li>  all attachments and images are imported correctly - the only glitch is that the rotation of the images stops working, apparently some flaws with exif-tags; </li><li>  during the import, a detailed progress of the process is displayed on the command line (which is important, since the process takes up to several hours for large notebooks); </li><li>  breakage of the connection and restarting are processed normally, no duplicates occur; </li><li>  The documentation for the script is quite detailed, although it has several default settings. </li></ul><br>  Finally, it all works not through some crutches, but with the help of the developer token from Evernote. <br><br>  The export-import process has never been so pleasant. <br>  <b>Export results: Completed 'Main' Notebook upload: uploaded 639 notes, 351 attachments, 727 tags</b> . <br><br>  Did you manage to download the export file Catch.com, but have not yet decided where to apply it?  Hope this helps you. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/192266/">https://habr.com/ru/post/192266/</a></p>
