Sorry for any errors.  Inspired by <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/arbeit/52321/">this</a> post <br>  Baseline data are: Ukraine, remote work with a foreign customer, website development. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h5>  Registration </h5><br>  As it turned out, it was completely unreliable to get formalized as FL-P (an individual entrepreneur, previously called an emergency ‚Äî privately owned entrepreneur).  It is worth starting with the local district administration.  There are all their phones on the Internet, from the 3rd attempt I phoned to the right place - there is a special department under the administrations of the districts that do this. <br><br>  Packages of documents everywhere are ordinary, carry a few copies of your passport and identification code.  It is advisable to have a certain amount of money with you, some services are paid, it is convenient to pay them immediately.

      In this management, it is necessary (or better in advance according to the KVED) to choose a list of the activities that you will be engaged in.  I have chosen 3 types of activities: <br><ul><li>  72.22.0 web development </li><li>  72.10.0 advice on information issues </li><li>  72.21.0 software development </li></ul><br><br>  After filling in the necessary documents (everything is in place) they are asked to come in time, about 3 days. <br>  Issue a <b>certificate about the State Registration of an individual entrepreneur</b> .  This is doc number 1, in the file and in the daddy. <br>  We go to the local tax, there are special consulting departments.  We write an application, fill out forms, buy <b>the Income Accounting Book (form 10 if I'm not mistaken)</b> .  It needs to be numbered on a hundred pages, signed, carefully glued a piece of paper, given to the signature ... It's morose, but in principle, everything is explained everywhere.  It is desirable to have the first tax hikes in the backpack scissors, glue, A4 sheets, files, pens, money.  If you find a procedure on the Internet, you can print out the necessary forms for yourself - there is a long line at the tax office in a local shop.  After a few days, we receive a <b>certificate about the single tax fee</b> (doc No. 2, in the file and daddy, <b>surely</b> xerim).  We get acquainted with the inspector, ask a bunch of stupid questions, write down her work phone.  Yes, you will be asked to pay the full flat tax for the current month.  This is 200 UAH.  And as expected, for the next - this is another 200 UAH.  For the next - everything is correct, but for the current, in my opinion, divorce, but did not understand.  Payment receipt first (and better all) immediately to the copier.  It will be necessary then for the Pension Fund, and the first receipt is taken by the inspector and glued into the case. <br>  We go again to where we received the Certificate of registration, there is a section of the Pension Fund.  We write the application and in a couple of days we get the <b>certificate of registration with the Pension Fund</b> (pysch it in the same daddy). <br>  The certificate is changed once a year, and earlier than it is required for the Pension, therefore, xerim necessarily. <br><br><h5>  Making online reporting </h5><br>  It depends on your place of residence, income and laziness.  From the 1st to the 5th of April, July, October or January you can just go to the tax office and look at the queues.  If not very large, skip this step.  I live in Poznyaky in Kiev, it is quite crowded here.  Just a couple of hours means losing the receipt of electronic keys, special programs and instructions.  It costs about 70 UAH one time, i.e.  for the keys.  If you pissed a flash drive - buy more.  How to report shortly tell you later. <br>  Also find out (I haven't done it to myself yet, I think) about Internet reporting in Pension.  This will have to be done once a year, and if you do not delay it, you can do it without queues.  I delayed - lost 2 am on it.  Well, that is, you can and do - you can and do not. <br><br><h5>  Single tax </h5><br>  So, you, as a single tax payer, have to pay a single tax of 200 UAH for the next month before the 20th of each month.  NEVER pay more for your activities (I certainly mean the state in terms of taxes).  To be a companion should not exceed the allowable annual income - it seems to be 500 000 UAH (although I can make a mistake, surely specify).  Of course, you can pay on receipts - put money in the tax office, but better through the Internet Bank (see below) <br><br><h5>  Pension Fund </h5><br>  The pension fund concerns us a little, but it does.  There are long-standing disputes and the courts about the single-payer and the Pension Fund - still can not determine whether enough deducted or not.  There is a complicated situation, 33.8% is deducted from the EN rate to the PFC.  But since  it is lower than something there, some rate is 42% - and if you do not pay this difference, then the experience is not credited in full, but somewhere 70-80%.  In some PF strongly require, somewhere they offer just to pay once a year this difference.  You decide.  I decided for myself that I wouldn‚Äôt be enough for retirement anyway, then what‚Äôs the point then I save my experience on it.  And not the fact that I will receive it in this state.  And why become an entrepreneur, if you hope for a pension?  In general, the question is more ethical, I bastard, do not pay extra in PFC and because of people like me, retirees get little money. <br>  So, I do not pay extra.  Once a year I need to report to the PFC, submit some form INDANI_SPD.  It‚Äôs easy to fill out, if I don‚Äôt forget - I‚Äôll put links to the forum where it‚Äôs detailed.  Have with you ALL payment of the single tax for the last year and last year‚Äôs certificate of payment of the single tax (copy) <br><br><h5>  Reporting </h5><br>  Every 1-5 day of the month, following the end of the quarter, it is necessary to submit reports on income and tax paid to the tax (at the beginning of the year a report for the last year is submitted). <br>  All this is quite easy to do via the Internet, with the help of a special program.  The main thing is to set it up correctly, for this BEFORE this reporting, by agreement with the tax officer, you can submit empty reports to check the entire process.  By the time it takes about 10 minutes. Well, plus the time to calculate the profit for the quarter (smiley with dark glasses) <br>  Every March 1-31 it is necessary to submit reports to the Pension Fund - INDAN. <br><br><h5>  Bank </h5><br>  Immediately after opening your business, you must open a bank account.  The choice is yours, there are different procedures everywhere. <br>  I chose a SMALL bank, it was important to me that it was close to home, the availability of Internet banking.  Tariffs, too, look at the banks. <br>  I have Ukrainian Professional Bank.  There I spent a few days while I designed everything, because  2 girls worked in the department, who had little idea about accounts for legal entities.  Yes, yes, for the bank you are a legal entity, although FL-P. <br>  In large banks it is possible to open everything much faster, but then there will not be so much individual attention.  For example, I was allowed to bring documents after operations, received applications by telephone, a diary was presented for the New Year :) <br>  To the bank you need: <br>  - bring ALL documents, make copies of several each document. <br>  - do not forget to say that you will receive currency, i.e.  you need a multi-currency account.  I first opened the usual, and then currency.  Yes, sucker, paid 100 UAH more. <br>  -sign one million and one piece of paper <br>  -register your Internet banking and save yourself from going there often. <br><br>  If you have different customers and the amounts and amounts in foreign currency - you will need to bring the contract (contract) for each payment and leave a copy.  I am writing this all to get the currency, I have not received the hryvnia yet by bank transfer, they say it is easier. <br>  I have one amount every month (it was decided so with the customer, it looks like a salary) - therefore, they don‚Äôt demand that I carry the contract every time, but they credit the money like that.  I took the contract once, I work on it a year soon.  Although this may be due to a trust relationship with the bank. <br>  Also you open yourself a corporate card account, get a card.  With this card or through the cashier you can withdraw your money. <br>  In Ukraine, it is not allowed to withdraw cash, if it is not for the needs of international travel. <br>  Here in some useful forum I also discussed this question <a href="http://ua-businessclub.org/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D996%26hl%3D">ua-businessclub.org/index.php?showtopic=996&amp;hl=</a> <br>  Money must first be changed to the native currency, and only then withdraw. <br>  I do not need to go to the tax department in the department of foreign economic activity, I learned it specifically in the tax department.  The only thing is to make sure that between the billed invoice (or the term of payment under the contract) and the receipt of money on the account more than 180 days have not passed, otherwise the difficulties begin with tax. <br><br><h5>  The way of money </h5><br>  Money in euros from the bank of your customer is transferred via SWIFT system to Ukraine, then to your bank, to the currency operations department. <br>  They check everything, require or do not require a contract with you (and acts of work).  If everything is OK, the currency will be credited to your multi-currency account. <br>  Through Internet banking you see the arrival of money and make an application for exchange.  In connection with the finality of some laws, organizations and institutions, you must first submit an application to the bank before 11 am specifying the exchange rate.  By 16 o'clock the bank finishes trading on the interbank market and tells you which course you need to rewrite the application.  Those.  depending on the trades during the day, the rate changes and it does not coincide with your bid.  You rework the application, and the hryvnia is put on your account.  It's true, it's officially everything, no shit. <br>  From the current account you can pay hryvnia for the needs of your enterprise (hosting, Internet, domains, I don‚Äôt know how to use the equipment, but, in theory, it is also possible by bank transfer - this is your workplace) or make an application for replenishment of a corporate card account.  Well, everything is faster, depending on the bank, the money will go to the card from a couple of hours to a day.  Well, there - an ATM, portmone, terminals ... <br><br><h5>  From customer </h5><br>  From the customer you need a contract (and translate it side by side in a column or individual pages) indicating the amount.  Or there it will be indicated that the amount is paid according to the invoice, that is, the invoice. <br>  Every month my customer sends me a SOW (statement of works).  I always thought that this was in our Report of Completed Works, and they say that this is a request for an invoice.  Well, sort of, the same thing.  According to what is written there, I draw an invoice, sign and send a scan to the customer, and soon the currency comes to me.  Depending on the customer, it is often necessary or not to give the original invoices.  I have it once a year. <br><br>  <b><u>TOTAL</u></b> , besides the work of the main need: <br><ul><li>  get <b>formalized</b> (running around somewhere for a week or two, money - 2 single tax single at once, several state fees, payment for electronic keys, bank accounts - all about 500-600 UAH); </li><li>  <b>quarterly report tax</b> (via the Internet from 1 to 5 of January, April, July, October); </li><li>  <b>once a year to report to the Pension Fund</b> (possibly via the Internet, from 1-31 March); </li><li>  <b>pay UAH 200 of a single tax before the 20th day of each month</b> (appointment - for the next month); </li><li>  <b>keep a book of income accounting</b> (optional, no one checks it, but this is your only accounting, useful); </li><li>  <b>make photocopies of ALL documents that fall into your hands, including payment of a single tax, and others</b> ; </li><li>  <b>submit to the bank copies of contracts, if the amount of income changes</b> (here you have to go, feet); </li><li>  <b>PROFIT</b> </li></ul><br><br>  UPD. <br>  Link to similar material on a friendly site, there is just about foreign trade <br>  <a href="http://www.developers.org.ua/archives/max/2009/04/06/ved-for-programmers/">http://www.developers.org.ua/archives/max/2009/04/06/ved-for-programmers/</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/57389/">https://habr.com/ru/post/57389/</a></p>
