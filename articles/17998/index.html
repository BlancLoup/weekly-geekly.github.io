The first word that came to mind was the struggle with what a considerable part of the time was given: <strong>finally answer, friends, who owns the devices, or do they own us?</strong>  One way or another - the technology is getting higher and higher - there are no less bugs <br>  In recent years, engineers and futurologists have often hinted that the integration of various electronic devices into the human body is inevitable, and at the present time we are at the stage of origin of the culture of high-tech <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2598%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D1%258B">implants</a> .  Among other things, this is indicated by various media and technological phenomena: advertising, the work of unknown authors (see figure below), and lonely enthusiasts. <br>  However, at this stage of technology development, one obvious obstacle stands in the way of bringing the machine and man closer: the extreme instability of the work of modern electronic devices. <br>  In 2007, a dozen gadgets passed through my hands.  Each of them could boast of his inherent bugs. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <strong>iPod</strong> - from time to time came across some known obstacles in the tracks and rebooted (about ten times a year). <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/umpc/12519.html">Nokia N800</a></strong> (Linux Maemo platform) - hung up 2-3 times and once destroyed the newly taken photos on the new SD card.

You can talk about this wonderful device (as well as the entire line of devices on Windows Mobile) for a long time and colorfully, if you are interested, contact us.  Generally, it remains to add that now I treat Windows Mobile with unusual trepidation and piety, as usual they treat naughty children at the wrong time, not worrying at the next hang, calmly and regularly drowning the stylus in Reset and not burdening the frail body of the system with a large amount of software. <br><br>  By the end of the year, bugs decided to put a bullet.  When playing video, <strong>Archos 704</strong> purchased on demand from time to time broke into a white screen, refused to work in Ad-Hoc mode and demanded to buy plug-ins for working with all formats for 20 euros (the latter, however, is the manufacturer‚Äôs limitations, but by the user, that is, by me , it is perceived solely as a bug: why make a garden, money is paid for the device!). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/d30/a0a/2b0/d30a0a2b01429e9db0436409baf69e0a.jpg" width="274" height="206" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">  And even a trifling <strong>Belkin fm-adapter</strong> (at an unbeatable price of 1653 rubles) for the iPod was distinguished by its rare sensitivity to broadcasting and, along with the music, transmitted the hiss of different loudness.  In addition, when the device was lightly grabbed, the device constantly fell out of the iPod, not wanting to comply with the reputation of MAC-based devices as reliable and confirming its eastern origin.  Assuming, however, that the elegant design and the shiny rear panel of the adapter overshadow all its flaws, we had to say goodbye to the device without regret. <br><br>  The disappointment of the low behavior of advanced high-tech representatives reached such limits that at the end of the year there was a desire to somehow respond to all these software-hardware joys and start a ‚ÄúBugs‚Äù blog, in which to put video sketches of unsuccessful communication with gadgets.  Here, for example, what pleased Archos: <br><br>  <font>YouTube, 14 seconds, 490 kilobytes:</font> <iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/XaG-9CQmgJ0%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhhduryP2DWMXcwccCQwpaJABYx-ig" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Of course, it can be assumed that I simply have no luck with the devices, or rather, that I am too demanding hardcore-user, but the fact, nevertheless, is worth recognizing - it is still early to get under the skin of modern gadgets: otherwise it will hurt physically.  Monitor blogs and forums can be understood that the best way to communicate with modern high-tech devices is patience and humility - in case you don‚Äôt manage to change, you have to get used to it, wait for a new firmware and be glad that at least that‚Äôs what it is. <br>  So, the presence of a placer of errors has become so normal for modern electronic devices, that for me personally, 2007 will be remembered as the year of bugs and iron imperfections.  In this regard, I would like to wish the stability of the work of all high-tech devices in the new, 2008.  Hope though weak (manufacturers in a furious rhythm of competition shoot confetti of new models of devices, while forgetting about the mistakes of the old ones), but not fading away.  To create a perfect mobile device, Google in 2007 decided to call for help from developers from around the world.
