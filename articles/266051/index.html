Today we are publishing an interview with <b>Timofey Tsvetkov</b> . <br><br>  Timofey graduated from the Faculty of Computational Mathematics and Cybernetics of Moscow State University.  In October 2009, became one of the first employees of Evil Martians.  In 2012, he left Martians and, together with a partner, launched his project: online training and data analysis in poker.  Unfortunately, the company did not reach its financial goals and was closed in 2015.  In March, Timofey joined the <a href="http://www.toptal.com/">Toptal</a> Core Team and now works in the analytics department.

      Timofey is one of the founders and tmlid of the non-commercial project Web-observer, in 2012 received the The BOBS award from Deutsche Welle in the nomination The best use of technology for the benefit of society. <br><br>  Does not drink coffee, loves tea and bow ties. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/98b/ac7/187/98bac7187a4f300c0738aec65cbdc20a.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>How did you get into Ruby development?</b> <br><br>  I was thinking of going to work at Sports.ru.  It was some year like 2007, probably, at least it was before graduating from the University.  In sports.ru I was offered to choose a poppy and write in PHP.  And absolutely free from work on Friday night, I drank whiskey in my favorite bar and with restrained optimism looked at the sporting php future.  My good friend found me behind this occupation and, having learned about my state of affairs, suggested that I go to him and consider his working proposal.  I agreed.  The proposal consisted of mandatory LSD sharing and viewing The Wall as an interview and following up with Ruby on Rails code.  So with Ruby on Rails, I have the pleasant associations of horror, pain, and despair that I experienced while watching The Wall. <br><br><br>  <b>What are you working on right now?</b> <br><br>  I work in the <a href="http://www.toptal.com/">Toptal</a> analytics <a href="http://www.toptal.com/">team</a> .  We write code in Ruby, Scala, R, Python, monitor the company's business processes, develop new KPIs, predict revenues, classify leads, so that sales will react faster to priority leads and not waste time on any kind of garbage.  In general, we consider different numbers, in the hope that they will help optimize processes and increase company revenues. <br><br><br>  <b>In your opinion, in what direction will Ruby and Ruby on Rails develop in the coming years?</b> <br><br>  In the same.  Literally. <br><br><br>  <b>What, in your opinion, is the most important problem that the Ruby and Ruby on Rails developers community is facing now?</b> <br><br>  A lot of gems.  Less to write your gems, more contribut to others. <br><br><br>  <b>Favorite programming language after Ruby, why him?</b> <br><br>  Python.  The question is about feelings, and not about practice, because for different types of tasks your favorite languages ‚Äã‚Äãare different.  I started using Python in 11th grade.  Many pleasant memories are associated with it, plus there are libraries like pandas and scikit-learn under the python. <br><br><br>  <b>Favorite resources (blogs / sites / twitter) on web development and programming?</b> <br><br>  Complex issue.  Probably mailing publishers, sometimes there are cool books, so even at a discount. <br><br><br>  <b>What advice would you give to developers who want to achieve great success?</b> <br><br>  Do not skip algebra and mat.  stat, learn everything related to Data Mining and Machine Learning. <br><br><br>  <b>Who wanted to be in childhood?</b> <br><br>  Looking in what.  For quite a while as a little boy back in the USSR, I thought about a career as a pathologist, while at the same time dreaming about a career as a successful businessman.  The class at 7-8 wanted to become a programmer and never left it again. <br><br><br>  <b>Not tired of programming?</b> <br><br>  No, I'm fine so far. <br><br><br>  <b>What would you do if you had 2 months of free paid time?</b> <br><br>  First, reading books.  According to statistics, it is necessary to update and improve knowledge, for example.  But most of the time would be given to practical classes on the organization of rest with a good psychoanalyst.  I am still very shy to take a vacation, and in general I feel that there is a problem in this area. <br><br><br>  <b>Thanks for the interview and see you in Moscow!</b> <br><br>  At the conference, Timofey will give a presentation on lambda and kappa architecture in ROR. <br><br>  Today, data is one of the most valuable resources, and competent data analysis plays a key role in the success of a project.  It doesn‚Äôt matter whether you use machine learning algorithms to build a smarter and more user-friendly application, or build financial or stock market reports for stakeholders.  You need to perform transformations and calculations on the data.  Such applications can be designed in the classic RoR-style.  And lambda and kappa architecture are patterns for building applications that process data. <br><br>  Toptal is a constantly growing company, the goal in 2015 is revenue of $ 100M.  To achieve this goal you need to constantly improve the processes, KPI and of course, the application.  Search for pitfalls and growth points by continuously monitoring processes and analyzing data.  In the report, Timofey will explain the basic principles of lambda and kappa architecture and their implementation in Ruby on Rails using the example of the Toptal analytical team. <br><br>  Registration <b><a href="http://railsclub.ru/">on the conference website</a></b> .
