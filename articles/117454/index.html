      On the first day of the conference brought the announcements of such new technologies as: Internet Explorer 10, ASP.NET MVC3 Tools Update, Orchard CMS 1.1, Windows Azure update.  More information about what was presented on the first day can be found in <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/vyunev/archive/2011/04/13/microsoft-mix-11.aspx" rel="nofollow">this article</a> . <br><br>  The second day of MIX'11 brought us interesting news on the following products and technologies: <ul><li>  Windows Phone OS 7.5 platform update and new features: SQL storage, access to sensors, support for sockets, and more; </li><li>  Skype, Spotify and Angry Birds on Windows Phone; </li><li>  Windows Phone developer tools with gyroscope, GPS and other sensor emulators; </li><li>  released a new version of Silverlight 5 Beta with numerous innovations; </li><li>  Announcement and demonstration of the package for developers Kinect for Windows SDK. </li></ul>  Below are the details on these topics. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><h4>  Windows Phone OS 7.5 </h4><h4><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5db/e33/e81/5dbe33e81a18d4f1f1c777329573d3a2.png" alt="image" title="image"></h4>  The plenary report of the second day of the MIX'11 conference was opened by Joe Belfiore (vice president of Microsoft) with a story about what great innovations are awaiting the Windows Phone platform already this autumn in 2011.  The report began with a demonstration of an amateur video clip created by a platform enthusiast.  Microsoft has posted a video on YouTube and if it has 200,000 views, its creator will be invited to create commercial advertising material for Windows Phone.  Support the platform and watch the video - it is excellent and worth it. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/8Xm-_gbmcM4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjmtlcytH11XDo-N7xVE-06vLPfiw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h5>  Windows Phone Development </h5>  Joe Belfiori told about the company's plans for the development of Windows Phone.  Marco Argenti, head of development at Nokia, helped him with this. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/314/a39/f26/314a39f2633ed05c7947f99e7dd4cda7.png" alt="image" title="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/478/031/611/47803161188b7376ffdbbdc472066392.png" alt="image" title="image"><br><br>  It has officially announced the support for an additional 16 languages ‚Äã‚Äãin Windows Phone 7, including the Russian language.  Creating applications and placing them in the Windows Phone Marketplace application store will become available for eight more countries (in Russia it was available from day one). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/033/ec4/602/033ec4602f53badb1059a6405544625f.png" alt="image" title="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/653/841/d33/653841d33132ba01042d93ddbf6c1f72.png" alt="image" title="image"><br><br>  The set of countries in which the Windows Phone Marketplace will be launched will also expand, in which it will be quite legal to purchase paid applications for Windows Phone-based phones.  From 16 countries, this list will be expanded to 35 countries, including Russia. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c73/6f9/d82/c736f9d82928f7a572bbd2909d7f5c8b.png" alt="image" title="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/93d/93c/fbf/93d93cfbf676f61b3f5aaa87962364f3.png" alt="image" title="image"><br><br><h5>  Small innovations in design </h5>  After a review of the development of the platform, technical demonstrations of innovations began in Windows Phone OS 7.5, which will be available free of charge to phone users as early as 2011. <br><br>  First, there will be support for the Jump List for the list of applications, now the user can navigate through the list of applications in the same way as through the list of contacts.  Plus, in the list of applications, a search appears on the part of the name, which is integrated with the Windows Phone Marketplace and allows you to search not only by phone, but also in the store. <br><br>  In addition, the possibility of expanding media sections with additional services was announced.  For example, services YouTube and Last.fm. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/004/64f/848/00464f848a2e835ca4374442891f21e2.png" alt="image" title="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9b9/b75/781/9b9b7578182ff627894ffccb53d70807.png" alt="image" title="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/31d/f21/e95/31df21e951d72076355f7ef59f26780d.png" alt="image" title="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0f5/ccc/198/0f5ccc198a175cf341a839d579b6c7b6.png" alt="image" title="image"><br><br><h5>  Internet Explorer 9 on Windows Phone OS </h5>  Windows Phone OS 7.5 will receive an update to the embedded browser.  The new browser will have exactly the same code base as the new Internet Explorer 9 and offer all the same features for hardware accelerated graphics and JavaScript processing speed as the desktop version of IE9. <br><br>  Demonstrated a slight change in the browser UI and support for changing the orientation of the screen from portrait to landscape. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d03/8ee/7dd/d038ee7dd26b6ac04e504805f93c70dc.png" alt="image" title="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/906/893/10e/90689310e2ac31735e306d0731120bc6.png" alt="image" title="image"><br><br>  Demonstrated support for hardware accelerated HTML5 Video in a new mobile browser.  A visual comparison of the performance of browsers in modern phones was made: Apple iPhone 4, Samsung Nexus S and Windows Phone.  In the test for working with graphics, the iPhone showed 2 FPS, Android - 11 FPS, Windows Phone - 26 FPS. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b33/476/f05/b33476f0537fb38595e7ff3915998a46.png" alt="image" title="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fe0/0a3/211/fe00a3211dcfc68fbf4995d54f66370c.png" alt="image" title="image"><br><br><h5>  Direct access to sensors </h5>  With the release of Windows Phone OS 7.5, developers will have access to more than 1500 new APIs.  Among them are direct access to the phone‚Äôs sensors: a camera for analyzing the video stream on the fly, a compass and a gyroscope.  A big pleasant surprise was the announcement of Skype on Windows Phone, which will be released along with the update.  Its interface was shown in the style of Metro and WP7. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9c4/925/503/9c4925503240ea7a0a8b31b9789458c1.png" alt="image" title="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4ca/a13/b85/4caa13b856e98a81791eab532993bd7e.png" alt="image" title="image"><br><br>  As a demonstration of the possibility of direct access to the sensors, an application for Amazon was shown, which scans barcodes on the fly and searches for goods on the site.  At the same time, a new feature of Windows Phone OS 7.5 was shown to attach not just tiles with a link to the application to the main menu, but also tiles with a link to a specific section or functionality in the application, for example, immediately to scan a bar code in Amazon (screenshot below). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d8c/2f7/23b/d8c2f723ba4512be98bdd20425445171.png" alt="image" title="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/591/ac5/1f5/591ac51f5a69bdf22401903bfe7c86bc.png" alt="image" title="image"><br><br><h5>  Announcement of Motion Sensor </h5>  Microsoft has announced a new set of tools for creating applications of the new type of Motion Sensor.  This set will combine the ability to work with sensors and camera movement for easy creation of applications such as augmented reality.  Such an application was demonstrated directly from the scene. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9af/af0/202/9afaf0202b32ecf299c4ee7a1823f29c.png" alt="image" title="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/044/b61/6b1/044b616b189f657ab604f039c73ce7ce.png" alt="image" title="image"><br><br><h5>  Multitasking on Windows Phone </h5>  Update Windows Phone OS 7.5 will bring support for full-fledged multitasking, which is based on the amount of free memory.  Programs will be available to switch while there is enough memory.  As a demonstration, they showed the official Spotify service application, which will be available with the platform update. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/055/7bc/ddf/0557bcddfd1e3d5a290463dd40903b57.png" alt="image" title="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9c2/f0a/119/9c2f0a119569f2b4eb19652c6783b913.png" alt="image" title="image"><br><br>  In Spotify, they started playing music and switched to another application using the special function to switch between running programs.  This application turned out to be the famous game Angry Birds, which also comes on Windows Phone, but much earlier, on May 25th.  While the speaker was playing Angry Birds, Spotify music was playing in the background. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7b5/e71/aa9/7b5e71aa93186fb2269175b4feeeb718.png" alt="image" title="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/670/6f3/324/6706f332488d3aebbcf9bca358e79dc7.png" alt="image" title="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2e5/ce4/661/2e5ce466193dc75da2c891c5552b15e7.png" alt="image" title="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/965/b91/3d1/965b913d176dce6095f1b176909638bc.png" alt="image" title="image"><br><br>  Multitasking in Windows Phone OS 7.5 will have a number of features: <ul><li>  programs will be able to update live tiles (Live Tiles) in the main menu; </li><li>  battery consumption will be monitored by a scheduler who will try to reduce battery consumption; </li><li>  background agents will be available that allow, for example, to play music in the background for third-party radio stations or music services. </li></ul><h5>  Socket support </h5>  The long-awaited support for working with sockets will appear in Windows Phone OS 7.5.  As a demo right on the scene, the wpIRC application was shown, which offers work with the IRC protocol on Windows Phone OS. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/691/257/9d7/6912579d7b3f52253050f5caf007c382.png" alt="image" title="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/afb/93a/403/afb93a403a4f4bca051f6b0a886abf3d.png" alt="image" title="image"><br><br><h5>  SQL storage support </h5>  In Windows Phone OS 7.5, developers will be granted access to embedded SQL storage based on SQL Server Compact 4.0.  Developers will be able to take full advantage of LINQ when working with the database and the data itself. <br><br><h5>  Developer Tools </h5>  Scott Guthrie appeared on the scene and spoke about the innovations in the application development tools for Windows Phone.  The new version of the tools will be available absolutely free of charge in the next month. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1f0/5a7/c76/1f05a7c76d6ebe6bc2b646cd2c7056e0.png" alt="image" title="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/69c/259/488/69c25948851d67ed239b5f1cedaa8e6b.png" alt="image" title="image"><br><br><h5>  Sensor Support in Development Tools </h5>  To work with sensors in the new version of the development tools added sensor emulation.  It was shown how to work with a gyroscope and GPS. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c4c/55a/990/c4c55a99043f06ab4a37311b8b7663af.png" alt="image" title="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a6a/d22/e38/a6ad22e389fdf589bdd404cebdfd4282.png" alt="image" title="image"><br><br>  The user controls the position of the phone in space through a special window and thus emulates the sensor behavior in the application.  Looks very comfortable. <br><br>  When working with GPS, the user has a map on which he can mark the current position, which immediately affects the operation of the application that works with geodata: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d55/824/9aa/d558249aabe40544f436fbeb80901039.png" alt="image" title="image"><br><br><h5>  Application profiling </h5>  A profiler will be added to the new version of the Windows Phone developer tools, which will allow you to fully analyze and monitor the performance and resource consumption of applications. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4c0/9e7/78c/4c09e778c3d9af2a6ea48da39cac3f50.png" alt="image" title="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/367/0fd/860/3670fd860380d8cb9c45dd0fdd7e0347.png" alt="image" title="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e0c/a5d/bea/e0ca5dbea9c028d14ee73ed6ad15c2c0.png" alt="image" title="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ece/b3a/090/eceb3a0907128ef6297c860f45c325ea.png" alt="image" title="image"><br><br>  During the demonstration, real cases of finding bottlenecks in the application using profiling and their elimination were shown. <br><br><h5>  Platform Performance Improvement </h5>  Scott Guthrie announced that updating Windows Phone OS 7.5 will improve system performance in four ways.  And it will not require any changes in user programs, they just will start to work faster. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/77a/617/1f1/77a6171f1a116dce29b0a4e686547a9e.png" alt="image" title="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fb1/3df/ce3/fb13dfce3492b35558ea552c3daa9e3c.png" alt="image" title="image"><br><br>  The following Windows Phone subsystems will be improved: <ul><li>  scrolling and input will be much more responsive and smoother, especially in scenarios with background data loading; </li><li>  images will be displayed faster due to improved decoding; </li><li>  the garbage collector was improved, which increased the responsiveness of applications and their performance and reduced by one third the memory consumption of applications without reworking them; </li><li>  reducing memory consumption is also important because the multitasking of Windows Phone will depend on the available memory. </li></ul><h5>  Silverlight + XNA </h5>  Scott Guthrie announced the integration of XNA and Silverlight platforms in the next version of Windows Phone OS 7.5.  Developers will be able to use both frameworks within the same application.  For example, use three-dimensional XNA models in a Silverlight application. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1fd/493/2f5/1fd4932f5046e0b064eef5519ed0884f.png" alt="image" title="image"><br><br><h5>  Over 1500 new APIs </h5>  In total, over 1500 new APIs will be available to developers of Windows Phone OS 7.5 for convenient work and creating applications. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/485/1e9/558/4851e9558303765627080969140f641e.png" alt="image" title="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c06/59b/e17/c0659be17db65cfbe61bebeff1e74a5f.png" alt="image" title="image"><br><br><h4>  Silverlight 5 </h4>  After a stunning demonstration of the new features of Windows Phone, the Silverlight 5 technology has arrived.

Microsoft announced the quick availability of the Kinect for Windows SDK toolkit, which will offer not just access to the 3D sensor, but also all the other Kinect features ‚Äî an array of microphones, a video camera, image processing algorithms, and data arrays.  The SDK will offer work with C # / VB / C ++ languages. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b6c/694/aaf/b6c694aafdad74cc6b30fb36c5b9ab64.png" alt="image" title="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/83d/ba7/c54/83dba7c540c27c44300f4a8794791d07.png" alt="image" title="image"><br><br>  In just a few minutes, a simple hand-drawing application was created using Visual Studio and Kinect SDK. <br><br>  Then began the demonstration of projects from enthusiasts, for example, the chair is completely controlled by gestures through Kinect. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b39/2b3/621/b392b362134ac574ff97cac7f88d34bd.png" alt="image" title="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b4b/2fb/2c8/b4b2fb2c80771359cdb9e17351f14fe8.png" alt="image" title="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/025/30f/6d1/02530f6d102a1285508effef05ec30fb.png" alt="image" title="image"><br><br>  The second demonstration was the integration of the WorldWide Telesope and Kinect telescope, which allows you to view the universe yourself. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c16/382/3e0/c163823e0950288d49784ab2bb27402f.png" alt="image" title="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/694/ba2/cc9/694ba2cc93db001407178b3e829c6179.png" alt="image" title="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b6e/cff/f48/b6ecfff48d05086f969bfa8caa29639b.png" alt="image" title="image"><br><br>  Then he showed a project for people with limited vision, which can help to move around in a building without sight.  The project tracks obstacles and other people and with the help of feedback lets the person know where to go. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/539/8d4/73b/5398d473b05444b59713eb7bab3996b4.png" alt="image" title="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5d7/c7e/233/5d7c7e233a316a1cc4ff1b70e1da4d13.png" alt="image" title="image"><br><br>  The latest project created with Kinect is a game in which you need a pair of players to take a position to pass through the scene.  I would have played a game like this on the Xbox.  Sea of ‚Äã‚Äãfun. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dea/cfb/a5e/deacfba5e4f23070c40b5ee54368b128.png" alt="image" title="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/662/9a3/c05/6629a3c05038c3f9a0deb9f082bb53f6.png" alt="image" title="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4c8/527/402/4c85274026a77055605a464ce2d9a889.png" alt="image" title="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f71/72a/c0f/f7172ac0f4d2e2dcef5ab7d25950af15.png" alt="image" title="image"><br><br>  The event ended with the announcement that all visitors in the hall will receive Kinect for free. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7ee/579/44d/7ee57944d5125a946d97e04992e81c4a.png" alt="image" title="image"><br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4>  The second day of the MIX'11 conference began with a demonstration of new features of Windows Phone OS 7.5: market distribution, change in UI, IE9 browser, direct access to sensors and sockets, Skype for Windows Phone, multitasking, Sql-storage, new tools with profiling capability and sensor emulations and more. <br><br>  The huge progress and advancement of the Silverlight platform was demonstrated and the official release of Silverlight 5 for developers and everyone. <br><br>  Announced Kinect for Windows Sdk with full support for sensor capabilities and new projects based on it.
