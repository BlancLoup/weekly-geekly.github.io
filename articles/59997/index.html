The forum organizers were at their best: there were a lot of young people around all the time who could always ask about something.  In some I recognized the students of my native department :). <br><br>  The forum program and presentations will be available after it.  True, where exactly is not yet clear. <br>  So I will omit the details, I will tell only what interested me.

      All questions to the content further ask directly to the speakers :).  I wash my hands. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The plenary session began with a speech by Arkady Dobkin.  For himself, it was a surprise <br>  therefore, his speech consisted mainly of wishes.  Looks like it's a minus to the organizers. <br><br>  Then there was a speech by prof.  Doctor of Physics and Mathematics, Advisor to the Chairman of the Board of the NBRB, Dean of the Faculty of Economics of the BSU Kovalev MM <br>  "Minimizing the aftermath of the global economic crisis for the IT services sector."  He constantly referred <br>  to reputable international sources whose names I don‚Äôt remember.  His presentation was motley <br>  table cells, "pies" and columns of diagrams and a set of numbers with different postfixes - <br>  "Billion", "ye" and others.  The meaning of the report is that we have created unique conditions for the IT business (and this, <br>  apparently, really), but that its development could move faster. <br><br>  According to him, a third of the IT services market is the integration of systems (in my opinion, <br>  this figure will grow strongly), a third - custom projects, 19% - support, 12% - outsourcing, <br>  4% - education in IT. <br><br>  The percentage of IT services for the domestic market lags behind the world average in 9. Although in recent times <br>  there was a large increase in this area.  This is less than agricultural.  It has been suggested that <br>  if the funds for the farm were sent to IT, then the growth would have been enchanting :). <br><br>  The percentage of the size of the IT market by country: 23% is India and is growing, 17% is Ireland and is falling, <br>  8% - England - stable, 8% - Germany and falling, 6% - Israel and strongly falling, 3% of the USA and falling, <br>  0.1% of Belarus. <br><br>  The global IT service supply is 30% in the US, but developing countries are already 30%. <br>  In the world, the information sector accounts for 6.5% of GDP, and agricultural sector, 3%. <br><br>  Now less money is spent on new projects.  But more is spent on hardware and software. <br>  With a margin of 10 times, the population that buys hardware and software leads, then the connection, <br>  banks (consistently 30% of their income), public sector.  On innovation in transport consumes all <br>  more money. <br><br>  To be profitable, each developer must earn about 40 thousand ye per year. <br>  If not, then the office will be bad in a crisis :). <br><br>  He compared our software industry and considered it in comparison with Russia, because much is very similar. <br>  He listed the following causes of IT development problems: <br>  1. few credits (during the crisis - little money at all) <br>  2. wrong taxation <br>  3. corruption in tenders and import software preference <br>  4. shortage of personnel (only a couple of universities prepare the right specialists, the rest are wrong) <br>  5. flaws in the laws <br><br>  Virtually all of this applies to us. <br><br>  What to do: <br>  1. Stimulate domestic demand (and at the expense of government programs as well) <br>  2. Education in IT <br>  3. Improving the efficiency of employees (less than 40 thousand per year - lay off :) <br>  4. clearing of inefficient companies (mergers and acquisitions) <br>  5. new services <br>  6. risk diversification <br><br>  SaaS will develop. <br>  It would be nice if our government introduced electronic testing, like in developed countries. <br>  This will help both applicants and our IT :). <br><br>  What are the current trends: <br>  1. Virtualization <br>  2. Cloud <br>  3. server of the future (I do not remember what was meant) <br>  4. &lt;do not make out what is written&gt; <br>  5. mashups <br>  6. specialized systems <br>  7. social projects <br>  8. unified communications <br>  9. BI <br>  10. Green IT (environmentally sound) <br><br>  Now IT should increase its advantage in relation to other industries, now demand in <br>  RB less than the offer. <br><br>  Makarov V's next report from RusSoft - ‚ÄúOverview of the Belarusian software solutions industry, <br>  services and products. " <br><br>  In general, it is necessary to develop and make together with Russia and Ukraine the pole of software development. <br>  Our advantages over the Hindus are high professionalism (recognized in the world) and <br>  teamwork skills.  India overtakes Belarus + Russia + Ukrana 15-20 times <br>  in terms of orders. <br><br>  In Belarus, there is an opportunity for IT growth by 60% per year. <br><br>  There was also a report by analyst <a href="http://dev.by/">dev.by</a> Alexander Yurut, "The Impact of a Business on the IT Industry of Belurusi: Figures and Facts." <br><br>  There was a report of the second section ‚ÄúThe right way to quarrel with an investor, or non-monetary indicators that investors are looking at‚Äù Denis Petelin ( <a href="http://www.agile.by/">http://www.agile.by</a> ).  Sometimes he takes part in the evaluation of startups by the investor (Russian) as a consultant for the supply. <br><br>  At first he scared everyone with the fact that he would use a lot of jargon, but everything was clear :). <br>  Investors ask a lot of questions, and not all of them relate to the business concept. <br>  Criteria by which startups are evaluated: <br>  1. Not advertising (social network that will live with advertising) <br>  2. Knowledge of target customer <br>  3. "spreaded market" <br>  4. sales forecast <br>  5. 60 days self-sufficiency <br>  6. profitability in 90 days <br>  7. profitability of 100% <br><br>  And there are a lot of such startups ... <br><br>  From the investor estimate 3 people: <br>  1. by business <br>  2. by technology <br>  3. on delivery <br><br>  When evaluating the supply look at the following: <br>  1. The team used to work together, what did they (not) do? <br>  2. who is responsible for what? <br>  3. How much is the idea worked out, is there a BackLog / SRS, at least for the first version? <br>  4. Is there a supply planning? <br>  5. What is the condition of the infrastructure? <br>  6. Is the process and development tools clear? <br>  7. How is the working day organized? <br>  8. What is the condition of the office? <br>  9. Are there newly married or fresh fathers / mothers :)? <br>  10. Overall performance and its warranty? <br><br>  Investors assign such a person who is watching you and in which case gives a signal to stop financing.  :) <br><br>  Presentation of the presentation - if you can do without an investor, get along.  This is how it is. <br><br>  The idea is usually taken from the business. <br><br>  I was also at the hour and a half master class of Sergey Arkhipenkov, who developed Agile at TsUPe.  <a href="http://arkhipenkov.ru/">http://arkhipenkov.ru/</a> . <br>  I do not undertake to retell this bison, I downloaded its reports from <a href="http://www.happy-pm.com/">http://www.happy-pm.com/</a> .  I am sure that his presentation will be available.  I think that his text was also recorded.  Recomend for everybody. <br><br>  After that, the BSUIR had a SEF section dedicated to IT entrepreneurship.  About 10 start-ups and projects (2 of which are mine) were presented to investors and representatives of our business incubator.  It was very interesting, but I can‚Äôt tell, because by the time the elevator pitch was tired and was not very able to take notes and memorize.  I think that in the media tomorrow there will be messages. <br><br>  Tomorrow I have an exam at 8:00 (in the sense that I accept, you understand) and at 9:00 the second day of the forum, I will try to report on it. <br><br>  I will answer only a couple of days after the forum, so do not be offended.  And sorry for the inaccurate text. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/59997/">https://habr.com/ru/post/59997/</a></p>
