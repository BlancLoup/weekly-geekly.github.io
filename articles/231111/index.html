The main thing is that there is a disease, infected by which a person turns into a person who is intellectually similar to grandmothers who have survived the 90s, and mindlessly scolding everything that is happening now (and that in our time ... yes, sausage ... yes, 25 kopecks ... It does not matter what we consider the subject area. It is important that you, grandmother, amuse me to the horror! <br><br>  While most users are busy searching for an ASCII-HEX translator, my remark about the system with which I have the honor to work for many years will cause many controversial issues.  DPI systems produce mixed feelings not only in me, but also in our online community, generating countless holivars and discussions.

I will try to be as brief and catchy as a predator, catching my own doe.  Therefore, it is better to study the articles about the <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/111054/">description of the functional</a> , <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/vasexperts/blog/313554/">architecture</a> and other materiel beforehand, too lazy to describe what has already been described.  And I will continue that the person does not want / can perceive some things, taking them as a given.  This is largely due to the effect of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25AD%25D1%2584%25D1%2584%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582_%25D0%2594%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B0_%25E2%2580%2594_%25D0%259A%25D1%2580%25D1%258E%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0">Dunning-Kruger</a> , but not about him.  In other words, you do not notice your hand while you have it, but when there is no hand, it disturbs you.

      It is very pleasant that your operator offers you reminder services (you could forget about something, drop money on the phone, for example) a redirect, personal account, online billing, speed limits, protection from you and your children, and packs of other weighty things. <br><br>  From the other hand, it‚Äôs very unpleasant when your operator <s>delivers the obvious game</s> to offer extremely important business logic for sale, like ttl-identification ( <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A2%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B3">tethering</a> ), protection against dns spoofing, blacklists of sites, unconditional redirect. <br><br>  But let's judge sensibly.  Let's come to the analysis not from the position of the subscriber, but from the position of a balanced person. <br><br><blockquote>  Items FOR: </blockquote><br>  - Technical progress, large amounts of data, dynamically changing reality and the Semantic Web offer a wide range of business opportunities.  No matter how much you want to be for world peace, business is aimed solely at making profit.  Unfortunately / fortunately, you do not have / have a business and you will understand / puzzled. <br><br>  - The set of features implemented in one device allows the operator not to rip the last skin off the subscriber, but to take symbolic amounts that are already included in the cost of the tariff plan.  There is also convenience in managing the network as a whole, which entails the same five nines (99,999), which is very important for the modern man in the street <br><br>  - Ability to provide even more services based on signature analysis, such as CDN networks, IPTV, content optimization / preparation <br><br>  - Real help for power structures.  It is not joke.  It makes little sense not to use such a powerful tool to enhance the safety of flow. <br><br>  - BigData, Statistics, KPI, ML, and many other scary words are very voracious for information.  Since we have nothing to hide, in the future it will improve the quality of services. <br><br><blockquote>  Items AGAINST: </blockquote><br>  - Of course, it is insulting for the principle of openness on the Internet.  The basic idea, on the basis of which everything was born, now does not exist. <br><br>  - Of course it is unpleasant that the "big brother is watching."  Although for me it is a matter of faith, and no more. <br><br>  - Of course, it‚Äôs unpleasant that earlier things, which are now difficult to use, require minimal knowledge of IT and special tools. <br><br>  Guys, underline. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/231111/">https://habr.com/ru/post/231111/</a></p>
