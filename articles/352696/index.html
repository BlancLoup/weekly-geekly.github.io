Or you have to do it with your hands where layouts are usually drawn, and this is not much better.  It seems the situation is beginning to improve - Flowmapp and Wireflow appeared last year.  And judging by the fact that it was with the tools for creating layouts, animation, and interactive prototypes, expect a big splash.

UXmatters publishes chapter 2 of it. <br><br><h2>  Design and design of interface screens </h2><br><h3>  <a href="https://blog.figma.com/introducing-figmas-platform-ee681bf861e7">Figma Platform</a> </h3><br>  At the end of last week, Figma noisily announced an open API that makes it a platform, not just a tool.  The result was an orthogonal response to the plugin system in Sketch and any other desktop tool. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b2f/f5c/ccd/b2ff5cccd4de87b63a792e095ae162ae.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  If switching from Photoshop to Sketch gave a tremendous increase in speed and comfort of work, then replacing Sketch with another modern tool is not so straightforward for a large team (unless your main task is to be at the height of trends at any cost).  There are pluses, of course - for example, designers on Windows (of which, if anything, an order of magnitude more) have a choice.  But there are not many of them to give up everything and again spend half a year or a year on restructuring processes, templates, etc. <br><br>  One of the main tasks that product design teams are solving is how to improve the quality of design ‚Äúlive‚Äù without constant wars with implementation jambs.  There is a ‚Äúsilver bullet‚Äù - design systems with components at the technological level.  But here, too, the crutch - design templates and components in the code live in different worlds, they need to be updated in parallel and with their hands.  Airbnb and several other enthusiasts showed last year <a href="https://medium.com/seek-blog/sketching-in-the-browser-33a7b7aa0526">how to export components to Sketch templates</a> , but this is still a crutch that requires setting up a heap of scripts and services. <br><br>  Figma has a different story - it already works in the web, the native environment of component design systems.  And although the ‚Äúcomponents‚Äù in the tool are still far from what is meant by this in technological frameworks like React, the link between them through the API looks much simpler.  The Figma team has already <a href="https://www.fastcodesign.com/90165051/as-design-and-engineering-blur-figma-wants-to-be-their-platform">tried exporting layouts to React</a> , and the ubiquitous <a href="https://airbnb.design/the-evolution-of-tools/">Airbnb once managed to tie up their design system</a> .  There are <a href="https://twitter.com/benjennin_gs/status/977087807100395521/video/1">other attempts to bundle a living product and Figma</a> , <a href="https://github.com/primer/octicons">GitHub learned to give icons to the product</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c29/b77/051/c29b77051a6aae6fb6702f617d3573ba.png" alt="image"><br><br>  So far these are all early experiments that guarantee nothing, and I rather paint my wet fantasies about the future, which does not necessarily happen.  Moreover, you will have to solve a lot of problems, including normal variables - now they are not in any instrument;  uniform colors, fonts and indentations on the designer‚Äôs conscience cannot be exported either (although Design Systems Manager from InVision goes in the right direction and produces some variables in all possible formats).  But if you heard about the concept of disruptive innovation, then with the announcement of the platform, Figma begins to look that way. <br><br>  If a year ago I thought Figma was fashionable, but not necessary, Mulk (it‚Äôs not necessary for many teams to work on the layout at the same time), now I believe that in another year it will be possible to think about moving. <br><br><h3>  Other tool news </h3><br><ul><li>  Added <a href="https://blog.figma.com/figma-prototyping-now-with-transitions-197f817ae7a8">transition animation for prototypes</a> . </li><li>  <a href="https://blog.figma.com/now-you-can-name-and-annotate-your-figma-version-history-250aa1b5caf5">Improved version history</a> . </li><li>  There was a <a href="https://www.papertiger.com/figma-dark-ui-plugin">dark theme of the interface</a> . </li><li>  <a href="https://blog.figma.com/component-architecture-in-figma-f16ae9cc4481">Thomas Lowry makes out in detail the capabilities of the components</a> . </li></ul><br><h3>  <a href="https://blog.sketchapp.com/prototyping-libraries-on-sketch-cloud-and-an-official-ios-ui-kit-in-sketch-49-bf090c70796c">Sketch 49</a> </h3><br>  The screens can be assembled into interactive prototypes, which is now the absolute standard on the market - InVision processing for entering the territory of the tools for creating layouts, which greatly underscores the need for it ( <a href="https://medium.com/sketch-app-sources/design-tool-choices-2018-a3e6a8ce87c6">Alexander Handley noticed this well</a> ). <br><br>  This has already been supported by <a href="https://blog.zeplin.io/flows-in-zeplin-round-one-c56550f23f0f">Zeplin</a> and <a href="https://sympli.io/blog/2018/03/27/introducing-prototyping-support/">Sympli</a> , but so far at the most basic level. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5bsptX8MdPg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  After a quiet fix of bugs between 2017 and 2018, everyone waited in which direction Sketch would move and this is a very strong application. <br><br>  Also now you can store libraries in the official cloud, added a full-fledged template for iOS, and the <a href="https://medium.com/design-prototype/sketch-49-find-and-replace-colors-everywhere-dc8db465026d">search and replacement of colors has become more powerful</a> . <br><br><h3>  <a href="https://theblog.adobe.com/march-2018-update-adobe-xd/">Adobe XD</a> </h3><br>  March update.
