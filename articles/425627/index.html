Today we will tell you how an IaaS provider can help companies involved in application development and system integration services. <br><br> <a href="https://habr.com/company/it-grad/blog/425627/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rz/wy/ow/rzwyow9bf4-w9at7agay9jjiydy.jpeg"></a> <a name="habracut"></a><br>  <font color="#A9A9A9"><i>/ photo <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ntnu-trondheim/26651372056">NTNU</a> <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/">CC</a></i></font> <br><br><h2>  <a href="https://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/kejsy/yunitera-razvernula-sap-dlya-mirbis-v-iaas-oblake-it-grad/">Implement SAP HANA</a> </h2><br>  As <a href="https://www.hpe.com/us/en/insights/articles/the-true-costs-of-implementing-sap-hana-1807.html">noted</a> at IBM, SAP HANA has a rather steep learning curve.  Therefore, in many companies that want to deploy this ERP solution, there are no in-house employees who can help with integration.  The problem can be solved by <a href="https://www.it-grad.ru/services/iaas/sap/">SAP hosting service</a> in the cloud of an IaaS provider.

      We <a href="https://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/kejsy/yunitera-razvernula-sap-dlya-mirbis-v-iaas-oblake-it-grad/">went</a> along this <a href="https://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/kejsy/yunitera-razvernula-sap-dlya-mirbis-v-iaas-oblake-it-grad/">path to the MIRBIS business school</a> , having implemented a system for managing enrollment of students based on SAP solutions in the cloud.  It consists of three components: the SAP S / 4HANA 1610 ERP system and the utilities for administering the SAP Solution manager and the SAP Content server. <br><br><h2>  <a href="https://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/kejsy/kontakt-centr-city-call-ispolzuet-iaas-oblako-it-grad/">Set up backup</a> </h2><br>  Backups cannot be stored in the same place as the backed up data.  There are risks even if the ‚Äúreserve‚Äù lies within the same data center.  For example, a few years ago, <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/news/lightning-hits-dublin-data-centres-1.881502">lightning struck</a> the transformer of the Irish data center and completely de-energized it.  This affected the performance of a large number of services.  In order not to lose data in such an absurd situation, backup copies should be maintained at different remote sites.  IaaS-provider is able to help with this. <br><br>  To work with corporate information, customer data and smart reservations <a href="https://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/kejsy/kontakt-centr-city-call-ispolzuet-iaas-oblako-it-grad/">, City-call has resorted</a> to working with an IaaS provider.  She specializes in the integration of contact centers with CRM-systems and sites of their customers.  A year ago, City-call handled about 350 thousand calls per day, and today this figure has only increased.  The IT-GRAD virtualized environment is a test site and a backup solution and provides new capabilities for the company's IT projects. <br><br>  At the same time help with backup IaaS-provider is able and integrators.  <a href="https://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/kejsy/pervaya-rossijskaya-baas-platforma-scorocode-razmestilas-v-iaas-oblake-it-grad/">We worked on</a> such a project <a href="https://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/kejsy/pervaya-rossijskaya-baas-platforma-scorocode-razmestilas-v-iaas-oblake-it-grad/">with Scorocode</a> , a BaaS (Backend-as-a-service) service for creating backup copies. <br><br>  In the BaaS system, all requests for end applications are divided between the respective clusters (API, DBMS, files, statistics).  API clusters are responsible for the distribution of tasks - they process about 25 thousand hits per second. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/h4/pu/kv/h4pukvax3l_qlcwro1bslq6u9h4.png"><br><br>  Several elements of Scorocode ‚Äúlive‚Äù in the ‚ÄúIT-GRAD‚Äù cloud.  The IaaS-service is responsible for maintaining the work of the registration service for application users and storing their personal data.  Also, under the management of the virtual infrastructure, there are functions for developers: JavaScript editor and analytical services.  All this helps BaaS-service to cope with high loads. <br><br>  IaaS services in its work and integrator integrates "KUBIT".  Last year, they deployed a <a href="https://www.it-grad.ru/services/ready-solutions/drs/">disaster recovery site</a> for one of their clients. <br><br>  It was necessary to migrate four portals and link them to the samopisny CRM-system in PHP.  Complicating the task was that these portals worked on the old version of MS Dynamics Axapta (it supported Windows 2003).  In "KUBIT" they decided to leave only two portals, and then deployed the circuit inside the network and in the cloud.  This has saved the client‚Äôs money and ensure uninterrupted operation of services. <br><br><h2>  <a href="https://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/kejsy/spearline-labs-irlandskij-servis-testirovaniya-telefonnyx-nomerov-vybral-it-grad-dlya-razmeshheniya-v-rossii/">Test applications</a> </h2><br>  During tests, it is important that the environment in which the applications are executed be as close as possible to the actual operating conditions.  So developers can get the most accurate picture of the health of the product.  But to reconfigure its own "iron" environment for a large number of services is quite expensive (in terms of money and time). <br><br>  IaaS through virtualization allows you to quickly raise a new environment without buying additional servers.  This opportunity was used by the international company Spearline Labs, which helps troubleshoot telephone services, compiles statistics on sound quality, DTMF tones, etc. The virtual test environment allows organizations to evaluate the quality of services in more than fifty countries (including Russia). <br><br>  Another case - the company "Speech Technology".  It uses virtual infrastructure as a test environment and platform for a number of its developments.  One of them is VoiceFabric.  The service allows you to synthesize text to speech directly in the browser.  Speech processing is performed in the ‚ÄúIT-GRAD‚Äù cloud, the user only accesses the system using an API and receives the result via HTTPS. <br><br><h2>  <a href="https://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/kejsy/ispolzovanie-iaas-kompaniej-zed-russia-dlya-predostavleniya-mobilnogo-kontenta-i-oblachnyx-uslug/">Monitor load</a> </h2><br>  The IT infrastructure has many levels, each of which has to be monitored.  It is important to monitor the "health" of servers and their components, monitor the speed of microservices and database queries.  For these purposes, IaaS providers install monitoring systems and help set them up for their customers. <br><br>  An example is the content company <a href="https://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/kejsy/ispolzovanie-iaas-kompaniej-zed-russia-dlya-predostavleniya-mobilnogo-kontenta-i-oblachnyx-uslug/">Zed Russia, which develops</a> entertainment and information services for mobile operators.  With IaaS, it scales monitoring services for a large number of applications and assesses the load on virtual machines.  The IT-GRAD cloud also contains the SMS payment system, content delivery system and the company's CRM solutions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_n/91/ly/_n91lyg9p1oigdvfa3of43zaeeg.jpeg"><br><br>  <a href="https://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/novosti/saas-resheniya-po-upravleniyu-dokumentooborotom-andok-razmeshheny-v-oblake-iaas-provajdera-it-grad/">Another case: DocsVision</a> is a SaaS solution for managing electronic document management.  The company that developed this system, Andok, turned to IaaS, because for her it was important to protect user data. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/p1/vr/y3/p1vry3j0nilgxtikhdq8_fgiafw.jpeg"><br><br>  We deployed a Windows Server client virtual machine and a SQL and mail server.  Then we set up monitoring systems at the data center level and organized additional protection through the built-in VPN.  IaaS allowed to reduce the cost of ownership of the product and more effectively control the operation of the electronic document management system. <br><br><hr><br>  <i>From network of stores to unique SaaS solutions, from large industries and airports to large-scale call centers and small online stores - IaaS solves hundreds of diverse tasks every day.</i>  <i>It turns out that for IaaS there is a place in almost every business, and in some companies the virtual infrastructure is the "heart" of all work processes.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/425627/">https://habr.com/ru/post/425627/</a></p>
