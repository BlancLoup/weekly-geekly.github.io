In this post, we mentioned the Nokia N950 smartphone with a physical sliding qwerty-keyboard. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/3cfb1e7a/6c9a89ea/11d9c4bc/6ed0252e.jpg"></div><br><br>  On the Web, you can find many enthusiastic reviews about the N950, and yet the device will not be on sale, as it is intended only for developers and released in limited editions.  Under the cat you can find out how remarkable this smartphone is, about the useful tools of its OS, as well as how Russian developers can get the N950.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Iron </h4><br>  The Nokia N950 is a MeeGo 1.2 Harmattan based device designed specifically for developers.  With it, they can start working on applications for this OS now, before the start of sales of Nokia N9.  Software and hardware Nokia N950 as close as possible to the N9, but still has a number of significant differences.  Of the benefits worth noting is the presence of a full qwerty-keyboard, which allows the developer to conveniently work with the terminal.  On the other hand, unlike N9, the N950 does not have an NFC module, and the AMOLED matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãreplaced by a TFT with the same resolution. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/a13cd30b/77acdf1f/276b935e/583253fc.jpg"></div><br><br><h4>  MeeGo 1.2 Harmattan: Developer Edition </h4><br>  MeeGo 1.2 Harmattan is a complete * nix-system that provides the programmer and user with maximum flexibility.  The N950 is preinstalled with a special developer-edition of this OS.  The latest official firmware (v22) for the N950 can be downloaded <a href="https://www.developer.nokia.com/info/sw.nokia.com/id/db230178-aa63-4c73-ba7f-20930da13cad/Nokia_N950_OneClickFlashers.html">here</a> . <br><br>  The N950 has Developer Mode enabled by default, and tools for analyzing the state of the memory, energy profiler, tracers, tcpdump, x11-utilities, and many other tools are installed.  The device has an available ‚Äúout of the box‚Äù terminal for working with the system with the possibility of obtaining <a href="http://meegos.ru/wiki/index.php/Nokia_N950">root rights</a> .  The convenient qwerty-keyboard only adds convenience when working with the terminal.  However, you can always connect to a smartphone <a href="http://meegos.ru/wiki/index.php/Nokia_N950">via SSH</a> using a USB cable or a WiFi connection to debug applications from a computer.  Exactly the same developer mode can be enabled on N9 - all missing system components in this case will be downloaded from the repository. <br><br>  In addition, the Boosted WG utility is pre-installed on the smartphone.  It allows you to enable the display of various technical information: fps, names of objects, their sizes and coordinates, names of styles and much more.  You can also use it to test the appearance of various Qt widgets, change the screen orientation, and take screenshots. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/c63d3e4a/d1f560eb/0c42a1e7/e6f5dbc1.jpg"><br>  <i>System window before and after the display of information in the Boosted WG</i> <br><br><h5>  N950 / N9 Application Development </h5><br>  The device has Qt version 4.7.4 libraries preinstalled (if it turned out to be 4.7.3 on yours, then you need to update the device to the 22nd firmware), Qt Mobility 1.2.0 and Qt Quick Components 1.0.  Due to this, many Qt applications with Symbian and Maemo 5 are already being ported to Harmattan. The main technology development for GUI applications for Harmattan is QtQuick.  The QWidget-based GUI and QGraphicsView <a href="http://www.developer.nokia.com/Community/Blogs/blog/aleksandr-trufanovs-forum-nokia-blog/2011/08/13/harmattan-orientation">are poorly supported</a> (there are no native styles for widgets, problems with displaying the portrait orientation in portrait), therefore, when building applications for Harmattan from scratch, QML and Qt Components are recommended.  In most cases, this makes it possible to significantly reduce the use of code in C ++, and in some cases, to completely abandon it.  Learn more about using QML <a href="http://developer.qt.nokia.com/wiki/GettingStartedQMLRussian/">here</a> . <br><br>  Support for developing applications for MeeGo 1.2 Harmattan is added to <a href="http://qt.nokia.com/downloads">Qt SDK 1.1.3</a> .  The SDK can be installed on Windows, Mac OS and Linux, contains Qt Creator 2.3 with improved support for Qt Quick, the QUEMU emulator with Harmattan, and supports debugging applications directly on the N950 via USB or WLAN (the SDK Connectivity tool must be running).  In addition, several N950 and N9 are available remotely via the <a href="http://apu.ndhub.net/devices">Remote Device Access program</a> . <br><br><h4>  Who and how can get the N950? </h4><br>  Nokia N950 is part of the so-called Developer Kit and, as noted earlier, is not intended for sale.  DevKit was released in limited edition and was provided free of charge to select <a href="http://forum.meego.com/showthread.php%3Ft%3D3597">MeeGo community</a> enthusiasts, Qt fans from <a href="http://www.meegoexperts.com/2011/06/%25E2%2580%2598qt-ambassadors%25E2%2580%2599-nokia-n950-invitations/">Qt Ambassadors</a> and developers who participate in the <a href="https://www.developer.nokia.com/Developer_Programs/">Nokia Developer Launchpad</a> and <a href="https://www.developer.nokia.com/Developer_Programs/">Nokia Developer PRO</a> programs.  Through these channels, developers have already received several hundred N950 smartphones, and about 40 devices have been received by Qt-programmers from Russia and Ukraine. <br><br>  Fortunately, a small supply of DevKit appeared in our Moscow office.  And we are also ready to provide these devices to the most active Russian developers. <br><br>  To do this, you need to propose a draft application that you will undertake to write or port for Nokia N9.  If we like the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãyour project, you will receive your Nokia N950 Developer Kit for development. <br><br>  If you are an experienced Qt developer, but you don‚Äôt have any suitable ideas for a mobile application, write to us and we will think about it together.  In case of difficulties in the process of writing an application, our programmers will definitely help and advise you. <br><br>  To replenish the number of lucky owners of N950, send us an email at forumnokia.russia {a_t} nokia.com <br>  with a description of your plans for writing or porting your application to Qt for MeeGo 1.2 Harmattan. <br><br>  A small bonus: bringing your project to the end and starting to sell it in the Ovi Shop, you will receive additional income, which is also very good.  :) All rights to the application, of course, are assigned to its authors. <br><br><h4>  Nokia Developer Badge </h4><br>  And since we are talking about bonuses, here's another one: we introduced the Nokia Developer badge on Habrahabr.  To get it, you need to write three posts with one or more of the following tags: <br><ul><li>  Qt and Nokia (both tags must be used) </li><li>  Qt quick, </li><li>  QML, </li><li>  Wrt, </li><li>  Symbian C ++, </li><li>  Qt Mobility, </li><li>  Qt Creator. </li></ul><br>  Each of the posts must score at least thirty balls.  You can post to any blogs. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/127869/">https://habr.com/ru/post/127869/</a></p>
