Specialty - radio physicist.  Specialization - Computer Electronics.  The main direction - the development of electronics and embedded software.  Experience - 10 years.  Experience freelancing - 4 years. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1e9/5c8/602/1e95c8602c9049289d09fba4d32546cf.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Prerequisites for relocation </h4><br>  Years of experience of permanent employment has formed an opinion about the futility of work for his uncle.  Your designs will always belong to the customer.  You will not receive dividends from the development in most places.  Someone will say - find another job with the best conditions.  It affects the geographical position. <br>  The capital of Eastern Siberia - Irkutsk is not the best place for the development and production of electronics.  Of course, at a certain scale, you can get microcontrollers at affordable prices for manufacturers in China, but at the start of work in Irkutsk introduces some difficulties. <br>  A prime example is the delivery of printed circuit boards.  For example, from Novosibirsk.  In some cases, delivery is performed by air, but through Moscow.  Sometimes on the ground - by truck.  In both cases, delivery takes about a week.  It turns out an absurd situation - express production of printed circuit boards from the week is stretched to two, taking into account the delivery. <br>  If you put together all the operations - the production of boards, the purchase of components and the assembly of samples - on average 3-4 weeks take place from finished files to collected samples, provided that double-sided boards and popular components are used.  After all, finished products still need to be sent to the consumer and again through Moscow. <br>  Analyzing the above, we can draw the following conclusion: the distance from the main logistics centers imposes some restrictions on the nature of the possible enterprise-manufacturer of electronics. <br>  The main theses are: narrow specialization, absence of competitors, loyal customer, large production volumes.  That is, no startups.

      So you need to move.  It remains to decide how and where.  For permanent residence with the family or raids here and there. <br><br><h4>  Moving to Moscow </h4><br>  It so happened that everyone in Russia goes to the white-stone.  He himself has repeatedly been on business trips in Moscow, plus many stories and acquaintances.  Help to make the choice helped case.  The customer for the previous project invited to work on the road in Moscow.  Fast fees and I already in Domodedovo. <br><br>  Further information on prices and terms is provided for further quantitative and qualitative comparison of the cost and timing of the project in Moscow and Shenzhen. <br><br>  The first priority is to get to the place.  The ticket Irkutsk-Domodedovo cost at the time of this writing from 11,500 rubles, plus aeroexpress 400. Next, rent a house.  Hostel options were not even considered.  Renting an apartment next to the metro is 40,000 rubles, plus a deposit of one month and related expenses. <br><br>  Action plan - we discuss the device, we design the scheme, we draw the board.  Ready files in production and at the same time the order of accessories for samples and series. <br><br>  Production of printed circuit boards - a lot of places from two days for double-sided board.  We order the two boards of the first version cost 8,000 rubles.  Components - typical found from past projects.  Transistors, suitable parameters, had to pick up 2 days.  Bought in Chip-Dipa expensive.  The second prototype of the PCB cost 4,500 rubles.  A nice bonus was the second free pay.  To meet the two days I had to go to Zelenograd. <br><br><h4>  Moving to Shenzhen </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/80d/573/946/80d57394661f472f86c27d3605fc4315.jpg"><br><br>  The development went on its own and the selection of contract manufacturers began.  Placing an order in Moscow, as it turned out, made the project unprofitable, so they decided to move to China. <br><br>  The first thing you need to arrange a visa.  The network contains a large number of specialized firms.  Perhaps the design of various options for a visa.  For long-term work, an optimal design of a reusable M60 visa for a period of one year with a stay of up to 60 days is seen.  The cost of 12,800 rubles, clearance of 5 days. <br><br>  Shenzhen is bordered by Hong Kong.  The most convenient is the flight to Hong Kong with the subsequent transfer to Shenzhen.  Ticket Moscow-Hong Kong from 9000 rubles.  Transfer - minibuses for 150 yuan (~ 900 rubles) to Shenzhen Bay.  Next, public transport or taxi.  All further prices are in RMB.  The course at the time of publication of 5.88 rubles 1 yuan. <br><br>  Upon arrival in China, the number one task is a local SIM card with 3G / LTE and unlimited internet.  I bought China Unicom with a tariff of 76 yuan (~ 450 rubles) per month - 300 minutes of local calls and 800MB of Internet.  China Telecom understands CDMA as 3G, accordingly this option is no good.  As I understand, in China there are only two cellular operators with normal 3G.  Next, in bing.com we search for baidu navigator and install it. <br><br>  A smartphone with internet and a navigator simplifies moving around the city.  Without knowledge of the language, you can show the route in the navigator to a taxi driver with route guidance enabled.  Plus, you can always choose options on public transport and taxis. <br><br>  A single word about the subway.  Quiet, cool, communication works. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b70/8f2/711/b708f271107c49e89179b23a8369394d.jpg"><br><br>  In all public transport announcements of stops, schemes and inscriptions are duplicated in English. <br><br>  The hotel should be booked a week in advance, for example on booking.com.  Better for a week or two.  This time is enough to find an apartment or another hotel.  Hotel cost from 100 yuan (~ 600 rubles) in a good place.  Some months have been living in a downtown hotel for 3,500 yuan (~ 21,000 rubles) per month.  If renting an apartment, options from 1,000 yuan (~ 6,000 rubles) for 1 bed room in Bao'an near the factories to 4,200 yuan (~ 25,000 rubles) in Shekou overlooking the sea are available.  Accordingly, more apartments are more expensive.  Everywhere contracts for a year and a pledge for two months. <br><br>  We rented an apartment with a translator, but as I concluded it is possible without an interpreter.  Firstly, a lot of apartments are empty, and secondly, you can bargain on a calculator.  Plus, the online translator helps a lot, again a smartphone with unlimited is an important thing. <br><br>  The first step is to determine the place of rent.  Our option - Bao'an - many factories where you can organize a full production cycle.  Then just go to the house vending, looking for house management or local realtors and agree.  Many housing departments have their own apartments, which will be immediately shown to you. <br><br>  Approximate view from the roof in Bao'an.  Factories and dormitories ... An exceptional day - all smogly swelled, on ordinary days the mountains on the horizon are not visible at all. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/872/f4a/c52/872f4ac5255a40a682d45bfd2df1def5.jpg"><br><br>  Internet from 200 yuan (1,200 rubles) a month, if you take a contract for a year - for the promotion they gave two phones with SIM cards.  Utility payments 2 yuan (~ 12 rubles) per square, plus water, gas and electricity on the counter. <br><br>  If the goal is to work a lot and drive around the factories you should buy a moped.  It is very convenient to travel locally to factories to place and control orders.  Power reserve at the electric moped 75km.  It is impossible to leave for highways, so if you go far away - a taxi or public transport.  The next step is to rent or buy a car.  To put the car on the numbers need a permanent visa.  To obtain local rights you need to have a visa with a stay of 3 months.  Otherwise, you need to make a notarized translation and make temporary rights to the police every month. <br><br>  As soon as the housing issue is resolved, you can proceed to work. <br><br>  A prototype order for a printed circuit board costs 800 yuan (~ 4,500 rubles) for 5 pieces.  A stencil in a frame for applying solder paste costs 200 yuan (~ 1200 rubles).  All items in stock in any quantity can be purchased at Segbuy on Huaqiang Rd.  Prices for wholesale components of Moscow, but retail.  There you can also buy any instrument - oscilloscope, soldering iron, multimeter and so on.  2500 RMB (~ 15000 rubles) was spent on the minimum arrangement. <br><br>  Laboratory in the hotel.  The first board was soldered to the manual directly at the hotel.  Then we found the Chinese performing the production of boards and installation of prototypes from 2,500 yuan (~ 15,000 rubles), depending on the complexity during the week. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/99c/f9a/900/99cf9a9009ed44aab2ec8df066afa673.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Subtotal </h4><br>  If we compare the possibilities of working in Moscow and Shenzhen personally, my choice in favor of the latter.  First, the cost of renting housing in China is low enough to rent an apartment for 1,000 yuan (~ 6,000 rubles), to equip a laboratory and not to worry about the money spent.  Secondly, the production of boards and stencils is 5 times cheaper than in Moscow.  Third, you can buy any components on the market at the lowest prices.  Boards and accessories can be ordered home delivery the next day.  The ideal place to develop and debug prototypes is the cost of housing and prototype production is minimal. <br><br>  In the following posts about the organization of mass production, rental of industrial premises and sales through AliExpress. <br><br>  Thanks for your time! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/233535/">https://habr.com/ru/post/233535/</a></p>
