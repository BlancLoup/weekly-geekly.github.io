  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Musical thieves, senseless and merciless</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  We all know that with the advent of the Internet, music began to circulate freely from person to person.  Many authors have already come to terms with the fact that their works have become available to anyone who wishes, and have begun to lay out their songs for free, contributing to the promotion of their music and their name.  Such people can earn either at concerts or doing serious work on the order.  Those.  There are two satisfied groups of people: authors who get some bonuses and moral satisfaction, and listeners who enjoy listening (if they are lucky with music). <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  However, as it turned out it can not be so simple.  In Russia, as many know, the organization of radioactive waste is rampant.  Other countries may have their own characteristics.  But now there is another way to scam.  It is not entirely clear whether it is possible to call this theft and whether it is necessary, therefore I will tell the story from the very beginning. <br><br>  So, there is a man, sound engineer, composer, poet, singer mouth.  In general, a jack of all trades, and a Swedish, and a reaper.

      It works days and nights, composes songs, writes jingles for radio, dictates smart texts, spins as it can, earns money to feed the family.  At the same time, his work, the one that is not paid by the customer, but comes from the heart, he freely spreads on many sites. <br><br>  And then one day the trouble comes from not having waited.  He suddenly sees his song, but with the indication of another author.  ‚ÄúError!‚Äù He thinks and begins to find out how it was.  As a result, it turns out that the authorship of the songs is ‚Äúindicated by mistake‚Äù on very many sites, and there are more than one songs, and not two, I am a dozen.  Moreover, there is a suspicion that the rest of the creations of this ‚Äúone of the brightest and most sought-after Ukrainian DJs and vocalists‚Äù are also dishonestly expropriated.  Moreover, the fact that the voice, words and music clearly indicate the real author is remarkable, but the scoundrel categorically denies his guilt, who places these things under his own name, and says that he has nothing to do and does not know who is posting on the Internet songs with his name. <br><br>  Later it turns out that this person didn‚Äôt just take on the use of other people's songs, it turns out there was a definite agreement on some works, and the songs were simply issued as an example. <br><br>  At the moment, looking for a way to counter this disgrace.  Of course, many sites will be notified of ‚Äúincorrectly indicated authorship,‚Äù but the results are not always bright. <br><br>  It would be possible to talk like a human being, but the person does not understand that he did wrong, unlocks.  Antique methods of solving the problem are not applicable.  We are generally against violence, but here we need to go to another country. <br>  I would like to learn from dear readers what methods of counteraction are possible, what legal tools are available if the name of the person and his whereabouts are known? <br><br>  Thanks for reading time.  The situation is very sad, my friend is a very good person, and I want to at least somehow help him.  And also to develop instructions for action in such situations. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/94513/">https://habr.com/ru/post/94513/</a></p>
