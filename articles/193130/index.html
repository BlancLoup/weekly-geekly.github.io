  <section class="page js-page"><h1>"Living" artificial intelligence, man and problems AI</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h5>  <u>The difference between the artificial and human mind</u> </h5><br>  Many scientists of the past did not make their brilliant discoveries in the course of calculations or numerous experiments (although, of course, experiments and calculations cannot be rejected), but thanks to instant illumination, whether it is Newton's apple or the table of chemical elements of Mendeleev, he saw in a dream.  Niels Bohr, who in his dream sat in the sun and watched the rotating planets around him, discovered the planetary model of the atom, Leonardo da Vinci, who decided to create an aircraft in the image of a bird and many others. <br><br>  But most importantly, instant insights are characteristic not only of the great ones, but also of each of us.  Sometimes we have problems related to our work, hobby, family.  And how are we looking for the answer to the problems?  We think, imagine, imagine, but often the answer is spontaneous, we can think about something that does not concern our problem and find a solution to it. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  But what about current computers?  Of course, they cannot spontaneously find a solution to the problem, but computers can ‚Äúthink‚Äù sequentially, performing one after another processor operation (by the way, people can sometimes learn from machines).  As a consequence, the path of development to artificial intelligence in the current computer architecture is closed (meaning the von Neumann architecture).  Yes, you can say that there are computers that have some kind of artificial intelligence that beat the grandmasters.  In today's world, machines with artificial intelligence are sharpened for very narrow tasks and are not able to make any sudden discovery - so to speak, to demonstrate genius or lead a ‚Äúliving‚Äù lifestyle.  If you believe Turing and his test, then artificial intelligence is sufficiently correct and ‚Äúlively‚Äù to answer a person to questions.  But will such intelligence really become alive?  Will he have any thoughts?  Can he later tell someone else what he talked with the previous person?  And if this artificial intelligence will be applied to science?  Will he be able to make a discovery, at least not as great as the concept of gravity?  The discovery that will be made thanks to the subtle associations taking place in his neural networks.  Can he become something alive in terms of thinking, and not just a super-heaped machine with billions of parallelization algorithms?  This of course we still can not find out. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/42f/dae/dac/42fdaedacd39ca15d8caea5965b84522.jpg"><br>  <i>1996</i>  <i>IBM Deep Blue and Grandmaster Garry Kasparov.</i>  <i>For the first time the car managed to win</i> <i><br></i>  <i>victory over man</i>

    <h5>  <u>Dependence of the person on cars now</u> </h5><br>  If we reflect on this topic and hold an association (perhaps not so clear, but somewhat truthful) with the relationship between people and animals, then we can see that people from the beginning of the birth of the most primitive society used animals for food, hides, domesticated them for their protection, and with the development of biochemistry, we use animals to create drugs.  Do not you think that this is similar to how we use the current computer?  Of course, we do not hunt for them, but computers were created with the aim of obtaining the most valuable resource in our time - information.  And computers perform vital functions for society.  But now we exploit them, and not vice versa.  Or all the other way around.  Thinking? <br><br>  Imagine that once all over the world all computers (no, they will not rebel, as in the Terminator) will break.  The collapse will begin.  Now even refrigerators are equipped with processors, not to mention airplanes, cars, and so on.  No phones, no internet.  This will be the greatest collapse, as computers in our time are already their own ecosystem, which was created between man and the world with which he interacts. <br><br>  Now imagine if all the animals of our planet die out in a flash - naturally this is the end, because the biosphere, as such, will practically not exist.  We exploit animals and computer technology.  Despite this, we are as dependent on them as possible. <br><br>  All this I led to a more fantastic conclusion. <br><br><h5>  <u>If humanity creates artificial intelligence that will be almost natural</u> </h5><br>  Will it simply be a copy of the human (or animal) brain, consisting of neural networks that transmit supercomplex principles of thinking that are not yet developed at the given moment of human development, or will it be a completely different architecture, incomprehensible to us now and not related to the principles of transmission signals by neurons?  If such an artificial intelligence appears, what will happen? <br><br>  Somewhat higher, I gave an example of how people exploit animals and computers.  And now think: have there been cases of successful and long-term exploitation of people as slaves in the history of mankind?  All slavery ended uprisings and bloody wars.  Animals and computers do not have consciousness, and therefore do not claim their rights, although animals feel that they are not at will (for example, a zoo, what is not animal slavery?).  So we may create an artificially natural mind that one day can understand that "it" is just a tool for extracting resources.  If artificial intelligence turns out to be on the same (and maybe even higher) level with the human mind, a phenomenon that will be the first in history will arise - this is a social conflict between organic and inorganic (although artificial intelligence can be with organic matter, who knows) societies . <br>  But what if humanity creates artificial intelligence not for its own benefit, what if it creates it as if they are people who are on the same level with us?  Perhaps artificial intelligence, designed in the form of a robot, will be able to get an education, work, and even start a family. <br><br>  For some reason, such a finale is rarely described in books by famous science fiction writers and films.  Maybe this is because the man is destructive in itself and if he creates a mind similar to his own, then he is as destructive as himself? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/193130/">https://habr.com/ru/post/193130/</a></p>
