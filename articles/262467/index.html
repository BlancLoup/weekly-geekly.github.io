  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Stop shot. Recorded and transmitted</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Frames decide everything.  In 2015, this phrase acquires a completely different interpretation: everything is decided by video frames, or rather, video, which has gained deserved popularity in all industries: from entertainment channels to serious medical and space projects.  The value of video content is obvious: it conveys the exact state of the systems and events, is simply fixed, easily perceived by a person.  However, more and more advanced video recording and creation devices create more and more uncommon tasks of transferring and storing content, which only serious and reliable software developed on the basis of best practices can cope with. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e81/e2c/a86/e81e2ca8698711917ced4c038d734eed.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Six years ago, just in July, the <b><a href="http://erlyvideo.ru/">Flussonic</a></b> project, a video streaming server, was launched.  During this time, the project has become a popular tool that allows you to capture video from any device, from webcams, from IPTV sources, from satellite dishes and broadcast via the Internet using various protocols. <br><br>  Today, Flussonic is used by telecom operators, large enterprises, IPTV services, content delivery networks, courts, oil companies, an airport, and even a cosmonaut training center.  We are useful where video streaming is needed, we know how it works and we are able to implement it even in the most non-trivial conditions.  Moreover, Flussonic did not stay aside from socially significant projects, such as the projects of the Safe City series.  Such a popularity of the streaming server is due to the growing need for video transmission from cameras in real time.

    <ul><li>  Use in educational projects - broadcasting of lectures, educational materials, practically valuable materials that need to be accessed in real time. <br><br></li><li>  Control and monitoring of technological and production processes - accurate information about what is happening at work sites of various enterprises (for example, the mining industry). <br><br></li><li>  Use in medical institutions both for control, and for training, implementation of clinical manipulations and carrying out joint researches. <br><br></li><li>  Capturing and broadcasting stream from video surveillance cameras located for security purposes in institutions, banks, on city streets (registration of offenses and fixing traffic violations). <br><br></li><li>  IPTV broadcasting organization. <br><br></li><li>  Providing conference broadcasts, event coverage, live event broadcasts, and so on ... <br></li></ul><br>  In all these cases, various video recording formats, information transfer protocols, and various equipment can be used, but the transfer requirements remain the same: it must be high-quality information transfer, and the video must be transmitted over the network at exactly the playback speed (video streaming essence). <br><br><h2>  <font color="#ff0b48">Flussonys Moget!</font> </h2><br>  The market needs in terms of working with video are almost limitless - each company has its own needs and requirements, each area requires an individual approach.  However, during the interaction with customers and the development of the service, we learned to do a lot of useful things. <br><br><ul><li>  To perform file broadcasting from MP4 and FLV files using protocols: RTMP, HLS, HDS, RTSP, DASH (in turn, the HDS and HLS protocols actually remove restrictions on the number of simultaneous users from the server).  We use a unique HLS broadcast in the cache-aware market that allows you to optimize traffic using the same URL for live broadcast and archives. <br><br></li><li>  Capture from satellites, transcoding, capture from surveillance cameras, stream screenshots - this is all included in the basic functionality of our server. <br><br></li><li>  If necessary, Flussonic records the video in the archive using a DVR (DVR).  In the archive, you can record and view real-time video from surveillance cameras without restriction on archive size, record and deferred TV channels without restriction on archive depth, maintain the required archive depth, work with various file upload protocols, send the archive in timeshift mode (then there is a shift in time, which is especially important for organizing the transmission of video on a schedule).  Users can create server playlists and configure Flussonic through a convenient web interface. <br><br></li><li>  Collect statistics, take user sessions into account, monitor outgoing traffic from the server and separately by flows, aggregate statistics by content and based on geo-targeting conditions.  Since it is obvious that such statistics are extremely interesting to advertisers, the Flussonic functionality provides for inserting ads into the broadcast video. <br><br></li><li>  Like any serious and commercially valuable server system, Flussonic is an API provider that provides full authorization via lua or via HTTP.  The API provides full server control via HTTP, allows you to receive various data, such as information about the server, stream, stream quality, list of open files and sessions, information about the status of the playlist, archive management and so on ... <br><br></li><li>  Flussonic is easy to install and configure via the web interface. <br><br></li><li>  In IPTV Flussonic is used with a huge amount of middleware.  Clients of all industries were able to evaluate the variety of protocols and devices with which our program works. <br><br></li><li>  Work with IP cameras.  Flussonic supports a huge number of cameras and provides high performance.  Users also appreciate the availability of the finished product for mass access to the city surveillance cameras.  This solution is demanded by many projects, but separately it helps small projects with a limited budget, heterogeneous equipment and the need to cover various types of devices. <br></li></ul><br>  This is not an exhaustive list of opportunities Flussonic, has earned the true love of users.  As a rule, the end user of video content does not know about the existence of such programs, because it works with the interface of the service provider.  However, the owners of business processes of companies and system administrators know the price of useful services that solve a huge number of problems.  And as you know, despite the popularity of video content in the modern world, these problems are not diminishing, but growing like a snowball: working with formats, trans-encoding, compression, quality and transmission time, support for protocols and codecs ... Probably, popularity and relevance of video content once and played a cruel joke, giving rise to an incredible number of devices, protocols, formats and methods of data transfer.  Therefore, a solution that can find a way out of non-standard situations related to streaming and file broadcasting is not only popular, but also interesting to the professional community from a technical point of view. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#ff0b48">We know a lot ...</font> </h2><br>  ... about working with video, IP cameras and IPTV, about codecs and broadcasting capabilities.  All six years of development, we tried new solutions, caught bugs, changed approaches, stuffed cones, solved nontrivial tasks and developed.  It is time to share your knowledge.  In our blog, we will talk about technology and the most unusual situations that we have encountered.  We will be glad to discuss with Habr a number of interesting topics. <br><br><ul><li>  The role of Flussonic in IPTV. <br></li><li>  Features support for various consoles and various packaging formats multilingual multibitrate video. <br></li><li>  Principles and features of working with the Flussonic archive. <br></li><li>  SQL access to the server and to the cluster that is used by Flussonic. <br></li><li>  Our unique authorization system, which allows you to customize the authorization as convenient for the user. <br></li><li>  Protect your streams from copying including using different DRM. <br></li><li>  Secrets of the implementation of projects that meet the basic requirements of the concept of "Safe City". <br></li><li>  Ways to reduce the cost of implementing video surveillance projects and live broadcasts using various ARM solutions. <br></li><li>  Undocumented features of Flussonic that you didn‚Äôt know about and were certainly afraid to ask (for example, PulseDB, the ability to use our applications with the watch, support for DASH, H265, SDI via the Internet and many more interesting things for both large companies and private fans to share video content) . <br></li></ul><br>  In each post, we will reveal not only conceptual ideas, but also technical aspects of working with a video stream.  Six previous years we worked on the Flussonic project, and we continue to work now.  It is interesting to us.  We think it will be interesting to you. <br><br>  Ready to answer your questions in the comments! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/262467/">https://habr.com/ru/post/262467/</a></p>
