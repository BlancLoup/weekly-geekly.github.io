  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What are the most popular programming languages: IT platform statistics</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Each programming language has its own scope.  However, some of them <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-most-popular-programming-language">are used</a> more often than others.  We wondered which programming language is the most popular.  To do this, we analyzed the statistics of several IT platforms: GitHub, Stack Overflow, HN, Habrahabr, etc. <br><br> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/it-grad/blog/341486/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ca/gf/xo/cagfxoafwxdqbfazrnivls5djou.jpeg"></a> <a name="habracut"></a><br>  <font color="#A9A9A9"><i>/ photo <a href="https://goo.gl/WvyDT1">Christiaan Colen</a> <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/">CC</a></i></font> <br><br>  Popularity is estimated by various factors.  Here are just some of them: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

      <br>
    <ul><li>  Mentioned in search queries. </li><li>  Mention in discussions on specialized forums. </li><li>  The number of vacancies, educational books and courses. </li><li>  The number of projects on GitHub and similar platforms. </li></ul><br>  For example, GitHub published the <a href="https://octoverse.github.com/">rating of the</a> most popular programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãby the number of pull requests (even the <a href="https://github.com/Subsurface-divelog/subsurface/pull/155">first</a> pull request from Linus Torvalds was taken into account).  In it, with a large margin, JavaScript leads with 2.3 million requests, whereas the following Python has 1 million.  Also in the top five are Java, Ruby and PHP. <br><br>  The popularity of JavaScript can be explained by its versatility.  The language is supported by all browsers, they write applications for desktops and mobile platforms.  However, users of Habrahabr <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/310262/">noted</a> that the rating is not entirely objective, because many developers in C ++ and other old languages ‚Äã‚Äãdo not translate their projects into GitHub. <br><br>  Stack Overflow for the ranking <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2017">surveyed</a> 64,000 developers.  Here, too, JavaScript has become a leader - 61.9% of respondents are programming on it.  Following are SQL, Java, C #, Python.  However, 72.6% of respondents are engaged in web development, so these results are quite expected. <br><br>  There are ratings that take into account several parameters to assess popularity.  TIOBE <a href="https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index//">takes into account the</a> number of specialists, training courses, independent suppliers and search queries.  The top five here looks different: Java, C, C ++, C #, Python.  And just behind them is JavaScript. <br><br>  The IEEE ranking <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/ns/IEEE_TPL_2016/methods.html">takes into account the</a> number of search requests, projects on GitHub, as well as references on Twitter, on Stack Overflow, Reddit, Hacker News, CareerBuilder, Dice and IEEE Xplore.  Interestingly, the R language <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/static/interactive-the-top-programming-languages-2016">is</a> in fifth place in it, and JavaScript is in 8th place.  The first four positions were taken by C, Java, Python and C ++. <br><br>  Another interesting point that was established was connected with the salary of programmers.  It turned out that more money is received by developers writing in less popular languages.  According <a href="https://www.stackoverflowbusiness.com/blog/the-highest-paying-web-development-languages-in-2017">to the</a> Stack Overflow <a href="https://www.stackoverflowbusiness.com/blog/the-highest-paying-web-development-languages-in-2017">statistics</a> , the highest salaries of the developers for Go, Scala and Objective-C are about 110 thousand dollars a year. <br><br>  But finding a job related to these PLs is not so easy.  The most popular languages, according <a href="http://www.codingdojo.com/blog/9-most-in-demand-programming-languages-of-2017/">to</a> Coding Dojo, are SQL, Java, Python, JavaScript and C ++. <br><br>  As for Russia, the leading Java programmers earn the most from us.  According to 2015 <a href="https://vc.ru/8247-it-salaries">statistics</a> , they receive 155,000 rubles per month. <br><br>  Stack Overflow also offers some pretty interesting statistics on the most popular programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãin the evenings.  After all, many developers, in addition to the main work, conduct personal projects in their free time.  And for them, they do not always use familiar tools.  Follow the <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/04/19/programming-languages-used-late-night/">link for</a> graphs of the dependence of the intensity of use of programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãon the time of day <br><br><h2>  ‚ÄúIn what language will you write the next project?‚Äù </h2><br>  Three months ago, the Hacker News forum created a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item%3Fid%3D14864389">topic</a> with the question "What programming language will you use in the next project?".  Discussion has 257 comments.  178 developers answered the question. <br><br>  We have prepared statistics based on these responses.  Leader rating - no surprises - javascript.  It says 23% of those who spoke.  They also shared preferences about frameworks - most often used are React (63%) and Vue (46%). <br><br>  But further - more interesting.  Leaders of other ratings - Java, C, C ++, C # - are not even included in the top five.  Places from second to fifth were taken by Python (13%), Elixir (9%), Go (7%) and PHP (5%). <br><br>  Closes the top ten C #, Clojure and Lua - they are chosen by 3% of developers.  Java and C ++ for their next projects choose 2% of the respondents - as much as Haskell.  A language C - 1.5%. <br><br>  Perhaps such an atypical distribution of answers is caused by the question.  When people are asked about their next project, they, firstly, imply personal projects, and, secondly, they only share plans.  They want to try something new, learn something, and not write in the same language used in their main work.  Another question is whether these plans will be implemented. <br><br>  We also appreciated the development in which programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãare most often discussed at Habr√©.  JavaScript is also leading here - the corresponding hub has 110 thousand subscribers and a rating exceeding 280. By the number of subscribers, C ++ and Python (105 thousand subscribers) breathe into its back, but their rating is lower - 165 and 196 respectively. <br><br><h2>  Upcoming trends </h2><br>  Hi-Tech.Mail.ru <a href="https://hi-tech.mail.ru/review/geekbrains-programming-languages/">identified</a> 4 programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãthat will gain popularity in the period from 2016 to 2025.  They are R, Erlang, Go and Swift. <br><br>  In turn, TeachBeacon <a href="https://techbeacon.com/5-emerging-programming-languages-bright-future">divided</a> programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãinto three divisions.  The first is currently leading Java, Javascript, Python, Ruby, PHP, C #, C ++, and Objective-C.  The second division is popular, but still not mainstream programming languages.  These include Scala, Go, Swift, Clojure and Haskell.  Some of them may soon enter the first division.  For example, Swift, which is increasingly being used for development for iOS and macOS. <br><br>  Finally, there is a third division with rarely used programming languages.  The most interesting are the languages ‚Äã‚Äãthat have appeared recently, but are rapidly gaining popularity - Elm, Rust, Kotlin, Crystal and Elixir.  They may well get into the second division, and in the future - and into the first.  For example, Rust is considered as a replacement for C and C ++. <br><br><hr><br>  PS What else do we write in our corporate blog: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/tendencii/trendy-oblachnogo-rynka-ot-tipizacii-reshenij-do-evolyucii-sla/">Cloud market trends: from decision typing to SLA evolution</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/tendencii/pochemu-xoroshij-iaas-provajder-ne-dolzhen-imet-sobstvennyj-cod/">Why a good IaaS provider should not have its own data center</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/novosti/vmworld-2017-insajd-glazami-inzhenera/">VMworld 2017: inside the eyes of an engineer</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/341486/">https://habr.com/ru/post/341486/</a></p>
