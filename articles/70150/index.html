  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Revolution 2.0</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Many have heard the view that the story is developing in a spiral.  Everybody also remembers the well-known wisdom that someone who does not know his history has no future.  Yes, and life itself confirms the above, putting us, humans, in the same play, but with other decorations and characters.  And only a ‚Äúknowledgeable person‚Äù can play its role so that the end of the performance would be different. <br>  Ladies and gentlemen, who did not notice - we are becoming actors, extras, and someone, perhaps, will get the main role in the play worn by the premiers by the name of "Revolution". <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  People.  He deals with his vital matters: sowing, plowing, reaping, raising children.  Nothing has changed here, it has been and will be for the same amount all the thousands of years ago. <br><br>  Bourgeois damn.  This one, too, has not changed much.  Here are just a field of activity, he himself chose another.  Previously, the land itself zahapal all, freedom of the people limited, his opinion imposed.  And now the copyright was invented and takes for him the taming is not measured and imposes a serfdom not feasible.

      But with the church elite did not work out, took its law, with a letter in their hands.  And he hews that letter of everyone who does not obey him and protects the damned bourgeois.  They say before all the power from God, but now from the Law. <br><br>  Plot.  And the plot remains the same.  And at the beginning the people and the bourgeois lived peacefully, because the people of that bourgeois himself created and gave him the rights, he appointed a servant of the people, imputed obligations and rights.  Mol protect our land, collect taxes, follow the order, strengthen the city walls.  In general, make our life better, and we will help you with food for it with a coin.  So now, the bourgeois came out of the people and the people were glad to him, as he gave him entertainment ‚Äî comfort for hearing, eyes and soul;  life is simplified with different things itish. <br><br>  But time went on and forgotten the bourgeoisie on the bread of his hearty ones, who he is and who he is for what.  And it seemed to him that he was in charge here, that the navel of the earth began to take its origin.  The opinion of the people he already on the squeak of Moor became similar.  He punished with a legal letter of damask to the left and to the right of those who looked obliquely towards him, punished contrary to the very opinion of the people.  And the people remembered everything from life not sweet, knew everything.  No wonder they say that the wisdom of the people.  And people began to go after the will of the robber, robing the woods, and the pirates recorded in the sea.  Rob bourgeois caravans, but the ships sink, open source in the Cossack sections.  Go away for volyushkoy. <br><br>  Actually here it is necessary to stop spreading the warrior on the tree.  Last time it all ended in no way nice and neither for the people nor for the bourgeois.  The great bourgeois massacre swept the world. <br><br>  Do we now have the hope that the bourgeois is aware that he has forgotten his place and business.  What will be the world from head to foot.  Hard to say.  Signs of the coming battle are already visible.  And the people's parties are already being created and the anarchists have declared themselves.  But the truth is, it is known in the middle.  It is clear to everyone that nothing can be free in this world.  And the anarchists in their positions are wrong.  But to live as it is not right now - here the bourgeoisie came to the rake again.  And do they have enough knowledge of history to take their feet off the teeth, until the head-on head arrives?  Here, Nicholas II, at one time did not remove, and the interim government did not step aside, and the sailors then gave them a history lesson in the fresh air. <br><br>  The conclusions from this lesson are simple, as we now understand everything.  Copyright is yours, who argues.  But only it is not for life and is not inherited.  As long as it is yours, any encroachment on it is considered a violation of the law, but if you abuse it, the people can declare impeachment to you.  And having the right to remember that the time corvee and obrok ended.  What I can sow in my field, without working out the corvee every year - once I bought this piece of land and he is mine, I want to sow, I want to give it to another, I want to build a house.  And the tax is now called tax and its size should be appropriate, and not as much as you like and appoint. <br><br>  We live in democracies, it seems self-evident, but our ancestors did not think so. <br>  Therefore, the common people can only hope that history will twist its spiral to whom and where necessary. <br><br>  UPD: I do not call for revolution in this article.  I do not give a qualitative assessment of the actions of modern organizations protecting rights holders. <br><br>  I just draw parallels between the causes of ANY revolution and current events.  And the reason for the thesis of Lenin: "the upper classes can not lower classes do not want." <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/70150/">https://habr.com/ru/post/70150/</a></p>
