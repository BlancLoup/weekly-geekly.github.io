  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The world's first free online laboratory of quantum physics at the University of Vienna at your service</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  We welcome our readers to the pages of the blog <a href="http://www.icover.ru/">iCover</a> .  Today we will talk about a very interesting development of scientists of the Vienna Institute of Physics, which opens up unique opportunities for free practical study of the foundations of quantum physics using the world's first ultramodern scientific laboratory in the open online mode. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/753/4ae/8e4/7534ae8e493c45f89ace2629d75af72f.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  High-quality lasers, structured magnetic fields, deep vacuum, ultra-low temperatures, and many other required ‚Äútools‚Äù will be needed by a specialist who wishes to conduct experiments related to fundamental quantum physics.  But, alas, the desires and capabilities of the majority of free enthusiasts and, moreover, schoolchildren, students and applicants of physical faculties in the mass do not coincide.  But who knows how many scientific discoveries worthy of the Nobel Prize would have been made, get the researchers the opportunity to confirm their assumptions experimentally, and students and schoolchildren at the training stage - really high-quality basic knowledge. <br><br>  To break the Gordian knot and make access to the capabilities of a modern experimental laboratory base open to all comers, the Quantum group from the specialists of the Faculty of Nanophysics of the University of Vienna, led by Markus Arndt, volunteered.

      Scientists called their design the ‚ÄúKDTLI interferometer‚Äù (Kapitsa ‚Äì Dirac ‚Äì Talbot ‚Äì Lau).  KDTLI is the world's first virtual experimental setup, which allows you to deepen your knowledge in the field of quantum physics at the level of laboratory experience and conduct scientific experiments of various levels of complexity in the mode of free online access. <br><br>  An international project announced by Professor Markus Arndt was launched in 2006.  The non-standard and scale of the proposed idea aroused the keen interest of programmers and specialists in various fields and areas of science, ranging from theoretical and experimental physics - and ending with chemistry.  At the first stage, the goal of the project was to create a virtual installation, which allows to demonstrate the phenomenon of quantum interference in the context of the latest scientific knowledge. <br><br>  The result of almost 10 years of work of the joint research group was the first in the world photo-realistic, fully functional virtual laboratory, which allows conducting experiments in real time using unique scientific equipment.  Today KDTLI is more than an interferometer.  This is a powerful software laboratory-technical virtual complex, which allows studying some properties of nanoparticles, optical and electrical properties, internal structure, wave-particle duality of complex delocalized macromolecules and much more in the context of modern science.  These, and many other features, will very soon be available to everyone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f08/e3d/89a/f08e3d89a56a4f18b4c62538f053a290.png"><br><br>  Attracting talented programmers and students from primary, secondary and higher educational institutions to the development team made it possible to maximally simplify the software interface and adapt the content of laboratory experiments in accordance with the requirements of didactic teaching materials. <br><br><h2>  Virtual Lab Site </h2><br>  The project website is divided into two virtual "laboratories" of various levels.  <a href="http://interactive.quantumnano.at/letsgo/how-to/">The initial part of the</a> program allows an online visitor to conduct experiments as part of a series of laboratory tasks and gain basic knowledge of the properties and composition of the molecule.  So, for example, with the help of an entry-level laboratory, anyone can get acquainted with the classical concept of a diffraction grating, known from high school textbooks, but in the context of the possibilities revealed by modern scientific research experiments. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7e8/cd9/da2/7e8cd9da2555414c988a8fb1427da37f.png"><br><br>  <em><a href="">Demo version of the</a> lab.</em> <br><br>  The potential of the <a href="">Expert Part</a> (available in both English and German) of the training program, which allows to set more than 100 different experimental parameters, is designed for an advanced contingent with a broad professional outlook. <br><br>  At this stage, the project is positioned as completely open, and everyone who studies this or that aspect of quantum physics in the framework of the available directions can, if they wish, contribute something new to it, having made their contribution to the world scientific physical library. <br><br>  It is very important that both parts of the program allow to <i>accurately evaluate the</i> results of the experiment, <i>not only qualitatively but also quantitatively</i> , which, given the prospect of updating the database and the scalability of the project, opens up wide possibilities for using the laboratory for research purposes at the highest level and experimentally confirming its own hypotheses. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2bb/9ab/c00/2bb9abc008714611822bc8bb3422a36c.png"><br><br>  <em>Expert Mode</em> <br><br>  The project ‚ÄúQuantum‚Äù, in the opinion of the developer of the script and the basic elements of modeling Mathias Tomandl, is ‚Äú... This is an excellent simulator for free flights in quantum physics.‚Äù And it‚Äôs really hard not to agree. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/3vPSFotrmME%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhi5IGly3-opUts-uCkTDX5h3IlDXQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The light version of the development is available on <a href="http://interactive.quantumnano.at/letsgo/">the project website</a> .
