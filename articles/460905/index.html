  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Minimal SEO knowledge for entrepreneurs</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p>  Hello! </p><br><p>  I would like to give a little more benefit to those who are taking their first steps in Internet promotion.  In particular, in SEO.  If you have firmly decided that you need this type of promotion (check out my <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/459308/">SEO</a> article <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/459308/">in 2019 does not work?</a> If you don‚Äôt know which tool is right for you, a note for you. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xr/0y/1n/xr0y1ncb4fqw0rhr9-a6jsinmja.png" alt="image"></p><a name="habracut"></a><br><p>  Everyone comes to the understanding of the need for SEO promotion in several ways, here are a few examples: </p><br><ol><li>  Friends / colleagues suggested that this topic works for them; </li><li>  There were independent attempts to promote your site; </li><li>  Internet-dependent niche (online store, informant, etc.). </li></ol><br><p>  In any of the above situations, people sometimes take numerous SEO courses.  They lead us to the main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe article.  When the owner of an online business takes a SEO course, his goal is not self-promotion, but understanding the topic in order to further select an adequate specialist.  Unless of course there is a desire to scale. </p><br><p>  If you haven‚Äôt decided yet, or simply don‚Äôt want to sign up for courses, but you need information, I‚Äôll list for you simple tools that allow you to have an idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãSEO from an entrepreneurial point of view. </p><br><h3 id="1-key-collector">  1. Key Collector </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/6z/m9/6m/6zm96msq9lgjokfrjtsxew09pwq.png"><br><p>  Everyone has already heard about the service <a href="https://wordstat.yandex.ru/">https://wordstat.yandex.ru</a> .  But the Key Collector program in the business environment is much less known.  In fact, this is the wordstat.yandex.ru parser.  But in addition, the program has just a storehouse of interesting "chips" that will be of interest to you.  For example: </p><br><ol><li>  Parsing search hints. </li><li>  Collection of requests for which competitors are in the TOP10 (if you have an account, for example in spywords). </li><li>  Removal of positions. </li><li>  Definition of a relevant page.  You can understand which page of your site leads to a specific request. </li><li>  Mass determination of the exact frequency of requests.  In wordstat (without additional operators) you get the base frequency.  If in a simple way, it can be tens of times smaller than the exact occurrences. </li></ol><br><p>  This is only 5% of all that this "monster" can do.  If you want to understand SEO a little more deeply - I highly recommend to get it.  Cost 1800r. </p><br><h3 id="2-avtomaticheskie-servisy-proverki-sayta-pr-cyru-xtoolru-i-drugie">  2. Automatic site verification services pr-cy.ru, xtool.ru/ and others </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/4s/1f/es/4s1fespgjkkc_qa0cvclxvsjpd8.png"><br><p>  They can be used.  But do not rely 100% on them. </p><br><p>  An approximate use algorithm is as follows: </p><br><ol><li>  Drove by pr-cy </li><li>  Found some kind of mistake </li><li>  Sent to a specialist, clarified why so </li></ol><br><p>  If this is a jamb of a specialist, he will most likely recognize and correct it (in the article I consider adequate specialists).  If this is not critical, he will explain.  Do not require the contractor to achieve 100% perfect results for these services.  Perfectionism is redundant here.  Try to drive a couple of giants sites like ozon.ru and see the result.  It will be full of errors and shortcomings. </p><br><h3 id="3-analiz-vidimosti-sayta">  3. Analysis of site visibility </h3><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/g4/ot/sq/g4otsqfrpm9wuh3uvuqczuy6rr4.png" alt="image"></p><cut></cut><br><p>  Visibility, if in a simple way, is the volume of requests for which you can be found in search engines from 1 to 100 pages.  It often happens that a person checks his site in Yandex for the query "buy crushed stone in balashikha", sees it in the top ten, sees a number of competitors and forms on the basis of this his vision of delivery in general.  This is not the right approach.  As a rule, in this case one or two requests are regularly "monitored".  For the big picture you need site visibility.  There are various services for determining this indicator.  As an option, <a href="https://ru.megaindex.com/visibility">https://ru.megaindex.com/visibility</a> .  Just enter the website address and see a rough picture. </p><br><h3 id="4-monitoring-poziciy-sayta">  4. Monitoring site positions </h3><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nc/qb/8g/ncqb8gpg2neptar4oh4_bwwrj4w.png" alt="image"></p><br><p>  A lot of services, I will not focus on this.  I use topvisor.ru.  He is paid.  You can fill in the service pool of basic requests and set the "on-demand scan" parameters.  Check when it will be interesting.  My system checks automatically the day after the Yandex update. </p><br><h3 id="5-yandex-metrika-i-google-analytics">  5. Yandex metrics and Google Analytics </h3><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jg/d1/r0/jgd1r08ecvsbrdbgzmkdryvxxok.jpeg" alt="image"></p><br><p>  Here, too, it seems to be clear.  The tool is known to all.  We go in and watch traffic from search engines.  In the metric, this is "Reports-&gt; Search Engines".  To see exactly SEO traffic, not general. </p><br><h3 id="6-proverka-teksta">  6. Text verification </h3><br><p>  Just read the first 2 paragraphs of the article prepared for the site.  This is enough to understand the involvement of the author.  If nevertheless more specifically, then: <a href="https://turgenev.ashmanov.com/">https://turgenev.ashmanov.com/</a> - shows whether you can get under the filter or not <a href="https://www.etxt.ru/">https://www.etxt.ru</a> - a batch check for uniqueness at several URL addresses </p><br><p>  It is very important (especially at the very beginning of the work) to read texts written by copywriters.  This will allow you to get an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe interaction with the project by the SEO specialist.  If the text is complete nonsense, then the specialist probably did not read it.  Why not read it?  Many reasons, the most common (not counting those who simply ‚Äúscored‚Äù) - the text goes through all SEO parameters, uniqueness, key occurrences, etc.  There is no time to read it.  I will not hide, he sent such nonsense to the client that it was very embarrassing after that.  I redid it myself later. </p><cut></cut><br><h3 id="7-semanticheskoe-yadro">  7. The semantic core </h3><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/7r/sw/0d/7rsw0dcv7xpwnoc5rei8sgebpqe.jpeg" alt="image"></p><br><p>  Without a core, in principle, there is no SEO promotion.  You, as a business owner, are interested in 2 parameters: </p><br><p>  1) Frequency of requests, it is important that it is accurate.  Sometimes it is denoted like this (column name in excel): "!".  The difference between the ‚Äúbase‚Äù and the ‚Äúexact entry‚Äù can be tens of times. </p><br><p>  2) Understanding that there are no junk requests in the kernel.  If the topic is commercial, there should be no queries like "how to set up wi-fi on iphone", "how best to build a bathhouse."  If it‚Äôs informational, then on the contrary, ‚Äúbuy iphone 10x Moscow‚Äù and ‚Äúbath in Moscow price‚Äù should not be. </p><br><p>  In summary: SEO from the point of view of an entrepreneur is a complex and lengthy process.  Often, incomprehensible and complex.  I recommend using this article as a minimal set of what you need to know and how to check.  If to simplify even more, we can select the following information that you need to own: </p><br><ol><li>  Semantic core (list of queries); </li><li>  Understanding where to see positions and traffic; </li><li>  Know what competitors exist; </li><li>  From time to time to read the texts yourself. </li></ol><br><p>  I recommend not limited to this article only and see at least one more.  Compare what other experts offer and choose the most convenient tools for yourself.  For my part, I can recommend promotion options that are right for your business as a pleasant bonus.  Judging by the reviews of the previous article, the problem is relevant for many.  I hope the information helps you do business! </p><br><p>  For all questions, write to <a href="https://vk.com/nfdude">VK</a> , dima.dyadyukov@yandex.ru, WhatsApp and Viber 89501784070. </p><br><p>  Article author: Dmitry Dyadyukov, SEO-specialist. </p></div>
