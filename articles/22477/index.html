  <section class="page js-page"><h1>TimeKiller or how not to make games for PDAs</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  As it seems to me, any game made for a PDA is by definition TimeKiller.  It‚Äôs hard to imagine a person who in the evening, drinking {insert to taste}, would sit with the PDA and cut himself in Lines.  An ordinary (in terms of monitor size and control method) computer is much more convenient for this. <br>  Yesterday I passed my beloved <a href="http://undercroft.rakeingrass.com/">Undercroft</a> (honestly bought through PayPal) for the sixth time and decided to download some new RPG for myself in order to think about it in the subway. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  After throwing on w3bsit3-dns.com.info, I stopped at <a href="http://www.arenagamestudios.com/index.php%3Fpage%3Dlos"><b>Legend of Seel</b></a> from <a href="http://www.arenagamestudios.com/">Arena Games Studios</a> .  I downloaded the trial version, installed and launched.  After 10 minutes, I turned off this toy and deleted it forever.  And that's why: <br><br>  After loading the game I saw <br><img src="http://www.arenagamestudios.com/images/products/los/screenshots/los2.png"><br>  For what "Touch screen" know only the developers.  In general, tapping on the screen, I found a menu consisting of New Game and Exit.  Settings to turn off the sound - no.  And in many phone games, by the way, they ask whether to turn on the sound right at boot.  I would gladly give this question a touch screen.

      Tapnuv on New game I was forced to read the faded scrolling text on the background of a similar color.  First of all, you can neither miss it, nor stop it to read it carefully, secondly it is hard to read on a small screen, half of which is occupied by meaningless slideshow with doubtful music.  After that, I was told that ‚ÄúChapter 1‚Äù begins and I got into the game interface. <br><br>  Developers, having established themselves, started trying to reabilitate with the help of a tutorial, the essence of which was that they took control away from me and for 5 minutes I was forced to read texts about how to move (I did not understand much), how to speak with the characters and that saving possible only in certain places!  This is the most awesome thing that can be in TimeKiller-RPG, I directly imagined how I was going through another difficult quest, almost at the end and then I had to go out of the subway ... <br><br>  Finally, they let me play myself, and I found in the bottom line that the playing field was 160x240 (half-screen), the rest was crammed with some nonsense that could be brought into the ‚ÄúPlayer stats.‚Äù Screen, Path-finding is absent as a fact, and the character moves only while I press the stylus on the screen. <br><br>  In general, without losing a minute, and being finally finished off with small arrows and buttons that cannot be reached with a stylus, I did what I wrote above. <br><br>  I want to note that this game was the third with which I tried to replace Undercroft, the first two did not even go through the stages of the first launch.  I turned them off without even trying to start playing. <br><br>  Summarizing, I want to say that, as in any industry, game developers need to focus on the end user, and not on the tenets of the genre.  In this case, it would be necessary: <br><br><ul><li>  Think about the size and organization of the elements of the game. </li><li>  Give the opportunity to persist anytime, anywhere.  (The most terrible flaw). </li><li>  Test, test and test management again. </li></ul><br><br>  And after the defeat of the game, I want to surrender myself (at least to show that he was involved in the game-building) <br><br>  Games released in the late nineties of our <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/ibear/" class="user_link">iBear</a> hands: <br>  <a href="">Top Manager The</a> author of the idea is me. <br>  <a href="">Russian business 2</a> idea author - <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/ibear/" class="user_link">iBear</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/22477/">https://habr.com/ru/post/22477/</a></p>
