  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Windows 10 on Raspberry Pi 2, first impressions</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On April 29, I received a letter from Microsoft saying that the first beta adaptation of Windows 10 for raspberry pi2 has finally come out.  The events were probably expected by many, including me.  How will it look like?  How will it work?  Fast - not fast.  Yes, in general, it's damn intriguing! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cc0/b1f/29a/cc0b1f29abac43698f1d6a689e6674da.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  By April 29, I had a box on my desk with a 7-inch Chinese monitor, a controller for it, and the actual size of the device with a credit card.  What goals did I pursue by combining all this?  I worked, and continue to work on my own CarPC project.  But I will write about this later, when it is ready and there will be something to show, now about the other, now about Windows 10. <br><br>  So.  The first attempts to establish a 10-ku were unsuccessful.  My first mistake was an attempt to install 10-ku only on the device, without installing it on the main computer - the donor.  The dism utility didn‚Äôt want to do this in any way, no matter what I do, no matter how I conjure.  It should be noted, by the way, that such attempts to do this were not only mine.  Someone even succeeded.  Here is a sprig on the official forum.  <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php%3Ff%3D105%26t%3D109160">www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=105&amp;t=109160</a>

      How did it all end?  Yes, as in the joke about Petka and Chapaev.  In it, Chapaev sends Petka to Japan to learn hypnosis.  The test was one.  Make our plumber play the accordion.  And Petka did not work.  After the fifth attempt and the fifth year of training, the plumber played.  He was holding a battery in his hands and managed with it as with a button accordion, while saying, ‚ÄúWell, I don‚Äôt know how to play the button accordion.‚Äù  Similarly, Windows 10, could not be installed without a donor computer similar to it, in the end I tortured him and he put on the C drive. Dism blew me a ‚Äúpartishen‚Äù completely. <br><br>  Well.  We put Windows 10 and on the main computer.  System as a system.  Start back.  And there is also a Spartan browser.  He, the infection, as soon as it starts up, all the time puts itself as the ‚Äúmain‚Äù, whether you want it or not.  And, infection, it is his operating system that launches, and not my beloved Chrome, which, by the way, is ‚Äúby default‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/db1/979/3bd/db19793bd2e846cc8257fb0c69b36385.png"><br><br>  But back to our "sheep".  The dism utility worked fine.  OS is worth it.  And here - voila, I see a headband.  It draws "Rasbery" and provides general information.  IP address, computer name, etc.  We study further.  What is this?  And here I was waited by the first disappointment.  I was waiting for another.  If raspberry OS is Linux, this is a full-fledged, multi-tasking operating system.  That is not here.  I really hoped to see something like a screen saver with tiles, like on Mobile Windows, but there's nothing here. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0ef/5ca/c77/0ef5cac776714b06826e8375a85b8989.png"><br><br>  Management of the "operating system" is carried out through a web interface.  We type in the browser, say 192.168.1.14, and see this.  On the device itself, nothing can be seen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/173/b39/5fb/173b395fbecc4ceea91c7036c938fff2.png"><br><br>  Well.  Let's write HelloWord!  What do we need for this? <br><br>  1. Install Microsoft Visual Studio.  Microsoft offers 15 version.  We put. <br>  <a href="https://dev.windows.com/en-US/downloads/install-dev-tools-visual-studio-2015">dev.windows.com/en-US/downloads/install-dev-tools-visual-studio-2015</a> <br><br>  2. Enable development mode <br>  <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/xaml/dn706236.aspx">msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/xaml/dn706236.aspx</a> <br><br>  3. Install the MVS module package for Rasbery development. <br>  <a href="https://connect.microsoft.com/windowsembeddedIoT/Downloads/">connect.microsoft.com/windowsembeddedIoT/Downloads</a> <br>  (Do not forget to register with Microsoft Connect, otherwise it will not work to download * .MSI) <br><br>  4. And now we need to establish a connection with Rasbery.  Roughly speaking, connect the donor computer to the device.  This is done in PowerShell. <br>  Here is the instruction. <br>  <a href="https://ms-iot.github.io/content/win10/samples/PowerShell.htm">ms-iot.github.io/content/win10/samples/PowerShell.htm</a> <br><br>  Further.  Open MVS.  And follow this instruction <br>  <a href="http://ms-iot.github.io/content/win10/samples/HelloWorld.htm">ms-iot.github.io/content/win10/samples/HelloWorld.htm</a> <br><br>  With minor changes.  If you follow the instructions word for word, then run the application on the device will not work.  At least it didn‚Äôt work for me.  It is not clear why they have x86 in the settings <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c23/3a6/412/c233a64126f441caa2907422fbadc3dd.png"><br><br>  And so - it starts. <br>  And further.  From the moment when I clicked on the Remote Mashine button and my application appeared on the device, only 2 minutes had passed. <br><br>  In conclusion.  What is Windows 10 for?  Yes, for the same as the Arduino.  Same.  The same LEDs.  Drives.  Sensors.  No more.  Still, I can‚Äôt call it an Operating System.  Is it needed for one application?  Even MS DOS could do more.  Is it necessary? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8a7/53f/5a0/8a753f5a045e4de1bd0f11b1c67690c1.JPG"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/258063/">https://habr.com/ru/post/258063/</a></p>
