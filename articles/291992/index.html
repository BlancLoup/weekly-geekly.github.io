Advertising</b> <b><br></b> <br>  It is perfectly clear to everyone that advertising is one of the main incomes of freelance exchanges, but its obsession and thoughtless location annoys the user, both on the part of the customer and the freelancer.  This could include advertising banners, freelance services, various non-thematic services and much more.  As an example, the service freelance.ru is well suited, where half of the main page of the site is littered with advertising. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <b>2. Information overload</b> <br><br>  Let us analyze the situation with a specific example: the user comes to the freelance market, for example, creating a logo and nothing more.  At the same time, he sees information that he doesn‚Äôt need about freelance services, portfolio tape, recent freelancers ‚Äôwork on  mathematical analysis of geodetic measurements‚Äô, a ton of projects in various fields, and so on, i.e.  information that overloads and annoys the user.  An example is each 3rd domestic freelance exchange. <br><br>  <b>3. Bias arbitration</b> <br><br>  This is a topic of perpetual debate for most users.  Many have repeatedly faced the problem when the project goes into arbitration.  And for the most part, arbitration gives preference to the customer, even if the rights are freelancer.  As an example, one can cite ‚Äúfast arbitration‚Äù of the work-zilla.kom service, where in the process of arbitration, no matter what, the site staff cleverly learn ten-day correspondence and delve into the process in 1-2 minutes, finally decide in favor of the customer or share funds between users in unequal proportions (with full project readiness).  Although positioning themselves as a freelance exchange with loyal arbitration. <br><br>  <b>4. Large commissions</b> <br><br>  Almost all freelance exchanges offer to carry out projects through the guarantor of the work and payment, the well-known "Safe Deal".  For using the services, the services charge a fee either from the freelancer (in most cases) or from the customer.  But only the commission is somewhere moderate, and somewhere, to put it mildly, predatory.  Even traffic cops have more conscience than some services.  In our opinion, the percentage of the commission should be a maximum of 5-7%. <br><br>  What interest commissions expose freelance exchanges, now we will analyze a couple of examples: <br><br>  weblancer.net - 5% commission, charged to the contractor; <br>  freelance.ru - 10% commission, charged to the contractor; <br>  FL.ru - commission 9.9-13.9%, charged to the customer; <br>  work-zilla.kom - 10% commission, + 5% when withdrawing funds (to WebMoney), charged to the contractor; <br><br>  <b>5. Lack of online support</b> <br><br>  A huge number of users, especially beginners who are ready to use the service and pay money, face problems and difficulties on freelance exchanges, ranging from simply adding a project, registering, paying, choosing an artist, blocking accounts, and more.  Most of them would be happy to ask their questions to the online service consultant and get a quick response.  But almost all freelance exchanges can not make, it would seem, such a simple solution as an online consultant.  Users instead have to look for contacts, write to the support service, use feedback forms, etc., waiting for their answer for hours, or even days. <br><br>  To summarize: unfortunately, many, including the popular freelance exchanges, primarily focus their service on making profits and personal goals, and only at the last moment think about the simple needs of users. <br><br>  We wish you more convenient and useful services on your way! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/291992/">https://habr.com/ru/post/291992/</a></p>
