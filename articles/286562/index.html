    <h4>  I. Developers, IT production, IT industry, IT industry </h4><br>  Let's start with the "monsters."  The remnants of the once mighty military-industrial complex of Russia, numerous research institutes and design bureaus, have been collected at Rostec ( <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A0%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2585">Russian Technologies</a> ) since 2007.  Most of the state-owned enterprises (GP) were first made by federal state-owned unitary enterprises (FSUE), and then they were joint-stock companies and transferred to Rostec.  The result was a whole ‚ÄúJoint-minded Ministry of Industry‚Äù of modern Russia (almost a million employees) with galactic formations.  Take, for example, the names of the concerns "Vega", "Orion", "Sirius", "Constellation".  According to the <a href="http://rostec.ru/investors/reports">Annual Report for 2012</a> , 339 Rostec organizations belong to the military-industrial complex (DIC).  Such truly galactic scales of Rostec should generate noticeable IT products in society and be the flagship of import substitution. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Comment 1</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  It was believed that it was recognized for a long time (it was decided, the expediency was proved) that the lion‚Äôs share of military products should be built not on proprietary developments, but on commercially available components (proprietary vs. COTS).  In the meantime, the principle is in effect: domestic SPARC, Elbrus, MIPS processors are only for ‚Äúmilitary computers‚Äù (it seems that these architectures are not suitable for commercial solutions), domestic operating systems (an abundance of slightly ‚Äúcorrected‚Äù Linux distributions) are also for ‚Äú military computer.  Theses are constantly heard: ‚Äúdual-use products‚Äù, conversion, etc.  Actually: the lion's share of components for the military-industrial complex is a ‚Äúmilitary secret‚Äù, a minimum of information and results visible to the public.  If US military IT projects presented the world with a mass of civilian technologies from TCP / IP Internet to IDEF notations, then the Russian military budget and the defense industry complex is not inclined to such ‚Äúbounty‚Äù not only for the world community, but also for the domestic civil sector. <br></div></div><br>  The current military-industrial complex, consolidated under the command of Rostec (and the final renaming of federal state unitary enterprises and the completion of the "OAO-nation" stage of the military-industrial complex should be completed before 01/01/2015, reminds not that a "monster", but rather a "dinosaur" living its "ice" period.  Despite the colossal funds allocated for its support, a huge human resource, the inefficiency of its work in the IT field is evident.  The ‚ÄúRostec Vertical‚Äù and the problems in the light of the ongoing ‚Äúglobalization‚Äù are shown in [29]. <br><br>  The development of import substitution of IT solutions (that is, not the consumption or operation of IT, namely the creation and implementation) is carried out by many state and "near-state" entities: RosAtom, the Federal Space Agency (Roscosmos), the Ministry of Education, JSC Rostelecom ‚Äùand others.  A significant number of enterprises of the State Corporation ‚ÄúRosAtom‚Äù (‚ÄúJSC NIITFA‚Äù and others) and ‚ÄúRoskosmos‚Äù are developing domestic IT systems, including electronics and software.  The Ministry of Education and Science owns research institutes and factories: FSUE VEI, Experimental Plant VEI, etc., incorporates the Federal Agency for Science and Innovations. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Note</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  NIITFA OJSC = Scientific Research Institute of Technical Physics and Automation, an active participant in federal targeted IT programs, such as, for example, the National Technological Base <br>  VEI = ‚ÄúAll-Russian Electrotechnical Institute named after VI.  Lenin ". </div></div><br>  Despite the scale of "Rostec", the "tidbits" have long been in "reliable hands" and the " <b>oligarchic</b> " army adjoins the " <b>galactic</b> IT army" of Rostec.  The ‚Äúvisible‚Äù favorite in this segment is ‚ÄúAFK system‚Äù, in which the following companies can be classified as ‚Äúimport-substituting segment‚Äù: RTI, Micron, Sitronics, NVision.  On the whole, V. Yevtushenkov‚Äôs gigantic ‚Äúdiversified estate‚Äù includes <s>Bashneft</s> , MTS, a bank, trading enterprises, agriculture and much more. <br><br>  It is the enterprises of the ‚Äúoligarchic‚Äù clan that play the decisive role - they are the owners of the country's main IT assets.  In addition to the "visible" in the oligarchic group there are many "hidden" formations.  Often, IT-Koreiko hides its possessions so thoroughly that only after many years, and only through international courts, do we know the true owners of the country's IT assets.  Consider several such secret clans - the "black holes" of the domestic IT industry with the main characters ... yes, yes - the ministers of communications (who else in Russia is better than others to live in the age of "connections", more precisely the age of "connections"). <br><br>  The ‚Äúinvisible favorite‚Äù is leading by a large margin - the group of St. Petersburg telecommunications workers led by the ex-minister of communications L. Reiman.  These are Svyazinvest and Synterra, Angstroms and Penguin Sovtver and much more, and we don‚Äôt even suspect many.  The material is collected bit by bit over their years: [1], [2], [8]. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Comment 2</b> <div class="spoiler_text"> In addition to conspiracy fraud, precedents are scary when the public is confident that a certain IT asset is controlled by the state, but in reality it has long been controlled by offshore "companies - gaskets" by some "mysterious personalities."  These are the "import substitutes" from the Bermuda and Virgin Islands were sent to Russia.  Moreover, intellectual property belongs to offshore companies (a similar situation with ‚Äúour‚Äù Elbrus processors).  It is also not clear when only the TOP official had time to participate in such numerous and complex acquisitions, and of course this ‚Äústormy‚Äù activity was not at variance with his direct duties.  What are the real KPI ministers of communications? <br></div></div><br>  Other examples of the monetization of the ‚Äúadministrative resource‚Äù include the groupings: ‚ÄúSchegolev and Co‚Äù [3] and the gathering power (assets?) ‚ÄúKazan ITeshniki‚Äù [4].  What grouping in reality belongs to the domestic IT industry?  How is it divided (sawn)?  Only a major scandal can illuminate the mysterious realm and highlight the part of the "Golden IT calf" hidden from the public. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Comment 3</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  In general, the issues of belonging of enterprises - import substitution locomotives to real and nominal, controlling (controlled), associates should be put in the forefront in the analysis, since  largely determine the motivation of the company and the "effectiveness" of achieving the goal.  Noble goals, IT patriotism, as a rule, are inferior to the thirst for profit, and the administrative resource is perfectly monetized.  25 years of the hegemony of the stereotype ‚Äúglory to the market economy, long live privatization and private ownership of the means of production‚Äù gave the result, for example, the privatized Russian Silicon Valley (Zelenograd) and the absence of domestic modern electronics to confirm this. </div></div><br>  The following ‚Äúby rank‚Äù behind large holdings of oligarchs and veiled ‚Äúgroups of telecoms‚Äù can be distinguished ‚Äúactively participating‚Äù in import substitution, a large army of <b>medium and small private companies</b> .  They are conventionally divided into system integrators and specific ones.  Here, too, the main lever is the ‚Äúadministrative‚Äù resource (otherwise, ‚Äúdry the oars‚Äù in Russian business realities).  System integrators (broad-based specialists) solve ‚Äúcomplex‚Äù tasks (often complex ‚Äúpopilas‚Äù), while specialized ones focus on a specific one.  For example, Baikal Electronics OJSC (T-Platforms OJSC, Rostec and Rosnano project) - ARM architecture, and MCST CJSC - SPARC architecture and Elbrus are actively engaged in the development of high-performance processes.  Most of the specialized companies work "in tandem", for example, CJSC "MCST" \ "INEUM" (as part of "Management Systems" of Rostec).  One of the "successful" integrators of the defense industry in general is the "Russian-American" RAMEC, headed by the previously mentioned A. Beltov [5], [6]. <br><br>  Each government agency and / or customer of IT solutions (from healthcare institutions to IO) has its own squad of commercial contractors.  Many companies offer ‚Äúdomestic solutions‚Äù by aggregating (assembling) or simply sticking their label to imported hardware (hardware) or software: ‚Äúwe have done‚Äù over the ‚Äúmade in China‚Äù label.  Often this is called "high-tech" R &amp; D. <br><br>  Small and medium businesses that develop and supply in the interests of law enforcement and government agencies are a huge army, but there are not many real import substitutes in it.  The factor of "success" depends on the "proximity" of the owners to the customer and the leadership of the relevant ministries.  Therefore, they turn a blind eye to outright profanation, and for ‚Äúreliability‚Äù it is even better to stamp ‚ÄúSecret‚Äù. <br><br>  There is a large civilian market for domestic software due to ‚Äúregulatory lawlessness‚Äù (frequent changes in legislation, primarily accounting) - manufacturers of automated accounting systems of banks (CFT, Diasoft, Inversion) and ERP \ accounting companies (1C, Galaktika, Parus).  Today 1C is a leader in the domestic market of domestic software.  This is a more or less real segment of import substitution at the moment, minimally prone to fashionable PR campaigns, like the production of domestic microprocessors, OS, DBMS.  Ideas about the domestic segment can be obtained from the membership lists of the associations mentioned below (professional communities), for example, members of <a href="http://www.apkit.ru/about/members/">APCIT</a> , members of <a href="http://www.russoft.ru/members">RUSSOFT</a> , as well as analytical studies, for example, IDC <a href="http://www.rusventure.ru/ru/programm/analytics/docs/obzor_it.pdf">Review and Assessment of Development Prospects for the World and Russian IT Markets</a> . <br><br>  Let us single out the ‚Äú <b>Academ-Regiment</b> ‚Äù of ‚Äúscientific import substitutes‚Äù: the Russian Academy of Sciences (RAS), Skolkovo (IT cluster of the Skolkovo Foundation), Rosnano, etc. Only in the RAS there are more than 500 scientific institutions and almost as many academicians.  The whole range of areas of import substitution is presented: from the institute of crystallography (by the way, 2014 is the international year of crystallography) to the informational ‚Äúproblem‚Äù IPU RAS \ IPI RAS.  For example, NIISI RAS - again ‚Äúin conjunction‚Äù with the notorious KB ‚ÄúKorund-M‚Äù [17] - are pioneers of import substitution (the ‚ÄúBaguette‚Äù computer series).  For many years they have been developing radiation-resistant microprocessors MIPS for military needs with the appropriate name ‚ÄúKomdiv‚Äù.  In addition to the RAS, there are subnational-level academies whose activities are financed from the budget of the subjects of the federation.  In general, also the most powerful resources with experimental production, scientific authority, etc. <br><br>  Unfortunately, due attention (not only the allocation of budgetary funds) to import substitution has not yet been noticed by the ‚Äústatesmen‚Äù.  Therefore, the place in the review of the state "strategists" is somewhere at the end (or well disguised).  These are the State Duma Committees (State Duma Committee on Science and High Technologies, State Duma Committee on Strategic Information Systems, etc.), deputies (Ilya Ponomarev, etc.), the Presidential Administration, councils and commissions under the President, the Government and those interested - developing (designing ) Ministries and departments, first of all, the Ministry of Defense and the Federal Security Service, the Ministry of Communications and Space Communications (FGUP Scientific Research Institute Voskhod, FGUP NTC Atlas, FGUP MNII Integral, etc.) and the Ministry of Industry and Trade (RosStandart, Institute for the Economics of Information Technology, Federal  Center for the Promotion of Industrial Development "- formerly the Federal State Institution" State Conversion Fund, etc.).  Council under the President of the Russian Federation on the modernization of the economy and the innovative development of Russia "(formerly the Commission under the President of the Russian Federation on the modernization and technological development of the Russian economy," all analogs of the "militia" - "the police" ‚Äîto completely confuse everyone), the Council for the Development of Information societies in the Russian Federation, the Military-Industrial Commission, the Interdepartmental Commission on Technological Development, etc. How many more are ‚ÄúIT professionals‚Äù and innovative (with IT topics), regional councils, agencies (  Tenzh "Agency for Innovation and Development"), committees, commissions and other structures! <br><br>  For example, Railways in cooperation with RosAtom make the domestic OS [20].  Only the Ministry of Defense (MO) has a lot of research institutes (central research institutes) in various areas (although not so long ago they were slightly reduced - ‚Äúoptimized‚Äù): from 27 Central Research Institute of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation (the oldest automated system of the Armed Forces) to 22 Central Scientific Research Institute of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation elemental base (after ‚Äúoptimization‚Äù, the subject was betrayed at the FSUE MNIIRIP), as well as the whole Academy of Military Sciences  About the situation in the Central Research Institute of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation, see [32].  VoenTeleCom and the mass of MO plants, the Bureau of Defense Solutions, neoplasms such as RosDARPA (Advanced Research Fund), and others. We emphasize that the MOs over the past 25 years almost single-handedly pulled the import substitution strap, however, thanks to the sanctions, others also thought.  The Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Ministry of Emergency Situations, the FSB have also long been ‚Äúin the subject of‚Äù import substitution. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Comment 4</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  The import substitution is carried out by the research institutes of Rostec, the Russian Academy of Sciences, the Ministry of Defense of other ministries, departments and agencies.  Most of them have basic departments in educational institutions (HEIs), which also deal (in any case, should) with the same problems.  Actually: there are a lot of institutions, and there is very little import substitution (mostly words).  Scientific centers, design bureaus, laboratories, production ... An even more volumetric part compared to the above state entities is the commercial (privatized) component - also working (or depicting active activity) for import substitution. </div></div><br>  ‚ÄúSuccessfully completed‚Äù (read - budget funds are used) programs: Federal Target Program ‚ÄúNational Technological Base‚Äù for 2007‚Äì2011, Federal Target Program ‚ÄúResearch and Development in Priority Areas for the Development of the Scientific and Technological Complex of Russia for 2007-2012‚Äù, Federal Target Program ‚ÄúDevelopment of Electronic component base and radio electronics ‚Äùfor 2008‚Äì2015 and other programs aimed at the development of a domestic IT structure.  And nothing has changed". <br><br>  Next, look at the professional community.  Industry-wide (broad IT profile) type APKIT, regional (for example, the Association of ICT enterprises of the Voronezh region).  ‚ÄúSoftware‚Äù (soft): Non-Profit Partnership of RUSSOFT, ARPP ‚ÄúOtechestvenniy Soft‚Äù, RASPO and others.  And they are engaged in the issues of import substitution and participate in the promotion of domestic technologies. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Note</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  APKIT - The Association of Computer and Information Technology Enterprises, although in it a quarter - Western companies are formally opponents (‚Äúmissed Cossacks‚Äù) of import substitution, which is reflected in Fig.  one. <br>  RASPO - Russian Association of Free Software. <br></div></div><br>  Nearby you can put the clubs "IT Directors" - CIO, since many companies have their own major software development units.  Further, consulting agencies for import substitution include information agencies that produce analytics on the domestic IT world and IT journalism (CNEWS, Open Systems, iks-media, PC Week / RE, and others). <br><br>  And how many individual import substitution enthusiasts in the country!  Many indifferent lovers of loners, small groups, spontaneous forums.  Frequently "Habrahabra" this should be obvious.  There are also unusual (ambiguous) projects like the ‚ÄúDomestic operating system‚Äú Phantom ‚Äù, in which the architecture is fundamentally different from the classical ones [9]. <br><br><h4>  Ii.  Consumers, IT operation, all IT users </h4><br>  Above it was said about the developers, manufacturers of means of import substitution, for example, in the part of the Ministry of Defense - about scientific institutes (in the research institute "Rostec" there are still military missions).  Now briefly "about the main thing" - about consumers.  This is a giant layer of enterprises and companies, as well as ordinary ordinary citizens of the country, who today are suffocating from the dominance of bourgeois electronics and windows and hopefully whisper: ‚ÄúWhen will we finally be able to do something ourselves?‚Äù Army, navy, special services, space and nuclear industry - only a small part of potential consumers of domestic IT solutions, which were key even before the introduction of sanctions.  Banks and state corporations that have fallen under sanctions have already felt the need to implement import-independent IT technologies.  For state institutions, first of all, health care, education, government e-service portals are an opportunity for significant savings, and for the country as a whole - a chance for the revival of science and production.  How many information technology users are in the country - potential customers for domestic producers: from corporation, SOHO segment, to gadget-users.  Yes, and the export of domestic IT products and services can reach a new level of quality. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Comment 5</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  The Soviet thesis: ‚ÄúMass and skill is the motto of Soviet sport‚Äù is more relevant than ever today in the following edition: ‚ÄúMass and skill is the motto of import substitution‚Äù.  The key role here should be played by the largest enterprises and banks.  For example, the unified solutions implemented by them should be published free of charge in a form sufficient for replication to anyone interested.  ‚ÄúChef assistance‚Äù - a gesture of ‚Äúgoodwill‚Äù, as opposed to ‚Äúwe will not tell anyone, let them follow the same rake‚Äù - can be a decisive force in a nationwide project.  At the same time, holdings should, if possible, be guided not by specialized and exclusive platforms (including high end solutions), but by mass (common, typical x86 architectures) typical configurations providing the necessary performance and reliability with flexible tools for scaling, clustering and etc.  In general, the allocation of colossal IT budgets, given for providing competitive advantages, for example, state banks, to automate the same business processes, is simply waste of taxpayers' money.  We developed (chose) a single solution together - they replicated as much as possible, and the specificity of ‚Äústate usury institutions‚Äù was a far-fetched and archaic cover for inefficient IT costs (extremely inefficient in terms of the scale of the state).  The principle works: "disunity in the typification and development of the industry, but unity in collusion and speculation." <br><br>  Without the support of the ‚Äúbig brother‚Äù (leaders of the region with free examples to follow), the introduction of import-substituting technologies in the wider environment of business users - for most companies is an overwhelming task, because  appetites of system integrators and developers are excessive [33].  And they will try to work on the topic of import substitution to the ‚Äúmaximum‚Äù (the huge ‚Äúimport substitution soap bubble‚Äù is already swelling).  Therefore, it is extremely important to initially expand the segment of active consumers of import substitution to the smallest companies, to create a ‚Äúcritical‚Äù mass, which immediately occupied the frontiers won by large holdings and state institutions from western vendors. <br><br>  On the Internet, you can find rare information on the experience of introducing free software (for example, [18], [26]) or complex domestic solutions (as a rule, only advertising).  Today, in large companies, dedicated groups on import substitution are relevant: coordination of work with similar groups of other companies, with domestic vendors, exchange of experience, creation of own stands / laboratories, participation in implementation in other companies.  Cooperation in ordering new solutions, joint orders (financing and control).  Association in industry unions on import substitution - today there is not a single non-commercial (independent) coordinating center for complex tasks of import substitution.  And this is in spite of the highest priority declared by the government for import substitution of IT solutions. <br></div></div><br><h4>  Dislocation of import substitution forces </h4><br>  In general, the forces of import substitution and their disposition are shown in fig.  1 "The deployment of the shock group IT import substitution": <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a8c/46b/728/a8c46b728dea46278e6f8c5eb01691f0.jpg"><br>  <i>Fig.</i>  <i>one</i> <br><br>  The map shows the situation: <br><br>  1) The occupying forces of the western giants of the IT industry (Microsoft, HP, Cisco, etc.) have firmly consolidated on the IT market (front) of Russia.  For example, in the IT equipment front area, the share of domestic manufacturers in the Russian IT market is close to zero (the occupation is shown in the diagram by the outlines of the Russian Federation, indicating western vendors). <br><br>  2) Russian defense equipment and software developers are trying to break through the deeply echeloned defense of the invaders.  At the forefront of the Russian IT squadron are the remnants of the Soviet military-industrial complex still beating in the agony of privatization, restructuring, and a crisis of control (command). <br><br>  3) Patriotic IT users (information technology users) have been waiting for ‚ÄúSinop IT battles‚Äù (or similar) for more than a quarter of a century and whispering with hope: ‚ÄúWhen will our people come?‚Äù Will modern Ushakovs and Nakhimovs appear in the Russian IT industry?  Which, despite the repeated superiority of the enemy forces, will triumphantly hoist the Russian flag over the country's IT market. <br><br>  In the meantime, the general intent, tactics, and timing of the attack are still kept secret by IT generals.  If only the reports were periodically transmitted: ‚Äúaccording to the IT bureau, a critical situation remains at the front ...‚Äù.  Despite the humorous genre of drawing, the picture is super serious. <br><br><h4>  Iii.  Consideration in the "second reading" </h4><br>  Below, we give fragmentary generalizations and consider examples, including the level of combat effectiveness of individual IT formations. <br><br>  <b>Rostec</b> .  Publicity at least, the main work in the "top secret".  What enterprises do in import substitution of IT technologies actually do, what specific tasks are set, what ways are they planned to be approached, thematic polemics - how to optimally solve the problem of import substitution - almost everything is covered with mystery.  All previous developments on import substitution (including cuts) are strictly classified.  Initially, the task was declared to save the remnants of state-owned enterprises, to provide centralized leadership, to end the hostility, to establish their cooperation (the mission of "Rostec").  But in fact: they didn‚Äôt manage to dry the ink of the decrees on the transfer of enterprises (shares) to Rostec - some kind of avant-garde IT import substitution, how they are sold, who on an IPO [10], and who "only in good hands" [11] . <br><br>  Lessons for previously "grabbed" enterprises were not enough.  ¬´-- ¬ª  ¬´ ¬ª [31] (   ,  ).   ¬´¬ª   - [29],      ,     [19].
