    <a name="habracut"></a><h4>  Decision making </h4><br>  As sources of guaranteed and uninterrupted power supply, we decided to use <b>DDBP</b> (diesel dynamic uninterruptible power supply), aka Flywheel UPS or DRUPS.  The technology was used in the USSR and was called UGP (installation of a guaranteed power supply).  The principle of operation of the machine is based on ensuring the rotation of the alternator (synchronous reversible electric machine), which can operate in the mode of a motor or generator. <br><br>  The continuity of the rotation of the electric machine during problems with external power is provided by the accumulated kinetic energy.  An enormous flywheel attached to the shaft of a reversible machine is used as a storage of kinetic energy. <br><br>  Flywheels as accumulators of kinetic energy are used in DDIBP, limited to a ruler of 1 MW.  In more powerful DDIBP devices, so-called kinetic modules are used.  The operation of these devices is based on a combination of mechanical and electrical principles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f35/c77/7ba/f35c777ba4935c29273725a8fc2160a3.png"><br><br><h4>  How it works </h4><br>  <b>If there is satisfactory external power (from the city)</b> <ol><li>  The synchronous electric machine (alternator - 3) rotates idling in the mode of an electric motor; </li><li>  The kinetic module (energy storage - 4) rotates on the same shaft with the synchronous electric machine (alternator); </li><li>  Diesel (1) with a heated crankcase is in standby mode, quick start; </li><li>  The clutch (2) connecting the diesel with electric cars is open; </li><li>  The choke (5), using the energy of the alternator, ‚Äúcleans‚Äù the power supply and the output is an almost perfect sinusoid. </li><li>  The automatic bypass (9) is open. </li></ol>  <b>If external power disappears or becomes unsatisfactory</b> <br>  The untwisted flywheel continues to rotate by inertia, giving away the accumulated kinetic energy to the synchronous electric machine.  She, in turn, from the mode of the electric motor goes into the mode of the generator and produces electricity to the consumer. <ol><li>  The kinetic module (energy storage - 4) rotates and continues to rotate the synchronous electric machine (alternator - 3); </li><li>  Diesel (1) receives a start command and spins up to the required speed; </li><li>  The clutch (2) is activated, connecting the diesel shaft with the shaft of the electric machine; </li><li>  The electric car continues to rotate at the expense of diesel power; </li><li>  The kinetic module (energy storage - 4) rotates, accumulating energy. </li></ol>  Electricity consumers continue to receive electricity without noticing the problem. <br><br>  According to statistics from manufacturers of DDIBP, 98% of the incidents with external electricity are short-lived, and the autonomy time of the DDIBP on the untwisted flywheel is enough to eliminate them.  Problems that are more durable are accompanied by the launch and connection of a diesel engine to electric cars by coupling coupling. <br><br><h4>  12 pros </h4><ol><li>  A single system is able to reserve more power; </li><li>  Just in operation (especially important in the regions); </li><li>  Does not require the installation of air conditioners for cooling (we save on air conditioners and power for them); </li><li>  Low operating costs for maintenance; </li><li>  High efficiency with a minimum load volume (almost linear graph of 40%); </li><li>  The minimum amount of power electronics .; </li><li>  High operating time before output to overhaul (10 years); </li><li>  Does not require a reserve of power to charge the batteries (10-15% of the power consumption of the UPS systems); </li><li>  Resistant to short-circuit currents; </li><li>  The cost is comparable to the classic systems of guaranteed and uninterrupted power used in modern data centers; </li><li>  It occupies a smaller area than the classic static DDBP. </li><li>  At idle running, as a synchronous compensator. </li></ol>  At the last stop a little more.  Over-excited synchronous motor idling is used as a compensator for reactive power.  We get the opportunity not to pay for the reactive component of electrical power, compensating for its use by DDBP. <br><br><h4>  What is active and reactive power? </h4><br>  In most cases, electrical circuits contain both active and reactive resistances.  In active resistance circuits, electrical energy is completely converted to heat, doing useful work.  Unit of watts (W).  In AC circuits containing, along with active resistances inductive and capacitive loads, there are losses to reactive power due to the presence of magnetic and electric fields in electrical circuits.  Conventionally, this power is not spent on useful work.  The unit of measurement is a volt-ampere reactive (pitch) or kilovolt-ampere reactive (quart). <br><br>  Given that the data center in Yaroslavl is being built, as it was written earlier, near the walls of the Yarpivo brewery, for clarity, we can consider an example on a glass of beer.  The glass is filled with a layer of useless foam (reactive power).  We pay for it as part of drunk beer, but only the volume of active liquid (active power) does useful work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d04/451/adb/d04451adb9679c6203a9a770fe21a684.png"><br><br>  The sum of active and reactive power, is the total power. <br><br>  The ratio of the active power of an electrical circuit to the total power is called the power factor or ‚Äúcosine phi‚Äù (cos œÜ): <br><br><blockquote>  Power Factor = Active Power / Total Power </blockquote><br>  Power factor can not be greater than one.  If the active power is equal to the total power, and this indicates the absence of a reactive load, cos œÜ = 1 (unit).  For a practical example, - cos œÜ of the server = 0.95, and cos œÜ of the air conditioner = 0.7.  From here it is already clear how much percentage we pay for foam). <br><br><h4>  Practical choice </h4><br>  When studying the market, we found out that there are only four leading manufacturers, whose equipment is installed in the data center, all located in European countries. <ol><li>  Piller - Germany </li><li>  Hitec - Holland </li><li>  Hitzinger - Austria </li><li>  Evrodisel - Belgium </li></ol>  All work in large power ranges, have a good production base, all are represented in data centers and have a positive history and reviews.  Accordingly, there is a competitive environment. <br><br><h4>  Interesting design features </h4><br>  <b>Hitzinger, Evrodisel, Hitec</b> <br>  DDIBP data manufacturers have a classic layout of aggregates (coaxially).  Kinetic drive double support.  It has a hard connection with the alternator. <br><br>  This is what it looks like: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8fa/1ff/c18/8fa1ffc1806df803b1b93a9ce2afddbc.jpg"><br><br>  Advantages: simplicity and minimal amount of power electronics. <br><br>  <b>Piller</b> <br>  It works on the same principle as the classic DDBP - but the kinetic energy storage device is not placed on the same frame with the other components of the device.  The kinetic drive has a vertical arrangement, according to the principle of "top".  These devices do not use the mechanical connection of the units but the electrical one. <br><br>  Schematic diagram: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/921/7f8/ddb/9217f8ddbbba02937abad410c7e63e8f.png"><br><br>  It looks like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7e1/647/19b/7e164719b2e704ae16d2bd63731a8983.jpg"><br><br>  Advantages: the kinetic accumulator can be installed separately from the power unit itself, the accumulator is placed in a sealed envelope filled with gas, thus the resistance is reduced, which allows to increase the autonomy time without starting the diesel. <br><br>  But photos of devices in reality (not in our data center): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d55/095/090/d5509509068013aac7060c2561576371.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/820/2c1/c0a/8202c1c0adba46738a7428d640f23bfe.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/339/eed/1ab/339eed1ab3d5644ee69149976f88b28b.jpg"><br><br>  <b>PS</b> This topic was promised in the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/beeline/blog/134961/">first about Yaroslavl data center</a> .  If you have other questions about the work of the data center - I will try to answer in the comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/139184/">https://habr.com/ru/post/139184/</a></p>
