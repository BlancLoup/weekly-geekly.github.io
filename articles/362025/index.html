But in spite of the value of this hydrocarbon raw material, the technology of production and transportation of oil implies the burning of a part of the gas dissolved in it.  This problem is inherent in all oil producers, so many are looking for efficient technologies for utilization of associated gas.  In this article we will analyze the most original approaches to its solution. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  What is the problem? </h2><br>  Oil, which is located in the depths of the Earth, is a rather cottony substance.  In the process of its production various drilling fluids, chemicals, surfactants are used.  The bowels of the Earth are cut by water layers, and the most problematic is gases dissolved in oil, the main of which is methane.  Older hydrocarbons, such as propane, butane, paraffins, are also dissolved in oil.  Oil requires thorough cleaning for its further transportation.  Therefore, on the way of pumping oil, there are special stations whose tasks are to ‚Äúbring‚Äù oil to strict export standards.  One of the objectives of the treatment plant (if not the main task) is to extract the gas dissolved in it from the oil.  This gas has nowhere to go, so the easiest way to dispose of it is simply burning. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ae3/2da/e8f/ae32dae8f4ca4c298bc0871eb1946d80.jpg"><br><br>  In principle, there is nothing wrong with the process of gas flaring.  I, as an ardent supporter of the truth of ecology, am even very pleased that in this way carbon is returned to the planetary biosystem through CO2 emissions.  Much worse is the uncontrolled release of methane - an extremely dangerous greenhouse gas that has been held in the atmosphere for many years and does not participate in the biological processes that the Planet needs.  <b>Methane must be burned!</b>  Of course, burning it in simple torches is simply not businesslike.  Any useful combustion of it, for example in a co-generator, is also useful for nature, because carbon dioxide is emitted in the same volume, but it can also produce electricity and heat.

    <h2>  How much gas is burned in Russia? </h2><br>  Surprisingly, no one knows the reliable information about the amount of gas burned.  There are only indicative estimates that differ significantly.  So, for example, according to the estimates of the ‚Äúspy‚Äù satellites, who are watching the burning Russian torches from the orbit of the Earth, about 60 billion cubic meters of gas per year are totally burned.  According to official estimates of environmentalists - about 13 billion.  According to oil companies, no more than 10 billion, and at one of the meetings, President Vladimir Putin announced a figure of 20 billion cubic meters.  And here is the curious data of the Accounts Chamber.  Thus, in 2009, according to her data, only seven major oil companies (Rosneft, Lukoil, TNK-BP, Gazprom Neft, Russneft, Bashneft and Slavneft) were burned in flares 19, 96 billion m¬≥ of associated petroleum gas, which accounted for <b>64.3% (!)</b> Of its total production.  In any case, even weighted average estimates show that in flares every year such amount of gas burns, which is comparable to the third (!) Volume of gas exports to Europe.  What to do with this huge resource, which does not bring any profit, and even eats extra money?  The question is still open. <br><br><h2>  Analysis of natural gas utilization technologies </h2><br>  Consider existing technologies for utilization of natural gas.  So, as this is my article, so I will express my opinion that all of them are practically unpromising.  But still. <br><br>  <b>Injection of associated gas back to Earth</b> <br>  This technology is trying to introduce some oil companies.  This method allows to increase the in-situ pressure, which increases the oil output from the well.  But it is for the time being.  All this is more out of despair, since the Government is going to significantly (dozens of times) raise the fines for burning gas.  At the same time, technology requires sophisticated equipment that is not produced in Russia.  Imported equipment is very expensive and requires additional staff qualifications.  Also, the disadvantages include the fact that this method is not applicable for small and scattered wells over a large area and can be somehow effectively applied only on very large fields. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fe9/efa/b3a/fe9efab3a5814f0dbdcbd42ea9b81022.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Associated gas supply to gas pipelines</b> <br>  It would seem that there is nothing easier to pump gas into the gas pipelines.  However, the gas pipe is not laid everywhere, and Gazprom makes very strict requirements for its cleaning.  Indeed, the gas needs to be divided into fractions, dry it (using methanol) and thereby prepare it for input into the mainline.  It is not yet known what is more expensive - to pay fines for burning or to clean the gas at the request of gas workers.  At the same time, the price of gas fully prepared for injection does not exceed $ 20-30 per 1000 m3, which in itself is very unprofitable, and emotionally not comfortable, since your gas will be sold at least ten times more expensive.  Well, these are emotions, but all the same ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f81/d6f/269/f81d6f2696bf41b39b0ff525d7cbea6e.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Receiving electric and thermal energy</b> <br>  There are no problems with this in the field.  Everything is flooded with light, everything is warm.  Only here the industrial production of electricity is meaningless.  How to transfer it to consumers?  Even if there are a number of power lines, it will not solve the problem.  Electricity and oil production are very different things.  To dock them on an industrial scale is very difficult. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/66e/1b4/f26/66e1b4f26cbb4942968ab2b31a0c1897.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Production of liquid motor fuels</b> <br>  Associated gas and enough energy - and here is the solution!  Synthesize liquid motor fuel.  However, this technology requires very serious chemical synthesis equipment.  Moreover, for industrial synthesis requires additional consumables.  But this does not solve the main problem - where to put the resulting substance?  The issue of transportation remains open.  In general, the technology is expensive and not profitable. <br><br>  There are a number of other technologies (gas condensate, methane hydride, etc.), which also do not fundamentally solve the problem of gas utilization.  New original approaches and technologies are needed that will allow looking at the problem from another point of view.  We will try to analyze them. <br><br><h2>  Search for original technologies for utilization of natural gas.  Brainstorm </h2><br>  Let's, as the physicists say, let's ramble the question. <br>  <b>What do we have?</b> <br><blockquote>  1. Gas, which has in its molecular composition carbon atom C and four hydrogen atoms H <br>  2. Gas is able to oxidize (burn) with the release of energy of the order of 39 MJ per 1 m3 <br>  3. Methane has a number of chemical <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25CC%25E5%25F2%25E0%25ED">properties</a> .  This should not be forgotten. <br></blockquote><br>  <b>What well?</b> <br><blockquote>  1. Strip a lot. <br>  2. Nowhere to go. </blockquote><br>  <b>What is wrong?</b> <br><blockquote>  1. Transport is not profitable. <br>  2. Burn expensive.  Fines, environmentalists, and not safe. </blockquote><br><br>  With these incoming data, the task was formulated to propose an original technology for the utilization of associated gas for four groups of students from one of the technical universities of Tomsk (5 people of the 4th year in each group).  Brainstorming was carried out for 1 hour.  Only one idea was required. <br><br>  The results of the assault were such.  In the first group they proposed to obtain carbon black for chemical production and rubber production, the second - to synthesize diamonds, since a lot of energy and diamonds can be easily brought to the mainland as very expensive raw materials, and the third group proposed producing methane hydride, creating solid methane lakes for future generations. <br><br>  Non-standard technology was offered by the participants of the fourth group.  The essence of their ideas is the unfolding of special containers in the fields, which are equipped with gas or fuel cell electricity generators, as well as powerful pulsed magnetrons capable of generating microwave radiation and directional antenna devices.  According to students, such installations could be configured into a network that could provide an original communication system, as well as be sources of super powerful electronic interference to ensure Russia's strategic security.  Also in the characteristics of such modules, the guys laid the function of collecting meteorological data and transmitting this information to satellites.  During the presentation, the idea was also sounded to utilize the associated gas in the form of pumping high-power lasers and transmit this energy to the satellite in the atmospheric transparency windows, which could redirect this energy to the required place, but they refused this idea. <br><br>  Indeed, if nothing has been done except burning in flares at the field, should it not be disposed of before electromagnetic interference?  Or maybe you, dear readers, have ideas on how to solve this problem?  Then please comment. <br><br>  Some post materials are taken from <a href="http://youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D0RxtNG8CWBc">this</a> video. <br>  Have a nice day, everyone! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/362025/">https://habr.com/ru/post/362025/</a></p>
