Now, he seems to be writing on a <a href="http://temalebedev.ya.ru/">blog</a> that has not yet been closed, although who knows, maybe there will be ‚Äúwell-wishers‚Äù here and close it.  Well-wishers as seen by famous people even a dime a dozen.  And the popularity of the laurels apparently some do not sleep.

        </script>
      <br>
      And it all started as I understood from a certain ‚Äúcomrade‚Äù, even more I would say ‚Äúcomrade‚Äù who actually filed a complaint with the CJS about Artemy allegedly producing child porn, <a href="">here you can also see this post</a> . <br><br>  I now wonder where the SUP found a nursery here, and especially pornography?  Or do some people already have a completely quiet roof and cannot distinguish erotica from pornography?  How did they know how old these tits are?  Looks like they accurately enough, clearly and carefully examined themselves to determine their age.  Let them read the encyclopedia of sex, for example, which one on the subject of determining erotica from pornography and let them write out the main differences. <br><br>  It is also interesting, I think many will take a look at the attempts of cheap excuses of the very <a href="http://val.zp.ua/blog/2008/06/10/158/">instigator of this story by a certain Val</a> who as I understood from Ukraine, Zaporozhye.  It is better to read that he writes about this.  Allegedly, in order to show and prove that the SUP and the actual LJ itself are such shitty, well, Anton Nosik is so unobtrusively mowed down on the arrows, allegedly he also covers other LJs. <br><br>  Here is his short quote: <br><br><blockquote>  "I bow to Tymen's dedication and hard work, but I could not miss such a case: leave LiveJournal" </blockquote><br><br>  As a matter of fact, who is he to decide for others, what to do and where to go?  Of course, I do myself, and I understand that LJ is not sugar, or more simply, in my opinion, ‚ÄúGavno is complete,‚Äù but people themselves choose where, how and what to do.  And to mine as he wrote ‚ÄúI bow down‚Äù it would be more correct to write ‚ÄúI envy‚Äù and envy you see much.  Yes, at the same time, he himself after this occasion, what a fucking PR, he fucked, probably almost everyone who read about the case of this, went to the site of the very originator of the ‚Äúcelebration‚Äù.  <strong>This is just personal PR, due to the black PR of someone else</strong> . <br><br>  Although Artemy, if he moves to another blog (bloghosting), he will lose the old old address of the diary and a considerable audience of friends.  Although on another blogger service, if there is an opportunity to make friends, in less than a couple of weeks I think there will be no less than friends, and in half a month the diary address itself will be no less recognizable than the old one. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/27236/">https://habr.com/ru/post/27236/</a></p>
