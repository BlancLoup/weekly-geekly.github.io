  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Completely non-original SSD on Macbook Air</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It so happened that two weeks after my Macbook Air 13 "ended Apple Care, SSD died. I didn‚Äôt want to go to the official representative, as well as to the left laboratories. I couldn‚Äôt get the repair price from the lab if it turns out that only the SSD really broke, and the problem was aggravated by the fact that I was not 100% sure that it was an SSD and not the motherboard, for example, so a surrogate from a known and not very brands, for example, OWC. Another difficulty was that  something Apple specifically does your devices so they are more difficult to repair, even to simply unscrew the cap had to ask a friend's set of screwdrivers, it is not surprising that we could not just take the first available SSD and check. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Fortunately, this threaded nut also had its own threaded bolt, namely an adapter, to use standard SSDs with a Macbook.  I stumbled upon it completely by chance and I think that very few people know about this possibility of replacing a disk, so I decided to tell about my experience here.  The experience lies in the fact that the adapter was ordered for $ 4 with aliexpress, on the second attempt, the Samsung SSD found itself lying around with a friend 128Gb, ‚Äã‚Äãwhich got up like a native.  Especially I didn‚Äôt measure productivity, but visually opening and installing programs was like in my own.  Gluck was not noticed either.  Trim mode was turned on manually, according to the instructions in <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/222077/how-to-enable-trim-for-third-party-ssds-on-mac-os-x/">this article</a> .  As a result, the repair cost much cheaper than if I bought a compatible surrogate disk or, especially, the original one. <br><br>  Keep in mind that there are adapters for different models of SSD and Macbooks, prices range from 4 to 20 dollars.  Sometimes the drive does not fit without any apparent reason, so if the drive does not start with one disc and the adapter is selected correctly, then try with another disc.  Choose very carefully, visually they are all very similar.  It is better to write to the seller your specific Macbook model, so as not to guess.  In my opinion, for $ 4 and $ 20 they sell the same adapters, the difference is only in the inscriptions on the board.  You can buy on Aliexpress, ebay, amazon, and there are sites that specialize in them.  A couple of photos, as it looks, at the end of the article (I apologize for the quality, was taken off the phone in a hurry).  I hope my experience will help someone. <br><br>  <b>P.S.</b>  I rarely write in Russian, if there are mistakes (and there are any), then please write to the PM, I will correct it.
