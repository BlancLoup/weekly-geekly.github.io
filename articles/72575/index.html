The anti-piracy association is trying to obtain compensation of 3.6 million euros from a private person, despite the fact that there is no direct evidence of copyright infringement, only a powerful flow of traffic, based on the statistics of the provider. <br><br>  Today, the Finnish Pirate Party has condemned the ‚Äúastronomical‚Äù lawsuit against the owner of the file sharing server.  The total amount of the claim is 5.4 million dollars. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The lawsuit affects the events of 2007, the case was filed by the Finnish anti-piracy association CIAPC (Copyright and Anti-Piracy Information Center), and it is directed against the owner of the server, known as BAWD Rinkeli.  The respondent who lives in Espoo claims that he used the server to communicate with other Internet users, and no copyrighted material was ever transmitted through it.

      The anti-piracy association, acting on behalf of <a href="">Teosto</a> (an organization for the protection of performers, helping Finnish composers and songwriters to receive their due royalties) and the IFPI (International Phonogram Manufacturers Federation), demands direct compensation for losses incurred from an individual. <br><br>  ‚ÄúDemanding such a huge amount, the fighters against pirates, it seems, are not even going to get anything,‚Äù the Pirate Party said. ‚ÄúTheir only intention is to turn the life of the accused into a nightmare so that he becomes a terrifying example for other people.‚Äù <br><br>  The pirate party claims that the anti-piracy association is still not able to provide at least some convincing evidence of illegal activities in which the owner of the server is allegedly implicated.  Instead, they point to powerful streams of traffic passing through his server, considering this to be proof of crime. <br><br>  ‚ÄúCIAPC only supports its charges with data on the large amount of traffic generated by the user.  They are not able to provide any more evidence, ‚Äùsaid the Pirate Party,‚Äú With only this information, they have the right to claim that they suffered losses of several million dollars when the international scientific community could not confirm these losses even after much more careful studying the data? " <br><br>  The head of the party, Pazi Palmulehto, stated that he himself used his computer as a file-sharing server in his own time, and the data on the generated traffic does not mean anything by itself.  According to him, even with simple communication, you can fully download megabit channel. <br><br>  There is no direct file sharing through such servers; they work according to a scheme that is very similar to the way torrent resources work, that is, file sharing is done between users.  All such servers work this way: users make their materials visible and accessible for sharing with other users.  Although theoretically the owner of the server can do the same, this is prohibited. <br><br>  ‚ÄúNo one can claim compensation from one person for what completely different people have done,‚Äù the defendant told the Finnish press. <br><br>  <b>Posted on</b> Oct 15, 2009 <br>  <b>Posted by</b> : Enigmax <br>  <b>Translation</b> : <a href="http://www.nnm-club.ru/forum/viewtopic.php%3Ft%3D146506">Talim</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/72575/">https://habr.com/ru/post/72575/</a></p>
