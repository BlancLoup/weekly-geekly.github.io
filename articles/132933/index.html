In this article I will try to tell you in more detail about how I consider it right to put goals on a life path, that is, I will understand in more detail what ‚Äúright work‚Äù is. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  About karma </h4><br>  Surely, every Russian IT specialist, having heard the word ‚ÄúKarma‚Äù, first of all associates it with Habrahabr.  For example, I, writing a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/robot/132830/">previous article</a> , spoiled karma, because  too rude and critical of the described invention, while any new advances are extremely important for modern robotics.  As Jesus said, according to Matthew, ch. 7, v. 1 - ‚ÄúDo not judge, you will not be judged.‚Äù  This he, of course, was not talking about robots, but nonetheless. <br><br>  In general, in various Eastern religions, karma is the simplest element of a causal effect that governs all existence.  The Buddha formulated it a little more precisely, understanding by karma any <b>conscious</b> action, because it somehow affects the future path.  I considered it necessary to say about karma, rather, in the form of a small remark in the fields, just so as not to forget, because  I will sometimes mention it further.  Habr is not a philosophical circle, so let's move to a more mundane level. <br><br><h4>  Superglobal goals </h4><br><img align="right" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/deb9ee83/cbd65484/3459851b/322d7719.jpg">  I want to make a reservation right away that the term ‚Äúsuperglobal goal‚Äù is my own wording, I specifically google it now to make sure that there are no conflicts with other interpretations.  In traditional terminology, the notion of ‚Äúmission‚Äù most closely matches this, and one of the most vivid examples was the well-known multi-hero: ‚ÄúKill all humans!‚Äù

      <br>
      Superglobal goal can not be achieved in practice, despite the fact that it is always quite specific, has certain final points and necessarily indicates the direction of achievement.  For example, ‚ÄúTo kill all humans!‚Äù Is a good example of a goal, because hypothetically it has an end - if you start killing people one by one, then sooner or later they will end.  But ‚ÄúWorld Peace!‚Äù Is a bad example, because there is no specifics in it: What is meant by ‚Äúpeace‚Äù?  Land?  Universe?  What is ‚Äúpeace‚Äù?  No wars?  If peace means peace, enlightenment, Zen, then the goal becomes a little better, but still full of understatement. <br><br><h4>  Correct goals </h4><br>  How to choose the right goals in life?  What requirements should they meet?  Different religions and philosophies teach very similar sets of haram, commandments, rules from noble truths ... Each named them in his own way.  In fact, if you leave the baby on a deserted island and give him time to grow up and think, then most likely he would come to about the same truths on his own experience.  That is why I consider it extremely important to develop and realize my own set of rules on my own. <br><br>  When I, as a young man, started forming my worldview, karma was for me something of an unconscious regulator that influences the choice of further actions.  Actually, this is very persistent, reinforcing each with their own horror stories, and teaching religion.  Today, I no longer think about karma in the wording: ‚ÄúI will miss the old woman <b>not at the</b> pedestrian crossing - I will get a plus sign‚Äù, but this method works fine at the beginning of the path when you need to learn how to control your feelings.  In general, Moscow traffic jams are an excellent simulator on the way to enlightenment. <br><br>  For me, as for a person who lives without short-term goals at all (you can read in more detail in <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/gtd/129884/">one of the previous articles</a> ), it is critically important to understand that my actions correspond to my mission, my way.  I could not afford to do the work simply because I would have a short-term goal to buy a new stroller for the child, and I need to earn money for it. <br><br>  I am sure that many of you, when making certain decisions, for example, getting a new job, also look far beyond just the salary, the softness of the chairs and the goodness of the buns in the dining room.  And even not only on the fascination of the process itself, of writing code / script / technical specifications.  You may know the feeling when you are sincerely imbued with the idea, the mission of the company, when you do the work, believing that you are building the future with your own hands.  Agree that such work is correct! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/e61b1395/7804c893/19887bb9/01ee0ae7.jpeg"><br><br><h4>  Life example </h4><br>  Of course, I will not draw any conclusions about how karma care should influence the choice of one or another superglobal goals.  I have already said that everyone will have to choose and realize independently, however, I will give a small example from my life today that might inspire you. <br><br>  Feeling that the idea for which I worked for one of my employers for more than a year, was dissolved, and the company's mission was reduced to making money, I left without thinking.  I must admit that this was the way I did with all previous employers, but that‚Äôs not the point.  I had a very good business idea that I had been working on for a long time in far-distant West Africa.  I want to ask in advance not to go into comments in business discussions - this is just an example.  My mission is to build houses using the latest technologies for semi-wild Aborigines, to bring them warmth and comfort, stimulating healthy competition and development.  I went there for more than a month to explore, leaving the young wife to be sad at home.  We both understood that this goal was correct. <br><br>  However, the story is not about that.  Returning to Moscow, without a second thought, I shared the idea and details with the man who later opened the way for me to my current employer.  You will not believe it, but now my mission is no less noble: to stimulate production in the equally wild Latin America, albeit at a higher level. <br><br>  This can be viewed simply as an example of a successful set of circumstances, but I know that this is nothing more than a chain of interdependent causes and effects. <br><br><h4>  At last </h4><br>  I am not going to preach any religion or sectarianism, monastic way of life or <i>blackjack with whores (c)</i> .  Simply, if you think that something for which you should live cannot be compared with the apartment on Arbat or the new Jaguar XKR-S, then do not be afraid to set your priorities, focusing on superglobal goals. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/132933/">https://habr.com/ru/post/132933/</a></p>
