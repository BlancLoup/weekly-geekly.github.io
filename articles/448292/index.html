The new service should solve several problems at once for those who often send (and especially - receive) money through the p2p translation.  Firstly, we opened up opportunities previously available only for business, and tried to make the process safe, fast and convenient, and secondly, we want to remove the risks of the form ‚ÄúI was paid for my work and the bank got paid off.‚Äù <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0l/er/o9/0lero9ffaxa4lcdffdgc9v5f9fo.png" width="400"></div><br>  Why all this in general and how exactly we did it, and also about the opportunity to receive from us up to 3 million rubles within the QIWI Universe - under the cut. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Why p2p translations are important </h2><br>  People often throw money at each other through transfers from card to card or by phone number - the essence is one, it is a direct payment from one physical person to another.  It can be a refund, if you bought a friend a coffee, when he didn‚Äôt have money with him (or a desire to pay for coffee), it could be an open fundraising for something, it could be some kind of ice cream kiosk or The same coffee in the park, where the seller accepts only cash, but there is an opportunity and "throw on sber."

      A separate line here and pass self-employed citizens.  Suppose a person receives a steady income for some kind of freelancing (or rents an apartment, for example) and wants to legalize his income.  Not everyone wants to do IP, so the state took care of the self-employed.  Apparently, in the format of open beta, because the initiative itself, like tax rates, is reasonable, but practice shows that some of the first swallows faced arbitrary blocking of the main bank accounts.  It is sometimes difficult for a bank to draw a dividing line between the receipt of funds by such a self-employed citizen within his professional activities and ordinary remittances.  Therefore, just in case, the bank will first block everything, and then understand what is there and how. <br><br>  We will not discuss this matter, we decided to just come up with an alternative. <br><br>  It turns out that de facto people have the request to accept payments in similar ways.  And the state has a request for the legalization of this whole business, so that such people can work in white and pay taxes.  It was in these two stories that we wanted to participate. <br><br>  In that year, we created a <a href="https://developer.qiwi.com/ru/bill-payments/">universal protocol</a> for receiving funds, which successfully combined all available payment methods - acquiring wallet, bank cards, mobile commerce, installments according to conscience, I wrote about it <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/qiwi/blog/432100/">here</a> .  Of course, SDK and support were made for him in various CMS.  Therefore, in the solution for the example, p2p translations decided to use it.  Such an approach will allow the client without technological changes to go from rare translations and self-employment to his company. <br><br>  We started with custom tests to understand how people perceive form.  The main thing here is for them to understand that using the form is the transfer of funds, and not the purchase of a service.  Because a person can use a credit card for this.  And if the online purchase from a credit card is considered by the bank as a purchase and is not subject to a commission, then there is usually a commission when transferring from a credit card to another card.  And for some banks it reaches such a value that when you return money to a friend for a coffee, you give two such coffee servings to a jar.  Which is always sad, and sometimes even suddenly. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hf/93/1o/hf931ondtalpb1tvoqipjzdkslu.jpeg"><br><br>  Therefore, we immediately replaced the ‚ÄúPay‚Äù button with an unambiguous ‚ÄúTransfer‚Äù, in order to weed out doubts and make the user understand that on our part everything is transparent and without commissions, but a commission from the bank that issued the card itself is possible. <br><br>  We looked deeper into how users interact with the form.  Understand that it is still important for a person to see in the form of transfer who exactly he transfers money to (people are used to transferring by phone number or full name from contacts in a smartphone).  But to show the surname as a whole in a public form is a so-called idea, therefore we show the name and the first letter of the name. <br><br>  Speaking of security.  Why is it better not to show a direct phone on forms and widgets for fundraising and why do we hide it?  First, through the phone number itself, they can try to break the wallet, try to recover the SIM card in the cabin, etc., that is, there is a target attack factor on the subscriber and wallet.  No number - no factor.  And secondly, it also helps from various kinds of deer, which collect on the network up-to-date mobile phone numbers for calling and offering various services and other nonsense. <br><br>  And now it turns out that the translation is carried out either by a short link, or from a widget on the site, or from a QR code. <br><br>  We immediately laid down for p2p hiding the phone number.  People could previously collect funds in different ways - the card number, QIWI Wallet number, etc., and we combined them all. <br><br><h2>  What is all spinning </h2><br>  We were able to successfully adapt the <a href="https://developer.qiwi.com/ru/bill-payments/">payment protocol</a> made for business to a transfer solution, while retaining all the features and compatibility with libraries.  Now anyone with an identified wallet can log in and access all this good.  Now physical  persons are not available only returns, but they are in the plans and not so in demand. <br><br>  All this can be viewed in the work on <a href="https://p2p.qiwi.com/">p2p.qiwi.com</a> <br><br>  When you log in with your wallet, you‚Äôll see your personal short link.  For example, <a href="https://my.qiwi.com/gkonnov">my.qiwi.com/gkonnov</a> .  It is convenient both to send in a message, and, for example, make a QR code.  The form adapts well to mobile devices, so the conversion will be good.  There will also be personal widgets to choose from ( <a href="https://widget.qiwi.com/gkonnov">widget.qiwi.com/gkonnov</a> ).  They were made for websites and blogs.  On the widgets and the form, you can customize to match the design of your website or brand.  It was all in the possibilities for big business and large stores - we moved everything and to users. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/my/af/-1/myaf-13rp4df8owleexhsbfr9xk.png" width="900"><br><br>  And there was an opportunity to invoice for services rendered.  You made a website for someone and you want to take money for the work - you drive in the necessary amount, create a link to the account, send it to the customer.  The customer goes over it and understands who he is translating and for what. <br><br>  Because  under the hood, a full-fledged API - you can create keys, set up the necessary notifications, connect it to your online store on <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/woo-qiwi-payment-gateway/">Wordpress</a> and other CMS, everything works. <br><br><h2>  So, what about you self-employed? </h2><br>  Now the self-employed have such a situation that they need to register on one service, then accept money on a card, which the bank can easily blot out (because you accept money from a lot of different people, yes, this is rarely the case with regular customers), and you issue checks in the third application.  And such a zoo in business, even if small and very small, is still unnerving. <br><br>  Yes, in general, nothing prevents you from using p2p.qiwi.com right now and, if you are self-employed, register your income in the <a href="https://lknpd.nalog.ru/auth/login">‚ÄúMy Tax‚Äù service</a> , but right now we are actively interacting with the FTS and integrating their API, which will allow registering self-employed, and keep records of their activities.  In general, a person will receive a boxed solution that will have to cover all his needs as a self-employed person. <br><br>  At the same time, knowing the scope of the client‚Äôs activity, we will be able to expand limits, reduce the risk of blocking and offer convenient services that will make legal work not so much a duty as an advantageous opportunity. <br><br>  Therefore, in addition to <a href="https://p2p.qiwi.com/">p2p.qiwi.com,</a> we launched <a href="https://universe.qiwi.com/">QIWI Universe 2019</a> . <br><br>  Here we offer teams who want to write some useful service for the self-employed, work together with us, launch a pilot and receive up to 3 million rubles, depending on the result.  Details, requirements for teams and evaluation conditions <a href="https://universe.qiwi.com/sam/">here</a> .  Already operating companies this also applies.  We are open to cooperation on the adaptation of services for the self-employed, these projects can also be submitted to the <a href="https://universe.qiwi.com/">QIWI Universe.</a> <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iywLYCwJCbk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  What it can be - you can think of a service that will help collect funds for street photographers, musicians, creators of useful webinars, people who rent apartments, in general, there can be many scenarios. <br><br>  The main focus is self-employed.  That we should help them by launching the product.  I sincerely believe that this is a great opportunity to help people, companies and the state in a new, huge market.  Any questions?  <a href="https://universe.qiwi.com/sam/">Sign up</a> for the webinar on April 24 or ask in the comments. <br><br>  If the topic of self-employed is not very close to you, <a href="https://universe.qiwi.com/">check out any</a> of the 8 projects on QIWI Universe 2019. They are different. <br><br>  Yes, by the way, on April 18, we are also conducting a <a href="https://qiwi-events.timepad.ru/event/944117/">developer mitt</a> , come, we will be happy. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/448292/">https://habr.com/ru/post/448292/</a></p>
