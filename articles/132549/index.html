    <h5>  Introduction </h5><br>  For about 10 years we have been working on desktop products for analyzing the stock market.  These are the most complex trading and analytical terminals that allow you to display stock information, process it, analyze the results, optimize them for the necessary parameters and send an order to the broker depending on the decision made.  The development of such solutions takes years, which forms a high cost of the product for the end user. <br><br>  Based on our experience, we decided to try an alternative business model, and launch a startup that is accessible and free to a wide audience. <br><br><h5>  Functionality </h5><br>  The main tool of TradingView is the reel-time charting, the <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/features/">functionality of which is</a> not inferior to the leading desktop platforms.  You can get tick-by-tick real-time data on forex, US stocks and indices, use a wide range of technical analysis tools and access the platform from any computer with a browser. <br><br>  Any chart can be <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/s/%3Fq%3D%26sort%3Ddate">published to the gallery</a> as an idea for discussion with other traders, which at the same time allows you to use other people's ideas in your work.  So, if you are trading Microsoft shares (MSFT), you can simultaneously track what the users of TradingView think about this. <br><br>  The published chart can be borrowed in the IFRAME format to any web resource, so users can easily post their ideas in blogs or forums.  Additionally, we provide a <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/widget/">free widget</a> that anyone can use on their website. <br><br><h5>  Business model </h5><br>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa portal business model is not new.  We want to create a free and affordable tool for a wide audience, and then monetize traffic.  There can be a lot of way to monetize, now it‚Äôs too early to think about it, at least until we grow up to 10-15 thousand unique visits per day.  At the moment, the Google analytics chart is as follows: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dea/271/051/dea2710513c594c056f59bd9ada02d65.png" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  Future development </h5><br>  At the moment we are working on connecting futures and as far as possible we will connect new exchanges.  With great pleasure, we would give out quotes from the RTS, but unfortunately, according to their conditions, each user must pay exchange fees, which contradicts the format of our service.  We are ready to pay a monthly fee to connect to the server quotes, but we are not ready to pay for each user, because we simply do not track their number. <br><br>  In the near future, we will be engaged in the development of a tool that has been tested before us only in university research papers.  Its essence is to help traders predict future price movements based on twitter activity.  On this topic, we will definitely make a separate post. <br><br><h5>  Technology </h5><br>  From the point of view of technology, the project was absolutely new for us.  All developers had a solid experience with language languages ‚Äã‚Äã(C ++, some sharps and java), but there was almost no web development experience.  After a series of experiments, we stopped at Django for the portal itself and Erlang for processing and relaying exchange data.  The client part is implemented on HTML5 with the requirement for support of Canvas and WebSocket, therefore, outdated browsers are not supported (for example, IE8, where the canvas is missing).  For full-text search we use Sphinx, as a DBMS - PostrgeSQL. <br><br><h5>  Goals of the post </h5><br>  Naturally, the main goal is to draw attention to our startup and get as much feedback as possible to improve it.  However, this is our first post on the Habr√©, which, according to the idea, was not going to be very long and at the same time describe the project from different angles.  Therefore, none of the sections does not disclose details, although it may well qualify for a separate post.  Depending on the quality of comments, we will decide on the continuation of publications. <br><br><h5>  About Us </h5><br>  We deliberately avoided mentioning the company name or other details.  If this information is not perceived as an advertisement, about this we can make a separate photo-post. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/132549/">https://habr.com/ru/post/132549/</a></p>
