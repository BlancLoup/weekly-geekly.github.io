  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Entertainment industry and sausage cheese</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Tell me honestly - are you not bothered to listen to endless debates about copyright, or even participate in them?  Not?  Well, then I offer a little more information to think about, and at the same time a topic for debate.  I beg your pardon, polemics. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Sausage cheese is an extremely complex thing.  So you think it lies on a shelf, then it is bought and eaten?  Not so simple.  First, before he finds himself on the store shelf, he has a long way to go, from the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe master cheese-maker (or even some food designer) to the complicated process of setting up production.  Someone put his thoughts, soul, heart (in the worst case) into this cheese.  And you stupidly eat it.  Well, and secondly, they sell you not cheese, but the rights to its temporary use.  Do not eat on time - spoil and have to throw.  Eat - well ... also in some sense, throw it away.  Most of it.  After all, no one sells "fats, proteins, carbohydrates, inorganic components and a small amount of water," that is, what will be absorbed by your body.  Sell ‚Äã‚Äãcheese. <br>  And in fact that is characteristic, no one is trying to sell uncle Van, who lives in Uryupinsk, the cheese of the same brand and for the same price that its glamorous designer Andrei from Moscow buys.  Because the differentiation of the color of pants. <br>  And the most important thing - cheese sellers make sure that this cheese gets to everyone.  And to the designer, and to Uncle Van.  Not cheese makers, mind you, namely sellers.  Although anything happens.  But they are driving to the very depths of the wagon with cheese, building cheese department stores there and tormenting us with our confused accounting system so that Uncle Vanya could pay for this valuable product with greasy pieces of paper and coins rather than using a high-tech payment system with a dozen middlemen, although the latter are sellers it would be much more convenient. <br><br>  And now we turn to the suppliers of "spiritual food."  And let us ask ourselves a strange question - why, in fact, are there no similar processes going on there?  Why should buyers (well, or content generators) have to make sure that the product reaches its goal?  Just because audio cd, unlike cheese, does not spoil in a couple of days or weeks? <br>  For some reason, it seems to me that in order to demand the national execution of <s>marital</s> consumer debt, content sellers must first provide service at the same level as sausage cheese sellers.  Because in terms of the need for ordinary people, these two types of products are almost equal.  Modern people are not going anywhere from music and movies, as these are the two main types of information they absorb.  Without them, they just can not really exist, as without fats, proteins, carbohydrates, and so on.  Accordingly, if the purchase of content will create less problems than the ‚Äútheft‚Äù, they will buy.  Nowhere not going anywhere.  Just as it is now easier to buy food in a store than to steal it or grow it yourself.

      But the question of how exactly the service should be is much more complicated.  Not like now, that's for sure.  It's easier for me to turn on Internet radio, regular radio, and in the end a torrent client, than to go to the only sensible store in the city and hope that there will be a disk of the artist I need.  Then I have to go home, insert the disc into the drive, rob music into mp3, upload it to the player ... OK, try another way.  Itunes Music Store.  We go, register, enter credit cards ... oh, sorry, first we go to the bank, register a credit card, wait for it to be issued (fortunately, unembossed can now be received instantly), put money on it, go back home, pray that this very credit card will accept this the store itself ... Yes, and the prices for music, which do not vary depending on the region, are too high for Russia as a whole.  Music is bread, not an expensive collection wine, remember this.  Okay, last option.  We go to a certain abstract made-up site, we see there the inscription ‚Äúsend an SMS to a short number to pay for the licensed version of the song‚Äù, we send it, we wait for a response with a password.  Perhaps the answer will even come, and SMS will cost exactly 10 rubles with VAT, and not 50 without, plus another 300 - "VAT" (that's a mysterious tax, right?).  Downloading the long-awaited mp3 shku.  So, now our task is to explain to the appeared ‚Äúmask show‚Äù that all the content on your hard drive was taken from this site, and not stupidly downloaded from torrents and then interrupted by tags. <br><br>  Complicated?  And no one said it would be easy.  So what should be the system for selling licensed music or video, so that both buyers and sellers are satisfied?  And preferably also the authors.  Your opinion? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/64157/">https://habr.com/ru/post/64157/</a></p>
