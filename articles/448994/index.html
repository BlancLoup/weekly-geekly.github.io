    <a name="habracut"></a>  Recruitment, like any other activity in working with people, requires a full understanding of this area, tools and values ‚Äã‚Äãfor the business as a whole.  Many at the start of his career do not give themselves an account of how difficult this is at the same time a difficult and interesting profession.  Because of this, in the last 6 years, we have a certain recession and a shortage of high-quality specialists.  Let's be honest.  After all, many people think that the personnel manager / recruiter is a kind of lover to take out the brain, inflating his lips and pathetically mocking the candidates.  This is such a vision from the applicant.  Future recruiters think that the business: to find, call, bring and voila - magic, it's done.  In practice, both are mistaken. <br><br>  The process of recruiting, and in the future of management, is very laborious, with a lot of pitfalls and surprises, where one cannot rely on stereotypedness. <br><br>  Therefore, today we have angry responses from applicants, especially IT-people.  Due to the fact that the profession of a recruiter is 80% female, this also adds its own ‚Äúcharm‚Äù and adds fuel to the fire. <br><br>  With the popularization of IT in the CIS countries, panic began in recruiting.  All sharply rushed into this cherished niche, as in mining at the time.  Naturally, I do not want to offend the female half of the Habr, but girls find it harder to understand all the subtleties of the IT field and the selection of specialists in it.  That's where it started.  ‚ÄúHow difficult it is,‚Äù ‚Äúgo to the webinar,‚Äù ‚Äúhow to get into IT,‚Äù and in the same vein. <br>  Yes, a niche is not easy.  To pick up a high-quality IT person is not to close the vacancy of a sales person or accountant, where everything is very clear.  Here it is necessary to turn on the brain to the full and not just check the paper with the profile of the position, but also have at least some understanding of the field of development and programming. <br><br>  And it begins ... The lost "divas" of recruiting, who managed to grab the thread and fill the hand, inflate their lips and turn on the regime of the lady.  All the rest, fight like fish in the ice, attending dozens of courses that "really help" in future activities.  And so not only in IT guys, so around.  We now have a century of trainings, courses, lectures, webinars and other things.  The knowledge behind them is not worn, but of all the garbage of these pseudo-teachings, only 20-30% of good material.  It is a pity that not everyone can distinguish it. <br><br>  So we have a recruiter who picked up the water, understood / did not understand and fight.  And so it began: <br><br><ul><li>  straight-line approach (on the forehead); </li><li>  complete lack of logic in the choice of places to search for IT-Schnick; </li><li>  dry reading of post profile; </li><li>  confusion in the subtleties and specifics of specific positions; </li><li>  spoiled phone and arrogance when communicating due to complexes of the above factors. </li></ul><br>  And these are just basic things. <br><br>  The <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/442598/"><b><u>article</u></b></a> that prompted me to write this material mentioned: Do we need recruiters / HR managers / headhunters?  Like, in times of sites such as dou and djinni, every IT person can find what he wants.  And I will answer you: of course, we need them, but sensible.  The best of the best, but not yesterday's line makers, who today have open spaces for midl and seniors. <br>  A competent specialist, even if he is a mediator, will never be superfluous.  It will save time and money for both the Customer and the applicant. <br><br>  In summary, I want to say: the devil is not so terrible as he is painted, but you have to be aware of what you are doing.  Starting from 2017, the trends that in the future, selection is automated, and manual recruiting will disappear.  Last year, I resorted to the services of one leading (according to them) organization that tried to select personnel automatically.  When the attempts to cooperate with them had to stop (the vacancy was simple and closed according to the classics), I realized that the era of automating the selection processes would come to us not soon. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/448994/">https://habr.com/ru/post/448994/</a></p>
