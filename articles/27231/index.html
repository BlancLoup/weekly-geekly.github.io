The world of IT is changing.  In the wake of the rise, social computer technologies are slowly being introduced into the business world, which we used to collectively call Web 2.0 technologies and which include various kinds of wikis, blogs, social networks, RSS and so on.  There is a new project, the name of which is Enterprise 2.0, and this is not at all an empty sound.  Next week there will be a <a href="http://www.enterprise2conf.com/">conference</a> dedicated to this topic. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/8c3/388/b4f/8c3388b4fabe9145e0624d6025cef5e5.png" width="161" height="195" hspace="10" vspace="10">

      According to the website <a href="http://dirti.ru/">News of Web Services and Social Networks</a> , the project involves not just introducing new socially oriented software into the boring and monotonous world of business, it is also proposed: modification of software that migrates from data centers to a network, development of staff mobility, the revival of "thin clients", users who themselves will offer the use of the services they need, and much more. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <strong>System Administrator.</strong>  <strong>Version 2.0.</strong> <br><br>  All this is just a plan, but you have the opportunity to observe how everything will gradually change right before your eyes.  Today, they still continue to hire classical system administrators in the IT department, but very soon it will all be in the past.  Don't misunderstand: a good engineer is always in demand, but future IT leaders are those who will manage the business with a computer, who will work closely with the executive director to implement the chosen tactics and direction of the company using information technologies - more there will not be those whom we used to call "sysadmins."  You understand perfectly well whom I mean: this is a typical introvert who is more accustomed to be constantly in front of a computer screen than to communicate with humanity.  A person who speaks abbreviations that are understandable only to him, which can perform any task by typing a few characters on the command line.  Such people are an endangered species: at least, they will soon have to make a lot of efforts to find such in the office. <br><br>  Today‚Äôs sysadmins will be replaced by real team fighters who have nothing to do with that mysterious figure hiding behind a screen, appearing only when something stops working. <br><br>  <strong>Enterprise 2.0.</strong> <br><br>  No, the director will not come to you with the news like: ‚ÄúListen, I was thinking here, but would it be possible for us to install Enterprise 2.0 software?‚Äù - these people will never say that, we all understand this perfectly, and hardly ever the situation will change.  A good IT specialist will always understand a negligent user and solve his problem, even if the user is not able to explain what he really needs.  Most likely, we will hear something like the following: ‚ÄúNewsletter via e-mail is outdated - in this regard, I would like to offer you a more convenient way to communicate with consumers of our services‚Äù - or - ‚ÄúI think there is an easier way to keep up to date industry news ", - or -" Oh, how many versions of the same documents in our corporate network, do not you think so? ".  Today's sysadmin will mumble something incomprehensible, and an IT 2.0 specialist knows which words to say: ‚ÄúBlog!  RSS!  Vicky! " <br><br>  And it's not just the knowledge of terminology, today you have a choice of platform to recommend - whether you will increase the investment in SharePoint, which already includes a significant number of Web 2.0 tools, or choose a solution that will take into account your personal wishes.  These are the questions that the new generation of system administrators will have to answer.  Yes, naturally, they will have to have certain professional skills, but there is a huge difference between the fact that a person will simply be able to determine the maximum packet size in Windows and that, in addition to this, will be able to answer the question about which we spoke earlier. <br><br>  <strong>Network Services</strong> <br><br>  IT 2.0 means the integration of computers into a network.  If now the servers are located in special rooms and are protected by brandmaurers, then in the near future the place of their deployment will change.  For example, Microsoft is going to offer hosting services to users of many of its products, like Exchange, BizTalk, SQL, SharePoint, and so on.  A test version <a href="http://www.mosbeta.com/">of Microsoft's online services is</a> already under development, and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/billg/speeches/2008/06-03teched.mspx">Bill Gates talks about the future</a> in which millions of servers will live in Microsoft data centers. <br><br>  And this is only one of the possible paths of development.  Google is also closely following the world of business.  Initially, there was just a simple offer for an easy-to-use but fast-growing office web package that could be easily installed at minimal cost, then Google apps for your domain were added, and the admin panel and security settings ended up with <a href="http://sites.google.com/">Google Sites</a> for team interaction and Google Web Security for Enterprise.  They are well aware that the niche of web applications is now empty, and they can safely take it and create competition in the constantly evolving computer world.  Microsoft and Google are world-renowned companies, but they are only the tip of the iceberg of network computing.  There are still numerous SaaS offers from <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services</a> .  An IT 2.0 user should know not only which software is best suited for the company in which he works, but also whether it will work if there is a brandmauer, on the network or on a network protected by the brandmauer. <br><br>  <strong>Mobile staff.</strong> <br><br>  Mobile staff will not be limited.  With the almost ubiquitous spread of broadband access and the ever-growing number of workers from generation Y, mobility will become the norm rather than the exception to the rule.  Mobility, which we are accustomed to regard as the prerogative of staff who are constantly on the road, today will be available to almost everyone.  Work at home will no longer be a privilege, but a necessity. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/c58/201/ea1/c58201ea1872e7fb381fb59f25dfe01d.jpg" width="226" height="169" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  IT departments will now have to choose those solutions that will meet the requirements of the new workforce - staff who almost always connect to the corporate network not at the workplace, but using unprotected Wi-Fi in a local cafe or home wireless network.  An IT specialist must find a way to provide users with and install updates and patches on their equipment that are necessary to protect corporate information, even if these users never use remote access.  In addition, an IT professional should make sure that in case of theft of, say, a corporate laptop full of important data, this information does not fall into the hands of intruders or competitors.  Many companies are already using virtualization to solve this problem.  The user gets access only to a kind of computer.  All important information is stored on the server.  Welcome back to the era of thin network computing. <br><br>  <strong>Users provide themselves with everything they need.</strong> <br><br>  This approach, duplicating Forrester research's Tech Populisim, is aimed at a new base of tech-savvy users.  As soon as generation X leaves and gives up its place to generation Y, IT departments will have to deal with employees, in whose life high technologies take not the last place, and who are not afraid to be inventive in their work.  Internal corporate website is quick and contains a lot of mistakes?  It does not matter - they will create their own on Google Sites, Microsoft Live Workspace, Dasecamp or any other similar service that helps to organize collective work.  File too large to email?  Do not worry, it will be posted on Box.net, Google Docs, Zoho, SkyDrive - any of the file storages, which is familiar to work with.  Those of IT professionals who prefer to turn a blind eye to all this, in the near future will be confronted with the fact that confidential data of the corporate network will be protected only by the well-known password "FIDO". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/f06/305/dd8/f06305dd863447ac6dfbf09e159e8bd1.png" width="297" height="238" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  What should a poor system administrator do?  After all, he can not completely turn off the Internet, no matter how hard he tried.  Instead, an IT professional should be part of a common cause - a large part of a common cause - and foresee everything that company employees may need.  The whole trick is to develop, install on computers and make popular its solution, which is so easy to use among staff, while this solution will protect corporate data, because now employees will not need to use third-party services. <br><br>  <strong>Conclusion</strong> <br><br>  All these changes will lead to the fact that future system administrators, even remotely, will not resemble today's ones.  Huge demand will be those who, in addition to technical education, will have the skills to implement IT 2.0, but there are few such people.  People who simply maintain a computer network in the office, being engaged only in its technical component, will be left out.  Now they will move to data centers and, already there, will be engaged in the technical side of the issue.  In the offices there will be sociable, shared IT problems with IT assistants who will get Enterprise 2.0 working. <br>  Google bookmarks </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/27231/">https://habr.com/ru/post/27231/</a></p>
