The Ministry of Communications has prepared a corresponding <a href="http://regulation.gov.ru/projects">project</a> . <br><br>  The ministry proposes a mechanism of 15 percent preferences for procurement (competitions, auctions, quotations requests) of state-owned companies, state corporations and natural monopolies, the document says. <br><br>  The exemption, as conceived by the Ministry of Communications and Mass Media, should extend to the purchase of 22 product items.  Among them are electronic computers and communication equipment, monitors and projectors, automatic data processing devices and application and system software (software), IT services, as well as services for the production of computers and so on. <a name="habracut"></a>

      If the state-owned company holds an auction, in case the supplier wins with foreign goods or services (from the list specified in the draft document), the state customer will enter into an agreement with him for an amount 15% less than the supplier‚Äôs final offer, <a href="http://www.rbc.ru/rbcfreenews/567c2d9e9a7947f4bd5da547">explained</a> RBC Deputy Communications Minister Mikhail Evraev. <br><br>  If suppliers of goods or services of Russian and foreign origin who have offered the same price participate in the competition, then at the bidding stage 15% are ‚Äúvirtually taken away‚Äù from the offer of the domestic company.  Thus, the chances of a domestic company to win the competition are increased.  But the contract with her in case of victory will be concluded at the price that the company initially offered (that is, without a 15 percent "discount"), he adds. <br><br>  The Russian origin of the goods will be determined in the same way as for the 44-FZ, according to which procurement authorities and budget institutions carry out, explains Evraev.  The initiative authors plan that the document will come into force in May 2016. <br><br>  <a href="https://roem.ru/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/importozameshenie.po.3.chtenie.doc">The law</a> obliging state agencies to submit a written argument for the purchase of foreign software from January 1, 2016 was signed by Russian President Vladimir Putin at the end of June. <br><br>  From January 1, 2016, the state customer will have to argue his choice in favor of foreign software, if his Russian counterparts in a specially created registry of domestic software.  The software should belong to the state, the municipality, a Russian non-profit organization or company with a share of Russian beneficiaries of more than 50% - this is the main criterion that makes it possible to consider software as domestic. <br><br>  ‚ÄúFederal authorities spend on IT services, software licenses are approximately 80 billion rubles annually.  With the money of Russian taxpayers should be purchased domestic products.  In the future, this practice should be extended to state-owned companies that have even larger IT budgets, ‚Äùsaid Nikolai Nikiforov, Communications Minister, on Tuesday at the Internet Economy forum. <br><br>  On Tuesday, it also became known that Vladimir Putin supported the proposal of the IT industry to limit government purchases of foreign software not only to government agencies, but also to state-owned companies. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297570/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297570/</a></p>
