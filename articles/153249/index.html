  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Publicity-privacy: a matter of respected public</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <i>Internet, Internet, do I need you or not?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>On the computer the article is, should I put it?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Facebook, Twitter, Google, how can I live without you?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Not taking a mobile phone with you, you remain out of the world ...</i> <i><br></i>  <i>If the event is not written on the Internet - this did not happen.</i> <br><br>  Recently, I began to seriously ask myself: should I follow fashion trends and lay out everything that I am interested in discussing with friends, everything I work on, all my plans on the Internet?  It is no secret that the percentage of coverage, the involvement of people and the number of Internet services are constantly growing.  But is it worth it for me to personally publish my thoughts, reasonings, and plans for public viewing?  The question, if you think about it, is far from simple.  It arose because laying out everything about everything is fraught with the following problems: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  - Information about me is constantly updated, not only by me, but also by my friends, acquaintances and even strangers, as well as fools, enemies and detractors <br>  - Information about me is stored forever <br>  - Information about me is connected to each other in many different ways, even without my participation, and this file is very convenient to use. <br>  - Information about me can be used against me in a mass of ways. <br><br>  As a result, my vulnerability is constantly growing: you can not even dig out, but simply fabricate and propagate a certain ‚Äúfact‚Äù, and your reputation is spoiled.  Forever and ever.  If the fact was, it is still worse - I will never wash.  Another way to cause serious harm is to use personal information for social hacking: using my personal data, pull money from relatives or kidnap a child and sell it abroad.  The third is to publish my contacts in the section of intimate services, to sell to spammers, and so on.  Now I use either the fourth, or the fifth mailbox as the main mailbox - the previous ones just drowned in the spam stream.  The same is happening now with the mobile.  SMS spam comes to me every day.  Fourth - take my development.  Everything I do can be done better by someone in this world than by me.  I am in no way the best in the world, and this is sad.  But on the Web, the interception of projects, orders, works is instantaneous and irreparable.

      What can be done here?  Little.  In fact, I do not have a particularly large selection.  To begin with, in the modern world, the Internet can be used in a read-only mode, like a newspaper or a TV.  Search for train schedules, find out what polyvinyl chloride is, or find the sample code you need at the moment or an entire library.  But then there is an interesting process of engaging in communication: if, having found the necessary tickets in the schedule, I want to buy them, you need to register on the site and order them, and the transaction history will remain in a bunch of places: in the payment system, in the seller‚Äôs website, in the bank.  Not exactly the same as coming to the cashier and buying a ticket, right?  If you need PVC pipes, I will again have to deal with leaving personal information in the store.  Well, let's say I found the company's phone, called and placed an order, or just went to the right address.  In this case, I managed to "not inherit".  But if I found errors in the library I needed, and I don‚Äôt have time to fix them, I‚Äôll have to contact the developers.  Although it is possible that an additional search will allow you to enter a solution published somewhere, but this is not a fact.  Already from these examples it is clear that the ‚Äúread only‚Äù mode is a mode with limited functionality, and I limit myself.  It takes effort and brings some results in anonymity.  But. <br><br>  What to do with creativity?  For your own development, you can write articles to the table, shoot videos and keep them on your computer, design cartoons or programs and watch them yourself - but this is all wrong.  Creativity needs listeners, and listeners need an author, and now I'm a public person.  And information on the web about the public person appears even faster.  If I need a job, you can search for programming or design orders yourself, but it is much better to write dozens of subject articles and allow people to communicate in comments.  Later, it costs me in a regular article to give a hint that I am free, and now the proposals from employers are pouring in the box. <br><br>  Promoting your services is a constantly advancing topic (sorry for the pun), in the meantime, working and living outside the Web will not be possible soon.  And even without a mobile, it‚Äôs hard: right now I can‚Äôt do a single payment operation in the Internet Bank without a mobile, I cannot communicate in social networks, Google and other services constantly require my mobile phone.  And if I do not want to give my cell phone to them?  If I do not want to use Twitter, each tweet is stored in the library of the US Congress?  If I do not want to use Facebook?  gugloplyus?  vkontakte?  habrabra  the internet? <br><br>  How to find someone who understands microcontroller programming without using the Internet?  How to find out the burning temperature of AI-92 gasoline?  How to sell a hard drive?  How to fill out a tax return?  To the fig and more questions.  In the course of life, more and more highly specialized issues are becoming more and more, more and more narrow specialists are required, the systems in which I live are becoming more and more difficult.  And all these issues are resolved faster, easier, more conveniently via the Network.  Moreover, the fascinations of the future come through the network.  I make a 3D printer based on the project RepRap.  I pay for online animation courses for my wife.  Communication is also there: I communicate with my old friends via Skype, because they live in Australia, America, Germany.  Picked up, you know.  What should I do now?  Send paper mail? <br><br>  So with this question I went to the Network - yes, you can go to visit and personally ask, of course, or ask your wife.  But this is only one opinion of one person ... So we came to the finish line: even the problem ‚Äúhow to live offline‚Äù is too complicated to trust it offline.  Probably better then ask "How to live online?".  After all, there is no choice.  Or is there? <br><br>  Speak out in the comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/153249/">https://habr.com/ru/post/153249/</a></p>
