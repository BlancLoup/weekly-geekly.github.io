  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Interview with Vlad Merzhevich</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Surely many of you, who impose, actively use htmlbook.ru as an online reference, for example, on styles.  Someone, perhaps, is a regular visitor of the forum htmlbook.ru.  I am sure that among the readers there are those who read the books ‚ÄúAccelerating the work of the site‚Äù and ‚ÄúHTML and CSS with examples‚Äù, and possibly also studied them.  Who unites all this?  Vlad Merzhevich, we meet with applause :) <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <strong>Hello, Vlad!</strong> <br>  Hi Dmitry <br>  <strong>Please tell me when you are interested in the web?</strong> <br>  Probably I was lucky in some way that the first editor for creating web pages I encountered was WebEdit.  This is not a visual editor and, although everything could be done through the menu buttons, involuntarily I had to learn HTML.  I learned how to create web pages myself.  Then, like many beginners, there was a fascination with frames, but I quickly said goodbye to them when I realized that this thing was not flexible enough.  As an example, due to a small error, the frame structure was opened in itself several times.  This, of course, does not speak about the lack of frames, but about their incorrect use, however, after that I switched to another layout system, namely to tables.  There was still a fascination with the program Microsoft FrontPage, it was then that I understood what its main drawback was.  No, the point is not at all that it was created by Microsoft, it is childish.  FrontPage takes on a lot, believing that he would do much more correctly than a man.  As a result, you have to constantly monitor this program, ‚Äúkeep it in check,‚Äù and you need to know both HTML and layout features in FrontPage, while newcomers do not yet have this knowledge. <br>  <strong>And when and how was the idea to publish the first book born?</strong> <br>  At one time he wrote several articles on reducing the amount of data on the site and speeding up its work.  But it turned out that there are enough articles for a small book, so I decided to contact various publishers to publish it.  And at that moment Yevgeny Rybakov from BHV addressed me and offered to write a book.  Here is an amazing coincidence of desires and opportunities.  After discussing the concept and content of the book, she came out under the title "Accelerating the work of the site." <br>  <strong>What is the total circulation?</strong>  <strong>By the way, how many books are there in total?</strong> <br>  Two books - "Acceleration of the site" and "HTML and CSS examples".  Circulation for the subject of standard - 5 thousand copies. <br>  <strong>Tell me how you created htmlbook.ru?</strong>  <strong>What were the difficulties?</strong> <br>  Like many, trying to figure out what information you can put on your future site.  Homepage intentionally did not want to do because of the narrowness of the topic.  Here's the idea to post small tips on the layout of web pages.  It turned out that this area is bypassed for some reason, although it is not necessary to convince anyone of its relevance.  This began with a dozen small articles, gradually the amount of information grew to a couple of hundred articles, while the subject matter expanded.  Not only layout tips, but HTML, CSS and more. <br>  <strong>What is site traffic now?</strong>  <strong>And the forum?</strong> <br>  The site is visited by an average of 9k per day, and the forum is about a thousand.  But what is interesting is that forum topics are viewed four times more often than site materials.  It is clear that they are used as a thematic knowledge base. <br>  <strong>I heard about the problems with the availability of the forum when you plan to solve them?</strong> <br>  Eh, this is a sore subject related to the popularity of the resource and, accordingly, the increased number of visitors.  Together with the hoster we are looking for ways to reduce the workload through technical means or switching to a dedicated server. <br>  <strong>Can you reveal a secret whether new projects are being prepared?</strong>  <strong>What kind?</strong>  <strong>Tell me more.</strong> <br>  This year I plan to launch the ‚Äúlong-term construction‚Äù WebReference.Ru, in early 2008, a <a href="http://htmlbook.ru/konkurs/">contest</a> for the design of this site was held on htmlbook.ru.  Now while working on the technology and principles of this resource on the example of the site "Graphics for the Web" (webimg.ru), which in a sense, serves as an experimental platform. <br>  There is also one interesting idea related to Krasnoyarsk, the city this year marks 380 years.  On this occasion, I want to make a website with panoramic photos of the city using QuickTime VR technology.  That is, these are not just flat images, they can be rotated horizontally by 360 ¬∞.  The effect of presence is provided. <br>  <strong>What blogs and sites do you read?</strong>  <strong>Share the selection from the "chef".</strong> <br>  Morning, like many Internet users, begins with bashorga.  Also, I definitely go to sites about movies, I love this thing.  I visit thematic resources about web technologies as needed, I don‚Äôt have to contact me daily. <br>  <strong>Do you write articles other than your projects?</strong> <br>  No, and so my articles are borrowed from different sites.  I even encourage this practice, but with the obligatory reference to the source.  So the rating of projects and grows slowly. <br>  <strong>If I write a very interesting article, will you publish it, for example, on htmlbook.ru?</strong> <br>  Of course, the more applications were already published and articles by third-party authors were published. <br>  <strong>And who do you work now?</strong>  <strong>Where?</strong> <br>  Recently, he worked as the head of the IT department in a Krasnoyarsk company, but soon realized that the work was no longer encouraging and it took too much time.  So now I work for myself, I am engaged in consulting services for web technologies. <br>  <strong>Show your photo?</strong>  <strong>Creepy curious.</strong> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/923/bf6/c9f/923bf6c9f616c55fdbb06f8e5eb23887.jpg" alt="Interview with Vlad Merzhevich"><br>  <strong>Thanks for taking the time!</strong>  <strong>Would you recommend something to novice webmasters?</strong> <br>  There are no absolute laws and truths in web design.  Of course, it is necessary to know the basics, but everything else depends on you.  We must learn and turn their knowledge into a subject that should be proud of! <br><br>  Cross post from my <a href="http://absolvo.ru/2008-06-05/intervyu-s-vladom-merzhevichem/">blog</a> . </div>
