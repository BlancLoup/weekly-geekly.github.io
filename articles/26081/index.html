  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Problems of Russian education</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In recent weeks, many issues have been raised in one way or another based on education.  I asked my friend to write a series of articles on this topic. She has been in education for many years and can tell ‚Äúas it is‚Äù from the inside, so if you are interested in this topic, I suggest asking questions in the comments.  It is on them that further articles of the cycle will be based. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Personality debilitation reforms </h2><br>  The end of the 90s, against the background of the destruction of the socio-economic factors of development, is a ruin in education: non-payment of salaries, lack of money for school repairs, provision of the material and technical sphere of the OS  However, the main thing is the first reform of the content of education: a system of education is introduced in elementary school for 1-3 years.  What is it poured?  The certificate was given for a nine-year education, although in fact the child was only 8 years old.  Where did budget money go for 1 year?  According to the psychological and age characteristics of students, children who did not complete the 4 years of primary school education, getting into the 5th grade often could not master the program, there were conflicts not only external but also within the personality.  Then appeared correctional training classes.  In general, all this led to the debilization of the population, the emergence of "brigades", people without honor and without conscience.  When it was no longer possible to hide the theft of budget money, new reforms emerged: education reform, education modernization - 2002; federal program for the development of education until 2010.  The Ministry of Education has swallowed money for each of these projects, and in fact, which project with which new word is waiting for us in the near future? <br><h3>  Modern pseudo-education </h3><br><ul><li>  There is no modern material and technical base of education. <br></li><li>  The system of the gap between the pedagogical community and the management of education has been built.  Upstairs government officials (most often illiterate educators and dropouts, receiving 30-50 thousand) and a teacher with a salary of 4 thousand.  In order to feed the family, they take 1.5-2 rates, or even more.  Although the teacher should work 18 hours a week.  Today, with a new reform <br>  education, in terms of per capita funding, the teacher must perform such a number of functions, including research work, that there is simply no time left for the teacher‚Äôs activities. <br></li><li>  There are no competent teachers with modern thinking and general cultural competence. <br></li><li>  The school is provided with a large number of textbooks that do not fit together.  We follow the path of George Soros, the more information, the more misinformation.  Not to mention the media that lives its occult life, offering it as a model. <br></li><li>  Pedagogical universities produce something medium between a senior seller in a supermarket and a manager, who is practically deprived of general cultural training, not to mention a special one.  Modern youth is quite apathetic and childish, and basically self-determined by the age of 30, i.e.  missing the most creative years. <br></li><li>  The government, speaking of reforms, has never said about creating jobs for the younger generation.  In the conditions of de-industrialization of the country, there is no goal of training for the country. <br></li><li>  The speed of ongoing reforms does not allow focusing, since  The conceptual apparatus and educational paradigms are changing completely.  The chaos that exists in education does not allow improving the educational process and providing education to the younger generation worthy of the 21st century. </li></ul></div>
