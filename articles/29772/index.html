Another 1 student received the task to write a clone of the finished site.  I'll tell you how it ended. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Descriptions of the beginning and middle of the events described <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/study/34091.html">here</a> and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/study/40221.html">here</a> . <br><br><h1>  Goals </h1><br>  What goals did I set: <br>  <strong>1. Teaching students</strong> <br>  Everyone had to grow above themselves.  The peculiarity of the situation is that I got 9 of the best from the stream - undergraduates, who have a direct road to graduate school with due diligence. <br>  A special role was assigned to me by the head of the number of students - the coordinator.  It was one of the most capable and organized, which had to be ‚Äúresponsible for everything‚Äù, as in real projects.

      <strong>2. Running in technology</strong> <br>  I wanted to get an answer to the questions: <br>  - can this be done or not? <br>  - If so, what does this give participants?  Is the game worth the candle? <br>  - If not, whose fault is it?  My?  Coordinator (read team leader) or performers? <br>  - Do we need a version control system, a bugtracker, a discussion channel?  forum? <br>  - what is the optimal group size?  who and how it should be selected / allowed? <br>  <strong>3. Getting a working prototype</strong> <br>  It was important to get at least one system, entirely written by students, for further development and launch. <br>  I wanted to learn how to learn php + mysql + web technologies in general + any framework = trained students + project. <br><br><h1>  Total </h1><br>  The problems that I mentioned in the previous topic, namely the inability to organize work in a team, the extremely low level of knowledge of web technologies, OOP and readiness to learn, demonstrated by the majority of participants, have only worsened over time.  As a result, the project was implemented in the state ‚Äúthe site is made, but nothing works‚Äù. <br><br>  Reference: <a href="http://volgometr.intervolga.ru/">Volgometer</a> <br><br><h1>  Results (by objectives) </h1><br>  <strong>1. Training</strong> <br>  Everyone grew up.  Especially, I suppose, this applies to those who encoded, who installed and who led.  A person who has mastered the beginnings of ajax is also worthy of respect.  Of course, there were those who rode ‚Äúon a quiet wave‚Äù, but it was everyone‚Äôs choice.  This goal, I believe, is achieved. <br><br>  <strong>2. Technology</strong> <br>  Break in technology was only partially. <br>  - You can do this, but only with small groups, with high qualifications, a clear desire to work on the part of students, prepared TK in advance, and a detailed distribution of duties.  All this we lacked. <br>  - my fault in the failure of the project as a working site is also there, and it is considerable.  I see it first of all in the absence of a systematic lecture presentation of all the material that they might need.  Secondly, this is a reassessment of student strength.  Most of the time they were in the ‚Äúorganizational tupnyak‚Äù, simply not understanding from what end to gnaw a task.  Coordinator, by the way, was chosen correctly, he is 50% and provided at least the appearance of such a result. <br>  - necessarily need a means of team development sites.  Frankly, I am not ready to make such a choice now, but it is necessary for organizing teamwork.  As a means of communication is quite enough project forum. <br>  - optimal group size: 1-2 or 4-5 people for large tasks.  8 is a lot. <br><br>  <strong>3. Project</strong> <br>  A working prototype did not arise. <br>  There was something that did not even want to touch.  No standards for coding, design, security, and team development were observed in the last week before delivery. <br><br><h1>  My findings and questions </h1><br>  I appeal to the habrasoobschestvu (since from September 1, I will conduct the same thing to 65 students of different levels): <br><br>  <strong>1. Theory.</strong> <br>  We need to prepare for systematic lecturing on the web in general, php, mysql, the basics of security and so on.  I have all this material in my head, but there is simply no time for its systematization.  I would be extremely grateful for the material for lectures (you know, manuals as lectures work extremely poorly). <br><br>  <strong>2. Tasks.</strong> <br>  You need to have a set of tasks from the most simple to such group projects.  By the way, the task of cloning the site <a href="http://oscilloscop.ru/">oscilloscop.ru</a> , received by one student, he performed almost perfectly.  Everyone would like that.  I suppose it could be tasks for developing a simple element based on a ready-made framework, regressive design, cloning sites.  I would be extremely grateful for the ideas. <br><br>  <strong>3. Framework.</strong> <br>  It is necessary to choose, and extremely responsibly, the basic framework for this work.  Documented, simple, well-written, not necessarily fancy.  Unfortunately, the range of such developments is not well known to me.  I will be glad to any tips and links. <br><br>  <strong>4. Means of organizing collective labor.</strong> <br>  You need to select and implement a project teamwork tool with version tracking, bug reporting, and more.  The simpler the better.  I would be grateful for the advice. <br><br>  Thank you for your attention and comments. <br><br>  ps Honestly, there is really nothing to boast about, and I did not want to write this post.  Helped the argument: "said A - say B."  In addition, after 1.5 months, the same issues will have to be resolved at a completely different level. <br><br>  pps All students received positive marks.  The best are the coordinator, the most capable programmer and the person who made a clone of the site oscilloscop.ru alone. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/29772/">https://habr.com/ru/post/29772/</a></p>
