Multi-colored stripes appeared on the screen due to damage to the monitor's matrix, plus it began to overheat and slow down.  I used to be a supporter of large laptops, because very rarely I took it somewhere with me, and on the big screen it is much more pleasant to work.  Recently, I began to look towards more mobile solutions, such as netbooks, since they are cheaper and I still wanted to have a computer with me while studying at the university.  Thus, it was finally decided in favor of buying a netbook. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  My strategy for buying electronics and other things on the Internet recently has been to research amazon.com.  There is such a useful feature as user reviews for which you can quickly form an opinion about how satisfied they are with the thing by the number of stars, and if the thing is interesting, then you can read the reviews themselves and find out what specific advantages and disadvantages the owners have encountered.  This time when choosing a netbook, I did the same.  Here is a description of the Samsung NC10 netbook on Amazon.  I liked the computer characteristics and user reviews and in a few days I made an order from Amazon.  Usually, before a major purchase, I wait a few days in case I change my mind or if I get the best offer. <br><br>  Netbooks are much smaller in size and weight than regular laptops.  This is the main advantages and disadvantages of such computers.

        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

      <br>
      Advantages: <br><br>  1) Mobility. <br><br>  Screen size 10.2 inches.  It weighs only 1.3 kg.  That is, it is about the size of a book, although it is heavier than a book.  But nevertheless, compared with a regular laptop, the difference in weight and size is very significant.  I put my samsung in my bag with which I go to study and there is still a lot of room for books.  Lectures I take notes directly into it.  A long time ago I learned how to print using the ten-finger blind method, so typing is easier and faster for me than writing with a pen.  At recess and sometimes even at lectures I use it to browse the Internet via WiFi, read blogs.  Yes, in my American university almost everywhere on campus there is free WiFi for students.  I hope that in Kazakhstan someday will be the same. <br><br>  2) Battery. <br><br>  Battery frankly pleased.  Although it is usual for laptops - six-cell (6 cells), but for a netbook this turned out to be more than enough, since it consumes much less energy than a regular laptop.  As a result, the computer can be used for about 5 hours without recharging.  I have enough of it for the whole school day.  The lack of need to look for an outlet and carry with them the power supply is very good. <br><br>  3) 160 GB hard drive <br><br>  I understand that now it is probably considered not so much, but for me such a large number of gigabytes was a pleasant plus.  Some other netbooks use flash cards of about 10 GB.  Such a netbook can not be considered a full-fledged computer, but rather is a device for accessing the Internet. <br><br>  4) Cute <br><br>  For me, this parameter is not particularly important, but I actually received a lot of compliments to my netbook.  People are surprised at the miniature and say that it looks cute.  You can make your opinion by looking at the pictures. <br><br>  Disadvantages: <br><br>  1) Size <br><br>  The keyboard, the screen, the laptop, everything is much smaller than that of a regular computer.  Because of this, the first time was very crowded and it caused discomfort.  But as it turned out, this is a matter of habit, so now everything is in order.  The lack of screen size I decided for myself by buying a separate 19-inch monitor.  It simply connects and works great with an external monitor. <br><br>  2) Braking <br><br>  Some slowdown is present despite the seemingly normal 1.6 GHz Intel Atom N270 processor and 2 GB of RAM (I bought 1 gigabyte separately and installed it myself).  With climbing on the Internet and office programs, the program copes with a bang.  The video also shows well.  The only problem with the lack of resources that I encountered was in the games.  It would seem that even fairly simple 2D games that do not require a lot of resources run with terrible brakes.  On the other hand, this is even a plus for me, as it will prevent me from spending my time on games. <br><br>  I summarize.  I was very pleased with the purchase.  For relatively little money (about $ 450), I got a convenient computer that you can easily and long carry with you or work comfortably at home (with an external monitor). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ccf/492/148/ccf492148f96657bd835b93383a0b33c.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bfa/9b9/4a4/bfa9b94a4058ea23a2650dfd8a4c9266.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5a7/b84/366/5a7b8436649589120e8fa194360da26e.jpg" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/63599/">https://habr.com/ru/post/63599/</a></p>
