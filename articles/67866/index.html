I don‚Äôt intend to save Duke Newkem from death; it turns out that there are still games in the world that live on pure enthusiasm and fascinate with chilling charm. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  I wanted to talk to you about text games.  About Interactive Fiction <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/games/67399/">have already been written</a> , and they wrote meaningfully and with knowledge of the issue from the inside.  But text games are not limited to interactive literature.

      The history of computer games begins with the advent of interactive television in 1951.  For a long time, the games remained nothing more than programs for randomizing the movement of light points on the oscilloscope screen, which were played by research institutes.  The situation has changed <b>Colossal cave</b> , she ADVENT, she is just Adventure.  This, oddly enough, the programmer wrote a programmer, he is a speleologist <b>Will Crowther</b> for his daughters after his divorce from his wife.  On the one hand, nostalgia, on the other hand, the papal programmer decided to do a gift with fantasy elements to his daughters.  The original game did not reach us, but <a href="http://www.rickadams.org/adventure/e_downloads.html">from this site</a> you can download the original version, added by Don Woods, as well as a bunch of subsequent ones. <br><br>  Adventure laid the foundations of control in text games - in order to go north, the game needed to be told exactly that, that is to say ‚Äúnorth‚Äù.  It was also the beginning of the command syntax, which seems to be taken for granted, namely, [action] - [subject] - [option].  For example, fill bottle and climb plant. <br><br>  It is unlikely that anyone will challenge my belief that there is a certain charm in text games.  And it lies precisely in the absence of all that what game companies are trying to attract a buyer in the first place.  The maximum of special effects - painted words, remember, do not remember the control commands - you still miss the bonus, and to complete the game, you need to read mana.  And not only mana, you just need to read.  The first player-players did not even suspect that these were minuses and continued to drag the world.  And then the story of text games went along two paths of development.  The first continued to live in the genre of adventure and / or spilled ink on paper, becoming <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/games/67399/">Interactive Fiction</a> , and in the second type of games they added the possibility of multiplayer games, and MUDs appeared. <br><br>  <b>The MUD</b> is Multiuser Dimension / Dungeon / Dialogue, a multi-user space / dimension / catacomb / dialog.  As you like.  More than others in the Russian language, the abbreviation MMM, the multiplayer world has taken root.  MMM is now an online game in which the entire steepness of a knocked piece of clothing can only be assessed by the brain, after having read its description.  Roughly speaking, MMM is the same as the MMORPG.  Only something completely different :) Yes, there are guilds, arenas, non-copies, martial arts, and so on, but most, if not all, of the MMM are free, keep in the heat of the players and moderators and play, if not through telnet, then through the command line of the MUD client.  Some of the most numerous, and most interesting MMMs are <a href="http://www.df2.ru/">Dangerous Fantasy</a> , cyber-punk, MMM, <a href="http://arda.pp.ru/index.shtml">Arda MUD</a> , created from the books of <a href="http://www.adan.ru/">J.R.R.Tolkien</a> , <a href="http://www.adan.ru/">Adamant Adan</a> , whose creation was also attached to the same person, and the notorious MUD <a href="http://sowsite.igrohost.ru/">Sphere of worlds</a> .  This is from the Russian-speaking.  If teams like ‚Äúfill a fountain jar‚Äù dream of a young humanist in nightmares, you can search the <a href="http://www.mudconnector.su/">MUD-connector</a> and find a suitable English-language MMM with the Russian community.  Oh yeah, to play comfortably, you need something like a <a href="http://www.gryphon-clan.ru/jmc/">Jaba MUD Client</a> or a <a href="http://www.zuggsoft.com/zmud/zmudinfo.htm">zMUD MUD Client</a> .  Nothing more than nimble hands and a hernia of the brain is needed. <br><br>  The next stop on our unique journey through the wreckage of Oldfagia is <b>PBEM</b> , that is, Play By Electronic Mail.  Now this dinosaur in Russia has almost become extinct, leaving only one viable offspring of "Ostracism" and "Mafia" - the project <a href="http://ludoedy.ru/">Lyudoedy.Ru</a> .  PBEM can be considered the ancestor of "Cannibals", but this game is implemented in the web interface.  We wanted interactive literature - get-sign!  Not only is the multiplayer game, not only is it necessary to write the gaming environment yourself, so you can also give you the brains.  The essence of the game is this;  You came to the island, who you are - decide for yourself, what is important here is that if you don‚Äôt eat you - they will eat you, at a strictly planned time.  On a common wall, players write down their legends and play a tricky game.  Someone is political, someone is literary. <br><br>  And finally - a little bit of lulz, namely, the game <b>Gopnik</b> .  To which genre this masterpiece is attributed - think for yourself, probably, this is a text action RPG.  The main character got into the harsh world of the street, and now he must choose the side of the Force.  You can play for Thugs, Podtsana, Gopnik or Thief and either wander around the streets in search of adventure, or sit in a rocking chair, or stand up for familiar boys and rock pontovost. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/69b/daf/f4e/69bdaff4edd1b305e98ca5d09d256f0c.gif" alt="Gopnik"><br><br>  Specific humor delivers, however, with the release of the second part, the control system became more complicated, the complexity increased and the number of the mat, which was not at all in the first part, increased.  But the humor remained: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/707/b36/ea0/707b36ea0c039a907cf1314208779942.gif" alt="Gopnik2"><br><br>  You can download games here: <a href="http://narod.ru/disk/12822359000/GOPNIK.zip.html">Gopnik Raz</a> and <a href="http://narod.ru/disk/12822363000/GOPNIK2.zip.html">Gopnik Two</a> . <br><br>  Play old games !!! <br><br>  <b>Here on the Internet lay around:</b> <br><br>  <a href="http://ifiction.ru/">iFiction</a> is a forum dedicated to interactive literature; <br>  <a href="http://qsp.su/">Quest Soft Player</a> - a platform for a variety of text games; <br>  <a href="http://www.rtads.org/">RTADS</a> is another, and no worse; <br>  <a href="http://myquest.ru/">myquest</a> - game books and text games; <br>  <a href="http://www.mudconnector.com/">Mudconnector.com</a> - mnogomadoff; <br>  <a href="http://www.smeshnoe.info/story00645.html">In the appendage</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/67866/">https://habr.com/ru/post/67866/</a></p>
