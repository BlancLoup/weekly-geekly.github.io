  <section class="page js-page"><h1>My blog. Lives of one trader</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Now trading on the Forex market is being actively advertised.  Trading is served almost as a win-win option to get into financial paradise without any effort.  I bought it here, I sold it there - profit in my pocket.  Lafa, and only. <br><br>  But why 95% of all people who have come to trade, leave the business, losing money?  At best, this is a small amount, and at worst - the selection of apartments, cars, property on account of debt obligations and loans. <br><br>  But if it is so dangerous, then it may be generally better to stay away from these dealing centers, brokers, and the stock exchange in general?  Everyone has the right to make their choice.  But before you make a decision you need to get maximum information from different sources.

      Several years that I have been trading, supported by practical experience of real trading, active communication with like-minded people and knowledge sharing, led me to create my own blog, in which I tell in popular language what kind of exchange trading is activities - trading. <br><br>  The blog will show the main chapters of my novel ‚ÄúFrom $ 100 to $ 1,000,000 - biographies of one trader‚Äù, since I believe that the best way to present complex and voluminous information is a work of art.  I love to write, especially since the events described are not fiction or fantasy. <br><br>  On the blog pages I will try to talk not only about the difficulties I faced myself, being alone with such elements as the MARKET, but also to share my knowledge in using various methods of technical analysis, indicators, various trading systems and methods.  Much attention will be paid to the psychology of trading and the main mistakes that speculators make.  Not only beginners, but even bison. <br><br>  By the way, the pen of your humble servant belongs to one of the best sections in runet for graphical analysis of candlesticks in one of the trading forums, applying this knowledge in practice. <br><br>  If this topic is interesting to you - I will be glad to see at a party.  In the meantime, answers to some burning questions that interest those who do not yet have much experience in trading. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>1. How to start trading?</b> <br>  Now DC offer to trade using mainly the terminal MT4.  Download, install, open a demo account or a real account and voila. <br><br>  <b>2. How much money does it take to get started?</b> <br>  Basically, you can start learning the wisdom of trading on a demo account, without investing your real money.  Either start to participate in traders' contests, where it is realistic to win a deposit in the amount of 200-1000 dollars (duration of contests from several hours to a month or more).  And so in different DC you can open cent accounts (from 2 dollars for example) and above.  But as a rule, the recommended amount of 50-100 dollars. <br><br>  <b>3. What can I trade?</b> <br>  Currency pairs (this is Forex), futures (gold, oil, wood, cocoa, etc.), stocks, ETFs, etc. <br>  <b>4. How much can you earn?</b> <br>  It all depends on your goals and how you trade.  I applied various MM and RM schemes (money management and risk management) and I was able to maximize my deposit 30 times in a couple of days.  But this approach is able to prematurely destroy the deposit in the blink of an eye.  As a rule, it is this final that is pursued by most attempts to grab Market by the beard.  But in general, I believe that it is better to proceed from more modest requests - 10-20% per month, taking into account the compound percentage - a great result.  But it still needs to be expensive.  In general, for those who wish to manage funds in the future, one can proceed from 30% per annum and low drawdowns. <br><br>  <b>5. This is a casino, roulette!</b> <br>  Not really, although it seems.  The fact is that using the methods of technical, graphical, fundamental analysis of graphs, you can make a forecast regarding the further price movement.  You will set a protective stop, at which the transaction will automatically close, bringing you a conscious loss, but it will save your deposit.  In the event of a favorable development of events, you will receive a profit. <br><br>  <b>6. But how can you make money then?</b> <br>  As a rule, the profit is obtained on the difference between the number of profitable and unprofitable transactions.  For example, profitable transactions 60%, unprofitable - 40%.  If in each transaction we risked an amount of $ 50, and the profit was also calculated in the amount of $ 50, then out of 10 transactions the profit will be (6 * 50) - (4 * 50) = 100 dollars.  There is another option: less profitable transactions, but the risk / reward ratio in each transaction can reach 1: 5 and higher. <br><br>  Shl.  Since my blog is not designed for mass visits, please forgive if it falls.  In general, thank you for your attention and good luck in everything! <br><br>  I will be glad to hear your wishes regarding the development of this topic on my platform. <br><br>  Yes, <a href="http://deipara.com/">blog address</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/71192/">https://habr.com/ru/post/71192/</a></p>
