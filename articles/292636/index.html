  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Lenovo has shown record growth in sales of its smartphones in the Russian market</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Lenovo management seems to have chosen the right strategy, keeping prices for their devices in Russia in check.  This is - one of the factors that allowed the company to double sales in the first half of 2015, <a href="http://top.rbc.ru/technology_and_media/15/07/2015/55a6314b9a7947861e1187ad">writes</a> RBC.  Now in terms of sales of mobile devices, Lenovo is one of the three leaders in the Russian market. <br><br>  From January to June, the sales of smartphones of this company increased by 101% in real terms, up to 800 thousand units in relation to the same period last year.  Growth in monetary terms was 95%, to 6 billion rubles.  As for the company's market share, it has doubled - up to 9% in kind and up to 7% in money.  Now, according to Svyaznoy, Lenovo has overtaken Samsung in sales of phones in the category from 5 to 10 thousand rubles. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The general director of the Russian division of Lenovo, Alexander Kataev, the company's smartphone sales in Russia increased 1.5‚Äì2 times over the year.  Kataev believes that this growth is associated with a policy of price containment.  ‚ÄúAfter the fall of the ruble exchange rate, many manufacturers sharply raised prices for their devices, as a result, those became unavailable to buyers,‚Äù Kataev commented on the situation. <br><br>  In the spring and summer of this year, the company's smartphones were sold so actively that in some cases there was even a shortage of devices.  In the Eldorado network in the first half of this year, the share of Lenovo devices has doubled compared with the first half of last year.

      The executive vice president of Euroset, Viktor Lukanin, believes that the popularity of Lenovo smartphones can also be explained by the release of a whole range of devices (10 new models came out in a year), and not just one device.  At the same time, the South Korean corporation Samsung is losing its position.  Perhaps some of the buyers who used Samsung products before have switched to Lenovo. <br><br>  In the first half of this year, the share of Lenovo‚Äôs sales in real terms doubled, to 8% when compared with 2014.  Now Lenovo is not the ninth place, as before, but the third.  In terms of revenue, this company showed a twofold increase, taking the fourth position. <br><br>  The absolute values ‚Äã‚Äãof sales of smartphones of the Chinese company in the Russian market in the first half of 2015, compared to the same period last year, almost doubled in physical terms, and 120% in money terms. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/292636/">https://habr.com/ru/post/292636/</a></p>
