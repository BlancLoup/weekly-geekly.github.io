But we met the plan and, as we should, on April 1 released the fifth version, which I proudly report to everyone, but with a slight delay. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/da9/c0e/48f/da9c0e48fdc13aa17b0acd30d45adb4e.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  No matter how pathetic it may sound, but we believe that familiarity with our CMS will be useful to anyone who in one way or another is concerned with creating websites.  Of course, there are different suitable solutions for different sites, somewhere there is enough WordPress, and somewhere you can't do without Beatrix, but we are sure that there is a niche that we are trying to occupy in the CMS market, and we look very good there.  Moreover, if several years ago we positioned ourselves as a simple CMS for business card websites and ‚Äúeven‚Äù small stores, today our CMS allows you to do almost everything, including serious stores, and there are enthusiastic statements among user reviews that we are much better than most competitors . <a name="habracut"></a>

      In short, I will go over the key features of the fifth version of diafan.CMS. <br><br>  The administrative panel has been completely transformed, except for the new design with the now fashionable support for changing the themes of the background, added sorting of items by dragging, dragging onto pages, dragging from branch to branch, asynchronous loading of expanded items.  As well as notifications of new events in interactive modules, quick editing of fields, quick creation of elements and new group operations. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8a3/c62/e65/8a3c62e656ecc5f816091886504ce453.gif"></a> <br><br>  In short, we tried to put together all the management of the site as succinctly as possible, so that editing the site was very convenient, fast, and, of course, pleasant to the eye.  For example, you can add news to the site in two clicks plus ‚ÄúSave‚Äù.  We are sure that no advertising brochure will give those impressions about the product, except as a live test drive.  Therefore, you need to twist the <a href="http://demo.cms.diafan.ru/">demo version</a> , and make your own decision about the new interface diafan.CMS. <br><br>  Special attention deserves the module "Store".  Perhaps this is the most voluminous module in the entire CMS, we worked on it for more than one month. <br>  In the fifth version, we added a new type of product - ‚Äúfile‚Äù.  Those.  You can download a file as a commodity, for example, a book, music or an archive with a program, and after payment, the buyer can download it from a secret link that has been in effect for a while. <br>  Now we have multicurrency, very flexible discounts, several payment modules (robocash, webmoney, Ya.D., kiwi).  We are able to compare products on the characteristics, make sheets of desires.  With all this, the characteristics of the goods have been processed, they can be specified when sorting, attached to several sections.  And you can also make cumulative discounts, give out coupons to users, add related services to orders and much more.  We also have imports of goods from CSV and exports to YML, accounting for balances in stock and price-dependent characteristics with a separate quantity accounting.  This is when you can specify the shoes "black / brown / blue", size "41/42/43/44/45" and the material "cow leather / crocodile leather", specify a separate amount of each variation and make a different price for ordinary leather or crocodile! <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a63/b10/5ee/a63b105eee14be8199d14060b9d4a1f1.gif" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  And of course, a lot of opportunities in terms of SEO.  If you take a page of a single product, then you can easily and conveniently assign unique CNC, title, keywords, descriptions, H1, and even design. <br><br>  You can edit the site without going into the administrative part, in the ‚Äúwhat I see, then edit‚Äù mode, which is very convenient for adjusting prices or checking typos on the site. <br><br>  We now have a total of 25 modules, and on our engine, almost any site can be raised.  And as always, technical support is unlimited, updates are free. <br><br>  Constructive criticism, questions on the topic and sensible wishes are welcome! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/140950/">https://habr.com/ru/post/140950/</a></p>
