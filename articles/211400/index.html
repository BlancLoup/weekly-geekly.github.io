  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Motorola Moto G - for beginners and budget</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  After Motorola was acquired by search giant Google in 2011, the new owner had no particular impact on the release of smartphones.  But soon the company was incredibly quickly and rapidly changed.  The first and very successful products of the updated Motorola became the Moto X and the DROID line for the Verizon service provider.  The company further stated that it was going to start conquering markets that had not yet been fully formed.  The first move in this direction was the release of the budget smartphone Moto G. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/595/ea6/957/595ea69574379a7021724018a094f985.jpg"><br><br>  And if the Nexus 5 is more of a smartphone for geeks and fans of this line, and Moto X is mainly for people who cannot resist creating their own design, Moto G is for those who want a functional device at a reasonable price. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <font color="ff9c00">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS</font> </h2><br>  First of all, Moto G is an inexpensive smartphone, but its filling is still cool!  The device runs on a quad-core Snapdragon 400 (MSM8226) with a clock frequency of 1.2 GHz and Adreno 305 GPU.  The chip is much better than the MediaTek MT6589 processor, which is also based on the ARM Cortex A7.  Thanks to the latest version of Android and 1 GB of RAM, there are no lags with multitasking.  The smartphone also supports two navigation systems - the Russian GLONASS and the American GPS.

And then we see focusing on the prefix "a Google <s>Lenovo</s> company", which has already had a little impact on the device - the release of the Google Edition. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/510/120/560/5101205606cfc830904dc0f528dab183.jpg"><br><br>  Included is a white microUSB cable and some pieces of paper.  That's all.  No charger and headset.  Motorola says that this is a move to reduce costs and it is assumed that you already have a charger. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/287/d1b/4d6/287d1b4d6a9d434eea4ba8296f6581c1.jpg"><br><br>  The instruction ‚ÄúLet's get started‚Äù is colorful and even interesting to look through, the documents are written in English and Spanish.  It is rather strange that there is no German, which we saw on the box. <br><br><h2>  <font color="ffd800">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">DESIGN, DIMENSIONS, CONTROL ELEMENTS</font> </h2><br>  The front panel is completely covered with protective glass Gorilla Glass.  The glass is completely flat, without bulges and slopes, surrounded by small sides around the perimeter.  Thanks to the oleophobic coating, the screen is not very easily soiled and is easily wiped. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/946/68b/01d/94668b01ddef3173d827865ba6f958e9.jpg"><br><br>  Above is a conversational speaker, a camera eye and an event indicator.  Unfortunately, it shines only in white.  So what type of notifications came - can not be determined. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c01/e6b/5a2/c01e6b5a297c09ef4db7deff0e3f9cdb.jpg"><br><br>  On the right side are the volume and power buttons.  All the keys are very thin, quite hard, under the fingers feel nice.  From the side it looks like a kind of strict brick with rounded edges and a boat-shaped form. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/878/091/6bd/8780916bd598d3a8e77339b68dfd4b95.jpg"><br><br>  Bottom - micro-USB connector for charging and synchronizing with a computer.  Nearby is a microphone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0f8/26d/93a/0f826d93a3be77d326f4cad186cb76a6.jpg"><br><br>  On the left side there are no controls.  The case is only 11.6 mm thick, and it is in the thickest part, and in the thinnest one is only 6 mm.  This thickness does not cause negative sensations. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/848/2d6/2ee/8482d62eefc8ad87121607001b0d7fd3.jpg"><br><br>  On the upper side there is a 3.5 mm audio jack and a second microphone for noise cancellation.  Commendable, given that the model budget. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/df5/bf0/39f/df5bf039fcf9f3e1b5958b67db7585c2.jpg"><br><br>  The back surface is matte, without textures, the coating is made of soft-touch "soft-touch" plastic.  Fingerprints and other marks the surface collects on itself rather abundantly, but they are erased easily.  It looks beautiful on the back side, one dimple with a logo is worth something! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9aa/76d/5ba/9aa76d5ba2908a94bc039c5b1bf7cc97.jpg"><br><br>  On the back of the device are located: a camera, a flash and a cut where the speakerphone is located. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/528/631/1bf/5286311bfd9c637ac2e118534c7564e2.jpg"><br><br>  The case of the Moto G is not monolithic: the back cover of the smartphone is removable, only in which case the battery can not be changed.  And the yellow inscription warns us about this. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/886/318/d38/886318d38a78736b57d1e06bd3f3416a.jpg"><br><br>  Under the cover you can also find a slot for microSIM-card, it is on the side.  As you can see, the slot is named SIM 1, so it is logical that Motorola has released a version with support for two SIM cards.  Now this version is sold only in Brazil, Australia, Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia, India, and so on.  The timing of the appearance of a smartphone on the world market is not specified by the company. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3ea/99f/24f/3ea99f24feead65e6751b39888443ce3.jpg"><br><br>  As for the convenience of the smartphone, the Moto G due to the curved backrest is perfectly in the hand and is easily controlled.  Of course, a smartphone can not be called thin by modern standards, because it is 3.01 mm thicker than the Nexus 5, but this does not play any role in the portability of the smartphone.  The device impresses with its design and build quality - it seems as if you are holding Moto X in your hands. <br><br><h2>  <font color="00a8ff">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">DISPLAY</font> </h2><br>  The screen of the Moto G, perhaps one of the best in its class.  The diagonal is 4.5 inches, the resolution is 1280 √ó 720 pixels.  Such a parameter, as the density of pixels per inch, is 329 ppi here, which is very good for a screen of such a small physical size. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/595/c29/fd8/595c29fd84efc98f629dbb73860a0b58.jpg"><br><br>  Since the IPS matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãinstalled in Moto G, there is no color inversion when you look away from the normal to the screen or tilt the smartphone itself, the colors always look bright and saturated.  With such a bright screen, you can work comfortably even in strong external lighting, for example, in the sun. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a05/d86/14f/a05d8614f3c623ed8d940268d5db015e.jpg"><br><br>  The display brightness can be adjusted manually, and you can also use the automatic adjustment - the corresponding check mark in place.  Multitouch technology here allows you to handle up to 10 simultaneous touches.  There is a smartphone and proximity sensor, which locks the screen when you bring the smartphone to your ear. <br><br><h2>  <font color="808080">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">DISASSEMBLY</font> </h2><br>  The back cover that covers the battery is removed quite easily.  Then you need to unscrew all the screws (and there are already 14 of them!) With a Torx T5 screwdriver.  And then gently pry the lid around the perimeter. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/86c/552/db8/86c552db8145b64ff74c66d670c0df2e.jpg"><br><br>  On the cover there are: a jack for headphones, a speaker, a flash LED and a protective glass for the camera. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dfd/171/ae4/dfd171ae4367f0feaacb8de510abfecd.jpg"><br><br>  Under the cover is a 3.8V and 2070mAh lithium polymer battery.  Battery ID: SNN5932A, ED30.  Compatible with Moto G and Moto G DualSIM only.  By the way, Motorola advises to use chargers with output from 500 mA to 1.5 A. If there is more, the smartphone will automatically limit the current to the value that is needed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6a2/157/faa/6a2157faad18171b9a074987bf1399e0.jpg"><br><br>  The camera module, despite the size of the sensor, is quite compact. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cd8/bb4/6a9/cd8bb46a9f6b313a94f6cce7f5fa717f.jpg"><br><br>  To remove the battery, you need to carry a blunt plastic object around the perimeter, hooking the battery.  The battery is glued with double-sided tape to the main board. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/525/73f/51e/52573f51ecd23764a384a5ebdcdbaa5b.jpg"><br><br>  Quite a lot of screens and fees for the entire area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe smartphone.  Did you notice the connector for the second SIM card in the lower right corner?  But there is one problem, the card collector is not sealed (who would doubt), as is its binding. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/11f/a30/d8f/11fa30d8f196dbf9c292d678cf39a57d.jpg"><br><br>  The device is disassembled. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6e9/8d5/3dc/6e98d53dc00ebdaeab0e7b66f1bc209e.jpg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="ff0000">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">CAMERAS</font> </h2><br>  Motorola Moto G is equipped with two cameras.  The list of camera options is small: HDR, flash, manual focus and panoramic shot.  They appear when you move the screen to the right.  The opposite gesture opens the gallery.  Movement up and down are responsible for the zoom;  a fourfold increase is the maximum. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4d5/b0b/0c7/4d5b0b0c7a02fc7832272e51dc8e90e5.jpg"><br><br>  HDR mode.  By the way, the photo was <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/116135702854010163970/posts/XUimdXLLhXo">rated by</a> foreign users on Google +. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/880/273/fb7/880273fb7464972ad96adba9674594f5.jpg"><br><br>  Many of the inscriptions are readable.  In general, the front and middle plans worked out well. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5fb/1bc/544/5fb1bc54468b51fa38392ce5bfc0f270.jpg"><br><br>  But let's face it - if you buy Moto G, it is likely that it is not for the sake of snapshots.  The fact that there is a good camera here is just a bonus.  The main priorities are set for the processor and display. <br><br><h2>  <font color="00ffff">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">SOFTWARE PLATFORM</font> </h2><br>  Motorola Moto G is running the operating system Android 4.4.2.  The company did not specifically change the operating system.  In addition to the standard set of programs from Google, the smartphone has on board only a few utilities from the manufacturer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ae8/192/15c/ae819215ce49e25ac0f854d79090e97e.png"><br><br>  Motorola Assist is able to transfer the smartphone to the custom ‚ÄúMeeting‚Äù mode (if it is on the calendar) and to the ‚ÄúSleep‚Äù mode (at the set time every day).  Motorola Migrate helps to transfer all messages, contacts, call history, settings and various files from your old smartphone to a new one.  In addition, the application can transfer all data from the iPhone.  Motorola has added an FM receiver and developed a separate radio application that receives updates via the Play Store.  The interface is simple and clear, there is autoscanning and a list of favorite stations. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d7a/f04/a93/d7af04a93ce21f12987a5d410ab603b4.png"><br><br>  There is also its own technical support in the Help application.  Your questions will be answered in the chat, or you can make a call and talk with the operator.  Motorola Device ID will help determine where the device is located, and remotely block it or delete all data from it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f33/ffd/2a0/f33ffd2a026ba4e122807a130f9c2c66.png"><br><br>  In order to take a picture on the Moto G, just touch the screen at any point.  Additionally, you can activate the focusing on tapu, after which the camera will focus on the part of the picture that you specify.  To get to the camera settings, you need to drag your finger from the left edge of the screen to the center to get to the gallery - from the right. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/578/62d/ffd/57862dffd3324ced61bf43ea2b812e5f.png"><br><br>  By default, the user has 12.92 of 16GB of smartphone memory.  But there is a small bonus to the owners of Moto G - 50 GB of free space on Google Drive for 2 years. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e3a/113/6af/e3a1136af9af376b38f6a05c443bde9e.png"><br><br>  Most recently, Motorola released its own Gallery app on Google Play.  The application has three photo viewing modes, including Camera Roll, Timeline and Albums.  In Camera Roll mode, the more thoughtful display of thumbnails of the photos taken, as well as easy navigation between them, draws attention.  Timeline sorts photos by time, and Albums displays thumbnails stored in photo folders. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cd1/dc4/dff/cd1dc4dff465716bc4d17df1f245c355.png"><br><br>  Basically, the Moto G interface is the reference ‚Äúbare‚Äù Android without harmful software from the manufacturer.  Updates come almost immediately after the official release, the system works quickly, the responsiveness is excellent.  In addition, Motorola took over the device support model from Google and started releasing updates for various standard applications directly through the Play Store, which allows for quick delivery of updates to device owners.  Therefore, we can safely say that your smartphone will not soon lose its relevance in terms of software. <br><br><h2>  <font color="EA5F39">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">WIRELESS NETWORKS</font> </h2><br>  The smartphone works in cellular networks 2G (GSM / GPRS / EDGE, 850/900/1800/1900 MHz) and 3G (850/900/1700/1900/2100 MHz).  In the presence of Bluetooth version 4.0 for transferring files and speech.  LTE unfortunately not. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/097/91b/e2a/09791be2a3c1b431bd97c204e9b238e7.png"><br><br>  The list of wireless communication protocols also includes Wi-Fi, working in standard b / g / n protocols.  At a distance of ~ 20 meters and 2 concrete walls, the signal level remains assured. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/038/09e/443/03809e4431bf4a543d244348aaa16985.png"><br><br>  The two-system Moto G module satellites well and relatively quickly.  The search for satellites is instant, in a minute you can see at least three.  Signals of the American satellites are caught faster.  GLONASS signals are better caught in open space and worse - under the trees and among tall houses;  nothing was observed for GPS. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d78/d8b/5e4/d78d8b5e4cfbdc5f9dc644cc1acc8574.png"><br><br>  OTG works without any complaints from the box. <br><br><h2>  <font color="9000ff">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">PRODUCTIVITY</font> </h2><br>  The company Qualcomm, to press and somehow grab the share of the budget segment from MediaTek, has released the platform MSM8226.  The WTR2605 transceiver, along with GPS, supports the Russian satellite navigation system GLONASS.  According to the manufacturer, the WTR2605 consumes 40% less energy than transceivers of previous generations, and its size is 60% less than its predecessors.  In addition, the chip is equipped with a dual-channel LPDDR2 memory controller (up to 500 MHz) and various communication modules.

In general, it is now quite difficult to find an inexpensive and good device on pure Android, but Motorola is trying to change this situation.  The interface, thanks to a clean OS, responsive to user actions, without brakes and glitches.  The camera shoots is not very good, but its part of the cost of a smartphone is fully justified.  I also liked the battery life.  As for the absence of the Russian language in the menu, then personally it didn‚Äôt cause me any inconvenience, in any case, this deficiency can be corrected. <br>  IMHO, but this is the best phone in this price class today.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GWR36F6/ref%3Das_li_qf_sp_asin_tl%3Fie%3DUTF8%26camp%3D1789%26creative%3D9325%26creativeASIN%3DB00GWR36F6%26linkCode%3Das2%26tag%3Dboxover-20">Buy Moto G 8 GB</a> .
