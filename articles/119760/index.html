  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to make a landing page with a conversion of more than 30% in a few minutes?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good afternoon, dear users!  I will not write a lot of introductory information, but go straight to the point.  After spending only about 10-15 minutes thinking through the concept of a landing page, I got the following results after launching a real advertising campaign: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/9f45911a/b4fd6cef/f4b2304b/257c0c2a.png"></div><br>  This is the statistics of advertising traffic.  Split testing (A / B testing) was not carried out, as this page turned out to be the most highly convertible of the entire campaign.  Conversion is the transition through the CTA-element (Call To Action) to the registration page in the service, and the transition through the LPgenerator logo to the main site. <br><br>  The landing page was created on its own <a href="http://landingpage.lpgenerator.ru/contextual-advertising">subdomain</a> for the AdWords advertising campaign for key queries: contextual advertising, [contextual advertising], contextual advertising, and so on.

It should immediately be said that this particular Landing Page collects traffic from a single advertising company, therefore it is targeted (targeted).  Any novice webmaster and web entrepreneur, not to mention more advanced users, can make and edit a page of this level. <br><br>  Page elements that attract users and give a conversion above 30%: <br><ol><li>  The title "Are you sure you are doing effective contextual advertising?".  He clings and raises some doubts, a stream of thoughts that makes one wonder, which gives rise to initial interest. </li><li>  A bit of text that makes it clear that if advertising traffic goes to the main site, then this is not good and because of this the return (conversion) is not high. </li><li>  CTA button.  There should be an inscription on such a button, which will motivate you to take the first step towards increasing conversion and revenue.  One of the important parameters, in my opinion, is the location of the call-to-action button at the top of the page (the visitor does not need to scroll the page to see it). </li></ol><br>  Important: it is statistically revealed that you only have 8 seconds to let the user perform one or another desired action.  And it really is not enough.  Look at the percentage of bounce on your site: if you have exceeded 60%, then you have a serious problem. <br><br>  Locate the 3 most important elements of the landing page, where it is a question of a product or product, it can be absolutely anyone who is not a specialist in usability.  Thanks to simple split tests, you can bring the conversion to double digits. <br><br><h4>  Why are landing pages so popular on the English-language Internet? </h4><br>  <b>If in a few words, "It just works."</b> <br><br>  Take for example the simple request ‚Äúshipping companies‚Äù on AOL and the request ‚ÄúDelivery of ebay goods‚Äù on Google.ru or Yandex.  Compare the first 3 ad results: <br><ul><li>  AOL will show that there are landing pages in all 3 first positions; </li><li>  Companies delivering products advertised in the Russian segment, throw traffic to the main pages of their sites or, at best, to the page about eBay (again on their sites). </li></ul><br>  The problem is that as a user, I initially see a very concise and understandable content advertisement in the results of my search query.  After I make a click, then, unfortunately, I get on a page filled with information that I absolutely do not need (SEO-optimized texts, various drop-down and not-so-great menus, flash banners, etc.).  This not only causes an immediate stupor, but also, as a rule, the refusal to complete what has begun (of course, not for everyone, but for many users who want to do everything quickly and without wasting time). <br><br>  Perhaps, in the West, they simply learned a little earlier how to count money spent on advertising and realized that the principle ‚ÄúThe more traffic, the better‚Äù has already passed. <br><br>  <b>Landing pages reduce the cost of each specific click.</b> <br><br>  The number of advertisers in recent years has increased significantly, and, as you know, popular contextual advertising systems are a kind of auctions, where the greater the offer, the higher the price for a keyword.  Paying up to $ 50 for each click (in super competitive niches) and not getting a buyer is not very profitable.  Landing pages increase the Quality Score (Quality Score) of your keywords, give you a higher CTR, and lower CPC. <br><br>  It is worth noting that landing pages work very well with targeted contextual and banner advertising, so it is very important to devote enough time here to build campaigns or contact specialists.  Ultimately, you pay less. <br><br>  For each specific advertising company, you must use separate landing pages. <br><br>  Transition landing pages (Clickthrough Rate) have the highest conversion, followed by leads (Lead Capture) or pages with forms to fill out (name, email, and so on).  It is useful to take into account these statistics when building an advertising campaign, and even better to check in practice using split-testing. <br><br><h4>  Afterword </h4><br>  In conclusion, a little advertising.  Obviously, my landing page was ‚Äúbuilt‚Äù on the basis of the <a href="http://lpgenerator.ru/">LPgenerator.ru</a> service, which includes all the necessary tools for this, and a useful addition in the form of split testing. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/119760/">https://habr.com/ru/post/119760/</a></p>
