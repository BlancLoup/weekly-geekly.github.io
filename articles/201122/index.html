The evolution of the hosting industry</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello! <br>  In this review article I will tell you about a unique solution in the hosting industry, which was created by simple programmers.  This is a vertical scaling of applications and a unique billing engine that allows you to make an honest calculation of the resources consumed and pay only after the resources used. <br><br>  Users who realized and appreciated how these two technologies work, with a high probability never return to the old hosting solutions based on payment for the selected limits, to the old VPS platforms. <br><br>  To begin with, I suggest that you familiarize yourself with our new video, which lists the highlights of the billing system in <a href="http://jelastic.com/">Jelastic</a> .

Those.  when an application can scale up or down, for example, by memory or processor, depending on the current load. <br><br>  We analyzed thousands of applications that run on Jelastic.  The vast majority of applications have a variable load within a single virtual machine.  Those.  All of these applications need vertical scaling.  Or in other words, they need the correct billing, in a fair calculation of the resources they consume. <br><br>  For example, in all outdated hosting platforms, very often a user buys VPS with 4GB of RAM, but in reality, 99.9% of the time it uses only half of the resources or even less.  Because it is very difficult to predict how much the application needs resources at one time or another.  Another example is when application owners very often order resources based on maximum load.  And this is correct, since I would not like to ‚Äúfall face down in the dirt‚Äù when a wave of visitors arrives and the load grows extremely fast.  But in this case, they are forced to overpay for those resources that are not used. <br><br><h3>  Flexible billing system </h3><br>  In the case of frequent variable load or when the number of required resources is not known in advance, Jelastic is the ideal solution.  Because no matter what limit you set, the billing system counts only the resources actually used by your application. <br>  However, of course, there are a number of applications and stacks for which vertical scaling either does not work (due to their peculiarities) or simply does not make sense (for example, with a very small load fluctuation). <br><br>  The video clip explains the basic principles of the Jelastic billing system.  This is a very flexible mechanism that allows you to squeeze maximum savings for your application, depending on its features. <br>  Let's analyze in detail how the billing system works.  Jelastic provides the ability to set dynamic (dynamic) and reserved (reserved) cloudlets depending on the features of your application. <br><br><img src="http://habr.habrastorage.org/post_images/73e/b25/0ca/73eb250ca25ad21d73c1961ba7994598.png" alt="Scaling limit"><br><br>  <i>Cloudlet</i> is a conditional base unit of resources, which consists of 128 MB of memory and 200 MHz CPU. <br>  <i>Dynamic cloudlets</i> - dynamic resources are paid only upon their consumption. <br>  <i>Reserved cloudlets</i> - reserved resources are cheaper, but they are always paid regardless of the fact of their consumption.  Exception if the application is stopped, then only consumed disk space is paid. <br><br><h3>  Basic setup guidelines </h3><br>  Your application has a lot of dynamics, the load is hard to predict or large and sharp load jumps are expected - use dynamic cloudlets. <br><br><img src="http://habr.habrastorage.org/post_images/c50/290/dd0/c50290dd05674f4850f994d4e81f32d4.png" alt="Dynamic cloudlets"><br><br>  If your application constantly uses the same amount of resources, or you definitely want to know how much you will need to pay at the end of the month - order only reserved cloudlets, they are cheaper. <br><br><img src="http://habr.habrastorage.org/post_images/a8d/c1e/b32/a8dc1eb32ed84c86c6d3ae6a44adc65a.png" alt="Reserved cloudlets"><br><br>  Or if your application has a part of constantly used resources and a part of dynamic ones - use the hybrid model reserved + dynamic cloudlets. <br><br><img src="http://habr.habrastorage.org/post_images/d35/f34/607/d35f346072a7f75eda4d9401be4df828.png" alt="Hybrid cloudlets"><br><br>  It is important to understand that the more you use, the greater the discount, regardless of the type of cloudlets used. <br><br>  The developed vertical scaling mechanisms and a very flexible billing system are unique developments and distinguish Jelastic from other hosting and cloud platforms.  We collected quite a lot of statistics on the use of vertical scaling by Jelastic users.  Specific examples will be published in the near foreseeable future - we are preparing materials for articles. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/201122/">https://habr.com/ru/post/201122/</a></p>
