In this topic, I would like to talk a little about the xbox live service, or rather about the ban. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, Xbox 360. This console has many advantages and also many disadvantages over other gaming platforms. <br>  You can talk about the benefits for a long time, and also for a long time to holivarit about them.  Therefore, we will not do it. <br>  But I would like to dwell on the shortcomings in more detail. <br>  <b>1. Cheap Chinese assembly</b> <br>  As you <a href="http://itnews.com.ua/33816.html">know,</a> all consoles are rejected to one degree or another.  Different users have this in different ways.  Someone plays for years and has no problems, someone struggles with errors of overheating, pressure, memory, etc. almost weekly. <br>  I am the last one, but thanks to <a href="http://xbox-experts.com/">xbox-experts.com</a> , many errors are solved by the head, the soldering iron and the screwdriver :) <br>  <b>2. The high cost of licensed discs</b> - <i>from 1000r for every crap and from 2250 for the rules of the game</i> to ... some games may be worth it, but the overwhelming majority is definitely NOT.  I absolutely do not understand the pricing policy in Russia - after all, behind the hill, the wheels are so much the same, and the income level is much higher. <br>  <b>Naturally there is some solution to this problem:</b> <br>  We reflash the drive so that it can read not only the special blanks but also the usual DVD + R DL storekeepers. <br>  Download the disc image, write it to the honestly bought in the store for 100r DVD + R DL <br>  We insert into the drive and play. <br><br>  Naturally, this is a violation of copyright, etc. etc.  But it's not about that. <br><br><h1>  LIVE </h1><br>  Microsoft has such a service - Xbox live, which allows you to download demos, buy games, movies, etc., etc. <br>  She also has a ‚ÄúGold‚Äù paid subscription that allows you to play on the Internet and receive additional opportunities from this live. <br>  A subscription to Gold costs about 220 wood per month; annual subscriptions naturally have discounts.  Together with the number of live users, this service carries non-sick grandmas in Microsoft's pocket.

    <h1>  Ban </h1><br>  Naturally, Microsoft is trying in every way to protect its offspring from hacking.  They use the ban system in live. <br>  For some factors known only to the above company, an error like ‚Äúyour console is locked‚Äù is displayed when you try to log in to live.  And that's all.  You will not be able to use more live services on this console (more precisely, on this motherboard).  Not yet invented a <s>hacking</s> solution, how to unlock the console. <br>  But it would have been a fig with him - let microsoft not get our money for Gold, but more recently (from the last <a href="http://www.xboxland.net/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D42175">wave of bans</a> , hard drives (!) <a href="http://www.xboxland.net/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D42175">Have</a> begun to block them, it is impossible to install games, all saves, etc. cannot be transferred to another console. Well at least the opportunity to persist left. <br>  At the time of this writing, there is no way to unlock the work of the hard drive ... <br><br><h6>  Please do not advise formatting the screw, etc., who do not know the essence of the question.  Ban flag is stored where it is not known, dashboard blocks work with the hard drive in the presence of this flag. </h6><br><br><h1>  The essence </h1><br>  I would like to know whether the above campaign has the right to use such measures to prevent piracy? <br>  To block access to live - please, there is a license agreement.  Do not observe - is free.  But what about the functionality of the device? <br>  I buy, for example, a new xbox ~ 10000r, I purchase a 250GB ~ ‚Äã‚Äã5000r hard drive for it, catch a ban and lose 5 kilorubbles just like that?  Zhossko. <br><br>  For example, abstracting on cars - I buy a new Porsche Cayenne, the wipers do not suit me - I‚Äôm told to put the official ones or lose the guarantee, I don‚Äôt care about losing the guarantee - I put on the cool wipers.  The next day, Porsche arrives and inserts scrap into the engine.  type you made changes to the car, the "engine" function is blocked. <br><br><h1>  Question of the day </h1><br>  <b>Does the manufacturer have the right to cut down the functionality of the devices they sell when they discover interference from outside?</b> <br><br><h6>  PS: And what will happen tomorrow?  drive lock, console?  The day after tomorrow the box can be put on the floor instead of a bedside table? </h6><br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> In general, the essence of the ban is not clear to me from the M $.  They stupidly lose money.  People even from Russia (!!!) which is not unimportant with our mentality pay them thousands and thousands for live.  How many doughs from all over the world?  Wow  A ban is just a loss ... <br>  Copyright protection?  For playing non-sweet, they do not ban, banyat for the firmware of the drive. <br>  And banyat live, and not the ability to play games ... <br><br>  <b>UPD2: All xbox users urgently copy <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/microsoft/74717/">NAND</a> !!!!</b> <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/74717/">https://habr.com/ru/post/74717/</a></p>
