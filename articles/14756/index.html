  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Pirates hit back with labels</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The owners of the Swedish site The Pirate Bay, the largest tracker for torrents, found the courage to launch an active attack on the recording industry.  The site is constantly being tried to be closed under the pretext of violating copyright rights, but, due to the peculiarities of Swedish patent law, these attempts all the time fail. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) is known for its bullying tactics (literally ‚Äúbully‚Äù).  Instead of dealing with the real causes of piracy and changing their approach to business, the association prefers to incite its lawyers against practically defenseless end users, from children to old people, condemning them to hundreds of thousands and millions of dollars.  They also like to put pressure on providers and close sites without going into details (a good example: allofmp3.com).  However, the case took a completely unexpected turn. <br><br>  The Swedes were allowed to launch an offensive by leaking the internal databases of one of the RIAA executives, MediaDefender.  All postal correspondence, information about phone calls and other juicy details of their activities over the past six months have flowed away (torrents with all this stuff are distributed to The Pirate Bay).  In the postal correspondence, there was a wipe of information about yourself in Wikipedia, and intimidation of network users, and a discussion of a fake website created to lure people to further prosecution ‚Äúby law‚Äù, and correspondence with hired hackers who hacked and disabled ‚Äúpirated sites‚Äù (for such an activity there is a definition: cyberterrorism, and Green Peace often turns out to be completely in trouble for it).  All this - from the organization, allegedly struggling with violators of the law. <br><br>  After reviewing the internal correspondence of MD and collecting enough evidence against them, The Pirate Bay went straight to the police, accusing them of spying, sabotaging and sending spam against ten local companies working for the RIAA and MD.  Among these companies are the 20th Century Fox, Sony, Paramount, Universal and others.  Given that the authorities had previously been on the side of the "pirates", the story promises to be exciting.

      PS: Swedish ‚Äúpirates‚Äù from the very beginning insisted that free copying of music is not theft and piracy, as the record industry constantly portrays it: the owner loses property during theft and piracy, while copying - no.  However, recording companies are much more profitable to call it theft - the responsibility is higher, and litigation has long been bringing them substantial money.  However, the Swedes decided not to resist, proving to everyone who is deceiving whom and where, and vice versa - to sail further under a beautiful banner donated by enemies.  They even organized a party in the local parliament, so they called it: The Pirate Party, the ‚Äúpirate party‚Äù. <br><br>  <a href="http://deadchannel.ru/story/2489">A source</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/14756/">https://habr.com/ru/post/14756/</a></p>
