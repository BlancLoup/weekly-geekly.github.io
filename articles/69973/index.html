In this article I would like to tell you more about the registration procedure itself. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Attention to all Internet users, and especially web-masters, both beginners and more experienced.  This article will help you register a beautiful domain name in beautiful areas.  The bottom line is that the hosting on which your site is located can be absolutely anything, like narod.ru, by.ru, nm.ru, or another paid or free, and the site name itself will sound like yourname.net.ru or another ending is below. <br>  Practically no one realizes this possibility, and it is not published anywhere, although it is absolutely free and requires a little time and effort from you, which we and you <br>  tell below ... <br><br>  FAQ on free registration of domain names in the zones spb.ru, msk.ru, com.ru, net.ru, pp.ru, edu.ru.

      So, you want to register the money to someone else and you want the domain to be registered to you, and not to the hoster, who can dictate their terms then (leave me - will I cover the domain) ???  Then this FAQ is for you!  All of the following is tested and works! <br>  If you need a domain name in zones <br><br>  .spb.ru / .msk.ru / .com.ru / .net.ru / .pp.ru / .edu.ru - this is completely free! <br>  All who offer money for this immediately write it down to their own profits entirely! <br>  Registration in the zone .spb.ru / .msk.ru is described in section 3.1, .com.ru / .net.ru / .pp.ru <br>  - in section 3.2, .ru / .com / .net - in section 3.3. <br>  Common steps - for all zones! <br><br>  2.1) We are registering in the RosIIROS database: <br><br>  We are going to RosHIIROS website (www.ripn.net), further on with the link "Domain registration", <br>  Next, select ‚ÄúSection for registered customers‚Äù, then ‚ÄúWeb forms for <br>  registration, "subparagraph" - individuals ".  Now we see a request for <br>  our id.  Typically, the identifier is the first letters of the last name, <br>  name and patronymic, (but I have - INFERNO [-RIPN] :)).  Press the button <br>  ‚ÄúContinue‚Äù and a form for entering our personal data opens before us.  AT <br>  Everything is commented on in Russian, therefore every field to fill in I <br>  I will not explain - just enter your data. <br>  After entering the data in the form, a request appears to indicate technical support. <br>  We will be our own technical support :): select the item "Register". <br>  Naturally, we have a form for data entry.  Again you have to choose <br>  ID (I have ASAI [-MNT-RIPN]), enter the rest of the data and click <br>  "Continue".  There was a request to indicate the contact person of the technical support service. <br>  - specify the previously selected identifier (INFERNO-RIPN), that is, we become <br>  and persona, and tech support, and her (tech support) contact person :).  After <br>  next time you click "Continue", a screen appears with the data I entered for <br>  final inspection and asking for an email notification of completion <br>  process, check the data and click the button "Register object".  AT <br>  As a result, a message was displayed on the screen that the objects were put for processing, and <br>  that after processing is completed, a notification will be sent. <br>  After a day or two, a notification comes in about entering data into the RosHIIRos database - the first stage is over :). <br><br>  2.2) It is necessary for domains in zones .ru / .com.ru / .net.ru (they are all registered <br>  not on an individual, but on the organization, although in the .ru zone it is possible on physical.  face) <br><br>  So, we‚Äôll get the ORG-RIPN organization identifier: go to <a href="http://www.ripn.net/">www.ripn.net again</a> , <br>  "Domain Registration", "Registered Customers Section", "Web Forms for <br>  registration, the sub-paragraph "organizations".  You are prompted for an ID <br>  organizations.  Choose some (ASAIS [-ORG-RIPN] :)) and again we press <br>  "Continue".  We get to the page with the form for data entry registered <br>  organizations.  Again, detailed comments are given for each field, so <br>  difficulties with filling should not be. <br><br>  Again we are waiting for the letter confirming the registration of the organization. <br><br>  2.3) Now we need DNS support (if it already exists, skip if <br>  no, or you don‚Äôt know what DNS is, do what is written here :)). <br><br>  DNS again we need free (and why pay? :)), so we go to <br>  <a href="http://www.xname.org/">www.xname.org</a> and click ‚ÄúCreate new user‚Äù.  Everything is obvious there, so we fill and <br>  Waiting for letters to activate your account.  Follow the link from the letter and then back. <br>  at <a href="http://www.xname.org/">www.xname.org</a> .  There we enter the name / password and click "Log me in!".  When page <br>  load, click ‚ÄúCreate new zone‚Äù and enter the name of the zone (for example, weblinks.spb.ru) <br>  and note the switch "primary".  We press "Create", and then "modification <br>  interface ".  Now you need to configure the zone to work :). <br><br>  In the block ‚ÄúName server (NS) records‚Äù enter ns.secondary.net.ua.  (with a dot !!!); <br>  in the "Computers allowed to do zone transfers" block, enter <br>  193.201.116.2; 193.124.22.65; <br>  in the block ‚ÄúAddress (A) records‚Äù in the fields ‚Äúname‚Äù we enter the name.zones.s. with a dot. at the end. <br>  :) (for example, weblinks.spb.ru.) and www (without a dot).  What ip-address to enter? <br>  See section 4.0! <br><br>  Enter the ip-addresses, click "generate zone configuration" and wait until we <br>  A notification will come from the xname server. <br><br>  Now you need to register a second DNS server.  Go to <a href="http://www.secondary.com.ua/">www.secondary.com.ua</a> and <br>  Click the link "add".  Enter our domain name (weblinks.spb.ru), NIC source = <br>  RIPN, nic-hdl is the identifier received in RosIrIros (INFERNO-RIPN), <br>  IP address of the 1st primary DNS = 195.20.105.149, Allow xfer - tick. <br>  We press the button and wait for the letter from the server - it will send the password.  How did you get the password? <br>  go back to secondary.net.ua and click ‚Äúedit‚Äù.  Enter the name of the zone <br>  (weblinks.spb.ru) and the received password.  Now we need to do the only thing - put a tick ¬´Activate¬ª and click OK.  Everything!  (just have to wait somewhere <br>  hour to update the server ns.secondary.net.ua) <br><br>  3.1) Registration in .spb.ru / .msk.ru zones <br><br>  We write a letter to the address noc-dns@relcom.net (arbitrary topic): <br><br>  domain: weblinks.msk.ru <br>  descr: WebLinks site <br>  admin-c: INFERNO-RIPN <br>  zone-c: INFERNO-RIPN <br>  tech-c: INFERNO-RIPN <br>  nserver: ns0.xname.org 195.20.105.149 <br>  nserver: ns.secondary.net.ua 193.201.116.2 <br>  changed: mymail@mail.ru 20030627 <br>  source: RIPN <br><br>  in the changed field - the current date in the format yyyymmchch, the other fields are obvious :) <br>  Now we are waiting for the results - and your domain! <br><br>  3.2) Registration in .com.ru / .net.ru / .pp.ru zones <br><br>  Go to <a href="http://www.ripn.net/">www.ripn.net</a> , the section "Domain Registration", then "the third level in <br>  zones .COM.RU, .NET.RU, .ORG.RU, .PP.RU ‚Äù, and further‚Äú domains ‚Äù.  Choose a "person" <br>  in the first window, enter the identifier from clause 2.1 and your password or email.  Further <br>  fill in the proposed fields (if we register the .pp.ru domain, then the admin-o field <br>  it is not necessary to change, but in all other cases we change it to an identifier <br>  organizations of p.2.3).  In the "nserver" enter: <br>  ns0.xname.org [space] 195.20.105.149 [enter] ns.secondary.net.ua. [space] 193.201.116 <br>  .2 - everything.  The ‚Äútype‚Äù field is not changed.  We press the button "register a domain" and just <br>  waiting for a letter of confirmation. <br><br>  3.3) Registration in the zone .ru / .com / .net <br><br>  Go to <a href="http://www.nic.ru/">www.nic.ru</a> , enter the domain name that we want to register and <br>  Click OK.  If the domain is free, then click the first button "continue".  In the field "name" <br>  we enter ns0.xname.org and ns.secondary.net.ua, and in "ip" 195.20.105.149 and <br>  193.201.116.2, respectively, and click "continue" and then, again, "continue". <br>  Select "Get data from RosHIIROS" and choose "organization" / "person" (in <br>  depending on whom the domain is registered with), enter the appropriate <br>  ID and email / password, click "get data" and then "transfer <br>  data".  we flush the questionnaire down, enter the password and check the box ‚ÄúI remember <br>  password".  Click "send the questionnaire".  We remember the jumped-in number of the questionnaire. <br>  Press the button "Checkout".  Now we are told that the order will arrive in <br>  processing under the condition of an agreement with RU-CENTER and in the presence of <br>  sufficient amount on the personal account of our contract.  It will also be given the opportunity <br>  to issue an invoice for the ordered services.  First, we will write out the invoice, for which we will click <br>  the button "Issue invoice", not forgetting to check the correctness of the amount.  After clicking we <br>  Let's go to the next page, where we will be notified that we have been billed, and <br>  will offer to print a copy for payment.  We will do that and then we will go. <br>  printed invoice to pay :) Just do not forget that legal entities <br>  should pay with VAT.  Now we are RU-CENTER clients and we can, <br>  using the contract number and password, view your data on the server.  Has come <br>  time to directly conclude a contract.  Go to the server RU-CENTER <br>  (http://www.nic.ru/), we are looking for the item ‚ÄúFor customers‚Äù on the right, we go in and see the field <br>  request the contract number and password, and below - a few items.  One of them is ‚ÄúConclude an agreement‚Äù.  Go to this address, load a contract form <br>  for a legal entity / individual, fill in, print in duplicate and <br>  we send by regular mail (along with a copy of the certificate of State <br>  registration of a legal entity, if we register it) in RU-CENTER.  Address <br>  specified in the description ‚ÄúHow to conclude a legal contract <br>  face ‚Äù, which is where we took the form of the contract. <br>  How to find ip site? <br><br>  If it is hosted on a paid hosting, then ask the hoster, ask it <br>  set up a virtual host for your name (www.weblinks.spb.ru and <br>  weblinks.spb.ru - for both addresses!).  If the site lies on some <br>  narod.ru, or nm.ru, then specify the following ip: 66.93.172.108.  Then go to <br>  <a href="http://www.publicredirect.com/">www.publicredirect.com</a> , select ‚ÄúAdd‚Äù and enter the address from which <br>  made a redirect (weblinks.spb.ru), and where (weblinks.nm.ru), as well as <br>  password.  Cloaked redirect type - weblinks.nm.ru page will be loaded into <br>  frame, and in the address bar of the browser will be weblinks.spb.ru.  Type standart - frames will not, but in the address bar will be weblinks.nm.ru. <br><br>  Copyright by WebLinks 2003 <br>  Thanks to the authors. <br>  <a href="http://xpoint.ru/know-how/Bol%27shayaPomoyka/Raznoe/BesplathayaRegistraciyaDomennihImjen">Original article</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/69973/">https://habr.com/ru/post/69973/</a></p>
