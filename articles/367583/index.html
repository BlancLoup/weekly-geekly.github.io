Part 2</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e4f/d91/965/e4fd91965e7148e3b303c9d96617b454.jpg">  Greetings to everyone again.  In the last article I talked about how to add realism to FPV flights at the expense of video glasses with the function of 3d pictures.  Today I will continue this topic, talking about the synchronization of camera and head movements.  So, so that during the flight we did not look at one point, but could also look around a little, we need a device such as HeadTracker.  Now the head tracker is often installed in FPV glasses (for example, fatshark or those that we considered in the <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/dronk/blog/269018/">previous article</a> - SkyzoneSKY-02).  However, I think everyone noticed that these glasses are worth a lot.  So is it possible to make ‚Äúcamera head control‚Äù cheaper?  Or, let's say you already have a video send with the best picture than wearing glasses, and you just want to add HeadTracker to them?  The answer is yes! <br><br><hr><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>To control the camera, I will use QuanumHeadTracker.</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c6d/e08/abc/c6de08abc02643136a704b00f74f5cb0.jpg" alt="image">

      However, this is not the only model that the market offers.  As stated by the manufacturer - this model is not ‚Äúdrift‚Äù and clearly holds the position.  In this article, I will not compare the trackers themselves, but just tell you what I have chosen, and write "what they eat with."  Looking ahead, I will say that this ‚Äútechnology‚Äù is better suited to copters of at least 400 class, so that it can be installed under the camera suspension.  That is, it's still not for racing quadrics. <br><br>  <b>So, the principle of the tracker.</b> <br><br>  For its operation, we need only a copter with a suspension and a camera, and a control panel with a port for the ‚Äútrainer‚Äù (for example, turnigy 9xr, in which there are 2 ports, analogs of JR and Futaba). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fe8/133/4c6/fe81334c6a1223391087d864a49eae80.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The headtracker itself is connected to one of the ports through the wire that comes in the kit, and as it were ‚Äúwedged in‚Äù into the control.  Through the gyroscope, he "understands" which way the head tilts, unless of course you put it on some other place.  And through the transmitter gives a signal to the receiver, which, in turn, and directs the suspension. <br><br>  However, from my own experience, I will tell about one nuance ... I initially wanted to make control of the camera through 3 servo drives.  That is, the camera rotates along the pitch, roll and yaw axes.  But then I realized that the whole structure would be rigidly fixed on the copter, and when it is tilted at the time of flight, it will bend with it, regardless of "your head."  Yes, camera control through the tracker will be, but a plus to everything will be added oscillations of the copter, which will kill all sensations.  To prevent this from happening, it is better to install a suspension with separate brains.  For example, such a suspension for cameras like Gopro.  By happy coincidence, I just had a copter capable of such a gimbal with a camera.  Because of the relatively large weight (suspension + Gopro), we need a quadric more ‚Äúhigh-torque‚Äù than a racing one. <br><br>  So, we have a gimbal that is able to stabilize the camera along 3 axes regardless of the ‚Äútilts of the copter‚Äù, and in addition we can control the grip with our own head, ‚Äúnot distracting‚Äù our hands from controlling the quadric.  In principle, this way you can shoot a good video, because often one operator-pilot is not able to immediately control both the flight and the camera (if there is any dynamic scene).  A few settings and get this: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/fkP8lJKWqpk%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjHr8lycTmYaowHj6PL8rm8qxThYg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The smoothness and angles of rotation of the suspension relative to the tracker are configured in the software that goes to the suspension itself (to its brains) in the RC settings section.  However, there is one drawback, I think.  The viewing angle with the tracker is only 180 degrees on all axes.  In other words, we can look left, right, up and down, but in order to look back, we need to deploy the copter.  Of course, you can adjust it so that when you turn your head 180 degrees, the camera will turn 360 degrees, but this will already be visually unnatural.  However, flying, I realized that this is not important.  The main factor here was the sensation.  Especially when you lay a turn on a quadric and tilt your head to the side, you can really fall to the ground.  Therefore, it is better to take with you on what you can sit.  :) <br><br>  As a result, we got a kind of ocular rift for full immersion in FPV flight <b>costing up to 25 thousand rubles</b> : <br><ul><li>  Helmet OCDAY 3D FPV 5.8G 32CH - <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/98">$ 225.94 (~ $ 17 210.54)</a> <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/dronk/blog/367583/">*</a> </li><li>  Quanum 3 Axis No Drift Tracker - <a href="http://dronworld.ru/fpv_telemetry/quanum_3_axis_no_drift_head_tracker.html">1 360 rub.</a> </li><li>  3-axis suspension - <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/99">$ 77.54 (~ 5,906.46 rubles)</a> <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/dronk/blog/367583/">*</a> </li></ul><br>  That's all, with you there was a simple service for selecting complex technology <a href="https://dronk.ru/">Dronk.Ru</a> <br>  Do not forget to subscribe to our <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/dronk/blog/">blog</a> , there will be many more interesting things. <br><a name="ref"></a><br>  ps * - links marked with an asterisk referral, so you can save money by returning cashback up to 4%.
