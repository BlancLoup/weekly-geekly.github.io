Correct if I'm wrong.  Not a single ruble was spent on advertising and website promotion.  The site was launched without traffic sources. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  It all started on the morning of February 8 with the news release on Channel One.  In the monotonous bubnezhe I was attracted by the news about the talismans of the Sochi 2014 Olympiad.  Listened to the news.  Left for work.  I sit, go about my business.  And the network boils up.  Everyone is discussing candidates for talismans. <br><br>  In the news on the First talked about the popular vote for the talisman.  I went to the official site <a href="http://talisman.sochi2014.ru/">http://talisman.sochi2014.ru/</a> .  Voting was not found there.  On the site of the First Channel, it turned out that the voting will be held on February 26 via SMS and phone calls (I think we should pay). <br><br>  For some reason, the Organizing Committee of the Olympiad decided to work only with a television audience.  I wanted to correct this injustice and work with the Internet audience.  After all, the Internet audience is already equal to the television.  The most interesting thing for me is to compare the choice of the Internet and the television audience. <br><br>  On the same day, February 8, <a href="http://www.onlyweb.ru/">our team</a> gathered a site-voting for talismans using social buttons and hung up Dicqus to discuss everything that happens.  The site is located at <a href="http://talismansochi2014.ru/">talismansochi2014.ru</a> (for some reason, such a beautiful domain was not busy).  It took 4 hours from the idea to the appearance of the site on the network. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/773/c22/9ca/773c229ca334dc0805bfd4ddb079466b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It was necessary to attract the first visitors.  A colleague and I spent about 3 hours to sow a link to the site.  Commented in LJ, on news sites, in VKontakte groups. <br><br>  Already on February 9 the first visitors went to the site.  Thanks to an unusual voting model with the help of accounts in social networks, more and more new users began to come to the site.  Initially, under each candidate for talismans there were three button likes: Fesbuk, Twitter and VKontakte.  The total number of votes was not automatically counted.  Not a very elegant solution but effective. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ab6/44f/f25/ab644ff25f7607b2059d77b433fcb57d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Our predictions on attendance were 40-60 thousand unique visitors per day.  On the first day 19 360 users came to the site.  On the second day 56 291 users.  Yandex metric predicted a frantic thousand percent increase in visitors.  It alerted us, and we moved the website <a href="http://talismansochi2014.ru/">talismansochi2014.ru</a> to a separate hosting.  As it turned out, for good reason.  On February 12, 190,093 users visited the site. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e7c/4a3/39a/e7c4a339ae3ad8c585d3f33d5f39b13b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  We read the comments.  Very often mentions about <a href="http://zhgun.livejournal.com/364861.html">Zoich</a> Yegor Zhgun and <a href="http://turbomilk.ru/portfolio/characters/olympic-mascot/">Mittens</a> from Turbomilka slipped.  For the fan, we decided to add Zoycha and Mittens to the vote. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c49/784/fed/c49784fed013793b790f458d04298f45.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  People continued to go to the site, but there was a problem - not everyone understood how to vote and every talisman did not have a total number of votes.  We solved this problem - on the site <a href="http://talismansochi2014.ru/">http://talismansochi2014.ru/</a> there appeared a normal ‚ÄúVote‚Äù button and each candidate automatically counted the sum of likes for VKontakte, Twitter and Facebook. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/05c/158/f8e/05c158f8e2346e7ebfc93ecd2075c5a1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  When you click on the "Vote" button, a window pops up in which you can like. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cdd/b1f/9ef/cddb1f9ef68c1b8765f96369b0b3f983.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  After the simplification of the voting mechanism, the process of expressing opinions has become more active.  On February 25, at 11.22 Moscow time, 383,921 users voted.  On Twitter, it looked very funny.  Tweets with a vote appeared every few seconds. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9de/9c6/12b/9de9c612b9f6d50e51786762458aa176.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Of course, the voting system is not perfect.  You can vote for one candidate as many times as you want using social media accounts.  You can first vote for one candidate for talismans, and then for another.  Now we have started the project <a href="http://sociatop.ru/">http://sociatop.ru/</a> , which will implement the mechanism of voting with the help of accounts in social networks and will be deprived of the majority of the above-mentioned shortcomings. <br><br>  In my opinion, even with such obvious lack of voting <a href="http://talismansochi2014.ru/">http://talismansochi2014.ru/</a> shows real sympathy for the Internet audience. <br><br>  A number of media outlets wrote about the project.  About the <a href="http://talismansochi2014.ru/">site mentioned</a> even one very respected publication - Kommersant Power.  We expected that we would receive angry letters demanding to cover the site.  There were no letters.  There is democracy in the country.  It is a pity that our site-voting does not solve anything. <br><br>  We did not earn anything on the site <a href="http://talismansochi2014.ru/">http://talismansochi2014.ru/</a> (and we did not set ourselves such a goal).  The purpose of the project is to compare the opinions of television and Internet audiences.  Looking forward to the 26th.  After the end of the broadcast at 23.10 we will draw conclusions.  I wonder if there will be more voters on Channel One than on the site. <br><br>  Who do you think will win?  With which talisman will our country hold the 2014 Sochi Olympics?  I am happy to answer questions in the comments or email me at <a href="http://vlasov%40onlyweb.ru/">vlasov@onlyweb.ru</a> <br><br><habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/114499/">https://habr.com/ru/post/114499/</a></p>
