For paperwork, it can be difficult to find time, especially at the very beginning, before your business moves to a solid foundation.  Nevertheless, the paper gimp is very important.  Scoring on the reporting and financial documents today, you risk running into trouble tomorrow. <br><br>  In our country, this problem is highly relevant and more significant than in the west.  Considering bureaucratic traditions and neglect of small business as a whole, ignoring this part of the business can lead to extremely unpleasant consequences.  The confusion in financial documentation brought small and medium-sized businesses much more problems than any other troubles.  Bookkeeping is a completely unbearable "lady", and when she suffers a lack of attention, a business begins to experience many problems of a very different nature. <br><br>  In this article I would like to give some recommendations for start-up entrepreneurs. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Plan all expenses </h4><br>  As a rule, any large expenses can be planned long before their implementation.  So that planning costs can not be neglected.  Most often, you do not need to hire an individual specialist, but in your diary on the first page there should be records of the planned capital expenditures and all your decisions and actions should take them into account.  Most companies need to update their information infrastructure at least once every five years.  For workers in the industry more often, for all others - less.  The schedule of these costs should be made at least a year in advance, and a gradual implementation plan is very desirable (this month we will buy new bespereboynik, and next may be replace the server).  This approach allows you not to get <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/18280/">into a situation of forced total updates</a> .  Even if no infrastructure costs are planned in the current period, funds should be planned and accumulated.

      If you are worried about the temptation to spend the accumulated money, try to collect these funds on a separate account, which will not permanently hurt your eyes.  The less often you see him, the less temptation.  In the same way you can do with other mandatory recurring costs. <br><br><h4>  Separate work and personal accounts </h4><br>  This advice may seem obvious simple, but for a new business, it can be difficult to implement, at least to the best of habit.  It seems like you are the owner and all your funds are yours, but nothing will cause your business to collapse faster than mixing personal and business expenses (went to the cashier - stole from yourself).  In any case, it is easier to conduct business records separately, you can sell or lose a business, and you will not sell or lose personal accounts. <br><br>  As a business owner, you will face a situation where your personal life will try to invade your work.  Work car is very easy to track mileage and technical costs, but if you often use a working vehicle for personal purposes, the calculation is much more complicated.  In such cases, try to use the experience of bureaucratic state "monsters", fix each trip separately.  Today, there are 100,500 ways to do this, ranging from the simplest use of online maps to specialized applications. <br><br><h4>  Do not brake, paper is not everything </h4><br>  Take advantage of modern technology - do not hesitate.  If there is even the slightest opportunity to automate something - automate. <br><br><h4>  Set up separate accounts </h4><br>  In addition to advice on the separation of work and personal accounts, you can also share some of your work accounts.  The practice of separating an account for payroll and savings accounts for the following planned capital expenditures has proven itself well.  It would be nice to have a separate account for daily expenses, and if possible, one emergency savings account in case of unforeseen trouble. <br><br><h4>  Schedule bookkeeping time </h4><br>  How to avoid an accounting disaster?  Just add this work to your schedule.  Most often, entrepreneurs leave such work at the end of the week or at the beginning of a new payment period. <br><br>  No one likes bookkeeping.  ‚ÄúTechies‚Äù are notable for their dislike for this worthy craft, which sometimes forget about the exceptional importance of well-functioning accounting for businesses of all sizes.  If you do not want to deal with it, find an outside specialist.  The trouble is that an intelligent accountant can cost a lot of obscene money, so for small companies it makes sense to independently learn and apply this skill.  I hope these few tips will prove useful for beginners.  Thanks for attention! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/293872/">https://habr.com/ru/post/293872/</a></p>
