Thank. <br><br>  In 2011, Ivan Okhlobystin wrote the text "Thunderstorm", which became the basis for the movie of the same name, developed in <a href="http://trailerss.ru/">Trailer Studio.</a>  The video was dedicated to the literary evening "Doctrine of 77", the main role in it was played by actor Vadim Demchog. <br><br>  The Thunderstorm has been viewed over 2 million times.  And, thanks to her, the Studio was <a href="http://www.pausefest.com.au/studio-trailers-rus/">celebrated</a> at the international video design festival.  You can also read comments on this video on <a href="https://vimeo.com/32700319">our vimeo channel</a> .  It is worth noting that these are comments not by ordinary viewers, but by professional communities.  This can be easily seen by going to the profile of almost any commentator.

It was decided to increase the scale and complexity several times, closely approaching the cinema.  The duration of the video increased to 10 minutes. <br><br>  August 10 was the first and main shooting day.  The director was again made by the author of this post, and the main role was invariably played out by Vadim Demchog. <br><br><img src="http://trailerss.ru/assets/drgalleries/197/big_1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Breaking Dawn, like the previous video, is a non-commercial project.  Trailers Studio conducts its development at its own expense, attracting volunteers of different specializations.  Together, we want to prove that technologically in Russia it is possible to make large-scale genre films, and not just disgusting ‚Äúgood cinema‚Äù for unkind money. <br><br>  As part of the work on this project, we are working on technologies and forming a team in order to shoot not a third part in a year, but already a full-fledged cinema. <br><br><img src="http://trailerss.ru/assets/drgalleries/197/big_2.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In the "Dawn" laid a large number of complex computer graphics.  These are not separate flying lights, as it was in the first part, but a full-fledged destroyed city with minor CG characters.  To realize the picture at a decent cinematic level, serious investments are required in the rendering of the visual series, in other words, in the ‚Äúrender‚Äù.  This is either renting a render or buying them.  The latter is more profitable, since for the following projects we will not need such investments. <br><br>  And so, we come to the essence of this post.  According to preliminary estimates, the render will cost 20-25 thousand dollars.  That is how much we want to collect in sponsored places in the video.  If we spend less or collect more, the money will go to pay for the work of volunteers. <br><br>  The video contains <b>4 large sponsor places</b> worth 5 thousand dollars each.  All 4 sponsors are displayed on one screen at the end of the video before captions, and are displayed long enough so that you can see the names of companies, website addresses and short descriptions of the activities of each sponsor.  The ‚Äúbig‚Äù sponsor also receives: <br><ol><li>  placing a link to your site in the description on youtube.com right under the video; </li><li>  placing a link to the sponsor's website in the description on youtube.com immediately under the ‚Äúfilm about the film‚Äù; </li><li>  placing a link to the sponsor's website in all official publications of the Trailer Studio of this video on any sites, and, of course, warm words on our part; </li><li>  the video itself in the original quality; </li><li>  <b>30% discount</b> on the development of a commercial in the Trailers Studio, that is, half of the investment will be returned to you. </li></ol><br><br>  One large sponsorship site has already been purchased.  The inscription ‚Äúottuda.ru‚Äù flashed on for a quarter of a second in the first video and still brings traffic in such quantity that the site owner bought out one sponsor‚Äôs place immediately after learning about the sequel. <br><br>  In addition to the large, the video provides for <b>7 sponsor places worth $ 1000</b> .  They will be displayed in a list parallel to the titles.  The screen will be divided into two parts: titles on the left, sponsors on the right.  Two lines indicate the address of the site and its activities.  In order for the audience to see the titles to the end, from time to time they will be interrupted by short flashes, revealing an additional plot of the video.  In addition, the sponsor receives a 15% discount on the development of the video in Trailer Studio (this is a little more than $ 1000). <br><br>  And, following the covenants of Freeman, there is also a Tsar-sponsor.  A company that has invested $ 10,000 in development will be able to place its logo at the beginning of the video with a separate screen, along with the logo of the Trailers Studio.  Also, the King-sponsor will receive another unusual bonus, which we will only tell about this company. <br><br><img src="http://trailerss.ru/assets/drgalleries/197/big_3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  With each sponsor we sign a contract, where the obligations of the parties are clearly stated.  Also, all sponsors will receive a ticket to the premiere of "Dawn" in the Planetarium. <br><br>  The premiere of the video is scheduled for the second half of November, but the cost of sponsorship will increase. <br><br>  If you want to take part in this project, please contact me at trailerss@gmail.com.  In the comments answer questions that do not fit in the main topic of the post.  I will also be very grateful for the dissemination of this information. <br><br>  Innokenty Skirnevsky </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/150998/">https://habr.com/ru/post/150998/</a></p>
