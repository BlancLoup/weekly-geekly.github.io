  <section class="page js-page"><h1>AI integration with the human brain</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Actually I am reading a fairly well-known article by Ray Kurzweil, ‚ÄúThe Merging of a Man with a Machine,‚Äù and I think that I would gladly agree if I were given the opportunity to slow down the progress of scientific and technological progress.  I fully understand that NTP is necessary for the development of mankind as a whole, but how sometimes you do not want the notorious changes.  Next, I present several excerpts from this article, I am interested in your opinion on the potential possibility of what Kurzweil describes. <a name="habracut"></a><br><blockquote>  Let's take as a point of reference the year 2029 and bring together some of the trends that I talked about.  By that time, we will be able to design nanobots, microscopic robots that can penetrate into your capillaries and travel through your brain, studying it from the inside.  We can almost create schemes of this kind now.  We cannot yet make them small enough, however we can make them rather small.  The Ministry of Defense is developing tiny robot devices called ‚Äúsmart dust‚Äù.  The size of these devices today is one millimeter.  This is still too much for our scenario, but these crumbs can be dropped from the aircraft, and they can find the necessary positions with high accuracy.  You can have thousands of these devices in a wireless LAN.  They can take visual images, communicate with each other, coordinate, send messages, act as practically invisible spies and be used to perform many military tasks. <br><br>  ... <br><br>  For complete immersion in virtual reality, we will send billions of these nanobots so that they are located at every nerve fiber emanating from all of our senses.  If you want to stay in true reality, they will just sit on their seats and do nothing.  If you want to go into virtual reality, they will begin to suppress the signals coming from your real senses, and they will replace them with signals that you would receive while in a virtual environment.

      With such a scheme, we will receive virtual reality from the inside, and it will be able to reproduce all our sensations.  It will be a collective environment in which it will be possible to enter both one person and many people.  A visit to a web site will mean getting into a virtual reality environment, encompassing all of our feelings, and not only from the five basic feelings, but also emotions, sexual satisfaction, and humor.  In fact, the neurological correlates of all these sensations and emotions, which I discuss in the book ‚ÄúThe Age of the Spiritual Machines‚Äù, already exist. <br><br>  When you talk to someone in 2040, it may be that the mental activity of your interlocutor of biological origin will be a hybrid of biological and electronic types of thinking that are closely related to each other.  Instead of being limited to just a hundred trillion compounds in our brain, as is the case now, we can significantly exceed this level.  The speed of our biological thinking is fixed: it is believed that a person can perform 1026 calculations per second, and this biologically given number is not going to increase spontaneously.  However, the abilities of non-biological intelligence increase exponentially.  According to my calculations, the critical point will come in the 2030s;  some call it a transition point. <br><br>  When we get to 2050, the main part of our thinking, which, in my opinion, is still synonymous with human civilization, will have a non-biological character.  I do not consider the deadly clash of hostile artificial intelligence with human, which is reflected in The Matrix, as an unavoidable scenario.  The non-biological part of our thinking will still remain human, because it will be derived from biological thinking.  It will be developed by people or machines created by people, or machines built on the basis of engineering analysis of the human brain or the loading of human thinking, or on the basis of one of many other possible variants of a close symbiosis between human thinking and machine thinking that we cannot even think Today. <br><br>  The usual reaction to these assumptions is how gloomy it is, since I "put humanity on the same level as machines."  However, this reaction is due to the fact that most people have a prejudice against cars.  Most experts do not really represent what cars are ultimately capable of, since all the machines that they have ever ‚Äúencountered‚Äù are very limited compared to people.  However, this will not apply to cars of the year 2030 or 2040.  When machines become a derivative of human intelligence, which is also a million times more capable than man, we will begin to respect them, and the obvious distinction between human intelligence and machine intelligence will disappear.  We really merge with our technology. <br><br>  We are already going this way.  If cars all over the world would stop, our civilization could collapse on the amount of hard, tedious work today.  More recently, thirty years ago, this would not have happened.  In 2040, human intelligence and machine intelligence will be very closely soldered.  We will be able to experience much stronger sensations of the most diverse kind.  We will be able to ‚Äúrecreate the world‚Äù created by our imagination and penetrate into different environments, just as amazing as in ‚ÄúThe Matrix‚Äù.  One can only hope that this world will be more open to the creative self-expression of man and his experiences. <br></blockquote><br>  <a href="http://alt-future.narod.ru/Future/kurzweil.htm">Full article</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/6934/">https://habr.com/ru/post/6934/</a></p>
