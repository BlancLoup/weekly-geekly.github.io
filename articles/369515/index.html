Players have mastered only a small part of the largest gaming space with 400,000,000,000 stars.  Developers have repeatedly stated that in the course of mastering the game universe, gamers will encounter strange objects.  Most of these objects in a nameless galaxy, which so far no one has found.  But the oddities have already begun to appear. <br><br>  Unidentified artifacts (‚Äúunknown artifacts‚Äù) occur to players for several months.  They are found mainly near the Merope star system, within 50 light years from the star.  These <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/07/elite-dangerous-players-inch-closer-to-solving-games-big-mystery/">artifacts transmit strange messages to</a> ships that are better suited for scanning.  Messages are encoded, and now a group of players have managed to decode them - it turns out, these are images of the spaceships of the players themselves.  Artifacts, as far as can be judged, cause problems when trying to assemble them - some systems fail, sometimes entire space stations stop working.  This happens if the artifact is sold on the black market station.  All this is more or less known.  But now there is a second type of unknown objects. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  These artifacts are called "unknown probes" ("unknown probe"), and found them very recently.  They appear next to the planet in the star system Merope, which is called Merope 5C.  When you try to study the probes, they begin to behave very strangely.

After the probe is attempted to be studied using a scanner, the unknown device starts to glow, and the player's ship is temporarily turned off while the message is being transmitted by the probe.  And the messages are different from everything that was received earlier. <br><br>  A number of players subjected the probe to spectrographic analysis, and the result was an image like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3ce/c8e/3bf/3cec8e3bfe925e746ba081e9c54145cf.jpg"><br><br>  Images encrypted in audio messages are not uncommon for games; earlier this was done by the Doom developers.  After cleaning the image of unnecessary details, you get this chart: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1c9/4fa/802/1c94fa8024d23145b4e0b3883e91a456.jpg"><br><br>  Members of Cannon Research's research team and some other players agree that the characters on the edges of the diagram are binary numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4. But it remains unclear what the diagram itself means.  Probes are found around the planet Merope 5C, this is understandable.  The diagram shows a sphere - maybe this is a pointer to the landing point on the planet?  Instructions for players to search for something in a certain place? <br><br>  Now some players are of the opinion that Thargoids will appear soon.  It is an insectoid interplanetary race, the first contact with which ended in conflict.  In appearance, the targoids are erect creatures, much taller than normal human growth, having transparent, whitish bodies.  Speech and language is poorly amenable to study and deciphering, it is possible that it is based on certain mathematical laws.  There is no exact information about any state structure of targoids in the usual sense.  <a href="http://ru.elite-dangerous.wikia.com/wiki/%25D0%25A2%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B4%25D1%258B">It is assumed</a> that due to the high social organization of their individuals are divided into classes. <br><br>  Targoids are superior to humanity in the use of advanced AI, as well as in their use in ship systems ... Other areas of technology, such as metallurgy, biogenetics, physics, and weapon systems are so perfect that scientists of humanity do not always understand what principles they are made and how they work.  Their hyperdrives and shield technologies also surpass all known human counterparts. <br><br>  Are targos hidden somewhere near Merope 5C, waiting for people to get to them?  Will people be able to cooperate with this race, or is it a trap that will lead to war?  Will they come at all, or are they already here? <br><br>  So far, there are no answers to these questions, but the developers say that the players will have to find the answers to all these questions themselves. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/369515/">https://habr.com/ru/post/369515/</a></p>
