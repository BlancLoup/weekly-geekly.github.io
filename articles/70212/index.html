  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Warranty service for iPhone from M-Video with Megaphone smack</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I was lucky to buy an iPhone for 9900 in M-Video. But the joy did not last long.  The phone persistently lost the network after exactly 5 minutes of talking or using GPS.  I tried everything possible - it did not help, but that's not the point.  Decided to carry in the repair <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  In M-Video, they kicked me from one store to another and concluded that they were not engaged in repairs, they wouldn't accept it under warranty, and there was nothing to exchange it for, because  all sold out.  Yes, and you will not be anyone to change the phone, bought for the 9900 for a new one, which costs 22,000. The maximum that they can - return the money.  One of the workers really advised me to contact directly one of the three operators (thanks, my friend!), Because  All official iPhones were delivered through them, and accordingly, only operators have contracts with Apple.  And it's no secret that just megaphone iPhones were selling in M-Video. <br>  I went to the branch of MegaFon to find out if my iphone will be guaranteed by me. <br><br>  - Hello, is it possible for you to hand over a phone purchased in another store under warranty? <br>  - No, we only accept phones that are purchased from Megaphone.  Although ... you did not accidentally buy it in M-Video? <br>  - Yes, in M-Video. <br>  - Just a minute ... <br>  A phone call to a friend, after which they tell me that everything is OK, you can bring the phone, with a check and warranty card.

      I must say that I have no warranty card (by the way, am I the only one or have they not been discharged to anyone?), Because  when selling, I was told that "check guarantee". <br><br>  The next day I bring a complete set with a check to Megaphone, but I hear from the doorway: <br>  - No, no, we have updated the instructions, we no longer accept iPhones from M-Video.  Only those that are bought from us.  Moreover, you do not have a warranty card.  Maybe you have it at all counterfeit. <br>  - Well, hello, you yourself yesterday told me to bring what happened during the night? <br>  - Update instructions.  Everything, young man, go to M-Video, I will not accept your phone. <br><br>  Well, I think, come.  M-Video knows nothing, Megaphone knows, but does nothing.  I will collect written refusals from everyone, perhaps I'll start with you. <br><br>  - So be it, write to me then a written refusal that you do not accept from me under the guarantee of the iPhone, because I bought it not from you. <br>  - No, that you, I have no authority to write written refusals.  <sup>(IMHO nonsense)</sup> <br>  - Well, you also have the authority to verbally refuse me, why is it difficult for you to subordinate your words on paper? <br>  - Now I will call, find out if I have the authority to write written refusals. <br><br>  Call a friend, after which they offer me to write a statement describing the situation.  They promise to consider the application. <br>  I'm starting to write.  I ask "in whose name to write?  To whom?  Call a friend again.  This time about 10 minutes. I am still writing a statement. <br><br>  <sup>I must say that at first glance it turns out that Megaphone really has nothing to do with my situation.</sup>  <sup>I had to deal with M-Video.</sup>  <sup>And I really did not fully believe that Megaphone owed me anything.</sup>  <sup>But at a second glance, after reading the law on consumer protection (interesting reading matter, by the way), it turns out that Megaphone, as an importer, is still responsible for my iPhone.</sup>  <sup>Indeed, Apple has not organized in the Russian Federation its representative office and service centers that can provide warranty service for iPhones.</sup>  <sup>Most likely, there are some provisions in the Apple contract with our operators that the warranty obligations for iPhones lie with our operators.</sup>  <sup>M-Video, in turn, has no relationship with Apple on iPhones.</sup>  <sup>In theory, M-Videos should have received an iPhone under my warranty and sent it to Megaphone.</sup> <br><br>  Apparently, there is some truth in these thoughts, because  a few minutes later they came up to me and said ‚Äúcome on, don't write a statement already.  Now we will make out. <br><br>  They struck a serial on their base, the phone really turned out to be Megafonovsky, they scanned the barcode - it also came up. <br>  In the end, was taken to the repair, which is given 45 days. <br>  I think that according to the old Russian tradition I will receive an answer not earlier than the 44th day :) <br><br>  What conclusions did I draw for myself? <br>  Yes, no.  I would only get the phone back working. <br><br>  PS In spite of everything, I express my gratitude to the staff of Megaphone.  It is a pity that not without a wrangle, but still they helped me.  I think the fuss with M-Video, as with the direct seller, I would have taken more time and effort. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/70212/">https://habr.com/ru/post/70212/</a></p>
