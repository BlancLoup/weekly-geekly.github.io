People come to Gender / Zamu / Glavbukh weekly (or even daily) with a burning gaze and enthusiastically tell about the wonders of such a system, showing beautiful polygraphy.  Saul happiness, joy, kickbacks and trips to the resorts.  Call loud names and brands.  Contract signed. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <u>Act I</u> - people with burning eyes begin to implant.  Conduct training for staff, show slides, draw tables.  They are terrified of how the enterprise works, they promise that this horror will soon end and universal happiness will come.  All questions are answered that "everything will be, and even more," details are avoided.  The staff frowns suspiciously, but now new servers are being delivered, workstations are being updated, and everyone is starting to believe in a bright future.

      <u>Act II</u> - begin the complexity.  Usually, by this time, people with a burning gaze disappear and untidy, tormented by life, who can already speak the same language with ordinary personnel, come to replace them.  It turns out that the new system is so new that you have to keep all the records anew, and enter all the initial data manually.  And this is a month or two of work, without taking into account corrections and improvements.  After entering the initial data in addition to the fact that they differ from the original by a dozen-hundred million rubles, it suddenly turns out that some operations cannot be done.  Not provided.  Or provided, but does not work.  Or it works, but not as it should.  Or it works correctly, but for this you need to change half of the existing business processes.  Implementers sigh, wrinkle turnips, call somewhere, ask for something, explain, ask, write, call back ... <br><br>  <u>Act III</u> is the beginning of the end.  There is a situation when the ‚Äútops‚Äù can no longer (wait any longer), but the ‚Äúbottoms‚Äù do not want (to suffer more).  At some point, a willful decision is made to give ends, burn bridges and start working in a new system.  The staff quietly panics, the implementers twitch and try not to contact the staff.  And here it comes true.  In the best case, the company works half-heartedly - half of the time and effort is spent on manual execution of what was usually done automatically, plus the correction of errors.  Permanent scandals.  The management scolds the staff, the staff scolds the implementers, the implementers scold the personnel and management.  Customers scold everyone. <br><br>  <u>Epilogue</u> - after a while the staff adapts, some moments are really more convenient than before, and in some cases have to suffer.  But in general, accuracy is increased, because if earlier it was easy to correct minor errors, now any little thing can stop work.  The staff is becoming very conservative and picky, some customers are freaking out because they are forced to walk along the line.  Implementers avoid all contact with the company, install only the necessary updates.  The IT department is trying to solve problems on its own, inventing crutches, scripts, shells, hacks, plugins, utilities and other tricks.  Usually it all comes down to accessing SQL DB from third-party software, with the risk of disrupting something in the system. <br><br>  <u>Curtain</u> - the bosses of enterprises in the sauna are measured by the coolness of their ERP-systems, who spent more money on them.  At this time, the operators with anguish recall the old system, where, although there was some mess, it was easy and convenient to work. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/102860/">https://habr.com/ru/post/102860/</a></p>
