  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Coworking center for freelancers with discipline support services</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  We bring to your attention the rental of unique workplaces in the business center (Moscow, TTR district) in the ‚ÄúB‚Äù class office, where, along with the usual provision of working space, you get not only ‚Äúoffice play‚Äù, but also real responsibility for their work and their obligations to customers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/060/28a/084/06028a084a8b6634768909e7dca4d886.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The idea is simple: those entrepreneurs (future employees in the center) who want to increase the motivation to perform their own work can enter into an agreement with our center.  They will work in a separate (from ‚Äúunmotivated‚Äù workers) premises in comfortable cubicles and booths, and receive, besides the usual services, some control services, which freelance workers sometimes have, are missing and which some of them lack.  Violation of a disciplinary contract by an employee will lead not only to the deduction of the ‚Äúbonus fund‚Äù that he will appoint for himself (the fund‚Äôs safety is guaranteed by a bank deposit; without violations, the employee can receive it faster in the form of a bonus or at the end of the general contract), but also ‚ÄúEvicting‚Äù an employee from a disciplinary area to another office, with no less comfort, but deprived of the control and care of the administration.

In this case, at the meetings with the customer, the administrator is present at the office personally (directly or in the ‚Äúdark room‚Äù, behind the glass) and draws conclusions about the progress of the work.  If problems of an organizational nature arise, the administrator (who is in itself a project manager with experience) informs you about ways to solve problems and informs you about the nearest planned tasks.  The administrator is interested in that you and other clients of the center conduct business successfully, since your contract with the Center is the basis of our successful business.  In fact, your success becomes necessary not only for you, but also for us, and we become one friendly team. <br><br>  3 office rental plans are offered.  They have different degrees of administrator control over the actions of the tenant. <br><br>  1. "YES" ("Discipline-absolute").  Control of attendance and the implementation of the work plan. <br><br>  2. "DB" ("Discipline-business").  Monitoring the implementation of the work plan. <br><br>  3. ‚ÄúDV‚Äù (‚ÄúVolunteer Discipline‚Äù) Relaxed control of attendance and work plan. <br><br>  To resolve possible misunderstandings, let us explain right away: a lease is not an employment contract, so no entries are made in the workbook, no salary is paid, no deductions to the pension fund, respectively.  An employee receives a salary or other means of income himself, with his work, the administration of the center helps to organize it. <br><br>  The administration has the right to move the workplace of an employee who commits a breach of obligations to the quarantine zone, which is a ‚Äúwarning zone‚Äù and additionally motivates compliance with a disciplinary agreement. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0a3/13c/8ce/0a313c8ce937a759f6cf6aa2e6e97389.jpg"><br><br>  If the employee does not fulfill his obligations, the business center terminates the contract with him in the prescribed manner.  At the same time, the employee has the right to renew the contract with our center to work in another office of our usual type, without control services (the plan of the second office is below).  Both centers contain all the necessary set of facilities and infrastructure inherent in class ‚ÄúB‚Äù offices, <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/346/2d0/eb4/3462d0eb4c069d109e600928d5bb5540.jpg"><br><br>  Most of all we are interested in the potential clientele of the first type, a promising direction with plans for control.  Therefore, we deliberately do not specify the coordinates and details of ordinary price lists in order to concentrate on the discussion and identify the needs of potential employees.  If you have already decided that this is exactly what you need, the overhead will be much less than hiring your own project manager. <br><br>  The company plans to create an office plan "DD" ("Distance discipline"), which will be implemented to monitor the distance work of the employee.  The uniqueness of this plan is that the employee does not need to rent an office, come to it, but at the same time he will remain under the strict control of the administration and will be further motivated to fulfill his obligations. <br><br>  UPD (18:00): The topic was moved from ‚ÄúStartups‚Äù to ‚ÄúIdeas for startups‚Äù.  Added tag "April 1". </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/89608/">https://habr.com/ru/post/89608/</a></p>
