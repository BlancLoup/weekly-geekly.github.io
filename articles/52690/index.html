Accordingly, this article will be of interest primarily to the male part of the population of our site and to the right girls with their hands ‚Äî from where ‚Äî need. <br><br>  <b>UPDATE!</b>  Gentlemen, this article should provide some clarity on the process of assembling a PC for beginners.  Therefore, everything in it is written in simple words, with a large number of pictures, and with an orientation to modern interfaces and standards.  Please evaluate the article objectively, and do not minus the fact that I did not describe the process of lubricating hard drives with thermal paste.  Thank :) <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  First of all, it is necessary, of course, to purchase components.  At this stage, the most difficult moment is the selection of components so that they can work together.  The secret is simple: start by choosing a processor (AMD / Intel, for ease of assembly it is better to take the BOX version, that is, with a cooler), then select the motherboard for the appropriate processor, and already for the board - compatible memory, hard disk, video card , body, etc.

      We collect a regular home computer (but we will not play on it especially), so the list of our components looks like this: <br><br>  - AMD Phenom ‚Ñ¢ Triple-Core 8450 Socket AM2 + (BOX) processor; <br>  - Gigabyte GA-M68SM-S2L Socket AM2 motherboard with integrated video adapter and AM2 + support (like on a processor); <br>  - memory 1024Mb PC2-6400 800MHz DDR2 - two pieces; <br>  - hard drive 250 Gb 7200rpm 8Mb cache Western Digital; <br>  - internal Int 3.5 "All-In-One DigiLife Black card reader; <br>  - body Velton V2023 Black, MiddleTower; <br>  - drive for NEC Sony Optiarc DVD ¬± RW discs + CD / RW. <br><br><img src="http://ahu.li/user/Image/compassemble/ah_components.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Unpack all the boxes, and gently remove the motherboard.  It can be put on the foam pad on which it lies in the package. <br>  Remove the processor from the protective plastic box.  On the motherboard, raise the metal clip next to the module to install the processor. <br><br><img src="http://ahu.li/user/Image/compassemble/p5_cpuinst1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Gently insert the processor.  Note that the triangle on the processor should be located in the corner opposite to the location of the clip-clamp.  In any case, do not confuse - the processor can be inserted only one way, it should be done very carefully and in no case should force be used. <br>  After you install the processor, the clamp must be lowered. <br>  Next, a cooler is installed - the processor cooling fan on the aluminum radiator.  It is held by two fasteners and fixed with a handle-lock.  <i>Before installing the cooler, make sure that you remove the protective plastic cover on the bottom of the cooler!</i> <br><br><img src="http://ahu.li/user/Image/compassemble/p5_cpuinst3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  After you install the cooler, you need to connect it to the motherboard.  Find the appropriate connector on it (usually marked as CPU FAN) and connect the cable to it. <br><br><img src="http://ahu.li/user/Image/compassemble/p5_cpuinst5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The processor is installed, the next step is to install the memory.  Here, too, is difficult to confuse something.  It is necessary to move the two clips on the sides and with a strong push on the plate from the top, after clicking the clips will automatically set to their original position. <br><br><img src="http://ahu.li/user/Image/compassemble/p6_memory.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Next, install the motherboard in the case.  To do this, you must first install a metal cap in the case, which comes bundled with the motherboard. <br><br><img src="http://ahu.li/user/Image/compassemble/p7_case1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Carefully install the motherboard into the case so that all the connectors fit into the plug and the screw holes on the motherboard coincide with the fasteners. <br><br><img src="http://ahu.li/user/Image/compassemble/p7_case2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Included with the case is always a bag with cogs. <br><br><img src="http://ahu.li/user/Image/compassemble/p7_case3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The cogs come in two diameters - conditionally we denote them as ‚Äúlarge‚Äù and ‚Äúsmall‚Äù.  Accordingly, everything in the case is fastened with only two types of screws.  In the following, we will talk about our particular case;  The fastener in your case may be different, and the ‚Äúspear method‚Äù will help you to understand what diameter of screws you need in each specific situation. <br>  In my case, the motherboard is fastened with ‚Äúbig‚Äù screws.  It is enough to fix the board with 4-5 screws. <br><br><img src="http://ahu.li/user/Image/compassemble/p7_case4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  We connect the main power cable to the motherboard. <br><br><img src="http://ahu.li/user/Image/compassemble/p8_power1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  We also connect an additional power cable. <br><br><img src="http://ahu.li/user/Image/compassemble/p8_power2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Now that we have installed and connected the motherboard, it is necessary to connect the hard disk, DVD and card reader.  Let's look at an example of a hard disk, how it is done. <br>  Install the hard drive bay for 3.5-inch devices and fix it with three ‚Äúbig‚Äù screws (two on one side, one on the other). <br><br><img src="http://ahu.li/user/Image/compassemble/p9_hdd2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Similarly, we install the DVD into the 5-inch bay (it may be necessary to ‚Äúbreak out‚Äù the body cap - it lends itself easily, do not be afraid to do this) - we fix it with 4 ‚Äúsmall‚Äù screws, we install the card reader into the 3.5-inch bay and fix it to 2- 3 screws. <br>  And now the most "high-tech" process - connecting the wires of the case to the motherboard.  The problem is that their connection here is very individual, and the ‚Äúpinout‚Äù for each specific motherboard can be found in the accompanying documentation on the pictures. <br>  Connect the USB located on the front of the case (on the motherboard you will find the label F_USB or USB): <br><br><img src="http://ahu.li/user/Image/compassemble/p10_usb.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Similarly, connect the audio (labeled AUDIO): <br><br><img src="http://ahu.li/user/Image/compassemble/p11_audio.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And, comparing with the book, we connect the wires of the power button (POWER_SW), reboot (RESET), the hard drive indicator (HDD_LED) and the PC power indicator (POWER_LED).  It is very important not to confuse the polarity.  Be guided by the fact that the black wire is always a ‚Äúminus‚Äù. <br><br><img src="http://ahu.li/user/Image/compassemble/p15_leds.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And finally, the last step is to connect the hard disk and DVD to the motherboard.  To do this, use two SATA POWER (power) wires and two SATA DATA (data) wires. <br>  On the example of the hard drive, the power wire connection looks like this: <br><br><img src="http://ahu.li/user/Image/compassemble/p12_satapower.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Next, connect the SATA DATA cable to the motherboard. <br><br><img src="http://ahu.li/user/Image/compassemble/p13_sata.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The other end of this wire is to a hard disk (or DVD). <br><br><img src="http://ahu.li/user/Image/compassemble/p14_satahdd.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The convenience of the SATA interface is that the order of connecting devices is irrelevant.  Moreover, you can hardly confuse something, because the cables are connected only in one way and very easily (do not use force). <br>  Now, when our computer is assembled, you need to make sure that the wires will not touch the cooler and other fans.  To do this, you can secure them with wire or rubber bands. <br><br><img src="http://ahu.li/user/Image/compassemble/p16_final.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Assembling computers on the Intel architecture differs in the process of installing the processor, but since for this architecture it is even simpler, you can do everything by analogy. <br><br>  And, of course, the author of the article does not bear any responsibility if you are there all you burn <img src="http://ahu.li/taracot/smiley/bandit.png" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/52690/">https://habr.com/ru/post/52690/</a></p>
