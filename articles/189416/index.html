And then I look around the room, and the answer suggests itself.  If you sell (well, or just don‚Äôt buy) everything that is overwhelmed with shelves and a table, you could get a very good car.  In short, below - a kind of brief operating experience of two dozen gadgets.  I really hope that this text will help you when choosing new devices and will warn you against errors. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/500/0d9/fe8/5000d9fe8d30ee60ed86f8ace259742e.jpg"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Notebook ASUS N76 <br>  (17.3 '', Full HD, Blu-ray, Core i7-3630QM, nVidia GeForce GT 635M, 8 GB, two HDDs of 2 TB in total) </h4> In general, I love Samsung laptops with all my heart, although I believe that the company is not paying too much attention to the development of this area.  If you want a very high-quality, reliable, but, to my mind, boring portable computer - then yes, Samsung.  Personally, I had three HP laptops and one Sony VAIO on my hands, and only three Samsung models managed to withstand about one and a half years of very intensive use. <br><br>  However, at the very end of 2012, when I once again decided to upgrade my laptop, I stopped at ASUS N76.  The prehistory of this purchase looks ridiculous: I went with a friend to choose a new mobile phone for her, and in the salon she seemed to point the N76 with her finger in between times - they say, look how beautiful.  I looked - and ... Well, I did not fall in love, but I remembered the model name.  I read, I thought - and decided to take.  Indeed, ASUS N76, in my opinion, today is one of the most successful options in the class ‚Äúdesktop replacement‚Äù.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7f5/3b2/4c0/7f53b24c02c592871de2994f6e6be10f.jpg"><br>  ASUS N76 in person <br><br>  I have not the most advanced modification, but ‚Äúone of‚Äù: with a Blu-ray drive and a Full HD screen with a matte finish.  Of the other amenities - the package: it includes a good cloth bag, a wired mouse and even a small subwoofer, the authorship of which is attributed to the Danes from Bang &amp; Olufsen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0a5/39b/fa3/0a539bfa3ce0d35ca5b875db3cafeb1c.jpg"><br>  The same subwoofer <br><br>  However, you will be told about the advantages and advantages in advertising leaflets, where it is more interesting to talk about the disadvantages.  In particular, the ASUS N76 has a dangling battery - so you carry a laptop in your hands, and you feel that the battery is ‚Äúwalking‚Äù in its seat.  I remember that in the case of the Sony VAIO VGN-FZ21SR, a similar constructive miscalculation led to a loss of contact between the battery and the laptop, and the latter was turned off.  ASUS N76 doesn‚Äôt have such a problem, and yet it‚Äôs a bit unpleasant ... After all, this is by no means the cheapest laptop of a Taiwanese company. <br><br>  The second complaint concerns the keyboard.  No, with ergonomics, everything is just fine with her - perhaps, in general, this is the most convenient ‚Äúkeyboard‚Äù of those that I have seen.  Thanks for the highlight too.  But the cover of the horizontal ‚Äúdrawing‚Äù on the ‚ÄúJ / O‚Äù key was wiped away after a month of operation, and now the very backlight is ‚Äúbeating‚Äù from there.  Also an unpleasant little thing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1da/63c/7b6/1da63c7b6cc129be8c3f229f77d5924d.jpg"><br>  Keyboard defect described above <br><br>  Another strange moment is from nowhere where did the scratches on the corners of the case come from.  The space around the keyboard of the ASUS N76 is metallic (the bottom is made of plastic), and so there were noticeable holes in the corners.  The laptop was never taken out of the apartment, it was not beaten or dropped.  When buying scratches exactly was not.  Mystic. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/80c/772/1d2/80c7721d21728580d0609cbc225a2ba5.jpg"><br>  Scratches on the corner of the case <br><br>  The rest is a great solution.  Especially for those who lack the MacBook in a similar configuration.  And yes, I replaced the complete mouse with a Microsoft Wireless Mobile Mouse 4000: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6bd/c31/3a6/6bdc313a6168eae6367011916be31046.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Nokia BookLet 3G Netbook </h4>  As you know, the first and the last Nokia netbook was not supplied to Russia and Ukraine.  Specifically, my copy is intended for the American operator AT &amp; T.  I don‚Äôt know, this is how it should be, or local sellers have tried it, but the 3G modem in the netbook is ‚Äúunlocked‚Äù and works great with domestic SIM cards. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8c7/453/6ed/8c74536ed35e760ef51e19e7eed4939b.jpg"><br><br>  Actually, Nokia BookLet 3G has exactly two advantages.  The first is the Nokia netbook.  I'm not sure that everyone will consider this fact an advantage, but such an origin of this computer causes an excellent WOW effect.  There was even a case when a person several times ran his hand over the cover with the Nokia logo, trying to tear off a non-existent sticker.  He thought that I took some Acer and hitched a piece of scotch with the name of a Finnish company on it. <br><br>  The second advantage is design.  Something like this would look like Apple netbook - the realm of aluminum, neat strict lines and all that.  However, Apple later released the MacBook Air 11 and showed how a small portable computer from Cupertino should look like.  It should be not only beautiful, but also powerful. <br><br>  Meanwhile, the Nokia BookLet 3G with power is all very difficult: the Intel Atom Z530 processor, designed primarily for tablets (correct, if I am mistaken), an extremely weak graphics subsystem, 1 GB of RAM, which can not be increased ... All this adds up to multi-second delays even when trying to open the Start menu in Windows 7, not to mention any MS Office file.  And the saddest thing is that I never joke. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/243/520/d9d/243520d9de156e8a1454d0808ca54393.jpg"><br>  SIM card slot <br><br>  Completing the picture is the screen resolution (by the way, muddy and low-quality), which is 1280 x 720 points against the standard for netbooks 1366 x 768 or 1024 x 600. As a result, some applications on BookLet 3G work obliquely, that is, you stretch them all over the screen - and the bottom A piece "no, it is located as if beyond the bounds of the display. <br><br>  In general, I keep this 10-inch rarity only because I <s>want to sell it in 10 years for a million dollars a</s> lot nobody will give for it today.  Well, on business trips, I sometimes travel with him anyway - let the battery hold today no longer 10 hours, as it was before, but it still provides 6-6.5 hours.  Well, thanks for that. <br><br><h4>  Kin One by Microsoft Phone </h4>  But for what years in 10 years they will give, if not a million, but several thousand for sure, so this is Kin One from Microsoft.  In the USA, he failed miserably; he did not even reach Russia at all, and even less, Russia, but I still managed to grab a copy of myself.  In terms of software, this is a kind of rudimentary version of Windows Phone without the ability to install applications, in terms of hardware, it‚Äôs a kind of bug, which is unreal to use. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f5c/99c/18c/f5c99c18cdfba94a6a7e449a5cbd5197.jpg"><br><br>  Kin One is designed for CDMA EV-DO networks, so I half-connected it with grief to Ukrainian Intertelecom.  However, after a couple of weeks the Internet was cut off, and since then Kin One can only receive and make calls.  (I wrote more about this here: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/104391/">habrahabr.ru/post/104391</a> .) <br><br><h4>  Samsung Galaxy S4 smartphone </h4>  In recent years, tried to use only Motorola smartphones, but in the end they got me.  The last straw was the fact that Motorola decided not to upgrade the Asian RAZR XT910 to Android 4.1.  That is, we will update the European, American and Australian ones as well, but the Asians will be killed.  In principle, I would be angry, angry at the ‚Äúguys from Illinois‚Äù, and would stay on the RAZR XT910 with Android 4.0.4, but here my screen cracked. <br><br>  Cracked strange: I dropped it from the sofa to the carpet (well, half a meter maximum), and everything seemed to be good.  Went to sleep.  In the morning I wake up, looking - and there is a crack through the whole screen.  Apparently, when falling, the case slightly twisted, the glass ‚Äútensed‚Äù and could not stand at night.  So I thought - to order some RAZR HD from abroad, wait for it for a couple of weeks, and then again get a bummer with fresh software and, if anything, with a repair?  (It‚Äôs no secret that now it‚Äôs not easy to repair Motorola - there are no spare parts, and the craftsmen can always pick it up properly due to lack of experience.) In the end, I went and bought Samsung Galaxy S4.  I repeatedly scolded this smartphone for a "plastic" design, so I immediately ennobled it with a yellow Flip Cover panel.  Yellow color I love significantly more than others, so this bonus brightened up a bit the suffering from a faceless design. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/406/f80/9ae/406f809aeafbd9eef6bcdbde2e350d0c.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/21f/431/4d2/21f4314d2727302e19607d79bd2a65f0.jpg"><br>  Collection of covers Samsung Galaxy S4: complete, blue Flip Cover, yellow Flip Cover <br><br>  As a gift, I was handed an extra battery with a case for recharging and another Flip Cover - blue.  Already for my hard-earned money I bought a 64-gigabyte SanDisk Mobile Ultra memory card. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4c0/4cc/d2b/4c04ccd2b8478f7e23aad5eaca0e07a7.jpg"><br>  Additional battery in the case <br><br>  In general - a good device, but so far damp.  For example, SGS4 may SUDDENLY start to heat up, although it doesn‚Äôt seem to solve any demanding tasks at this moment.  And sometimes he, on the contrary, is quite cool to himself, but when trying to take a photo with a flash, he gives out messages like: ‚ÄúNow with a flash it‚Äôs impossible, I‚Äôm hot‚Äù.  The camera application, again, regularly crashed, but this moment was fixed in one of the latest firmwares.  But now the camera sometimes starts 7-8 seconds.  And sometimes - 1-2.  In general, finish this SGS4 and finish.  This is a minus.  Well, the plus is that sooner or later it will be finished.  Unlike Motorola, Samsung does not abandon its flagship products. <br><br><h4>  HTC Titan Smartphone </h4>  There is in the collection and such.  It is difficult to say why it is necessary in the middle of 2013, but it is a pity to sell.  I don‚Äôt know if Windows Phone 7.8 will ever upgrade to any 7.9, but right now the specified OS version looks abandoned.  If some more or less interesting software for WP does appear, then only for the G8.  Here is the same Instagram for Windows Phone 7.8 is unlikely to do, but for Windows Phone 8 - may well be. <br><br>  But in terms of iron, HTC Titan is very cool.  The case is metal, the screen is awesome.  For nothing, here the resolution is only 480 x 800 with a diagonal of 4.7 inches - in the viewing angles and color reproduction this display will give odds to most ‚ÄúIPS‚Äù screens that are installed in smarts of second-tier brands. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/642/57f/203/64257f2036824b8ae6ed1b2b0fa8b93c.jpg"><br>  Kin One and HTC Titan <br><br>  But the quality of speech transmission leaves much to be desired.  In particular, the interlocutors complain of some wild rustling.  Perhaps the reason is the location of the antennas - they are located on the back panel here, and if ‚Äúthe smartphone (c) Steve Jobs is wrong to hold,‚Äù then there may be some interference and it manifests itself ... <br><br>  In general, Windows Phone looks fresh.  Here you look at SGS4 with its ‚ÄúTachwiz‚Äù, and then on Nexus 7 (about it a bit lower) with its naked Android, and it becomes somehow depressing, regardless of the difference in the OS design.  And then you look at the Windows Phone tiles - and you immediately feel more cheerful.  <s>Until you start to use, yeah.</s> <br><br><h4>  Sharp SH530U Smartphone </h4>  Type Japanese smartphone from the Japanese company Sharp, which supplies the screens of HTC, Apple and other monsters, but for some reason it equipped its own smartphone with a terrible display.  It's really scary: 5 inches, 480 x 800, the image is faded, while scrolling through the lists on the screen for a couple of seconds there are trails (!). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2c6/f82/ae9/2c6f82ae97aa7d529ae7e1664c7c69e8.jpg"><br>  Kin One and Sharp SH530U <br><br>  It's cool that there is 20 GB of memory.  If the smartphone is taken apart and the microSD card is pulled out, to which the user ‚Äúofficially‚Äù does not have access, the Sharp SH530U will have 4 GB of memory.  And if you put in the place of the extracted card its ‚Äúsister‚Äù of 32 GB, then you will get a 36 GB drive.  What I did. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a21/4f0/603/a214f0603dd5ed8acc1af60fdcef8307.jpg"><br>  Change the memory card <br><br>  And the main thing here is this: never (hear: NEVER!) Do not try to insert into the SH530U a SIM card of the microSIM format without an adapter.  With many smartphones it rolls, but here it is not.  The card is firmly stuck in the slot, and when you try to get it, the metal contacts break.  As a result, now my SH530U is no longer a double, but a single-valued smartphone, and the exact slot that supports 3G has already flown.  Sadness <br><br><h4>  Smartphone Highscreen Boost </h4>  When I did not plan on buying a Samsung Galaxy S4, but I was planning a vacation (in the end, because of the purchase of the first, the second did not take place), I also acquired Highscreen Boost. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c1f/ee1/11b/c1fee111bd1902d9de94e95463d0eabc.jpg"><br><br>  I had no sense to take the RAZR XT910 with me on the tour - it was discharged from me in a day, and if I constantly took a picture, it would take about ten hours.  The last time Smart came from Motorola about half an hour before entering Cairo, so I would like to get something more autonomous for the future.  Here Highscreen Boost is the most: with a 4,160 mAh battery, it lives with me for five days.  If you call very little, it will last up to a week.  There is, of course, RAZR MAXX XT910, but there is a battery with a capacity of 3,300 mAh, that is, noticeably weaker.  Another advantage of Boost is its quite decent 8-megapixel camera, and even with a separate key, which is not found in either the RAZR or SGS4. <br><br>  In general, the device is not bad, though not without flaws.  For example, it is thick (14 with a hook mm) and heavy (185 g).  After a thin and light RAZR, it was not easy to get used to such dimensions.  But used. <br><br><h4>  Smartphone BlackBerry Curve 9220 </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7af/2e9/84f/7af2e984fffdc8b409adc6d484668f74.jpg"><br><br>  Details about the BlackBerry Curve 9220 spoke in this post (http://habrahabr.ru/company/smartgadget/blog/186068/), but now I‚Äôll just add that there was no place for it in my personal ecosystem.  Well, yes, the dialer.  Yes, small and compact.  Looks fresh again.  But for the role of dialers, I have several other devices ... <br><br><h4>  Nokia 105 and Samsung Keystone 2 Phones </h4><br>  Such a handset with a weekly autonomy (against a couple of days in the case of the BlackBerry Curve 9220) and a minimum of functions, I think, should be bundled with any modern smartphone (except perhaps Highscreen Boost). <br><br>  Smartphones on Android - they work strangely: the Samsung Galaxy S4 seems to demonstrate 40% of the battery charge, and after a couple of hours, although I didn‚Äôt play, I didn‚Äôt watch the video and the Internet didn‚Äôt surf, I‚Äôm already offering to connect the charger.  I have an extra battery (see above), but in general it is not included in the SGS4 package - I was handed it to the store as a bonus.  And other SGS4 owners do not have it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/045/854/524/0458545241db7b6c464e07563f7c4f50.jpg"><br>  Nokia 105 and Samsung Keystone 2 <br><br>  Now Nokia 105 and Samsung Keystone 2 are not particularly needed.  But to describe the life of the situation on the market, these devices are very well suited.  Yes, in "Korean" there is no FM radio and a normal flashlight (there is only the Flashlight application, which displays a white picture), that is, seemingly mandatory options for budget handsets.  But otherwise, this product is noticeably steeper than the ‚ÄúFinn‚Äù: this also applies to the quality of the screen (it is literally taller than the head), and the materials of the case (Samsung doesn‚Äôt scratch or get dirty), and the quality of voice transmission and warranty (for Samsung normal, and Nokia - a kind, see the article in the "Statements": <a href="http://tinyurl.com/oublbng">tinyurl.com/oublbng</a> ).  At the same time, both phones cost 800 rubles.  So draw conclusions - who is heading for what, and who is heading for success ... <br><br><h4>  Other phones </h4>  I don‚Äôt want to describe the old stuff in detail, so I‚Äôll just say that there is a small secret shop in our ‚ÄúCity N‚Äù.  On the shelves there stands an almost complete line of new (!) Siemens phones, some equally new Nokia smartphones, including the 6600 and 7610, a number of Motorola models from the time of the C350, and so on.  All phones have never been in use - they are in films and in the complete set.  (But they are not included, since the batteries came as far back as the last five-year plan.) For a long time tormented the sellers - say, where did all this come from?  <s>"Echo of War" - they replied.</s>  Achieve a clear answer failed.  Apparently, these are some stocks of goods or telephones from service centers (they have devices for spare parts), which have not been able to sell for many, many years.  So I bought Siemens SX1, Sony Ericsson W880i and a couple of other devices there.  If anyone is interested - write letters, I will give an address :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6db/b3e/369/6dbb3e3693a2adb556f27376194548d7.jpg"><br>  Motorola E770v, Siemens SX1, Sony Ericsson W880, Motorola RAZR V3 <br><br><h4>  The New iPad Tablet </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/60c/494/b97/60c494b97b1b042e27a4000c00a2416e.jpg"><br><br>  The simplest version is no cellular connection, 16 GB of memory, black.  I remember, I was very surprised by the display, but today, at the time of smartphones with Full HD screens, it is no longer so amazing.  But still good.  You can‚Äôt say much about IPAD - reliable, fast and all that.  But perhaps it‚Äôs too big: it was after ‚Äútalking‚Äù with The New iPad that I realized that the tablets in the ‚Äú9.7-10.1 inch‚Äù form factor are too big and heavy for me. <br><br><h4>  Nexus 7 Tablet </h4>  I bought this tablet for the sole purpose - to quickly get the latest versions of Android and study the changes.  Therefore, it was decided not to spend money on the version with 16 GB of memory (the 32-gigabyte version did not yet exist) and buy a modification of 8 GB.  As a result, I will not recommend it to anyone - only about 6 ‚Äúhectares‚Äù are available, which is extremely small for a normal life.  Now the secondary market "Nexus" is very large, so there is a temptation to buy an option with 8 GB for "peels of cocks".  So: do not regret money - the more memory the better.  To expand it is impossible. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d59/ab3/b5b/d59ab3b5ba7a475c8feb2affdfac4823.jpg"><br><br>  In general, the Nexus 7 is a great tablet.  And cheap.  Look after him at all kinds of semi-finished products with dull ‚ÄúRockchips‚Äù, ‚ÄúBoxchips‚Äù, without GPS-modules, but with a case in the kit (this is YES!), I don‚Äôt feel like it. <br><br>  But without quibbles will not do this time.  The first and foremost is the weird screen behavior.  In the upper left corner on a black background dozens of luminous dots are sometimes visible.  They look like broken pixels, but when you press a finger, their number and location change.  After a reboot, they may disappear for a while, or they may remain in place. <br><br>  The second point is the silver edging of the case, which is trying to look like metal, but in reality it is plastic, and moreover soft.  In my case, a noticeable dent appeared on it, although I use the tablet very carefully. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/700/204/bf8/700204bf82a0510aeadc5683129cac0c.jpg"><br>  That same dent <br><br>  In general, I use Nexus 7 primarily to play Angry Birds.  Well, I‚Äôm following the Android updates, of course: the next version of the operating system just arrived - the other day. <br><br><h4>  Reader Highscreen Alex </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/821/19e/fb3/82119efb3f3b2d9718a26f9f2215eb3c.jpg"><br><br>  One of my favorite devices.  "Technology for the sake of technology" - just some kind of decadence.  Here, I will remind you, there are two screens: the upper 6-inch E Ink, the lower one - a 3.5-inch capacitive TFT-matrix.  And here is the operating system Android 1.6, Wi-Fi adapter and other inclinations of a tablet computer.  You can use ‚ÄúAlex‚Äù as a reader without any problems, it is difficult to use it as an Android device in the usual sense of the word - the OS version is very old, the screen has a horizontal orientation, there is no Google Play catalog. <br><br><h4>  Reader PocketBook Basic </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8b9/223/6e0/8b92236e02d94643965eb27508de0299.jpg"><br><br>  All good Alex in the role of the reader, but only longish.  Therefore, it does not fit in a small bag, and the battery for a couple of years of operation began to keep less ... That's why I took the PocketBook Basic.  I know that Sony does a good reading room, and Amazon tears up everyone and everything, but I still prefer ‚Äúomnivorous.‚Äù  In general, Basic is a very decent model, it does not have any serious drawbacks, it is relatively inexpensive.  From the unpleasant I will single out a slightly creaky body and the absence of a music player - sometimes I don‚Äôt mind reading the music. <br><br><h4>  Canon EOS 1000D Camera </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a9b/a4f/003/a9ba4f003b891609ae416d711d7d8be7.jpg"><br><br>  It was bought in a drunken stupor under the cheerful cries of the second half - they say, well, let's try to become professional photographers!  I knew perfectly well that I wouldn‚Äôt become a professional photographer, and even becoming one with the Canon EOS 1000D, and even with a whale lens, is simply unrealistic, so ... In short, I got off with a little blood - I took the most inexpensive DSLR, tried to take a picture, did not like it, put it on the shelf.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Well, half, which is the second - so she lost interest in photographing about a day after the purchase. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Women are such.</font></font><br><br><h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Nikon CoolPix S800c Camera </font></font></h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d7a/c38/cb8/d7ac38cb86debd278ae859c7cabcbfec.jpg"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I told about it in this post: </font></font><a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/smartgadget/blog/182214/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">habrahabr.ru/company/smartgadget/blog/182214</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Gizmo in the style of Highscreen Alex: everything seems to be cool, but difficult to use. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Yes, in theory, the camera running Android is very convenient and functional, but if you want both steps and go, look towards the Samsung Galaxy Camera. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">S800c is completely bad.</font></font><br><br><h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Kodak EasyShare C123 Sport Camera </font></font></h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bd3/06c/29f/bd306c29f2b077d475b6bda95c0f76a2.jpg"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">My favorite camera - in normal conditions it removes lousy, but yellow and ... underwater. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And just for hunting for fish and sea urchins, it fits well. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Yes, there is no optical zoom, yes, the video records in a resolution of 640 x 480, which is damn little. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But it cost about $ 70 in 2011. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And for this money, there was practically no alternative to this Kodak. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Now on the Internet, the EasyShare C123 Sport is found somewhere else, but for some reason they ask for it up to 200 bucks. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I do not recommend to pay so much, more sophisticated mass options.</font></font><br><br><h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Sony Walkman NWZ-S763 Player </font></font></h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I am by no means an audiophile, so I will not talk about expensive players from proud little-known brands and headphones for a thousand bucks. I listen to music on the Sony Walkman NWZ-S763 with 4 GB of memory - it so happened that I did not find the 8-gigabyte version on sale. To say something special about it is impossible: it plays worse than those of the most expensive players, but it is clearly better than the products offered under local Russian trademarks.</font></font><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/120/c64/a03/120c64a033167f077d9f6e5521a6a60f.jpg"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Sony believed in the prospects of Bluetooth technology and even implemented it in such a way that now you can not only plug in headphones, but also ‚Äúthrow‚Äù files. It's good. And the bad thing is that to connect to a computer using a proprietary WM-port. This means that if you sow the cable, you will have to pay. Pay, however, also does not always work out - such "shoelaces" are rarely available. </font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/14c/6fb/be7/14c6fbbe7d4390c0601b4da3408f6afc.jpg"><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The unfortunate WM-port </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And the body here, by the way, is metal. And he, as Internet observers say, "pleasantly cools the hand."</font></font> Here it is. <br><br><h4>  Behind the scenes </h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There are also a number of other devices on the farm, which for various reasons do not want to talk more or less in detail. However, I think they deserve a short mention. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Here, for example, Acer AspireRevo nettop on the first version of nVidia Ion. I bought it in an attempt to transfer from a laptop to a desktop with a good monitor, but a month later I realized that laptops are forever. </font></font><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2d4/f71/a57/2d4f71a57a69c9063c06c9bd49b02a03.jpg"><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The computer is like this: Acer AspireRevo nettop, LG W2600HP monitor, Microsoft Wireless Laser Desktop 6000 kit </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is a Motorola digital photo frame. I doubt very much that the American company itself riveted this framework - apparently, it bought it on the side and drew its logo. In general, I bought this thing for a gift, but then at home I once again appreciated the depressing quality of the screen and decided to keep it - it was a shame to give it.</font></font><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ef8/c25/1e3/ef8c251e3d2e6e1fc4190c7aee3d27d0.jpg"><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Digital Frame Motorola LS700 </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Stand Microsoft Cooling Base for laptops with a diagonal of 15 inches. He copes with his tasks, but he buzzes very unpleasantly at work. Sometimes I use it in the summer, although the 17-inch ASUS N76 staggers on it. </font></font><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/88d/7c1/06c/88d7c106c8db533962c1ccac16d32f1a.jpg"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Bluetooth headset Motorola Finiti. If I understand correctly, it reads vibrations from the skull, has several microphones, and it also comes with a tricky Android application that provides SMS playback in English. In general, a good headset, but only I did not learn to carry something extra on my head. </font></font><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4d2/fc2/037/4d2fc2037d77621857d548726d177809.jpg"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Xbox 360. Wanted to play sports, playing sports games with Kinect support. Enough for exactly three days, after which a gym membership was purchased. So somehow safer.</font></font><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c5b/a35/073/c5ba350737289b46a66911623d5be0f0.jpg"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">That's all (almost all). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Hello to all those who read :)</font></font></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/189416/">https://habr.com/ru/post/189416/</a></p>
