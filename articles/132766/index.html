  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Do I need to be a programmer to embody the concept?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Talent and even genius, of course, is accompanied only by diligence.  However, there are people who are not due to the lack of it, but because of their mental attitude, they remain forever amateurs in the business to which they are drawn all their lives.  It seems to me that such people were all science-fiction writers (I mean science fiction);  they are journalists who have dedicated themselves to a specific subject: sports, music, and cinema;  also, for example, coaches and producers.  And it‚Äôs true that a good music critic is just another failed musician.  The reverse, of course, is not equally true, but this is not about that now. <br><br>  I'm getting this far. <a name="habracut"></a>  A lot has always connected me with the IT sphere.  At least the fact that I had a computer at the age of 7, and at the age of 8 I already wrote Basic programs.  However, such a ‚Äúchild prodigy‚Äù in the end did not give the obvious result at that moment, namely, I did not become a programmer.  My math closed my way there, which, by virtue of its extreme abstractness, absolutely did not interest me.  As a result, I didn‚Äôt get my cherished XXX points on entrance examinations to universities.  For some time I was engaged in programming what is called ‚Äúfor myself‚Äù, but with the start of work as a civil engineer on the 3rd course, I finally abandoned the code. <br><br>  However, all my ideas that arise regarding the creation of concepts for various programs remained with me.  All my further work as an engineer was accompanied by a myriad of small insights, as one could automate this or that tedious repetitive design process.  Indeed, despite the abundance of various CAD systems (and ‚Äúadd-ons‚Äù for CAD systems), the designer continues to perform most actions even in these programs with unenviable periodicity: due to the lack of funds intended for this, but also because of ignorance or the ‚Äúunfriendly‚Äù interface of the program hindering the rational use of all means.  Then I implemented some of my ideas about automation, but, rather, for my own convenience.

      A year has passed since then.  I do not design anymore.  But ideas continue to come to me, and now these are not applied ‚Äúimprovers‚Äù, but ideas of Internet services. <br><br>  It must be said that the rapid development of interactive Internet capabilities (full-fledged applications in the browser), an increase in the width of communication channels and the spread of wireless Internet (3G, Wi-Max, etc.) open up vast expanses for creating large-scale and commercially profitable projects time have become, for example, YouTube or all the scathing Facebook. <br><br>  In this regard, I especially don‚Äôt understand the prevalence of similar projects that prevail in runet, which are cloned from one another.  And even more it is not clear the abundance of useless startups, which are most often attractive to the user "for the first 15 minutes."  <b>Creating a concept of a product that would become part of the user's life is, I think, the main thing on which the start-up efforts should be focused.</b>  Unfortunately, among startups, I see the overwhelming majority of programmers who are concerned about the technical side of the project, but who practically don‚Äôt care about its conceptual and somewhat aesthetic side. <br><br>  Of course, you can say that there are designers for aesthetics.  However, a good half of the aesthetic side lies precisely in the concept.  This can be understood, for example, by analyzing popular Apple products.  A bunch of design and concept in them is virtually indestructible. <br><br>  But back to my question.  Although the above paragraphs of this text can be traced mentor tone with respect to startups, in fact, I'm not here to criticize and denounce.  I am now in turmoil and need advice. <br><br>  Lately, probably half of the programmers have somehow unnoticed become startups.  But, in your opinion, can a person who has no education in the IT field, have lost a few programming skills, but has a logical thinking and what is called a million dollars?  And is it possible to really embody the created and thought-out concept, without having the ability and desire to create the code yourself, to go into the technical details of the implementation (especially considering that an entire team of professionals is needed for implementation)? <br><br>  Tell us whether there are successful projects on the Internet in which there is a ‚Äúdivision of labor‚Äù initially, as, for example, in music like: ‚Äúthe sound producer creates the concept and sound of the group;  the author writes lyrics and music;  is the music band just responsible for the technical implementation? ‚Äù <br><br>  How can you minimize the chance of being left behind by those who implemented the idea? <br><br>  Thanks in advance for your attention, your answers and tips! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/132766/">https://habr.com/ru/post/132766/</a></p>
