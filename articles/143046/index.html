Yes, it happened!  We got out of the bushes, basements and server rooms, and tried to get to know each other.  It was originally planned that the event will be held at <a href="http://hit.ac.il/web/eng/default.asp">Holon Institute of Technology</a> , but in the process of organizing it was decided to transfer the meeting to the Co-Working <a href="http://www.techloft.co.il/">TECHLOFT</a> office in the heart of Tel Aviv.  People began to catch up to 19:00.  Since the majority saw each other for the first time, before conducting the reports, half an hour was allocated for dating and networking. <br><br>  Despite the fact that about 50 users said about their desire to participate in the event at Habr√©, more than 100 people gathered at the meeting.  The guests were kindly provided with ‚Äúpryziki‚Äù and drinks, but less than 20 minutes later, as a very generous reader of Habr - Cyril ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/shtonibudtakoe/" class="user_link">shtonibudtakoe</a> ) who was not greedy at all, decided to treat everyone who came with beer and other alcoholic beverages.  <s>By the way, despite his generosity, Cyril still cannot write on Habr√©, so if one of you has a free invite and wants to thank him, then do a good deed - give an invite to a person.</s> <br><br>  The general theme of the meeting was the creation of start-ups.  In total, four reports were held: <br>  1. <a href="http://il.linkedin.com/in/davidpaluy">David Paluy</a> aka <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/dpaluy/" class="user_link">dpaluy</a> , shared information on how to win the attention of business angels and VC.  What you need to have time to do in 2 minutes of the meeting, which are given to budding entrepreneurs.  How can you prepare for this more thoroughly and who can help with this?  The presentation of the author can be found <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/davidpaluy/howto-prepare-fund-raising-presentation">here</a> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  2. <a href="http://il.linkedin.com/in/dudipeles">Dudi Peles</a> gave a great talk on ‚ÄúGamification - The Power of Gameful Design‚Äù.  Of course, this was the most interesting session on the topic gaining momentum.  Doody talked about how using gamification you can turn boring and tedious processes into an entertaining and fun activity.  Cited as an example the cases of Waze, Forsquare and BMW.  He presented his own cases to the public and showed how in a short time in one of the special schools he turned a boring programming course into one of the favorite subjects among students.

      3. <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/mikich">Mikhail Chernyavsky</a> aka <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/mikich/" class="user_link">mikich</a> , spoke about the AT &amp; T Foundry and the support of novice start-up teams with professional teams of specialists from companies such as AT &amp; T, Amdocs, Ericsson.  AT &amp; T Innovation in Israel <br><br>  4. In the last report, <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/zaidelson">Alexander Zaydelson</a> aka <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/azaidelson/" class="user_link">azaidelson</a> , raised the topic of support and development of local startups from the Skolkovo project.  It was said about the conditions under which Israeli start-ups can receive grants from the booming Russian HighTech greenhouses.  Details can be found in his <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/alexanderzaidelson/startup-nation-2012-skolkovo">presentation</a> or on the official website of <a href="http://www.israelsk.com/">Israel-SK</a> . <br><br>  A small surprise was that all the speakers conducted sessions in Hebrew, and not in Russian, as most expected.  But according to my feelings, the majority did not stop. <br><br>  At the meeting, comrades with professional cameras were noticed.  I'd love to look at photos from yesterday's meeting.  Please share links in the comments.  In the meantime, a few photos from my soap dish. <br><br>  We can say that the meeting was a success.  Let not everyone liked the topics and not everyone had time to talk, the main thing is that a start has been made.  Habravchane looked at each other, realized that most of us are adequate people, we found common topics for conversation.  And each time it will be better and better. <br><br>  Thanks to Baruh Yohai aka <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/dvaruh/" class="user_link">dvaruh</a> who organized such an event and brought it to realization.  Thanks to all the speakers for interesting topics!  Thanks to the guys who helped organize the meeting - Victor <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/torai/" class="user_link">torai</a> , who helped organize the projector, Mikhail Vinogradov <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/mamyta/" class="user_link">mamyta</a> for the design of the event logo.  Special thanks to Xenia, who spent the entire evening in an embrace with a camera, trying to capture the event itself and all of us, as well as her <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/zlozzy/" class="user_link">zlozzy</a> husband, who dragged her to us for a meeting.  :) Thanks to Gilad Tufias, the faunder and the managing director of TECHLOFT, who agreed to shelter us.  In general, the place turned out to be very interesting and enjoyable.  I would like to see such CoWorking-offices not only in Tel Aviv. <br><br><h2>  Photos from the meeting </h2><br>  Opening of the meeting and opening speech <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/dvaruh/" class="user_link">dvaruh</a> .  His brain has long been eaten by a cerebral slug. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4be/f1f/61e/4bef1f61e91a8999eed91af4a07a1b8a.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/494/758/157/494758157dc9753a092c2c9d2b0df655.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d13/a86/5d2/d13a865d22456fb01b4b6c2a862a9b26.jpg"><br><br>  The cozy Techloft building that sheltered us. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f4b/877/946/f4b877946613313a749827fbacf207d1.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8d7/484/c70/8d7484c70dbe5a5d74044a3670530a9e.jpg"><br><br>  David Paluy lights and sets the tone for habrewstreams. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a29/2f4/2f1/a292f42f1077e43f3f7e081687c20d07.jpg"><br><br>  Habrayusers attentively listen to what they are trying to convey to Dudi Peles about gamification. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/914/3d7/c6d/9143d7c6deafd9e3922c124c6cdcc7c5.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dd2/74e/60b/dd274e60b4e559da42423c997ac299b9.jpg"><br><br>  Mikhail Chernyavsky talks about Crocs competitors, who are carved by Indian children from used tires.  )) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/39f/310/7c9/39f3107c94a8d1ffe31797748c216852.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3e8/1ab/30d/3e81ab30d3a025b29e124ca874621e55.jpg"><br><br>  Alexander Seidelson talks about the areas in which Skolkovo works. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/692/40f/e45/69240fe4583815fb632eed45a00adab0.jpg"><br><br>  PS So that next time it would be easier to decide on the subject of the reports, I suggest accepting the proposal received from <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/cybertor/" class="user_link">CyberTor</a> and conducting a small survey on the subject of which of us works and in what direction it works.
