  <section class="page js-page"><h1>I am a genius, or how to learn a foreign language.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The son of my acquaintance, who had left for Italy for a vacation with his grandmother, arrived the other day, and came to visit my son.  I immediately pounced on him with questions about how he was in a foreign country and whether he managed to master the language during the time spent there.  I was terribly interested in his story in the light of my <a title="Methods of learning and teaching foreign languages" href="http://filolingvia.com/publ/">research into the methods, techniques, methods and secrets of studying and teaching foreign languages</a> , since his method was completely unique! <br>  I knew him from childhood, he is the same age and friend of my son, and I remember that while he lived here, at school he studied rather mediocre and was not distinguished by any particular diligence or discipline.  What was my surprise when he said that he speaks Italian fluently and has absolutely no problems with communication in a foreign country, although he lived there for less than a year.  And to the question of how he managed to learn a language so quickly and simply, he told an amazing story. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  It turns out that no one taught him specifically and did not study individually, he was simply sent to study ... to a school for Italian mentally retarded peers!  Those.  This is a school in which for 10 years they have been giving an elementary school course - reading, writing, simple mathematics, chewing everything in detail and repeating and repeating it many times.  And all these children were fluent in the language! <br>  ‚ÄúBeing among them,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúI felt almost genius.  I quickly understood the teacher's explanations, even though they were in a foreign language, I could instantly solve any example or problem.  And they behaved quite childishly, played with toys, could not concentrate and at least remember something.  And in such a moral state not to understand the language turned out to be simply impossible, everything was assimilated easily and simply, and the teachers and students explained everything very kindly and repeated.  They spoke simple language, without any abstruse phrases, and it was all quickly remembered and learned without additional effort. " <br>  He did not cram words, grammar was given only in the volume of primary classes, but this seemingly non-intensive approach gave the result much better than intensive courses! <br>  This unusual case once again confirms that all problems with the study of languages ‚Äã‚Äãare mainly psychological in nature and are caused by incorrect teaching methods and poor teachers working out a complex of language deficiencies and aversion to the subject being studied from their students. <br>  There are very few physiologically incapable people, they are engaged in medicine, and all other people simply inspired themselves with this inability and can get rid of it.  Everybody can learn a foreign language; you just need to abandon outdated and not working approaches and methods and <a title="Motivation to learn foreign languages" href="http://filolingvia.com/publ/50-1">find your own way to the language</a> ! <br>  Road going by walking! </div>
