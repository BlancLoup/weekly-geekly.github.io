  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The potential of the subscription base for the Internet entrepreneur and common mistakes when working to increase the subscription base</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Most Internet entrepreneurs, both beginners and active ones, face some problem - this is a small number of subscribers.  There are, of course, a number of reasons for this.  There are typical mistakes that make this situation happen.  We will talk about them later. <br><br>  Why do we need subscribers?  The most frequent problem is the lack of understanding of the importance of this moment, i.e.  usually how it happens: we make a website, we make an online store, we do something, <a name="habracut"></a>  and it becomes more interesting for us to work with some technical part of our resource, because this is new, a person is so arranged that he is interested in everything new, and this immediately brings results.  Technically, you can immediately make a website, the result is immediately, and it is very simple.  So, we have some wrong outlook formed in our minds, that we are doing something, we are constantly working on something, we don‚Äôt have time, but the result, namely the specific result for money, by subscribers remains unsatisfactory.  Why?  Because we spend most of our time not on that: we continue to delve into technical details, we are doing what we are interested in, and not what brings results.  And the result brings specific subscribers.  And we simply do not really deal with them, i.e.  we do not study this topic, we do not analyze why subscribers come, where they subscribe better, etc.  etc.  That is, we are not doing this closely.  In fact, in principle, this is not a terrible indicator, because it‚Äôs quite normal when you just start your business you have so many tasks, so many problems, so much attention goes to outsiders, that it‚Äôs very difficult to distinguish between activities and choose something really important and necessary. <br><br>  But let's go back to the subscribers.  Subscribers in any business that is associated with the Internet - this is important, and it definitely needs time, it needs to be engaged.  Why do you need to do this?  Because <b>subscribers are returning traffic</b> .  Returning traffic to your online stores, traffic to your sites, traffic to your infobusiness.  Whatever you do this traffic is returning, and this traffic is the easiest, because it is much more difficult to attract a new visitor to the site than to attract an old one.  You need to find a new visitor, you need to be interested, and the visitor that you already have in the subscription is used to you, he loves you, and he returns with pleasure, and, of course, this is reflected in many things related to your business. , and above all on the money.

      <br>
      Here is a screenshot that displays a real picture of what is happening.  For example, the Yandex advertising network and earnings on one of the sites. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/300/d7b/21e/300d7b21e7c60ff9427f3392311974ce.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  We see from the screenshot that the average daily wage is 200 rubles per day.  But there is a sharp jump, a peak, when earnings have become 4 times more, i.e.  became 800 rubles a day.  What happened?  At this point, the newsletter was released.  Released and earnings increased sharply.  And if you are the owner of your site, then every time you have a newsletter with an interesting, intriguing topic with your new article and subscribers will actively come to the site, you will have this picture.  Accordingly, the more often the delivery will be sent out, the more often such explosions will be - attendance explosions and yield explosions.  The larger the list, the greater the return.  This is real money that you can really touch, put in your pocket, buy something on it, i.e.  This is not a joke, this is money.  <b>Subscribers = money</b> .  A loyal audience is your subscribers too. <br><br>  Many have been struggling for years to ensure that your site was active, that there were comments and discussions on it, that the site looked alive, and that there were constantly traffic on it. <br>  It is very sad to go to your website or online store, or somewhere else where there is no movement, where you can see that there are no people, no one leaves their traces.  And it is very difficult to get from constant traffic, traffic that comes to your website from search engines of any kind of movement or any kind of activity. <br><br>  On the site of my colleague, very often there are surprised comments containing something like this: ‚ÄúYour site has so many comments per day, with such attendance it is impossible, where do you buy comments?‚Äù <br>  Many people really do not understand why activity and active commenting depend - it depends specifically on subscribers.  People coming from the side, read your website, watch your online store and go past.  They do not have the time, desire or motivation to leave their mark, comment on something, or make some kind of movement.  But if you have subscribers, if you have a lot of them, then there will be a lot of comments. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cad/c39/0c8/cadc390c8e5aedbb4c65b0c5cc8fec5e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Look at the screenshot made from the admin site of my colleague.  Total 98 entries, with more than 20,000 comments.  Not bad?  - Not bad.  It would be impossible to get such a result if it were not for the subscribers.  It is the subscribers, the loyal audience that creates activity and comments.  The more activity, the more comments, the higher your ratings, the higher you are in the search engines, the more pleasant your site is and it shows that it lives, and accordingly other visitors also become infected with it. <br><br>  It is also possible with the help of subscribers to finally realize their dream, their secret desires to make money on affiliate programs.  I do not know a person who would not like to make money on affiliate programs, because it‚Äôs so great, gave a link to someone else‚Äôs product and received money.  You do not do anything, you do not produce anything, you just get affiliate commissions - the dream of any Internet entrepreneur.  But this dream is usually very far away.  Why?  Because, in order to work with affiliate programs successfully, you need to learn this, you need to have knowledge, you need to be able to do a lot.  In principle, this is not a problem, but this problem becomes not a problem at all when you have a subscription base and the subscription base is quite large.  Then you can sometimes afford to promote affiliate programs in this database.  Of course, it is often not worthwhile to promote, because they are real people, who don‚Äôt really like what you are constantly trying to earn.  But if you use the affiliate program to submit high-quality information, and do it reasonably and moderately, then subscribers will only be grateful to you, and you will receive certain commissions for it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/810/078/f03/810078f031dae20c4221e2eae8efe7ec.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Here is a screenshot from an affiliate program made personally by my colleague, for today - almost 370,000 rubles were earned on the affiliate program using a subscription list, using one of the affiliate programs, using one of the mailings.  And if you want your earnings to become the same, and revenues were measured in hundreds of thousands of rubles, then without a subscription base this will be hard enough.  And you need to start working with the subscription base right now, and set aside time and energy to work effectively with this asset. <br>  You can also sell ads on ezines, look at a typical example. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9a2/1f1/d0c/9a21f1d0cd6d5eb6e59544d23618102d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  A home business site sells advertisements in an ezine that costs a certain amount of money.  I have been following this site for a long time, looking at how ads are being sold there.  You know, it is sold monthly, and in every issue advertising is sold.  The extra $ 500 this site always earns with the help of subscribers.  But this is a rather modest result, since  I know people who earn more than $ 2,000 in advertising on the list.  It is clear that without the subscription base this money would not exist. <br><br>  In addition, with the help of subscribers, you can create yourself another source of income.  If you look at the previous site, everything is done very simply - the newsletter is made, and it includes 100 business ideas.  100 business ideas can be found everywhere, and they are described to put it mildly anyhow, just taken from the site.  100 business ideas are included in the automatic mailing for several years to come.  And between these issues is inserted advertising, that's all, that's the whole business as they say, but money is alive. <br><br>  You can also create other types of businesses using the subscription base, such as infobusiness, businesses selling some goods, services, etc., etc.  If you have a customer base on any subject, then you can earn a net profit from it.  Who has customers, he makes more money. <br>  Everyone knows that manufacturers earn much less than those who are already sellers of these products.  And if you have a customer base in your hands, then you will have everything in your hands.  With this you can achieve quite serious and lofty goals. <br><br>  Therefore, subscribers are needed, and without it you can not go anywhere.  Statistics also proves that any successful Internet entrepreneur has a base of 5,000 subscribers, whether subscribers from feedburner, smartresponder, twitter or any other services. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/775/ed4/219/775ed4219b6c8865bd886352eee6323f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/04b/8ad/5aa/04b8ad5aa446d3b3d4e568d875a5297b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Here I brought screenshots of fairly well-known bloggers who make quite good money from their sites, and they have 5000 to 10,000 subscribers in feedburner.  And you need to look at it, it‚Äôs not just their subscribers, it‚Äôs not just that they earn money, and it‚Äôs not just that they have a few thousand people a day.  Naturally attendance depends on the assets that they have in the subscription base.  Therefore, without this in any way.  If you are going to build a profitable online business, then you need to strengthen in this direction, plan a day or a part of the day and be sure to work on it. <br><br><h5>  Common mistakes when working with subscription base </h5><br><ul><li>  Lack of regular action </li></ul><br>  When there is no regular action, then there is no result.  In general, you need to understand that any result is a regular action.  You can not achieve a good result for a long time with the help of some chaotic actions. <br><ul><li>  Lack of clear strategy </li></ul><br>  This is also one big minus.  It is clear that you need to work with the subscription base, it is clear that you need it as much as possible, it is clear that you need to do some actions every day to create it.  But how to do it?  How to do it when there is so much information around, so much for which it is not clear to grab, the head is torn, i.e.  no clear strategy.  The strategy should be clear, defined, step by step, what exactly to do to get the result.  If you don‚Äôt have this strategy, you don‚Äôt know what to do today, what to do tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, but just start grabbing at everything - try it, try something, don‚Äôt analyze what is happening, then of course all this will turn into chaos, and chaos does not work. <br><ul><li>  Flaw (there are visitors, no subscribers) </li></ul><br>  The error is very common, there are visitors, many have visitors, and there are plenty of them, but there is no result, there are no subscribers.  1000 visitors on the site - in the subscription base of 10 people.  As is familiar, this happens very often.  That is, people come, but they are not being finalized, they are not working with them to the end.  You need to work with them, you need to analyze, you need to look, you need to think, you need to use some chips and constantly think through a few steps forward. <br><ul><li>  Insufficient attention to active ways to get visitors </li></ul><br>  This also leads to a deplorable result.  There is traffic from seo, i.e.  search traffic, it is quite stable at a certain rhythm of work, and when you take off at a certain level.  But there is active traffic, many people underestimate it and do not work with it, so there are few visitors, respectively, there are also few subscribers.  This problem also needs to be removed. <br><ul><li>  Insufficient understanding of the importance and potential of the subscription base </li></ul><br><ul><li>  Lack of analysis of what is happening </li></ul><br>  You need to analyze what is happening with your subscription base, what is happening with your visitors who come to the site and should seem to be subscribers, but do not become.  The analysis should be.  It needs to be analyzed, but this is often not done. <br><br>  These are the 6 common mistakes that are most common, and I would recommend that you just mark with a pencil or pen somewhere that needs to be corrected, that you need to find a clear strategy, make sure that actions are regular, pay attention to what you are previously did not pay attention, etc.  etc. <br><br>  To be continued‚Ä¶ </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/137685/">https://habr.com/ru/post/137685/</a></p>
