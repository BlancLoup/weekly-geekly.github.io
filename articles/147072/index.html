      At the <a href="http://event.gigaom.com/structure/%3Futm_source%3Dcloud%26utm_medium%3Deditorial%26utm_campaign%3Dintext%26utm_term%3D535130%2Bif-aws-is-the-walmart-of-cloud-is-openstack-the-soviet-union%26utm_content%3Dkfitchard">GigaOM Structure</a> conference at the San Francisko Thursday, everything was ready for a lively debate between the representatives of <a href="http://www.citrix.ru/">Citrix</a> , <a href="http://www.eucalyptus.com/">Eucalyptus</a> and <a href="http://openstack.org/">OpenStack</a> , the strongest players in the world of cloud technologies.  Suddenly, Chris Kemp, CEO of <a href="http://www.nebula.com/">Nebula</a> and co-founder of OpenStack, barely had time to enter, already crammed his colleagues by comparing the API provided by <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services</a> with the Walmart infrastructure. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fairly fast and fairly secure,‚Äù Kemp says of the AWS API, ‚Äúand therefore it has the lion‚Äôs share of the cloud market.  But AWS will never be super-fast and completely inaccessible.  Yes, perhaps Amazon managed to achieve universal acceptance, but their API still remains privately owned.  And anyway, who said that universal acceptance means something? ‚Äù <br><br>  Kemp has criticized Citrix and Eucalyptus for strengthening Amazon‚Äôs dominance instead of using and maintaining OpenStack.  But Eucalyptus Systems CEO Marten Mickos (Marten Mickos) and Samir Dolakia (Sameer Dholakia), head of the Citrix Systems Cloud Platform Group, of course, did not agree with Kemp's arguments or platform charges. <br><br>  Both noted that their platforms, like OpenStack, are open-source.  But the raging Kemp refused to accept this definition, citing his protest by saying that ‚Äúif the core of the platform is developed within the company, and then it is laid out in free access, then it‚Äôs not open-source‚Äù.  As an example, true open-source Kemp cited OpenStack (who would have thought?), Which, unlike all the others, was fully developed by a wide range of participants. <br><br>  Dolakia objected, saying that developing a core code together with a group of talented engineers, and then putting it into free access is an ideal solution, as a reliable foundation laid by professionals gives everyone a great opportunity to build something of their own.  By the way, OpenStack has not yet recovered from the previous blow struck by Citrix, when the latter abandoned the former and developed for the <a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/">Apache Foundation Group the</a> new software <a href="http://cloudstack.org/">CloudStack</a> , which became, in fact, a direct competitor to OpenStack. <br><br>  Mikos went on the offensive: he compared OpenStack with the Soviet Union, ‚Äúa huge collective farm, where everyone supposedly works for the good of society, but there were no results of this work, and there is no way to foresee it‚Äù (it‚Äôs nice to say nothing :)).  According to Mikos, Eucalyptus is moving in the same direction as its customers, and customers are most loyal to AWS.  ‚ÄúIf suddenly another cloud-based API becomes a worthy competitor to AWS, then we will most likely support it, and if it is OpenStack, then we have nothing against it,‚Äù says Mikos, ‚Äúbut I honestly don‚Äôt expect it.  We will be happy to support someone who provides a new decent API, but I have no idea who is capable of it now. ‚Äù <br><br>  Thus ended the ‚Äúideological clash‚Äù of an ardent supporter of open-source and two rational businessmen.  And who do you think is right in this dispute? <br><br>  Original Text Writer: Kevin Fitchard <br>  Link to the original: <a href="http://gigaom.com/cloud/if-aws-is-the-walmart-of-cloud-is-openstack-the-soviet-union/">gigaom.com/cloud/if-aws-is-the-walmart-of-cloud-is-openstack-the-soviet-union</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/147072/">https://habr.com/ru/post/147072/</a></p>
