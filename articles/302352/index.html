But maybe something else.</i>  <i>What to expect and demand business from an internet marketing company.</i>  <i>On the areas of responsibility of the web studio on the example of a music box.</i> <br><br>  When looking for a company that will promote Internet site promotion, almost everyone asks the manager a question: ‚ÄúWhat percentage of sales growth do you guarantee me?‚Äù And if a company calls you a number from the threshold, then you can safely not believe it.  Because a good internet marketer will never guarantee a specific amount of sales - it is impossible to calculate. <br>  Remember the popular video in which the Swedish musician and inventor Martin Moulin plays a big musical car with balls?  The machine (unlike other similar ones) is beautiful because it is not useless - it plays music, and not disposable - it can repeat the action almost infinitely. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/IvUU8joBb1Q%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgiJGru7vykIr0CGQ5DrOnknHpG-g" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

      Martin rotates the wheel, the system captures metal balls from the ‚Äúreservoir‚Äù and leads them further along the ‚Äúinsides‚Äù of the car.  For sound, it is necessary that the mechanisms work smoothly, and the ball falls out at the right time and at the right point. <br><br><h2>  Business machine </h2><br>  So here.  Internet promotion is the mechanism by which the ‚Äúballs come into the tank‚Äù, that is, customers get to your site. <br><a name="habracut"></a>  And further, in order for a purchase to take place, the coordinated work of the ‚Äúorganism‚Äù in which they fell (of your business) is necessary.  And here everything is important: website design, information on it, user scenarios, embedded services, work of a call center or manager, simple authorization, incoming letters on the generated order in time (and not to the Spam folder), meeting delivery times, product quality which will not be returned in the end.  After all, only then does the purchase occur?  And if a client for himself by all the criteria put a "tick", then he will gladly fall into your "business machine" again.  As conceived in the mechanism of the "box" Moulin. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/77a/a01/f0a/77aa01f0a0be457da9e091cb4656be70.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  Are you sure that on your site "everything is clear"? </h2><br>  The behavior of the person who got to the site can be compared with the action of the large and multi-level Goldberg machine (as in the video) - a device that performs a simple action in a non-standard way.  Buying is a simple action, right? <br>  By typing a search query or clicking on a banner, the user enters the site and tries to navigate there.  Let's say you sell dresses.  Here is an approximate list of questions from your potential client who came to the site (Svetlana, 24, personnel manager, was bored at dinner and wanted to arrange virtual shopping): <br><br><ul><li>  Where did I go?  Do they sell dresses here? </li><li>  Where to click to see how much a dress costs? </li><li>  Sell ‚Äã‚Äãin Novosibirsk?  Is there a delivery? </li><li>  I need a long blue dress.  How to find all the long blue dresses here? </li><li>  And you can still look turquoise? </li><li>  How to compare these dresses?  What material are they from? </li><li>  Where are the dresses sewn?  Are they branded? </li><li>  How to determine what size I need?  Can I do a fitting? </li><li>  How to order?  How much is shipping?  How long to wait for an order? </li><li>  How to pay?  Are there any payment options? </li><li>  Where is the guarantee that I will not be deceived? </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8ff/328/ab6/8ff328ab69af492d8c6b26f34316c6bd.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And it is important for you not to interfere with each new question and it is accessible to answer it, and even better - get ahead.  It turns out that a simple purchase is done in a rather non-standard way, if traps and barriers are placed on the site, which can simply ‚Äúbreak the mechanism‚Äù - lead to the fact that Svetlana does not find the answer, closes the tab and returns to dinner, or goes to the competitors website. <br><br><h2>  And where is the online promotion? </h2><br>  Agree, the promotion company that you hired has nothing to do with the work of the site, the manager, the delivery service, the suppliers whose work is described above?  She brings the "balls" (leads Svetlana) to your site.  You and your business processes are already responsible for the rest. <br>  Sales are the result and responsibility of not one process, but the sum of the actions of the entire business machine. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3da/489/bfd/3da489bfd26a41e9ad099db66642612f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  If you want people on your site to buy, consider its integrated promotion.  During it, experts test the site, issue recommendations on usability, design, services, content.  This means that if the recommendations for improving the site are implemented, then you will not only be brought to the site with a ‚Äúbucket of balls‚Äù, but they will also check by what scenarios these balls will roll, will they get into the necessary goal, can they put the goods in the basket and pay with Maestro card.  However, this does not guarantee you 100 sales from 100 visits.  Since even the paid order is confirmed by the manager, collected by the packer, delivered to the courier, the quality of the ordered item will depend on the supplier.  But this guarantees you N people who go to your site and get acquainted with your offer. <br><br><h2>  Then why do I need online promotion? </h2><br>  In any case, a holistic approach is important, including your activity on the Internet.  And if you want your ‚Äúmachine‚Äù to work without failures and generate income, then it needs constant professional technical support in everything (and constant ‚Äúrefueling‚Äù by customers, of course).  The main thing is to synchronize its processes so that they work for the sake of one goal - to leave customers satisfied enough that they would come to you again and again with pleasure. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/302352/">https://habr.com/ru/post/302352/</a></p>
