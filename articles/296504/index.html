They did not study at MIT, they do not have a degree in computer science and they probably still do not understand programming.  And all because in the field of technology, people are required not only to engage in development, but also to make a business out of these developments and further increase it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4f5/6f7/1e6/4f56f71e6bc74d27aa17daa74945a292.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Here are some tips to help you find your place in this progressive sector of the economy.</b>

    <h4>  1. Search in the right place. </h4><h6>  Despite the fact that many people from your environment (at least parents) are trying to impose on you work in large corporations, because  they seem to be safe for them, start-ups are also a great place to start building a career.  Being a new member of the team, you can not only immediately make a significant contribution, but also penetrate into various areas of the company. <br><br>  In most corporations, there are fairly clear boundaries between divisions: working in one department, an employee is unlikely to be able to try himself in another.  In startups, the opposite is true: one person will be able (and most likely will have to) try himself in various roles, gaining a completely diverse experience in a short period of time.  But this does not mean at all that you definitely need to get settled only in an emerging startup.  Try to contact those who already have funding for a venture fund, and / or those who have already been successfully operating for several years.  Companies existing on the market from five to ten years can also be considered as start-ups to some extent and at the same time can offer workers a number of advantages: from the social package to the trendy working space. </h6><br><br><h4>  2. Find a suitable area </h4><h6>  If you are attracted by a start-up culture, then start searching for a startup in the field you are interested in.  Do you like fashion?  Find a fashion startup.  Do you like studying languages?  In this area, startups also exist and are developing.  Since childhood is interesting medicine?  And there is something for you.  In general, you understand the essence. <br><br>  The world of startups is huge.  And despite the fact that most of them are somehow related to technology, for their formation and development requires specialists with completely different competencies.  Find out what your soul is for, and find a company whose goals will be compatible with your personal ones. </h6><br><br><h4>  3. Find a suitable role. </h4><h6>  As soon as you decide on the area you are interested in, it is necessary to find companies operating in this area (the benefit is the Internet with various ratings and selections), visit their sites and find out about existing opportunities (vacancies). <br><br>  Pay attention not only to such positions as a programmer, developer or software architect, consider positions in sales, business development, marketing, operations management, staff recruitment, etc.  Or, if you are ready to plunge into the world of technology a little deeper, try searching for yourself ‚Äúhybrid‚Äù (techno-functional) roles that are often in demand, for example, the role of a project manager, business analyst or consultant. <br><br>  Considering these positions, think about what you can bring to the company.  Are you overly persistent, sociable and self-confident?  The position of a sales manager may suit you.  Do you meticulously verify all the details?  In this case, the position of the project manager will be most suitable for you. </h6><br><br><h4>  4. Create a position for yourself </h4><h6>  This task will be quite difficult to do if you work in an already established company and / or this is your first job after university.  However, despite all the difficulties, you can always try to present yourself and your strengths to the representatives of a startup in the best light - this is how a large number of people find work at the moment.  Depending on the size of the startup, its representatives may not know who exactly they need, and what they should do. <br><br>  You can go further: find out what problems the company has at the moment, and accordingly propose their solution.  Make the company need you and your abilities. </h6><br><br><h4>  5. Teach materiel </h4><h6>  Many people working in technology do not have programming skills.  Instead, they often have a broad outlook and strategic thinking: it is these qualities that allow them to manage their business on an everyday basis.  It is not necessary to be a developer in order to work in this field, but an understanding of the basic technical concepts will be a significant advantage for you. <br><br>  If you want to work in the marketing department, take a close look at, for example, what is contained in PPC, SEO and UX concepts.  If you are more attracted to sales, thoroughly examine the product, all its technical features, as well as the features of competitors.  In the event that your choice fell on e-commerce, an understanding of business processes, as well as the possibilities of using big data, can allow you to succeed. </h6><br><br><h4>  6. Show your zeal and active life position </h4><h6>  There is a widespread belief that representatives of generation Y are lazy and irresponsible.  Prove the opposite.  List in the resume all types of activity in which you were somehow involved in the years of study at the university.  Were the club president on skydiving?  Write about it.  Took an active part in the student council?  Give this one line.  Played in a band?  Yes, and insert that too. <br><br>  All types of activity to which you have devoted a significant amount of your time on an ongoing basis will help you prove to a potential employer that you will also apply to work.  In addition, it is likely that one of the activities you mentioned will be a topic to start a conversation.  There is a very good chance that at least with one of the interviewers you will have some common interests.  If you discuss them with him, then the interviewer has a much more favorable impression about you, which, you will agree, can seriously increase your chances. <br></h6><br><br>  Take <a href="http://icanchoose.ru/blog/test-kakoj-tip-kompanii-tebe-podojdyot-20/">our test and find out what type of pombanii suits you.</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296504/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296504/</a></p>
