  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Russian "Indigo" spoke in Swedish</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <a href="http://www.mctcop.net/">MCT</a> completed a deal to sell <a href="http://www.tele2.ru/">Tele2 a</a> 100% stake in the Dutch offshore Vostok Mobile <nobr>Severo-Zapad</nobr> , which is the sole shareholder of the mobile operators Arkhangelsk Mobile Networks and Novgorod Telecommunications, and also owns controlling stakes in Murmansk Mobile Network and Parma Mobile " (Komi Republic).  At the same time, Tele2 agreed with the minority shareholders of the last two operators to repurchase their shares, as a result of which the Swedes will become their sole shareholders.  The total amount of the transaction was $ 35 million. <br><br>  Initially, all four cellular operators worked in AMPS / dAMPS standards, but subsequently switched to the more modern GSM standard.  With their sale over a ten-year history of the stay of MCT in Russia has ended.  The corporation was founded in 1992 specifically for the development of telecommunications in Russia and the CIS countries.  The peak of its activity came in 2000/01, when MCT, having agreed on the acquisition of two foreign telecommunication holdings - RTDC and Vostok Mobile, consolidated various shareholdings of 25 Russian cellular operators.  In order to build a unified federal network, MCT even <a href="http://www.comnews.ru/index.cfm%3Fid%3D1664">developed a</a> new brand, <a href="http://www.indigo.ru/">Indigo</a> . <br><br>  However, such ambitious plans collapsed in 2002, when MCT was <a href="http://www.comnews.ru/index.cfm%3Fid%3D3473">unable to complete the acquisition of RTDC</a> and the holding eventually went to the ‚ÄúSt. Petersburg‚Äù group of telecommunications operators.  After that, MCT began to gradually sell off its remaining assets.  The main buyers were the companies <a href="http://www.comnews.ru/index.cfm%3Fid%3D7175">Mobile TeleSystems (MTS)</a> and Tele2, which bought out six mobile operators each from the Americans.  Three more operators were acquired by the St. Petersburg group of telecommunications operators, and one by Sibirtelecom, which is part of the Svyazinvest holding.

      ‚ÄúThe Tele2 deal completes our planned exit from the Russian cellular market, allowing the company to concentrate its resources on Central Asian assets that have a much greater potential for growth,‚Äù said Garth Self, President of MCT Russia.  Now MCT retains controlling stakes in Tajik operators Somoncom and Indigo-Tajikistan, as well as Uzbek operator Koskom.  In addition, MCT owns 12% of the second-largest Afghan mobile operator Roshan. <br><br>  As for Tele2, after making this purchase, it received a representative office in 17 Russian regions.  ‚ÄúThis acquisition is intended to strengthen our already strong position in the rapidly growing Russian mobile communications market, where we rank fourth among Russian telecommunications operators,‚Äù said Tele2 President Lars-Johan Jarnheimer.  ‚ÄúWe are very pleased with the growth dynamics of TELE2 Russia and look forward to further successful development.‚Äù  It should be noted that the Swedes made their entry into the Russian market in 2001 by buying the assets of the investment corporation <a href="http://www.millicom.com/">Millicom International Cellular</a> , which also has American roots. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe purchase of MCT assets disproves rumors that the Tele2 business in Russia is developing poorly and the company intends to sell its assets,‚Äù said <nobr>IKS-Consulting</nobr> senior expert Margarita Zobnina.  ‚ÄúOf course, they will not be able to catch up with the big three mobile operators, but it is quite possible to seriously press their positions in some regions.‚Äù </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4183/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4183/</a></p>
