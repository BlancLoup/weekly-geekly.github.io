      We noticed that mistakes are often repeated and made separate issues with small <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/logomachine/blog/338270/">‚Äúhelp‚Äù</a> .  And once a month they decided to play on a large scale - to make a real redesign for one of the lucky ones.  This time, ‚ÄúTaxi Bonus‚Äù, the corporate identity of which we will correct today, has become so lucky.  Such a logo was a "Taxi Bonus": <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mg/te/xz/mgtexzbv5bg0_-uehvuqm6fbmlq.png" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Let's start in order: the first problem is that the logo is not supported by the corporate style.  There is just a sign, but using only a logo is difficult to brand something. <br><br>  However, it is very important for a taxi service to be able to brand: how is the site?  business cards drivers?  in the end the cars themselves?  With one logo, without corporate colors, elements - it is difficult to become recognizable. <br><br>  The second problem ‚ÄúTaxi Bonus‚Äù - everything, including social networks and printed materials, is decorated in different styles.  Logo - a real chaos.  Sometimes it is written in different fonts, sometimes the word ‚Äútaxi‚Äù disappears.  How can you remember such a logo if it is elusive and always looks different? <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bk/ny/j0/bknyj0nz3uj6ohk52fv4n-t0cre.png" alt="image"><br>  <i>Site</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ap/hy/k7/aphyk7zdo6qezxw-6a6uh94nmu0.png" alt="image"><br>  <i>In contact with</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_h/kc/ub/_hkcubsfxysntxu9onia-msqzaq.png" alt="image"><br>  <i>Printed products</i> <br><br>  There is another nuance - the shape of the heart is lost due to the pixel style, if it is reduced or increased: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kw/bg/lp/kwbglpr4z38xugjm47fz1nudkj4.png" alt="image"><br><br>  And the red color, in combination with the heart, is more likely to be associated with a hospital or pharmacy than with a taxi.  Again, all this greatly impairs brand awareness. <br><h3><br>  Bonus Taxi Solution </h3><br>  We start with an idea.  Since this is a redesign, we will not change it much.  Simply ‚Äúscrewing‚Äù to the desired state - we will make both classical and modern at the same time, and also use pixel art in the whole corporate style. <br><br>  <i>Sign</i> <br>  The sign lacks ‚Äúweight‚Äù, the color elements fall apart as the logo is enlarged or reduced.  This is easy to fix - you need to increase the sign, and place the taxis in the heart.  To continue this corporate history, we made checkers along the edges of the mark; now it can be used as a corporate element. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/no/ee/ur/noeeurxmfkcb_vy57o3_rbupafe.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Ideas and the process of changing the sign: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/eb/2z/id/eb2zid2rasqumvtmffpiel801ua.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Pixel style taxi can be continued in this way: make a light box. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ef/g0/uw/efg0uwfuo6dm71gnwzhqf1i11sq.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Of course, this is a decent investment.  But it will work positively - it can become a feature of the service, and a taxi will be recognizable during the day, at night and in any weather. <br><br>  <i>Fonts</i> <br>  The sign turned out to be interesting and quite active, so you won't have to <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/logomachine/blog/337312/">play with fonts</a> here.  We select a simple font, and so that it can be used separately from the sign, we add branded "pixels": <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/7w/kb/17/7wkb17wrvxdivtyvk22pme-phbg.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>Layout</i> <br>  Usually logos are used in different ways: on the website, signs, in booklets and other media.  A sign must be able to adapt to each shape and size in order to look organic. <br><br>  To do this, you need a layout of the logo - we are thinking out options in advance: if the logo will be on a vertical surface, on a horizontal surface or will it not be possible to use it completely? <br><br>  We made the layout options for all occasions: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gi/xj/xd/gixjxdrnazwfa8qslu8fwam4jve.png" alt="image"><br><br>  It is also important to understand how the logo will look on different backgrounds: dark, white, color.  It is not always an option to use the sign on only one background: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ax/pf/yg/axpfygk5umexywks-17o0_idkcy.png" alt="image"><br><br>  In the corporate style, we continued the theme of pixel art.  In the beginning, they decided to try on a new design for the main carrier ‚ÄúBonus Taxi‚Äù - a car. <br><br>  But there was a problem: the original red color of the company turned the car into an ambulance, and the pixel pattern turned into a splash of blood.  Habitual "taxi" yellow - also gave bad associations. <br><br>  Therefore, the main color we chose orange.  Warm and bright color made the corporate identity recognizable and juicy.  You can see the entire selection history on the thumbnails: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ik/pv/ib/ikpvibkmmj2tdjfcyitzd_v5byk.png" alt="image"><br><br>  As a result, the machines turned out like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rd/qb/pc/rdqbpcxeduciypa7vh3ysgpovdc.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Even for a taxi, you can make branded T-shirts, it is not difficult, but it will be easy to remember: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/f7/qi/8y/f7qi8y0_tbj114qoo9hmwnnadau.png" alt="image"><br><br>  What else can you use for a taxi?  For example, brand icons. <br><br>  How can they help?  And what if they distribute to customers, drivers?  Imagine how many people can become a walking advertisement for a service. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xy/l0/8m/xyl08mq1hwt6vlmr1hi_1y76s6e.png"><br><br>  Business cards, discount flyers are also important for the service: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wf/j0/-5/wfj0-54aosqwidhs97qih3estsm.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Having received a business card or hearing about the company ‚ÄúTaxi Bonus‚Äù, a person will try to find it on the Internet.  And when he finds the site or Vkontakte group, he should have no doubts that this is exactly the company he heard about and was looking for. <br><br>  To do this, we tried on the corporate identity on the company's website, and for the Vkontakte group we made an example of the design of the post: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/i1/jc/2_/i1jc2_u5q8gixjo_kndoyadgcoo.png" alt="image"><br>  <i>Site and mobile application</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rk/vd/he/rkvdhepjsyurc0kwj2v8ruxje4y.png" alt="image"><br>  <i>VK group</i> <br><br>  The form of the bonus coin, which we used as an element of the corporate identity, can be used for animation on the website or in the application: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vz/jc/12/vzjc12mvi7pxxi2woqmgmzkhq1q.gif" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Total </h3><br><ul><li>  After finalizing the logo has found the correct shape and color.  This will help ‚ÄúTaxi Bonus‚Äù to be recognizable, as well as eliminate the possibility of confusion with other taxi services. </li><li>  Now the sign can be used both in large and in small size, without loss of readability, and the font part will be the same everywhere.  The logo can be assembled both in the horizontal version and in the vertical version. </li><li>  The company has branded elements and color combinations, this allows us to understand that we are facing the same company, and not several different ones, as it was before. </li></ul><br><br>  If you want to participate in our section, then send your design directly in the comments or in our <a href="https://vk.com/logomachine">public VK</a> .  As always, good luck to you and your projects! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dx/ix/d9/dxixd9ux-9ikwzdw3f2ifdsazkq.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  Prepared by Slepchevich Victoria for Log Machine </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/341100/">https://habr.com/ru/post/341100/</a></p>
