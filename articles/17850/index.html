  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Apple closes the ThinkSecret.com insider site</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The popular site <a href="http://www.thinksecret.com/">ThinkSecret.com</a> , which specialized in distributing insider information about Apple, will be closed by court order.  The three-year persecution of Internet journalists by a large company ended in the latter‚Äôs success.  True, this success is not complete, because Apple lawyers were also seeking the release of sources of information - the names of those insiders from among Apple employees who leaked interesting information about future Apple products.  However, the journalists did not surrender their informants, and at least in this respect <a href="http://www.thinksecret.com/news/settlement.html">they consider the</a> outcome of the trial to <a href="http://www.thinksecret.com/news/settlement.html">be their victory</a> .  In fact, the process ended by mutual agreement prior to the sentencing. <br><br>  For several years, ThinkSecret.com has been the source of the most reliable information about Apple‚Äôs plans and future products.  For example, in 2003-2004, it was predicted that, among other things, KeyNote 2.0, iSync and Mac would yield up to $ 500.  A month after the publication of the ‚Äúrumors‚Äù about the new ‚ÄúMac,‚Äù the Mac Mini was indeed introduced, and the rest of the rumors also came true. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  As you know, information about future products is carefully hidden by marketers at Apple.  Since information hiding is a key element of the company's marketing policy, the prosecution of the authors of ThinkSecret.com has become a matter of principle.  That is why Apple for several years went to the intended goal and finally achieved its goal. <br><br>  The creator of the site ThinkSecret.com said that he was pleased with the agreement reached and that he did not have to give out his sources.  Now, Harvard's third year student, Nick Ciarelli, opened this site when he was only 13 years old.  He received a summons from Apple in January 2005.  The free lawyer was provided to him by the human rights organization Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF).

      In March 2005, human rights activists filed a counterclaim, after which Apple seemed to have lost interest in the case.  Nothing happened, Nick Charelli continued to publish rumors, and Apple continued to send him threatening letters.  And just now the final point was put in this sluggish process. <br><br>  via <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do%3Fcommand%3DprintArticleBasic%26articleId%3D9053798">Computerworld</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/17850/">https://habr.com/ru/post/17850/</a></p>
