Today, fifteen materials from our ‚Äú <a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/mirhifi/">Hi-Fi World</a> ‚Äù are waiting for you, in which we speak about Soviet-era radio plays, the present and future of streaming services and trends in the podcast market. <br><br> <a href="https://habr.com/company/audiomania/blog/424167/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/os/yo/vy/osyovytjkmbjlb5yrdidq0a_e6u.jpeg"></a> <a name="habracut"></a><br>  <font color="#A9A9A9"><i>Photo by <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/28369035%40N05/31446712524/">Darren Cowley</a> / PD</i></font> <br><br><h2>  About radio and radio presenters </h2><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-4956.html">‚ÄúHow it works‚Äù: radio is the end of a beautiful era.</a>  In this article, we understand how the radio works: what kind of software do radio presenters use, what is the broadcast format and how many people do they need to launch a radio station.  We tell you how the radio attracts the audience and why lately the interest in traditional radio has been falling. </li></ul><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-4991.html">6 myths about radio presenters.</a>  We discuss popular myths about working on the radio and talk about how the radio host‚Äôs day goes, who writes the news for the release and why live broadcasts are not a hobby, but painstaking daily work.  In parallel, we will give a couple of tips on how to ‚Äúfill a vacancy‚Äù at the station. </li></ul><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-5394.html">Sound shows: very well forgotten old.</a>  In the mid-1920s, almost everything that existed in the cultural field ‚Äî books, comics, and musicals ‚Äî became radio-spectros.  For radio, many well-known dramatist authors wrote, from Bertolt Brecht to Max Frish.  This article is about how the history of radio plays began, and how it ended.  We will share the most famous radio shows and tell interesting stories related to them: why the ‚ÄúWar of the Worlds‚Äù by HG Wells is considered the ‚Äúmother of fake news‚Äù and which of the old plays are still played on the radio. </li></ul><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-5425.html">Russian radio plays: from the ‚ÄúBaby Monitors‚Äù to ‚ÄúSolaris‚Äù.</a>  Radio plays were popular among Soviet and later Russian listeners.  In this material, we recall the projects that influenced the generation of schoolchildren in the 1970s, talk about radio shows from books by science fiction writers Brothers Strugatsky and Stanislav Lem, as well as radio plays based on works of Russian classics.  What episode was crossed out by the Soviet censor from Solaris, but entered into a radio show?  What heroine of Dostoevsky‚Äôs novel was voiced by Faina Ranevskaya?  What famous performance was written specifically for the radio?  Answers to these questions can be found in the article. </li></ul><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-5445.html">Fairy tales in the USSR: the story of "child" vinyl.</a>  Audio shows for children were recorded on vinyl and flexible records of the record company Melodiya.  Famous singers and actors took part in the work on them.  In the voice of Oleg Tabakov, Ali Baba speaks in ‚ÄúAli Baba and 40 thieves‚Äù, Mikhail Boyarsky voiced the king in ‚ÄúThe Bremen Town Musicians‚Äù.  Songs of Vladimir Vysotsky sound in "Alice in Wonderland."  We offer together with us to remember your favorite works from childhood. </li></ul><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-4965.html">‚ÄúLet's dance again‚Äù: why is it still too early to bury the radio?</a>  Another article on the topic of radio and its future.  This time we understand if there is an alternative to broadcasting and why people still listen to FM radio.  We will discuss the evolution of the format and the new modern approaches to broadcasting. </li></ul><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-5432.html">What radio listeners and radio hosts hate.</a>  Not all audio content on the radio is perceived by the audience positively.  Exactly as not all messages of the listeners evoke a positive reaction from the presenters.  What is more annoying - a call asking you to say hello in the middle of a serious discussion or a proposal to change the music format?  Let's try to understand mutual claims and look at them from different sides. </li></ul><br><h2>  About streaming services </h2><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-5464.html">What is it: the Russian market of streaming services.</a>  According to the report of the RIAA Association, in 2017 the most of the profits of the music industry were brought by streaming services.  In this article, we focused on the Russian streaming market, which is also on the rise.  We are talking about the main trends in the industry: how streaming platforms deal with piracy and what cooperation with mobile operators gives them. </li></ul><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-5128.html">Comparative test of Internet radio stations with a lossless stream.</a>  Currently, a number of audiophile services, such as Tidal, provide access to lossless radio as part of a subscription.  However, in Russia this service is not yet available.  Therefore, here we propose to consider the online radio stations, which give listen to Hi-Res-audio without restrictions.  We will tell you how to set up a lossless stream and test Internet stations with different music formats. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/9y/t8/je/9yt8jee0k-zmxduzkwutd4e2jta.jpeg"><br>  <font color="#A9A9A9"><i>Photo <a href="https://pxhere.com/en/photo/641496">PxHere</a> / PD</i></font>
