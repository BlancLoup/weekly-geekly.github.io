  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Increasing Conversion - A Headache for Online Stores</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  E-commerce is growing every year by 25-30%.  Given the growing number of players and customers on the Internet (for 2013, 22 million people buy online), the competition between online stores for each person individually, for each purchase, is also growing.  While in general it is not necessary to expect more people on the Internet - the growth rate of the Internet audience is slowing down a lot.  What to do online shopping? <br><br>  To date, it is not difficult to attract traffic to the site using seo, contextual advertising, targeted advertising, banners.  And the cost of attraction, I must say, is growing from year to year! <br>  But the traffic is not a panacea.  As you know, only 1-5% of the audience makes a purchase immediately, at the time of the first visit to the site.  Knowing this, marketers and owners of online stores tend to captivate and attract the visitor in all possible ways for the sake of making a purchase.  Here we recall clever Roma with their dances, bears and guitars, which will leave anyone penniless. <br>  Bright scarves and tambourines from marketers are various "chips" on the site: banners announcing special offers;  application forms;  popup windows;  callback forms, online consultants, etc. <br><br>  Interesting numbers: <br>  ‚Ä¢ Statistics persistently suggests that it is necessary to use various tools and techniques to increase conversion: ‚ÄúOrganizations that have increased the conversion of their projects over the past 12 months, use 45% more different methods than those who did not increase it‚Äù. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Schwan's company (http://www.schwans.com) has a site with the highest conversion in the world - 40.6-41.2%, using a pop-up window at the entrance, personalized recommendations for a purchase. <br>  ‚Ä¢ 86% of online store owners already use conversion tools, but often do not see a sharp increase in conversion and note problems in the usability of the tools. <br>  ‚Ä¢ 53% of Internet companies still do not work with refusals to purchase, leaving the site without a purchase or targeted action. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  However, we, as marketers, at one time faced serious problems when working with tools to increase conversion.  The fact is that almost all of them are scattered and solve a separate task: only to attract to communication on the site, only to give hints, only to collect reviews, only to increase loyalty - instead of approaching the problem in the complex. <br>  In addition, the use of hundreds of tools at the same time eats a lot of time.  Remember your browser, where there are several tabs with personal accounts of services.  And in each you need to track the statistics, keep in mind the time of the next payment for services.  And how to calculate the overall statistics or make an analysis of the effectiveness of each tool separately?  Impossible ... or Excel to help us! <br>  At the time of preparing the summary reports, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Witget project as a designer was born, where you can put together your perfect set of ‚ÄúConversion Enhancements‚Äù by choosing the right knitwear, all at once or some: <br>  - to inform about the action, <br>  - to collect contacts, <br>  - to vote <br>  - to attract to the group in social networks and much more. <br>  All Vitzhets can be customized, styled as a website. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bcc/ddd/d53/bccdddd536c5ca5bbadd094bd6b21487.png" alt="image"><br>  I remember how we, seeing a bright and intriguing pop-up window on the website of a successful online store, decided to certainly place such a tool to attract attention and collect contacts in themselves.  But what did we have to go through?  Making our own pop-up window cost us 15,000 rubles.  The creation process took almost 3 weeks.  The designer replaces images in a popap for 300-500 rubles (depending on the complexity of the picture).  And if you need to change the field to collect contacts or change the time of the show - you need to run to the developers.  A more complex solution, for example, with showing only new or returning only will cost a tidy sum.  If you are not a shark ecommerce, then such expenses are beyond your power! <br>  Then we believed even more that Witget would be in demand. <br>  Now it allows you to work with Big Data: collect information about users (statistics of visits, interests) by url and utm-tags.  Thus, it is possible to form personal offers to clients, not mass or cohort ones.  In our opinion, this is already the last century.  Behind personalization is the future. <br>  In Witget you can collect contacts, conduct a / b tests of vitzhets, follow the statistics of effectiveness.  Based on these data, an autobroker will soon appear in the service, who will choose for himself to show visitors the most effective whitels depending on many factors (user interests, company objectives, time of day, day of the week, and even weather). <br>  Another feature of Witget is simplicity and convenience.  We are marketers, and not designers or web designers of html at all, so it‚Äôs important for us to create a witte could be quickly - in just 2-3 minutes from a ready-made template: you take a template, choose a style, change headings and text, set up a show, put activity and you keep - and voila - we watch the growth of conversion! <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fb1/a48/8b0/fb1a488b0ad2942c29e8d8f60cafce65.png" alt="image"><br>  Another Witget chip is one small script optimized for Google and Yandex, which is easily installed on the site.  It is important that you do not have 17 codes from different services that may conflict with each other and disturb the search engines with their presence, but one line of code, white and fluffy. <br>  While Witget works in beta format.  But now we are gradually connecting sites to the service.  You can request access to Witget on witget.com or send an email to info@witget.com. </div>
