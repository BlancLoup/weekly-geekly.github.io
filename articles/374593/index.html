  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Initial presentation on mathematical modeling of spiritual processes</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  What is a man?  How does he think?  Why does he sometimes do this and sometimes differently?  Mankind cannot answer all these questions, but at the same time wants to create a supercomputer that will be a full-fledged person.  We create artificial intelligence (hereinafter - AI), we try to create something that will be as smart as a person, but we do not understand how a person feels. <br><br>  Yes, we can describe some feelings through emotions, but how can we make the machine able not only to think like a person, but also to feel if we can describe it, but we cannot program emotions?  To do this, we need to learn how to model our thoughts with the help of mathematics and computer science.  This problem, the problem of modeling spiritual processes for me is the most attractive in the study of AI. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  To begin with, we need to understand what components the spiritual world of man consists of.  I distinguish three components: spirit, thought, and faith.  I will not dwell on the last two, I‚Äôll go straight to the spirit, it‚Äôs still closer to the subject.  So let's analyze the spirit and understand what it is.  Everyone, I think, watched the play ‚ÄúDays of the Turbins‚Äù.  On the example of this performance, we can see how the spirit of the main characters of this production is changing.  At the beginning of the performance, ‚ÄúSo for the king, for the Motherland and the faith,‚Äù and at the end, ‚ÄúSo for the union of the people's commissars.‚Äù  The spirit determines the mental state of a person at every moment of his life. <br><br>  In order for us to create a model of the existential process, we certainly need different components.  I offer the simplest components: good and evil. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

      <br>
      And how can we simulate such a complex thing as the spiritual world of man with the help of only two components that are primitive at first glance?  If we understand how these concepts interact with each other, we will understand how spirit works.  Suppose that we really only have "good" and "evil."  Then we will try to analyze an excerpt from the poem of Nikolai Hungarian: <br><blockquote>  Smelling roses, <br>  Shady remember the garden <br>  And the word gentle "love" <br>  What did you tell me then. <br></blockquote><br>  Let us examine each line separately: ‚ÄúInhaling the fragrance of roses‚Äù ‚Äîfor this phrase we cannot understand the feelings of the person who says this, but we can assume that this is a neutral feeling for him, as for most people.  Accordingly, we can imagine that this is neither yes nor no, that is, using our mathematical model, this will be the following scheme. <br><br>  Since in the following lines we see that the author has warm and good memories with this, we assume that this is not the best feeling, but also not neutral.  How, then, to make it, if initially we have two states: "Good" and "Evil"?  Everything is simpler: we can model it like this: ‚Äúthe good prevailing over evil‚Äù and shape it through the formula of mathematical logic.  I propose to use the negation of implication.  Then, if we denote good by 1, and evil by 0, then the condition ‚Äúgood prevailing over evil‚Äù we write 1 ‚Üõ 0 and get 1 in the answer, that is, good. <br><br>  Consider the second line in the same way as the first, so I will simply rewrite its result: 1 ‚Üõ 0 = 1. <br>  The fourth line goes along with the third, otherwise we will not be able to catch the mood of a person.  ‚ÄúAnd as if the gentle‚Äú love ‚Äùthat you told me then‚Äù is the line, we will try to model it.  Obviously, since the author writes about tender words, and the whole passage is in pleasant memories, here the person was absolutely and glad.  Then we can simply and without problems register a solid unit, as the degree of maximum good.  Again, we regard ‚Äúgood‚Äù as positive, and ‚Äúevil‚Äù as negative. <br><br>  As a result, we can simulate the existential processes of the hero of the author of the poem, which took place in it at that time, which is written by Nikolai Hungarian.  Then the final model looks like this: <br>  1 ‚Üõ 0 = 1 <br>  1 ‚Üõ 0 = 1 <br>  1 = 1 <br><br>  PS: I do not claim high marks, I was interested in telling you my vision of this problem, maybe you have any comments, ideas?  Write in the comments, please. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/374593/">https://habr.com/ru/post/374593/</a></p>
