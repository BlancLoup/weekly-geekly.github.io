  <section class="page js-page"><h1>About Fallout 3, modifications and additions</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  At first glance, what is Fallout 3?  Very short storyline.  And at first, she seems to be quite stupid: the lad starts up all serious in search of a father.  There are few additional quests.  There are about two dozen of them.  If you pass the game, not too deviating from the storyline, then the freedom of movement is somewhat ‚Äúbroken‚Äù - the main character all the time stumbles upon impassable obstructions that ‚Äúlead‚Äù him along a clearly defined path to the main goal.  SPECIAL balance (in role-playing, because balance in role-playing games is generally a myth) has been ruined for casual players: characteristics have little effect on skills, the combat system VATS, which allows you to pause the game and aim at different parts of the opponent's body, is simply amusing addition, no more.  It seems that everything is not so rosy, but ... <br><br><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_8kWR1cnCmlk/SS0iIrxcyzI/AAAAAAAAAoQ/Mj_8NMQhUkE/s400/fallout3.jpg"><br>  But in Fallout 3 there is a big world of the Metropolitan Wastes, to explore which is a very interesting activity.  It is surprising that the creators of the game tenderly reacted to the "unnecessary" in the casual passage of things.  Climbing into a forgotten god‚Äôs half-destroyed refuge, the main character will read tons of information about what happened there.  Walking through the remote corners of the vast territory will allow you to find interesting little things in the form of rare schemes for assembling artisanal weapons, baby dolls, adding characteristics points and just the funniest characters who can give tons of information.  For the passage is not necessary, but for the atmosphere - gorgeous. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  From the lyrics let's move, in fact, to why I decided to write this post.  I think everyone (playing in Fallout 3) noticed that Bethesda ‚Äúforgot‚Äù to release the SDK for those who want to delve into the game‚Äôs resources and change what they don‚Äôt like.  But despite this, modders have already, from the very beginning of Fallout 3, started poking around in files (even with a HEX editor) and edit, edit.  Recommend: <a href="http://www.fallout3nexus.com/">Fallout3Nexus</a> .  The site, which already has all the mods that change the gameplay of Fallout 3, leading it away from the gray console casualere towards the native PC-hardcore.  Fans will appreciate. <br><br>  And now about the most interesting.  Bethesda company still will release a complete set for modding and creating maps - The GECK And in December.  It will receive, of course, only PC users.  In addition, the developers have already promised players additional downloadable content (DLC), which will be available for both the Xbox 360 version of the game, and for the PC.

      This content will be divided into three parts.  The first, which will be released in January, will be called Operation Anchorage and will be a small piece of action-gameplay to free Anchorage from the Chinese Communists.  The Pitt - the second addition - in which players will be offered a stroll through the ruins of the city of Pittsburgh, will be released in February.  And in March, the fans are waiting for the third "addon" Broken Steel, which will allow to play after the completion of the main storyline and bring the line of confrontation between the Brotherhood of Steel and the Enclave into the game. <br><br>  So far there is no information on how the supplements will be published here.  I think that because of the damn StarForce 1C, Russian fans will not immediately be pleased with the novelties.  While they are generally busy editing the translation and minor bugs.  And, by the way, about the translation.  DJ Tridognayt, performed by Bonus from ‚ÄúFrom the screw‚Äù by Boris Repetur - is simply gorgeous.  More such voices in the voice acting. <br><br>  UPD: A little corrected post. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/45537/">https://habr.com/ru/post/45537/</a></p>
