For this, we singled out the year of our time and launched the annual training program: <br><br>  <b><a href="http://stratoplan.ru/school/">http://stratoplan.ru/school/</a></b> <br><br>  Today we would like to talk about 5 main reasons why, as it seems to us, people grow up in a crisis.

    <h3>  Reason number 1.  They understand that the crisis is in their heads. </h3><br>  What is a crisis?  This is a natural phenomenon.  Yesterday everything was fine, but today - hello New Year's tree!  Earthquake!  Or a flood!  Or here is the crisis!  The dollar is growing, the euro is annoying, politicians are acting out there. <br><br>  So what?  Have you changed anything?  Do you have less brains?  Has someone taken away your knowledge and skills?  Your future still depends on you more than on your president, prime minister and other deputies. <br><br>  Vladimir Zworykin invented the kinescope in the midst of the Great Depression.  And what, someone will say: "Well, of course, is it because the president was then ..." or "No wonder, because the party had power ..."?  Yes, no one remembers who was there in power, what was then the rate of the national currency, and how bootleggers were outraged.  But we have enjoyed the success of this particular person for decades. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Reason number 2.  They see that in a crisis it is easier to be noticeable. </h3><br>  In a crisis, most people start worrying about what they cannot influence: the price of oil, the country's gold and foreign exchange reserves, the politics of politicians ... When a person‚Äôs head is busy with something, it automatically spends less time on its work and its own development .  As a result, most people are treading water. <br><br>  And so it is impossible to say that people are working on themselves, but here they just collectively stand still.  Against this background, a person who does something conscious and purposeful becomes only more noticeable.  More noticeable - those who need to notice. <br><br><h3>  Reason number 3.  They know that after a crisis, growth always comes. </h3><br>  After any crisis - even the worst.  Whatever you do now, the crisis will end anyway.  Sooner or later.  And then it will be better than now. <br><br>  But what the understanding people are doing now is preparing the basis from which they start after the crisis.  No one knows when this will happen - in 2 years or in 5 years.  But right now, people who understand: they are laying the foundation and building assets. <br><br><h3>  Reason number 4.  Engaged in work on assets. </h3><br>  Now is the time when there is time (sorry for the tautology) to quietly work on their assets. <br><br>  A simple example.  Last week, the dollar jumped sharply up.  What do most people do at this moment?  Breaks into stores, defends wild queues to "invest" cheapening money in some new TV. <br><br>  What happens in 3 years?  TV is hopelessly outdated, and it is unlikely you will sell it even for 20% of the cost. <br><br>  Who got better from your actions?  It is clear to anyone: TV manufacturers and retail chains.  In fact, you worked on these guys. <br><br>  Consider another example.  A person sees that the dollar flies up, takes a part of his salary and buys a year of English tuition at some good school (spends as much as a TV costs), knowing that tomorrow this training will cost 2 times more. <br><br>  What happens in a year?  A person rises by 2 levels in English, gets due to this a new position (sometimes in a new company) with a salary increase of 20%.  As a result, already in the first 2 months he beats off the value of the money spent, and then just starts to get more.  Plus does not experience discomfort in foreign travel, talking with native speakers. <br><br>  Working on assets is what distinguishes those who are moving forward from those who are not moving.  Why do some people behave like this and others do otherwise  Why do some people quit developing their main asset while others do it all the time?  There is a fifth reason for this. <br><br><h3>  Reason number 5.  They understand why they need all this. </h3><br>  Since we have been studying for a long time, we constantly observed statistics that most students drop out in the middle when they have their first enthusiasm. <br><br>  The situation changed when we included one small addition to the program: tools for analyzing our own goals, which we called the strategic planning club. <br><br>  In our annual program, we decided to start with this.  Before proceeding with the courses, we suggest that you complete a few tests and write an essay about your goals.  After that, we sometimes speak personally with the person in order to understand which way he really would like to move.  And then we build an individual training program. <br><br>  We do not have the task to massively train everyone - we have the task to help each specific person. <br><br>  Friends, tonight, the entry into the annual program of the Stratoplan school of managers will be finally closed: <br><br>  <b><a href="http://stratoplan.ru/school/">http://stratoplan.ru/school/</a></b> <br><br>  At the moment, 350 people and 20+ companies have connected to us.  Many participants have already passed incoming testing and received our recommendations for a one-year training plan. <br><br>  Read the program of the school and understand that you need it.  If this is the case - come, we have something to work with you. <br><br>  Good luck and see you in the program! <br><br>  Slava Pankratov (@slavapankratov) and Alexander Orlov (@eagleson) <br>  Managers School Stratoplan <br><br>  PS our previous articles on anti-crisis topics: <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/stratoplan/blog/245199/">How does a state or business system behave in relation to you during a crisis?</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/stratoplan/blog/245317/">How the situation developed in 2008 and counter-examples of crisis thinking, behavior and results</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/stratoplan/blog/245455/">Solution in statics: counter-loading with information that is tested and useful in perspective (knowledge)</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/stratoplan/blog/245685/">Dynamic Solution Check: Idle Brain and Situational Anxiety</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/246571/">https://habr.com/ru/post/246571/</a></p>
