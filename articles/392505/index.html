All who want to buy a car first, lining up.  There are extreme lovers who took their place a couple of days ago. <br><br>  All this is similar to how the first iPhone usually buys when people take their place in the queue a few days before the start of sales.  Australian Andreas Stevens took his place on March 29 - he got in line with a backpack, a folding chair and a book about Ilona Mask.  What is the Tesla 3, why is an electric car waiting? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  What is it like? </h3><br>  According to rumors, the Model 3 will be a smaller copy of the Tesla Model S. On the other hand, Musk said that this electric car would not be like any of the other auto models.

      Musk calls the Model 3 design "impressive." <br><br><h3>  Electric vehicle dimensions </h3><br>  If the appearance of the novelty is a secret, then the dimensions have been reported for a long time.  It is known that the Model 3 will be 20% less than the Model S. The dimensions of the electric vehicle will be similar to the size of the Audi A4. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/694/1d3/00a/6941d300aa219a01431d25a4bb7ca8b4.jpg"><br><br>  The form, of course, must be different, but the dimensions are about the same, yes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3fa/82d/fac/3fa82dfaca17efc4d0128fa1c89bf90a.jpg"><br>  <i>And these are typical Tesla buyers.</i> <br><br><h3>  Large power reserve </h3><br>  According to the information that got into the network relatively long ago, Tesla 3 will have a cruising range of about 500 km.  But there is also evidence that it will not be 500 km, but all 750 - this should obviously be enough for most journeys.  At greater distances, motorists are not so often solved. <br><br><h3>  Everything is new, absolutely everything </h3><br>  Despite the fact that the electric car is built on the basis of the Model S platform, the developers have created most of the elements from scratch.  New power supply architecture, new type of electric motor, housing structure, etc.  Development started a few years ago, and just now ended. <br><br>  The service station of the company stated that the electric car ‚Äúwill surprise people with the number of innovations‚Äù.  Perhaps this also refers to the autopilot, the ‚Äúsmart‚Äù system, which has not yet become part of Model S. <br><br>  True, a fully autonomous electric car will not. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8d4/30c/8fe/8d430c8fe627c0ac9cf2875da91825b0.jpg"><br>  Someone came to Tesla to pre-order Tesla <br><br><h3>  And how much is this miracle? </h3><br>  The starting price is $ 35,000 in the USA.  But taxes have not yet been taken into account.  Plus, this is really a basic version, all other elements can be added for additional funds. <br><br><h3>  How to order? </h3><br>  Pre-orders on March 31 can only be done at Tesla points, and a pre-order will need to be paid a deposit of $ 1000.  <a href="https://www.teslamotors.com/findus">Here</a> you can check if there is a point in your region (it is clear that this function is for the USA). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5e2/004/653/5e2004653759135f674c49831476cab7.jpg"><br>  This guy wants to be the first in the US - for this he set up a tent and lives here, waiting for the start of sales <br><br>  But on the Network you can order an electric car already on April 1, so you can not worry about the points and $ 1,000. <br><br><h3>  And when orders start shipping? </h3><br>  Not earlier than at the end of 2017, unfortunately.  Yes, the presentation is today, but the fulfillment of the order will be somewhat delayed.  But what to do, fans of new technologies are ready to wait. <br><br>  Well, we will receive confirmation or refutation of the information mentioned above in a few hours during the presentation of Ilona Mask on the Tesla Model 3. By the way, it will be ‚Äúincomplete‚Äù, gradually the data on the new model of electric car will come from Tesla headquarters, will occur within a few days. <br><br>  UPD.  And here is the <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/273706/">presentation</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/392505/">https://habr.com/ru/post/392505/</a></p>
