I dreamed of flying since childhood, and after jumping with a parachute I fell ill completely, but besides the amazing feeling of flying, I also found something interesting. <br><br>  If I ever become a business coach, the first thing I will do is send a person to learn how to fly a paraglider. <br><br>  So far I have not seen a more suitable analogy with the launch of business projects, which can be experienced <i>physically in a short period of time</i> .  In my head, everything falls into place and the correct chain of action priorities is built.

      I will describe briefly the process of flight, and you try to connect the fantasy and draw analogies.  Sometimes I will prompt. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/a39/56b/706/a3956b706df5a82745c09a8f03571397.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Market analysis and testing </h4><br>  The first thing you can't fly without is suitable weather conditions. <br>  Wind speed and direction are the main criteria when choosing a place to fly. <br>  If they suit us, we leave.  In the first place, we put a ‚Äúsorcerer‚Äù (a special device that looks like a leaky net of light and dense matter) in order to see where the wind is blowing and approximately calculate its strength in order to understand how the paraglider will behave. <br><br><h4>  Preparing for the launch of the project </h4><br>  Next is the preparation for flight.  The layout of the paraglider, lines.  A paraglider is always laid out against the wind, so that it is properly filled with air.  Also, the size of the paraglider depends on your weight category. <br><br><h4>  Launch of the project </h4><br>  When the paraglider is laid out, you stand in front of it, pick up the lines and start moving. <br><br>  <i>The first steps are always the hardest, the paraglider pulls you back and you can literally slip in place.</i>  <i>At some point, you completely stop and you just need to wait until the paraglider is in a certain position, and now the main thing is to start to load it again with weight and go forward.</i>  <i>Otherwise, the paraglider will simply fall to the ground.</i> <i><br></i> <br>  When lifting a paraglider, it can be demolished to the side by the wind and it is necessary to run up to the side of the demolition in order to straighten its position. <br><br>  Then you just have to run in the direction of the slope to complete detachment from the ground and the beginning of the flight.  For a quick climb, you can use extras like a winch or a paramotor. <br><br><h4>  Project management and analytics system </h4><br>  By inertia paraglider always descends to the ground.  In order to stay in the air for a long time, you need to feel and catch the ascending currents.  There are two types - dynamic and thermal air currents.  Also in the air there are other types of air flow - for example, turbulent, where you can shake. <br><br>  It is very important to have a dashboard with you - a means of objective control of flight parameters: altitude, speed of ascent and descent, pressure, time, air temperature and much more. <br><br>  <b>And finally: never forget about the reserve, so as not to break.</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298912/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298912/</a></p>
