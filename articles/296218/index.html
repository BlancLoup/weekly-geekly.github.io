  <section class="page js-page"><h1>A review of Jeff Sutherland‚Äôs book Scrum. Revolutionary Project Management Method</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3af/80b/d36/3af80bd3686b4a7cbe8fb8937218c909.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Twenty years ago, Jeff Sutherland, together with Ken Schwaber, created and described Scrum, a methodology that is now one of the most widely used software development methodologies in the world.  A book of this level is a sin to miss, and even more so when it is translated into Russian, which is quite a rare phenomenon. <br><br>  Recently, the book ‚ÄúScrum.  A revolutionary project management method, ‚Äùand today I want to recommend it to you. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  First of all, you notice that the book is read very easily.  It balances on the verge of art and business literature.  I would like to note that the translation is very high-quality (many thanks to the publisher Myth), and the only thing that surprises is the translation of the name (in the original is the Scrum: The Art of Doing), but you can easily close your eyes to it.

      Jeff is a fan, and the main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe book is that Scrum is able to improve, and often get out of the abyss, absolutely any project, and despite some exaggeration - in most cases Jeff is right. <br>  The whole book is divided into chapters, which are the main accents of the Scrum framework, as well as its main advantages.  Separately, the first chapter is highlighted, which describes the times when the methodology was just born.  Read in one breath, impossible to tear off. <br><br>  Throughout the book, the author gives examples from real life, which clearly illustrate the issues raised.  Whether it‚Äôs the leader‚Äôs conviction to start using Scrum in the company or a way to raise the mood of the team, the author has a story for everything. <br>  And yes, we all see it every day, watch, participate and complain about bad organization, but Jeff puts it all on the shelves, he asks uncomfortable questions and makes us hear an unpleasant, but honest answer. <br><blockquote>  - How many Gantt charts have you encountered for your professional activities?  - I asked. <br>  ‚ÄúWith hundreds,‚Äù he said. <br>  - How many of them are true? <br>  ‚ÄúNone,‚Äù he answered, thinking for a moment. </blockquote><br>  In addition to good stories, the book has a lot of practical tips that can be applied, even the next day.  It is clear that Sutherland has accumulated quite a few of them - he has been introducing Scrum all his life, he has seen everything. <br>  And finally, the last chapter.  Personal pride of the creator of the methodology that really changes the world.  Using Scrum to solve the problems of poverty, poor education or corruption, there really is a reason for pride. <br><br>  I will not retell the book in more detail, it is necessary to read it (you can immediately after scrum guide). <br><br>  <b>To whom?</b> <br>  Anyone who has anything to do with Scrum, to develop, or to any project management, as well as all other people.  For scram masters and their managers, this is just a must-have book. <br>  For those who are just starting to get acquainted with Scrum, at the end of the book there is an application ‚ÄúImplementing Scrum.  Where to start "- a detailed description of everything you need to know to work successfully on the methodology. <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúBlame not the player, but the game‚Äù</i> <br>  <b>Book:</b> Scrum.  Revolutionary project management method <br>  <b>By:</b> Jeff Sutherland <br>  <b>Publisher:</b> <a href="http://www.mann-ivanov-ferber.ru/books/scrum/">Mann, Ivanov and Ferber</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296218/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296218/</a></p>
