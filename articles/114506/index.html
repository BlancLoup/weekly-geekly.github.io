  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Electronic and future pianist</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Information flow surrounds us from all sides.  Digital technology is squeezing out many ordinary things from our everyday life.  Pay attention to how many objects and actions, which have not so long been usual, have completely disappeared or they are striving to disappear from our being. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/c4/9c/c49c927fc706c39fc129becbf5c1b8de.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <strong>Cried Mommy cum ...</strong> <br>  <em><i>Photo from <a href="https://lori.ru/">Lori's photobank</a> .</i></em> <em><br></em> <br><a name="habracut"></a><habracut><br>  And at the existing speeds of technology development, I would not be surprised if we see only an ordinary book in a couple of decades in the museum, they will be almost the same rarity as the books of the first printers. <br>  Every day there are interesting new items in the world of digital technology.  Yesterday the news on TV (of course, due to the absence of the TV, as the next "dinosaur", spy on the computer) was an interesting story.  In one of the Moscow schools in the class appeared an interesting student, together with the children from September 1, the robot goes to the lessons. <br>  He answers the teacher's questions and even goes out with his friends for a break.  And all this is already customary for teachers and children in this school.  The guys just lament that they cannot invite their friend to the cinema or on a tour.  But experts, whose brainchild is Electronic, say that soon everything will be possible. <br>  What kind of robot is this? Why does he attend this particular class?  It turns out that a young Muscovite who has recently undergone an operation that has a serious illness, but a very stubborn character, who does not want to give up the disease, but lives and fights.  Exactly he controls this Electronics, being at home in front of a computer monitor.  He participates in the experimental development of such devices, testing his work and telling about various software and technical bugs.  In turn, the developers promise that soon such robots will appear not only in schools, but also in libraries, concert halls, theaters and circuses.  Well and further, on what the imagination suffices. <br>  <a href="https://www.1tv.ru/news/techno/171514">link to the plot</a> <br>  But back to "our donuts."  It turns out that our work of wizards engaged in recovering information on various media will always be one of the most sought after.  And our desire to protect you from various incidents that can happen to you if you are not sufficiently responsible for data storage is justified. <br>  If today we are talking about children, then the case today will be ‚Äúchildish.‚Äù  Our children are already hurrying to the computer from the cradle, but now we‚Äôre not talking about the dangers of the computer to the fragile child‚Äôs psyche, we‚Äôre now talking about the dangers caused by small barbarians of insufficiently strong (not armored) computer equipment. <br><br>  They brought us a laptop with such a background.  The young mother wrote her diploma, everything was almost ready, but her baby, while she was away to the kitchen, got a job at the table and began to ‚Äúplay‚Äù, pressing all the keys in a row.  A great pianist may turn out to be a baby, maybe he will become a new Denis Matsuev, but my mother‚Äôs poor diploma ... The hard disk flew, we could not help the service center, our specialists are trying to save the work of the young mother, maybe they will succeed. <br>  Everything as usual.  Copies we do not need.
