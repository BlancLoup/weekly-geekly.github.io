What should be done and what should not be done in order for the work to be done efficiently and on time? <br><br>  A normally constructed system of relations between a manager and a subordinate is based on the intellectual superiority of the manager and his ability to predict and prioritize not without regard for the interests of the contractor, which is very important.  If this is not the case, and the girl manager plays the role of the employer, and the maniac programmer plays the role of the performer, the manager will not receive the results, and the programmer will receive no money. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><br><h2>  1. Clearly assigned task. </h2><br>  A good leader is a sieve that is able to weed out the trash and skip the most important details to the performer.  Thus, if a manager cannot formulate a task, then the executor will not do it all the more.

    <h6>  Bad task: </h6><br>  - There is something wrong with the main page. <br>  <i>I myself do not understand something, you yourself think, yeah.</i> <br>  - We still need to fix this, but it‚Äôs not clear yet exactly, so you don‚Äôt do it yet, just think, maybe some thoughts will appear. <br>  <i>Such tasks loop the performer, he will return to them again and again, but he will not do anything, having spent a lot of time.</i>  <i>Set a task only after you are convinced of its relevance.</i> <br><br><h6>  An example of a good task: </h6><br>  - On the page ‚Äúabout the company‚Äù it is necessary to make the headings not so pale. <br>  - On the services page, the price list should be sorted by cost, not alphabetically. <br><br><br><br><h2>  2. A clearly defined time for its implementation. </h2><br>  The more precisely the time limits of the task are determined, the easier it is to perform.  It is easier.  I myself often lazy when the task is ‚Äúnon-urgent‚Äù, all the time it is pushed aside by more urgent / interesting matters. <br><br><h6>  An example of a poorly assigned task: </h6><br>  - It is necessary to correct this and this.  As time will make. <br>  <i>I can't decide for you when you do this, so decide yourself somehow.</i>  <i>Will not solve.</i>  <i>The result you will beat out.</i> <br><br><h6>  An example of a good task: </h6><br>  - We need to make it to the environment. <br>  <i>You are the leader, and therefore you have the right to demand results from the performer.</i>  <i>You are a manager, and therefore you can plan the work of the performer and set a real term.</i> <br>  Another good thing is to give the performer his own term.  But he should voice it: <br>  - We have to do this.  When you can?  - tomorrow by noon.  - OK. <br>  <i>This approach develops a sense of responsibility in the performer, which is very good.</i> <br><br><br><br><h2>  3. Linearity of the problem </h2><br>  Each task must be ‚Äúcrossed out‚Äù upon completion.  If this does not happen, then the contractor will hang a dead weight, making it difficult to work further.  That is, the task should not branch. <br><br><h6>  Nonlinear problem: </h6><br>  - to draw the section "production". <br>  <i>This section is likely to consist of many subsections, and instead of one unit, the designer will draw several, while tugging at the same time the head, demanding new input from him.</i> <br><br><h6>  It would be nice if the manager himself thought and divided this task into linear sections: </h6><br>  - For the ‚Äúproduction‚Äù section, it is necessary to draw templates: 1. General, consisting of such subsections.  2. The subsection page, it should be this and that.  3. Product page - name, picture, description. <br>  <i>In this case, each template is an independent task, which can be crossed out with a clear conscience after it has been submitted.</i> <br>  This problem disappears if an experienced interface designer acts as a manager :) <br><br><br><br><h2>  4. Fat point </h2><br>  Very straining tasks that seem to be handed over, but at the same time, "everything is OK, if anything, then we will correct it."  The sentence after the comma is unnecessary information for the artist.  It is important for him to accept or reject the results of work.  Everything else is the leader's lyrics, a manifestation of his incompetence. <br><br>  And most importantly: do not promote free relations between the leader and subordinates, such as all are equal.  This is the worst mistake that both parties suffer from. <br>  In ancient India, there was a clear hierarchy of society: the lowest layer was the workers and peasants;  these people can not control anyone except themselves, and then with difficulty, they only drank and walked, they should be forced to work <i>(look at the Gopniks)</i> , so they were controlled by the next stratum of the population - traders, they thought for themselves and for the peasants <i>(you need? Then stop drinking vodka, march to work)</i> ;  over the merchants stood the kings, they thought and made decisions for themselves and for the lower two layers;  and over the kings were the brahmans and wise men who suggested how to act.  And each higher layer treated the lower layer, as fathers treat children.  With love.  And this structure is very correct <i>(on the topic of why this is so, you can write another article)</i> .  It is this relationship that must be between the supervisor and the subordinate.  The head father thinks with love and decides for his not-yet-experienced child performer.  And you will be happy in business :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/58889/">https://habr.com/ru/post/58889/</a></p>
