      The labor market in the Russian Federation as a whole. <br>  The labor market in IT in Moscow for 10 years - from the pre-crisis 2007 to autumn 2008 and now. <br>  Salaries in the technical part. <br>  New interesting approaches to hiring by example. <br><br>  <b>HR</b> <br><br>  Problems in the IT market in Moscow in general, the quality of staff. <br>  Problems in the IT market in Moscow in the lower link (eniky). <br>  Problems in the IT market in Moscow in the middle tier (advanced eniky - junior admin). <br>  Problems in the IT market in Moscow at senior level (leading experts). <br>  Problems in the IT market in Moscow in hiring (HR). <br>  Problems in the IT market in Moscow at the senior level. <br><br>  <b>Typical problems admins</b> <br><br>  Admins and Accounting. <br>  Admins and Sales / PM / RP. <br>  Admins and attempt to enter the international market. <br><br>  <b>General economic</b> <br><br>  <i>V. Putin at a meeting with the parliamentary faction of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation stated that ‚Äútrust in the United States as the leader of a free world and a free economy, trust in Wall Street as the center of this trust is undermined, I believe, forever.</i>  <i>There will be no return to the previous situation. "</i> <br><br>  <b>Labor market in the Russian Federation as a whole</b> <br><br>  The labor market in Russia as a whole is very interesting.  On the one hand, the Russian Federation still knows how to make rockets, cutlets, ballets, block the Yenisei, and even civilian planes are quite good for themselves (only very expensive ones, especially in operation, even on credit on the World map).  Micron makes microcircuits on an <s>old Indian from a cemetery</s> with AMD steppers, this is of course not Rizen and not 1080, but it seems to be enough to deliver <i>minority cones entering the dense layers of the atmosphere along a ballistic trajectory</i> .  I do not want to check. <br><br>  On the other hand, the average (median is not published) salary in the Russian Federation is 20-25 thousand rubles, and the human resources market by 2/3 (maybe more) is represented by government agencies, the budget, the army, the police, tax and other FSUE options. <br><br>  On the third hand, for the Russian Federation, cronyism, cronyism, and the appointment and promotion of the children of whom it is necessary and just the boys from a good family to leading posts, are too often manifested.  Not that this is good or bad, but it leads to a strong bias in wages and prospects in the direction of "the simple guy has not very many prospects."  To this I will be back later. <br><br>  Now some things that I propose to accept without evidence, or to prove independently. <br><br>  1. In the village of Gadyukino no admins with VCAP (The VMware Certified Advanced Professional) are needed - there is no such work.  In the district center, 20 kilometers from Gadyukino, the situation is the same.  Is that the village council has 1C and the Internet.  Now, if some comrades with VCAP bar opened (there, or where it is warmer) - that would be a completely different matter.  In the district center of thousands per 50 population, the situation is similar. <br><br>  2. In the regional center of thousands, as many as 300-500 people have a better situation.  True, there most often IT lives in a very limited number of places - an old (or renovated) factory, sometimes two.  The local administration and the local representative office of Rostelecom plus the big cellular three (or two, is MTS Rosneft already or not?).  In the Railways, suddenly.  Maybe a little more in the local oil / gas / refining, traffic police and police.  Regional branches of banks, especially green. <br><br>  Division of securities.  Tax.  Pension Fund ... slightly.  Maybe the franchisee 1c and consultant (and then another question - where is the IT).  Everything.  The rest of the business is represented by various kinds of buy-sell shops, which are not much different from the village council - except that 1C will not be a file, but SQL.  Best case scenario.  Well, yes, maybe there will be some domain in such an organization - purely so that it was.  Small business - up to 200 people and up to 3 divisions in the city.  Up to some McDuck on outsourcing. <br><br>  3. Serious IT, medium and large business - from, conditionally, 500 hosts / jobs *.  - actually placed in the Russian Federation: <br><br><ul><li>  in the European part - Moscow, St. Petersburg, Nizhny Novgorod.  Little Kazan and Rostov on Don; </li><li>  in Siberia - Novosibirsk, probably, Yekaterinburg (the same Nag).  Suddenly Perm (especially Perm engines and Aircraft engines); </li><li>  the rest ... yes, there is something.  The question is what and how much.  And what scale.  There are, of course, sensible developers in Siberia - Denis Popov, Alexey Babushkin.  Hears about the work of the whole institute of something leading (not in Siberia). </li></ul><br>  Of course there are other exceptions, but nevertheless - large IT is located in large cities. ** <br><br>  4. Of course, there are separate areas of activity - these are large stores (retail), these are modern automated process control systems, which are just the opposite - they exist in large quantities outside Moscow, but this is a little different.  Although the groans about the lack of personnel in the regions in the retail, I hear quite often.  What is not surprising, as will be seen below. <br><br>  * Although it may be that there are only 100 workplaces, 50 of them are development, and the entire production is moved to a data center, or is it a general communications center of a local provider. <br><br>  ** What a discovery. <br><br>  There is exactly one conclusion from here: you want to develop as an IT specialist (of course, with salary growth) - move to a larger city.  You do not want to move and develop - see the <a href="http://www.beerpanda.ru/%3Fp%3D164">famous article ‚ÄúI would be glad, but ...</a> ‚Äù - this is your personal choice.  Please note that you will soon (or already) run into the ceiling of applicability of technologies in the region / city - simply put, Vector LLC does not need dynamic UPS and Vxlan (RFC 7348) / NVGRE (RFC 7637) or any other Vmware FT.  Heavy mezhdelmash is also not that there is, rather not (although it may be - in the same air and engine, <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2590%25D0%259B-100">for example the AL-100 in Rybinsk</a> ). <br><br>  The reverse side of the problem is personnel.  The majority of personnel with knowledge and motivation for development are leaving the regions.  In one of the past works for 6 people in the department I had 2 (two) from Moscow.  The rest - Tambov, Saratov, Yaroslavl, and it seems, Novosibirsk.  I‚Äôm generally silent about Moscow‚Äôs neighboring regions, Tula, Ryazan, and from there, in my opinion, everyone who wanted a little bit left for Moscow.  Frames remain, let's say, not very interested.  Of course, again, there are exceptions, up to a certain level it is possible to grow in the region, for example, local telecom.  There are already those who have already returned, who for some reason did not take off in Moscow, but they did not have the strength to try again. <br><br>  The third side of the problem, or its edge, is hackers of all kinds.  When you have no chances for a good place and salary in principle, you don‚Äôt take the army or the police according to competition * or health, you don‚Äôt want to work for the only city-forming enterprise for all the same 20-25 thousand, and there‚Äôs not a bad education (rather self-education) and access to the Internet - the prospect is quite interesting.  Many are caught.  Many do not immediately.  The smartest are caught and sent to work where necessary, which is also a good prospect for a guy from the provinces. <br><br>  Moreover, evil tongues spread rumors that Fancy Bear is generally military unit 26165 / X, sitting in the Moscow region, with excellent technical equipment, personnel and so on.  They definitely lie, but if it were so, then it‚Äôs also a good career for guys from the provinces. <br><br>  The farther in time, the more the situation resembles a joke from the USSR, whether the son of a colonel can become a general, and the further the labor market is divided into three large and unrelated groups (as in the USSR) - for ordinary citizens, for whom children need, and labor market in power structures of all kinds. <br><br>  * The competition for admission to individual faculties and to individual universities is another topic.  Moreover, within the framework of even one university, for example, the city of E-R-ska, there may be very, very different conditions for different faculties.  Officially, of course, everyone is equal, but <i>evil small languages</i> slander and blacken. <br><br>  Often there are really no prospects - either the remnants of the ‚Äú100 years without a crop‚Äù collective farm, or the same factory or army.  And in the army you have to ask for combat, otherwise there is also not very interesting in terms of money.  Although there is a military mortgage, and much more.  Now.  Not so long ago. <br><br>  Note: of course, it depends on additional payments for everything, for additional skills.  In a good regiment, even without combat, the SNP of a sergeant level (from the October town, EVPICHYA) is about 35-40 thousand. <br><br>  Based on all three points (no work / no prospects / there is a very gray sector) - there is a problem of finding quality personnel in the regions.  The closer to Moscow, the more often the staff leaves for Moscow. <br><br>  <b>The labor market in IT in Moscow for 10 years - from the pre-crisis 2007 to autumn 2008 and now.</b>  <b>Salaries in the technical part.</b>  <b>New interesting approaches to hiring by example.</b> <br><br>  Further arguments will go about personnel problems in Moscow.  With a certain reduction factor, they can be applied to the regions, and even to St. Petersburg. <br><br>  On the wave of oil for a hundred or even two hundred per barrel - the market and labor and IT grew from 2002 to 2008 at a tremendous rate.  Such a number and quality of cloud services has not yet been, outsourcing was unpopular, so IT specialists were needed everywhere and a lot.  Such a number of personnel simply did not exist, and wages grew faster than the market.  In Moscow, wages grew even faster, and cadres came from everywhere.  For the summer of 2007, with an average salary in the region of 10 thousand rubles - the lower level of rates (for IT and in general) in Moscow was 25 tr, and the average in the region of 50-70 tr.  With a dollar of 23-25 ‚Äã‚Äã(as of August 1, 2008, the dollar rate of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation was 23.42) it was almost 2 thousand - 120 tr. To the current account. <br><br>  Then came the fall of 2008.  Not everything was closed, but too much.  The lower level almost did not subside, enikei were needed, but the upper and middle levels squeezed down, from 70 to 35-40. <br><br>  Starting from 2011 - 2012, the market went up again (it would seem, and where the oil is), but in 2014 what happened happened and the growth of salaries (especially from November-December 2014 and the delivery of the dollar to the ‚Äúone hundred‚Äù store) again stopped . <br><br>  Current personnel problems in IT (in Moscow) are growing from several sides.  On the one hand, the money in the economy has become much less than in 2002-2008.  But our Crimea.  On the other hand, the technological entry threshold has dropped sharply.  Server equipment has fallen in price, network has fallen in price.  Setting up network equipment is simplified, gigabit (and even 10G) networks and SSD drives are everywhere.  Debugged mass software installation method further on.  Raising the domain on the 2016 server is a task (just raising) for half an hour, virtual machines on it are another hour.  And everything will work.  And even in the Hyper-V configuration on the domain controller (and TMG in the same place).  True, then tech and sometimes LJ will be filled with moans of the form "I shook further and further, but it did not work." <br><br>  Examples (will be lower again, but let them be here): <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/ru-RU/ad146384-dbd9-4574-856c-71b93ca3c2df/-smb%3Fforum%3Dotherservru">Time</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/ru-RU/41e0e11a-157f-4480-a0c7-68582efccece/-exchange-server-2016-5%3Fforum%3DExchangeServer2016%26ranMID%3D24542%26ranEAID%3DTnL5HPStwNw%26ranSiteID%3DTnL5HPStwNw-TI1aXeCKTXoviSFjtL1KKA%26tduid%3D(7e8fcab502c43f7cd7303f54d368e6ba)(256380)(2459594)(TnL5HPStwNw-TI1aXeCKTXoviSFjtL1KKA)()">Two</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/ru-RU/6ff3e207-64a2-4204-b5d7-073c0c84c760/-active-directory-%3Fforum%3Druwinserver2016">Three</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/ru-RU/0c2a9625-45cf-46c0-a92d-6dee43740593/-%3Fforum%3Dws2008r2ru">Four</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/ru-RU/2f46beec-14c1-4ced-8fdd-3377dd978332/-pop3-exchange%3Fforum%3Dexchange2013ru">Five</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/ru-RU/841b793b-a741-482c-8b76-fb0d9cf894ff/-exchange-2016-windows-server-2012-r2%3Fforum%3DWS8ru">Six</a> </li></ul><br>  Operator <a href="https://fromreallife.wordpress.com/">guidance on the beautiful</a> . <br><br>  On the third hand, the <i>further-next-earned</i> method leads to the fact that there can be 100 domain administrators in the organization and not a single backup.  But on the domain controller (physical, one piece) there is a top-end video card, and the other three servers produce bitcoins a little.  Or broadcast.  And even <i>in one large company.</i>  <i>Damn hackers!</i> <br><br>  On the fourth, there are hundreds of courses on the network ‚Äúhow to choose a system administrator by the sign of the zodiac, the <i>shape of the ears, etc.</i> ‚Äù.  The same number of courses about the development of personnel motivation systems, improving efficiency ( <i>It is known that a cow should eat less and give more milk should be milked more often and less often fed</i> ), these like stress interviews and so on. <br><br>  For system administrators, there are courses with beautiful papers for resumes, about listening to courses about something there.  Plus the courses ‚Äúhow to get past HR to people?  decision makers. " <br><br>  Salaries in the technical part. <br><br>  Plate 01 <br>  The labor market and jobs in Moscow for the summer of 2017 can be represented in the form of a tablet. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/613/4f8/567/6134f8567e424dfdb4c7afa77463ccd6.gif"><br><br>  * Often need intermediate level of spoken English.  Approximately 4.5-5 points on IELTS.  The higher the position - the higher the required level, up to the upper. <br><br>  ** In June 2017, one small campaign in Krylatskoye was looking for the Premium Support Engineer for a salary of ‚Äúup to 150 before deduction‚Äù, which amounts to 130 tr.  "On hand".  Evil tongues say that generally we are talking about 110-120. <br><br>  The number of jobs (sample for headhunter for one and a half years) in Moscow will be approximately as follows: the first figure is the minimum number of vacancies with published salaries for a year and a half, the second is the current ‚Äúfor now‚Äù.  (There could be a sign here, but I'm lazy) <br><br><ul><li>  Enikey (40R) - 100/180 </li><li>  Junior admin (60R) - 50/120 </li><li>  System Administrator (90R) - 20/50 </li><li>  Lead / Experienced System Administrator (110R +) </li></ul><br>  Open positions are practically not published.  Or without specifying a salary, or for a long time looking for "from ambush."  About the reasons, as I understand them, also later. <br><br>  The real number of vacancies roughly corresponds to these figures, but.  There are a few but. <br><br>  1. Some vacancies are simply not published, for example, 100+ jobs.  Or published without specifying wages. <br><br>  2. A part of vacancies is all the same ‚Äúwe want an eight-armed seven-eyed and that everything was able‚Äù.  There are eight-armed seven-eyes, and for a year they can look for an employee for such a place.  Just because such people (as employers want) or not at all, or not for such money. <br><br>  3. Some vacancies are simply duplicated.  Seen the vacancies taken by HR by copy-paste method from the original vacancy. <br><br>  As <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/331558/">for the previously mentioned - where AntonVirtual writes:</a> <br><br>  <i>At the moment, there is an acute shortage of qualified personnel in Moscow.</i>  <i>Verified</i>  <i>In general, I observe a significant amount, i.e.</i>  <i>over 100 open positions per 100+.</i>  <i>He personally helped to find people for 150+.</i>  <i>There are no people, there is money and vacancies.</i> <br>  - Here the situation is a bit more complicated. <br>  Yes, probably in total, for the quarter, not closed non-public vacancies in Moscow, 100+ will have a hundred pieces.  The question is that they often have requirements for, conditionally, 150+, and vacancies are not public.  150+ in the sense that from this position a person went to 150+, and the conditional 100+ is when it was 80 years old, then it became 110. What will be there at such places - at the very end. <br><br>  New interesting approaches to hiring by example. <br><br>  Recently there was a great article - <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/331276/">"Antipatterns to search for applicants</a> . <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/331276/">"</a>  In addition to this <br>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/169949/">Interview for junior position.</a>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/169949/">Antipatery interviewers</a> . <br><br>  Almost everything that has been said and supplemented in the comments is valid not only for development, but for the whole IT as well.  Yes, HR agencies and girls from cadres are such a very separate and very funny topic, but they will be discussed below and separately. <br><br>  An attempt to say that not all Eychary are such - This <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/pm/blog/334268/">one</a> , and <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/404HUB/blog/291810/">this one</a> , and <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/appodeal/blog/331666/">this one</a> <br>  - not very successful.  Well, yes, not all.  But they are. <br><br>  Of particular note is the fresh discrepancy between the position of HR in matters of photo / no photo. <br>  Here is an opinion on the reasons for this discrepancy. <br><br>  And here <a href="https://www.yaplakal.com/forum7/topic948137.html">there</a> is a cold epic about what HR can do for hiring.  It seems to me this epic. <br><br>  There are not very many particularly bright representatives (from, it seems, EPAM), with their blacklists, but we have them.  By the way, here are the blacklists: <br><ul><li>  Read <a href="https://ebanoe.it/2016/07/29/it-hr-sect/">times</a> </li><li>  Read <a href="https://ebanoe.it/2016/07/22/epam-hr-fail/">two</a> </li></ul><br>  However, the hiring policy ‚Äúas a whole‚Äù is not determined by them, it is not they who decide who to look for, for what requirements and with what salary, the problem of management personnel and the economic situation manifests itself here.  From here all the listed and really meeting things in vacancies grows. <br><ul><li>  Not an indication of salaries.  Or an indication to / from.  Or indication gross (before deduction NDFL).  Or an indication taking into account the award with the maximum available KPI.  Or with an annual premium.  Or something else that pops up only after an interview. </li><li>  Search for a specialist with tasks for three.  Plus with the requirement of 24/7/365.  And so on in the text and comments. </li></ul><br>  Of those not mentioned in typical anti-patterns (or I didn‚Äôt finish reading) - the approach is ‚Äúa crisis, rejoice at least for such work‚Äù.  But no - the situation of the current crisis is different from the crisis of 2008, and for the worse for everyone, both for employers and employees. <br><br>  The second is not less, and perhaps more interesting article from the recent - <br>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/331558/">Whether to limit users on resources?</a>  she <br><br>  It is interesting discussion in the comments on Habr√©, in the style of "but the author has a big and thick enterprise, and we are little black birds in a small town and there is no work here" - which describes the real situation well from the point of view of junior managers.  The situation is not surprising, something else is surprising - how easy it became for people to write about the fact that they are not guilty and are ready to put the responsibility on anything and anyone but themselves.  Maybe I am a starper, but such an approach is some kind of infantilism, so after all, it can also wind up onto a spinner.  But there is no statistics, maybe it was before, I just did not notice, and for me this approach looks like a new one. <br><br>  But on the other hand, sometimes the obvious type of "do not sink below a certain level" and other tips from the obvious (as it is) should probably be repeated to everyone from time to time. <br><br>  <b>Of the examples of excellent work of leadership and not only personnel - the whole bunch.</b>  <b>Including HR</b> <br><br>  Cat with a lamp <br><br>  Given: office AAA LLC, new tender for support.  Won some kind of newly formed company, which failed to N million rubles compared to the rest.  SUDDENLY it turns out that they fit into the tender, but there are no people at all - the traffic attendants and admins. <br>  They put some citizens on dial-ups who dial up to people who used to turn these nuts.  They offer "go right now, the details later."  When the fun comes to the details - because the person who twists the cook for 50 + hosts, the tsitriksoid and generally the excellent guy is offered - 35k.  Rubles.  Per month.  In Moscow.  In 2016. <br><br>  <b>Personnel.</b> <br><ul><li>  Problems in the IT market in Moscow in general, the quality of staff. </li><li>  Problems in the IT market in Moscow in the lower link (eniky). </li><li>  Problems in the IT market in Moscow in the middle tier (advanced eniky - junior admin). </li><li>  Problems in the IT market in Moscow at senior level (leading experts). </li><li>  Problems in the IT market in Moscow in hiring (HR). </li><li>  Problems in the IT market in Moscow at the senior level. </li></ul><br>  First you need to decide on the terms. <br><br>  <b>Enikay</b> <br><br>  He is not able to do anything except work that requires a minimum of IT knowledge.  This is a cable pulling in place, cable ringing, the ability to dial ipconfig and dictate numbers by phone.  Plus the ability to read instructions on standard situations / STC and act on it.  Cartridges, jammed paper, connecting to Wifi, setting up mail is about that level.  Windu can also rearrange, and even set up a router with Wi-Fi.  But at the same time Eniky does not understand why the rights to public folders are different, and what does NTFS have to do with it. <br><br>  <a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/ru-RU/ad146384-dbd9-4574-856c-71b93ca3c2df/-smb%3Fforum%3Dotherservru">Example 01</a> <br><br>  It happens worse when such an employee is trusted with the main steering wheel. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/639/072/526/6390725267164e1889e54e3f7be4749b.jpg"><br><br>  Then it happens <a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/ru-RU/41e0e11a-157f-4480-a0c7-68582efccece/-exchange-server-2016-5%3Fforum%3DExchangeServer2016%26ranMID%3D24542%26ranEAID%3DTnL5HPStwNw%26ranSiteID%3DTnL5HPStwNw-TI1aXeCKTXoviSFjtL1KKA%26tduid%3D(7e8fcab502c43f7cd7303f54d368e6ba)(256380)(2459594)(TnL5HPStwNw-TI1aXeCKTXoviSFjtL1KKA)()">so</a> , Or <a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/ru-RU/6ff3e207-64a2-4204-b5d7-073c0c84c760/-active-directory-%3Fforum%3Druwinserver2016">so</a> <br><br>  <b>Junior admin / advanced eniky</b> <br><br>  In addition to the above, it is able to create users in AD a little bit, it can do a little (ICND1) networks, very little Exchange 2007/2010/2013 (for example, connectors do not know how).  Maybe even heard about archiving, and maybe even started powershell.  Twice.  And put Ubuntu at home. <br><br>  <b>Lead System Administrator</b> <br><br>  Such a long job title, IMHO, grows from the USSR with a specialist system \ leading specialist \ someone else there.  In fact, there could be anyone here, but in this case it is still a universal specialist who is equally bad at networking (ICND2), somewhere in the middle <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/mcsa-windows-server-certification.aspx">of the MCSA track: Windows Server 2012 (- 70-410 / 70-411 / 70-412)</a> , or <a href="">MCSA</a> track <a href="">: Windows Server 2016 2016 - 70-740 / 70-741 / 70-742.</a>  <a href="https://mylearn.vmware.com/portals/certification/">VCP</a> bonus. <br><br>  The key point here is the presence of actually passed exams via Person VUE.  The knowledge of FC comes as a bonus (we say FC - we mean Brocade, although Cisco has it - Cisco MDS 9148 Multilayer Fabric Switch, and QLogic - SB3810-08A, SB5800V-08A, but you must start all the same with <a href="http://www.brocade.com/en/education/courses/introduction-to-fibre-channel-concepts.html">FC 101-WBT Introduction to Fiber Channel Concepts</a> - Zoning, that's all.).  In bulk - Juniper, HPE, Kaspersky, Veeam VMCE - Veeam Certified Engineer, and so on.  Sometimes there is also telephony - Asterisk, and even every little thing for the 3rd group of electrical safety, which I mentioned here. <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/333910/">When I come to work, I take matters, update, document, audit</a> and here are <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/334370/">the small office engineering systems and questions for them ( and not the check itself</a> .  After this level of ‚Äúknowledge for just a little bit‚Äù, a large adult IT begins.  The main thing is not to confuse a specialist with a specialist level of ‚Äúonly MVP and some more psychologist.‚Äù * <br><br>  * If you know what this joke is about, of course. <br><br>  Recently, three separate areas have appeared.  The first is Configuration as code.  If anyone does not know, this is where Terraform, Consul, Serf, Vault, Vagrant / Otto.  Or where Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, OpenShift.  And in some places terrible blue whale with an octopus. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/789/7c6/7c2/7897c67c29c84c0a8c9ed8d24fff03ef.jpg"><br><br>  The second is where TOGAF, CISSP-ISSAP, SABSA and other scary words. <br><br>  The third is where words are even worse, SDN / SDS, Vxlan / nvgre / stt / and even network namespaces / Windows Container Networking.  There, in both cases, your own world.  Interesting, but yours. <br><br>  <b>Problems in the IT market in Moscow in the lower link (eniky)</b> <br><br>  The problem with the staff of this link is.  This is, first of all, a mixture of arrogance, dementia and courage.  Plus is a keen dislike for reading and self-development.  It is from such characters in a long-erased sweater, with red eyes and love for strange words, stories about onjaaytnegnegov and onzheprogrammers.  The problem is that these employees work on the first line and personally communicate with users. <br><br>  Situation: the enikeev is sane in full, they work and develop to junior administrators ( <i>if, of course, they do not mine, EEPOCHA</i> ), but there are also problem personnel.  It is good if a person is interested in such a job (for his own reasons), it is bad if he is not interested in him, if he wants to get, and not to earn *.  Often the presence of such frames, black sheep, is more likely a symptom of another disease, with leading cadres. <br><br>  * Direct quote from the speech of one candidate. <br><br>  <b>Problems in the IT market in Moscow in the middle tier (advanced eniky - junior admin)</b> <br><br>  Suddenly, I didn‚Äôt see any problems with frames in this link.  Perhaps because this is a transitional level, when a person is still developing, but he has not yet managed to gain self-importance as a specialist in installing Windows and assembling PCs from spare parts from the market.  But they don‚Äôt have any fear of fakap, as well as the experience of laying straw everywhere.  Generally, absolutely everywhere.  For example, experience planning the best, usual, and worst outcomes.  Or useful practice to test ideas of modernization in the laboratory network and laboratory equipment. <br><br>  Interesting, but true.  Now a stand for a laboratory under Vmware can be assembled for forty (40) thousand rubles, considered the configuration in June.  But too much is expensive, even in Moscow. <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There is another difficulty for personnel (HR) and management - how not to confuse the junior system administrator with enikey and both of them with the MVP / psychologist. Everyone knows the different magic words, only the approach to IT is different. The separation marker is a pattern of behavior. Search-and-read against immediately-ask-decision-un-reading. </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Problems in the IT market in Moscow at senior level (leading experts)</font></font></b> <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> In my opinion, this is the most problematic contingent of all, especially for HR *. The fact is that there are relatively few of them, they know this and are not at all nervous about work and possible dismissal. But their managers have to be nervous - unless, of course, the organization is doing well with the heads of IT departments and CIOs, but this is just not the case.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Some irresponsible personalities from such generally take it like that, and steal a tractor. How can such people in general be trusted, where are those old cadres that sing songs about the factory gates, that they brought people into ...? Separately, you can write stories, as a conditional architect tried to live through a girl from HR. Type "you have a bad psychological test." </font></font><br><br> <i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">* Exception - if a specialist is married to HR. I heard several publicly voiced awesome stories of such a plan.</font></font></i> <br><br>  Interesting fact.       ¬´¬ª.  /    ‚Äì  50/1.           .  1,  ,   ,      ‚Äì  .             (   ) ,    .    ,     ( )    ,        , ?  ,       ,     ? <br><br>      ‚Äì <br> <a href="http://david-2.livejournal.com/451423.html">¬´    ¬ª ‚Äî  I</a> <br> <a href="http://david-2.livejournal.com/451797.html">¬´    ¬ª ‚Äî  II</a> <br><br> <b>       (HR)</b> <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The first problem of personnel and recruitment agencies that I encountered is the self-conceit of HR employees. Sovereigns of fate, with pattern tests and the expectation of pattern answers. How do you see yourself in our campaign in five years. Name three of your three good qualities. What do you know about our LLC Vector, its market share, mission and corporate values? </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is a great honor to work in our bank, that's all.</font></font><br><br>   ,    ?    ,   ARM  ?  ?      ? ?   ?    ,      . ,     ( ) ‚Äì      DNIWE,     HR.   ,      ,   - , 20--- ,       . <br><br>  ,     ‚Äì (!)  .        ,     . <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The second problem is work on the process, not on the result. In the sense that they work, as if the contract was made to search for 10 any employees, and not 1 necessary. As a result, the swing begins ‚Äúyou first come to talk to us, and then we will give you, if you like, say about money, and about work. At least the name of the company. Sometimes, of course, it is interesting to go, and sometimes it may get lucky. And sometimes it turns out that everything that is written in a published vacancy is a lie. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Interestingly, very few personnel agencies use e-mail for something other than sending the address of the interview, sometimes they cannot even write a salary plug, even after a direct question.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There will be no withdrawal, except for the self-evident - if you are still at the first interview refuse to name the salary fork, but they start talking about a friendly team and a great honor - run, fools. </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Problems in the IT market in Moscow at the top level There are</font></font></b> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> problems, and there are very different problems. Writing about "all is well" is not interesting. About AA ALL BAD - much more fun. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Problem 1. Old / experienced / proven frames. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Problem 2. Children of good parents - boys from a good family, and others given by the hand. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Problem 3. I am the boss, and you are all fools, you have always done this and in general you have been eating, since today everything will be mine. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Problem 4. Business requirements. </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Problem 1. Old / experienced / proven frames</font></font></b> <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Simplifying, this is what used to be called "nomenclature". Although why earlier? The situation has not changed so much. These are already elderly (50+), employees who have seen life, who can work even as an IT director, even as a deputy for personnel, even as head of the transport department. In general, working with such frames is not so bad, but you need to choose the right approach. Often the approach is bureaucratic, but sometimes it is not so bad - you will learn to count the budget and justify your Wishlist, at the same time understand the benefits of some purchases for the business itself. The normal subtype of such chiefs - I do not care what you do, I glue the airplanes here, and I have 3 years left to work, so do not break anything. </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Problem 2. Children of good parents - boys from a good family, and others given by the hand</font></font></b> <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The second for the level of "bad" option (the first - below). This problem, but so far (although where, how) is not in a management team - rather, this boy (or girl) will be brought to the department and they say, "here is the son of a good man, look at his level of victories!"</font></font> Well yes.  ,  .     ,    .  ‚Äì  . <br>    ‚Äì    .    ,      ,    (   ) ‚Äì   ,    (  ,  .     ). <br>  ,  ,  . <br><br>         ‚Äì    DNIWE. <br>       ‚Äì 146 %. <br><br> <b> 3.  ,    ,       ,      </b> <br><br><blockquote> <i>     .  : <br> ‚Äî ,    ? <br> ‚Äî   ‚Äî . <br>    . <br> ‚Äî , . <br> -   ,  ,  ? <br> ‚Äî   ! <br> ‚Äî  ,      !</i> </blockquote><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I started this fragment several times and erased it - all the time it was garbage. Well, yes, there are that the heads in life are not very good people. But if you are so clever (and they are so intuitive) - If you're so smart, why are you not rich? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But the question is not quite about it (although about it too). The question is whether they are bad ( </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">but reliable. Or unreliable, but necessary</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> ) leaders in terms of </font></font><u><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">management</font></font></u><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . Or, the ‚Äúgeneral plan‚Äù tasks set (by the general director) are carried out at a reasonable price (total cost of personnel - wage bill, plus cost of ownership) and within a reasonable time, and you have problems with not understanding the real methods and tasks of management.</font></font><br><br> ,        (  ‚Äî ),   ,      ,   . ,  / ‚Äî    ,  (  ,     ,     )     .   ,     ()  4   40 ,    ,     ,     8*5   .           , .     . <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, bad leadership is a problem that comes across too often. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It doesn‚Äôt matter why it happened, the real solution is one thing - a statement of your own free will on the table. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Although you can chew snot and try to convince yourself that time is difficult, it is too late to study, there is no other work, everything. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It's easier for me - I know about a manager who had a diploma for the right to control the </font></font><a href="http://www.airwar.ru/enc/other/yak52.html"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Yak-52</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> in his office </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He got it at age 65 - it's a bit late to study, right? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Typical markers of such a problem manager:</font></font><br><br><ul><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Why do we need more engineers, these are underutilized! </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> This is not our area of ‚Äã‚Äãresponsibility. </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> At the meeting, I raised the question of .., and I was assured of ... </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Misha is a little impudent, let's fire him and take a student for half of his sn. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Cost optimization. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I'll write myself a premium</font></font></li><li>    !

One solution is to complete my education (if you knew what you were going for, but experience and a line in your resume are more necessary) and a statement on the table.  Trying to agree on what is regularly written in tons of bullshit on personal growth is useless.  Although you can try, suddenly succeed. <br><br>  <b>Problem 4. Business Requirements</b> <br>  She - Admins and guide. <br>  The easiest thing to do here is to refer to a good book - Terry White.  What the business really wants from IT, or for a good article, is Management vs Sysadmin.  Links will not google themselves. <br><br>  <b>Typical problems admins.</b> <br>  Admins and Accounting. <br>  Admins and Sales / PM / RP. <br>  Admins and users. <br>  Admins and international market. <br><br>  <b>Admins and Accounting</b> <br>  The accounting department does not like to admit that it is the source of the problem, in the classic form ‚ÄúI did not press anything‚Äù.  Solution: software restriction policies + allocated VLAN + PVLAN + other segmentation and restrictions.  So that the accounting machines (and especially the bank clients) did not work with anything but KLADR, 1c and a couple of sites.  We need Internet and other joys - a separate PC, in order to occupy less space - KVM. <br>  Accounting is not very fond of writing off all the old stuff.  Previously (it seems until 2015) there were still all sorts of restrictions on low pricing and write-off of cables and consumables, now it is easier. <br>  Only need to do this.  Admin.  So that it does not hang 100 tons of cables. <br><br>  Otherwise, I didn‚Äôt have any problems with accounting, and in some cases there were very interesting relations with accounting and 1C (knowledgeable people knowingly leave). <br>  Exception: chief accountants from chiefs of type 3, above in the text.  It happens. <br><br>  <b>Admins and Sales / PM / RP</b> <br>  The story of life.  <i>The PMchik comes running and says: ‚ÄúDear friend!</i>  <i>there is office A, so we need to consider our outsourcing budget so that it is beautiful.</i>  <i>Now they spend dozens of milens on their pals. ‚Äù</i>  <i>I ask the question - what do they have, monitoring, requests, sd, inventory.</i>  <i>No, they answer joyfully and piss in their pants, they have nothing, they are beggars!</i>  <i>This is all we have, we will lead them to the bright future by the hand !!!</i>  <i>The main thing for us is to make magic of numbers on a piece of paper and show that they will SAVE if they take us.</i>  <i>Like, the benefits they need to show, you know?</i>  <i>And this moron has to explain the obvious.</i>  <i>That monitoring is a department of people.</i>  <i>With applications, sd, inventory is an even bigger department.</i>  <i>With everything in place, this is a bag of money in service.</i>  <i>And the abysses and their cozy IT otdelchik (in which even there is nothing dazzling) suddenly open - cheap, cool, and native.</i>  <i>But it's all bullshit.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/6af/79d/d31/6af79dd316ad4725aa6d0609d8342a88.jpg"><br><br>  Because who needs someone who needs all pereter and we will take them all the same. <br><br>  <b>Admins and Users</b> <br>  According to my personal assessment, it‚Äôs about 5/1000 problem users.  In other cases, you should try to go deeper into the actual problem.  A simple example: a user complained about slow 1s.  Suddenly, it turned out that the problem was in the network card (more precisely, the wires ‚Äî the network stood at 10 M), and in processing 1s of complex rules for someone ‚Äî what ‚Äî where ‚Äî why. <br>  The main thing is not to let a specialist-enikey to such a user, and moreover not to give enikey anything of glass - not only will it break ... <br><br>  Admins and attempt to enter the international market.  Nothing better than the article <a href="http://www.beerpanda.ru/%3Fp%3D184">Features of national recruitment / recruitment,</a> I have not seen.  Read, think.  At the same time, you can update your profile at least on Linkedin.  You can not?  Then what is the output at the international level, you can talk <br><br>  That's all, albeit confused, confused. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/334442/">https://habr.com/ru/post/334442/</a></p>
