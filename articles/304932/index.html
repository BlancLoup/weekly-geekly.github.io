Experts in the field of data protection discussed the main threats and ways to overcome them when building a cloud infrastructure and moving companies into the public cloud.  The discussion covered both compliance issues and technical aspects of data protection measures, the experiences of which were shared by telecommunication companies, providers and banks. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/rIE9A17Eurk%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjGNPytWYSzrakSfA-vZrGVHuGBgQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

I printed out the 152nd FZ, so if suddenly someone has the desire to see it, so to speak, immediately rely on the actual data, then you can raise your hand, I will gladly pass on these 25 pages of fascinating reading.  Probably, this is all in the introductory part, probably, it makes no sense to speak, that is, the period when everyone said that data protection is very important, has already passed, probably everyone already understands this.  It makes no sense to argue on this topic for a long time, so we will try to go straight to the questions, probably, let the speakers speak, and, in the course of the discussion, discuss all these applied questions. <br><br>  - I will also say a little about the terminology that we will use, which means, according to Law 152, there is such a term as ‚Äúpersonal data operator‚Äù - is it a company or a group of companies, or a person who stores, receives, stores, processes any personal information about a person, it can be phone numbers of passports, last name, first name, patronymic, well, in general, any data that somehow relates to an individual.  I think that this term will be fully used by everyone, and I would like it to just be clear to everyone.  Let's probably ask the question to all participants of the session right away: ‚ÄúHow exactly did you have to deal with this law, because it concerns many aspects of the processing of personal information, how exactly did you have to deal with this law?  How do you actually implement it?  What are the difficulties, what are the subtle points from your practice that you encountered in view of the applicability of 152 FZ? ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c1b/fe7/71b/c1bfe771b00b460a95d721e921cf3b25.jpg"><br><br>  <i>Dmitry Krasnov, Head of the Information Technology Department of JSCB ‚ÄúEducation‚Äù JSC:</i> <br><br>  - Well, let me start as a representative of the bank.  So from the point of view of processing personal data, there are no particular problems that arise, only that it was changed, it was changed several years ago, quite often, and there was uncertainty.  When the law has already become, so to speak, more or less constant, no questions arise.  Information security adds documents, makes the necessary provisions, with each client is taken a signature on the consent of the processing of personal data, and the process is, in principle, debugged.  At the moment, all personal data in the bank is stored in the internal cloud, that is, we are not in a hurry to transfer, as the infrastructure we have already prepared for, ready, and do not see any further prospects, but there are no difficulties with this either.  If you transfer data to third parties, this also includes all bureaucratic processes, they are all spelled out, even more, we have several services that other vendors sell us, there for individuals, it is in our possession in another the company.  And there are no problems with this.  How many inspections and the Central Bank and the Federal Service for the Supervision of Consumer Rights Protection and Food Protection, we passed, and the FSB, there are no problems.  That is, a certain set of documents is requested, the contractual base and all. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9ac/efe/a6e/9acefea6e9fb48b7819642f1f8722b8f.jpg"><br><br>  <i>Andrei Tomilenko, Managing Director, Big Data Host:</i> <br><br>  - From the point of view of hosting an Internet provider, provider of cloud technologies, there are no special problems either.  It is clear that when registering, the user specifies his own basic data: surname, name, patronymic, e-mail, telephone numbers, but the only requirement of the law, in essence, is to state in the offer that the user must agree with the processing of personal data.  At the registration itself, he confirms that he agrees to the processing of personal data, well, everything, and the obligation of the cloud service provider not to provide this data to a third party and ensure their safety.  That's all. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a87/512/766/a87512766d7746838d3ea8c33e563a12.jpg"><br><br>  <i>Artem Fedoseev, Project Manager, RUVDS:</i> <br><br>  - Good afternoon, colleagues!  I would like to add the following thing: based on our hosting experience with our clients, one client who is competent enough in the field of legislation requested us to delete our personal data and before that provide a list of goals for which we collected this data.  It is important to note here that when working with a bank, as a rule, this is a ‚Äúface to face‚Äù client, the client you see, he signs, the paper that he, at least formally, should read, and he understands What this data is processed for.  When, well, in order for you, for example, to get a loan, your credit bureau should evaluate.  When you buy or rent a <a href="https://ruvds.com/">virtual server</a> , the collection, sometimes, of passport data for the client is not obvious.  Why, it would seem, to ask for passport data for a ‚Äúvirtualka‚Äù for 240 rubles?  However, there are legal requirements that force the hosting provider to store data about the client that uses your conditions, uses our services, for the reason that there have been cases of initiation of attacks, in particular on the state.  resources from hosting services.  I won‚Äôt name exactly which ones, but there are a lot of them, and if you study attack statistics, in particular, on banks, you will see that about 10% are DDOS attacks, which, as a rule, are also made from unknown anonymous servers, which were bought or rented without any data.  And this client, demanding to show why we collect data, was absolutely right, because 152 law obliges the provider to explain.  And the same law obliges any data operator, even if it is formally not a data operator on the Roskomnadzor‚Äôs list, to collect only personal data that is sufficient for the provision of services, they should not be redundant.  And there is such a subtle moment when a client requires you to delete data, you are at the same time between two fires: you must delete the data, but at the same time, you have Roskomnadzor, FSTEC, the FSB, which can send a request to you to the company on suspicion of any crime of your client, you must provide all the data.  If you do not save the act of destruction, in which there is a maximum amount of data about the client upon his request, you can become potentially even an accomplice in a crime.  Therefore, there is such a twofold moment that it seems that you have deleted the data, and it‚Äôs like they remained, and you have to provide them, and we should not forget about this, because we, on the one hand, live in Russia, and the more data you have about customers collect, the more safely, the more relaxed you sleep.  That is why a colleague does not want to keep Roskosmos data, because he wants to sleep, God forbid, something will happen to him.  Here, it is necessary even at a small level to take into account.  Roughly speaking, I like to give an example that even if you own a simple barbershop who records a regular customer‚Äôs phone, in fact you are also governed by this law, another thing is that if you have not transferred these data to a party, you are not obliged to register in the prescribed manner.  Here is a comment on how this law as a whole is applicable in practice.  I probably would like to listen to Vadim on this topic. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/573/af4/57c/573af457c7a84f15b6baa9d2ab25b4cd.jpg"><br><br>  <i>Vadim Frolov, General Director, Telecommunication Company MediaSoft:</i> <br><br>  - Yes, well, in fact, personal data, we are also providers, that is, to justify the registration of any login, we store the login in accordance with the name or legal entity, and, well, contact e-mail, contact numbers.  Well, that is, it was introduced, we gave it to outsourcing, plus we additionally did, well, as if our own security systems, well, this is a server access control system where servers are stored directly on the server with personal data, well, video surveillance systems.  Usually, questions on this law arise or when conflicts arise with clients, well, I understand that he just wanted to force you to do something, no more than, I think, or if a leak occurs, well, there they will be stolen and published by security .  And a scandal will arise, and then, probably, some questions will arise.  But in general, in principle, the law is fairly normal and simple to comply with, you just need to try to avoid some kind of conflict situations, in other cases, people probably never ask about it and don‚Äôt think about it. <br><br>  <i>Kirill Zapolsky (Moderator):</i> - I would just like to come back a little bit again when preparing for today's event, on the contrary I read a lot of reviews on the fact that many people don‚Äôt understand how this law works, many people don‚Äôt understand any aspects, many aspects are very, very vague, they use wording such as ‚Äúsufficient, necessary‚Äù, that is, what, God forbid, in court can be interpreted in two ways.  Here I would like to clarify with the participants, who, it seemed to me, demonstrated a very confident vision of their future regarding this law.  Is everything really so smooth there?  Are all the wordings of this law clear, all the points easy to implement, and the only thing you need is to follow the letter of the law? <br><br>  <i>Artyom Fedoseev:</i> - Just now we are in the process of obtaining a FSTEC license, and therefore we have to study the requirements of the federal service for technical and export control quite meticulously enough.  There really are a lot of formulations, such that "your means of protection must ensure an adequate level of data security."  There is a whole set of software or hardware, essentially some sensors, which with different licensing, that is, you can get on the means of protecting confidential information to develop these means of protection.  If you protect the premises, then you have a rather long list of sensors that until recently could have been bought abroad at all, in connection with the sanctions, in connection with this whole situation, you only have to turn to Russian counterparts, whose production is not at such a massive level implemented, first, and secondly, the quality, unfortunately, according to the same licensees, it is inferior to Western counterparts.  This is despite the fact that Western counterparts are also certified by the FSB, so there are certain problems.  And when you choose from this list, you seem to be making enough effort to work, but it is always possible to say from the regulator, who will check you every year, which, in their opinion, is not enough.  For example, you have 2 rooms that are protected, or rather one main room is protected, where the database is located, and in the other you, for example, have ventilation, there is a pipe between them, which is used to run air.  Here there is a whole list of potential sensors that need to be put into the pipe, in order to control the non-transmission of sound information there, not to mention, in my opinion, the absolutely delusional requirements of some licensees to protect against leakage from induced beams from CRT monitors, which are now not used anywhere.  And even if you do not use them, they can make you put this sensor.  And this, of course, is, in my opinion, I will say, it may not be very official, but this is nonsense.  Yes, there are also statements from the Central Bank, which are also rather vague, they do not seem to prohibit, but not explicitly allow.  And the wording is ‚Äúgood enough,‚Äù they are very similar to Western laws, where lawmakers proceed from the general level of citizens who will do it for the good of other citizens.  And they will definitely understand the phrase "good."  In our specificity, unfortunately, the phrase ‚Äúwell‚Äù can be understood by different parties in completely different ways.  This, unfortunately, is, in my subjective opinion, it is.  And now it is precisely for this reason that we therefore prescribe for a very long time all the points on licensing our company, in order not to fall for such things later.  My opinion is this. <br><br>  <i>Kirill Zapolsky (Moderator):</i> - From here, I think you can immediately withdraw the question: ‚ÄúHow much does this storage infrastructure cost in general, in order to observe everything, put sensors, that is, if we talk to ordinary people about storing information, they think that it is just a server, on which there is a disk of some kind, yes, and software that somehow protects.  As it turns out, not quite.  How much does it all cost?  How long and expensive to install all this? <br><br>  <i>Artyom Fedoseyev:</i> - If we are talking about protecting the data center, then only information protection tools, without the production of protection means, that is, we are not Kaspersky, we do not program the antivirus, then this is a price tag of at least 1 million rubles, it‚Äôs straight , no frills, without hiring certified employees who should be in the company.  Moreover, now it is still possible that the Government will issue a resolution that these employees should have management experience, the previous one, that is, there will also be a conflict, because where can we get so many security guards.  As far as I know, MSU produces information security specialists at the military department, there are about 60 or 100 people graduating annually, plus a stream of programmers at the VMK.  Obviously, such volumes, they are even less in other universities, they will not provide the industry with the necessary number of specialists, so here too there is such a moment that they are threatening to adopt such a resolution.  From a million it is just the minimum, and then it depends on the fantasy.  This builds a whole business, there can be very large amounts of money. <br><br>  <i>Dmitry Krasnov:</i> - Let me add, we are like a bank, every 5 years we undergo a re-certification of the FSB, and now the last re-certification, it was a year ago, and in principle, did not cause any special problems, yes, that‚Äôs right, Artem said, we have this the room, the server, yes it is really certified, prepared, there are all these sensors.  And having invested in this structure once, we calmly pass the recertification.  But sometimes, yes, they endure some comments related to technical or access, but they all give time to eliminate them, so do not be afraid of it.  And I do not think that this is a big problem, on the other hand, for a long time, yes, but then you will have a document with which you will attract all customers. <br><br>  <i>Artyom Fedoseyev:</i> - Here is the receipt of the FSTEC license, in general, in my opinion, it is more expedient than obtaining a western license, with all due respect to our eldest western partners, for the reason that there are significantly more service consumers with a similar license, the same banks, same brokers.  It‚Äôs one thing to transfer some customer data to the cloud, perhaps even impersonal, or to store some part of accounting there, another thing is when we have a full license, we can literally duplicate the entire infrastructure, up to 80% of a broker or a bank.  And naturally the price tag there will not be the same as for a retail client for a server there for 200 rubles.  Of course, all these costs, they will be reflected in prices, but there‚Äôs just a balance so that the client does not need to maintain the infrastructure.  This is a significant advantage of the conversion from CAPEX to OPEX, while being sure that the counterparty is responsible for his actions and has licenses, and in case of some failure he is responsible for this not just there with some words that we are different we know a friend, everything will be fine, and his license will be revoked and he will lose money.  But in general, obtaining a license is already a year of time, that is, it is a pity.  Therefore, when someone already has something to lose, especially to the one who receives money, in this case it is the service provider, this is a more reliable scheme of work. <br><br>  <i>Kirill Zapolsky (Moderator):</i> - I also wanted to clarify how time-consuming the process of obtaining all these licenses is, how long it takes, how many documents it takes, how many people and days you need to spend hours studying acts to make this work? <br><br>  <i>Dmitry Krasnov:</i> - Correctly said, about a year.  Not only is the study of acts, you need to select specialists, and follow their certificates so that they correspond, they have an education.  This is quite a difficult process. <br><br>  <i>Kirill Zapolsky (Moderator):</i> - We need to understand right away that such a process is available only to large companies, banks, specialized institutions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6ea/45b/ef1/6ea45bef19514cef82b3d7456d9e8ffa.jpg"><br><br>  <i>Artyom Fedoseyev:</i> - Roughly speaking, if a company has such a license, then clearly not a one-day, as Nikita cited an example, that the data center seemed to be like that, but the next day it was gone, that is, this is a different level of relationship.  And here there is just another moment that it‚Äôs natural to get a license, you hire a legal agency that helps you go through all the steps in order not to reinvent the wheel.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But unfortunately, in our city, at least, there is a very famous agency, I will not call it, who will look for information, will find that they take money for you to learn all this, and take a lot of money. Therefore, even when you are going to get a license, you also have to approach the choice of a law firm very well, very carefully, for the reason that in essence they have to teach you how to work correctly, and not to say that here are the links to the laws, study, we you just take the money for sending you a letter to the FSTEC. They should bear the teaching role, in particular, how to work correctly. Here's a moment more. </font></font><br><br> <i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Kirill Zapolsky (Moderator):</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Well, we got the infrastructure, we got the licenses, how expensive it is to support this whole thing, because it is known that the cost of support, some IT solutions and licenses may be just training new personnel, if suddenly a person has quit , gone, came new. What is the percentage of it? How expensive is it to maintain the entire infrastructure and in general, how often do the requirements for this infrastructure change and how expensive is the whole thing to be updated? </font></font><br><br> <i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Dmitry Krasnov:</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- I, as a bank, need to support such an infrastructure not only to comply with the law on the protection of personal data, I have many requirements from other regulators, they, in principle, are suitable for one room. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I really need to have it in my organization. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Another thing is for organizations that do not need it and who are only concerned with the preservation of personal data. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">They, of course, will be more profitable to place in the cloud. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I honestly do not consider such numbers, because I do not need to count it. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I just need to do it.</font></font> That's all. <br><br> <i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Artem Fedoseev:</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Actually, we still get it, but I assume that the very existence of a license should not be a determining factor in terms of relations with the client. There are certain moral norms, ethical norms. I understand that if I am with a client who does not need FSTEC, he‚Äôs treated as not a normal client, i.e. give his data, do not follow this, do not protect, then my business will not work. The FSTEC is like a certain diploma of a person, a certain brand that shows that you are thinking about something and, in general, you can do business. But this is not a sufficient condition for work. It is possible and without this license to work according to the norms of FSTEC as a whole, so that the client is satisfied and understands that these are normal people. In general, in general, regardless of whether you work in Broker, you work in Hosting, it is important for the client to have feedback with the company.</font></font> Those.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">if he understands that the company treats him as a subhuman, then he does not care whether you have a license or not. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And if you do not have a license, but at the same time you are sensitive to every request of the client, then success will come soon. </font></font><br><br> <i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Kirill Zapolsky (Moderator):</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> - I would like to ask you a little about what, in fact, what are we protecting ourselves from? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What are the most common types of attacks and what are they trying to do with the infrastructure?</font></font> Those.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">somehow loosen, get data out of there, compromise. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What do you most often encounter as specialists in this field? </font></font><br><br> <i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Dmitry Krasnov:</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> - I have the biggest risk - this is the substitution of payment.</font></font> Those.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I have the risk that my data will not be taken away, but that they will be changed. And all the actions that we build on security, they are aimed at avoiding this risk. Two years ago, there were still attacks on remote banking customer service. It is customers, i.e. substitute payments. And we have struggled with this quite successfully, obliging everyone to use secondary authorization, either SMS, or other technical means. And now there are quite a few such attacks. But the attackers are more focused on the infrastructure of the bank and, in particular, on the machine that is in communication with the Central Bank. And they have to be completely isolated from the Internet, i.e. to separate two networks: the network, which is working with the ABS with the Central Bank and the network, which has access to the Internet. But here, too, big problems arise as to divide it all,if we keep accessing the Internet, theoretically, of course, an attacker can penetrate and forge somehow the payment. In general, this is indeed a very big problem, and the Central Bank, even, it acknowledges. And in the media there is information about such hacks that were carried out, so this is a really big problem. Even when they get hold of at least one computer of the bank‚Äôs network, this is already a huge risk for the bank‚Äôs business. Not for customers, but for the business of the bank.this is a huge risk for the bank‚Äôs business. Not for customers, but for the business of the bank.this is a huge risk for the bank‚Äôs business. Not for customers, but for the business of the bank.</font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8d7/823/3c2/8d78233c22864b4f9503379407b6b593.jpg"><br><br> <i> ,  DMA   ,  ¬´¬ª:</i> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- I mainly work with clients. I, as a broker representative, provide clients with direct access to the exchange. We have a server that the guys serve in the collocation zone, we also use servers in their data center. And customers are most interested in how data is protected there, whether any attacks pass. They are worried about their strategies, their robots who write. They understand that they go to another level. Regional clients are very worried about this, because they understand that their trading speed improves many times, because the servers are already closer, not in Chelyabinsk. Their laptop sends signals directly to the exchange, and even from the data center of the guys. This is not a lot of money for them and they ask how to defend themselves, from what to defend themselves. In principle, we are sure that all the protection is there. Some DDOS, a small number of clients,but DDOS attacks went through. Everything was successfully repulsed. With viruses, so far, not even had to face, no one has penetrated these computers. There is a completely different protection, as well as by ip-addresses, as Lada said, by ports. In principle, there are no special problems.

As a rule, this happens, that's how Vadim correctly said, game resources are especially susceptible to attacks, here are all sorts of WarCraft, Counter Strike and other guys. They make money in a very competitive market and often their resources really come under attack. If such a client is attacked and it does not use our protection against DDOS attacks, then its ip-address is filtered for a couple of minutes, access to it is blocked, the attack is terminated. Accordingly, the server, the physical unit, all the other clients, they can see some lag in terms of speed reduction, because the channel is clogged, but this is a short-term phenomenon, after the address is locked, everything goes automatically. If the client took advantage, I bought the DDOS protection. We sell it in portions there from 0.5 megabit,someone has enough of it, if you have a small website there, and, in principle, not a huge attendance, this traffic is enough. For example, there, to a large gaming resource, someone takes and 5 megabits of protection. What constitutes protection is analytical protection, which allows not blocking the ip-address, but, namely, filtering incoming traffic, and delivering pure traffic to the server unit at the stated speed. In this case, as a rule: well, in my memory there was no such thing as a client who used DDOS protection because of a DDOS attack. So far we have a very good practice in this regard. The situation when going to the whole server is already a force majeure.

What customers contact us with. In general, why they come to us. There is such a common term in the West as business recovery in the event of the earth‚Äôs descent from orbit. That is, any company should have a plan to restore the entire infrastructure as quickly as possible. Why is it difficult to do when you have your own infrastructure? It went out of order with you, you called the equipment supplier, bought it, set it up, it took an unacceptable amount of time before the real business launch again. When you have cloud storage, employees work in the cloud, all transactions occur in the cloud, all work and this cloud is duplicated, it‚Äôs not enough that you will not immediately raise your business, but much faster than with your infrastructure, so you and the business you can relativate yours as you like. We have a lotas we said in the previous session, customers. They are freelancers who have no workplace, in particular, you know the example of a bank that has one office in development, not a single branch. And, you can imagine, if they go completely to the cloud, what freedom of thought the owner of this bank will have, he can even conduct business from Antarctica. Together with the whole team. This is a big plus. It is clear that there is a balance between what can be given there, what is impossible, there will always be such a problem. And I, as a hoster, want to support Andrew Listopad. I do not need all the customer data, because I want to live in peace and not worry about it. But this aspect still needs to be taken into account: the mobility of the business (as if anti-globalization players were not speaking, globalization is coming), and the business should be more mobile, faster, and it is the cloud technologies that allow them to be.This aspect must also be taken into account.</font></font><br><br> <i>  ():</i> ‚Äî      --    . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/95c/170/9a2/95c1709a286a4d109071abb30f01c9b6.jpg"><br><br> <i> ,  , :</i> <br><br> ‚Äî  ,  .  :  /   .      ,      ? <br>  : ‚Äî     ,  , ,    ,      . <br><br> <i> :</i> ‚Äî    , . <br><br> <i> :</i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- To do this, you must initially make sure that your physical data are in different geographic locations.

That is, when you trade with the world's leading brokers, you will see that you have one data center in the UK, another in Russia, third in Denmark, fourth in America and somewhere else. Only such a structure will definitely allow you to restore everything. If you have all the eggs in one basket, a meteorite fell on Moscow, and you have information in different data centers in Moscow, I'm afraid you will not pick them up.

There was talk that in Kazan they would make a data center for a science city that is being built near Kazan, the same thing in Skolkovo. In Skolkovo data center of Sberbank, in my opinion. Obviously, since the economic life is all going to the center of the country, it is all located here. Due to this, the protests of the eastern part of our country, which are deprived of this infrastructure, are understandable. And these conversations, in order to launch the exchange for the Far East, the spaceport, other construction projects, they potentially, in addition to these projects themselves, must bring along the accompanying infrastructure, which includes communication. And then this region will develop more,but at the moment, the main data centers in Russia are in central Russia. Even in my native Volgograd region, I cannot even remember if there is a data center there.

As for the insurance activities, providers, in this case. If it was organized as deposit insurance, many users would be happy about this, and this need is ripe, because from the point of view of information security, no one wants to take responsibility, everyone ultimately blames the problem on the consumer, but I I think there should be a reliable insurance institution. And the mechanisms need to be developed. In particular, it was about our proposal to create a digital code. I am a representative of FinUniversity. How do you look at solving your problems and the problems of consumers with insurance in the digital sphere? </font></font><br><br> <i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Dmitry Krasnov:</font></font></i> ‚Äî    ‚Äì  ,    ,       ,          .     ‚Äì  . ,  ,    ‚Äì  ,  ,  ,    ,         , ,       .  -,    ,         ,    ,    .          . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/583/eb0/ecd/583eb0ecd66444f6af318921d689f037.jpg"><br><br> <i> ,  , RUVDS</i> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Nikita Tsaplin, RUVDS. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I would like to ask a bit of a reverse question, just now during a break I talked with colleagues, and many note such a trend that, in addition to taxation benefits when transferring to the cloud, and cost savings, cloud service consumers delegate part of the data protection responsibility to industry professionals. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In this case, all the responsibility of the suppliers. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How secure are the service providers? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What kind of liability in case of leakage of personal data may occur for the supplier? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Are suppliers who benefit from such customers who work under such rigid contracts? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How secure is the supplier? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is clear that it is beneficial for the consumer to transfer the responsibility to the supplier. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">That is, we have chosen a supplier - we have removed responsibility. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How secure is the supplier after this?</font></font><br><br> <i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Artem Fedoseev:</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- From the point of view of the law, as I have already said, this moment is very clearly stated here. The first requirement of the law is that the client who transmits the data, suppose the bank, the broker, he is still liable to his final client for his personal data, regardless of whether he transferred them to the second, third or fifth person. No matter what his license. Further, in case of force majeure, the broker's relationship with the cloud provider is only their relationship. The client will only talk with the bank or broker. From the point of view of responsibility, as I said, it is usually regulated by SLA, there is administrative and criminal liability for disclosing confidential information, if it is proved that it was an accidental release, or it was malicious intent, responsibility is different up to the employee. Employeewhich operates under the FSTEC license, it is legally responsible for handling data. Even for plugging a flash drive, I copied the database myself. If someone finds out about this, there is also legal responsibility there. In terms of money, it can only be adjusted SLA. If Sberbank had placed all its data in its data center to Durov, and he would have lost it, I won‚Äôt take anything from Durov except this data center. It is always a balance between risk, quality and service. That is, it must always be understood. If you think: ‚ÄúI have given and now everything is fine,‚Äù and the headache has gone, then this, of course, is absolutely wrong.In terms of money, it can only be adjusted SLA.

They are actively accepting customers, but there have been no precedents for leaks, and in fact, some large bank can easily bankrupt a small provider in the event of a leak. </font></font><br><br> <i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Artem Fedoseev:</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> - Of course, it can.

In my understanding, when you trade, you must distribute your money between brokers and banks. Similarly, there should be a distribution of risk here too. If you have a strategic long-term work plan, you, no matter how good partners you are, should think that you can fall a brick on your head, you should always distribute your business in several directions, so that if something happens, not all the legs of your chair broke down at once. </font></font><br><br> <i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Nikita Tsaplin:</font></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> - Dmitry, does your bank use several vendors for cloud services? </font></font><br><br> <i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Dmitry Krasnov:</font></font></i> ‚Äî      ,      .     ,  ,        . , -,   .     . <br><br> <i> :</i> ‚Äî   , , ,   .    ‚Äì . <br><br> <i> :</i> ‚Äî -. <br><br> <i>  ():</i> ‚Äî      .   , .         ?    ?         ?        ?    ,     ? <br><br> <i> :</i> ‚Äî      IT-  ,         ,       ‚Äì   ,       ,        ,     . ,      .      ‚Äì  ,      , -    ,     ,     ,    .   ,        ,         ,            . <br><br> <i> :</i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Regarding software, Microsoft is already helping with its SPLA solution. Now they modify it in the CSP, give us more leased software to reduce costs. From my point of view, in general, some point of trust should be reached between the business representatives from both sides. Not that even a single precedent. Sberbank made its cloud, sort of like it is. There must be a general state of the atmosphere and climate between the players, that this people have come to do business, and I do business and have one goal. Our industry is quite young, and it just takes some time to physically reach this climate. And, again, on the part of the state, a certain impulse is also needed here, in the sense that on the one hand they must clear the law of vague wording so that everyone can understand the rules of the game,on the other hand, the state itself should set an example in this regard. My documents, I like it in Moscow, that I come, and I do documents in any place, a good step, which shows that it works. In my opinion, the development vector of all is correct. It is clear to everyone why this is necessary, how much it saves and what it leads to, but it takes time to gain confidence in each other in this direction. And, naturally, with the growth of the number of companies with licenses, verified by western players, this will only improve. Here you just need to continue the development, accelerate it somewhat in connection with the sanctions. In general, the direction here is.that it works.
