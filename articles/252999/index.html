She was a success, as can be judged by the full hall and calls with questions: ‚ÄúMaybe there will be a ticket yet?‚Äù.  We will tell you more in detail later, but you can see a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/%3Fset%3Da.744289325669820.1073741832.664072273691526%26type%3D3">photo report</a> , but now I want to tell you about <b>two new conferences</b> that we plan to hold in April. <br><br>  First of all, we want to say that we did not plan to be a vegetarian conference, therefore (but not only) we changed the site and the menu will now be with <strong>meat</strong> !

But still a huge number of developers create or maintain desktop applications, and they may feel deprived.  We want to bring them together, where all the attention will be focused on their problems in solving the tasks of the enterprise, so that they can share knowledge about their approaches to solving various problems.  We collect - professionals in their field so that they share their experience with you.  Feel like a professional, is there an interesting case study, the solution of which can be useful to your colleagues? <br><br>  Subjects of reports: <br><ul><li>  update system development </li><li>  plug-in systems - MEF </li><li>  interesting business cases related to stationary development </li><li>  UI frameworks, UI testing </li><li>  embedding in the system </li><li>  features or some interesting features associated with EF </li><li>  and so on, all that is specific to Windows programs </li></ul><br>  <a href="http://www.gosharp.ru/DESKTOP2015%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26amp%3Butm_medium%3Darticle%26amp%3Butm_content%3DCFP_Desktop_API%26amp%3Butm_campaign%3Dhabrahabr">Registration</a> has already begun.

Why? <br><br>  Because we all work with API - public application contracts.  This is the .Net Framework itself, a huge number of libraries that we use.  Have you ever wondered why some libraries are more popular than others?  Due to what they come to the fore?  The speed of work, completeness and hopelessness are critical, but not unimportant will be the convenience of use. <br><br>  Because every day in the world there are more and more new user services, applications.  All of them do not isolate themselves - they are closely related to each other through public contracts.  Many services do not provide a graphical shell, only a set of different APIs. <br><br>  In our opinion, it is the <strong>API that determines the success and fruitfulness of working with the service</strong> .  But how to build such a contract so that it is convenient for both users and developers?  How to make use of the API obvious and safe?  Do I need to manage the API?  Thousands of questions arise if you want to make a long-lived and popular service, use microservice architecture, or do a framework.  In addition to the external beauty of the code, there must be an internal order - pure code, this will also be an additional topic for discussion at the conference.  For example, we want to find FxCop gurus with interesting stories, or to discuss other tools of similar functionality.  Only practical solutions, self-discipline often suffer from creative people - programmers.  =) <br><br>  The questions raised at the conference will be of interest to all groups of developers, it does not matter if you make websites, portals, services, frameworks, corporate applications, desktop applications.  Even if your application does not communicate with the network, you still have an internal API with which to work with you and even you should try to do it in accordance with the rules for external applications.  If you have something to tell or share your pain, <a href="http://goo.gl/forms/t3n6tcvoE9">leave a request</a> for a report. <br><br>  Subjects of reports: <br><ul><li>  Using and comparing modern approaches to creating APIs: REST, SOAP, RPC. </li><li>  Security issues: the authorization and availability of the API for different groups of users. </li><li>  Support for versioning and general management of available APIs. </li><li>  Creating an obvious and simple API: how to achieve this, what prakitiki and tools can help. </li><li>  Is it possible to control the quality of the code in the team with the help of software?  Using and expanding the capabilities of FxCop and other programs. </li></ul><br><br>  <b>So, we invite:</b> <br><ul><li>  Register for the <a href="http://www.gosharp.ru/DESKTOP2015%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26amp%3Butm_medium%3Darticle%26amp%3Butm_content%3DCFP_Desktop_API%26amp%3Butm_campaign%3Dhabrahabr">Desktop UI &amp; Business Application</a> conference on April 11 and <a href="http://www.gosharp.ru/API2015%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26amp%3Butm_medium%3Darticle%26amp%3Butm_content%3DCFP_Desktop_API%26amp%3Butm_campaign%3Dhabrahabr">API &amp; Clean Code</a> on April 25. </li><li>  Apply <a href="http://goo.gl/forms/t3n6tcvoE9">for reports</a> . </li></ul><br><br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/252999/">https://habr.com/ru/post/252999/</a></p>
