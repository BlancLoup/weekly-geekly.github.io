  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What drones are used in world cinema</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nb/_3/oa/nb_3oagxende9ep2jk3tfx987li.png"><br><br>  Amateur drones can shoot great shots, but their payloads are low, so they are not suitable for professional use.  Drones for filming are often inferior to their light counterparts in flight duration (usually it is no more than 15-20 minutes), but the developers create models that can hold out in the air for up to half an hour. <br><br>  Professional drones can buy anyone, the prices of them you will find in this post.  But for large film projects, quadcopters do not buy or rent separately - there are special companies that provide shooting services along with the work of a team of operators.  Each drone has its own specifics and requires the ability to handle it.

In essence, Hollywood itself can order the development and manufacture of new models of devices that they need for camera work, but this is not necessary: ​​there are already many companies that provide services without any problems.  The cost of one day of renting a professional quadcopter with a team of operators is about $ 15,000, and given the fact that aerial surveying services are usually not needed for the entire shooting, the amount does not affect the total budget of the film - Vladimir Bely told this <a href="http://www.forbes.ru/svoi-biznes/istorii-uspekha/297365-kak-rossiiskii-razrabotchik-bespilotnikov-pokoryaet-gollivud">in an article for Forbes.</a> . <br><br>  Vladimir Bely is the owner of one of the Russian companies that build and rent professional drones.  His company Alpha Smart Systems produces about 150 drones per year, the cost of each of them varies from 1-1.5 million rubles, and the cost is about 700,000 rubles.  Individual development of the drone is more expensive, up to 30 million rubles.  Such a drone is designed for about a month and takes another three days to assemble. <br><br>  At the same time, the company does not receive the main revenue from the development of drones and related products, but from renting them out with pilot support.  One shooting day in Russia costs 120,000 rubles. <br><br>  Most Russian companies use ready-made drones for the film industry, and only a few develop their own professional drones. <br><br><h2>  Movies and scenes shot by drones </h2><br>  <b>Skyfall (2012)</b> <br><br>  The motorcycle racing scene shot by the drone became so popular in Hollywood that after it, the FAA European Aviation Safety Agency granted permission to six film companies to commercially use unmanned drones. <br><br>  Drone supplier <br>  QNX Software Systems <br><br>  Drone <br>  Flying-Cam 3.0 SARAH <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/13DQS1AHdXg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>The Wolf of Wall Street (2013)</b> <br><br>  From the bird's eye view, the American company Freefly Cinema helped the film crew to create the frames of the film “Wolf of Wall Street”.  Shooting from the air party in the pool were shot by the drone using a Canon C500 camera with 4K quality attached to the drone Freefly. <br><br>  Drone supplier <br>  Freefly cinema <br><br>  Drone <br>  Freefly <br><br>  <b>Spectrum (2015)</b> <br><br>  One of the most dynamic scenes of the movie was James Bond running across the roof, mostly the scene was shot using rooftop drones near Trafalgar Square in London. <br><br>  For filming the company needed a special permit from the Civil Aviation Authority, because the scene was filmed at night, and the use of UAVs in central London is limited for security purposes. <br><br>  Drone supplier <br>  Helicopter Film Services <br><br>  Drone <br>  Aerigon MK II <br><br>  <b>The Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015)</b> <br><br>  The company Helicopter Film Services filmed aerial scenes in Hendon (UK).  A team of three people served a quadrocopter, on which the RED Dragon camera was installed. <br><br>  The team shot the background scenes and action, acting in accordance with the instructions of the director Joss Whedon and the second director Ben Davis.  The camera took pictures of individual parts of the city, and from the recruitment of these frames, special effects specialists made a common 3D model. <br><br>  Drone supplier <br>  Helicopter Film Services <br><br>  Drone <br>  Aerigon MK II <br><br>  <b>A robot named Chappi (2015)</b> <br><br>  In the film, one of the robots flies through a glass window at full speed.  This scene was shot using a drone, and although the frame could not have been captured with a helicopter, it could have been done with a cable camera.  Nevertheless, the choice fell on a quadrocopter, which made the scene more dynamic. <br><br>  Drone supplier <br>  Drone crew <br><br>  Drone <br>  Red scarlet <br><br>  <b>Jurassic World (2015)</b> <br><br>  Aerial scenes were captured with the RED Dragon camera and the SHOTOVER K1 system with a FUJINON 19-90mm Cabrio lens. <br><br>  Drone supplier <br>  Team 5 Aerial System Rentals <br><br>  Drone <br>  Unknown <br><br>  <b>The Expendables 3 (2014)</b> <br><br>  About 30 scenes of the film were shot on the drone, including the first one, which displays a shootout of a train and a helicopter. <br><br>  Drone supplier <br>  ZM Interactive <br><br>  Drone <br>  Unknown <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2JuITWX871M" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (2002)</b> <br><br>  The scene with the flying machine was created with the help of computer graphics, but the basis for it was taken with the help of a drone. <br><br>  Drone supplier <br>  Unknown <br><br>  Drone <br>  Flying-Cam 3.0 SARAH <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cPsIU9BTbcQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  A drone on the set <a href="https://inspaceforum.ru/ru/conference-drone%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_campaign%3D12-03%26utm_content%3D12-03-3">can replace</a> the crane’s work for the camera crew and even a helicopter, and the quality of the shooting will be higher.  The drone is much more mobile than these systems and allows you to take pictures from completely different angles, as well as quickly change the distance to the object - now it displays highlights in the actor’s eyes, and after a few seconds it shows the scene from a bird’s-eye view. <br><br>  Since drones are much less expensive than a camera group, they are widely used in cinema.  To create high-quality video content, you need a powerful drone that can lift a heavy video camera, work in all weather conditions, and provide an even picture with the help of a stabilization system. <br><br>  <i>Learn more about the use of drones for business <a href="https://inspaceforum.ru/ru/conference-drone%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_campaign%3D12-03%26utm_content%3D12-03-4">at the conference on March 21</a> .</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/410973/">https://habr.com/ru/post/410973/</a></p>
