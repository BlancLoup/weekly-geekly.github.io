More recently, we opened this Internet service, designed to help people get rid of burning tickets sooner or, on the contrary, to get them at a nice price.  A simple and convenient message board generated by users allows you to quickly place information about your offer, which immediately appears on the main page.  At the same time, putting up a single ticket for sale due to the changed plans, the same user can find something new for himself, starting with an invitation to the water park and ending with a roundtrip to Goa and back.  The latter is just waiting for its new owner right now, for only 15,000 rubles, a temptation not easy. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

    <h4>  Reflections and Aspirations </h4><br>  We have to admit that the use of the resource is rather specific: it‚Äôs not every day that we get into a situation where we urgently need to sell a ticket for a concert, a sports match, a theater, a cinema, a plane, a tour, and anywhere.  That is why it was absolutely necessary for us to draw to the site the attention of a certain ‚Äúcrowd‚Äù, of which at least 5% would at that moment really be puzzled by the need to resell the ticket.  During the New Year holidays, the number of various events, parties, and plans for a restful future increases dramatically, so it was not by chance that we chose this time to start.  ‚ÄúIt would be great to arrange a session of interaction with a large number of people at the same time - preferably young people, among whom information about the new one is transmitted, as is well known, monstrously quickly,‚Äù we thought, and finally it was found. <br><br><h4>  Event </h4><br>  <a href="http://www.lookatme.ru/cities/moscow/events/88485">The concert ‚ÄúLet's live!‚Äù On Vasilyevsky Spusk</a> in the framework of the Year of Youth promised to gather as many as 30,000 people.  Young and not indifferent people were planning to clash in a single impulse in order to <i>‚Äústart a new life - healthy, filled with the struggle with bad habits and diseases, and not with one‚Äôs own organism, a life guarantor of which will be a healthy diet, sport and good health.‚Äù</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7f9/f5c/e6a/7f9f5ce6a2c0cca461eb27ded5285174.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Famous media personalities, DJs and musicians led by Timati, finally creeping out of the solarium, and free mittens attracted a multi-headed crowd, which we were immediately ready to warm up in our warm advertising embraces.  Socio-demographic indicators of the audience of the event more fully corresponded to the ideas of our future user: this is a young earthling of any sex, leading a fairly active lifestyle, his plans are constantly changing under the influence of circumstances. <br><br>  30,000 young females willing to be involved;  300,000 fingers, able to type in the address bar address GoritBilet.ru;  300,000 fingers, icy in the cold ‚Äî20 degrees Celsius;  open-air concert, three cold hours on Vasilyevsky Spusk.  Largely due to these facts, the idea was born. <br><br><h4>  Idea </h4><br>  We decided that hot tea is the best way to non-standardly declare our product and cause a positive public reaction.  We placed advertising information on cups: funny stickers told about how you can use a simple paper cup if you are lucky enough to buy a burning ticket on our website.  Also banners and flyers were involved in the communication. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/313/492/590/3134925904b1634c001d19c7f625c79a.jpg" alt="image"><br><h4></h4><br><h4>  What is the result? </h4><br>  People rushed to the place of free tea, knocking down all life in its path.  But, given that the public was 5 times less than planned, and pouring tea in such a crush was monstrously difficult, we distributed only 1,900 cups of 4000 printed.  And they could be quite happy if not for the eloquent figures: the <b>site after the event was visited by only ... 80 people.</b>  We believe that the main reason for the fiasco is a strange but important trifle: in such a cold, people hold a glass with both hands and do not look at its special design at all. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dbe/22a/26f/dbe22a26ff97f0630f51f9c7be35f341.jpg" alt="two hands"><br><br>  Nevertheless, I am glad at least that a minimum of resources were invested in this action: almost all the components (tent, tables, cups, tea, etc.) were provided by the organizers interested in their audience not getting numb. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7a8/f8b/64a/7a8f8b64ab6f8dda5b8c748adc0981b7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And we, thus, have received important experience and now we want to increase it with the help of esteemed apologists of Habra.  Tell, comrades, how do you feel about such manifestations of non-standard marketing in the context of promoting start-ups, share successful examples (if any) or ideas (if you do not mind) - we are always ready to test them and test performance using our own budgets. <br><br>  In addition, we promise to continue to create topics that highlight our risks, shifts and exploits on the marketing field goritbilet.ru.  We cherish the hope that this can be useful and interesting to many. <br><br>  Our experimental laboratory <a href="http://goritbilet.ru/">GoritBilet.ru</a> thanks you and waves an imaginary cone in parting.  Viva at risk! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/79528/">https://habr.com/ru/post/79528/</a></p>
