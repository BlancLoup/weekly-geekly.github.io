  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Army of Lovers - Videovaganza</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The very first music in my life was they - <b>Army of Lovers</b> .  That is, of course, I had listened to music before that, but it was just a background.  And I wanted to listen to them again and again, to find new albums, and old ones too.  Well, in general, a normal set of fans.  Over time, of course, the songs become boring, and the group has broken up, but what constantly fascinates me is their clips.  Thanks to YouTube, I‚Äôll share with you my favorite videos. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  <b>Crucified</b> (1991) <b>3:42</b> <br>  Jean-Pierre in leather diapers behind the bars and in the bathroom, Baard tainting on a toy piano, Camilla with a rose in a causal place.  Well, the song itself, which was a mega-hit of all the disco 16 years ago. <br>  Baard: " <i>Our little plays never helped Jean-Pierre, he could not get rid of his religious doubts. We had to chain him up so that he would not eat himself completely in the process of samoedtstsva</i> ." <br>  Jean-Pierre: ‚Äú <i>It was very strange, I usually choose my food very carefully. I really could eat a piece of myself to show everyone what a terrible world we live in. I couldn‚Äôt wear anything except tight leather diapers. But Alexander‚Äôs support helped I get cured ... it seems</i> . " <br>  Baard: " <i>Yes, I really helped him a lot, although judge for yourself whether he is crazy or not</i> ." <br><video>  http://www.youtube.com/v/vYT2aWavXlc </video><br><br>  <b>Obsession</b> (1991) <b>3:43</b> <br>  Brain transplantation of Baardu, Jean-Pierre on roller skates in the role of a clockwork soldier constantly repeating the letter "A", and, of course, nurse Michaelella. <br>  Jean-Pierre: " <i>Alexander's love affair and the phenomenon he came across in the bathroom finished him off. He started having visions, he began to hear voices, he even imagined that we are demons who want to offend him. Fortunately, Uncle Michaella led famous mental hospital, which was called "St. Petersburg</i> ". " <br>  Baard: " <i>Electroshock therapy and lobotomy have had their magical effects and now I feel much better</i> ." <br><video>  http://www.youtube.com/v/0RI0dU3RbSw </video>

      <b>Israelism</b> (1993) <b>3:34</b> <br>  Jean-Pierre as Moses and the Drivers of the Slaves.  Slaves, respectively, Baard, Michaelle and Dominic.  Israeli flags and stars of David, pouring wine from Mikaella's chest to the bath with Jean-Pierre. <br>  Baard: <i>Jean-Pierre managed to gain his faith and religion and now he feels much better.</i> <br>  Jean-Pierre: <i>Yes, I managed to find peace and put an end to my doubts.</i>  <i>I feel rested, renewed.</i>  <i>I was born again.</i>  <i>As if.</i>  <i>Like.</i>  <i>In a fit of inspiration, I decided to write a song about how happy I am and how beautiful our life is.</i>  <i>I am very proud of this song, but I do not know where the chorus came from.</i>  <i>I do not know what I was thinking then.</i> <br>  Baard: <i>When I saw how happy</i> ZHP <i>, I decided to write a song about how happy he is and how beautiful life is.</i>  <i>I am very proud of this song, especially the refrain, although I don‚Äôt know where it came from.</i> <br>  Micaella: <i>When I saw how happy Jean-Pierre was, I decided to write a song about how happy he is and how beautiful life is.</i>  <i>I am very proud of this song, especially the refrain, although I don‚Äôt know where it came from.</i> <br>  Dominica: <i>Let me.</i>  <i>When I first met them at the casino, they were so beautiful and happy that I decided to write a song about how happy they are and how beautiful life is.</i>  <i>I am very proud of this song, especially the refrain, although I don‚Äôt know where it came from.</i> <br><video>  http://www.youtube.com/v/DD4EJ6OJKlI </video><br><br>  <b>Lit De Parade</b> (1994) <b>3:14</b> <br>  This is the first video I saw.  Knight with gravestones with rotten teeth, who sings this song.  Army Lover rides in the position and mocks the driver.  Another quintessential absurdity. <br><video>  http://www.youtube.com/v/limz_8_IvuU </video><br><br>  <b>Ride the Bullet</b> (1990) <b>3:46</b> <br>  In general, there are two video versions of this song.  In the first, which I present to your attention, Camilla is the soloist, and in the second - Michaelle.  For some reason I like the first option more.  Jean-Pierre plays the little violin, Alexander flirts with Lenin‚Äôs huge bust, and Camilla sparkles with a shiny ass. <br>  Baard: <i>This clip was shot at the very beginning of our career.</i>  <i>Since we are used to not leaving the house because of a less significant royal dinner party, we thought it would be nice to make a video clip in our living room, where we actually recorded this song.</i> <br>  Jean-Pierre: <i>Honestly, I never liked the wallpaper in our living room.</i>  <i>And the floor.</i>  <i>We had to change the floor, because the old one almost did not shine.</i>  <i>In general, from the very beginning I had doubts about shooting a video in this room.</i> <br>  Baard: <i>The movie rolls up on the background of a small statue of Lenin, which we managed to smuggle out of Russia before the start of perestroika.</i>  <i>She reminds me of the glorious days of the Cold War.</i> <br>  Jean-Pierre: <i>Although the video turned out quite good, considering that this was my directorial debut.</i>  <i>In the end, the movie was filmed in 1975.</i> <br><video>  http://www.youtube.com/v/e-Tbrv6O4Zs </video><br><br>  <b>Sexual Revolution</b> (1994) <b>3:57</b> <br>  Well, this is no comment.  It seems likely that the most famous clip is Army of Lovers in the open spaces of the USSR. <br><video>  http://www.youtube.com/v/5tkR8D7RV_8 </video></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/5193/">https://habr.com/ru/post/5193/</a></p>
