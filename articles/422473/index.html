This time, we are launching improvements for the Web IDE, support for importing Android project manifests, and customizable project templates. </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2 id="predprosmotr-izmeneniy-v-web-ide">  Preview of changes in the Web IDE </h2><br><p>  The Web IDE makes it quicker and easier to make changes to projects with an improved code editor with commit preparation (staging) directly from the browser.  In GitLab 11.2, we did everything so that you could immediately see the effect of code changes and could even debug to a commit.  Now you can <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/422473/">run a preview of the JavaScript of the web application in the Web IDE</a> , to view your changes in real time, next to the code for the user side. </p><br><p>  In addition, from 11.2 you can rename and delete files, as well as change branches, while remaining in the Web IDE. </p><br><h2 id="import-android-proektov">  Import Android Projects </h2><br><p>  Previously, importing projects with a complex multi-level structure was a boring and time consuming task.  With our new feature, <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/422473/">XML manifest support</a> , you can import large projects with multiple repositories in one package at once, including the Android operating system code from the <a href="https://source.android.com/">Android Open Project (AOSP)</a> . </p><br><h2 id="uprostili-razvertyvanie-gitlab-v-oblake">  Simplified GitLab deployment in the cloud </h2><br><p>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/422473/">Helm Chart to deploy GitLab in the cloud has been released</a> (general availability, GA).  This will help you deploy GitLab to Kubernetes faster.  Helm chart represents a more native cloud architecture with a container for each GitLab component and does not require shared storage.  The result is increased flexibility, scalability and GitLab performance on Kubernetes.  <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/">GitLab Runner is</a> deployed with GitLab, which makes it easy to start with GitLab CI / CD. </p><br><h2 id="i-dazhe-bolshe">  And even more! </h2><br><p>  A few more additions will help you and your team more effectively manage projects.  Starting from GitLab 11.2, GitLab instance administrators can customize <strong><a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/422473/">project templates</a></strong> that are <strong><a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/422473/">common to an instance</a></strong> , enabling users to start new projects faster by automating repetitive tasks. </p><br><p>  At the same time, features such as <strong><a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/422473/">task lists</a></strong> , <strong><a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/422473/">grouped by milestone</a></strong> , <strong><a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/422473/">total weights</a></strong> for lists on the task board, <strong><a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/422473/">group milestones in the milestones panel</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/422473/">todo for epics</a></strong> simplify work management. </p><br><h2 id="kazhdyy-mozhet-vnesti-svoy-vklad">  Everyone can contribute </h2><br><p>  Many of these changes were made by the huge GitLab community.  We look forward to your feedback and improvements for these new features.  Together we are a great team! </p><br><p>  Let us know what you think, in the comments <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/2018/08/22/gitlab-11-2-released/">to the blog article</a> - and on Habr√© too.  What do you expect from this release?  What should we continue to work on? </p><br><p>  Thanks for being part of GitLab! </p><br><p>  <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/events/">We invite to our meetings</a> </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1f4/2b7/125/1f42b7125b8e58f40d41c3350cac3ffa.png" alt="GitLab MVP badge"></p><br><h2 id="mvphttpsaboutgitlabcommvp-etogo-mesyaca--jx-terryhttpsgitlabcomjxterry">  This month's <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/mvp/">MVP</a> - <a href="https://gitlab.com/jxterry">JX Terry</a> </h2><br><p>  Thanks to JX Terry for implementing a new option for users - the ability <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/422473/">to make your profile page private</a> ! </p><br><h2 id="osnovnye-novye-fichi-reliza-gitlab-112">  Main new features of GitLab 11.2 release </h2><br><h2 id="obrabotka-koda-na-storone-polzovatelya-v-web-ide">  Processing code on the user side in the Web IDE </h2><br><p>  CORE, STARTER, PREMIUM, ULTIMATE, FREE, BRONZE, SILVER, GOLD </p><br><p>  Working on web applications is much easier and faster when you see your changes right away.  Modern JavaScript frameworks support live preview (live preview), eliminating the need to restart the server and refresh the browser page.  But earlier you did not have the opportunity to see the changes before the commit when editing a web application through the Web IDE. </p><br><p>  Starting with GitLab 11.2, you can view your JavaScript applications in the Web IDE and see the changes in real time.  This allows you to test fixes before committing, experimenting with changes or even making changes to open source projects without cloning them to your machine. </p><br><p>  Processing on the user side is done using <a href="https://codesandbox.io/">CodeSandbox</a> .  It can be enabled by the administrator for your GitLab instances and is already working for all projects on GitLab.com.  This year we will also add <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/4013">server-side processing</a> using GitLab CI, which will give you the opportunity to test and view applications in Ruby and more! </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sSWu6TyubTE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><p>  <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/web_ide/">Documentation for processing code on the user's side</a> and the <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/47268">original ticket</a> . </p><br><h2 id="nastraivaemye-shablony-proektov-dlya-vashego-instansa-gitlab">  Customizable project templates for your GitLab instance </h2><br><p>  PREMIUM, ULTIMATE </p><br><p>  In today's fast-growing development environments, moving from an idea to a new project is still a tedious task.  A huge amount of sample code and administrative tasks make it more difficult to get started. </p><br><p>  In this release, we gave organizations the opportunity to manage their own project templates.  The GitLab instance administrator can select a group of projects from your instance that will be the source of such templates.  All projects directly from this group (but not from subgroups) will be available as templates when creating a new project. </p><br><p>  All information about the repository and database of the project template will be copied to your new project, including the project and wiki repositories, tasks, project settings and more. </p><br><p>  <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/admin_area/custom_project_templates.html">Documentation for custom project templates</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/6860">original ticket</a> . </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/557/b68/86e/557b6886e87c6a51173ffbf0f308342a.png" alt="Custom project templates"></p><br><h2 id="lichnye-statusy-v-profile">  Personal statuses in profile </h2><br><p>  CORE, STARTER, PREMIUM, ULTIMATE, FREE, BRONZE, SILVER, GOLD </p><br><p>  Cooperation is the main principle for working with GitLab.  When using GitLab every day with colleagues and the community, it will be convenient to talk about what you are doing and what your load is now. </p><br><p>  With the release of GitLab 11.2, statuses have become available in your personal profile!  In the profile settings, you can now add status from the message and emoji.  The status will be displayed on your page, as well as in the comments and headlines about the author, showing your current status to everyone who works with you. </p><br><p>  Thank you <a href="https://gitlab.com/niedermyer">Luke Niedermyer</a> for this initiative! </p><br><p>  <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/">Documentation on statuses</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/35463">original ticket</a> . </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ec5/67d/986/ec567d986d265159424c35035c70a17c.png" alt="Personal status messages"></p><br><h2 id="uluchshennyy-poisk-v-paneli-navigacii">  Improved search in the navigation bar </h2><br><p>  CORE, STARTER, PREMIUM, ULTIMATE, FREE, BRONZE, SILVER, GOLD </p><br><p>  As projects and groups grow, it becomes more and more difficult to find them, so GitLab requires a powerful search.  In this release, we take a step towards a more understandable, convenient and easy search. </p><br><p>  In 11.2 we improved it by removing the search limit in the current group and project.  Instead of restricting the search to the project or group in which you are located, GitLab now allows you to search across the entire instance from any page immediately. </p><br><p>  Now we show the icons of groups and projects in the results, and expanded the search bar and the results of the issue, which made the search easier and more convenient. </p><br><p>  <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/search/">Documentation on the search</a> and the <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/36409">original ticket</a> . </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/95d/705/c80/95d705c809dd743d031027952755baeb.png" alt="Improved top-navigation search"></p><br><h2 id="podderzhka-importa-android-proektov">  Support for importing Android projects </h2><br><p>  CORE, STARTER, PREMIUM, ULTIMATE, FREE, BRONZE, SILVER, GOLD </p><br><p>  Previously, importing projects with a complex multi-level structure was a boring and time consuming task. </p><br><p>  In this release, we present support for manifest files for importing projects.  The manifest XML file contains information about which repositories should be connected to the project, which allows you to import large structures at once. </p><br><p>  When creating a project in the "Import project" tab, a new option "Manifest file" has appeared as a source for importing your project.  In addition, you can now select individual projects from the list if you do not want to import the entire structure. </p><br><p>  For example, this improvement makes it possible to import code from the <a href="https://source.android.com/">Android Open Source Project (AOSP)</a> .  You can also import other projects whose manifest files fit our <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/import/manifest.html">format requirements</a> . </p><br><p>  <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/import/manifest.html">Documentation on the import of manifests</a> and the <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/28811">original ticket</a> . </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/983/cc3/f75/983cc3f759fc4d807100eb71ed0a8b24.png" alt="Support for Android project import"></p><br><h2 id="sgruppirovannye-po-maylstounam-spiski-na-doske-zadach">  Grouped by Milestone on task board </h2><br><p>  PREMIUM, ULTIMATE, SILVER, GOLD </p><br><p>  Task boards were originally designed to track workflows with lists based on tags.  In the release of GitLab 11.0, we presented <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issue_board.html">lists of performers</a> so that teams could see to whom what tasks were assigned and it was easier to reassign them. </p><br><p>  In this release, we present the third type of list ‚Äî the Mylston task list.  All tasks that belong to this milestone will appear in this list.  Now you can view task lists of different Milestones on one board, as well as quickly move tasks between Milestones.  In this release, the <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/422473/">total weight of tasks in the list</a> also appeared, which, together with the grouping by Milestone, will help teams balance the total weight of tasks between Milestone companies and not take too few or too many tasks. </p><br><p>  We have updated the API, so now you can add and remove lists of any of the three types on a particular board. </p><br><p>  <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issue_board.html">Milestone task list documentation</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/6469">original ticket</a> . </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1e5/415/f4d/1e5415f4d6e250ed7ea763191d1bebc3.png" alt="Issue board milestone lists"></p><br><h2 id="drugie-uluchsheniya-v-gitlab-112">  Other improvements in GitLab 11.2 </h2><br><h3 id="todo-dlya-epikov">  Todo for epic </h3><br><p>  ULTIMATE, GOLD </p><br><p>  The todo list (to do, ‚Äúmake‚Äù) is a convenient built-in tool for increasing personal productivity.  When you are mentioned in a task or a merge request using @, you receive a message in the mail and an item in the todo list in GitLab.  This item can then be marked as completed.  There are many other events that create todo. </p><br><p>  With this release we add todo to epics.  They will work in the same way as in tasks and merge-requests.  When you are mentioned in the epic using @, your todo list is updated with a reminder of this.  When you are viewing an epic, you can create your own todo from the sidebar, as it already works with tasks and merge-requests. </p><br><p>  We also updated the API so that you have access to the epic todo created and can create new ones. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/348/77c/01f/34877c01f24b594eb9b895f9d10407da.png" alt="Todos for epics"></p><br><p>  <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/workflow/todos.html">Documentation on todo</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/5481">original ticket</a> . </p><br><h3 id="summarnyy-ves-spiska-na-doske-zadach">  The total weight of the list on the task board </h3><br><p>  STARTER, PREMIUM, ULTIMATE, BRONZE, SILVER, GOLD </p><br><p>  Before this release, we already showed the number of tasks for each list on the task board.  When you plan a lot and track progress on the task board, it‚Äôs convenient to see how many tasks are in a particular stage of the workflow or assigned to a person in the list of artists. </p><br><p>  With this release we expand this concept and show along with the number of tasks their total weight for each list.  If you move a task to another list to compensate for too low or high weight, the amount is immediately recalculated.  To do this, you do not even have to update the board. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/86d/f66/758/86df66758587849112047e4b60ca462f.png" alt="Summed weights in issue board list"></p><br><p>  <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issue_board.html">Documentation on the total weight of the tasks</a> and the <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/3772">original ticket</a> . </p><br><h3 id="gruppovye-maylstouny-na-paneli-maylstounov">  Group Mailstone on the Mailstone panel </h3><br><p>  CORE, STARTER, PREMIUM, ULTIMATE, FREE, BRONZE, SILVER, GOLD </p><br><p>  The milestones in GitLab are convenient for tracking work in iteration or sprint.  In particular, the group-level Milestone allows you to track tasks from different projects in one place. </p><br><p>  Starting with this release, we show the group milestones in the milestone panel.  This means that users will now be able to see in one place all the Milestones to which they have access - both at the project level and at the group level. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6ea/71c/d55/6ea71cd550df3af6baf67b49945076c9.png" alt="Group milestones on dashboard milestones list page"></p><br><p>  <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/milestones/">Milestone documentation</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/35748">original ticket</a> . </p><br><h3 id="poisk-po-spisku-metok-proekta">  Search by project tag list </h3><br><p>  CORE, STARTER, PREMIUM, ULTIMATE, FREE, BRONZE, SILVER, GOLD </p><br><p>  Labels in GitLab is a flexible feature that allows you to systematize tasks, merge requests and epics.  Teams use them for different purposes and often in projects there are many pages of tags.  When you need to change the name, color or description of the label, you have to scroll through many pages to find the right one. </p><br><p>  In this release, we have simplified this task by adding a tag search directly to the project tag list page.  You can search by name and by label description.  So if you know the name or at least what this label is about, you can quickly find it by keywords in the search field. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/960/a13/ede/960a13ede72380be4485752fb21b5083.png" alt="Search labels in project labels list"></p><br><p>  <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/labels.html">Tagging documentation</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/34837">original ticket</a> . </p><br><h3 id="vse-grafiki-vypolneniya-rabot-dostupny-v-profilyah-gitlab-starter-i-bronze">  All schedules are available in the profiles GitLab Starter and Bronze </h3><br><p>  STARTER, PREMIUM, ULTIMATE, BRONZE, SILVER, GOLD </p><br><p>  Burndown chart - a useful visualization for teams, allowing you to track how work is done on milesstone.  This schedule helps the team assess in advance the risk of meeting deadlines and taking action without waiting for the end of Milestone. </p><br><p>  Previously, the work schedule for the group milestone page was only available in the GitLab Premium and Silver profiles.  Now we add this feature also to the GitLab Starter and Bronze profiles, allowing more users to use it when working with groups.  The schedule for the project's milestones was already available for the Starter and Bronze profiles, so now everything has become even easier. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/223/c52/925/223c5292598f721f932a4fa605117940.png" alt="All burndown charts available in GitLab Starter and GitLab.com Bronze"></p><br><p>  <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/milestones/burndown_charts.html">Documentation of work schedules</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/6251">original ticket</a> . </p><br><h3 id="opovescheniya-dlya-nastraivaemyh-metrik">  Alerts for custom metrics </h3><br><p>  ULTIMATE, GOLD </p><br><p>  GitLab contains a built-in performance monitoring tool that gives engineers a simple and seamless way to track key parameters such as throughput, error rate, and resource consumption.  On the one hand, you need to see these metrics when needed, but if there are problems, it is important to immediately recognize and respond to them. </p><br><p>  In GitLab 11.2, you can create alerts for custom metrics with a few clicks through the metrics panel.  Users can set the desired threshold, and when it is exceeded for 5 minutes, messages will be sent to the owners and those who lead the project.  Support for metrics embedded in GitLab will appear in a <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/6948">future release</a> . </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e8b/a52/485/e8ba52485ba26c5500ed1ed7c4e890b2.png" alt="Service level indicator alerts for custom metrics"></p><br><p>  <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/integrations/prometheus.html">Documentation for setting up alerts for metrics</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/5158">original ticket</a> . </p><br><h3 id="mnozhestvennye-identifikatory-perehodov-jira-pri-zakrytii-tiketov-iz-gitlab">  Jira's multiple transition identifiers when closing tickets from GitLab </h3><br><p>  CORE, STARTER, PREMIUM, ULTIMATE, FREE, BRONZE, SILVER, GOLD </p><br><p>  Many teams using GitLab also use Jira as a tracker.  In GitLab, there is already integration with Jira, which allows GitLab to automatically close the Jira ticket when merging a merge request to GitLab.  To do this, you had to specify the transition ID of the Jira in the GitLab settings, specifying how you want to close the Jira tickets.  But it also meant that you were limited to only one type of transition in Jira. </p><br><p>  Since this release, we have begun to support several transition identifiers in Jira.  This means that if your Jira project is configured in such a way that there are several ways to close the ticket, then GitLab can recognize all of these methods (if you specify them in the settings of the GitLab project), so the GitLab merge quest merge will close the Jira ticket regardless of his condition. </p><br><p>  Thanks <a href="https://gitlab.com/slayercat">lilinzhe</a> for this feature! </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bed/73f/434/bed73f43481db305942d79e8aa6a8fe2.png" alt="Multiple Jira transition IDs for closing Jira issues from GitLab"></p><br><p>  <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/integrations/jira.html">Documentation for integrating GitLab with Jira</a> and the <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/43602">original ticket</a> . </p><br><h3 id="helm-chart-dlya-razvertyvaniya-gitlab-v-oblake-vyshel-v-obschiy-dostup">  Helm Chart to deploy GitLab in the cloud has been shared </h3><br><p>  CORE, STARTER, PREMIUM, ULTIMATE </p><br><p>  We are happy to announce that the <a href="https://helm.sh/">Helm</a> chart for cloud GitLab is now publicly available (GA).
