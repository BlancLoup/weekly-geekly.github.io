  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to accidentally enter the top 15 IT projects for business</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  For two years we have been involved in our side project to improve the effectiveness of telemarketing.  Four times we entered various contests, but did not even go to the shortlist.  Once not passed to the accelerator.  Funds failed twice.  True, once a cool expert said that we correctly assess the market, but he still will not give money. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2eb/12d/027/2eb12d02729242489a843712b6b11bc4.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  For some reason, the market of telemarketing optimization for small and medium businesses is not taken seriously.  Although the effectiveness of telephone communications companies directly affect sales. <br><br>  By the fall of this year, we were already skeptical of any competition, and the <a href="http://digital-summit.ru/awards">‚ÄúDigital Tops‚Äù</a> at first flashed dejectedly into our field of vision.  I would not pay attention to them if one of my friends on Facebook did not publish what will be there to perform.  And next came a mailing from the service Startpack.ru with a recommendation to still try your hand.  We thought, "what if?".

      Time passed, there was no answer (which we were not surprised by, of course), and just before the announcement of the short list in the same Facebook friend I was outraged that neither the answer nor the greeting on the application came and it is not clear whether it was accepted at least.  It turned out the matter is a banal typo - not the mail in the application.  Thanks to the organizers, they then contacted them themselves, the misstep was fixed. <br><br>  Reading the letter ‚ÄúFinalists Selection Results‚Äù a few days later, we opened our mouths when we saw ourselves in the short list, alongside several much more extensive and mature projects, for example, the Human Capital Management system. <br><br>  And so, Moscow, the day of pitches and speeches.  Immediately - awarding nominations.  Here "Tops" gets Bitrix24, here is Megaplan.  My only thought is that I should look confident and interesting to talk about the project.  And now direct competitors.  Well, yes, where we need to be - many tools, large corporate clients, tens of thousands of users, but we must act.  The response to my talk exceeded expectations.  The jury brightened noticeably, asked a couple of questions, and one of the experts said, ‚ÄúDo I need, how much does it cost?‚Äù. <br><br>  Literally ten minutes later, I was already standing on the stage with the statues of ‚ÄúThe Summits‚Äù and did not really understand how this happened.  The jury, as it turned out, didn‚Äôt understand much either and made a decision that was unexpected from the start, even though we didn‚Äôt come up entirely in our target nomination.  ‚ÄúThis is an advance, but you earned it‚Äù - a phrase that now inspires us to new breakthroughs. <br><br>  Why am I doing this: yes, at first glance, a chain of accidents led to success that could not have happened.  But if you dig deeper, everything else was ready to shoot. <br>  There was a specific application product that perfectly solves narrow problems that no one else at the moment solves as easily and efficiently.  There was an understanding that we can write to our real, unique and important advantages.  And of course there were actions - application, presentation, performance.  Do not lose heart, make attempts, do business to be prepared for chance. <br><br>  <b>PS</b> - if you have telemarketing, or not yet, but you need it - go in, try: <a href="http://callhelp.kit-media.com/">http://callhelp.kit-media.com</a> <br><br>  Soon we will lay out even more effective tools, but now you will find benefits for your telemarketing and sales department. <br><br>  And since we have not written yet even once after the merger of Megamind - Habrovchane, what topics on telemarketing and telephone sales are you interested in? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/317538/">https://habr.com/ru/post/317538/</a></p>
