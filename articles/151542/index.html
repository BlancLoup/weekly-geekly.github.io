The main issue of information philosophy</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/014/74b/cd8/01474bcd8412df0d0a3862c2125dc93c.jpg"><br><br>  A huge amount of text was written on the topic of the war of copyright and file sharing.  They argued and swore about it wherever possible.  However, far from everything is said.  Over time, I came to the conclusion that this question is as old as "what comes first - matter or consciousness."  And the more I think about it, the more I am convinced that this is so. <br><br>  Copyright advocates say that this anarchy cannot continue for long, we are about to adopt new, tougher laws, plant the most violent ones, and the rest will get used to it somehow.  Their opponents say that copyright will soon end, because its absurdity is already obvious to everyone.  No one knows who will win this war, or it will last forever, like day and night, but we are witnesses to this.

      How is it that they seem to be right and ready to fight for their ideals?  Both those and others consider the opposite side ‚Äúan insignificant group of dissidents‚Äù, who over time simply must come to their senses.  How can this glaring contradiction be resolved? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  There are 2 main points of view: <br><br>  <b>1. Primary property.</b> <br>  Therefore, anything can be proprietary, and information, and thoughts, and even the rounded corners of the phone.  From this postulate all definitions of copyright, calculations, and conclusions are built.  Adherents of this point of view, it turns out that copyright is a fair law, and ‚Äúpirates‚Äù, and in general, all who somehow exchange information without the permission of ‚Äúits owner‚Äù are criminals. <br><br>  <b>2. Primary information.</b> <br>  Information as the main value of the information world.  Adherents of this viewpoint see that copyright is unnatural law, which is subject to cancellation, or at least serious changes.  Information should be distributed freely, and people who want to earn on ‚Äúintellectual property‚Äù should look for ways to do it without violating the freedom of information. <br><br>  Everything connected with copyright ultimately boils down to one of these two extreme points of view.  It would seem that everything is simple, and at the same time, this is one of those questions in which the deeper you dig, the more everything gets confused.  The number of aspects that can be addressed in this global problem is truly amazing. <br><br>  I will not describe here in detail what information is and what property is, and what it is and what is not.  Let me just say that if you collect all the arguments and counterarguments of both sides in one place, then it seems to me that one could make up one huge tangled block diagram, without an ‚Äúend‚Äù and ‚Äúbeginning‚Äù, which could be argued endlessly .  The parties will never prove anything to each other, they can only recognize the existence of an opposite point of view, and try to build a society in accordance with their balance. <br><br>  I wrote a lot about this in recent years on rutrekera.  Those who read, know what point of view I hold.  I first thought about it in the early 90s, when I myself became the ‚Äúowner of intellectual property,‚Äù namely, I was going to sell the program I had written.  Since then a lot of water has flowed under the bridge, and my attitude to the subject has changed a lot. <br><br>  I grew up at a time when computers were great, and, like all first programmers, I considered any program, melody, picture, game to be a miracle, almost a living creature, which is appropriated and owned, and demanding money for it is sacrilege.  So it was a long time ago, at the beginning, and the impression that today is almost forgotten. <br><br>  We are people who still remember the feeling when you see the first graphic video adapter, the first color monitor, will soon die out as IT dinosaurs, and some say that attitude to information as a value, not as an object of property, will die out with us .  And there will be a society where everyone pulls a blanket over himself, trying to earn some extra dollars or rubles.  But on the other hand, the younger generations that grow in the world, penetrated by technologies, where information becomes as natural as air, form a new attitude to the subject.  Therefore, it seems to me that it is still unknown how the future will develop, and I will try as much as I can to translate and publish information about it here. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/151542/">https://habr.com/ru/post/151542/</a></p>
