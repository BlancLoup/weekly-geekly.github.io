  <section class="page js-page"><h1>IoT standards, networks, three tables</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The subject of the Internet of Things has previously slipped at RIT ++ and HighLoad ++ conferences, but usually with a focus on the usual data storage or programming issues.  But last year we decided that it was time to seriously discuss IoT: hardware, data networks, industrial applications, and held the first <a href="https://youtu.be/Cns_pqejk9g%3Flist%3DPLLou2AJA-1dIZNyIIzxnQlHqAcL0pCMwc">InoThings ++ 2018 conference</a> . <br><br>  According to the participants, we realized that we need not just a conference on the Internet of things - there are already a lot of them - the community needs an event completely free from marketing and stories about bright horizons, but aimed at solving problems of real projects. <br><br>  InoThings ++ 2018 showed that expectations were justified, the event was 5 points out of 5. How it was, look and read <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/oleg-bunin/blog/440706/">in the article by Oleg Artamonov</a> , the head of the program committee and a participant in all events.  This year, already <b>on April 4</b> , we will do even better.  Our speakers are exclusively practitioners, and in the program only important topics.  What exactly, read under the cut.

This year there will be even more practitioners: technical directors of leading companies and telecom corporations, leading analysts, experts, doctors of science, heads of laboratories and government representatives.  From regalia dizzy, so we will not list all.  Just come to the conference - see for yourself. <br><br><h2>  IoT in practice </h2><br>  The general idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe whole event is the <b>Internet of things in practice</b> : the practice of implementing IoT projects at the level of telecom operators, integrators, end customers and developers.  Accordingly, we will discuss everything on IoT and around: devices, software, testing, cryptography, protocols, business and legal aspects.  Geyser Telecom, PVS Studio, Contactless, Sierra Wireless, GoodWAN, Samsung Electronics, Lartech and many others will arrive. <br><br>  <b>20 reports</b> and <b>3 round tables are</b> scheduled for InoThings ++ from 10 to 19 hours.  The program is as dense as parking in a residential area, but we promise respite - extra time and breaks.  The reports will be held in three halls: in large, medium and small.  In large - 6 reports, in the rest - 7 each. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/696/bf5/460/696bf54603f1d518469afc8fa4c068e4.jpg"><br>  <i>Interactive version of the schedule <a href="https://inothings.ru/2019/schedule.html">here</a> .</i> <br><br>  The interestingness of the speeches does not depend on the size of the room, but the topic depends.  Thematically, the Program Committee divided the conference into three parts.  Three multi-colored tracks are three themes: <b>standards and state regulation, project implementation and the development of devices and systems</b> .  Each part has its own theme color on the <a href="http://inothings.ru/2019/schedule.html">schedule</a> . <br><br>  One round table was planned for each hall to discuss the pain points in IoT, get expert opinion and talk to the speakers - prepare questions.  About the round tables later, but for now let's go through the topics of reports, which are conventionally divided into <b>6 blocks</b> . <br><br><h2>  InoThings ++ in blocks </h2><br>  In the <b>Security and Cryptography</b> block we will talk about authentication and threats.  Why traditional methods are vulnerable to attacks and are not particularly convenient in deployment.  We will discuss the main threats to IoT devices, scenarios of confronting them, why <b>cryptography in IoT is inevitable</b> and how to ensure the security of the entire IoT through legal regulation, regulations and industry expert associations. <br><br>  Technology is ahead of regulation.  While relative vacuum reigns in IoT, there are few norms, restrictions and attention from regulators.  Soon it will end.  In the <b>‚ÄúLegal Aspect‚Äù</b> block we will talk about what norms, restrictions and standards exist, what should be in the Russian Federation, what are in the world and how not to quarrel with the state, using IoT. <br><br>  In the block <b>‚ÄúData Transmission Networks, Protocols, Radio Communication‚Äù there are</b> two reports and they are related to LPWAN: classification, problems, opportunities, review of solutions, power.  About the power in more detail in the next block <b>"Hardware"</b> .  It has only <a href="http://inothings.ru/2019/abstracts/4597">one report</a> , but what is - <b>‚ÄúProper nutrition is the key to a long and successful operation of electronic devices</b> . <b>‚Äù</b>  Overview of the external conditions to which attention is paid when designing and about a set of internal criteria: efficiency, power, dimensions. <br><br>  There are 5 reports in the <b>‚ÄúSoftware‚Äù</b> block: from the choice of a programming language to the choice between a remote and a full-time team. <br><br><ul><li>  Design <a href="http://inothings.ru/2019/abstracts/4383">another control system</a> . <br></li><li>  How <a href="http://inothings.ru/2019/abstracts/4692">to write a quality code in C</a> , and then <a href="http://inothings.ru/2019/abstracts/4832">go to Rust</a> . <br></li><li>  How to organize <a href="http://inothings.ru/2019/abstracts/4937">remote development</a> for IoT and not to rush into fire. <br></li><li>  Difficulties and deprivation of <a href="http://inothings.ru/2019/abstracts/4953">development for industrial operation</a> . <br></li></ul><br>  The <b>IOT in Business</b> unit is the largest - with 6 reports.  Let's start with satellite IoT, move on to examples of IoT in Air Telecom and unusual cases of using LoRa, learn how to create something useful for business and educate personnel, well, let's end with the traditional salvation of the planet.  Everything we love. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e45/f71/daf/e45f71daf963ec71137c5b777d744f9f.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Round tables </h2><br>  Each round table is tied to one of the blocks, but we will tell about them separately.  <a href="http://inothings.ru/2019/abstracts/5054">The first table</a> is, in principle, the <b>first discussion in Russia of state participation in the IoT market.</b>  All interested parties will be present: developers, companies and the state.  <b>Oleg Artamonov</b> spoke <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/oleg-bunin/blog/442696/">in</a> detail about the event <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/oleg-bunin/blog/442696/">in a separate article</a> : the background to the issue, the motives for organizing a large-scale public discussion and a long-long list of experts and values ‚Äã‚Äãin the IoT environment, from doctors of technical sciences to directors of telecom corporations. <br><br>  The second <b>is <a href="http://inothings.ru/2019/abstracts/5055">about a paradigm shift</a></b> : why the classic approach to supply ready-made equipment and standard communication services does not work, <b>who is to blame and what to do</b> .  Sibintek, Geyser Telecom, MTS, Concern Goodwin are participating. <br><br>  The third table is <a href="http://inothings.ru/2019/abstracts/5056"><b>about microelectronics</b></a> .  About domestic microelectronics and its prospects.  The round table has not been finalized yet, but preliminarily there will be Baikal Electronics and SPC Elvis. <br><br>  Tables with each other do not overlap, so you can have time for all the experts to ask tricky questions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0f8/8ad/766/0f88ad766f25e342e9e6dd8ed395ff46.jpg"><br><br><blockquote>  A few days left <a href="https://inothings.ru/2019">before the InoThings ++</a> developer conference.  The program is ready, the schedule has been finalized, the badges have been printed, the coffee has been crushed, we are only waiting for you.  See you! </blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/445742/">https://habr.com/ru/post/445742/</a></p>
