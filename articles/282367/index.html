      The book will open up new perspectives for you and allow you to deal with the new technologies and skills that are in demand today to develop, implement, optimize and use virtualized infrastructures, as well as manage them in order to achieve the benefits that business can get from using cloud technologies. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  For two short years since the publication of the first edition of the book, the world known to us has undergone incredible changes.  We live in an era of digital technology, when the amount of information available in the world more than doubles in two years, and in the next decade, IT departments will have to cope with information volumes that have increased more than 50 times, and this is despite the fact that the field of information technology will increase only one and a half times (according to a report submitted in June 2011 by IDC Research Company ‚ÄúDigital Universe Study‚Äù, which was sponsored by EMC).  Now virtualization and cloud computing for enterprises is no longer just one of the possible options, but an imperative condition for market survival.  And the so-called big data provides organizations with new, very effective capabilities for analyzing, processing and managing the increased volume of their most valuable asset - information and the acquisition of significant competitive advantages. <br><br>  As a result of all this, the information technology industry is undergoing tremendous changes.  With the advent of cloud computing, completely new technologies, computer models and disciplines have emerged, which have greatly changed the methods of building and launching information technologies, as well as their management.  To keep up with these transformations, new specialties were introduced, such as a technologist and cloud architect.  Organizations working in the field of information technologies have evolved from infrastructure operators of the operations department, performing the task of maintaining equipment operability, into key strategic figures of business organization with a specialization in the provision of information technologies in the form of services. <br><br>  All these changes required new key skills in the IT organization, a new way of technological thinking in the context of business requirements and strategic goals, and even a new organizational structure of the data center.  Professionals in the field of information storage and management should replenish their existing knowledge and develop additional skills in the field of those technologies that play the most important role in successfully mastering the complex long-term path to the cloud, that is, to master, in particular, virtualization, converged networks, information technology security, data protection, and charging for data storage and analysis services. <br><br>  We reworked this book to open up new perspectives for you and to give insights into the new technologies and skills that are in demand today for developing, implementing, optimizing and using virtualized infrastructures and managing them in order to achieve the benefits that a business can get from the application of cloud technologies.  You will learn on the basis of the knowledge that EMC's highly qualified specialists with the most extensive experience in training, certification of specialists and practical work in this industry will share with you. <br><br>  Whoever you are - a professional in the field of information storage and management, who are in the process of virtualizing their data center or creating a reliable cloud infrastructure, or as an ordinary person interested in learning the concepts and principles of new paradigms - have not yet improved your skills of similar importance.  By speeding up the process of self-improvement with the help of this book and taking advantage of the training and passing of the qualification certification that is already available to you, you can help to close the critical shortage of qualified specialists in the information industry, get the opportunity for career growth and begin to fully contribute to the successful expansion of your company and achieving high levels of stability and profitability. <br><br>  There are still enough problems in this area, but in your affairs you will be rewarded.  Nelson Mandela once said: ‚ÄúEducation is the most powerful weapon with which you can change the world.‚Äù  I hope that this book will become one of the main sources of your IT education and professional development, regardless of the role you are in at the moment, and that you will certainly take the opportunity to change yourself and help change this world for the better. <br><br><h5>  Introduction </h5><br>  Information storage is the most important component of information technology.  Every moment, individuals and organizations create huge amounts of digital information that needs to be preserved, protected, optimized and managed in a classic, virtualized and rapidly evolving cloud environment. <br><br>  Not so long ago, information storages were presented only in the form of drives on magnetic disks or tapes connected to a computer for the purpose of storing data.  Even today, the most important role that storage technology plays in achieving high levels of availability, performance, integration and optimization of the entire IT infrastructure is understood only by experts in the field of data storage.  Over the past decade, information storage has evolved into a highly sophisticated technology that provides a variety of digital information solutions related to storing, managing, connecting, protecting, securing, sharing and optimizing. <br><br>  The widespread adoption of virtualization, the emergence of cloud computing, multiple annual growth in data volumes and the availability of diverse <br>  Types and sources of data - all of these factors have made modern data storage technologies even more important and relevant for the success of both commercial and any other organizations.  The most acutely compared with the previous times, the leaders of the IT industry faced the problem of hiring and training highly qualified technical specialists in the field of data storage, well-versed in the work of classical, virtualized and cloud environments. <br><br>  Many leading universities and colleges now include courses on studying data storage technologies in their programs for studying ordinary computer or information technologies, since until now IT professionals, even those with many years of experience, have not received any significant formal training benefits.  Therefore, many experienced professionals, including application, system, database and network administrators, do not have a common opinion about the impact of data storage technology on their business lines. <br><br>  This book was conceived and designed to help professionals and students gain a deep understanding of all the components of data storage technology.  Although the industrial design examples used in this book are related to EMC Corporation products, an understanding of technological concepts and principles will prepare you for easy mastery of technical products from various suppliers. <br><br>  The book contains 15 chapters, summarized in five sections.  Topics are set out by increasing the complexity of the material, all subsequent topics should be studied after mastering the previous ones.  Section I introduces the concepts of virtualization and cloud infrastructure, which are then referred to throughout the book to ensure that storage technologies are considered in the context of a traditional or classic environment, a virtualized environment, and a rapidly evolving cloud environment. <br><br>  <b>Section I "Storage Systems"</b> .  The four chapters of this section deal with the problems of the information boom and changes in the nature of the stored information, provide definitions for the data storage system and data center environment, provide an overview of the development of data storage technology, and provide an introduction to intelligent data storage systems.  In addition, this section introduces the concepts of virtualization and cloud computing. <br><br>  <b>Section II "Network Storage Technology"</b> .  The four chapters of this section deal with the storage network based on the use of fiber optic technology - Fiber Channel storage area network (FC-SAN), the storage network based on the use of the Internet Protocol - Internet Protocol SAN (IP SAN), network storage devices - Network -attached storage (NAS), object-based storage technology and unified data storage.  In addition, the section discusses the concepts of storage associations and converged networks (FCoE). <br><br>  <b>Section III, ‚ÄúBackup, Archiving, and Replication</b> . <b>‚Äù</b>  The four chapters of this section deal with business continuity, data backup and recovery, data deduplication, data archiving, local and remote data replication in both classical and virtualized environments. <br><br>  <b>Section IV "Cloud Computing"</b> .  The only chapter in this section discusses cloud computing, including its infrastructure, service models, deployment options, and the factors that determine how to move to cloud computing. <br><br>  <b>Section V, "Security and Storage Infrastructure Management"</b> .  Two chapters of this section deal with the security of the storage infrastructure, the monitoring of the infrastructure, and the management of this infrastructure, including security and management issues in virtualized and cloud environments. <br><br><h5>  About editors </h5><br>  <b>Gnanasundaram Somasundaram</b> (Somasundaram Gnanasundaram), or Soma (Somu), is the director of EMC's Department of Educational Services ‚Äî EMC Education Services, the leading global system for training specialists in practical work in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe company's interests.
