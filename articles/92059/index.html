  <section class="page js-page"><h1>50 more ways to spend the summer</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img align="left" src="http://software.intel.com/ru-ru/blogs/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/summer_school.png">  Judging by the success of <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/google/88691/">Habratopik</a> on internship at Google, this topic is very relevant and like the users.  By the way, by comparing <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/google/88691/">these</a> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/google/90301/">two</a> posts, we can draw another conclusion: the users at large like those posts where <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/google/90301/">there are a lot of</a> pictures.  I also insert the picture, as without it ... Only one and above the habrakat.  And we will use the free space from illustrations for their intended purpose: let's talk about what interesting things Intel has for those who want to practice programming this summer. <br><br>  I will not philosophize about the pros and cons of different approaches to hiring employees, but Intel's technical teams, as a rule, choose their own candidates.  And interns are no exception.  In other words, practical experience in certain areas is appreciated, or, at least, a fervent desire for such experience.  That is, the candidate‚Äôs task actually comes down to searching in the list of internship assignments for a topic that would be of interest to himself. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  ... But before you publish the entire list, it makes sense to make a small digression about the internship program.  Intel has 5 development centers in Russia, and they are located in the cities of Moscow, Nizhny Novgorod, Novosibirsk, St. Petersburg and Sarov (cities are listed in alphabetical order so as not to offend anyone). 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      Each center has its own specialization and its key projects.  For example, in Moscow and Novosibirsk, they are engaged in compilers, in Sarov - in mathematical libraries and codecs, in Nizhny - in optimization tools, parallel computing and graphics.  Intel technical teams consist of an average of a dozen engineers and take one or two students or graduate students for summer practice.  Each intern is attached to the so-called "mentor", and if in Russian - the curator.  The curators introduce their interns in the course of the case, introduce them to the team, their field of activity, a specific task, and so on.  But this is after a particular candidate has been selected from the general list of applicants.  And in order to choose a candidate, you must first decide what to do with it then.  And believe me, it seems to be a matter of minutes only at first glance! <br><br>  After all, you need to pick up a task in such a way that it brings practical benefits to the project, would not be too complicated and at the same time - too routine, solved in a month or two and a half, and most importantly - would be interesting. <br><br>  Our engineers came up with tasks for almost a month.  And they came up with almost 50 pieces.  I will give here a few for the seed (the links are a detailed version of the text), and the full list can be found <a href="http://software.intel.com/ru-ru/articles/summer-school-2010-main/">on this page</a> . <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://software.intel.com/ru-ru/articles/summer-school-2010-tasks-nnov/">Optimization of a parallel fluid simulation application and various effects in it</a> . </li><li>  <a href="http://software.intel.com/ru-ru/articles/summer-school-2010-tasks-nnov/">Analysis of the performance of modern models of parallel programming in problems of financial mathematics</a> . </li><li>  <a href="http://software.intel.com/ru-ru/articles/summer-school-2010-tasks-nnov/">A study of the new functionality of the SAP CRM system 7.0</a> . </li><li>  <a href="http://software.intel.com/ru-ru/articles/summer-school-2010-tasks-nnov/">Exploring the architectural approach of CQRS to create business applications</a> . </li><li>  <a href="http://software.intel.com/ru-ru/articles/summer-school-2010-tasks-nnov/">The user interface of your dreams</a> . </li><li>  <a href="http://software.intel.com/ru-ru/articles/summer-school-2010-tasks-nnov/">Approximation of the ‚Äúglobal illumination‚Äù phenomenon for dynamic scenes</a> . </li><li>  <a href="http://software.intel.com/ru-ru/articles/summer-school-2010-tasks-nnov/">Implementation of the collision resolution procedure taking into account the real-time collisions for a particle system</a> . </li><li>  <a href="http://software.intel.com/ru-ru/articles/summer-school-2010-tasks-nnov/">Smoke and fluid dynamics: a second-order particle system for advection of procedurally generated vortices</a> . </li><li>  <a href="http://software.intel.com/ru-ru/articles/summer-school-2010-tasks-spb/">Designing a cryptographic accelerator</a> . </li><li>  <a href="http://software.intel.com/ru-ru/articles/summer-school-2010-tasks-novo/">The study of the influence of "managed runtime environment (MRTE)" on the example of Java and C # on the performance of Intel Math Kernel Library</a> . </li><li>  <a href="http://software.intel.com/ru-ru/articles/summer-school-2010-tasks-novo/">Adaptation of the GCC vectorizer for the command system of new Intel processors</a> . </li><li>  <a href="http://software.intel.com/ru-ru/articles/summer-school-2010-tasks-sarov/">Development of Reed-Solomon Kodak based on ippDI functionality</a> . </li></ul><br>  Our practice is traditionally called the ‚ÄúSummer School‚Äù, and the interns are called ‚Äúsummer schoolchildren‚Äù.  This year the school will be quite large-scale: it is expected to recruit about 60 people, and all 5 Intel offices in Russia participate in the program.  How will it look like?  It's <a href="http://software.intel.com/ru-ru/articles/summer-school-2010-main/">very simple</a> : those who want to see the tasks of the office that is geographically closer.  Choose from the list one or two puzzles.  Fill out the form and send it to where it should be.  Then, specially trained people will select the most-most from the pile of questionnaires, after which the authors of these most-most will be sent personal invitations to participate in the internship program "Summer School Intel 2010".  To be precise, it will happen on June 4-5. <br><br>  And then ... And then the work itself will begin.  And study.  And much more.  As you know, Habr is not a place for copy-pastors, so I put a link to the sentimental memories (already <a href="http://software.intel.com/ru-ru/blogs/2010/04/26/intel-summer-school-3/">in three parts</a> ) of the former summer schoolboy, and now - Intel consulting engineer Cyril Mavrodiyev. <br><br>  I give one more <a href="http://software.intel.com/ru-ru/articles/contest-summer-school-2009-entries/">link to</a> those who prefer physics to lyrics - these are fairly detailed reports on several projects of last year‚Äôs summer school. <br><br>  Finally, I would like to conduct a small sociological experiment: I recently received a letter from a habrachelok for habrapmail, which, as it turned out, was also once an intern at Intel.  Exclusively from the interests of studying the <strike>demographic situation of</strike> statistics: please Habrap users who have ever participated in Intel summer schools, leave in the comments the year and city of their internship.  Thank you in advance! <br><br>  All bored summer! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/92059/">https://habr.com/ru/post/92059/</a></p>
