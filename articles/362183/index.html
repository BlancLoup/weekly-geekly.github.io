We have already <a href="https://habr.com/company/abbyy/blog/123518/">talked</a> about what ‚ÄúDialogue‚Äù is and why ABBYY is its main organizer.  In this post, we announce the main topics of the conference, key speakers and their presentations, publish information about competitions on resolving lexical ambiguity in Russian, Dialogue Evaluation, and other details about the conference. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  This year the main topics of the ‚ÄúDialogue‚Äù will be: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Linguistic interpretation of the results of deep machine learning ("black boxes").</b>  The principal feature of today's incredibly popular multilayer neural networks is that few people understand what factors actually influenced the outcome of their work.  They are a kind of "black boxes".  On the one hand, it gives rise to some pessimism among some linguists about the prospects of their science, and on the other, makes us think about the possibility of using deep learning for linguistic research proper and about a meaningful interpretation of its results.  Perhaps this understanding will help improve the work of the neural networks themselves. </li><li>  <b>Methods of applying big data analysis technologies to tasks for which such data is not enough.</b>  It is no secret that for many text analytics tasks it is very difficult to find adequate training datasets.  And I want to solve them.  There are different approaches to this problem, from automatic generation of training data to technologies for transferring deep learning results from tasks where there is a lot of data, to tasks where there is not enough (so-called TransferLearning). </li><li>  <b>Multimodal communication.</b>  This is the study of all spheres of speech act, language, intonation, facial expressions and gestures, emotional and communicative behavior.  The conference will discuss new results and their practical application, for example, for dialogue agents or robots. </li></ul><br>  In the "Dialogue" will be attended by well-known <b>experts in computational linguistics</b> :

      <a href="https://www.inf.uni-hamburg.de/en/inst/ab/lt/people/alexander-panchenko.html">Alexander Panchenko</a> from the University of Hamburg (Germany).  This young Russian scientist successfully deals with problems in the field of computer lexical semantics.  His invited report is devoted to linguistic interpretation of the results of deep learning, May 31, Thursday, 15: 30-16: 40. <br><br>  <a href="http://iling-ran.ru/main/scholars/kibrik">Andrei Kibrik</a> , Director of the Institute of Linguistics of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Professor of Moscow State University.  He will make a report (together with a senior researcher at the Laboratory of Cognitive Studies of the Faculty of Psychology, ION RANEPA, Olga Fedorova) on the interaction of the processes of generation and understanding in face-to-face multimodal communication, May 30, Wednesday, 11: 30-13: 00 . <br><br>  <a href="http://corpus.leeds.ac.uk/serge/">Sergey Sharov</a> , Professor, Department of Translation Studies, University of Leeds (UK).  One of the most authoritative experts in the world in the field of online text analysis.  At the conference, he will talk about experiments using machine translation for the tasks of multilingual genre classification of texts, June 1, Friday, 10: 30-13: 30. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.vai.dia.fi.upm.es/ing/cv/igor_cv.htm">Igor Boguslavsky</a> , a professor at the Madrid University of Technology and head of the Laboratory of Computational Linguistics at the IITP RAS, one of the largest specialists in ontological semantics.
