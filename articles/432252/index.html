  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to earn more in the IT sector in Russia?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In this article, I decided to conduct a review of how to live a programmer in Siberia, namely in Novosibirsk.  Because not everyone is ready and, frankly, they want to go to Moscow or St. Petersburg.  Abroad, too, the decision is not for everyone, at home and the earth helps, as they say.  Not everyone is ready to leave their homelands and families for the sake of the laurels of Google and Silicon Valley.  Therefore, the idea was born to search and see what options exist for young and more advanced programmers to implement and make money in their hometown.  The more I searched and looked, the more I realized that the material goes beyond the borders of my native land, so now it's more objective to say how to make more money for a programmer in Russia as a whole. <br><br><h3>  Internet, technology and freelance </h3><br>  It seems to me that now generally you can not go anywhere.  Remote work and freelancing is now extremely common among representatives of the IT professions.  Because everything that you need is in your head.  Meetings via Skype or other messengers allow you to supervise projects, work and even study.  In a global world in fact there are no borders.  For an IT specialist, there is an option to keep your lifestyle, stay close to your loved ones and work all over the world.  One moment, these are time zones, but you can come up with something. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  High-tech domestic clusters </h3><br>  Work in high-tech domestic clusters.  No need to go far, a great opportunity for beginners and progressive IT-specialists can Research and Production Cluster "Siberian science of nurses."  I would say that this is the pride of our Novosibirsk region, which in itself has united all sources of bright thought in Novosibirsk: Academpark, Koltsovo Biotechnopark, Medtechnopark and Industrial Medical Park.  Therefore, Naukopolis combines several activities of IT and high-tech medicine, biotechnology and biopharmaceuticals.  The structure, of course, is more zamorochennaya, but it is worth it.  By the way, many members of the IT cluster are also members of NP SibacademSoft, a non-profit organization that, in fact, oversees the entire cluster. <br><br>  In general, we have many such clusters in Russia, different in orientation, based on the specifics of the production of a particular region.  In 2016, the Ministry of Economic Development of the Russian Federation launched a global program for the development of innovative clusters throughout Russia.  The level of development of each individual cluster needs to be looked at separately: somewhere it is still a project of the project (for example, Krasnoyarsk cluster ‚ÄúYenisei‚Äù, which exists on paper since 2011), and somewhere it is a working project implemented.  Therefore, my list is more for understanding where they are located, but not for the conclusions that they are equally well developed in every region:

Dozens of factories and industries that require IT specialists work in Novosibirsk and the Novosibirsk Region.  This is a great opportunity to become a narrow and sought-after specialist in the field of automation, etc.  I looked at HeadHunter gj for the request ‚ÄúIT-specialist‚Äù there were 194 vacancies, on the Rabota.ru website with inquiries it was a little more difficult and the results showed not such a wealth of vacancies of only 73 pieces. <br><br>  But you should not despair if there are no suitable vacancies near you right now.  In fact, progress is proceeding rather quickly, even into bulky factory structures.  Some of my acquaintances have found a good position in the quality of management of building production automation systems.  Although yesterday this work unit was not.  Therefore, you need to monitor the markets and be ready! <br><br><h3>  How to find a permanent job and growth? </h3><br>  From my own experience and the practice of my friends and acquaintances, I can say that 80% of IT people periodically ‚Äúwork‚Äù: temporary projects for part-time work, permanent remote projects are not full time.  This allows you to increase your income and your skills to develop.  Here to help, both domestic stock exchanges, and foreign, depending on your specialization.  Made a selection of some, in my subjective opinion, <br><br>  1. Upwork.com (the largest international stock exchange) <br>  2. Free-lancers.net (programming + design) <br>  3. Freelansim.ru <br>  4. Devhuman.com <br>  5. Modber.ru and 1clancer.ru (mostly 1C) <br>  6. Weblancer.net <br>  7. Workspace.ru <br>  8. Bigxp.ru (not free consultations, but for me this service is quite questionable) <br><br><h3>  What else you need to know to earn more? </h3><br>  No matter how it sounds unpatriotic, but the presence of "paper" from foreign universities or prof.  organizations are always a significant bonus for an applicant for any position in IT.  Therefore, online self-education is already a solution for working professionals or for those who already understand what narrow specialization they need to get.  Here everyone can be assisted either by online universities or universities that have developed online education at a steep level.  I give my personal selection of foreign educational institutions, which are worth paying attention to IT-specialists: <br><br>  1. <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a> <br>  2. <a href="https://online.stanford.edu/courses">Stanford</a> <br>  3. <a href="http://ocw.usu.edu/education/index.html">Kutztown University of Pennsylvania</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/432252/">https://habr.com/ru/post/432252/</a></p>
