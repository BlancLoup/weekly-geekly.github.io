  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Information in 2007</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  At the end of last year, there was a decline in interest in blogs of a general orientation and just Internet diaries against the background of a strongly increased number of these blogs.  The discovery of various blog services and the natural interest of the community are doing their dirty deed - users are starting to produce their blogs.  Produce without goals and ideas.  Does everyone have?  And I will have! <br><br>  Needless to say that this process reduces the quality of the content provided in general?  And what is the search for the necessary and, most importantly, suddenly necessary information?  Yes, quite a long time ago, a very successful means appeared to contain and structure this boiling chaos of public consciousness - search engines by tags.  With a rather successful collaboration of bloggers and tag services, all public knowledge was very flexibly classified into various categories.  Anyone reappearing on the Internet was immediately assigned their own category.  It would seem that now the search for information was a solid honey.  But the situation did not last long. <br><br>  Tags by tags, and the information became more and more, and the community of the whole system began to crumble, the specifics and the certainty of the search for information began to spread.  Now, to find all the information on the desired topic, it was not enough to conduct a search directly on it, it became necessary to filter out the results according to additional criteria.  It became clear that you need to think through new systems for searching and structuring information from blogs and information resources.

      To track updates on blogs, different feed technologies are used to convey information to the user: Atom, RSS, RDF.  They work properly, each has pros and cons, but they are transparent to the user and he usually does not think about choosing one format or another.  Problems begin when more than 50 or 100 different feeds populate the user‚Äôs feed.  If the news aggregator is a program, then this is channel blocking and waste of traffic.  The situation is somewhat easier with online aggregators, but the increasing inconvenience of operating with ribbons remains.  This year there will be services (if they have not already appeared), which will allow to accumulate various tapes into single thematic flows, as well as to carry out various operations with these flows. <br><br>  In order to preserve the sound integrity of the Internet, finally, decisive steps towards the semantic web are necessary.  Let me remind you that the main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe semantic web is to create such a structure of information that will be understandable to computers.  Microformats (mf) are one of the means to achieve this goal.  The widespread implementation of mf is hampered by a lack of understanding by society of their value.  This assumption will be corrected by new extended mf and services operating with them.  After that, the general introduction of mf into services and software will immediately begin. <br><br>  Here are just a few things that I think we will see in the new 2007. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4910/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4910/</a></p>
