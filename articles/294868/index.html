Many companies have bothered to advance their products and services on these dates, with holiday symbols appearing in promotional materials long before the holidays themselves.  "Holiday" advertising is really necessary to run in advance, long before the holidays.  And every year the "New Year" advertising campaigns start earlier. <br><br>  In this matter, buyers are fully agree with advertisers.  The study from Outbrain shows that buyers expect the appearance of advertising content with holiday symbols long before the holiday itself.  This applies not only to Christmas and New Years, but also to Black Friday or Cyber ‚Äã‚ÄãMonday, which are perceived by customers as holidays.  Under the cut - a diagram that demonstrates the validity of all the above. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/bd2/d87/2b9/bd2d872b9e389ebeef119ca7fd5cbad7.jpg"><br>  <i>Consumption of holiday content (clicks) in November 2014</i>

      Since November, the number of clicks on advertising content, which is associated with the holidays, has increased dramatically.  At the same time, the amount of this kind of content remains approximately at the same level since November, slightly increasing in December and January. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/16e/984/77b/16e98477b8d6dd52d03f08c107852af8.jpg"><br>  Amount of holiday content (paid links) <br><br>  The study was conducted in Western markets, mainly in the English segment of the Network.  Therefore, the keywords that users pay most attention to are relevant (egg, cookie, eat, snack, tasty, baby, secret). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/eab/2f6/4a9/eab2f64a9b512881edef4f058db678c4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Why are promotional materials related to New Year and Christmas so popular?  The answer is simple - the reason is that the holidays and everything connected with them cause a person to have positive emotions.  Accordingly, even relatively aggressive advertising, which demonstrates holiday symbols, causes positive emotions among users who see this advertisement.  ‚ÄúHoliday symbols‚Äù are Christmas trees, stars, patterns, Santa Claus, gifts, chocolate, tangerines (from a domestic user) and all that jazz. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/949/2e5/9ab/9492e59ab99394cdd38fde493d3e2814.jpg"><br>  <i>An example of effective holiday advertising</i> <br><br>  The most effective advertising, which looks like a greeting, it causes extremely warm emotions.  The best work materials, where combined festive content with an indication of what the advertiser offers.  As an example of advertising of games, there are ideally suited materials where elements of a holiday and elements of the game itself are combined.  Moreover, the user's emotions are important, but it is even more important to provoke the user to click on the advertisement.  And it‚Äôs best to do this by filling out promotional material in a ‚Äúgift‚Äù style. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/bd0/d3a/755/bd0d3a755cde3d24862403d469a6563d.png" width="750"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/b43/f6e/877/b43f6e877c13efd9d5eb4e9822466f8f.jpg" width="750"><br><br>  The images above are an example of optimal promotional materials for mobile devices.  Such materials perfectly attract the user who clicks on such advertising better than any other.  Images are quite different, but they also have common elements: <br><ul><li>  The company logo is located in the upper left corner or in the middle of advertising material; </li><li>  The festive symbolism here is represented by gifts, snow, sparks, Christmas tree.  Holiday allusion; </li><li>  Bright colours; </li><li>  Contrast colors as a call to action; </li><li>  Relevant background (snow, fireworks, etc.); </li><li>  A clear demonstration of what is offered (for example, advertising gambling with money). </li></ul><br><br>  <b>Conclusion</b> <br><br>  A few pre-holiday weeks are a great chance for an advertiser to promote their product or service using holiday symbols.  And for the owner of the mobile application, the publisher - an occasion to think about choosing a reliable platform for monetization.  There is still time to think about your advertising strategy, or to think about the best way to place mobile advertising in your application.
