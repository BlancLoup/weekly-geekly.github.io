    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>How did you get into Ruby development?</b> <br><br>  While working on my <a href="http://www.iiia.csic.es/~claudio/">thesis,</a> I decided to make web radio to study machine learning on the example of musical preferences.  The first version was on Perl and PHP, the code was a real dump.  By chance, I found a book on Rails in the library, read it on the way home, and the next day I decided to rewrite the radio in Ruby.  It took two weeks, and ... I never returned to Perl and PHP! <br><br>  During my Ph.D.  Artificial Intelligence.  It was a big mess.  By chance, I‚Äôve decided to re-write the online radio in Ruby.  It took me two weeks and ... I never went back to Perl or PHP! <br><br><br>  <b>What are you working on now?</b> <br><br>  I work in <a href="http://www.fullscreen.com/">Fullscreen</a> , helping content producers and brands make money on YouTube.  In particular, I built <a href="https://www.channelpl.us/sessions/new">Channel +</a> - a website to optimize your presence on YouTube.  Access to the site is limited, but you can get an idea from this <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/claudiob/good-enough-web-design">presentation</a> . <br><br>  I'm working at fullscreen talents and brands make money on youtube.  Specifically, I built Channel + - a website used by talent and sales coordinators to optimize YouTube presence.  Although this website is restricted, you can get a sneak peek in this presentation. <br><br><br>  <b>Favorite programming language after Ruby, why him?</b> <br><br>  There's no such thing.  Seriously.  I recently made <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/channel%2B-by-fullscreen/id977771271%3Fmt%3D8">an iPhone app</a> , and I'm proud of it ... but every time I open Xcode and look at the Swift code, I‚Äôm horrified.  Ruby is the only language with which I remain focused and happy for hours. <br><br>  None.  I'm serious.  I‚Äôve recently built an iPhone app.  I love you for hours. <br><br><br>  <b>What is open source for you?</b> <br><br>  Open Source is the blood of programming.  The subject of envy of representatives of any other professions.  Only programmers encourage open sharing of their findings and technical achievements with colleagues.  Doctors, producers, investors, jugglers ... they all show only the ‚Äúfinal product‚Äù, but they are not allowed to reveal their ‚Äúsecrets‚Äù. <br>  Open Source enriches us all.  We learn by reading real code written by outstanding professionals, and we learn to repay.  I am very grateful to Fullscreen for permission to release three Open Source projects for the last year: <a href="http://fullscreen.github.io/bh/">Bh</a> (Bootstrap Helpers), <a href="http://fullscreen.github.io/yt/">Yt</a> (YouTube API client) and <a href="https://github.com/fullscreen/squid">Squid</a> (a library for drawing graphs in PDF). <br><br>  Open Source is the blood of computer programming.  This is an envy of any other profession.  Only programmers are encouraged to meet their peers.  Doctors, producers, investors, magicians ... they can only show the "final product". <br>  Open source enriches us all.  We learn to give back.  I‚Äôm very thankful for the last year: Bh (Bootstrap Helpers), Yt (YouTube API client), and Squid (a bit for a plot of charts in PDF files). <br><br><br>  <b>Favorite blogs / websites / twitter on web development and programming?</b> <br><br>  I watch the video <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/Confreaks/videos">Confreaks</a> , read the blog <a href="https://signalvnoise.com/">Signal vs.</a>  <a href="https://signalvnoise.com/">noise</a> and listen to the <a href="http://bikeshed.fm/">Bikeshed</a> podcast. <br><br>  I watch the Confreaks videos, I read the Signal vs.  listen to the bikeshed podcast. <br><br><br>  <b>What advice would you give to developers who want to achieve great success?</b> <br><br>  Work on something good.  Programmers are the same writers: we spend days knocking on the keyboard.  If we do not have a good story that we want to share, neither the correct syntax nor the attractive cover will save the matter. <br><br>  Have something good to build.  Coders are writers: we spend our days typing on keyboards.  If you don‚Äôt have a good story, it‚Äôs not a cover image. <br><br><br>  <b>Not tired of programming?</b>  <b>What do you do when you feel something like that?</b> <br><br>  When I feel that I am tired of working on features ... I just stop.  Nothing good will come of it when you are tired or bored.  I take a break and either work on something else (with my Open Source project, contours in Rails), or switch to something completely different (I play the piano, learn Japanese).  After some time (sometimes in an hour, sometimes in a couple of days), the inspiration will return, and I will get back to work with enthusiasm. <br><br>  When I feel tired about working on a feature ... I simply stop.  Nothing good will come from working when you are tired or bored.  I like to take a break.  After a while, I‚Äôm excited to come back again. <br><br><br>  <b>Who wanted to be in childhood?</b> <br><br>  I wanted to be a wizard.  Or rather a magician.  Then, when I was 5 years old, I started writing code in BASIC and ... slowly turned into a ‚Äúprogramming‚Äù magician. <br><br>  I wanted to be a wizard.  I mean, a "magician" wizard.  Then at 5, I started coding in Basic and‚Ä¶ slowly became a ‚Äúprogramming‚Äù wizard. <br><br><br>  <b>What report are you going to listen to at RailsClub (we have simultaneous translation)?</b> <br><br>  Of course, everyone!  By the way, my grandfather was Russian, and he taught me to read the Cyrillic alphabet. <br><br>  All of them, of course!  It was funny to read the cyrillic alphabet. <br><br><br>  <b>What do you generally expect from the conference and what would you like to see in Moscow?</b> <br><br>  I really want to see Russian culture at its best, great people, places.  What does not get into the daily news.  Traveling is the best way to get an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa place, and the more you travel, the better you become as a person. <br><br>  I‚Äôm excited about what I‚Äôm looking for.  Traveling is the best way to travel. <br><br><br>  <b>Thanks for the interview and see you in Moscow!</b> <br><br>  At the conference, Claudio will make a report on what cool features and dramatic changes await us in Rails 5. <br><br>  Each big release of Rails brings new cool features and a bunch of headaches to developers who need to upgrade their applications and gems.  The Rails API, ActionCable, Turbolinks 3 are just a few of the changes announced in Rails 5. How can programmers prepare for the future without breaking their existing code?  In his speech, he will talk about the improvements that are waiting for us in Rails 5, explain the motives of the rail team and show how to smoothly translate applications and gems from Rails 4.2 to Rails 5.0. <br><br>  It is worth listening, so it's time to register, if you have not yet. <br>  Registration and payment of participation - <b><a href="https://railsclub.timepad.ru/event/205851/">here</a></b> .
