  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Cocktail for healthy eating - it is made by a startup from the accelerator of ITMO University</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  More and more manufacturers appear on the functional nutrition market.  The Foyt project, based <a href="https://ft.ifmo.ru/">in the accelerator of ITMO Future Technologies University</a> , will try to become a full player in this niche. <br><br> <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/spbifmo/blog/447036/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/co/pp/kr/coppkrfhd8gktvn4napzg4eajee.jpeg"></a> <a name="habracut"></a><br>  <sup><font color="#A9A9A9"><i>Photo ¬© <a href="https://foyt.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dpr%26utm_medium%3Dhabr%26utm_campaign%3Dlink">Foyt</a></i></font></sup> <br><br>  We can say that the growth of interest in this area is still from the beginning of zero.  Then even a special <a href="http://docs.cntd.ru/document/1200039951">GOST R 52349-2005</a> appeared in Russia, which defined functional products.  Just a few years after its introduction, the ‚Äú <a href="http://kremlin.ru/events/president/news/6752">Food Security Doctrine</a> ‚Äù was signed.  It prescribes to increase the production of "functional food" - products that can become an alternative to a full meal or dinner - harmless to health.

      <a href="https://foyt.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dpr%26utm_medium%3Dhabr%26utm_campaign%3Dlink">Foyt</a> is an example of this type of product.  This is a vitamin drink with fatty acids (omega-3 and omega-6) and fiber.  It quenches the feeling of hunger for several hours and replenishes strength during both physical and mental stress. <br><br><h2>  How to make a cocktail </h2><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúDevelopers‚Äù make Foyt from natural ingredients: there are no stabilizers, preservatives and even sugar in it.  The basis of the drink is whey protein and chia seeds, which contain beneficial trace elements and vitamins. </blockquote><br>  Before being released into the series, various combinations of ingredients were tested in the laboratory.  Most of them are purchased by the Foyt team from foreign manufacturers.  The ingredients have their own specification, which contains information on the amount of macro- and micronutrients.  The production process is fully automated, with the exception of packaging.  The packaging design has not yet been finalized, and the company regularly refines it and experiments.  For example, in February, a new series of Foyt came out in portion bags. <br><br><h2>  What are analogs </h2><br>  Such large companies as Soylent (USA), Ambronite (Finland), Huel (Great Britain) work on the market of functional nutrition.  However, they are not officially represented in Russia.  There are other companies - Prana Food, Energy Diet and Herbalife - but they all differ from Foyt in composition.  In the Foyt cocktail, the balance of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%25B8%25D1%2589%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D1%258D%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D1%2586%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%258C">BJU</a> (proteins, fats, carbohydrates) is achieved through a combination of vegetable and animal proteins.  As a result, the consumer gets a daily rate of omega-3 and omega-6.  Without vegetable sources of raw materials to make it difficult. <br><br>  What Foyt still loses to competitors, so it is in the range.  Now you can only buy vanilla cream cocktail.  However, this taste is quite neutral, so customers can experiment: add berries, fruits and even coffee to the drink.  The company is already developing a whole range of tastes.  In the future, there will be banana and chocolate drinks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zw/br/pd/zwbrpd2bomexzkqdp7sdzedrmoy.jpeg"><br>  <sup><font color="#A9A9A9"><i>Photo ¬© <a href="https://foyt.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dpr%26utm_medium%3Dhabr%26utm_campaign%3Dlink">Foyt</a></i></font></sup> <br><br><h2>  Potential in Russia </h2><br>  The Russian market of functional nutrition is estimated at 60 billion rubles.  Experts predict that this figure will increase.  However, the growth rate depends on several players: large-scale food industries and consumers themselves. <br><br>  They should help solve two important problems.  The first is a cost reduction for small industries.  If large companies enter the market and start mass production, the cost of the ingredients will decrease due to increased demand and bulk purchases.  This will help other market participants. <br><br>  The second task is the need to ‚Äúeducate‚Äù the audience and tell potential consumers about the possibilities of functional nutrition.  Many people do not know about such products or do not see suitable opportunities for their use. <br><blockquote>  <i>‚ÄúIf we compare us with the European countries, we will lose 10-15 years to them.</i>  <i>In the West, the range of functional products is so extensive that specialized shops are being opened there, says Artyom Lepeshkin, the founder of the Foyt project.</i>  <i>‚ÄúThe situation is gradually changing, but there is still a lot of work to be done.‚Äù</i> </blockquote><hr><br>  Materials for additional reading in our blog: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/spbifmo/blog/445028/">The smart stethoscope is a startup project from the accelerator of ITMO University</a> .
