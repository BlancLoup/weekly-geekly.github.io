    <h3>  About the idea </h3><br>  <i>The programmer must solve problems not only public, but also his own.</i> <br><br>  At work, we constantly use a great program for taking screenshots of gyazo. <br>  Our version of gyazo uploads screenshots to the company's internal server and then I can‚Äôt manage them anymore. <br>  I also wanted to <i><b>be able to control the lifetime of the screenshots and at the same time just as easy to fumble them by url as gyazo can</b></i> , but since  I actively use dropbox with him and it was decided to be friends. <br><br><h3>  Error number 1: Inattention </h3><br>  <i>The screenshot will upload the screens directly to the dropbox server.</i> <br><br>  Conveniently, because  I can install it on a computer on which the dropbox client is not installed, while all the screens will fall into the desired folder in the dropbox. <br>  I downloaded <a href="https://github.com/dkarzon/DropNet">DropNet</a> and the first version of the screenshot screenshot was ready in a day.  An exact copy of Gyazo, but integrated into Dropbox. <br>  Everything would be fine if it were not for this dropbox restriction. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0dd/d93/d5f/0ddd93d5f62a177870d9828513ef74f5.png" alt="image"><br>  <i><b>The program worked fine with AppKey for developers, but it did not go up = =</b></i> <br><br><h3>  Mistake number 2: complication </h3><br>  <i>I realized that the problem with the dropbox must be solved from the other end.</i> <br><br>  Then I removed the authorization form and made a field in the settings to enter the userId user. <br>  The user had to copy the public link and paste it into this field. <br>  I ripped out the userId link and could form a public link. <br>  <i><b>The solution is clumsy, complex and repulsive to users of its curvature.</b></i> <br><br><h3>  Mistake number 3: Dependence on stereotypes </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/55c/a43/d12/55ca43d12cbf45bfc7c04a71f0076e78.png" alt="image"><br>  <i>I want to take a screenshot of a region, window, or full screen.</i> <br><br>  Having studied various screenshots, I decided to do as everywhere, three hotkeys and a window-helper with buttons for each type of screenshot. <br><br>  <i><b>The decision is stupid.</b></i>  <i><b>You need to think once again what type of screenshot you need and choose one of the options.</b></i> <br><br><h3>  Another mistake </h3><br>  <i>I want to be able to take screenshots of the menu and tooltips.</i> <br><br>  Most of the screenshots work on this principle: <br><ol><li>  We press hotkey </li><li>  choose what to photograph </li><li>  take pictures </li></ol><br>  The problem is that at the stage number 2 we have the opportunity to skins the menu and tooltip, because  they will be lost due to loss of focus = ( <br><br>  <i>I decided to enter a delay in seconds, until the screen capture takes place</i> .  Those.  the user must click something like the ‚ÄúDelayed Screenshot‚Äù button and in a short time bring the workspace to the desired state. <br>  <i><b>The decision is wrong.</b></i>  <i><b>What if the user does not have time?</b></i>  <i><b>What if it does everything very quickly and you have to wait until the program takes a screenshot?</b></i>  <i><b>Yes, this is just a few seconds, but it will be annoying if you need to take a few tultips in a row.</b></i> <i><br></i> <br><h3>  Error N: Impatience </h3><br>  <i>I want the public screenshot to open automatically in the browser</i> <br><br>  The error was that after saving, I immediately opened the url in the browser and the user saw Error 404, because  dropbox client has not had time to upload the file to the server. <br><br><h3>  I'm already tired of writing about errors </h3><br>  <i>I want to talk about the solutions found.</i> <br><br><ul><li>  Integration with Dropbox only on computers with the dropbox client installed.  In fact, I write the file to disk in MyDropbox / Public / and wait when it is uploaded to the server </li><li>  Do not require UserId from the user.  It can be obtained via WinAPI by calling the copy public link in the context menu of the public file. </li><li>  No window helper with three buttons.  One hot key.  You can take a picture of the screen area by stretching a region, or take a picture of a window by clicking on it. </li><li>  A screenshot is made when you press a hot key.  All menus and tooltips present on the screen are being photographed.  Next, you need to select the desired screen area or click in the desired window. </li><li>  After saving the screenshot to the disk, I wait for it to download to the server and only then open it in the browser. </li></ul><br><br>  The program has a few more convenience, such as viewing a list of recently taken screenshots and the ability to change the basic settings. <br><br><h3>  Those who read </h3><br>  The project decided to do open, t.ch.  everyone can see my shoals in the code =) <br>  <a href="http://cloudshot.codeplex.com/">Link to the project page on codeplex</a> <br>  At the moment, it is distributed as a <a href="http://cloudshot.codeplex.com/releases/view/69182">ClickOnce</a> application, but I can also make an installer. <br><br>  <b>PS</b> <br>  Many thanks to my colleagues for interesting ideas and help in testing. <br>  Surely there are mistakes in CloudShot, do not kick for them much, but better write it down and I will correct them as far as possible;) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/127815/">https://habr.com/ru/post/127815/</a></p>
