  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Review of Kopini in pictures</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello.  It‚Äôs time to write about the <a href="http://copiny.com/">Kopini</a> service <a href="http://copiny.com/">itself</a> , otherwise it‚Äôs all about the internal kitchen, the office and the team.  We decided not to interfere with the information about the service itself and why we decided to make it free in one post (so we hid it in drafts and finished it).  On the features of the freemium model in RuNet and why we chose it for Kopini, I will tell you in detail in the next post. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/8a8cb82b/22ade099/0bbd35a6/3780105c.jpg"><br><br>  Prehistory, for whom the service will be useful, a couple of cases, some statistics and the main features under the cut.  If you are too lazy to read, look at the presentation about the <a href="http://copiny.com/why">benefits</a> and <a href="http://copiny.com/help">opportunities of</a> Kopini. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Briefly service history </h4>  In the middle of 2010, working on one project, it became necessary to get as much useful feedback as possible from users and rally them in the community.  It was necessary to understand where to develop the project and somehow to establish contact with his audience.  The forum was dropped immediately - too complex in promotion, a lot of superfluous and lack of the necessary functionality.  Then I found Reformal and it seemed that this was what was needed, but the guys broke me off twice.  The first time I paid for the service was for half a year, and a week later it was made free.  In the second, when I realized that the service practically does not develop.  In Usereho, I didn‚Äôt like the interface and some features.  This is my subjective opinion on the status of projects at that time.  I do not want to offend the guys at all, especially since over the past few months the projects have grown qualitatively.  We respect competitors!

      At that moment, it was found at getsatisfaction.com, but what was our disappointment when it turned out that there is no Russian interface (and it is not expected), nor is there any support for the Russian language in principle.  Then, like most developers, I guess, there was a desire to make a decision.  Do something really useful and more than just a service to collect ideas.  Since November 1, 2010 launched Kopini. <br><br><h4>  Statistics </h4>  It is displayed on the main and updated in real time.  Here are tsiferki at the time of writing the post: <br><ul><li>  <b>635</b> communities </li><li>  <b>100001</b> users (Hooray!), </li><li>  <b>8064</b> discussions. </li></ul><br><h4>  Now about the service itself </h4>  <a href="http://copiny.com/">Kopini</a> is a way of productive communication with your clients / users on the Internet.  The service is a collective knowledge base, a support forum and feedback at the same time.  When we first talk about Kopini to clients, they make round eyes and ask to set an example, since they have not seen anything like this before.  As they say, it‚Äôs better to see once than hear a hundred times, so more screenshots. <br><br>  <b>Community Home</b> <br>  On the main page there is all the basic information about the community: a search / add discussion form, popular ideas, current issues, common errors, statistics, TOP members and categories.  This page starts working with the community. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/24ba4297/78beb721/a8738b4c/e2d28871.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Talk page</b> <br>  This is a specific discussion page.  Here users can leave their comments and vote for the comments of others (the best comment will be selected).  It is also possible to vote and subscribe to the discussion, then all comments and official responses will be sent to the post office.  Representatives of the company can change the status of the discussion (for example, the question ‚Äúwith the answer‚Äù or the idea ‚Äúin work‚Äù) and leave a formal answer.  Useful feature with the collection of add.  information (browser version, OS, screen resolution, etc.), it makes life easier for developers. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/a7e1b699/74f7214c/e15e62ed/470b9073.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Discussion list and user page</b> <br>  On the left we have a list of discussions that can be sorted in various ways.  Right page with community members. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/c964c1d6/43d8fc29/a170f1b2/38742d73.jpg"><br><br>  In order not to zaspamlivat box information about events in the community, made <b>digests</b> , the frequency of which is configured in the profile.  It‚Äôs difficult to list all the possibilities; it‚Äôs better to see live here at <a href="http://community.copiny.com/">community.copiny.com</a> (our community).  Screen pop-up widget first in the topic. <br><br>  <b>Integration with soc.</b>  <b>by networks</b> <br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/2e5e57dc/beff414d/d930a55a/7b012ef6.jpg" alt="image">  Recently, we have made it possible to place widgets on Twitter, Vkontakte and Facebook on the main page of the community.  And also added buttons posting discussions in these social.  network.  Now each community member can share his question or idea in one click. <br><br>  In general, we will continue to take steps towards tight integration with social networks.  If you have any specific wishes - we will be only happy. <br><br>  <b>Killer feature - "Overview"</b> <br>  This thing does not just allow you to sort and filter discussions in all possible ways.  For example, select all discussions of the type ‚Äúidea‚Äù with the word ‚Äúplayer‚Äù in the title from the category ‚ÄúVkontakte‚Äù with the status ‚Äúin work‚Äù, published in the period from 01/01/2011 to 01/02/2011 and ordered by the date of the last activity.  But also will prompt, what discussions should be paid <b>special attention</b> in order not to lose sight of anything. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/b9e89092/7179a64c/7ee1ca73/e04a322b.jpg"><br><br><h4>  For whom Kopini will be useful </h4><ul><li>  <b>For site owners, portals and blogs</b> - to get feedback from their audience and have the opportunity to build a community; </li><li>  <b>For software developers</b> - to improve service and reduce support costs, collect suggestions and manage product development, quickly identify bugs and quickly solve user problems; </li><li>  <b>For online services and startups</b> - to hear your audience and understand what it needs, to provide support and quickly respond to problems; </li><li>  <b>For service companies (Internet providers, banks, brokers, etc.)</b> - to build a loyal customer community, locate them to the brand, get feedback and be aware of the problems. </li></ul><br>  Some kind of direct universal service turned out =).  Here are a couple of cases: <a href="http://copiny.com/static/casestudy/CaseStudyHomemoney.pdf">Homemoney online accounting</a> and <a href="http://copiny.com/static/casestudy/CaseStudyBitCreative.pdf">social software developer.</a>  <a href="http://copiny.com/static/casestudy/CaseStudyBitCreative.pdf">games bit creative</a> . <br><br><h4>  Differences from competitors </h4>  Copini is often compared to Reformal and Yuzereho, but these services are completely different.  Kopini is not a service for collecting ideas, but a tool for building productive communication with your customers, where collecting ideas is just a small part of the feedback.  Of course, recently the developers of similar projects have made many steps in this direction, they are great.  But the end result can be assessed only by customers.  By the way, here is an article on IBusiness <a href="http://www.ibusiness.ru/5810">www.ibusiness.ru/5810</a> , where services were compared. <br><br><h4>  Free rate </h4>  Now he appeared in Copini.  <a href="http://copiny.com/price">They</a> tried to make the <a href="http://copiny.com/price">tariff</a> so that it could cover all the basic needs for communication, support and marketing.  A set of features will gradually complement.  I recommend immediately choosing the ‚ÄúBusiness‚Äù tariff to familiarize yourself with all the current features of the service (30 days free, after which the transition to the base tariff is automatic). <br><br>  That's all.  We will be glad to see Kopini on your websites and blogs. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/113764/">https://habr.com/ru/post/113764/</a></p>
