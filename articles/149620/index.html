  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Business is like football</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I love to watch football and play it.  I follow the news of different clubs.  And I often wonder that football is a projection of our business in all successes and failures, breakthroughs and failures, laws and contingencies. <br><br>  Relatively speaking, the team of our company is a football team.  The criterion of victories or defeats is the profitability of the business.  If you can score goals and not miss, you grow.  You know how to not miss at least - already a sign of stability.  You skip and don't score - it's time to change the coach at least, and maybe go down to the lower league, rethink the key issues and then prove that you can fight along with strong competitors. <br><br>  The basis of the team is midfielders.  In our case, these are the developers.  Here also directors and testers.  That is, those who create the product or service.  Technical support is protection.  If the defense is attentive and experienced, then it copes with clients with high quality and well, retains their loyalty and leaves no doubt about the future profitability of the business.  Forwards is a sales department.  It is clear that a good salesman should be aggressive, persistent, restless, but at the same time correct (technical) jewelry maker of his craft.  Agree, this is exactly what the attacker should be.  Otherwise, he can inflict a lot of punches, but they will not hit the shots.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The role of a manager in different companies is different.  Ideally, this is a coach.  Desirable good, experienced, "experienced".  He played at one time in different parts of the field.  He knows what and how to demand from the players in different situations.  It builds understanding in the team, if necessary, rotates it, motivates, scolds, comforts, etc. <br><br>  The leader must be a tactician and strategist.  At meetings, he gives the team installation, sets tasks.  Well, everything is like in football.  And the outcome of the match depends on the correct installation of the game.  If his business idea is correct, then there will be a result.  How many times do we hear the phrase that one coach outplayed another.  Competition in business lives exactly according to the same laws.  And there are not so many accidents. <br><br>  If a business fails, then the manager, as responsible for the final result, has to play the role of a goalkeeper.  The midfield missed an opponent, the defense does not cope, and now the goalkeeper has to catch shots on goal in the form of customer complaints, partners' claims.  And the more unbalanced the team, the more strikes will be inflicted by the opponent. <br>  And it is even difficult in this situation to say whether it is a good leader or, on the contrary, a bad one.  On the one hand, instead of embarking on the coaching bridge and establishing ‚Äúconnections‚Äù in the team, he is not doing his job.  On the other hand, he stands at the final line and saves the whole team.  Being spectators or fans, we look at this situation and think about whether it is worth saving such a team.  Maybe she needs to lose hard and seriously and rethink everything ... <br><br>  Interesting is the role of the captain.  By position, he is the right hand of the coach, but he also has to be ‚Äúhis‚Äù in the team.  A strong captain can shake the team at the right time, charge with emotions.  By the way, is it necessary to be such a person?  A weak captain is a coach's mistake, it would be better if there was no captain at all.  In such a team will be anger, misunderstanding and understatement.  Here I look at Arshavin and I think that the player is technical, good, and as a leader, it probably hinders.  Let's hope today's friendly match will answer this question. <br><br>  The important point is not only the game of the team on the field.  But the microclimate outside the field.  I remember very well when Guus Hidding became a coach, he always repeated that it was necessary to work with the team not only on the field.  Once at a gathering in front of a responsible game, answering the question of how a team is being prepared, he answered something like ‚Äúlet's drink wine and discuss key issues‚Äù.  Psychology solves a lot.  Hidding did a lot of things then.  Also in business.  The results of the work will necessarily affect how and when the team communicates outside the work.  Here, probably, only one rule can be formulated: there should not be dull standards, stamps and extremes.  How exactly to achieve this should feel the coach.  Each team has its own microclimate, and it can change. <br><br>  The analogies of the business results and the results of the game on the field can be continued indefinitely.  The role of club owners (count shareholders), sports director is important.  It is interesting to watch the development of scandals in the club and the consequences to which they lead.  A separate topic is the transfer policy.  Bought a cool player, but he does not play.  Why?  And in fact, for what reason are highly paid employees hired and there is no profitability?  I'm not talking about the situation when in general the team ‚Äúhands over‚Äù the match, and the game is not going according to sporting rules. <br><br>  In general, the conclusion is, if you love football and understand the basic laws in it, then you are able to start a business.  Dial a team.  And even the yard team can achieve significant success if everything is balanced with it. <br>  Or maybe you already have a successful team, then knowing football stories will help anticipate star diseases, control the recession, and may even part with the best player at the peak of its value. <br><br>  Actually, what was all this I told ... <br>  Any self-respecting club has or plans to have its own stadium and training base.  If the club has this basis, then the team has every chance to fight for the highest prizes. <br>  So BuchSoft has its own ‚Äústadium‚Äù this year - a new office at the metro station Novoslobodskaya.  It will allow us to accommodate more freely, accommodate more incoming customers (fans). <br>  I do not upload photos, because, looking at the offices of Yandex and Google, there is nothing to surprise.  But for work and leisure have everything you need, including the kitchen, aquarium, fireplace and a board for offline chat and anonymous letters! <br><br>  I hope this will have a beneficial effect on the game of our BuchSoft team in the future! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/149620/">https://habr.com/ru/post/149620/</a></p>
