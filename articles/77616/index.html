  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Half a year with CrowdA (summing up)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In August I already <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/startup/66169/">published a</a> detailed description of the <a href="http://www.crowda.com/">CrowdA</a> service <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/startup/66169/">on Habr√©</a> and how to work with it.  Now I want to present to you the results of the work of the visited site with this system for six months, for clarity, statistical data will be presented. <br>  How did it all start?  As a site administrator, I have long thought about the idea that we should somehow encourage users who fill the site with content.  But how?  Let users embed their ad code in their news?  This option was rejected immediately, because it has a lot of "pitfalls", you need to control so that you do not insert any rubbish containing malicious code, advertising resources that contradict the rules of the site, aka adult and hedgehog.  In principle, all these problems can be solved, but then additional human resources will be required, in this situation ‚Äúthe game is not worth the candle‚Äù.  The second option was considered to be this - to give the news authors a certain percentage of advertising earnings.  Depending on the popularity of the add, the implementation and calculation of how much it should be, in principle, is simple and implementable at no additional cost.  But at the final stage, the question of payments, dozens, hundreds of small payments in different payment systems arises - this is the stage at which the problem arises with human resources and the responsibility of the resource for payments to the authors.  I, too, was not ready to take it upon myself.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãencouraging the authors was postponed to a distant box until the spring of 2009 the CrowdA service appeared on the network, after a brief conversation with the support (they understand Russian), it was decided to start cooperation with them. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  Among several schemes of work, the following was chosen: the news authors are allocated an advertising space inside the news, i.e.  when a visitor came under scut news, on the main and in sections of the site the income from advertising places goes only to the benefit of the website, and inside the news some of the advertising places bring income to the author of the news (I hope it is available explained). <br>  From a technical point of view, starting a website with the CrowdA service is not difficult, our programmer installed the system in 30 minutes, then an announcement was placed on the website in which the news authors were asked to register in the CrowdA system and start receiving some reward for their news.  I want to emphasize that no one is obliged to register authors, if you want to receive a reward - register, do not want - post news as before.  A lot of people registered, and the site began to work with a new scheme to encourage authors.  Below are statistics on the number of news items on the site, statistics on the growth of the site itself (traffic, search traffic quantity, etc.). <br>  After the announcement that they were paying for the news, many authors decided to take in quantity, but after a month of work they understood the simple truth that a dozen high-quality and interesting news bring more profit than a hundred regular news that does not stand out from the crowd.  The graph below shows this clearly.  Let me remind you that in February there was no payment for news, the increase in the number of news in March is connected with the reward system. <br><br><img src="http://pixhost.ws/avaxhome/e2/11/001111e2.png" alt="image"><br><br>  A large amount of news on the site has led to an increase in the number of pages indexed in search engines (today there are more than a million pages in Google Index), which in turn has led to an increase in resource traffic.  The following chart shows the growth dynamics of search traffic and the number of unique visitors per month.

    <img src="http://pixhost.ws/avaxhome/df/11/001111df.png" alt="image"><br><br>  I want to immediately say that the site does not conduct any work in the field of SEO. <br><br>  For all the time the site worked with the CrowdA service, the news authors were paid <b>$ 3,343</b> from March to December 2009. <br><br>  Another advantage of the CrowdA system is the presence of one account with the authors.  At the moment, several sites and forums of the same niche work in their system; the author, by posting his news on several sites, receives a reward on one account of the CrowdA service. <br>  The flexibility of the system allows you to customize the reward scheme very loyally, for example, you can give reward only in one section of the site (forum), or pay rewards not to authors, but to moderators who work on the site, etc. <br><br>  In general, this is all I wanted to tell the habrovans about my work experience, to be honest, I am satisfied with the results, the remuneration system allows the resource to constantly grow, which is what I need as a resource administrator.  If anyone has any questions, I will be happy to answer in the comments to the article. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/77616/">https://habr.com/ru/post/77616/</a></p>
