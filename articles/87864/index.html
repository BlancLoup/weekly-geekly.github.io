As a rule, at this stage, you can face three problems. <br><br>  The first is that tape drives in your mind are vaguely associated with the Dr.Alban group or any other sign of the distant 90s.  Now, in an age of almost total downtroddenness of the data warehouse market with various reusable recording devices, we often discard old proven technologies.  At the same time, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãreuse is forgotten that no other type of media can match the cost of storing a gigabyte of data with tape drives. <br><br>  The second problem is when you have really lost the habit (or never got used) to work with something other than hard drives or flash drives.  Here we will come to the aid of an external version of the drive, connected via USB: it will just be another nice box on your desk.  If the procedure of disassembling / assembling a computer is not difficult for you, then you can save a little by buying an internal mount device that is connected via the SAS interface.

      And here we are covered by the third wave - how to organize work with the device, because you have never come across it before?  We come to the aid of complete software - HP Data Protector Express Single Server Edition.  Most likely, this software will be able to satisfy 90% of novice user requests, which is what we need. <br><br>  Now, what brings us the seventh generation? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Small yes removed! </h4><br>  It would seem that you can improve in the drive, the first ancestor of which appeared in the early 80s of the last century?  After all, everything has long been invented! <br><br>  But technology and technical thought do not stand still, and here is the result: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Expected increase in capacity.  According to the good old tradition - double, so now on the ribbon, which resembles a matchbox in the shape and size, it can fit up to 320 GB (2: 1 compression). <br>  ‚Ä¢ Increased write / read speed.  In this box, data flies at speeds up to 86 GB / hour, i.e.  the tape is recorded in less than 4 hours. <br>  ‚Ä¢ halved power consumption of the device.  This once again proves that the pursuit of the ideal is bearing fruit, very pleasant for the user. <br><br><h4>  What is customary to be silent </h4><br><img src="http://hpdc.ru/images/HP_dds_dat.jpg" alt="HP DDS / DAT Cartridges" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="5">  Ask yourself the question: when did you start thinking about buying and using a tape drive not as a waste of money and time, but as a great help in case of a problem with the server?  A frequent answer to this question: never.  Even after you had experienced several unpleasant incidents when the server went down, the work of the office became, and your table was besieged by crowds of colleagues with pitchforks and torches. <br><br>  And here in vain!  After all, the owners of all HP tape drives have the opportunity to secure their server economy with the help of the <a href="http://h18000.www1.hp.com/products/storageworks/drs/index.html">One Button Disaster Recovery</a> (OBDR) feature.  Thanks to her, your Proliant, which has suffered from damage to the OS, applications or data, can boot from the last backup cartridge, as from a DVD-ROM and fully restore its state before the accident.  All this - by pressing a single button.  The time of downtime in this case is reduced to a few minutes, so your employees will only have to drink tea again. <br><br>  As a result, the current generation of tape drives from HP, along with the most developed technical basis among all types of data storage devices, has all the attributes that will allow them to fit into the most modern infrastructure of your network. <br><br>  And now, as always, we are waiting for your questions) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/87864/">https://habr.com/ru/post/87864/</a></p>
