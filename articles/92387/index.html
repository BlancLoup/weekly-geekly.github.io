  <section class="page js-page"><h1>ASUS Design</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  For ASUS engineers, the word ‚Äúdesign‚Äù is not an empty sound - anyone can see this by looking at the range of products that the company has launched on the market for many years.  They began to copy someone's style?  Nah, not their profile.  Do they have a Stakhanovist designer?  Oh well ... one just can not cope!  So what's the deal?  Whose, I ask, easel?  ) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6ce/d35/1f3/6ced351f3e5c987d8eb7ce4f96cc0414.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It is logical to assume that in such a large company as ASUS, the designer is really not alone.  In order to make it really beautiful, a large company has its own design department, which I would like to say a few words. <br><br>  To begin with, I propose to open the following address on the new tab - <a href="http://www.asusdesign.com/">www.asusdesign.com</a> - now you can continue reading under the pleasant chill out track (it‚Äôs very cool to work with!).  And there the beauty always have time to look.

      I was at the offices of many companies - usually they meet in a meeting room, all the walls of which are decorated with all sorts of certificates, thanks and awards.  But far from every such room you can meet serious international awards for product design.  ASUS is, figuratively speaking, a veteran, whose entire chest is hung with an incredible number of awards, including design.  Speaking of the latter, I hint at the RedDot Design Award, the Good Design Award - the most prestigious medals, which are awarded only the best of the best.  ASUS has repeatedly won such awards for various products - from laptops and monitors, to keyboards and wireless routers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4c0/cdc/2e2/4c0cdc2e22f2da882ef047e196781d6d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And to the question ‚ÄúWho does all this?‚Äù, The answer is simple: <b>ASUS DESIGN</b> is a multidisciplinary team that brings together the experience and talent of people from all over the world.  Apparently, thanks to this, the team has a good balance of creative inspiration and technical skill. <br>  The goal of this team is to create products that meet the requirements of users in everyday life, so that customers can truly enjoy their high-quality solutions.  After all, the variety of technology that surrounds us has become an integral part of our being with you. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ae8/be0/4fd/ae8be04fdfbc0016d0628a19f0879f02.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/495/5cc/c1f/4955ccc1f9cf33936e86494a91663d11.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Any product passing through ASUS DESIGN first goes through the research department, in which the processes of forecasting and thorough analysis of technologies, market, user needs, various trends are activated.  After that, the work begins to boil in the innovative and material laboratories.  Then, industrial design specialists working together with the department of visual communications go into battle.  Completing a long chain packaging design team.  Apparently, the work of all these divisions under the motto ‚ÄúWork smart‚Äù is the main condition for achieving the best results. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/558/c16/e94/558c16e947296dbbbe6c723f222ee61f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The best place where it is not a shame to show your own innovations and recent achievements to the general public are events like the Computex or CeBIT exhibitions. <br>  For example, at the international conference held at the exhibition Computex 2009, the head of ASUSTeK Computer Inc.  Johnny Shih (Jonney Shih) shared information about the new concept of monolithic design, which will be used in the development of its subsequent models.  The company intends to focus on high quality and innovation, citing the example of the ASUS UX30 laptop, the EeePC Seashell series and the ultra-thin MS display series.  Speaking of the latter: according to representatives of ASUS, the design of these monitors was inspired by the concept of a binary code, in particular, the contrast between symbols 1 and 0. You can only assume that the profile of the LCD monitor should symbolize 1, while the rounded support embodies 0 . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/08e/ac0/a3c/08eac0a3c52125c379b03a9cc8a7afc0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  At CeBIT 2009, ASUS also decided not to deny itself the pleasure of beating people.  For example, the leader in the notebook market presented to the public the latest innovation - a laptop with two touch screens.  There is no keyboard as such, but one of the screens easily turns into it.  It is not yet known how such an approach would be convenient for the average user in the final result, but something else is important. <br>  This concept is part of the ‚ÄúCommunity Designed PC‚Äù project (Computer Created Together), initiated by ASUS and Intel.  The bottom line is that anyone can take part in creating a new product - the company promises to consider every opinion and suggestion.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãproduct development together with users is still under development, but anyone can take part in the project by visiting the site WePC.com.  However, the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/asus/blog/88169/">results of a</a> local WePC competition were recently <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/asus/blog/88169/">summed up</a> , in which many readers took part. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/44a/8a0/cd1/44a8a0cd1faa2a3d178d820aa9c7d57f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The latest CeBIT also did not go without surprises - for example, such elegant devices as the multimedia notebook <b>ASUS NX90</b> , gaming <b>G73</b> with the taste of the stealth aircraft, <b>ASUS EeeKeyboard</b> - ‚ÄúAtom‚Äù keyboard with a large color screen were presented to the public.  All this will soon make reviews;) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/310/b70/ce1/310b70ce14de36bf032bc6638cfae741.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  ASUS is striving to become a globally recognized brand and, apparently, the design department, designed to help in this endeavor, does its job well. <br><br>  Do not forget to connect to the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/asus/blog/">company's blog</a> on the site! <br><br>  <b>Successes!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/92387/">https://habr.com/ru/post/92387/</a></p>
