The blogosphere - an earlier oasis for casual expression and clever thoughts - has swept through a tsunami of paid-up nonsense.  Cheap journalism and guerrilla marketing campaigns stifled the sincere voices of non-professional masters of the word.  It has become almost impossible to attract attention to yourself, except perhaps the attention of critics.  And why bother?  The time that is spent writing fine wit prose will be more useful to spend, expressing yourself on Flickr, Facebook or Twitter. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  If you stop blogging now, you‚Äôll be in a good company.  A well-known poker fan, Jason Calacanis made millions on his Weblogs network.  But he completely abandoned his blog in June.  ‚ÄúBlogging is just too big, too impersonal, and it lacks the intimacy that attracted me to it,‚Äù he wrote in his last post.

      He is right about impersonality: check the list of the top 100 blogs on Technorati and you will find that personal sites have been superseded by professional ones.  Many of these are essentially online magazines: The Huffington Post.  Engadget.  TreeHugger.  An independent commentator will not hijack a team of professional authors, issuing up to 30 posts per day. <br><br>  When the blogosphere was still young, enthusiasts were on horseback, and their posts quickly found themselves in the top of Google‚Äôs issue on any request, fueled by cross-references from familiar bloggers.  In 2002, the search for the word "Mark" gave the web developer Mark Pilgrim (Mark Pilgrim) above Mark Twain himself.  This phenomenon was part of what made blogging so attractive.  But those times are over.  Today, if you are looking for, say, the last speech of Barack Obama, the first links will lead to a page in Wikipedia, an article on Fox News and a couple of entries from professional sites such as Politico.com.  What are the chances that your smart record will take a high position in this list?  Almost zero. <br><br>  Thus, your blog will attract only the lowest form of network life: debaters and brawlers.  Pour out your soul in a blog, and any anonymous troll with the nickname r0rschach or foohack will quickly scribble under your post: ‚ÄúNonsense.  Why don't you just kiss McCain's ass? ‚ÄùThat's why Calacanis hid in his personal mailing list.  He can speak with his fans directly, without suffering from the idiotic replicas of anonymous spitters. <br><br>  Moreover, websites with textual content are no longer so popular.  The reason blogs have soared is that they made publishing text easy for non-techies.  Part of this simplicity was the lack of support for pictures, sound and video.  At that time, multimedia content was too heavy to download and demanding on the speed of the channel. <br><br>  Social multimedia sites like Yutyube, Flikra and Facebook have made publishing pictures and videos as easy as typing.  Even easier if you take into account the time that most bloggers spend in caring about the quality of their texts.  Take a cue from Robert Scoble, who made a name for himself in the blogosphere as the ‚Äútechnical evangelist‚Äù of Microsoft in 2003-2006.  Today he focused on posting videos and notes on Twitter.  ‚ÄúI left mostly long texts for the blog,‚Äù he says. <br><br>  Twitter, limiting the record length to 140 characters, in 2008 is what the blogosphere was in 2004.  You will find here Scoble, Calacanis and most of their buddies of that golden era.  They argue: this is because Twitter is much more operational than the blogosphere.  And you can search Twitter entries through your own search, without waiting for Google to index them. <br><br>  Despite the fact that I am a writer, I am completely on the side of the main advantage of Twitter: brevity.  Bloggers today are required to write clever and insightful prose to compete with Huffington and The New York Times.  Limiting Twitter to record size makes everyone equal.  This allows amateur bloggers to stop worrying about the quality of their texts and get to the bottom line.  @WiredReader: Kill the blog.  2004 is over.  Google won't find you - just junk from HuffPo, NYT.  In comments are assholes.  See you on Facebook. <br><br>  <i><a href="http://socvestnik.ru/2008/12/11/tvitter-flickr-facebook-wired/">Source of</a></i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/48136/">https://habr.com/ru/post/48136/</a></p>
