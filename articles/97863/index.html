And over there ... but no, there is a sign.  Pancake‚Ä¶.  Wherever, wherever ... well, over there ... "And leaving his car, as usual, for 5 minutes, he wonders whether it is being evacuated or not during this time. <br>  And then they spend half a day or night on trips with their cars, first to the traffic police, then to the car park.  The queues to defend, to get here and there - all this takes, with rare exception, on average from 4 to 8 hours.  And time is money, especially working time. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Few numbers</b>

      In the center of Moscow, about 2 million cars are parked every day.  That is, physically no place to park.  The parking situation is well known to all. <br>  500-600 cars are evacuated in Moscow per day.  And this is 15000-18000 per month. <br><br>  At the same time, the Moscow authorities began to increase the pace of evacuation - they open new car parks, introduce amendments to the laws that allow evacuating cars from sidewalks and ‚Äúinterfering with pedestrians‚Äù, plan to increase the existing evacuation fleet from 100 to 300. Everyone has probably read about it in the news. <br><br>  You can count, of course, the chances of evacuation of each motorist, but nobody needs it, so it is clear that almost everyone has a chance, and they will only grow. <br><br>  <b>How to avoid evacuation?</b> <br><br>  The surest way is to try to park where it is allowed or in paid parking lots.  But not everyone has this opportunity.  Another way is to go by public transport, but again, not everyone can or will.  And other methods will not save you from evacuation.  It remains to hope for good luck. <br><br>  Not the evacuation itself is terrible, but its consequences are the need to spend half a day / night on the return of the car.  Therefore, we decided to help all motorists to avoid these consequences. <br><br>  <b>What have we done?</b> <br><br>  We launched the project " <a href="http://carback.ru/">CarBack - return service for evacuated cars</a> ." <br>  We decided to save the motorist from the need to spend their working or personal time to return the car - it is better to spend this time on something useful or pleasant. <br><br>  <b>How exactly?</b> <br><br>  We provide motorists with 2 types of services: <br>  1) For those who have already been evacuated - return the car; <br>  2) For those who want to solve this problem in advance - evacuation insurance. <br><br>  <u>Car return</u> - a person calls or sends a request through the site, and we send the manager to his office / home / anywhere.  A contract and all necessary documents are drawn up (a description of the damage to the car before the evacuation, the presence of things in it, a power of attorney, etc.).  The client sends the technical passport and the keys to the car and then the manager goes to register everything in the traffic police and to the car park and delivers a car to the tow truck where the client needs. <br>  As a result, the client gets up from the chair and not looking up from his affairs, gets the car back. <br><br>  If the client is afraid to give away the keys, then it is possible without delivery of the car - the client will simply arrive at the car park, receive all documents from the manager, sit in his car and drive. <br><br>  <u>Evacuation insurance</u> - through the site you can subscribe to the return service, in case you evacuate the car.  The subscription is valid for one calendar year.  And if suddenly, the car is evacuated during this period, you just need to call us - we will send the manager to the client, who, according to the scheme described above, will return the car. <br><br>  What guarantees, how quickly we return the car and other troubling questions, we have described on the <a href="http://carback.ru/">site</a> on the pages with the description of services and in the ‚Äúquestions and answers‚Äù ‚Äã‚Äãsection.  I will not describe here, so as not to make the post very long. <br><br>  <b>But what about the educational effect?</b> <br><br>  And there is no educational effect. <br>  Having gone once the way to return his car, a person will, of course, remember him for some time and curse.  Will even try to park so as not to be evacuated.  But then we all understand that fundamentally it does not change anything - you still need to park and still there is no place. <br><br>  PS I am always glad to constructive criticism and suggestions, and I am ready to answer any questions in the comments, on the page of our group on Facebook or Twitter, do not hesitate to write. <br>  PS2.  I would be happy to post this text on AutoCADAB, but I do not have an account there.  So, I will be glad to invite. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/97863/">https://habr.com/ru/post/97863/</a></p>
