  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Practicing radio as it is - a view from the inside</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  After reading the ‚Äúfreshly published‚Äù <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/wireless/127235/">practice of radio communications</a> , as it is, thoughts arose about the fact that it is worth sharing your experience of amateur radio connected practice. <br><br>  Since 2004, I have been confronted almost every day with connected equipment (if earlier it was a hobby, now it has become bread), both HF and VHF. <br><br>  VHF communication (up to 1 GHz), without distortion (the use of reflection of radio waves from meteor showers, the moon, etc.), looks simple: the communication range directly depends on the transmitter power and the height of the antenna suspension. <br>  HF communication is a more unusual phenomenon, because the radio wave, depending on the condition, can bend around the earth several times, and it can even be "intermodulated" by lightning discharges if there is a thunderstorm between interlocutors.  And maybe, again, depending on the conditions (and, in particular, on the direction of the antenna), to enter the ionosphere at a critical angle and go into an infinitely distant cosmos ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In the comments to the same article there are questions about receiving a radio call sign, I went through this procedure in 2005, in Russia (then I was only 15 years old), so at the moment this scheme may be somewhat different: <br>  1 - apply to the local DOSAAF (radio club, DYuTs, SYT, etc.). <br>  2 - a state fee is paid (in 2005 it was 60 rubles). <br>  3 - a commission is organized at the local (regional, in the case of sparsely populated regions of the country) level and a qualifying exam is taken (in my case it was a drunk of examiners for the means of the examinee, if you are lucky, you will get a normal exam).  In my case, the questions were average, about what they teach in technical schools - not too much theory, not too much tupism.  Questions are made up of the course of analogue technology (RPU, RPRU, AFU circuitry, circuit theory, RCiS). <br>  4 - relevant documents are issued (license, call sign documents).

      Remark: At the moment, my callsign is invalid for non-payment of annual fees. <br><br>  And so, after receiving the call sign, according to the principle - first a cow, then a bucket, we look towards our future equipment.  Here you can enjoy unlimited space for imagination, fantasy and, as a result, technical creativity ... You can assemble all the necessary equipment yourself, although this is a personal matter for everyone, if the budget allows, you can buy YAESU FT-2000.  In my case, it was a transceiver "Wave", domestic production, bought in a local connected circle (because they were closed due to low attendance - there were only two of us) from the director of the CY. <br><br>  ATTENTION!  If you are going to make a transceiver yourself, then you will need to go through the registration procedure for this product.  With the receipt of those.  passport and transmitter license. <br><br>  And so, we got the call sign, acquired a transceiver and antenna (well, or did it yourself, which is rare nowadays) and set it up, now it's time to go on air! <br>  But before going on the air, you should familiarize yourself with one more thing: <br>  Decent radio amateurs have their own on-board magazine in which they write down the details of each communication performed.  This information is standardized and represents data on the time of communication (UTC naturally), the interlocutor's call sign (about the procedure for issuing and dividing call signs in the world, you can read in Google :)), the interlocutor's location (QTH), the quality of the received signal (encoded in two digits from 1 to 5, as well as from 1 to 9), where the first digit indicates the quality of signal modulation, and the second is the relative volume level with which the interlocutor is received.  An excellent rating is 59. Further, at the request of the participants, this link is fixed with a QSL card (more details about which can be read in Google). <br><br>  Log, transceiver, call we have ... it's time to fight !!! <br><br>  Amateur radio communication is a rather serious thing, and its conduct is subject to a certain regulation.  In general, it looks like this: one subscriber gives a general call, and anyone can join it <br>  - RA9WLN - I give a common challenge to all! <br>  - RA9WLN, here is UA4WMX. <br>  - UA4WMX here is RA9WLN, good time of day, my name is XXX, my QTH village.  Rainbow, I accept you on 5/8. <br>  - RA9WLN, here is UA4WMX. And I welcome you, my name is XXX, my QTH Izhevsk, I accept you on 5/9. <br>  - UA4WMX here is RA9WLN, great, I have no questions for you, all of you are good and 73! <br>  - RA9WLN, here is UA4WMX, mutually, 73! <br><br>  [where RA9WLN, UA4WMX - callsign;  5/9 - quality assessment of the received signal;  QTH - location;  73 - international numerical amateur radio code, meaning literally "Successes and all the best"] <br><br>  remark: For radio amateurs, in particular for those who use Morse code, a Q-code is used to reduce the recording of their message. <br>  _______ <br>  This is how radio communication goes, ask what the joke of such communication is? <br>  The whole joke is to amuse your amateur pride, make long-distance communication, catch DX, test equipment and gadgets to it, communicate with people and measure your temper in communication competitions! <br>  But there are a couple of limitations: <br>  - you must always observe ethics, behave appropriately on the radio, <br>  - there are 4 forbidden topics that by default cannot be discussed on the air - sex, religion, politics, and sport. <br><br>  Well, if in brief, then this action happens exactly like this. <br><br>  In particular, about the HF range: <br><br>  You all know that short waves propagate reflected from the ionosphere (the highest part of the atmosphere of the earth) and only at night - such are the teachings in universities.  In some ways, they may be right, because it is generally known that the sun strongly ionizes the ionosphere, which in turn presses the passage of radio waves of certain frequencies.  But in reality, the situation is somewhat different. <br>  In general, there are several dedicated bands for lovers: <br>  160 meters - 1.8 MHz - 1830 ... 1930 kHz <br>  80 meters - 3.5 MHz - 3500 ... 3650 kHz, <br>  40 meters - 7 MHz - 7000 ... 71000 kHz, <br>  30 meters - 10 MHz - 10100 ... 10150 kHz, <br>  20 meters - 14 MHz - 14000 ... 14350 kHz, <br>  17 meters - 18 MHz - 18068 ... 18168 kHz, <br>  15 meters - 21 MHz - 21000 ... 21450 kHz, <br>  12 meters - 24 MHz - 24890 ... 24990 kHz, <br>  10 meters - 28 MHz - 28000 ... 29700 kHz. <br><br>  Consider the ones that are used most often: <br><br>  160 meters - he worked on him a little, because  Passing there is ONLY night.  And oddly enough, only in this range are they allowed to work when receiving a callsign from the 4th category.  To be honest, I don‚Äôt know why it‚Äôs done this way, because this range causes the strongest difficulties to learn from beginners. <br>  80 meters - for a long time was an observer on this range.  The situation with the passage is better than 160m, but also, only the night passing. <br>  40 meters - passing both by day and at night, night prevails. <br>  20 meters - universal range, round the clock passage!  It was on him that I spent the farthest connection in my life!  The respondent was from the USA, from Oklahoma, communication is at a distance of 11000 km !!! <br>  15 meters and less are special ranges - they border on a critical point where radio waves no longer reflect from the ionosphere, but go off into space.  And yet, they are especially the fact that the peak of the passage of radio waves on them is associated with the 12-year cycle of solar activity (the next peak of which, by the way, falls on 2014-2015). <br>  How do I know all this you ask?  Did I have the first category? <br>  No, I had a fourth, but I worked where I wanted, without knowing Morse code.  This is undoubtedly a minus, but the thirst for knowledge, sometimes takes its toll. <br>  In general, gentlemen from IARU, it is necessary to weaken the requirements for novice radio amateurs, telecom operators, and so after all, interest in this topic irrevocably leaves every year and the development of the Internet ... <br>  That's all I wanted to say!  Successes in the development of this area and 73! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/127826/">https://habr.com/ru/post/127826/</a></p>
