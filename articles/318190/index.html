Pressing skinny and not very ass to the chairs, they flood in samopisny chatika.  Pleasure costs 6 rubles per hour (the price of "urban Internet" in the distant <br>  2000s with one server per half million city). </p><br><p>  It was enough to save on student lunches.  By accessing the Global Internet at 33 rubles (hrenase!) Per hour - no longer.  Squeak modem at 33600. Night. </p><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><p>  The most important thing is that you can go to the server via FTP and post your Yasdelieu for all to see.  Own site.  Or chat.  Or what else did you come up with?  And someone will definitely go there, look and appreciate.  And you will see it on the counter of visits (the forerunner likes size 88 √ó 31). </p><br><p>  In the technology stack (although the word ‚Äústack‚Äù was used with something like ‚Äúpush ax‚Äù), we had a lot of things: <br><br></p><p></p><ul><li>  PHP3, which has not yet had time to cheat (or managed, but in the "urban Internet" no one knew about it). </li><li>  HTML4, which not all the browsers at the time knew how to render tables. </li><li>  CSS-1.0 is magic. </li><li>  JavaScript, which lamers confused with Java. </li><li>  The sixth cup of crappy Nescafe-gold. </li></ul><br><p>  These technologies were awesome.  Literally.  For example, JavaScript could shake browser windows and open ten thousand windows, sending an unwanted chat user to the knockdown.  Current frameworks do not know how. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f3a/ac5/64e/f3aac564e6774d7fabcd788826ae85f2.gif" alt="image"><br><p>  But after a couple of years, the detractors from Java (which are not Script) came and told that everything we do is crap.  And on the server, our code is crap.  And on the customer - shit.  And our browsers are crap.  And the whole web development is crap.  However, the bitter truth in this was.  The browsers of that time were really amazing mechanisms. </p><br><h2>  Cemetery frameworks.  Start </h2><br><p>  A breath of fresh air has become the Prototype (does anyone remember this framework?).  It was so cool to write something like $ () instead of document.getElementById! </p><br><p>  Here are just Prototype expanded the functionality of the basic objects.  And it is considered shitty.  And the old man bent almost immediately, as jQuery appeared. </p><br><p>  I was angry for two days.  I liked to write <br><br></p><pre><code class="javascript hljs">$(<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"id"</span></span>).style.color = <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"#FFF"</span></span>;</code> </pre> <br>  instead

Many moved. </p><br><p>  Prototype was just the gateway to a world full of real, smelly shit!  It gushed in a stream.  In small pieces, like mootools, which for about six months actually pretended to be a competitor to jQuery and Prototype.  And in big chunks like Dojo (who remembers this ?!), Yahoo!  UI Library (Extjs in total). </p><br><p>  We needed MVC (or HMVC?), And we had a choice: Backbone, CanJS, Knockout and a dozen new ones every week.  We were tired of CSS, and again we could choose: Less, Sass, PostCss.  Someone said that JavaScript is crap, and so CoffeeScript appeared, and I was really convinced that it was necessary to write on it, for progress!  Damn, where is he now ?! </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3bf/49d/402/3bf49d402cde4a668c5595cf8c5f02b8.gif" alt="image"><br><br><p>  TypeScript.  ES6.  Great, JavaScript has become typed, but stopped working in the browser: now it had to be compiled.  And not only him.  Lots and lots of routine magic on the server. </p><br><p>  Therefore, automated routine server magic appeared by the type of Grunt, Gulp, Broccoli, Webpack.  I was turned inside out from Angular syntax, and I was glad to dance on his grave when React appeared (for which Redux was needed).  Even <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/150594/">Vanilla JS</a> , a 25-byte compressed framework, looked not so bad against the background of a common zoo. </p><br><p>  Every day there were new frameworks and libraries that solved problems that we didn‚Äôt even think about.  Every day there was something that you can learn.  We read Habr, and our eyes sparkled with happiness (or from a serotonin reuptake inhibitor).  But it didn‚Äôt take place for half a year like a new good technology, someone furiously cheating, and it became at first a sediment, and then - shit. </p><br><p>  It used to be that you start a project with new and high-tech technologies and methodologies, and you end up with slops.  Although essentially nothing has changed, except that a couple of articles appeared on the ‚ÄúWhy an angular is sucks‚Äù and ‚ÄúScrum is dead and no longer working‚Äù article.  The project, the work and even the own company seemed to settle, simply because someone said ‚ÄúMVC is for suckers!‚Äù. </p><br><h2>  Do not be chode </h2><br><p>  The truth is that most developers are violet on the project itself.  Where it is more important to feel "in trend".  Do not be chode.  Therefore, often the hipster technology - a decisive factor in the choice of work.  And very few employers admit that they are recruiting people to support a dismal project on half-year-old frameworks. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d41/60f/9c1/d4160f9c11294ccea3e01828a4b5ae0f.jpg" alt="image"><br><p></p>  In the vacancies of the studio, only those technologies that did not manage to acquire devastating reviews stick out.  We also did this and hid under the table nasty things like the best domestic CMS-systems.  Yes, we even <a href="http://blog.sibirix.ru/2013/07/29/zendframework-bitrix/">wrapped it up with Zend</a> , so that customers rejoiced at the marketing chatter about the power of the admin panel, and we used MVC, not really tormented. <p></p><br><p>  We are in a studio not in the worst position - we can experiment and change technologies like gloves.  We have an unspoken rule - try a new technology on a new project.  The stack always remains more or less relevant.  But globally it did not resolve the issue.  Not all projects end immediately after release, yeah. </p><br><p>  A variety of opinions has given rise to the problem of choosing and training junior ones.  I interviewed people who quite seriously said that they taught Angular, and not JavaScript.  Ai heyt u, agnulyar. </p><br><p>  I saw developers who thought they could write ‚Äúon jQuery‚Äù - more precisely, they can find a suitable slider and stick it onto the page.  And (I quote literally) "customize for yourself."  These people proudly called themselves "jQuery integrators", but could not sort the list of values ‚Äã‚Äãin the select box.  They were worried that they would talk about something that might be more difficult than ‚Äúplug-in integration‚Äù (more precisely, classes that for some reason they consider ‚Äúprogramming‚Äù).  When they were asked to write a bit of code on a piece of paper without copy-paste from the githab, their pores oozed with the hormones of liquefied stress. </p><br><p>  But damn it!  They are not to blame! </p><br><h2>  Do not read srachi, and touch with pens </h2><br><p>  One evening I wanted to make a small project for the soul: saytik with a simple backend and some kind of interactive Javascript.  And I decided to first look at what is now fashionable to write.  God, why did I read it ... </p><br><p>  [Development ‚Üí <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/312022/">What is it to learn JavaScript in 2016 translation</a> ] </p><br><p>  My project is not finished yet.  It seems that soon I will open a startup or start looking for a co-founder. </p><br><p>  Now in the arsenal of our studio: </p><br><ul><li>  jQuery + CanJS + Less + Gulp on some projects; </li><li>  and React + Redux + Babel + JSX + ES6 + Browserify + PostCSS + Webpack to others. </li></ul><br><p>  But I do not know how much time is left until they fall into the category ‚ÄúX - shit!‚Äù. </p><br><p>  If you are talented and gifted, you most likely have the flip side of these nishtyakov - you are too clever.  You optimize, save power.  You stop learning and trying technologies in practice.  And increasingly rely on third-party opinion.  Become blinkered.  The study and application of technology is replaced by reading a fun article on a habr about the fact that it sucks. </p><br><p>  In the smoking room, you can call technology X sludge - this will raise credibility in the eyes of colleagues and give moral right not to study it and not to use it.  From the side it looks also cool, as if you mastered the technology.  But this is not the same thing. </p><br><p>  Singularity is closer than you think.  Avoid blindness.  Rely less on someone else's opinion.  Take a look yourself.  Learn by yourself.  And try to shake this world.
