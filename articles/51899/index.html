The Internet!  He is now constantly sitting in the taskbar and there is no need to pay for traffic - turn on the site, choose a video and watch during the breaks when convenient. <br><br><h2>  Official sites of TV channels </h2><br>  The first site that became <a href="http://news.ntv.ru/">available</a> was <a href="http://news.ntv.ru/">news.ntv.ru</a> - this is really a quality-made section of the NTV television company itself, which they watch and fill from 7 am until midnight.  For all the time of observation, I was convinced of the quality and speed of filling this official site.

      But one broadcaster is not an objective review of all events.  The next good source is <a href="http://5-tv.ru/news/">Petersburg's Fifth Channel</a> , the only channel that covers the entirety of criminal reports and incidents.  True, not always promptly.  It happens all day without new plots, apparently the responsible person falls ill. <br><br>  The next place is <a href="http://www.1tv.ru/allnews/">Channel One</a> .  A lot of news for every taste, sometimes very different. <br><br>  Only on a few channels there is a viewing of news on the site in Flash format, some practice WMV, but due to the unavailability of a universal player for this format - we don‚Äôt view them, unless on the official site. <br><br><h2>  Technology </h2><br>  Information about new plots is collected from official sites on Crown every 10 minutes, with almost one request. <br>  Next comes the next script - a publisher that downloads pictures, resizes them, updates the semantic core, updates all rss-streams and publishes on the site. <br><br>  Resize technologies are described in all textbooks. <br><br>  Own development of the analysis of the semantics of all the plots is built on the phpMorphy library.  Updating the entire kernel to 10 thousand messages takes a little more than 10 seconds: all subject headings are selected, divided into words, sorted, words taken over 4 characters, a map of coincidences with the kernel compiled earlier, logarithmic significance estimates are made. <br><br>  The core is made by hand.  For example, for the theme of Barack Obama, the initial forms of words occurring in the subjects are compiled.  phpMorphy Obama declines as "Obama", so we are looking for it, and set it to +1.  This is done very simply - a map is constructed for words that are not included in the current core and interesting topics are viewed through the eyes.  For example, in the plots the city of Voronezh began to appear frequently - we included it into the core and the next new plot for it was counted hits. <br>  This technology was embodied from one's own thoughts in exactly one day, and the result exceeded all expectations - in some places it is much more convenient and clearer than categories. <br><br>  PHP engine of its own design, which is already the 4th year.  The main part of the engine is parsing the current request, loading the required plug-ins, connecting modules to requests and actually calling the module.  Static pages go immediately if the request is not in the map. <br>  The modules are written for each section and technically not a bit complex. <br>  Already a year of being on Habr√©, I want to experience the Habra effect.  Let's see how the engine will cope and what will be the maximum load on the CPU. <br><br><h2>  View news </h2><br>  Click on any plot - and at the top of the page a panel opens where the UPPOD player will be, and all data on the selected video clip.  The panel can be hidden by a switch at the bottom, the state of the panel is remembered for the entire site in a cookie - thus it can be kept permanently open or closed. <br>  Below the picture of the plot is a permalink to view, category, time of publication and the button "Add" - by clicking on it, the selected video is added to your playlist and stored in the cookie.  You can view at any time by clicking in the "play". <br><br><h2>  Teasers for sites </h2><br>  You can insert a block of the latest news on the category of interest on your website - large or small pictures, text on the right or bottom and the number of stories - all this is customizable.  The current version allows you to view news only with the transition to our website, but in the future it will be possible to view with no transition.  The whole question in "But" ... <br><br><h2>  But - this is legal content. </h2><br>  Any channel lit on the pages of the site may require removing it from the site, but it may also begin to cooperate, because additional viewers were never superfluous. <br>  News is very interesting content.  But unfortunately not everyone knows where to watch them and how to watch different news.  The essence of my project is gratuitous viewing of official news videos, without additional advertising from our side.  The project is non-commercial and created only for personal reasons.  Monetization project simply will not, because it does not make sense.  The cost of hosting is minimal, albeit palpable. <br><br>  There are a lot of cooperation options, but I repeat - that the whole project is non-commercial and the benefit from its appearance is only one - public status.  Everything else is paid out of pocket. <br><br>  For interested persons, I can advise you to monitor competitive inquiries in search engines and find TV channels with mixed ads and pop-up windows.  Such sites cause only disgust. <br><br><h2>  Development </h2><br>  There are not many options, and there are simply no plans to receive dividends from this.  But there is a huge field for the development and running-in of their technologies and approaches.  The same semantic core showed me in which direction it is possible to work on news sites of any format.  It will also be interesting if you have to store video clips on your own server (by agreement, of course) - the drive is large and the channel is narrow. <br>  There is a field for reflection on the pictures, on the way they are issued and stored. <br>  Now I am exploring the behavior of teasers for future developments, the possible targeting of plots by city depending on the city of the visitor, targeting based on search queries - all of these topics are very interesting and productive. <br><br>  Every comment will listen and try to give a detailed answer.  There is a cache on the engine, Munin is following the server and Auto Banana (there will be a release if you add karma :) <br>  <b><i>This review is published at the request of the LDEV <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/ldev/" class="user_link">habrauzer</a> .</i></b>  <b><i>He will be happy to answer all questions and comments.</i></b> <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/51899/">https://habr.com/ru/post/51899/</a></p>
