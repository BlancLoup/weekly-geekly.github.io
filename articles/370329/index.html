  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Female space landing in Australia?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Despite all the achievements in the field of communication, still a personal meeting and personal presence make it possible to better establish contact and do more than at a distance.  In addition, direct presence allows you to see more than other people write in short notes about the event.  What is it for me?  At the end of September, the sixty-eighth International Astronautical Congress (IAC) will be held in Adelaide (Australia).  From Russia there will be an official delegation, which for us, ordinary people, will not be able to keep a report exactly.  But now they are raising money to send four more girls from Russia to Adelaide.  I spoke with Anton Gromov (SpaceX editor for VKontakte and SpaceX launches broadcasts) who was at the last congress in Mexico, the girls and the main organizer of the fundraising, engineer, journalist and popularizer of astronautics Alexander Khokhlov. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f71/0d0/bff/f710d0bff03d45e480d9135708af50cd.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Anton Gromov </h2><br>  Anton went to the last congress in Guadalajara (Mexico) and was reporting from there.  It was at this event that Musk showed his <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/281040/">presentation of the</a> Mars rocket ITS, to which Anton became a direct witness.  Instead of a single broadcast, he recorded short videos: <a href="https://vk.com/wall-41152133_3820">impressions from communication with astronaut Buzz Aldrin</a> , <a href="https://vk.com/wall-41152133_3785">before the presentation Mask</a> , <a href="https://vk.com/wall-41152133_3885">impressions immediately after</a> . <br><br>  I asked Anton a few questions.

      <b>What kind of congress is it and how cool is it?</b> <br><br>  Congress is cool because it is the largest space event in the world.  At its level, only the American Space Symposium.  Accordingly, there you can meet representatives of almost any organizations.  There are all the world's major space agencies.  In 2016 there were delegations with top leaders from the United States, Russia, China, Europe, Japan, India, the Emirates, from other countries too.  This is at the main congress.  But this is probably not so important for our girls, it is unlikely that they have anything to offer to Charles Bolden.  More importantly, there are a lot of different organizations that are engaged in some kind of new developments and educational programs.  I will not remember everyone.  But even more of them should be at the youth congress, which I was not. <br><br>  <b>What did you do specifically and what didn't, the results of your trip?</b> <br><br>  Initially, I had the idea to go because of Mask.  Of course, if it was a one-day event, I would not go to Mexico for its sake.  But in the end, the impressions were such that now I will go without such a ‚Äúlure‚Äù.  I have never seen such an atmosphere that conversations about space merge into noise because of their number around.  I do not work in the space industry, so I didn‚Äôt have goals to make any business contacts, but nevertheless I met many interesting people, including those from the Space generation [ <a href="http://spacegeneration.org/">SGAC</a> , international youth space organization at the UN].  Communicated a lot with like-minded people from spaced reddit.  He even drank a little beer with a man from NASA, who gave the first contracts of SpaceX, had a rather long conversation with Zubrin and was ‚Äúsent‚Äù by Aldrin.  So it turned out to be rich, despite the fact that I confess that I was a little shy because everyone around me had business conversations, negotiated deals, and I was just a popularizer) I also spent a lot of time on technical sessions that were also informative , despite the fact that it was not all clear.  In addition to purely pragmatic things, I personally just had very strong impressions.  something like the appearance of White in outer space: the saddest moment in the world was when the exhibition was dismantled on the last day.  for me it was 5 days of happiness) <br><br>  <b>Will sending a delegation from Russia give any benefit, can they do something there, establish contacts and so on?</b> <br><br>  Some benefit, of course, will be.  It depends on the entrepreneurial spirit of the girls, I think.  In addition to reports and stories about what is there and how, they can organize some kind of international educational program in Russia, make a representative office of a cool organization, or start cooperating with foreign colleagues in some way.  They will learn a lot about who in the whole world is doing what, what organizations are, many who will get to know, learn and tell everyone about the latest developments of various agencies.  At the congress make a lot of announcements.  in 2016, they were telling news about the European mission of delivering soil from Phobos, if I'm not mistaken, details about the rover 2020, announced the purchase of a sea launch, and so on.  I remember walking on the eve of this announcement next to a girl from S7, and she called us tomorrow morning for their announcement, not to say it would be).  It is difficult to predict the outcome, but there is certainly potential. <br><br><h2>  Girls </h2><br>  Brief biographical note: <br><br>  Anastasia Stepanova. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/76e/f13/941/76ef1394137e4a3082012b2dc54e4d65.jpg"><br><br>  Journalist, student of the faculty "Mechatronics and Robotics" MSTU.

She also participated in the selection of Mars One ( <a href="http://www.ufa.kp.ru/daily/26343/3225922/">interview</a> ). <br><br>  Valeria Skuratova. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5e9/7b0/2e1/5e97b02e1d26446b8983c63a7fb37dea.jpg"><br><br>  Student BSTU "Voenmeh" them.

A participant in the Summer Space School, a teacher at the Children's University, a participant in the Parsek Lecture Hall, and an administrator of the Cosmonautics Basic Courses in St. Petersburg.  Passed practice in the rocket company "Lin Industrial". <br><br>  Daria Nemirich. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/431/f66/884/431f668847c8415eba3ad8fa5e3f21c5.jpg"><br><br>  A student of the Faculty of Biology of St. Petersburg State University, a mountaineer, a member of the youth section of the North-Western organization of the Federation of Cosmonautics of the Russian Federation, a member of the ‚ÄúSpace Generation‚Äù, a member of the Team Russia team who took 4th place in the final of the international student competition Gemini Mars Design Competition. <br><br>  Ksenia Lisitsyna. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/13b/968/655/13b96865516d42038146a048bba136ae.jpg"><br><br>  A graduate of BSTU "Voenmeh" them.  D. F. Ustinova and Universitetet i Nordland (Norway), webmaster, rock-climber, member of the North-West organization of the Federation of Cosmonautics of the Russian Federation, member of the ‚ÄúCosmic Generation‚Äù.  Participant of the Summer Space School. <br><br>  All the girls I asked the same questions. <br><br>  <b>What will be your task at the congress?</b>  <b>Do you have a specific plan for what to do every day?</b> <br><br>  <b>Anastasia:</b> We will fly to both congresses to meet new people who are interested in astronautics.  At a large astronautic congress, we will divide technical and scientific sections among ourselves in order to cover the program as much as possible.  I, as a participant in isolation experiments, are primarily responsible for them in those short reports that we will be conducting from the congress.  Of course, I will try to find many personal contacts that will be useful to me in the future.  Upon returning to Russia, we will talk about what we have seen and heard at the lectures, following the results we will assemble a video of our trip.  The congress is so big that one person will not be able to cover even a tiny bit of what is happening.  I know for sure that I plan to meet with the Martian Society of Australia, to discuss cooperation between our countries.  And we will plan the trip itself in the summer, when it becomes clear with the very fact of participation and the availability of tickets / visas.  In the summer, they will publish a program of a large and youth congress.  Then it will be possible to determine more precisely. <br><br>  <b>Valeria:</b> My task will be to prepare short but interesting reports from the sections on the architecture of space missions and the creation of rocket and space technology, as well as communication with specialists of the space industry.  I, as a graduate student of the faculty of rocket and space technology, will be able to correctly convey what congress participants will share with us. <br><br>  <b>Daria:</b> At the moment, one of my main tasks at the upcoming congress is an oral presentation with a report at the student session.  The report will be devoted to the mission, which we with the team of children under the leadership of Alexander Khokhlov designed for the Gemini Mars Competition ( <a href="https://vk.com/club91165516">more</a> ) <br>  Specifically, for the report, we stated the thesis entitled ‚ÄúThe trajectory analysis of 2021‚Äì2023 years‚Äù, which literally translates as ‚ÄúAnalysis of the trajectory and possible structure of the manned flyby mission of Venus and Mars in 2021‚Äì2023 ".  The thesis was submitted in early March, the organizers promise to carry out the selection of works until April 23.  In addition, at the congress I will attend reports on medical and biological topics and conduct short reports about them. <br>  And upon my return to Russia I will give more detailed lectures on the past event.  Specifically, there is no plan for the days, since all the speakers are still unknown. <br><br>  <b>Ksenia:</b> I am in the ranks of the Space Generation Advisory Council.  My task is to establish contacts with representatives of the space industry.  I am pleased to bring packs of business cards from trips and acquaint my colleagues who remain in Russia with foreign experts, talking about opportunities, grants and ideas.  As a software development student in Adelaide, I will focus on software used in space, space and near space research.  The plan is by day while the organizers are working.  So far only known dates for the youth conference and the annual congress. <br><br>  <b>How do you prepare for the trip?</b> <br><br>  <b>Anastasia:</b> As soon as there is clarity, I will start to connect with people from around the world from the aerospace industry and arrange meetings at the congress.  We will begin active preparation after successful completion of the project. <br><br>  <b>Valeria:</b> Now we are engaged in social services.  networks and interviews dedicated to the project.  Then we will decide in what form it is better to make reports from the congress. <br><br>  <b>Daria:</b> In early March, I wrote and sent a thesis to this conference.  So far we have just started this project, therefore, very active actions have not yet been taken. <br><br>  <b>Ksenia:</b> I constantly follow the news, meet people, maintain relationships with colleagues.  To effectively participate in such events you need to be in the know.  Basic training will begin one and a half to two months before the trip, when the list of participants becomes known. <br><br>  <b>What do you sacrifice for the trip?</b> <br><br>  <b>Anastasia:</b> To be honest ... we are!  I miss my studies a little and that's it. <br><br>  <b>Valeria:</b> What we all donate is time, for study or work, but it‚Äôs really hard to call it a victim, rather, it‚Äôs a great opportunity for us and for people who would be interested to know what will happen at the astronaut congress, plus we develop useful skills, and our project itself plays an important role in promoting cosmonautics. <br><br>  <b>Daria:</b> If you look formally, then I will miss a couple of weeks of studying at the university and music school, as well as a few mountaineering and climbing classes.  But if to look from the point of view of benefit, then to say that I donate something is not entirely correct.  The trip is very important for all of us (and for me in particular), because it will allow us to acquire new skills, experience and contacts that will later be useful at home, in the same study, for example, or in promoting space biology. <br><br>  <b>Ksenia:</b> There is no sacrifice.  Of course, the trip will take time, forces will be spent, but I take it as a job.  And work is not a sacrifice, but the use of your best skills for solving problems. <br><br>  <b>What words do you think to convince those who read these lines that you need to support you?</b> <br><br>  <b>Anastasia: It</b> is highly likely that this trip will build a long-awaited bridge between the Russian youth and the whole world.  Acquaintances and useful contacts will help in the future to send more and more outstanding guys from Russia and organize similar congresses here.  The most important thing is to understand that much depends only on us, and only we create our cosmic future! <br><br>  <b>Valeria:</b> I do not think that it is necessary to convince us to support.  We will make a report for all who will monitor our activities.  Those people who understand the value of our ideas and the effort expended will support us, and it is thanks to people like them that our world is changing.  I hope that this financing format will be supported, and we will become the guides of new ideas, we will talk about the problems and projects that are currently relevant.  After all, even if you get to the conference, you can listen to only a part of the reports, as there are often many parallel sections, and all, of course, do not have time. <br><br>  <b>Daria:</b> Regular youth in our country, no matter how sad, it must be admitted, is separated from science, apart from astronautics and astronomy.  Most do not know the names of modern astronauts, or current interesting space experiments and projects, or even the names of Russian launch vehicles and ships.  All this testifies not only to the fact that the current Russian space exploders are catastrophically lacking, but also to the weak support from the state of the educational sphere on this subject (and many others, which is no secret). <br><br>  So it turns out that everything must be taken into our own hands (in this case into the hands of the people) if you want to change this order of things.  Our task (among others) is to serve as an inspiration for the same young people as ourselves.  To make it clear that young people not only want and can engage in the popularization of science, but are also capable of doing it well. <br><br>  By our example, we will show that the Russian young generation can be part of the cosmic world science at a decent level.  And we hope once again to break the gender stereotype that girls are the weaker sex, which nothing in space can do. <br><br>  <b>Ksenia:</b> Right now I am participating in a meeting of the UN Subcommittee on the Peaceful Exploration of Space.  Every day of communication and exchange of experience here brings more knowledge and skills than a month of work at home.  I want the young specialists from Russia to have enough strength and inspiration to develop the industry in the future.  But without the help of state systems can not do.  On our trip, I want to draw the attention of Roscosmos to the need to develop affordable grants for students and specialists. <br><br><h2>  Alexander Khokhlov </h2><br>  A few more questions I asked the main organizer of the trip, the engineer-designer of space instrumentation at the Central Research and Development Institute of Robotics and Technical Cybernetics (CSRI RTK) in St. Petersburg, a journalist and a popularizer of astronautics. <br><br>  <b>Probably the most important question - why four?</b>  <b>Is not it too much?</b> <br>  With the initial planning, only the maximum benefit option was considered, that is, as now in 2017, to get the maximum effect from organizing the delegation‚Äôs visit to such an event.  At the same time, even crowdfunding was not chosen by chance, if a person spends his money, he looks at what he spends them, personal interest arises.  Therefore, we are not just sending girls to Adelaide, we are telling that, in principle, there is such an opportunity - and we urge Roscosmos to follow the example of other national space agencies and start at last to make grant programs for young people.  So far, there is only a long history of pre-history, as Roskosmos ignored such questions.  The delegation of 4 people, we solve several problems.  For sponsors, the most important thing is the opportunity to learn first-hand what is happening at these congresses.  The girls will share among themselves the program of a large congress, according to their qualifications.  Approximately Valeria will write short reviews from sections on the architecture of space missions, the creation of rocket and space technology.  Dasha about biological and medical experiments.  Nastya about the projects of flights to Mars and about insulation experiments.  Ksenia on the development of software for space missions and the training of astronauts.  There are target tasks: Dasha, as a member of Team Russia, who took 4th place in the final of the international student competition Gemini Mars Design Competition, will speak at the student section on the project of the manned flyby of Venus and Mars.  Ksenia will already be the representative of SGAC at that moment, so she will need to personally meet representatives of the organization from other countries. <br><br>  Nastya Stepanova, as a participant in isolation experiments and a journalist, will review the results of these works, which will be presented at the congress.  A separate point is that all four girls are supporters of the manned space exploration and space expansion.  Therefore, at the congress, their focus will be on a manned space program, on the future development of programs for people to fly into space.  It is important to understand that you can learn more personally than from the news and slides.  Not to mention personal connections.  I note that the girls speak English well and have a high level of communication. <br><br>  <b>Do you have any kind of interaction with Roscosmos?</b>  <b>It is clear that this year they simply will not have time to provide support, and then?</b> <br><br>  In Facebook in the discussion of our project, a dialogue with Dmitry Payson (ORKK).  The other day they, together with Sergey Krikalev (Roscosmos), were in Paris at a meeting devoted to the preparation of the 68th International Astronautical Congress (IAC).  The issue of student support by space agencies, which provide grants for a trip to participate in the congress on a competitive basis, was also discussed.  Dmitry Paison noted that congressional grants are a well-known, popular topic, and we should deal with it systematically. <br><br>  I quote: <br><blockquote>  <i>This is the direction in which you need to work.</i>  <i>The need for this approach is recognized by many.</i>  <i>But no one will grant grants "to space" to anyone.</i>  <i>We all need to understand what the structure should be and on what criteria the lucky ones can be selected.</i>  <i>In principle - IN PRINCIPLE, I‚Äôm not a decision maker here - perhaps such a question can be raised already in relation to Adelaide, and certainly in relation to Bremen and Washington.</i> </blockquote><br>  I replied to Dmitry that while ‚Äúdecision-makers‚Äù will come up with a structure, I‚Äôm trying to start ‚Äúoff-system‚Äù.  And I will be glad to support, repost, etc.  And Dmitry supported our project.  Thanks to him and all the other sponsors! <br><br>  I very much hope that our project and the successful trip of the girls will show Roskosmos that it is necessary to introduce the practice of competitive selection and send students and young specialists with interesting scientific and technical projects to speak at an international astronautical congress.  And at the same time, it is necessary to allocate individual grants to young cosmonautics popularizers. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/370329/">https://habr.com/ru/post/370329/</a></p>
