  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Gender differences on search sites</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Gord Hotchkiss, president of <a href="http://www.enquiro.com/">Enquiro</a> , explains why Google is more popular with men and about the effects of different hemispheres of the brain on online behavior. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  A recent <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/PPF/r/171/report_display.asp">study</a> conducted by PEW Internet among American Internet users revealed several interesting differences in the behavior of members of different sexes.  In his article <a href="http://publications.mediapost.com/index.cfm%3Ffuseaction%3DArticles.showArticle%26amp%3Bart_aid%3D38135">‚ÄúGender Features of Search,‚Äù</a> Gord Hotchkiss tried to analyze and supplement the results of this study with regard to the use of search engines. <br><br>  First, men are more actively using the Internet, more often go online and more often are connected via broadband communication channels.  However, age-related anomalies are observed here, because at a young age ( <nobr>18-29</nobr> years old), girls are more likely to surf the Internet than boys.  Men search the Web for information, do research and download files, and women first need to communicate. <br><br>  With regard to searching on the Internet, the differences between the sexes are gradually erased.  Back in 2003, men used search engines much more often than women (35% vs. 25%), and now there is almost no difference.  But the difference is in the other.  Men are much more likely to use <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a> than women.  The weaker sex is also a favorite search engine, but it leads completely with a small margin.

      Men are much more likely to use advanced search capabilities and run complex search queries.  They also browse search results faster and quickly choose which link to click.  Men are more likely to trust the search engine algorithm and are more likely to click on the first link among the search results.  Women behave more prudently. <br><br>  From the point of view of advertising revenues, the male audience is more profitable for search sites, because male representatives more often follow advertising links. <br><br>  Millions of years of evolution did not pass without a trace for man.  No matter where the research is conducted, there is a noticeable difference between men and women in how they navigate, view text and react to visual elements. <br><br>  Women are better suited for multi-tasking.  They feel more comfortable during the free wandering around the Web, better perceive non-standard methods of navigation, enjoy visual graphics (for example, they often watch flash intros on the site, while the man usually skips them).  A woman will gladly search every nook of the site, getting pleasure from the process, while a man, most likely, in irritation, will leave the case halfway through. <br><br>  In the case of search sites, the difference in the behavior of men and women is not so obvious, but it also exists.  According to Hochkiss, this is due to the difference in the right and left hemispheres of the brain.  It is believed that the search as a function-oriented activity is more suitable for the left hemisphere (words and numbers) than the right (emotions and intuition), that is, it is a more inherent function of a man.  Therefore, before the main audience of the search site were just men. <br><br>  Women on the search engine are forced to adapt to men's rules and use their left hemisphere.  Emotions, intuition and other functionality of the right hemisphere on the search site is practically not used. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4316/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4316/</a></p>
