  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Caliper notes</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Hello, my name is a suporter, or just a sapport, this is how my superiors called me the first half year of my work, until I finally remembered my name.  I often see topics about the discovery of new ds, questions where it is better to place servers, comments in the style of ‚ÄúRussian business is such Russian business‚Äù, etc.  This (or spring aggravation) prompted me to write this text. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I work in one company that provides hosting services, vds, server hosting and rental.  Schedule 2/2, that is, day-night-dumping-day off, change of 12 hours.  My position is not technically challenging / serious, and does not require any great IT skills, I support the first-line DC, who should be able to respond to calls and requests related to him, as well as install and connect new equipment to the rack.  Below I would like to describe the cases and moments from the practice that occur in my work, as we see them, not clients, but supporters, and what kind of clients there are and not DC.  Immediately, I‚Äôll make a reservation that 70-80% of the clients are adequate people who understand why they need a server, and what they can demand from the support, but the remaining ones ... I will describe the cases that happened during my practice below, I don‚Äôt know if anyone will be interested. <br><br>  1) 22:30 Incoming call: <br>  Hello, hello! <br>  -I Ivanov IV, my server is not available for 6 hours, what's the matter? <br>  Please state your contract number. <br>  -I have no idea, I called you my last name, see it and // You don‚Äôt think that there are a dozen of such Ivanovs in the customer database, 6 of them are hosting clients, 4 are Kolo or Dedic.  You have to try to find out when the server was approximately located or rented, what kind of contact soap it had, etc. <br>  -Your server has been disabled for non-payment. <br>  -Yes, you "have a lot of obscene words here, as a rule, most of them concern my relatives, especially mother" !!! <br>  - ... // It‚Äôs impossible to answer rudeness to rudeness with a support, we must always be polite and courteous. <br>  -Why didn't you notify me that the server will be shut down?  // We do not have a rigid payment framework, a week before the payment deadline, the client starts sending out, when day X comes the server is still not turned off, we give several days. <br>  - You were notified by mail. <br>  - That you are ‚Äúmisleading‚Äù me, there were no letters! <br>  - Do you have such a contact soap, do you watch it? <br>  -Yes! <br>  -Perhaps they hit the spam folder. <br>  -No there is nothing!  Immediately turn on! <br>  Here we go to meet the client and turn on the server for a couple of days before payment is received.  Such cases are somewhere every couple of months.  A person places or rents a server, wakes up the payment deadlines, and then with a scandal calls and accuses that we did not warn the villains and he did not receive any letters.  Himself Pinocchio, but in his opinion the company, and especially the duty support. <br><br>  2) 15:20 Request: <br>  "Please restart the server" <br>  15:25 Answer: <br>  "Server rebooted" <br>  15:40 Incoming call: <br>  Hello, hello! <br>  -Hello, the contract number ******, wrote a request to restart the server, the sites do not work! <br>  -Minute ... (I go to the KVM look) your server is on the login, responds to the keyboard, does not hang. <br>  -Young man (a client two years younger than me), don't you understand me?  I tell you again, the sites do not work!  // And here sometimes you fall into a stupor that you can answer his question why HIS sites don't work on HIS server <br>  -I can not answer your question as I do not have access to your server, and we do not support your server, see the logs. <br>  - That you didn‚Äôt reload it correctly, and you should make it work again! <br>  -Do you have no one to see the logs?  // At that time, this quip allowed himself, because the whole company is already familiar with this client who is all in the liver and, by the way, has never paid for the server on time, adoring to screaming about the fact that he is the director of a web studio with thousands of sites (for Interest as google - with a half dozen govnosaytov on Jumla). <br>  -Yes ... You broke it and you repair it! <br>  -Do you want to order a paid administration service?  // There is such, but extremely reluctant to go for it, no one wants to mess around in someone else's garbage <br>  - Why?  You broke me, you have to fix it for free! <br>  -Please write a password to the request.  // there was no mood to swear, and again, the client is always right ... In that case, Apache did not start due to the fact that someone from this web studio crookedly added a virtual host to the Apache config.

      3) 10:15 Incoming call: <br>  Hello, hello! <br>  - Hello, contract number ******, please connect me with someone from the management, I myself am a manager, we will quickly find a common language! <br><br>  4) 12:30 Request: <br>  Hello, I place you server, put component X and plug-in Y for it, why doesn't it work? <br><br>  5) Almost every day there are requests and calls like ‚ÄúI want to rent a server to make a server on it, advise which is cheaper, can you put it all in and set up, your mother will pay‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm filling out a form for renting a server, there‚Äôs an item raid, what is it? " <br><br>  6) rogues.  Surprisingly they are in the field of IT.  Not those rogues that rivet sites like send SMS, but more material.  I remember two cases: <br>  6-1) As a rule, the main clients are legal entities, and somehow a person contacted on behalf of one firm and said that the firm wants to host several servers.  When the servers arrived and made a contract, the person insisted that the contract be concluded on an individual and not on a legal entity.  For the next couple of days, he stubbornly terrorized the calls with a reminder that the contract was signed for him.  A week later, the company in which he worked contacted us, said that the person had quit and they needed access to the servers ... So the company remained without servers. <br>  6-2) There was a new client, and it was some kind of muddy, I really wanted to give him a tour to the DC, and they would set up a server with him.  As I already said, the client is always right, so they invited the client to the server room, started to show how great things are at us and the lights on the servers wink beautifully, I started to put his server in a new rack, he was just waiting for the new one to start, He really wanted to go there.  Upon arrival, he let out some five times what kind of expensive stuffing he had in his server, the cost in the outrageous act was written, the server itself looked as if it was nailing them, all beaten, the front panel on the snot, that I didn‚Äôt even understand the platform, but the rails intelovye were.  As a result, I screwed the rails, put the server into the upper part (for the short one) of the new (still empty) rack, and it starts to fly down gracefully‚Ä¶ I caught it miraculously, then I looked at the rails and saw that the slats on the balls go very slyly bent, the server just leaves the rails and falls.  Since then, I have been very carefully reviewing Intel Rails before installing the server.  The client soon took the server. <br><br>  7) razdolbaystvo.  While the company has not made its DC, it rented racks at another large DC.  Most of the customers were safely transferred to the new DC, but still some remained for various reasons in the old.  Periodically, you have to go there with one of the clients or if a server crashes on Dedik.  I even got into it several times just by pretending to be a silent felt boot without presenting any documents at all, in the same way I was dragging my old customers who forgot their passport.  Recently, in one of the topics read the author's reasoning that the availability of people in the server rooms is a double-edged sword.  Our management categorically stated that no one except the employees could get into the server rooms, only as an excursion under supervision.  There you can even grab a server from someone else‚Äôs memory rack, the main thing is to lower it lower by the guard so that you don‚Äôt see it through the window.  Even in DC, the excursions that are wildly annoying are wild when you arrive there and you are not allowed into the hall because there are a crowd of big-bellied uncles with a bored look on facial expressions that are immediately clear that they do not understand what it is all around, but nod with a clever look heads and photographed for something.  I remember along the corridor to the right server dragging serv, and to meet me such a delegation with a photographer at the head, and he unwraps me and sends back to the entrance for a walk for 15 minutes while they do their work. <br><br>  8) Install the OS.  We do not have fashionable panels where through the web interface you can put the desired OS, it is put by us manually when ordering a Dedik.  When ordering a server for free, you need to reinstall - a separate paid service.  There are cases - on Monday, the client rented a server, installed the OS, set up, everything seemed OK.  On Tuesday, the request: "I specified the wrong OS, it turns out that the software I need requires another one, rearrange it."  No question, the customer is always right, especially since a new one and it means planning long-term cooperation, we rearrange.  The next day, again, the same request, it‚Äôs already said that we‚Äôve once set it to you when ordering, sent you a meeting a second time and changed it to a different OS for free, but for the third time please refer to the price list or put it yourself through sqm, that the cries begin in the style of ‚Äúgive me back the money in full, I have not used this server yet‚Äù. <br><br>  9) 17:30 Request: <br>  "Please restart the server" <br>  17:35 Answer: <br>  "Server rebooted" <br>  17:50 Incoming call: <br>  Hello, hello! <br>  -Hello, the contract number ******, wrote a request to restart the server, the server is not online! <br>  - Just a minute ... (I look at KVM - all the rules, I ping - pinged) Your server is online, it responds to the ping regularly. <br>  -No it does not work! <br>  - I try again, pings are coming, do you not? <br>  -I do not have! <br>  - Just a minute ... (RDP-home computer, ping is on, there is a connection) We tried it from another place, ping is on, access is available, the server is exactly on the network. <br>  - Young man, don't you understand?  I have my own ping!  I try to open the site, it does not open with me! (The last word is already shouted in hysterics) <br><br>  10) PDU.  Wonderful thing, you can control the power ports remotely, each client can rebuild their own server on the power supply via the control panel, but unfortunately not everyone wants, for some it‚Äôs easier to call / write, no matter how great and quickly effective thing. <br><br>  11) VDS.  We have it, like any modern company.  Under the clouds allocated two very serious pieces of iron.  In my memory, after a year of implementation, it never fell, and there were no problems.  But there are practically no customers of this vds, no more than 20-30 will be typed up, the management has come up with very tricky tariffs, it seems that they give both the proc and the RAM normally, but the hard drive is very small, you can‚Äôt install the same Windows at the cheapest rate, since the company is booming he knows better ... <br><br>  12) 10:30 Request: <br>  "The speed does not correspond to the declared 100 megabits" <br>  10:35 Answer: <br>  ‚ÄúThere are no traffic restrictions on our part‚Äù <br>  10:37 Client added response: <br>  "The speed does not exceed 3 megabits, that you chase the guys" <br>  10:45 The answer is: <br>  ‚ÄúWe repeat once again, there are no restrictions on our part, look for the problem in yourself‚Äù <br>  10:50 Client added response: <br>  ‚ÄúOk, let me come with a laptop in ds in the evening and measure speed with you‚Äù <br>  In the evening he arrived, he measured, everything is OK, he said that it was we who specifically for the time of his arrival lifted the restriction ... <br><br>  13) 15:30 Request: <br>  ‚ÄúHello, I would like to replace the cable on the first disk of the sat, how much will it cost?‚Äù <br>  15:50 Answer: <br>  "Replace for free, let's settle the time" <br>  Replaced ... <br>  20:30 Request: <br>  ‚ÄúPlease replace the loop on the second disk‚Äù <br>  21:00 Answer: <br>  "Replaced." <br>  21:20 Customer added answer: <br>  ‚ÄúPlease replace patch cords‚Äù // We don‚Äôt feel sorry, of course, but hearing the word freebie the dude immediately decided to change what was possible for free, it‚Äôs not clear why ... <br><br>  14) 10:50 Incoming call: <br>  Hello, hello! <br>  -Hello, my name is I. Sidorov, I now stand in front of the terminal, I want to pay for your services, tell me my contract number. <br>  - Just a minute ... (google base, I do not find it) tell me again please, I can not find you <br>  Are you stupid "censored"?  SIDOROV is my last name. <br>  -Minute ... (google a second time, again empty, fall into a stupor, I write to the admin) <br>  -Are you really stupid chtoli?  What should I spend money on your phone?  Call me now and tell me my contract number! // hangs up. <br>  We still find this client after 10 minutes, I wasn‚Äôt searched because when I tried to think after a surname, why put a space, I didn‚Äôt find it ... <br><br>  15) 12:30 Incoming call from a hosting support (that day there was a force majeure, sat 1 after a night shift, the 16th hour of the shift, more than a day without sleep) <br>  -Hello <br>  -Hi, there is a potential client on the line, a server wants to order, there‚Äôs no marketer, come on you. <br>  -Ok ... hello hello! <br>  -Hello, I'm ordering a server through a form, here you have to choose a panel, a choice of direct admin and isp manager, tell me what is cooler! <br>  - ... // Here I am stuck for a minute, I am very ashamed of it ... <br><br>  16) How boring it was, rolled Windows on a test server and hooked up gigabit (here it is, plus a low-paid support, where they will give a server with a relatively normal filling, a gigabit channel, and a ciscu catalist, and if it‚Äôs good to ask for a duniper, too)  We decided to clog the channel with torrents, could not, utorrent issued that the hard drives do not cope with the load, the speed rested on them ... <br><br>  17) Servers.  The servers are different, always with affection I look at the picturesque photos of the DC where the rows of identical servers are slim and beautiful.  In principle, we can also make such fragments, such beauty is obtained when a large client drives in and delivers a dozen servers, usually we see a hodgepodge.  90% are branded, most of them are Intel and super-mixes, less often della and HP, ibm is not enough at all.  There are also nonimes, squalid Chinese cases without back panels, with the usual desktop motherboard and extremely perverted ways of fixing hard drives.  There are also old men who are gracefully shining with remnants of white, mostly yellowed with old age.  But they are rare, both because they are old and because it is expensive to install on energy consumption.  One large client somehow decided to go on the path of purchasing nonimes, a week after the delivery of the party was taken away to the guarantee somewhere 20% of the servers, sometimes some did not start right after being removed from the box. <br><br>  18) Rails.  It is often interesting what some engineers took and what guided them when they created this.  Even after so much work, sometimes there are such sets of rails with a sled, which while you collect you have to break your head, and very much begins to want to break the head to the person who invented them, but only in the literal sense of the word.  It is very funny when a client with high ambition says that he will assemble them himself, 30 minutes of cheerful seeing of gathering, with obscene language, two seemingly elementary pieces of iron are provided.  For me, the most ideal are the rails from the supermikry, I don‚Äôt understand why others cannot do similar ... They gather without a dozen small bolts that still need to be understood which ones to screw in.  Now it is already done purely intuitively, because after reading the instructions it becomes quite sad when you see in the scheme that the bolts from the package signed as ‚ÄúA‚Äù need to be twisted into holes ‚ÄúB‚Äù, and from the bag ‚ÄúC‚Äù into holes ‚ÄúD‚Äù, but in your hands you have bags signed as ‚ÄúX‚Äù and ‚ÄúZ‚Äù. <br><br>  19) 20:20 Request: <br>  ‚ÄúHello, I rent a server from you under the contract ******, I want to come to saddle those tomorrow.  server maintenance <br>  20:30 Answer: <br>  ‚ÄúThe server is the property of the company, no one except the employees can have access to it, what do you mean by maintenance?‚Äù <br>  21:00 Customer response: <br>  ‚ÄúI want to come with a vacuum cleaner to vacuum it, do you have an outlet?‚Äù <br><br>  20) Sometimes it happens on weekends in ds sits one suporter because there is no work, customers relax, hosting-support and admins are in the office. <br>  Friday 22:30 Request: <br>  ‚ÄúHello, contract ******, tomorrow we will bring a new server‚Äù <br>  Answer: ‚ÄúBring, we will wait‚Äù <br>  Saturday 14:30 Incoming call: <br>  Hello, hello! <br>  -Hello, delivery service, brought the goods, go outside to take away. <br>  Next dialogue is already on the street: <br>  - Hello, did you bring the server? <br>  -Yes (tears off the back door of the car), take it! <br>  -0_0 (two unit super micra under the file storage, they still have huge boxes with the loader tray) Can you help? <br>  -Don't you bring my work, I‚Äôll still pull my back, the guys were weary when they were loaded. <br>  -Thanks for the help!  // starting to whistle something vigorous under the respectful look of the driver, you prove that at some moments the young human body can surprise with a sudden increase in strength.  In five years, of course, this will not have to dream. <br><br>  21) 3:15 Request: <br>  ‚ÄúHello, half a year ago I placed a server with you, then in the evening I called the reported link to download the image, asked to write to the disk and connect the cd-rom by inserting this disk there, connect the cd-rom again and insert that disk again‚Äù <br><br>  22) Relations with the law.  Clients are different, there are also those (or customers of clients) who breed sites for fraud, there are those who have child pornography.  Take and turn off under the pretext of "oh you are villains of honest citizens are deceiving" or "oh you are pedophiles, castration is crying for you" we can not.  Upon receipt of the request that one of the clients is found guilty of something similar - a letter is written to him that they complain about him with a description of the claim.  Soon the client removes this site or links to illegal content.             ¬´¬ª                    .       ,              . <br><br> 23)00:20 : <br> ¬´,        ¬ª //    ,             ,     . <br><br>      ,             ,      ‚Äî       .        . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/139626/">https://habr.com/ru/post/139626/</a></p>
