      In this post I want to share my top list of <b>free</b> plugins for <i>SSMS</i> , which I used most often. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  To start with the sore ... In <i>SSMS 2005</i> , <i>Intellisense</i> support was not there and I had to write everything by hand.  The first "signs" of <i>Intellisense</i> appeared in <i>SSMS 2008</i> .  Since then, the functionality has practically not expanded.  Of course, later there appeared the highlighting of non-existent objects in the code, but it is not necessary to speak about high-quality built-in <i>Intellisense</i> even today. <br><br>  If earlier it was necessary to put cracks on paid products, now this is unnecessary, since there are a number of good plug-ins that implement the <i>T-SQL</i> hint on a fairly high level.  The first is <i>SQL Complete Express</i> , which I used to use often (the parser started behaving worse now).  The second is more functional, but more demanding of system resources. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.devart.com/dbforge/sql/sqlcomplete/download.html"><b>dbForge SQL Complete Express</b></a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/22f/44c/092/22f44c0925584d50966bc2ced56c86be.png"><br><br>  <a href="http://www.apexsql.com/sql_tools_complete.aspx"><b>Apex SQL Complete</b></a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f2e/bbd/595/f2ebbd59554d4f189a287d659018c6d4.png"><br><br>  If you work with databases, then it is quite problematic to hold in your head where these or those objects are used.  Especially when the scheme is constantly changing ... In <i>SSMS</i> there is no good functionality for finding objects, but there are a number of good plug-ins that I want to introduce. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.red-gate.com/products/sql-development/sql-search/"><b>RedGate SQL Search</b></a> <br><br>  I have been using this plugin for a long time.  Its main feature is that during the first search it saves all user objects in the local cache on the disk.  And then the search goes inside this cache.  In this approach, there are pros and cons.  A definite plus - the search happens very quickly.  The minuses appear when the scheme in the database is constantly changing and to make the search you have to regularly update the local cache and wait ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0f3/124/4ac/0f31244acf29491786a5095fc9c27eec.png"><br><br>  <a href="https://www.devart.com/dbforge/sql/search/"><b>dbForge Object Search</b></a> <br><br>  Appeared relatively recently.  Unlike its predecessor, this plugin does not cache information, but directly accesses metadata when searching.  Accordingly, we have a faster first search and do not need to think about updating the cache (the search is slow every time). <br><br>  There are, of course, minor differences between them.  For example, in this plugin there is syntax highlighting, and the previous one does not have this feature.  But the overall functionality of these two plugins is roughly equivalent: navigating through the object tree, searching by type ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/973/282/d1b/973282d1b1294650a8d496c8108edeeb.png"><br><br>  <a href="https://www.apexsql.com/sql_tools_search.aspx"><b>Apex SQL Search</b></a> <br><br>  This product, in addition to the above-described functionality, can also show dependencies and search for data by tables.  Opportunities much more, but the main disadvantage is the speed of work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/23c/5cb/86e/23c5cb86e557477aa778742a480f4caf.png"><br><br>  <a href="http://www.ssmsboost.com/"><b>SSMSBoost</b></a> <br><br>  Very good plugin that extends the capabilities of <i>SSMS</i> .  Search for objects.  Export data from <i>Result</i> to <i>Excel</i> .  Restore session with all open documents and more. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.sqlcodeguard.com/"><b>SQL Code Guard</b></a> <br><br>  This plugin also has the ability to search for objects, but it is not for this functionality that it is included in my list.  With it, you can also search for potential errors and conduct statistical analysis of the code.  Something similar already exists in <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd172133%2528v%3Dvs.100%2529.aspx"><i>Visual Studio</i></a> , but there are a few less possibilities. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/40e/742/d4d/40e742d4df424fab9bddfd3f4443e1e5.png"><br><br>  Previously, owners of <i>SQL Server Express</i> had many questions about where to get <i>SQL Server Profiler</i> ... Now there are at least two good alternatives.  The only cons in which the lack of ability to work with <i>XEvent</i> and support the analysis of graphs with deadlocks. <br><br>  <a href="https://expressprofiler.codeplex.com/"><b>Express profiler</b></a> <br><br>  The first alternative is a very worthy <i>open source</i> project. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a9b/406/c63/a9b406c6355346ee9e930c140db6efec.png"><br><br>  <a href="https://www.devart.com/dbforge/sql/event-profiler/"><b>dbForge Event Profiler</b></a> <br><br>  The second alternative has appeared recently and has more functionality.  For example, in <i>SQL Server Profiler</i> I have long lacked the ability to sort in the final trace.  In this product, this feature has already been implemented.  But if in general, too far from the convenience of work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6a8/3bf/24d/6a83bf24d967466ea3c57f5f3fe77027.png"><br><br>  <a href="http://www.sqlsentry.com/products/plan-explorer/sql-server-query-view"><b>SQL Sentry Plan Explorer Free</b></a> <br><br>  In real tasks, it is very inconvenient to analyze the <i>execution</i> plan in <i>SSMS</i> .  In my own opinion, one of the best alternatives for working with <i>Execution Plan</i> is this modest product.  The only negative in it is not full integration into <i>SSMS</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/754/45e/c58/75445ec58f5b4a48b5e11293dbbee218.png"><br><br>  <b>A small afterword ...</b> <br><br>  I hope I was able to show that comfortable work in <i>SSMS</i> is still possible.  At the moment my personal choice of plug-ins for <i>SSMS</i> : <a href="http://www.red-gate.com/products/sql-development/sql-search/"><i>RedGate SQL Search</i></a> and <a href="http://www.sqlsentry.com/products/plan-explorer/sql-server-query-view"><i>SQL Sentry Plan Explorer</i></a> . <br><br>  Consider all the abundance of paid and free plug-ins was not possible.  Therefore, if readers have the opportunity to share their list of free products, I will be glad to see your comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/272895/">https://habr.com/ru/post/272895/</a></p>
