I feel sorry for the time spent on "live journal."  With Twitter it's different, I'm here 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and I like it.  I got on Twitter by chance and did not think that I would linger for a long time.  I wanted to understand how it is possible to put the thoughts in 140 characters?  And now, after 3,000 tweets, I can say that I didn‚Äôt understand the meaning of this wonderful service that makes millions of people happy :) <br><br>  At the very beginning I wondered what all these ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù people are doing here, and who are they?  Now I can say that many of them have become my friends, and I am grateful to Twitter for that.  But, despite the fact that I still have a lot to tell, today I want to tell you about 12 ways to do good on twitter.  So, let's begin. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  0. Retweet </h4><br>  The first and perhaps the easiest way to do good on Twitter is Retweet.  Retweet is also how to say, ‚ÄúI like what you said, I want my readers to know about it!‚Äù The uniqueness of retweet is that no matter how many times you do it, you can always see who the author is.  And very often this leads to the fact that people begin to ‚Äúfollow‚Äù the source of information, that is, to read the author of the unsubscribe message.

    <h4>  1. Replies (mentions) </h4><br>  It would seem that such a common thing on Twitter is the answer to someone's message.  Some may even be offended if you leave them unattended.  But you still have a few hundred readers.  But if there are tens of thousands?  Here, a simple ‚Äúanswers‚Äù ‚Äã‚Äãprocedure can turn into a real work with a 24 hour work day in order to have time to answer everyone.  And here, even for those who have a lot of free time, the fact of an ‚Äúanswer‚Äù to your message, there is a true manifestation of kindness and attention, is the same as the rule of good form.  A good example for the rest, when a celebrity does not hide behind the lack of free time and finds an opportunity to pay attention to the simplest reader.  Thousands of people come to Twitter precisely for this magical reason. <br><br><h4>  2. Sheets </h4><br>  The recent innovation, ‚ÄúLists", has become a cool feature of Twitter. Sheets have become an excellent tool for assessing your real popularity to her. But not only for that. It is sometimes useful to look at the names of the sheet to which you were added. but also noted in the sheet, it tells how important your opinion and the information you share.Qualitatively compiled thematic sheet can replace the news feed of the information agency with a given topic.Adding to the "sheet" is a double manifestation  good tweet. <br><br><h4>  4. Presentation </h4><br>  Quite a rare manifestation of goodness on Twitter, this is the presentation of someone to his readers.  Sometimes it can give an amazing effect.  We do not get for money and do not extract any benefits, but by introducing someone we are really doing a good deed. <br><br><h4>  5. Development </h4><br>  More and more people come to twitter every day.  And regardless of your experience, how many times you have explained and helped your friends get on Twitter, you may have to do it again and again.  And you really do a good deed, if you help, again and again.  Help them, using their own experience, without a stereotype, understanding that everyone is looking for something different.  Take the time to make the person more confident and get all the answers.  Believe me, this kindness will return to you tenfold.  Care and attention to your readers once again shows that you are a real person and a true source of inspiration and development.  Just start helping, find out where your e help can come in handy. <br><br><h4>  6. Reciprocity </h4><br>  Most, for some reason, take mutual friendship on Twitter for granted.  They even demand that they be answered, they are read and retweeted.  But reciprocity is a kind of kindness that Twitter has.  You can show how important a person is to you or what he does by simply answering him in return.  Especially if you have more than tens of thousands of readers.  Here you will be helped by numerous programs that will help you keep track of your various categories of their readers.  Many say that reading a big tape is impossible.  This is true.  Create different character sheets, read them.  Reciprocity is what makes twitter truly good. <br><br><h4>  7. Automatic messages </h4><br>  This is the bane of twitter.  Well really, which of us did not receive these silly messages in a personal box?  How much more terrible could you thank the person you just added as a friend, than to send you an automatic message, ‚ÄúThank you, blah blah blah‚Äù?  The worst thing is that not only bots, but real people do this, thinking that they will gain time for it.  Friends, if you want to prove yourself on Twitter from the good side, stop sending auto messages!  Instead, I propose to spend time and write a truly personal message from your new reader to him.  If you understand that you simply do not have time to unsubscribe personal messages to all new friends, it is better to stop doing this than to use the mailing list.  In return, you can thank them in a public message.  This will show that you noticed them and are grateful that they began to read you. <br><br><h4>  8. FollowFriday </h4><br>  Perhaps this is the kindest idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãTwitter, although the most discussed.  FollowFriday, or Friday Tracking, was a Twitter hit.  This day, many use to promote their friends or to share an interesting source of information.  But, over time, this good idea, in many ways turned into spam.  It is only in the series of names to put the hashtag #FollowFriday or #FF, as your message begins to demand to attract attention.  It simply irritates many, but suits many.  In any case, to tell people why exactly they should read the person you represented, there is a greater kindness than a simple enumeration of nicknames. <br><br><h4>  9. Constancy </h4><br>  Probably the most difficult thing is to constantly stay in communication with people and really show interest in them.  To return the time they spend on you, being your readers.  There are many people who constantly watch over others, reading you every day, everything you write, so you don‚Äôt even know it.  Of course, we can understand who is following us, but we hardly know for sure who is waiting for our every tweet.  But be sure there are many grateful followers who read you but never say anything.  Try to reach them and make them part of your community.  Involve them in what is happening with you and with you.  A true manifestation of kindness on Twitter is constant communication with people and preventing old friends from falling into the shadow of new followers.  No matter how much you add every day, how many things follow you, for whoever wants is looking for money, isn't he? <br><br><h4>  10. RTday </h4><br>  It will not be very modest, but I will tell you about my contribution to the tradition of goodness on Twitter.  When I first started using this service, I noticed that it is something very different from all that I knew before.  I quickly realized that Twitter was a good service.  He is so created.  Other circumstances may play a role, but this is so.  I rarely see rudeness or evil on Twitter. <br>  And I wanted to contribute to this kindness.  I really like the opportunity to share an interesting message that runs through my tape with one click.  And I thought that it would be a good tradition that would set the tone, set an example, mark such a day, I called it RT Saturday.  Although many people have their own associations with this word, but I tried to suggest that people on this day (every Saturday) spend a little more time on retweets than usual, it is possible to delve into my tape and find those whom you have never quoted.  That would be a really good tradition.  By adding the #RTday hashtag, you are doing one more good deed - helping to create traditions. <br><br><h4>  11. Smile </h4><br>  And the last thing I would like to share with you.  You have repeatedly met on Twitter a wish for a good morning or afternoon.  Many transmit or try to convey their emotions.  Modern social networking has presented an amazing variety of characters that convey our emotions.  And the most important of them, for many years now, is a smiley face.  Smile more often to your followers, be a kind and cheerful evangelist :) <br><br><h4>  And finally, one more sentence. </h4><br>  Good can begin to create right now.  Of course, you can‚Äôt participate in FollowFriday or #RTday right now (just because it's Sunday).  But, you can tell people about this article. <br><br>  After all, the most important thing on Twitter is to help people do good by themselves.  Therefore, if you tell your followers about this article, then there will be more good tweet.  (There is a ‚ÄúSend to twitter‚Äù button right under this topic. Or you can visit me ( <a href="http://twitter.com/Neznashka">@Neznashka</a> ) and retweet the message from there. As you prefer.) <br><br>  <b>PS</b> Thanks to my friends <a href="http://twitter.com/kuuuzya">@Kuuuzya</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/ekozlov">@ekozlov</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/korobkov">@korobkov</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/mashadrokova">@mashadrokova</a> for help in the design and proofreading of the text, as well as for clever thoughts, without which I could not cope. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/98212/">https://habr.com/ru/post/98212/</a></p>
