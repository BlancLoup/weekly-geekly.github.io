      On last.fm, anyone can create a label with your name and write there what he wants, vote for photos that he thinks are suitable for the artist, create descriptions, and so on.  And all this continues even if you are the owner of the label. <br>  Therefore, anyone who does not want his last name / label on last.fm stabbed to the left, must immediately do it himself (Valery Leontiev, for example, has already flown by). <br><br>  On jamendo all your hands, the album will not be published until you put a link on your site (and for each album a new validation) until you choose a license until you fill at least 70% of the data on the published material.  And all this is checked manually, the album is not published automatically, only after a manual check, (my second album was published after 4 days). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <strong>Secondly, you will be noticed.</strong> <br><br>  On the old-fashioned but very tortured and not at all social realmusic.ru it is very difficult to find something worthwhile. <br><br>  In the tops, there are usually some vulgar ones, sometimes even singing karaoke songs.  for which crowds of friends are voting, look here in a heap of pearl dung, of which there are plenty, by the way. <br>  The usual thing when you write in the comments something like: well done 5 go and you to us. <br>  It is also very difficult to find something on promodj.ru. <br>  It's easier on russianpofcasting.ru, you can publish to podsafe music and flip one tape to yourself;  But this is certainly a voice publishing service. <br><br>  On jamendo, after the album has been published, your album with a picture of 200 * 200 stands on all pages, until the next batch, there is time to listen to new items, and not to rummage through the minutely arriving stream. <br><br>  <strong>Thirdly, it is convenient to publish.</strong> <br><br>  At first glance, jamendo is a little untidy, but you quickly get used to it. <br><br>  Almost everything is translated into Russian. <br><br>  As on last.fm, you can create two accounts, a label administrator-listener and a musician directly. <br>  But label management is not loaded separately, but simply on the next tab. <br><br>  For each parameter, the percentage-color filling scale, red means something else needs to be added, otherwise it will not be published. <br><br>  Music is pumped into p2p using a tool that is installed in the system.  And you can not upload MP3, only wav, flac or aiff. <br><br>  There are album insert presets on sites and blogs for wordpress2, myspace, blogger.com, opera community, dotgear as well as xhtml and html. <br><br>  <strong>Fourth, it is convenient to listen and pleasant to chat</strong> <br><br>  There is a separate pop-up player in which you can create your own playlists, call them as you please, and drag each interesting or in-game playlist there. <br>  Playlists are also published on the first page. <br><br>  Separately, you can add target albums to your favorites. <br><br>  There are five kinds of blog widgets where you can plug in either a playlist or a favorite. <br><br>  Of course, this is far from everything, there is still such a Spiral chip, there is a display of how many people are from and from which country is present, and so on. <br>  But most of all I was pleased with the photo of the team that is working on the project, I did not see this in any dvolevoj service))) <br><br>  PS / Russian there is not enough)))) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/7189/">https://habr.com/ru/post/7189/</a></p>
