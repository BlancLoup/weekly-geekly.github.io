How 5 years later I started using the Motorola phone again</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/412/a27/75f/412a2775f0f24c15a3b12c0bd3ab2276.jpg" align="left">  This article is not a traditional review of the next Android background.  These are just margin notes after a three-week use of the phone, the brand of which I was very impressed with in the past.  There will not be unboxing, comparison with other models, tons of photos from different angles, benchmarking and other charms of mobile-review.  But there will be a lively review from the user who skipped the fifth version of Android and replaced the old slower device with a new fast and beautiful smartphone. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  First impression </h4><br>  They say that people meet on clothes.  I think that phones are also possible;) My new Motorola X Play comes with three variants of outerwear at once.  There are three back covers in different colors: white, orange and green.  I chose green and am very pleased that there is an opportunity to decorate the phone without additional covers, changing the native part.  It looks very bright and fits well with my backpack. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Photo with a backpack.</b>  <b class="spoiler_title">Hello to all owners of the same backpack;)</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a22/77a/0f9/a2277a0f9a584aac9d7e2170d8cdde16.jpg"><br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Here are two more panels</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ac3/08b/d62/ac308bd62fdf4fd1a493a92de618966c.jpg"><br></div></div><br>  After my HTC with android 4.0.4 and constantly ending Motorola memory (by the way, after buying Lenovo, they made a small rebranding, and now they are just Moto, not Motorola), it was felt like a racing car.  Everything flew, pictures on the phone's memory were generally recorded instantly.  In general, heaven and earth.  First impressions are purely positive, and then the most interesting thing began: the nuances during longer use. <br><br><h4>  Everything in order or first collisions </h4><br>  I first discovered that there is no external charging indicator.  It seems to me a flaw, but not critical.  Now I'm used to it.  The second moment that surprised me was that the phone could not find a home Wi-fi network.  Changed the channel, and everything was OK.  It seems to me that for those who do not know that the router is not just a box, but also some software entrails that can be twisted, the problem is quite critical.  However, I did not notice anything particularly serious except for this wi-fi problem.  The panel began to play a little bit lightly, is this probably also serious?  I do not know;) But the panel is very soft to the touch, especially the notch where the icon is "M".

    <h4>  Brief description of the phone from the wife </h4><br>  It often happens that in the car, when I'm driving, I ask my spouse to do something on the phone.  I asked to write down one moment about the phone, but I had a personal small epic. <br><br><blockquote>  It works fast, great screen, vidosiki pulls in the highest quality, fire.  Sensitive, easy to type.  Cool replaceable rear panels.  Nostalgia for old moto times. <br><br>  But once upon a time Maria Sharapova advertised Motorola. Now they are both not in fashion, but still the phone is cool, it works fast. </blockquote><br>  That says it all. <br><br><h4>  Let's go further, what else is interesting </h4><br>  In fact, some of my interesting comments will not be about the manufacturer, but about the 6th android.  So in the comments you can write to me that this feature and I have, etc.  The first thing I liked and what the phone immediately notified me with the help of a hint is the qr-reader built into the camera.  I always did not like individual applications.  You rarely use them, and here again a complementary feature to the camera.  Very comfortably.  Especially considering how the camera starts.  The gesture is hard to describe, but I will try. <br><br>  To start the camera, you need to rotate it twice with a brush, after which the phone vibrates a little and starts the camera.  A kind of prevention of tunnel syndrome!  There was also something to be taken in the office;) I don‚Äôt always remember about this feature, but I think after a couple of months I‚Äôll just get the phone to make a photo. <br><br><h4>  What with the camera, how to shoot </h4><br>  In fact, I am a very unpretentious user.  If only the camera was good, two SIM cards, the battery did not sit down quickly, but the memory did not end.  And, well, still, so that applications are properly installed.  About the camera.  Of course, she was pleased.  And not only me.  Here, look at the comments in Instagram. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a47/6d9/bf7/a476d9bf79c24cc7af3416f2749e6efb.jpg"><br><br>  There are brightness settings, which is very convenient in low light, you can shoot by pressing anywhere on the screen.  So, it turns out, really more convenient. <br><br>  Here is another photo that I inserted into the present I recently spoke with, and there was a very good response from the audience to it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/555/eb8/d7f/555eb8d7fbd2463d88b380201d9aa6e8.png"><br><br>  And this is from the last trip to Riga.  I think that's all.  Enough to overload the page traffic. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/427/777/56d/42777756d01541f4a991c6d73b3cb45a.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Daily use </h4><br>  To be honest, I thought that 5.5 screen is a lot and not needed.  Now I do not think so.  With my thumb I reach almost to all places.  Sometimes it is not possible to poke into the keyboard language switch, but the main thing is that there is enough for texts.  The screen is very bright and juicy.  The sun in St. Petersburg is now small, but yesterday it cleared up and seemed to be chatting with someone on the embankment, and nothing blinked and dimmed, everything was clearly visible. <br><br>  The phone turned out to be too heavy and thick, but these are normal, if you don‚Äôt know that there are subtle analogs))) I‚Äôm used to it now and I‚Äôm not embarrassed by the physical characteristics.  I also noticed an interesting feature that smart input began to offer phrases from stable expressions or just remembered my phrases.  In general, we were surprised when he suggested something to us. <br><br>  I also thought that the Internet shutdown button was in 6 clicks and I was indignant for a week, but a friend suggested to me how this can be done quickly.  I was pleased that in the 6th android the flashlight is no longer a separate application, but is also built into the quick launch.  The principle of operation of two SIMs differs in comparison with my old phone.  When you call, she asks which SIM card to call and offers to remember the choice for this number.  I don‚Äôt know what will happen when I call from Sims, for which there is no money.  This is about the case if I dial the number for which I memorized the first SIM card, for example.  I hope the developers took care of this. <br><br>  Battery capacity 3630 mAh.  Of course, not Xenium without bells and whistles, which holds for a week, but during the day, even with very active use, the battery lived through the night.  It is very pleased.  I noticed one more thing that I didn‚Äôt have time to do and ask around on the forums whether you can turn it off.  In the car, when you go, the screen with the clock is constantly activated.  And not only on the bumps, it was made, apparently, for the convenience of viewing the time so as not to press anything.  But in the car, this feature is rather a minus. <br><br>  I am also pleased with some features of Android 6. How, for example, do not disturb.  Very convenient for meetings, meetings.  At night you can, for example, turn off on a schedule.  Previously, I used IFTTT for these purposes.  And now out of the box.  But this is not about the phone. <br><br>  And also the phone has a good quality sound in the speakers and a fun introduction when turned on.  I wanted to find a gif, but something does not look like it is not in the public domain. <br><br><h4>  Total </h4><br>  This is my 4th phone of this brand.  I was interested in using it because I used to be a Motorola fan.  I will never forget the cool sound of E398!  I am glad that they finally entered the Russian market.  I am pleased with the phone, and not only me!  During the last week I had a chance to talk with two foreigners.  So they both praised the device.  One Hindu, another Finn.  It was unexpected.  And it is also interesting that I began to use the ipad less often.  Now, many conveniences, such as viewing vidos on the way, can be performed on screen 5.5.  It is quite comfortable. <br><br>  Can I buy something for the same money from another manufacturer?  Sure you may.  It can be cheaper.  And everyone chooses something of their own.  I've chosen Motorola.  By the way, tell me if you stopped at any one brand?  Or each new android phone with a new manufacturer?  Interesting!  And, as always, a poll for last. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/372797/">https://habr.com/ru/post/372797/</a></p>
