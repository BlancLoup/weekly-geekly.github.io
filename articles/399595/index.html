The appearance on the market of the entire line of headsets HyperX led to reasonable and quite adequate questions on the topic: "What to choose?".  Under the cut I will tell and show everything.  Even with pictures. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/365/6ec/b84/3656ecb842be460395ba03c19cb23b6b.jpeg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  First I want to note that in two years HyperX presented 7 models of the Cloud series headsets.  I chose two popular new items and two "veterans" who have already managed to "take over the world." <br><br><ol><li>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/ulmart/blog/248374/">HyperX Cloud</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/260880/">HyperX Cloud Core</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/kingston_technology/blog/282488/">HyperX Cloud Stinger</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/kingston_technology/blog/278982/">HyperX Cloud Drone</a> </li></ol><br>  Links to reviews on GeekTimes have been added to the list, everything you knew was told to you.

      Now we will understand in detail why so many different options and how to choose? <br><br><h2>  Option one: from the wallet. </h2><br>  Each headset has its own price positioning and will find its buyer, how thick the wallet would be in its pocket. <br><br>  Here I propose to go on budget models up to 7 000 rubles (prices are recommended). <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://hyperx.gg/GeektimesPoker">3 990 rubles</a> - HyperX Cloud Drone </li><li>  <a href="http://hyperx.gg/GeektimesPoker">4 990 rubles</a> - HyperX Cloud Stinger </li><li>  <a href="http://hyperx.gg/GeektimesPoker">5 990 rubles</a> - HyperX Cloud Core </li><li>  <a href="http://hyperx.gg/GeektimesPoker">6 990 rubles</a> - HyperX Cloud </li></ul><br><h2>  Option Two: by functionality </h2><br>  Now open the topic.  The step between the headsets is small, the choice is wide.  How not to get lost in them if you have a clear understanding of why you need a gaming headset (except for the fact of owning a HyperX device)? <br><br><hr><br><h3>  HyperX Cloud Drone </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5ee/889/dbe/5ee889dbecbf4773ac54ef10f4dc5c76.jpg"><br><br>  Drone is HyperX's most affordable gaming headset.  Maximum usability, light and comfortable design.  "Entry ticket" to the great world of network games and communication with colleagues.  In order to please yourself with a headset for games, you do not need to spend a lot of money - HyperX Cloud Drone is available to everyone. <br><br>  The main task is to accurately and accurately reproduce the sound atmosphere in games, in terms of everyday life Drone is ideal.  Everything is done for ease of use and convenience - the volume control is built into the cup, the microphone is turned off just by lifting it up, by the way, the microphone is pointing and no extraneous sounds will break through the air.  HyperX Drone weighs only 220 grams, and therefore will not strain with long use. <br><br>  In the segment of up to 4,000 rubles, there is simply no better option to buy a device.  Of course there are nuances, for example, there is no wire braid, but this, as they say, does not affect speed. <br><br>  <i>Another feature - HyperX Cloud Drone is available only in Russia (from the CIS countries) and only in the DNS network and its cost is <a href="http://hyperx.gg/GeektimesPoker">3,990 rubles</a> .</i> <br><hr><br><h3>  HyperX Cloud Stinger </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/628/643/9b1/6286439b19324c068a599f1e06effd1b.jpg"><br><br>  Stinger - the next step on the stairs, certainly focused on fans of games, but at the same time close to the mass market participant.  The musical qualities of the headset are significantly better than those of the HyperX Cloud Drone.  To listen to music, you can use it as a main monitor, despite its positioning as a device for gamers.  After all, gamers also listen to music. <br><br>  Otherwise, HyperX Cloud Stinger is a collective image from many other relatives - a microphone, like the flagship Revolver, matte surfaces like in the Core series, a built-in cup volume control like a Drone.  Very comfortable swivel cups will help to closely monitor the situation at home, and not just in the game, and this functionality is also sometimes needed;).  In addition, the headband is reinforced with a steel plate to make the headset more reliable.  Weight increased slightly - up to 275 grams. <br><br>  The ear cushions are filled with branded polyurethane foam with a memory effect, which means they fit exactly to your head. <br><br>  All together it turned out very nice and for affordable money - up to five thousand rubles. <br><br>  <i>HyperX Cloud Stinger is exclusively represented in the DNS for <a href="http://hyperx.gg/GeektimesPoker">4,990 rubles</a> .</i> <br><hr><br><h3>  HyperX Cloud Core </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bc7/7c7/8d3/bc77c78d387b4a6b82f87e329e050aba.jpg"><br><br>  Cloud Core is just like Cloud or Cloud II only without any goodies in the kit, so to speak, the quintessence of sound at no extra cost.  It would be more correct to tell about the first Cloud and then say what is missing in the kit.  "Excesses" like replaceable ear cushions or carrying case are missing, which favorably affects the price.  We can say only good things about sound, I would even use the HyperX Cloud Core just as headphones, but the headset has more functionality. <br><br>  All that the buyer receives is an extension cord and a removable microphone, but the sound quality will remain at the highest level.  For the second year in a row, Cloud Core hit sales and the New Year holidays will once again confirm this status. <br><br>  <i>You can buy HyperX Cloud Core for <a href="http://hyperx.gg/GeektimesPoker">5,990 rubles</a> in all Russian stores that are HyperX partners.</i> <br><br><hr><br><h3>  HyperX Cloud </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/19b/e8b/fb1/19be8bfb1e5c41f5b83deb1b291132ee.jpg"><br><br>  Cloud, just Cloud - the firstborn, the founder of the entire kind of headsets HyperX, but to call him a dinosaur or even some Pithecanthropus language does not turn.  Still relevant, cool sounding and very comfortable headset.  The hero of his time over the past two years simply takes places in the charts, except that the price in rubles has slightly increased, but the reason is the currency rate. <br><br>  Significantly richer set than the Core, includes: a microphone, carrying case, interchangeable velor ear cushions, an adapter for use in an airplane or Sapsan, a remote control for volume control.  By the way, the microphone is removable, that is, with a flick of the wrist, the headset turns into elegant headphones! <br><br>  <i>The recommended retail price is <a href="http://hyperx.gg/GeektimesPoker">6,990 rubles</a> in all HyperX partner stores in Russia.</i> <br><br><hr><br>  Important!  All headsets are compatible not only with computers, but also with mobile devices, and are sold STRICTLY at recommended prices.  Guaranteed all four models are represented in the DNS network, which is widely represented in the territory of the Russian Federation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d2a/22c/de5/d2a22cde5a3c4f419cccd5ec2f886ff9.jpg"><br><br>  By the way, recently, during a press conference at Igromir, Mark Liem, general manager of HyperX, vice president of marketing for Kingston Technology, said that a wireless headset will be introduced in 2017, although what design and features are kept secret.  We will keep you posted. <br><br>  Stay with <b>Kingston</b> at Geek Times! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/399595/">https://habr.com/ru/post/399595/</a></p>
