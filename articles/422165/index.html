  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Who should Microsoft customers switch to the Dynamics 365 version?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pm/dx/oe/pmdxoeo4vzsy68cbi0qwj56v6hs.png" align="right">  Dynamics 365 is a new integrated product from Microsoft that combines Microsoft ERP solutions (AX and Nav) and Dynamics CRM.  And this is a product that caused quite a heated discussion and disputes even before its release, and most marketing materials spoke about technological advantages that are not so easy to translate into the language of business. <br><br>  Let's try to make a small review for those industrial enterprises that have thought about changing their current system (it could be Axapta 3.0 or Microsoft Dynamics AX 4.0, 2009 or 2012 - our experience says that the entire product line is represented on the Russian market) on Microsoft Dynamics 365 Enterprise Edition. <br><br>  The review concerns industrial enterprises and therefore is rather subjective.  To make it more substantive, we analyze the main advantages of the new system, which are voiced in marketing materials, and we will assess whether our enterprises need them. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><blockquote>  <i>1. You get not only ERP-system, but also CRM.</i>  <i>Although these are products of the same company, earlier with the integration of Microsoft Dynamics AX and Microsoft Dynamics CRM, it was necessary to be ‚Äúconfused‚Äù, and in Dynamics 365 these products are really integrated and open from a single interface.</i> </blockquote><br>  The advantage is relevant for new customers who need ERP and CRM functionality, but for existing customers, plus doubtful ones.  If the company really needed a CRM system, then most likely it implemented it and even integrated it with AX.  And the vendor of both systems could be different, and not just Microsoft - in this part of Dynamics 365 is not so flexible and does not give a choice.

    <blockquote>  <i>2. Deploying in the cloud ‚Äî Microsoft is true to its slogan ‚ÄúMobile first, cloud first‚Äù and in this product.</i> </blockquote><br>  From the experience of working with Russian customers, we can say that the majority seeks, on the contrary, to control everything and keep their data on servers, which they can physically reach very quickly.  Phrase: ‚ÄúThe cloud is cool, no need to equip the server, think about the obsolescence of equipment, keep admins,‚Äù - you can rather hear from the IT-director than from the general.  And the location of servers outside of Russia creates known difficulties. <br><br><blockquote>  <i>3. Mobile workplace - now users in any part of the world can get convenient access to the system through applications on a smartphone or tablet (not only through Windows, but also iOS, Android).</i> </blockquote><br>  This is a definite plus - both for employees, who are constantly traveling, and for employees of the warehouse, who are easier to complete, looking at their phone.  But, firstly, if you want to install the same AX 2012, for example, on a tablet or phone, you can, and secondly, all tasks requiring mobile access were solved by other bypass maneuvers. <br><br>  Mobile access has another definite plus - it is useful for decision makers and evaluating project results.  If you tell the general that he can rest on Maldives, check on the phone how much goods have been shipped, whether the production plan is being fulfilled, what the percentage of marriage is for the last week, if there is no budget overrun, etc., then this will be an emotional argument for the transition. to this system.  Although the same tasks are solved by other cheaper methods (for example, you can give your assistant a command to send reports on the state of affairs from the AH to the post every day), but the feeling of control is more complete and pleasant. <br><br><blockquote>  <i>4. ‚ÄúStart with the most important, and then develop‚Äù - the system is flexible, you can connect only the functions you need and pay only for them.</i> </blockquote><br>  This is a very cool feature for new customers, but not for old customers.  The redundancy of Microsoft Dynamics AX, of course, scares users, especially when they first met, but this is solved by simply setting access rights for specific roles.  Perhaps there will be a tangible advantage in the cost of licenses, but if you have already implemented AX, then the cost of licenses is not a problem for you, and you will hardly want to cut down on any opportunities to reduce the monthly payment. <br><br><blockquote>  <i>5. Transition from feature sets to workspaces made for specific tasks.</i> </blockquote><br>  It was necessary to read that earlier versions of the system were a set of functions with process elements, and the uniqueness of Dynamics 365 is that the processes are based on it - employees use work areas designed specifically for their processes, this is convenient and correct. <br><br>  But the argument is quite controversial - after all, the implementation of an ERP system can be considered successful if processes are built, and integrators take big money not for giving a list of instructions for individual functions.  Regardless of the interface, you can ensure that all employees clearly know and fulfill their roles in particular processes.  And even workflow (which, by the way, is in AX 2012) is only one of the tools in work. <br><br>  In Dynamics 365, besides workflow, there is another great functionality - task flow.  Now you can set and track the execution of tasks by specific users.  And the ERP-system gives its recommendations and tips to users: upcoming meetings, deals without actions, mentioning competitors, etc.  At the sight of this magnificence, the soul rejoices and wants to quickly sit down for such a workplace, but you understand that most of these features are available in cheaper specialized programs and you should not switch to a new version of the product for their sake.  But when selling Dynamics 365, you can confidently say that no third-party document flow is no longer needed. <br><blockquote>  <i>6. Cortana Intelligence Suite - built-in machine learning technology.</i> </blockquote><br>  One more function, when meeting with which you involuntarily begin to imagine how you will surf the space on a ship controlled by Dynamics 365. Demand prediction, relationship analysis, resource optimization, product recommendation and even sentiment analysis in statements is the area of ‚Äã‚Äãapplication of embedded intelligence in the new system very wide.  This is one of the features for which, together with several others, you can go to Dynamics 365. <br><br>  But before that you need to mature.  Unfortunately, for many industrial enterprises, the tasks of the series ‚Äúhow to make supplies supply what is indicated in the documents, rather than what is more convenient for them,‚Äù rather than ‚Äúidentify patterns in equipment breakdowns in order to carry out its maintenance, are more relevant‚Äù ". <br><br>  You can list many more advantages of Dynamics 365: convenient web-interface, Common Data Model, integration with Office 365, PowerApps, major improvements in functionality in terms of sales and marketing, project management.  But I think the main idea will be the same: it‚Äôs not worth going over to everyone at Dynamics 365 en masse. <br><br>  <b>And who should think about this:</b> <br><br><ol><li>  If, when reading the description of a new product, you understand that you really need most of the described functions (not one or two, but at least a dozen);  if you realize that the qualifications of your employees are enough to work with these new features, then you will have direct access to the Dynamics 365 fanclub. </li><li>  If it's 2018 now, and you have AX 3.0, problems with 64-bit operating systems and constant thoughts that it‚Äôs time to take a step into the future, then you only need to consider Dynamics 365. </li></ol><br>  The rest should probably wait a bit.  Microsoft has its own vision of the future and enough resources to drag us all into this future.  But it‚Äôs never too late to switch to Dynamics 365, and the end of AX 2012 R3 support is also the year 2023.  It is better to look at the results of other implementations, to decide when the information will be more. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/422165/">https://habr.com/ru/post/422165/</a></p>
