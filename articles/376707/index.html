They are intended primarily for professionals 3D-modeling and design. <br><br>  We tested the older model of the line - <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/kupit-3d-gadjet/spacepilot-pro.html">SpacePilot Pro</a> and we hasten to share our results. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/45b/4ba/c63/45b4bac63dd94c51b96ab923b1397100.jpg">

    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Appearance</b> <br><br>  Manipulator <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/kupit-3d-gadjet/spacepilot-pro.html">Spacepilot Pro</a> makes a positive impression at first glance.  The weight of the mouse turns out to be unexpectedly large for its size, but it was done on purpose: thanks to this, the device is securely fixed on the table and does not move even with the most active use. <br><br>  The case resembles a car dashboard - soft matte plastic, pleasant to the touch, a joystick manipulator surrounded by a set of buttons, an LCD screen.  The younger models of the line do not have a screen, but they look no less impressive.  In general, everything looks good and fits into the workplace. <br><br>  <b>Ergonomics</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2d7/4f7/4a6/2d74f74a61cf47778614c8b6aeb33b06.jpg"><br><br>  Having tested the mouse in 3ds Max, SolidWorks and Maya, we concluded: the hand on this mouse is like a glove.  Brush support is weak, but not required.  Keystrokes are mainly made with the thumb and little finger, and for this almost no need to move the brush.  They are located carefully, and after a little getting used to, you quickly start working without looking. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/070/5a9/4d1/0705a94d14d4424d96074401412b5c09.jpg"><br><br>  The navigation joystick is rubber-covered, holding onto it comfortably.  The manufacturer recommends to equip the workplace in such a way as to work with a <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/kupit-3d-gadjet/3d-mouse/">3D mouse</a> with a hand free of a conventional mouse.  Since the manipulator is symmetrical along the longitudinal axis, it is up to you to work comfortably with both hands. <br><br>  All of the above applies to the entire line of mice from <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/manufacturer-3dconnexion.html">3D Connexion</a> , but the <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/kupit-3d-gadjet/spacemouse-pro.html">SpaceMouse Pro</a> Wireless mouse is also wireless, which further enhances usability.  Tactile sensations do not lag behind visual ones - everything is at the level required for professional work. <br><br>  <b>Functional</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5d0/f83/790/5d0f8379095a4070b2820ae416f7a419.jpg"><br><br>  This <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/kupit-3d-gadjet/3d-mouse/">3D mouse</a> facilitates and speeds up work in 3D applications and helps with orientation in the application space.  It is provided with a 3Dconnexion Cap handle with six degrees of freedom. <br><br>  With its help, you can rotate and move an object or camera in all planes, without taking your fingers off the joystick.  It is supplemented with function keys that allow both changing the nature of the joystick operation and replacing the standard keys on the keyboard.  Due to this, the hand has to be transferred from the 3D mouse to the keyboard and back less often. <br><br>  The LCD screen, which is only present on the top model of the line, is capable of displaying hints about the functions of programmable keys, allows you to work with mail, Outlook, view the RSS feed, and this is only the default - it can be easily customized to fit your needs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b84/617/9d7/b846179d7b3d4be1b1082d4a6e019899.jpg"><br><br>  Like any professional tool, a <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/kupit-3d-gadjet/3d-mouse/">3D mouse</a> is addictive.  The manufacturer took care of this and included in the software package that came with the mouse, a small simulator, a speed test, and even a mini-game.  After going through all this, you can quite confidently use the mouse in the application you need. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/992/5da/38a/9925da38a97a4490a22eced1e0718673.gif"><br><br>  Initially, the use of the manipulator will be a little distracting and slow down, but in the process of habituation you begin to pay attention to the undeniable advantages of <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/kupit-3d-gadjet/spacepilot-pro.html">SpacePilot</a> - smooth movements, ease of button layout, comfortable arm position.  The usual operations, such as scaling and rotation, will require fewer mouse clicks and unnecessary movements, and over time, performance will increase compared with a bunch of mouse + keyboard.  The only question is the time it takes to train. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/006/d13/2f7/006d132f7dc64ea2a88e7a353d8bdb02.JPG"><br><br>  For example, consider the work with the manipulator in 3Ds Max 2013. After installing the drivers from the manufacturer's website, 3Ds Max recognized the mouse and immediately started working with it without any problems.  The response to the movement of the handle is excellent, even the slightest movement is recognized, however, there is also a comfortable dead zone.  The block of keys to the right of the handle allows you to quickly switch between views ‚Äî front, top, right, and isometric, as well as rotate clockwise or counterclockwise. <br><br>  The block of keys on the left contains key modifiers (Shift, Escape, Alt, Control), as well as function keys for quick access to the program's functions - cancellation, RMPro, animation playback, and so on.  You can assign up to 10 actions in total.  And in order not to get lost in them, prompts on the functions of a particular key of this block will be displayed on the device‚Äôs LCD screen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b9d/10c/6d5/b9d10c6d5d3b4f58aa1f228092112661.JPG"><br><br>  The functionality of <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/kupit-3d-gadjet/spacepilot-pro.html">SpacePilot Pro is</a> not limited to 3D applications alone.  It can be useful in everyday PC use, when working in Photoshop, Word, browsers, Google Earth and even some games are also declared. <br>  The list of compatible applications at the moment includes 3ds Max, Maya, SolidWorks, Blender, Cinema 4D, Autocad, SketchUp !, Photoshop and many others.  The full list is available on the <a href="http://www.3dconnexion.ru/supported-software/software0.html">manufacturer's</a> website. <br><br>  Among the drawbacks, I would like to mention only the easily soiled surfaces of the handle and the LCD screen panel, which both attract dust and fingerprints.  This also includes the price of the device: for the older model, prices start at $ 575.  However, younger models are slightly inferior to their older brother in functionality, and cost less: SpaceMouse Pro, which differs only in the lack of a screen, can be purchased for $ 403.  If you need only a 3D mouse without additional functions, you can also purchase it: SpaceNavigator is at your service for as low as $ 150. <br><br>  As for the rest, there are no complaints about the mouse: it performs the stated functions perfectly, is assembled qualitatively, from good materials. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion</b> <br><br>  <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/manufacturer-3dconnexion.html">3DConnexion has</a> provided a tool for real professionals.  Appearance and functionality fully justify its price, one has only to get used to it and start using all the features to the fullest.  Opportunities for him is even more than it seems at first.  It really can speed up and simplify work in 3D applications. <br><br> <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2b4/d35/8d4/2b4d358d4d8e410f9923b6ae22722b65.png"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/376707/">https://habr.com/ru/post/376707/</a></p>
