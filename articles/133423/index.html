  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Wow mobile from Ukrtelecom. Beware scammers!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Moving to Odessa, I needed mobile Internet.  Since the quality of ADSL Internet from Ukrtelecom (the largest Internet provider in Ukraine, the number of subscribers is 1260,500) for 2 years satisfied me, I decided to connect to their service - Wow mobile, with tariff conditions 10gig per month for 120 UAH.  When connecting, it was necessary to put it on the account of 200 UAH. <br><br>  Less than a month, as one morning the message came that the money ran out.  According to statistics in the program that comes with the modem, I used only 4.7 gig.  Therefore, I went to Ukrtelecom.  And here the most interesting begins. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  According to the statistics that they have, it turns out that I used all my 10 GB and additional megabytes at a price of 6 kop per megabyte (1 GB = 60 UAH).  Together 11.3 gig. <br><br>  Together with the modem there is a program with which you can connect to the Internet, see statistics, replenish your account. <br>  To my arguments that, according to statistics, only 4.7 gig was used, they said that it was not <b>accurate</b> , but it was necessary to click on the USSD icon and check there.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/d51b27d7/3f4964cb/c9ae19e8/c5430036.png"><br><br>  The question immediately arises, why is the statistics here if it is not accurate? <br>  And what does not mean exactly?  Is it 10, 100 megabytes of difference? <br>  If you calculate that 10gig cost 120 UAH, and the following megabytes are 6 kopecks, the total is 11.3gig <br>  The difference was more than 6yr! <br><br>  Because of the incorrect statistics values, I downloaded the audio books, as it was already the end of the month, and unused megabytes disappeared from the beginning of December and so I spent all the money for Ukrtelecom errors. <br><br>  After returning home, I checked the second way to determine how much money is in the account and the number of megabytes.  The results can be seen below. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/aad4cf6e/a7f26278/8ea5e6dd/7ae32b7f.png"><br><br>  On the panel about which the worker of Ukrtelecom talked for so long, you can find out only the state of the account, but you cannot see the number of megabytes spent.  And who on the account will determine the amount of traffic, if the statistics tab has detailed numbers? <br><br>  I was offered to write a letter to Kiev in their main office or buy an additional 5G for 60 UAH. <br>  The last sentence was especially cynical after I lured out 80 UAH. <br><br>  Perhaps it was an accident?  But in such cases, they apologize and correct the error as quickly as possible. <br>  And then pointed to the "inaccurate statistics."  To my direct question, did the girl answer in the affirmative? <br><br>  It is also not so easy to disconnect from them.  The girl from Ukrtelecom warned that there would be penalties.  The system is designed so that Ukrtelecom will still get into your pocket. <br><br>  I did not write to Kiev, it is clear that this is not a mistake, but a debugged system. <br>  I think the best solution would be to connect to another provider. <br><br>  <b>UPDATE</b> <b><br></b>  <b>The comments rightly said that the technical capabilities can not accurately count traffic.</b> <b><br><br></b>  <b>And my indignation is because instead of returning 6 gigabytes of traffic, which costs nothing for Ukrtelecom, they say that if you don‚Äôt like something you can turn off, but there will be penalties.</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Somehow it's not human.</b> <b><br><br></b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/133423/">https://habr.com/ru/post/133423/</a></p>
