      This is the third one, about what ours and colleagues have, sometimes the mamkins of borshchehleba, the local host administrators, and (sometimes worse) lovers of smoothies. <br>  As one mustache said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs wrong to pose a question.‚Äù  Both are worse, both the first and second biases. <br>  That's about both worse and will be the text. <br><br>  <b>Tl / dr.</b>  There will be many letters, unproved assumptions, unfounded theories and a whole stream of consciousness.  There will be a lot of digressions and it is not clear why the necessary bibliography by the end. <br>  Thermal effects and risk of damage to furniture are possible. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/aed/866/109/aed866109792bf14f8e997965f49b912.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Of course, it was possible to start the text from this video, <a href="https://youtu.be/0UuVy9tq1AQ">Interview with the Millennial</a> , it shows well the depth of our depths. <br><br>  <b>ATTENTION!</b>  <b>In this text, it is considered that the future is adequate for the authorities at all levels (which is not always the case from the candidate‚Äôs point of view) and knows what he wants (although often this ‚Äúwhat he wants‚Äù cannot be directly voiced).</b> <br>  This is not always directly the case. <br>  The leadership of the entire organization wants to "work", and to know how much it will cost "worked" and "how much it will cost did not work."  There are many books on this topic from a business point of view, and many terms, starting with TCO and <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2598%25D0%25A2-%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA">NIST SP 800-30 / NIST FIPS 200</a> . <br><br>  The management of a department (sector, group, direction, underline) may want something else, for example, to get a higher rating on the board of directors, and if this requires someone to suffer from a neighboring department, then there can be anything. <br>  The reverse is also true, and you can suffer. <br>  Linear management may simply not be in the mood of "today", or wants to immediately show the new employee where his place is and who he is. <br>  <b>Fresh example:</b> <br>  Went candidate for an interview.  They ask him why we need networks, websites and this is all in Active Directory.  He is smart, gives out <br>  1) for logical division of networks <br>  2) To manage replication traffic <br>  3) For applications that focus on this (DFS, Exchange, SCCM, and so on) <br>  4) And other options, such as the cost in the Exchange and the SharePoint hub site, you can also enter 5 and 6. <br>  He gets the answer NO !!!  from the master.  Slaps eyes, asks for clarification, he is answered: <br>  Have you, boy, heard something about life in KCC? <br>  To which the candidate answered, but?  This was voiced by the second paragraph. <br>  That is, the pathos interviewer did not hear him, because the KCC was not uttered.  Here is such a cool epic "about KCC" <br><br>  * KCC is a <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/242780/how-to-disable-the-knowledge-consistency-checker-from-automatically-cr">Knowledge Consistency Checker service</a> . <br><br>  <b>The problems that the future employer himself is comfortable with can be grouped in different ways.</b> <br>  The first grouping method is a list of obstacles in the path from the right employee to the right people. <br>  Here the following problems arise and are constantly present: <br>  1.1.  Inadequate vacancy wording. <br>  Corollary: the necessary frames simply do not go. <br>  Example: we are looking for a devops with knowledge of Waterfall and NSX, the task is printer maintenance. <br><br>  1.2.  Inadequate requirements for work and pay by the employer. <br>  Corollary: the necessary frames simply do not go. <br>  Example - <a href="https://habr.com/post/424875/">Why didn‚Äôt they call me back -2, or where applicants disappear</a> <br><br>  1.3.  Inadequate selection by HR. <br>  Consequence: the necessary personnel do not reach the technical interview. <br>  Examples - there are in sufficient quantities, unfortunately. <br>  Contrary to all too often (estimated - in a third of cases among HR), a common opinion about autism spectrum disorders in IT people "as a whole", and the fact that they "are somehow incomprehensible and speak Russian, but unfamiliar words must be simpler ‚Äù- <s>Schi simpler, sing louder!</s>  so, in my personal opinion, the average IT person is no more sick with a head than the average person ‚Äúin general‚Äù *. <br>  For the simple reason that IT today (and always) in the ordinary and middle positions is always about working with people, both in your team and in neighboring ones, and only somewhere far away from the team this is possible. <br>  * But this applies only to diseases within the framework of ICD-10, ICD-10.  The nature of the character, or, in the words of scientists, ‚Äúpersonality accentuation‚Äù in IT, on the average, may well be that it is slightly shifted.  Of course, no one collected statistics. <br><br>  Unfamiliar words that candidates ask HR may include both really incomprehensible or unknown HR things (technology stack, whose equipment, what services), and sometimes unfamiliar not only HR, but also their leadership - TC, Labor Code, payment processing, NDA, study leave, white salary, travel to all sorts of <s>booze</s> Dell / Red Hat / VMware / Veeam / MS / other forums instead of work, help 2-NDFL, on-call, and so on. <br><br>  <b>The second method of grouping is problems with the incoming cadres themselves.</b> <br>  Suppose a certain frame in HR opinion has two legs, two hands, a certain number of eyes greater than or equal to two, and in the summary he has written keywords for selection. <br>  Further selection, technical and personal interview begins.  It: <br>  - assessment of a person's ability to work with an existing leader, <br>  - assessment of a person by ability in an existing team, <br>  - assessment of a person by the ability to work according to the existing pattern of work, formal and informal, <br>  - assessment of the person on the ability to work with the current related departments, <br>  - assessment of a person by the ability to perform the tasks necessary for the business in the necessary time for the business, <br>  - assessment of a person by the ability not to break everything at once, or at least quickly fix, <br>  - Assessment of a person by the ability to arrange a small business based on the ownership of the enterprise.  Everything is included in this item - from the installation of the miner to the <i>underloaded domain controller</i> , to simply purchasing from the right people a bit more expensive.  The banal theft is also included here - as our ancestors in the USSR have bequeathed to us - carry every nail from work (as an option - Leaving the airfield). <br><br>  It is easy to see that the problems in this case are not only and not so much with the technical part as such, but with personal qualities and risk assessments from the unintended (or worse, premeditated) actions of this candidate.  There are a lot of stories about how a firing employee left his ruins to his colleagues, or a bomb in one form or another, or simply deleted all the developments, his and others'. <br>  The continuation of such stories is of two kinds. <br>  The first one, which is more common in fantasies, is that the employee is offered a plump envelope for repairing everything backwards. <br>  The second, much more real, is that an employee in snot fixes everything and promises never to do so again.  At best, for an employee - in the presence of police officers.  At worst - without them, and in the presence of the deputy head of the local (regional) PSEs. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/296/aa8/415/296aa84159b24d67aae525915368c3f6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The third, also met - that administrators laugh with the whole department, retrieve deleted data from backup, and work on. <br>  However, this is more about the organization of the division of labor, offline data storage and the worked out recovery scheme. <br><br>  <b>Let's return to the topic.</b>  <b>The standard situation looks like this:</b> <br>  Here is a candidate sitting, we have half an hour to assess whether he meets the requirements of "now" and "then." <br>  The price of a mistake is quite high - the first month (and it‚Äôs good if the first one) still does not work in full force, but will receive its salary, and the state, respectively, will receive its 30% in the unified social tax and 13% in the personal income tax . <br>  To this we must add indirect costs, namely, the expenditure of working time of the training employee - the one who will show and tell what and how, instead of his work.  The topic of employee input is well described by DeMarko in one of the heads of the deadline, but who read him? <br><br>  <b>What will we evaluate?</b> <br>  According to the list above, it is clear that it is necessary to evaluate three points: <br>  - Technical skills.  The opinion of the candidate and the reality. <br>  - Social skills for communication within the team.  Simply put, is it not an asshole? <br>  - SUDDENLY such a social thing as political views as part of social.  Oh, it's all bad. <br><br>  <b>Technical skills.</b>  <b>The opinion of the candidate and the reality.</b> <br>  With the assessment of the second (reality), everything is simple.  There are a number of simple questions, the answer to which the candidate <u>must</u> know.  There are questions for each field of activity, and the easiest to assess is to take these questions from the open part of what is on Pearson VUE, or from preparing for them.  Pearson VUE can be replaced with Prometric, Red Hat *, and other publicly available. <br>  Personally, I really like the test - what happens after you type google.com in the address bar and press Enter.  Such a story will show a lot.  Answers can be google. <br>  However, knowledgeable people suggested to me another good question - which resource * do you regularly read <a href="https://habr.com/post/412501/">and which blogger you know</a> ? <br>  * It would be necessary to mention here how such interviewers nodded knowingly if the candidate first of all calls the leading website on politics, astronautics and philosophy, where there are political repressions (no matter how they are called) and there is no table insertion button. <br><br>  * The situation with Pearson VUE, Prometric <i>or equivalent is as</i> follows. <br>  They alone are not good and not bad.  Yes, the questions there at the first stages (which can still be passed in the Russian Federation) are quite academic.  Nevertheless, the very fact of entering these exams already shows that the candidate is even striving for something. <br>  As for the Russian test centers (as an example - stepik), I don‚Äôt know anything about them, and didn‚Äôt collect statistics on them.  What a beautiful piece of paper gives out is.  Whether these papers are considered even in the Russian Federation - I don‚Äôt know now. <br><br>  <b>With the real situation with the first (the opinion of the candidate), everything is very bad, if we take the masses and statistics.</b> <br>  In the masses there are a number of stable beliefs, fueled by various kinds of irresponsible journalists ( <i>including experts in everything, starting from the fact that the party is mistaken in evaluating the expedition to the Sun *</i> ).  One of such stable beliefs is that in IT breads are sweet and easy, but you don‚Äôt need to know anything, you can search for the answer in Yandex.  It is in Yandex, not in Google, and look in Russian. <br>  In a pinch, you can write a question on the green conference or Russian technete, and you will surely help you quickly.  Unfortunately, it probably won't work with VMware. ** <br><br>  The result is a massive reassessment of the candidates' own knowledge. <br>  Underestimation happens much less frequently. <br><br>  <i>* After the Americans' flight to the moon, Brezhnev summoned Soviet cosmonauts to himself and orders them to fly into the sun.</i>  <i>On the order of the General Secretary, the astronauts say: ‚ÄúLeonid Ilyich is burning down, impossible.‚Äù</i>  <i>But Brezhnev is categorical: - What do you think, are the fools sitting in the Politburo, will fly at night ...</i> <br>  ** I‚Äôm not going to consider irresponsible sellers of access to or from (through and) information with the password "hello guys". <br><br>  <b>Social skills for communication within the team.</b>  <b>Simply put, is it not an asshole?</b> <br>  To my great regret, inflated self-conceit and the illusion of access to some secret knowledge, especially at a junior level, sometimes makes of a seemingly normal person ‚Äîit (through and). <br>  The problem again is that from a business point of view, such a tact (through and) is harmful, a person tries to become indispensable, and then blackmail the business through his indispensability, replacing his qualitative personal growth with entangling everything and everyone. <br>  Plus to this often, too often goes intolerance to the opinions of others and the inability to admit their mistakes and learn from them. <br>  Unfortunately, there is a bad tendency among the management - not to disassemble and prevent the repetition of mistakes, formalizing and automating the working procedures, but punishing them. <br>  Worse than this, only ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt say that to you‚Äù - when the leader makes a mistake and does not recognize it. <br><br>  The problem is that the level of muddachi difficult to determine immediately, besides, it can grow. <br>  Although there are probably methods - for example, ask the candidate to describe the mistakes of his two past leaders.  Or colleagues. <br><br>  <b>Political views as part of the social.</b>  <b>Even more likely political and economic views.</b> <br>  The question is perhaps the most difficult and ambiguous perceived.  Society in the Russian Federation is not just politicized, but very politicized.  Of course, still not at the level of the civil war of 1905-1907 or 1917-1923, and the situation is far from the repressions of 1932-1934 (this is not a mistake and not a substitute for 1937-1939, the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259D%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">Nazinskaya tragedy</a> is 1933). <br><br>  The problem is what. <br>  - When solving complex problems in IT, there is a problem of trust in a foreign opinion.  At the same time, no one guarantees that this opinion will be at least somewhat qualified.  As an example, the Gilev test, which has never been done in a documented virtualization environment (I tried it a couple of times, showed that 1c depends on the linear frequency of the core, this is news, but I didn‚Äôt have time to do it further), and shows the best price for firewood in the bay Tiksi, at worst - the obvious, the dependence of 1c on the linear frequency of the core, but in reality the fact that nobody mastered the test disk from 1C itself (me too). <br>  - When solving complex problems in IT, incoming information from neighbors can be either simply incomplete or in principle unreliable. <br>  - When solving complex problems there is a problem ... how to properly call it - masquerading.  When some symptoms are actually the result of something more complex (complex).  This is the factor of people who seek to push the problem away from themselves, instead of solving it, and the factor of the equipment, when it is necessary to go to a level below the operating system, and so on. <br><br>  At this stage, there is a certain similarity with the policy, where everyone lies, only in different ways, and trusting someone in politics means receiving risks of trust from Aunt Zina, who did not press anything, or to the development department, who immediately filled it with food, but it does not confess. <br><br>  Another side of the problem is organizational risks in the presence of an active citizenship, both couch and very active. <br>  Organizational risks here are both internal and external. <br>  Internal risks in the active sofa position - colleagues begin to consider each other as assholes who do not understand the obvious.  The interaction within the department suffers, the working time is worthlessly wasted, which is actually not paid for it.  And no one often can prove anything to each other, due to the different base of views. <br><br>  Level sracha - what color are cats, white or black, or are there cats (and not cats) tricolor. <br>  Not even, the level of assessment ‚Äúwell, can these wonderful people really perform as <a href="">DJ Alexander Serov in the best years</a> ‚Äù? <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c88/c7b/646/c88c7b646a0319cd64289c86f7a7d8bc.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  External risks are like mild risks of getting under the administration, the level ‚Äúwent for a walk and well, I accidentally fell under the distribution even 15 days‚Äù, and more severe when active citizenship directly leads to a criminal case of embezzlement, or something else something similar. <br><br>  <b>There would have to be some conclusion, but it will not.</b> <br>  Instead, there will be a list of references and surnames that would be nice to at least try to read to everyone related to IT, and this is not Mikhail Mikheev (Administering VMware vSphere 5) and not Wendell Odom (Official Cisco Guide for preparing for certification exams CCENT / CCNA ICND1 100 -105) <br>  The list here is needed at least so that someone can understand a little better how the world outside IT works and works.  Maybe someone will help a little bit, although most likely it will cause a srach "well, and why is it here." <br>  We must begin with Lance Taylor (Lance Jerome Taylor), but he is not in Russian. <br>  Therefore: <br>  1. Anikin.  Youth of science: Life and ideas of thinkers - economists before Marx. <br>  2. Old extremist Ford (listed as extremists) - My life, my achievements.  FULL edition, including three pages of his opinion about the USSR of the early 20s. <br>  3. Taylor.  Principles of Scientific Management <br>  4. Jared Diamond.  Guns, microbes and steel. <br>  5.

About DeMarco and Deadline I wrote above. <br><br>  ps Although not, the conclusion will still be, although I have already mentioned it in a non-existent (in one word) <a href="http://samlib.ru/editors/i/iwanow_iwan_iwanowitch/kukbuk2-2017-07finaledition.shtml">work</a> . <br>  The labor market is shrinking all over the world, in the Russian Federation a little faster, and at the same time, IT is constantly growing.  In order to successfully compete with them, and grow in career and money, you need to constantly run in all three directions at once - technical, social (interaction with people) and the general (output from the local market to the international one through FCE / IELTS / TOEFL understanding of the goals and objectives of the business).  One technical level, moreover, at the SMB level and further further - not enough now.  So read the books, they rulez. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/425539/">https://habr.com/ru/post/425539/</a></p>
