The company "Open Mobile Platform" (OMP) agreed to create smartphones on Sailfish Mobile OS RUS Russian production.  Until the end of this year, <a href="http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/3008908">three models will go on sale</a> : Jolla JP-1301, Oysters smartphone, as well as an industrial smartphone under the proud name "Ermak OMP", running the Sailfish Mobile OS RUS mobile operating system on the Linux kernel. <br><br>  ‚ÄúSailfish OS is completely independent of any states and players of large industries that build their closed ecosystems,‚Äù the operating system user manual says. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The fact of the release of the first smartphones on the Russian OS has become known from the official application for the inclusion of the mobile operating system Sailfish Mobile OS RUS into the registry of domestic software, which the Tatar OMP submitted to the Ministry of Communications and Mass Communications of the Russian Federation, Kommersant <a href="http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/3008908">reports</a> .

For example, in the first section describing the operating system it says: <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúSailfish OS is a modern mobile operating system.  It is completely independent of any states and players of large industries that build their closed ecosystems. ‚Äù </blockquote><br>  The word "independence" is repeated several times: "The Sailfish OS is an independent operating system that is not directly dependent on Android."  At the same time, it is emphasized that Sailfish OS is compatible with the Android ecosystem both at the application adaptation level and at the hardware adaptation level. <br><br>  The developers have inserted into the user manual screenshots of Sailfish in English, obviously, taken from the Finnish developer - the company Jolla. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/180/976/7ff/1809767ffa144d1799ca9c367c79de13.jpg"><br><br>  Negotiations with the Finnish company Jolla on the creation of a Russian operating system based on Sailfish (Linux kernel, the development of the Meego project) have been going on for several years.  In May 2015, at a meeting of representatives of the Ministry of Communications and Jolla, <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/290644/">it was announced</a> that Russia plans to create its own mobile operating system based on the original <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailfish_OS">Sailfish OS</a> . <br><br>  According to the results of that meeting, the Finnish rightholders <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/290740/">stated</a> that we are not talking about the creation of a Russian OS, and only some of the components of the operating system can be upgraded or replaced.  At the same time, the company welcomed the adaptation of the operating system by Russian specialists, that is, the Russification of the interface and other necessary details. <br><br>  Probably, over the past year, the Russification of the system has nevertheless been carried out, and now the Open Mobile Platform enterprise is trying to register ‚ÄúSailfish 2.0‚Äù as a ‚Äúprogram of Russian origin‚Äù.  As you know, this gives a number of bonuses, including priority in public procurement. <br><br>  Future users of Sailfish 2.0 will be pleased that this operating system is <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/193968/">fully compatible</a> with the Android ecosystem both at the application level and at the equipment level.  In other words, here you can install any Android-applications from the relevant application directories. <br><br>  The Finnish company Jolla was founded by former Nokia employees.  In addition to the Finnish and Chinese shareholders, the company‚Äôs shares are owned by Russian owners.  Among them are the head of the ESN group of companies, the candidate of chemical sciences, the Russian multi-millionaire <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2591%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D1%2591%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD,_%25D0%2593%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9_%25D0%2592%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587">Grigory Berezkin</a> (80% of the shares). <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe see our mission in making a mass product.  The Jolla C smartphone on Sailfish OS can already be bought in Europe, and its version on Sailfish Mobile OS RUS will go on sale until the end of the year.  Approximately at the same time, the Oysters smartphone will appear on the Russian version of Sailfish, now we are negotiating with the company regarding the required technical characteristics of the device, ‚Äùsaid OMP general director Pavel Eyges. <br><br>  European smartphone <a href="https://jolla.com/jollac/">Jolla S</a> running OS Sailfish 2.0 was introduced in May 2016.  It is equipped with a 4-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 212 processor with 2 GB of RAM and 16 GB of internal memory, a 5 '' screen and a 2500 mAh battery.  The price is ‚Ç¨ 169. <br><br>  Mobile computer " <a href="http://m-infogroup.ru/oborudovanie/mobilnye-pc/282-ermak-omp">Ermak OMP</a> " for corporate users is preparing to release the company Mobile Inform Group.  As <a href="http://m-infogroup.ru/o-kompanii/novosti/158-mobile-inform-group-anonsiruet-vypusk-promyshlennogo-smartfona-ermak-50">stated on the official website</a> , it will work on a 2-core Qualcomm Snapdragon MSM 8960 processor with 1 GB of RAM and 8 GB of internal memory, a battery capacity of 3450 mAh, and a 4.5 ‚Äùdisplay.  ‚ÄúThe device will work with all types of radio frequency tags, bar codes and data transmission over open and encrypted communication channels.  The smartphone is built specifically for intensive long-term operation. " <br><br><blockquote>  The device is equipped with a communication package supporting 3G / 4G LTE cellular communication standards on 2 SIM cards and GPS / GLONASS modules.  The device has a solid level of physical protection and is built specifically for intensive long-term operation: dustproof, waterproof IP65, mechanical stability - repeated falls on concrete from a height of 1.5 meters, operation at temperatures from -20¬∫ to + 60¬∫, work up to 10 hours without recharging (at -20 ¬∫). <br><br>  Depending on the configuration, the Ermak OMP protected smartphone is equipped with an internal RFID module for working with different ranges of tags and contactless cards: LF, HF, UHF.  Optionally equipped with a fingerprint scanner, machine-readable zone reader (MRZ). </blockquote><br>  Production of the Ermak OMP smartphone will be launched in the territory of the Russian Federation. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe understand that we are entering a fully occupied market, which is dominated by two operating systems, but we believe that there are unoccupied niches,‚Äù said Pavel Eyges, general director of the OMP. <br><br>  There are definitely unoccupied niches.  According to a <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/276618/">draft resolution of the</a> Ministry of Industry and Trade published two weeks ago, state-owned companies and companies with state participation do not have the right to purchase foreign-made radio electronics for state and municipal needs if they have a Russian equivalent.  The banned list includes imported communications, laptops, tablets, <b>smartphones</b> , computers, storage devices, diodes, integrated circuits, e-books, etc.  It is possible that the Ermak OMP smartphone will be recognized as a ‚ÄúRussian smartphone‚Äù and will be added to the appropriate register of communication equipment as a product of Russian origin.  In this case, it will begin to buy government structures in batches of millions of copies. <br><br>  In this niche there is an opportunity to earn a little.  The client manager told the Kommersant newspaper that the price of the Ermak OMP smartphone, depending on the configuration, would be $ 1,500‚Äì2,000 (from one and a half to two thousand dollars). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/394899/">https://habr.com/ru/post/394899/</a></p>
