And about what the monopoly in the field of providing Internet communication services leads to. <br><br>  * abbreviations used: Yuteka = UTK (I do not want too much PR for this shit). <br><br><h1>  So what we have. </h1>  The largest, I would even say - exclusive, communication service provider (telephone, dialup / dsl Internet, ip-telephony, etc.) Southern Telecommunications Company (Southern Telecommunication Company), providing services in the following regions / territories / regions: Adygea, Astrakhan , Volgograd, Kabardino-Balkaria, Kalmykia, <br>  Karachay-Cherkessia, Krasnodar Territory, Rostov Region, North Ossetia, Stavropol Territory.  That is, almost the entire Southern Federal District.  Immediately make a reservation that I will write for the most part about the Krasnodar Territory, because  I live here myself and am familiar with the situation on my own hard experience :)

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  Tariffs. </h1>  This company provides ‚Äúhigh-speed Internet access using ADSL, ADSL 2+ technology.‚Äù Called <a href="http://www.diselcom.ru/whatsdisel">DISEL</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/0d5/f15/fcf/0d5f15fcf97aaacbcc0d1700b3330d6b.jpg" width="450" height="87" alt="Internet Diesel" hspace="10" vspace="10">  In principle, it is already possible to laugh from the name - as you know, all kinds of tractors work on a diesel engine: <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/70e/3c2/c0d/70e3c2c0d97436c05d65a4b1277ce353.jpg" width="211" height="140" alt="Diesel tractor" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br>  Further, I invite you to familiarize yourself with the tariffs, and this will be the beginning of an exciting journey into the world of dolby * Internet services in the Krasnodar Territory.  So, <a href="http://www.diselcom.ru/krasnodar/tarifs">tariffs</a> , I will give a couple of examples here: <br><br>  <b><font color="#000000">Providing access to the Internet using xDSL technology</font></b> <br><br>  Providing access to the Internet using xDSL technology with provider's terminal equipment 1950.00 <br><br>  Providing xDSL Internet access with client terminal equipment 950.00 <br><br>  (this is just connect yet) <br><br>  <b><font color="#000000">Tariff Plan ¬´DISEL-Unlim¬ª</font></b> <br>  Monthly subscription fee for the provision of Internet access services using ADSL, ADSL 2+ technology at speeds up to 64 Kbps 650.00 <br><br>  Monthly subscription fee for the provision of Internet access services using ADSL, ADSL 2+ technology at speeds up to 128 Kbps 1000.00 <br><br>  Monthly subscription fee for the provision of Internet access services using ADSL, ADSL 2+ technology at speeds up to 256 Kbps 1500.00 <br><br>  Monthly subscription fee for the provision of Internet access services using ADSL, ADSL 2+ technology at speeds up to 512 Kbps 2900.00 <br><br>  Have you stopped laughing?  That's the same :) <br>  I will explain about the mark # Access to the resources of the portal Mediazona.ru is carried out without speed limits.  - Mediason is a local resource for the STC network, access to which occurs without speed limitation, i.e.  as stated in the contract - up to 8 Mb / s, which is often used for any excuses in style - and we promised you a speed of up to 8 Mbps mol.  In fact, megabit does not happen lately, but this is a separate discussion already. <br><br><h1>  Connection </h1>  To connect, you can even drive a phone into the form on the website on the right, but something inside of me, as well as some reviews, suggests that all this is just pont.  In fact, you need to go to the office, enter into an agreement, pay and wait.  And you have to wait ... ha!  There are no fixed dates.  Some waited for 3 months while they were hooked up, they say, they don‚Äôt have any free ports (and this is the monopolist company fighting such SUCH prices for the Internet! There‚Äôs nothing for the poor to buy equipment), and at the same time other people were connected to which ports why were.  As a result, the process of waiting for the connection is reduced to a constant ringing of their office and constant dripping on their brains - and for some reason this really speeds up the process, even in the absence of ports. (David Blaine helps?) <br><br><h1>  Quality of service. </h1>  With one figured out, even connected, maybe even managed to configure the modem and go online.  And now about the quality of services. <br>  Quality is disgusting.  That is, the Internet certainly works, yes.  But at one point, he may well fall into two weeks.  This situation was last summer in July when " <a href="http://www.yuga.ru/news/100424/">foreign hackers for DDOS or STC</a> ."  That is, they put nafig on the shoulder blades of such a large provider.  Here you can read about it on the forum media zones <a href="http://mediazona.ru/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D22251%26hl%3DDDOS">here</a> and <a href="http://mediazona.ru/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D22125%26hl%3DDDOS">this</a> , you can also laugh.  And we were not very funny when access to the outside world in general was almost cut off, ICQ did not even work.  Then, by the way, many organizations suffered losses because of this, since  they were also served by UTK :) In general, there was a lot of mate, but it was hushed up somehow. <br><br>  Well, it often happens that the dsl signal disappears in some unknown way, then your username and password do not match.  Once they still had a feature that, one fine day, statistics appeared from somewhere around 180 megabytes of external traffic (i.e., 300 with something rubles of money) - from where, xs.  Even if the person was not online at this time - to explain from where, what - they could not. <br><br>  In general, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worthwhile to detail all the flaws in me ‚Äî for me, users have already done this thousands of times.  You can <a href="http://mediazona.ru/forum/index.php%3Fshowforum%3D58">read here</a> (discussion of the work of a diesel engine).  Especially it is worth paying attention to the almost complete lack of adequate responses from the administration of the portal (about them separately) <br><br>  Already probably about a year, we, the users, are being fed with promises of expanding the channel, so that it will pump normally, at least from local resources.  Instead, we constantly get sophisticated bullying from the portal administration (STC contractor for its development Spider Group is terrible people, or the management of STC influences them so much. I'll write about bullying later a little :) I don‚Äôt give them a link, because  I do not want to promote :)) <br><br><h1>  Bottom line: expensive and crappy internet without the possibility of choice. </h1>  At the end of the first part, which I decided to do separately about UTK and the quality of their services (technical), I want to say that the <a href="http://2ip.ru/iprov/rating.php%3Forder%3Dbad">South Telecommunications Company is at 1 (first) place in the rating of the worst providers in Russia</a> , with a margin of 2 (VolgaTelecom) in 2 ( twice.  You <a href="http://2ip.ru/iprov/view.php">can read</a> reviews about them if you choose UTK provider at the top.  Solid negative. <br><br>  The most stupid thing is that this company, a huge awkward legacy of a scoop - does not even think about losing customers, here it is a monopoly.  They really don't care about the quality of services, they never hear users.  I will not be able to list on the fingers of even one hand my familiar friends who are satisfied with the Internet from UTK.  Technical support is a continuous [beep] [beep] [beep] [beep] [beep].  I will not even begin to paint, everything can be read on the forum media zones.  In huge quantities. <br><br>  There are literally no alternative providers.  Corbin came to the territory of the Rostov region, and of course some went to her, but since  big city - not everyone has the opportunity to go to it.  The same is with Krasnodar, there are some alternative providers that put prices lower than UTK, for example <a href="http://za650.ru/tariffs">Kubtelecom</a> , but also the problem is that it is not available everywhere else.  There is even no talk of smaller cities, there is NO choice here, all that remains is to endure these [bleep] antics or go to the satellite, but not everyone has the money for it, and not everyone wants to get involved with it. <br><br>  Moreover, this [bleep] company is not really and itches to at least reduce prices on the Internet.  In the modern world, providers constantly reduce prices while improving the quality of services (for example, a person had anlim 512 kbit / s for 500 rubles, and another megabit for 1000 had 2 megabits introduced - the one who was 512 switched to meg, two). <br>  Everything is wrong with us.  For their three years, Diesel and Yuteka have prepared a <a href="http://www.diselcom.ru/news/2008-05-30%3Fid_item%3D188">mocking gift to all their users</a> - read on the link.  New fares at more expensive prices.  No reduction in prices for old ones (only in 8 major cities of the Rostov region).  Internet 512 kbps for 2900 rubles - this is not pi * dec they have gone too far ?!  Well, to say that the quality has improved ... stupid. <br><br>  For some reason, the Federal Anti-Monopoly Service either does not see this or actively closes its eyes to this.  But this is a real monopoly on communication services.  Probably only the Consumer Protection Board solves some private issues related to this.  But in general, there is no progress in improving the situation.  But the letters to the FAS were repeatedly written by users.  And how not to notice, for sure the Internet for the Krasnodar FAS is provided by the same Yutek ... <br><br>  In general ... then I will finish the first part, and in the second I would like to tell you about the bullying of administrators of media zones over us, poor users ... <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> <a href="http://itech.ru/index.php%3Fpage%3D1%26articleid%3D128">that's</a> what they do with the only provider in my city <br><br>  PS all prices are in rubles ... <br>  PPS between the time of writing and publication (2 hours) the Internet fell once, I had to call their support.  They said that my session was hanging up and I needed to turn off the modem and wait half an hour.  I started to paranoid :) <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/28103/">https://habr.com/ru/post/28103/</a></p>
