  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Forget about your editor. Use Vim</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Enjoy the text editing process. <br><br><h2>  Introduction </h2><br>  Hello, dear reader!  This article is neither a manual nor a textbook.  In this article I just want to tell you that there is a more effective tool for working with text files.  With this article, I want to inspire you to, having exacted the deep-rooted habits in you, you tried a completely different, unlike any other, method of working with text. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Here I will manage without the history of Vim.  Let me just say that the main developer of this wonderful editor is Bram Moolenaar, and he originated from the standard Unix editor - Vi, authored by Bill Joy. <br><br>  Vi was created back in 1976.  At the same time, its unusual interface was invented, based on the division of operating modes into: normal, insert mode and command line mode.  Let many argue that such an approach arose only due to the limitations of the techniques of those times, but I argue that this method of work is more effective than anything other editors offer us.

      Vim demonstrates true power when working with texts that have some structure, i.e.  It is indispensable for programmers and web designers, but many of its features will greatly help when working with simple text. <br><br>  I also assume that you know how to, or learn to type blindly, and have no doubt that this skill is extremely useful.  If you have doubts about this, then I suggest reading a small digression. <br><br><h2>  Type blindly! </h2><br>  Why is it just necessary to type blindly? <br><br>  Remember how you learned to ride a bike!  At first you suffered, trying to understand how others do it, you could not drive even two meters.  But you tried!  You tried again and again.  Maybe an hour, a day or even a few days.  Not yet felt. <br><br>  Remember how pleasant that feeling was when you first felt what to do and that you became like one with the bicycle?  And then you quickly got used to it and forgot what happens otherwise ... <br><br>  If you do not remember how you learned to ride a bike, remember how you learned to swim or skate, remember any of your skills! <br><br>  So if you have to use a computer, enjoy communicating with the keyboard, instead of constantly feeling this terrible 100-button barrier (with a two-button button in addition) between you and the computer (and those with whom you communicate through the computer). <br><br>  Type thoughts, not letters and words! <br><br><h2>  Vim - edit blindly! </h2><br>  The same glorious feeling about which I spoke above appears in Vim too. <br><br>  If you are just typing blindly, you are happy to <b>enter</b> text without thinking about the process. <br><br>  Having mastered Vim, you <b>blindly</b> start <b>editing the</b> text: <br><ul><li>  quickly, without any scroll bars, move through the document structure, </li><li>  also quickly switch between multiple open documents </li><li>  it is easy to manipulate any blocks of text: words, sentences, blocks of code, </li><li>  (the list can be continued for a very long time - see the materials at the end of the article) </li><li>  <b>and even</b> write macros on the go for repetitive actions. </li></ul>  And all this blindly, without taking your hands off the keyboard, without using any interface elements and without using complex Alt, Ctrl, etc.  Instead, only using mostly easy-to-remember commands. <br><br>  The price of such pleasure is, as they say, a high barrier of entry, i.e.  difficult and slow period of development.  But this is the case when the only way to improve the quality of work is to invest time in training. <br><br><h2>  Are you ready to change? </h2><br>  So, if you are not afraid of difficulties in the way of mastering a completely different tool, if you are attracted by the prospects that I have talked about, I can offer you materials that you use to conquer this editor. <br><br><h3>  Tips for newbies: </h3><ul><li>  To exit the editor, enter <b>: q <i>‚ÄπEnter‚Ä∫</i></b> :), </li><li>  go <b>through the vimtutor</b> (: help vimtutor), </li><li>  read the <a title="A wonderful article from the very creator of Vim &amp; mdash; Brama Molenara." href="http://www.moolenaar.net/habits_ru.html">Seven habits of effective text editing</a> , </li><li>  Use the built-in help system <b>: help</b> . </li></ul><br><h3>  Materials for further study </h3><ul><li>  read the whole <b>: help</b> whole, </li><li>  review <b>Best of Vim Tips</b> regularly: <a title="http://zzapper.co.uk/vimtips.html" href="http://zzapper.co.uk/vimtips.html">http://zzapper.co.uk/vimtips.html</a> </li><li>  use <b>google</b> . </li></ul><br><h3>  Other materials: </h3><ul><li>  <a href="http://www.vim.org/">www.vim.org</a> - the official website of Vim. </li><li>  <a title="Article about Vim on Wikipedia" href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/VIM">Article about Vim in Wikipedia.</a> </li><li>  <a title="Why &amp; mdash; Vim" href="http://wiki.linuxformat.ru/index.php/LXF78:%25D0%259F%25D0%25BE%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D1%2583_%25E2%2580%2593_Vim%253F">‚ÄúWhy - Vim‚Äù</a> is a great article for the Linux Format magazine. </li><li>  <a title="All About Vim" href="http://allaboutvim.blogspot.com/">All About Vim</a> is a good blog in Russian. </li><li>  <a title="A large collection of tips (tips &amp; tricks) in the form of a wiki." href="http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page">A large collection of tips (tips &amp; tricks) in the form of a wiki</a> (in English). </li><li>  <a title="7 Habits For Effective Text Editing 2.0" href="http://video.google.com/videoplay%3Fdocid%3D2538831956647446078">7 Habits For Effective Text Editing 2.0</a> - video from the "creator" (in English). </li></ul><br>  I wish you good luck in finding a new useful and enjoyable skill! <br><br>  PS I have an idea to translate some materials into Russian (including <br>  including continue the <a title="abandoned project" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ruvim/">abandoned project</a> on the translation of embedded documentation) and place it on a separate website.
