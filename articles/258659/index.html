Notifications just fly away, and you do not know what happens to them further.  In PushAll, I implemented a system for collecting data on notifications.  You will be able to make a mailing to your users in the channel, and then follow what happens to the notifications: <br><ul><li>  How many people received notification </li><li>  How many people opened the notification (clicked the link) </li><li>  How many people just removed the notification from the list </li></ul><br>  Everything works thanks to feedback about the actions performed on the device. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  What is the use? </h1><br>  I think many have already guessed, but I will describe.  Suppose you have several videos coming out on YouTube and a channel in PushAll with 1000 subscribers.  You will be able to assess whether the information reached your audience and in what amount, how many people switched to each video, and how much it was not interesting.  And most importantly - <b>you can compare these indicators and see them in dynamics</b> . <br><br>  In the future, this data can be obtained by an API request.  They will also be recorded with a time stamp.  That is, you can see the schedule: when users started receiving notifications, after what time they opened or closed them.  As a rule, if they are not interested in the content, they will immediately close it.  If the content is interesting to them, but now it‚Äôs not up to it - they can leave a ‚Äúhang‚Äù notification and open it later.  In case he is important to them now, they will click on him immediately.  Due to this, we get the second advantage of this approach - to <b>find out whether your notice</b> or information is ‚Äúrotten‚Äù in time or arrived at the wrong time (at night, at work, early in the morning).

      Also by defining the delivery of the notification, you can duplicate it to another source.  For example, if you use notifications for monitoring, you can send a notification in case of a problem by pushing, and 10 minutes after checking the delivery, if it was not delivered, you can duplicate it via SMS.  Or, for example, if this is some kind of blogging system, you can send a push, and if it did not reach or did not respond to it, send a copy to the post office.  As a result, messages will accurately reach, and the box will not be constantly clogged. <br><br>  These recommendations are not only given as competitive advantages of the selected service, but also as an example of the benefits of push notifications in your applications. <br><br><h1>  Unicast API </h1><br>  In the previous topic, I wrote that this function is implemented.  Few people use it yet, but it is very useful.  As described above - you can send notifications of private messages or replies to comments.  The API is quite simple: to send you need to know the user ID, which can be obtained via Callback. <br>  Everything is quite simple: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dfb/850/61d/dfb85061debc4d71b0f3d3cd153043a0"><br><br>  1. In the created channel in edit mode, enter the address at which we get the ID. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4cb/be3/58a/4cbbe358a1fb4373a5e17b0ad38b6d86"><br><br>  2. Copy the subscription link.  By this link, the user will immediately see your channel and will be able to subscribe to it in one click. <br><br>  3. Introduce the GET parameter pushalluserid into our script, now it is passed as ADDRESS? Pushalluserid = 1, i.e.  advanced options are not supported.  If necessary, I will define the link for the flexible addition of the parameter. <br><br>  It should also be borne in mind that the user may come through the catalog and not be aware of your site: when you subscribe, your site will open in a new tab and the user will be able to register with you.  In this case, it will be necessary to record the ID in the session in order to further bind the number to the user. <br><br>  Further sending becomes through cURL, an example for PHP: <br><br><pre><code class="php hljs">curl_setopt_array($ch = curl_init(), <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">array</span></span>( CURLOPT_URL =&gt; <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"https://pushall.ru/api.php"</span></span>, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS =&gt; <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">array</span></span>( <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"type"</span></span> =&gt; <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"unicast"</span></span>, <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"id"</span></span> =&gt; <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">" "</span></span>, <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"key"</span></span> =&gt; <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">" "</span></span>, <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"uid"</span></span> =&gt; <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"ID "</span></span> <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"text"</span></span> =&gt; <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">" "</span></span>, <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"title"</span></span> =&gt; <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">""</span></span> ), CURLOPT_SAFE_UPLOAD =&gt; <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">true</span></span>, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER =&gt; <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">true</span></span> )); $return=curl_exec($ch); <span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment">//    curl_close($ch);</span></span></code> </pre> <br>  There are also additional parameters suitable for all types of notifications: <br><ul><li>  url - add a link to push </li><li>  hidden - if equal to 1, then hide the push from the history after sending </li><li>  encode - encoding, for example cp1251, if utf8 is used - do not use </li></ul><br><br>  You can also see the user ID yourself in the list of subscribers.  And also manually send him a message. <br><br><h1>  Shahr </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/574/872/820/574872820e4247fea54851627d5016bd"><br><br>  Recently, we have been connected to <a href="https://pushall.ru/%3Ffs%3D129">DocHabr</a> , it provides a convenient interface for viewing articles on IT resources ‚ÄúHabrahabr‚Äù, ‚ÄúGiktayms‚Äù and ‚ÄúMegamind‚Äù - in one tape.  It provides a convenient interface for viewing articles on IT resources Habrakhabr, Hiktimes and Megamind - all in one tape.  And now, thanks to PushAll, it has support for push notifications. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f90/b42/d0d/f90b42d0df6f48e5ac4a0c393cacd42b"><br><br>  After subscribing to it, you‚Äôll have all the articles coming out (which is rather inconvenient).  There are filters to solve this problem.  The above is an example of articles from Shahr where you can enter the hubs you need in the filters, one per line, and receive notifications only for them.  Moreover, you can enter not only hubs, but also any words of the title of the article or a piece of text from the description - everything is taken into account.  This makes this bundle more flexible than simple hub notifications. <br><br>  In parallel with this, you can subscribe to notifications about the release of the voices of your favorite TV series and fasten monitoring of your services.  And all this through one application. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/258659/">https://habr.com/ru/post/258659/</a></p>
