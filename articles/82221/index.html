      I would like to state in an easy and accessible manner an algorithm that I read a long time ago in the book by E.Ya.  Geek " <a href="http://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/3979009/">Entertaining math games</a> ." <br>  (When writing the article, the algorithm was supplemented) <br>  The whole strategy will be described for the "Classic" sea battle <br>  (a field of 10x10 each player has one chetyrehtrubnik, two trekhbrubnika, three dvuhtrubnika and four one-pipers). <br>  Ships cannot bend. <br>  Ships cannot touch. <br>  The player makes 1 shot, if he misses, then the move goes to the opponent, <br>  if it hits, it still shoots before the first slip). <br><br>  Of course the success of the game, to some extent depends on luck.  You can randomly strike at enemy territory and destroy all of its ships without a miss. <br>  This strategy will not give you 100% victory, but will increase the probability of your victory to the maximum. <br>  We had a girl in the class, so she didn‚Äôt expose a single-tube ship to the last, but an honest strategy will be described here. <br><br>  The strategy consists of 2 parts. <br>  1) Proper placement of ships. <br>  2) Correct shooting at the enemy. <br><br>  <b>The correct placement of the ships.</b> <br><br>  This idea has already been mentioned in the above <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/games/80155/">article</a> , I will repeat it and sign it in detail for those who do not know. <br><br>  The essence of the idea to arrange the ships so as to reduce the likelihood of hitting them. <br>  The hardest thing is to get into the one-pipe; our task is to arrange the rest of the ships on the minimum area, in order to leave as much space as possible for one-pipe. <br>  This arrangement is the arrangement "at the edges" or "around the perimeter." <br>  Thus, when all the ‚Äúbig‚Äù ships are sunk, it will be very difficult to search for single-pipe ones. <br><br>  I will show by example: <br>  I tried to keep the color scheme, as in the above game. <br>  Yellow = ships <br>  Blue = Superstructure (a place around the ship where the adjacent ship cannot be located) <br>  Sea wave (cyan) = the remaining area for the arrangement of monotrans. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/18a9c8dc/fd7024b3/7de0df20/8482c10f.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/8ee2f174/880cd5c9/ef1fb3a2/3f1f9bcf.png"><br><br>  When writing an article, an arrangement was accidentally found, which was not in the considered in the book. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/4ed5dfce/66031731/5db9416d/03a73007.png"><br><br>  Layouts can also turn out to be mirror reflections both vertically and horizontally, as well as turning the field 90, 180, 270 degrees. <br>  The area remaining for the placement of 4 single-tube ships, it turns out 60 cells.  Consequently, the probability of hitting a one-pipe ship is 4 out of 60 or 6.67%.  With other arrangements, the probability of hitting is higher. <br><br>  Consider an arbitrary arrangement that was proposed by the program. <br>  (I removed the monotubes for the purity of the experiment). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/e5205c9b/3485cec8/16b6e022/d99ccaf8.png"><br>  33 cells for placement of 4 single-tube ships, it is almost 2 times smaller <br>  those.  my probability of winning was almost 2!  times higher (not taking into account the optimal shooting). <br><br>  <b>Correct shooting at the enemy</b> <br><br>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcorrect shooting is as follows. <br>  First you need to try to get into the largest ship (for the classics it‚Äôs 4 pipe), since  it is probabilistically easier to get into it than in a monotube. <br>  We divide the field into 4x4 areas (arbitrarily).  It should turn out 4 full squares and all that remains. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/599716b4/6821e50e/ad5fadc3/5c8e6981.png"><br><br>  To do this, there are 7 combinations that can also be expanded by means of mirror reflections and turns.  With such a space, it is impossible to inscribe a four-pipe in a 4x4 square. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/608dc65b/5e36f29d/7848b9a6/aab8882d.png"><br><br>  The whole field is shot through in any sequence, observing the combination. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/6c04f7fa/1e02a3f8/3ad25813/6af064d9.png"><br><br>  If we get into a ship, then we must finish it to the end. <br>  After the ship has been hit, a superstructure is drawn around it in a single cell, <br>  so there is no reason to not shoot. <br>  Further, when the 4th pipe has been sunk, we are looking for 3 pipe manufacturers, we are clearing sparingly fields so that it will not be possible to install the 3 pipe manufacturers. <br>  We divide the field into 3x3 squares.  We shoot so that it was impossible to put 3 pipe. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/dd7bad9a/dc89724f/ba23fe61/28caf6cc.png"><br><br>  And so on.  We reach the monotonous, then how lucky. <br><br>  Well, in principle, that's all. <br><br>  After everyone in the class knew this strategy, we moved on to the game ‚ÄúSea Battle‚Äù (4 single-columnists are on the 5x5 field). <br>  After that, the game began to be more psychological in nature (who repeats or does not repeat when placing) than the mathematical one. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion:</b> <br>  I propose to the author ( <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/michurin/" class="user_link">michurin</a> ) of the ‚ÄúSea battle with intellect‚Äù to adopt this strategy and use it in parts, depending on the set intellect level of the program. <br><br>  <b>PS</b> When writing this article, no ship of the Navy was hurt =). <br><br><br>  <b>PS2</b> My games with the program: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/3c75224c/dfa12809/87fa7fca/3b5ae847.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/bf3a73c6/e7263447/c57e9511/0e99b6e0.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/7e872341/a9a5d3d5/5f6d99b4/97d8bdfd.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/515b3047/9fc74eca/6123fd6c/cd6cb62c.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/6df69d8f/24b54e59/642ed1fd/7896268c.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/e82373fe/2c7f64f9/20e378dd/f69b21be.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/349a0a50/81a0d455/16dbba01/4b8ed471.png"><br><br>  UPD Fixed pictures (transferred from pict.com to imagehack), but they are still not visible. <br>  UPD2 I put everything on habrastorage.org like everything is visible. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/82221/">https://habr.com/ru/post/82221/</a></p>
