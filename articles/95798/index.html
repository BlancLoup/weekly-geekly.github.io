About customs and shipments</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Much has been written about working with <a href="http://ebay.com/">Ebay</a> .  Often, Russian-speaking resources describe Russian realities and most of the writing is applicable to Ukraine, but there are nuances that should be noted. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Delivery. </h4><br>  It can be divided into three options: <br><ul><li>  delivery by regular mail.  <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%25BE%25D1%2587%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D1%2581%25D0%25BB%25D1%2583%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25A1%25D0%25A8%25D0%2590">USPS</a> , <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Post">An Post</a> , <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Mail">Royal mail</a> are all national postal services and their local partner will be <a href="http://www.ukrposhta.com/">Ukrposhta</a> .  There is an additional service to track the movement of parcels. </li><li>  delivery by express mail <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMS">EMS</a> - based on national mail, there is an international service represented in Ukraine by the <a href="http://www.emsukraine.com.ua/index2.php3">DPSA (special authority)</a> ; a distinctive feature is a slightly higher price, courier delivery and the ability to track the parcel by 13-digit number (as per outside Ukraine, and inside) </li><li>  International courier services ( <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/FedEx_Express">FedEx</a> , <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Parcel_Service">UPS</a> , <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNT_N.V.">TNT</a> , <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DHL_Express">DHL</a> ) in Ukraine have either representative offices or partner companies (for example, <a href="http://www.fedex.org.ua/">LLC Elin Ltd.</a> is a FedEx partner in Ukraine) - they also allow you to track package movements, courier delivery in Ukraine, mandatory declaration parcels and the provision of customs brokerage services (surcharge).  Expensive, but all-in-one. </li></ul><br>  What you should know about the delivery: <br>  Ukrposhta - the status of the parcel with tracking can be <a href="http://www.ukrposhta.com/www/upost.nsf/search_post%3Fopenpage">checked on the site</a> .  The information does not appear immediately, it takes some time while the parcel ‚Äúdisappeared‚Äù in, say, the USPS track and appeared in the Ukrposhta database.  You can also find out information on the number <b>0 800 500 440</b> (information support service).  As soon as the site reflects the information that the parcel is delayed at the sorting station in Kiev - the reason to call and check whether the parcel has fallen into the field of view of customs <br>  DPSZ (EMS Ukraine) - <a href="http://www.emsukraine.com.ua/index2.php3%3Fname%3DBase.html">on the site you can track the</a> movement of the parcel.  Again, the database does not get right away, but the status is updated more often than in Ukrposht.  You can also call <b>(+380) 44 235 33 81</b> and find out its current status by the number of the parcel. <br>  Logistics services usually call themselves to receive the parcel to Ukraine (because they need to get your consent to use the services of a broker and agree on the amount of the fee). <br><br><h4>  Customs clearance </h4><br>  The first and most important difference that any Ukrainian buyer has to assimilate is that in Ukraine the duty is charged on the ALL estimated value of the goods, and not on the excess of the estimated value over the non-taxable minimum.  Plus, for each parcel is charged VAT.  Total, to any parcel with a total cost exceeding the non-taxable minimum is added <b>44%</b> <br>  What you should know about customs clearance: <br>  The duty is charged for any product that crosses the Ukrainian border, the estimated cost of which exceeds the equivalent of <b>200 euros</b> (and weight in the range from 50 kg to 100 kg).  Special attention to the word "estimated", because  even if you have all the documents, the customs service is entitled to conduct its own assessment according to the classifier if they have doubts about the declared value.  <s>If there are several goods in the package and their <b>total cost exceeds 1000 euros</b> , then the duty is charged on all goods.</s> <br>  <s>The cost of the parcel is considered as the total cost of the goods and delivery.</s>  <s>That is, a telephone for 190 euros with a delivery for 15 euros has every chance to reasonably fall under the payment of duties and VAT</s> .  The cost of the parcel is considered as the total estimated value of the goods contained in the parcel.  Shipping cost is not counted.  The amount of duty, as well as the amount of VAT - 20% of the amount.  But they are only applied consistently, so P * 1.2 * 1.2 = 1.44 P - the difference from the expected price will be 44%. <br>  To challenge the estimated value of the post-factum I have never succeeded.  However, in the assessment process, customs officers can meet, if supporting documents are provided. <br>  Two important phones received in the course of persistent battles for reducing the duty: <br>  <b>+380 (44) 245-62-20</b> - the department of customs service dealing with international parcels EMS <br>  <b>+380 (44) 289-02-07</b> - the department of the customs service dealing with Ukrposhta parcels (USPS, An Post, etc. will get here) <br><br>  What not to do: <br>  Agree to offer labeling of the parcel as a gift.  This will not change anything in terms of the accrual of duties, but will certainly attract the attention of customs officers (‚Äúisn‚Äôt the price undervalued?‚Äù)

      If the seller puts in any document that looks like an invoice (invoice), then it will be extremely difficult to dispute the cost, since the document will be regarded unequivocally.  For example, a recently purchased used HTC HD2 was priced at double the cost, because the seller invested the Goods receipt (consignment note) of the times of his phone purchase to preserve the warranty.  As a result, the customs service calculated the size of the duty at the price of a new phone stated in the document, although this document did not have the slightest relation to invoice. <br>  Useful address: <br>  <a href="http://www.kmu.gov.ua/dmsu/">http://www.kmu.gov.ua/dmsu/</a> - the customs service of Ukraine.  Unfortunately, you can find reviews of many "poor fellows" who did not get acquainted with the rules of customs clearance in time.  Telephone numbers and addresses, unfortunately, are not always correct either; I was able to get to the above department phones from about the fifth call to the next number where I was ‚Äúplayed‚Äù. <br><br>  Successful to you rates and easy delivery! <br><br>  <b>Upd # 0</b> .  For those who do not like to call, Ukrposhta has a <a href="http://www.poshta.kiev.ua/forum.php%3Fact%3Dshth%26id%3D2%26fmsg%3D1170">forum</a> where qualified answers appear rather quickly. <br><br>  <b>Upd # 1</b> .  I did not find a norm in Ukrainian legislation that ‚Äúif the total estimated cost of several parcels to one address and / or for one recipient exceeds the equivalent of 1000 euros, then all parcels are subject to payment of a fee‚Äù.  Maybe someone can advise on this? <br><br>  <b>Upd # 2</b> .  Corrected the procedure for calculating the total value of the parcel.  Shipping cost is not included in the package price. <br><br>  <b>Upd # 3</b> .  A great addition sent by <b>L @ ‚Äã‚ÄãWyeR</b> (unfortunately, there is no invite for habr): <br><br>  <i>In general, they ask about personal transportation and about guitars instead of iPhones.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>So, it‚Äôs not even a matter of declaring or not declaring (the law provides for an oral declaration), but of whether to classify it as transported as a ‚Äúproduct‚Äù or as a ‚Äúpersonal thing‚Äù.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>See Articles 2, 3 and 4 of the Law:</i> <i><br></i>  <i><a href="http://zakon1.rada.gov.ua/cgi-bin/laws/main.cgi%3Fnreg%3D2681-14">zakon1.rada.gov.ua/cgi-bin/laws/main.cgi?nreg=2681-14</a></i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>All that you have described (and this is true for postal shipments) concerns goods.</i>  <i>And there are more personal items.</i>  <i>Personal belongings are declared orally or in writing and <b>are not taxed</b> .</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>The Cabinet has established a list of items related to personal belongings:</i> <i><br></i>  <i><a href="http://zakon1.rada.gov.ua/cgi-bin/laws/main.cgi%3Fnreg%3D1652-2001-%25EF">zakon1.rada.gov.ua/cgi-bin/laws/main.cgi?nreg=1652-2001-%EF</a></i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Other items to personal belongings can not be attributed - but in the list there are phones, laptops and so on.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>So, when I personally carry the phone across the border for personal use, this line of behavior is completely legitimate: ‚ÄúDuring my personal stay abroad, I purchased the phone for personal use and translate it across the border in accordance with Art.</i>  <i>2 of the Act.</i>  <i>This item is classified by the Cabinet of Ministers to the list of personal belongings.</i>  <i>In accordance with Art.</i>  <i>3 of the Law, I express a desire to declare in writing (this is if you need documentary evidence of the legality of customs clearance). ‚Äù</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>And all these 200 euros and 44% is already article 4, it concerns the <b>goods</b> .</i>  <i>Of course, if you carry a full bag of phones, they are classified as goods.</i>  <i>And if there is one, and still not plastered with factory films - then what could be the issues, personal thing, no taxes.</i>  <i>The presence or absence of films, of course, is not specified by law anywhere, just when the product is new and packaged as new, the customs officer may have reason to say that it is a product and you carry it for resale.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>For some reason, it just so happened that everyone was fixated on the norm on the transport of <b>goods</b> (article 4), and didn‚Äôt notice the norms on the transport of <b>personal belongings</b> (v. 2--3).</i>  <i>I believe that this needs to be corrected, people should be aware of their rights, and not only of their responsibilities.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>At the beginning of May, HTC Legend brought myself from Germany, without any problems, made it into the frequency surveillance, already in the white list.</i>  <i>No taxes, no fees, no taxes.</i>  <i>The main thing is to do everything right.</i>  <i>Law allows something!</i> <i><br></i> <br><br>  Thanks for the competent answer! <br><br>  Upd # 4.  <a href="https://habr.com/users/juriste/" class="user_link">juriste has</a> prepared an excellent <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/158909/">post with updates and clarifications as of 2012.</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/95798/">https://habr.com/ru/post/95798/</a></p>
