Thus, data from many sources are verified, such as the official websites of manufacturers, instructions on equipment, prices, technical characteristics, etc. By the way, the subject of the site that is being filled in today is the equipment for security systems. <br><br>  In order not to somehow fill the site, but to add quality, reliable and detailed information, I had to delve into all sorts of characteristics of surveillance cameras, lenses and other types of equipment that make up the security system. <br><br>  During my studies, I came across amazing paradoxes of our favorite Internet network, with which I want to share with inexperienced listeners. <a name="habracut"></a><br><ul><li>  So, we get acquainted, the first object is the <strong>black-and-white</strong> video surveillance camera MDC-4120C.  In the instructions downloaded from the official website of the manufacturer <br>  <a href="http://www.microdigital.ru/catalog/videocameras/black-and-white/mdc-4120c.aspx">MicroDigital</a> , written in black and white ‚ÄúBlack-and-white video camera‚Äú day-night ‚Äù, the characteristics indicate the video signal standard - PAL.

      For those who do not understand this, I will explain, firstly, black-and-white video cameras correspond to the CCIR or EIA signal standards, and color - PAL or NTSC.  Secondly, the day-night function corresponds to color video cameras.  This function allows the camera to automatically switch between black and white and color mode, depending on the light.  For example, at night, when the lighting is close to zero, the camera automatically switches to black and white. <br><br>  There are questions: so, after all, is it a black and white video camera and an error in the instruction about assigning the properties of a color video surveillance camera to it?  Or is it a color video camera and an error in the instructions where it says ‚Äúblack and white‚Äù?  In any case, inconsistency data in the instructions. <br><br>  Google also provides a black-and-white video camera with this article. <br><br>  After thinking about these options, I tend to think that the camera is black and white and it does not have a day-night function and the signal standard corresponds to CCIR. <br><br></li><li>  The following two points are devoted to writing various notation, abbreviations and phrases. <br><br>  There is a video compression format - <strong>MPEG-4</strong> .  Almost every time on different sites one can come across the consistent writing of MPEG4, and separate MPEG 4 and with a hyphen of MPEG-4.  Here I wondered how this abbreviation is actually spelled correctly. <br><br>  Perhaps, such behavior will seem to someone meticulous, but, I think, there will be those who understand the desire - to present the information correctly. <br><br>  Since I didn‚Äôt have much choice in clarifying the spelling of MPEG-4, I used two sources - <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPEG-4">Wikipedia</a> and the official website of the MPEG <a href="http://www.mpeg.org/">Motion Picture Expert Group</a> committee - a group of experts in the field of moving images.  Of course, Wikipedia, you can not trust 100%, after all - a free library.  But it‚Äôs a sin not to trust the creators of this format, if not among them, then there‚Äôs no place to look for the truth. <br><br>  According to the analysis presented to my opinion, it can be said that the data in both sources coincided, and the result was the writing of the abbreviation - MPEG-4. <br><br></li><li>  From the same level of correct spelling of words <strong>, video input, video output, audio input and audio output</strong> .  How are they written - together or separately? <br><br>  Here I was driven into a stupor not so much by my meticulousness, as by the surprise that appeared when I saw it on the same site, but only on different pages, writing words and <a href="http://pandacctv.ru/%3Fsection%3Dcatalogue%26catsec%3Dreg4%26product%3Dta420vga">merging</a> (in technical specifications), and <a href="http://pandacctv.ru/%3Fsection%3Dcatalogue%26catsec%3Dreg4%26product%3Dfonet">separate</a> <br>  (in technical specifications). <br><br>  The difference was that it was written together in the phrase - ‚Äúvideo input channel‚Äù, and separately simply in words - ‚Äúvideo inputs‚Äù, ‚Äúvideo outputs‚Äù, etc. So, if this word is used in the phrase, then its rule changes writing ?! <br><br>  By the way, Word normally refers to the continuous writing of the video input and video output, but here it‚Äôs categorically not suited to the consistent writing of the audio input and audio output. <br><br>  Personally, I trust the spelling dictionary more, in which next to the ‚Äúvideo ...‚Äù it is written: ‚Äúthe first part of difficult words is always written together.‚Äù <br><br></li><li>  Another interesting and disturbing moment was the indication in the instructions for one type of equipment of a different list of parameters. <br><br>  No, I understand, some special distinctive characteristics, but when one has an image format specified - color (black and white), and the other doesn‚Äôt specify any image at all in the characteristics ... The same simply cannot be logically. <br><br></li><li>  Returning to the instructions on the equipment, which are presented by various companies for download, you can capture and many more discrepancies. <br><br>  For example, I no longer pay attention, for the frequency of what is happening, that the technical parameters on the <a href="http://pandacctv.ru/%3Fsection%3Dcatalogue%26catsec%3Dreg4%26product%3Dta420vga">site are</a> presented alone (resolution, power source in the technical specifications), and in the <a href="">instructions</a> , which are also posted on this site, the values ‚Äã‚Äãof the parameters are different. <br><br>  I wonder what people are guided by when they fill the site ?! <br><br></li><li>  All kinds of discrepancies were captured by me, even in writing sizes.  When you need to write three parameters, for example, 33 x 44 x 66 mm.  What does each of them mean?  Are there any rules for writing sizes, in what order? <br><br>  My knowledge is more inclined to give due to the fact that the first should be the width, then the height, and then the depth.  But, as you understand, variations can be found different. <br><br>  To this question, unfortunately, I could not find an exact answer. <br><br></li></ul><br>  Maybe after reading you also had similar memories of various informational paradoxes ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/65480/">https://habr.com/ru/post/65480/</a></p>
