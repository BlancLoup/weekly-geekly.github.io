We summarized the 15 past meetings this year and chose the best innovative project 2010. More than 40 applications were submitted to the competition, but since the Saturday evening was not rubber, we conducted a preliminary examination of the projects and selected only the most worthy ones.  As a result, representatives of 14 projects and about 90 participants got through the snow and drifts to the Competition. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/859/a76/0ed/859a760edf4f03f463ea4540ef57c65e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  Quarter finals </h5><br>  To give the opportunity to present your project to the maximum number of people, we applied the Olympic system.  In the quarter-finals, representatives of six projects were given 150 seconds each to gain the sympathy of the expert council in the ElevatorPitch format, which this time was the most representative since the time of the Convention.  The experts included 3 professors, 4 doctors of science, 4 directors, 2 technical directors, 2 innovation managers, 2 TRIZ experts and 2 patent attorneys. <br><br>  The jury selected three projects from the quarter-finalists, which in the semifinal joined four more that were already selected.  Between the stages, Vadim Froimovich Kaner (patent attorney of the Russian Federation, TRIZ master) spoke on examples, explaining how important it is to protect his intellectual property in time.

    <h5>  Semi final </h5><br>  Among the semi-finalists, Sergei Anatolyevich Matvienko remembered, telling how GLONASS can be used to solve a specific and very important task of measuring the parameters of the gravitational field of the Earth.  At first glance, the formulation of the problem is puzzling, since we remember from school that g = 9.8.  However, it turns out that, depending on what is under our feet, gravity changes and this affects our well-being, for example, the work of the heart. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/180/d9f/bae/180d9fbae66f61a61062dbbfaf4e22f1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  The final </h5><br>  As a result, there were seven projects in the final. <br><ul><li>  Alexander Borovikov, <a href="http://club-inno.ru/member/projects/42-2/p7">SIMActivator</a> </li><li>  Andrei Zlatov, <a href="http://club-inno.ru/member/projects/42-3/p6">Fiber Optic Multiplexers</a> </li><li>  Mikhail Mamaev, <a href="http://club-inno.ru/member/projects/42-3/p3">Portable Cardiotelemetry System</a> </li><li>  Natalia Izvarina, <a href="http://club-inno.ru/member/projects/42-3/p5">Non-invasive antidepressant</a> </li><li>  Andrei Samokhvalov, <a href="http://club-inno.ru/member/projects/42-3/p1">Cleaning anilox rolls for printing</a> </li><li>  Alexander Katsay, <a href="http://club-inno.ru/member/projects/42-3/p4">Touch gas analyzer</a> </li><li>  Sergey Matvienko, <a href="http://club-inno.ru/member/projects/42-2/p2">Using GNSS to measure the gravitational field of the Earth</a> </li></ul><br>  The finalists were given 500 seconds to speak and the same for answering questions from viewers and members of the expert council.
