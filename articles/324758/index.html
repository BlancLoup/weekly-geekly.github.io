      So, about all this briefly and in order under the cut.  But brevity is not always useful, so, dear reader, there is one request.  If we were too brief, and you want to know about something in more detail - write in the comments! <br><br>  <i>Oh yes, in the article you will find a small gift to Habrahabr readers.</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  A brief introduction to the Orienteer </h2><br>  Orienteer is an open source platform for quickly creating business applications. <br><br>  Need something from the list below?  Or are you thinking about something specific to your business?  Are you a startup founder and need quick prototyping?  Then Orienteer may be useful to you. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e90/7e6/1c1/e907e61c16cb4176b75ccfcc6d6e5c89.png"><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Decryption</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  AMS - Association Management System <br>  ATS - Applicant Tracking System <br>  BPM - Business Process Management <br>  BaaS - Backend as a Service <br>  CMS - Content Management System <br>  CRM - Customer Relationship Management <br>  DW - Data Warehouse <br>  EAI - Enterprise Application Integration <br>  ERP - Enterprise Resource Planning <br>  IoT - Internet of Things <br>  LMS - Learning Management System <br>  MAP - Marketing Automation Platform <br>  PIM - Product information Management <br>  RAD - Rapid Application Development <br>  TMS - Training Management System <br></div></div><br>  The main feature of Orienteer is the balance between the configurability of the required functionality through the UI and through the code.  In most cases, the user interface is sufficient to do what you want.  But if something specific is needed, it can always be done through code: server or client (Angular JS, React, JQuery, etc.) <br><br><h2>  Architecture </h2><br><ul><li>  At the core of all is the multi-paradigm NoSQL <a href="http://orientdb.com/">OrientDB</a> database. </li><li>  Above, Google Guice is used for dependency management and flexible configuration.  Why Guice was chosen, and not the well-known Spring, is the topic of a separate article. </li><li>  And as a Web framework, Apache Wicket is used: a very powerful library that gives 100% flexibility with minimal system requirements. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/69b/fc1/a32/69bfc1a320b04feb8895456b1f1401aa.png"><br><br>  Read more in <a href="https://orienteer.gitbooks.io/orienteer/content/architecture.html">our documentation</a> . <br><br><h2>  Configuring the subject area </h2><br>  At the core of any information system is a certain subject area, and on top is a functional that allows you to work effectively with the objects of this subject area: create, manage, analyze, predict, etc. <br><br>  In most information systems, the subject area is embedded in the code, and its modification requires coding and database skills.  But for systems claiming BaaS or RAD this is unacceptable.  Orienteer has a built-in domain configurator, which immediately allows you to change all aspects of the underlying OrientDB database. <br><br>  The choice of OrientDB as a database helped us a lot.  The path to the choice of this multi-paradigm database was thorny and long: through MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and even attempts to write your own database.  About OrientDB I want to somehow tell in a separate article. <br>  The functionality of the configurator of the domain schema is fairly obvious: <br><br><ol><li>  Creating new classes with support for multiple inheritance. </li><li>  Creating attributes of classes of the desired type and setting the visualization method for them. </li><li>  Defining Class Relationships </li><li>  Setting validation rules. </li><li>  Setting up triggers and related business logic. </li><li>  Access control. </li></ol><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a92/20c/f28/a9220cf282034d4e8d90f61b58b2af9d.png"><br><br><h2>  Business Process Management: BPM </h2><br>  Orienteer would not be a platform for business applications if it were only able to conveniently store, search and analyze data.  We wanted him to help organize business processes for the relevant subject areas.  That is why the main task in the development of version 1.2 was integration with <a href="https://camunda.com/">Camunda</a> - an advanced open source business process management solution (in the figure below, the interface for working with Camunda via Orienteer). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2b7/46a/469/2b746a469f1b464f81ef94aa26923049.png"><br><br>  Camunda is built into Orienteer in such a way that the entire necessary subject area, the entire user interface is all done on Orienteer / OrientDB.  All you need to do is plug in the required <a href="https://github.com/OrienteerBAP/Orienteer/tree/master/orienteer-bpm">Orienteer-BPM</a> module. <br><br><h2>  Integration Management </h2><br>  For a long time, systems that are ‚Äúthemselves in themselves‚Äù and do not have integration with external systems have become extinct.  The world is becoming more complex, connections in it are becoming more cunning.  Therefore, the possibility of integration is an integral part of any business application platform. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/711/1a4/647/7111a4647008436c9b1c53e97f7022b1.png"><br><br>  As a basis for managing integrations, we took the well-proven <a href="http://camel.apache.org/">Apache Camel</a> framework.  Orienteer allows you to create configurations for Camel, launch and monitor integration sessions.  In the future, we plan to focus on the convenience of configuration, so that analysts do not have to learn the bird language XML and its use to configure Apache Camel. <br><br><h2>  Remote logging </h2><br>  Without application monitoring, it is very difficult to detect when something goes wrong somewhere.  The orienteer-logger module allows you to centrally monitor emerging problems, find correlations and manage incidents.  Analogue Google Developer Console or <a href="https://www.localytics.com/">Localytics</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ebf/914/c8c/ebf914c8c52f461d81b293778a3b74aa.png"><br><br>  By the way, our <a href="https://github.com/OrienteerBAP/orienteer-logger">client code for reporting incidents is</a> written in pure Java and can be used in any java-application, for example, under Android. <br><br><h2>  Data analysis, visualization and pivoting </h2><br>  Nowadays, no data analysis is possible anywhere, and we understand this perfectly.  The orienteer-pivot module allows you to quickly analyze and display data and, if necessary, save the created visualization as a graph or pivot table. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ece/246/33c/ece24633c95042f0bfcf37302a771118.png"><br><br>  Also since version 1.1 we have an HTML / JS widget, which, like the <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/">JSFiddle</a> , allows us to specify HTML, external libraries and JavaScript - for the visualization you need.  Access to the data itself is provided through the <a href="http_api.html">Orienteer</a> / <a href="http://orientdb.com/docs/2.1.x/OrientDB-REST.html">OrientDB</a> REST interface. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Visualization example</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7a7/d3b/202/7a7d3b20266e4fca831c3296a299b4cf.png"><br></div></div><br><h2>  Docker support </h2><br>  Docker is an amazing technology for delivering and deploying virtually any application.  You can always find a docker image for Orienteer deployment <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/orienteer/orienteer/">here</a> . <br><br>  To run Orienteer locally, just run the command: <br><br><pre><code class="bash hljs">docker run -p 8080:8080 orienteer/orienteer</code> </pre> <br>  Do you want, without installing a docker, to get your copy of the Orienteer in the cloud in seconds, but only for 4 hours?  :) <br><br><ol><li>  Open <a href="http://play-with-docker.com/">http://play-with-docker.com/</a> in a new window. </li><li>  Confirm that you are not a robot. </li><li>  In the left pane, click Add new instance. </li><li>  When the new instance rises, execute the command: <br><br><pre> <code class="bash hljs">docker run -p 80:8080 orienteer/orienteer</code> </pre> <br></li><li>  To the right of the IP address you will see a link to the launched Orienteer. </li></ol><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c58/b21/584/c58b215845784fd3aae0f40f208a2318.png"><br><br>  Want your Orienteer in the cloud forever?  Then this is a gift promised by us: <i>write in a personal, for what you would like to use Orienteer.</i>  <i>And if you are among the first 10, you will get it <b>for free</b> in our cloud.</i> <br><br>  <b>PS</b> Not only the Landmark itself supports Docker containerization, but also any derived application based on our maven archetype. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Generating a maven project based on Orienteer</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><pre> <code class="bash hljs">mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeGroupId=org.orienteer -DarchetypeArtifactId=orienteer-archetype-war -DarchetypeVersion=1.3-SNAPSHOT -DgroupId=com.mycompany -DartifactId=myproject -DarchetypeRepository=https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/ -DinteractiveMode=<span class="hljs-literal"><span class="hljs-literal">false</span></span></code> </pre></div></div><br><h2>  Data Access via Telegrams </h2><br>  The telegram grew out of just a messenger.  For many, this is already a source of news, information and good mood.  It has a lot of useful bots.  So we created a module for Orienteer, which, acting as a bot factory, allows you to organize user access to your data through Telegrams.  Try chatting with <a href="https://telegram.me/otelebot">@otelebot</a> : through it you get access to the IMDB movies database, which, by the way, were downloaded using our Orienteer module for Apache Camel. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Screenshot of the conversation with the bot</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/24a/7ac/ebd/24a7acebdd25443fb1878ce0d5e33425.png"><br></div></div><br><h2>  Plans for the next versions </h2><br>  The most interesting thing that will appear in version 1.3 is the ability to connect new modules (plug-ins for Orienteer) without recompiling and without restarting the application server at all.  This will allow adding modules as they are needed ‚Äúon the fly‚Äù: from small to very powerful (&gt; 50Mb). <br><br>  In version 1.3 <a href="https://github.com/OrienteerBAP/Orienteer/tree/master/orienteer-birt">we also</a> <a href="https://github.com/OrienteerBAP/orientdb-oda-birt">integrate</a> with the Eclipse BIRT (Business Intelligence Reporting Tool).  This will allow you to create beautiful reports in the BIRT editor, and then embed them as widgets on the desired pages of business applications. <br><br>  And with the last idea for 1.3, we need your help.  Web designers must have noticed that we use the boring SP Admin design for everyone.  We want to find our unique face.  If you are ready to work on an open source project, then welcome to PM. <br><br>  PS And if we talk about a more distant future, the plans are even more ambitious: <br><br><ol><li>  Orienteer SaaS is a platform for deploying sales of your docker-packaged application on your infrastructure or on the infrastructure of any cloud provider. </li><li>  Open Source Orienteer CRM - CRM, which uses the wide possibilities of the configuration of the subject area, to solve the important question for many: ‚ÄúShould a business be pulled over CRM or should it be CRM on business?‚Äù </li><li>  R language integration: for easier data analysis and visualization creation. </li><li>  You can create your own modules for Orienteer now, but we want to make the process even more simple and accessible to a wide range, including analysts.  We are also considering the possibility of migrating Odoo (and other BAP) modules to Orienteer. </li></ol></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/324758/">https://habr.com/ru/post/324758/</a></p>
