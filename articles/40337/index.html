      And the Internet is an ordinary thing, we say.  But how, HOW can you transfer your voice to the other side of the globe in a second? <br><br>  The twenty first century is the century of professionals. <br><br>  Attempting to repair a failed refrigerator without special knowledge and experience can result in large losses.  Try to remake a landline phone into a mobile, and you will understand what is the meaning of this phrase.  What can we say about the computer, in particular - about its software? .. <br><br>  Information is something intangible, immaterial, physically non-existent.  You can rip the paper or break a CD, but you cannot adjust Windows with a wrench or even pat the case.  And at the same time, information is life.  Money.  Time.  Freedom.  Power if you want.  And of course, leisure. <br><br>  And so, the carrier of all these great goods is on your bedside table - it's just a laptop. <br><br>  "Laptop".  Shops are full of cheap and ‚Äúaffordable‚Äù, as well as (sometimes) comfortable and high-quality equipment.  Anyone can afford. <br><br>  What is he like?  How do you see it, this abstract, perfect computer?  What is he capable of, what would you like to see? <br><br>  Let's try to guess.  It must have an aesthetic appearance and be comfortable (egronomic).  Just have to be simple and straightforward.  The speed and "intelligence" of the control system (interface) is also necessary, although many donate them for the sake of economy.  Well. <br><br>  If you go deep, but our ‚ÄúPerfect Computer‚Äù will help you solve standard work tasks: create a document, spreadsheet, send a letter, visit interesting places (‚Äúsites‚Äù) on the Internet.  Chat with friends by voice or instant text communication.  Listen to music and watch a movie.  Perhaps a little play. <br><br>  This is where the insignificant complexity lurks at first glance - not a single newly acquired computer is capable of anything mentioned above.  Programs need to be installed and, more importantly, set up, access to the Internet ‚Äî to receive and secure, music and films ‚Äî to be able to run. <br><br>  Advertising, which is impossible to hide from nowadays, is replete with ‚Äúlucrative‚Äù offers - get something right now and you will get ... What?  Great computer?  Let's say. <br><br>  The difficulty is that any computer is great theoretically.  In some abstract situation, if ... a professional is sitting behind him. <br><br>  Statistical information: on average, a programmer spends up to three days on a complete computer setup for himself.  Just assembled or purchased machine.  THREE DAYS.  Only after that she is able to "how to" perform ... trivial tasks.  About professional speech is not. <br><br>  Do you still think you are buying a ready-made computer? <br><br>  We make a small digression. <br><br>  The perfect computer these days is first and foremost reliability.  Why?  Yes, because it will be necessary tomorrow and in five years.  Games and programs are changing, hard drives and the number of processor cores are growing ... and text documents and Internet pages will always be there.  And they will always be more valuable than gigabytes and gigabytes of movies, software distributions and music files. <br><br>  But what is the standard of this reliability? <br><br>  Check out some outdated machines.  Any experienced service engineer or programmer, having rummaged in his memory, will surely remember: among the whirlpools of new-fashioned superproductive systems, the islands of stability YEARS are ‚Äúprehistoric‚Äù PCs on a Pentium III or Athlon XP.  Moreover, these ‚Äúgrandfathers‚Äù of five to seven years old allow everything that is minimally necessary that even ‚Äúmodern‚Äù computers can read and view. <br><br>  This is really a computer "for centuries". <br><br>  Was it at the time of purchase prohibitively expensive?  No, at that time this configuration was only slightly more expensive than usual, simply assembled more professionally and from higher-quality components (note: it is the ‚Äútop-end‚Äù designed for professional tuning, the best hardware works for years and years, experts say). <br><br>  Was this particular computer something transcendental then?  Also no. <br><br>  Just its current owners did not save on quality.  The result exceeded all expectations. <br><br>  Where are the "budget" PCs, bought for reasons of "cheap and cheerful"?  It has long been forgotten in scrap metal dumps ... Or used in summer cottages as stands for table lamps. <br><br>  How, you ask, can an old computer be taught to work as well as a new one? <br><br>  It needs to be well-tuned.  So that he deals only with your tasks, and not with the fact that Microsoft developers who are interested have invested in it, do not forget, first of all to your own advantage, and only then in yours. <br><br>  Let's pay attention to what the store shelves are made of today.  Laptops are preloaded with Vista Home Basic ‚Ñ¢, "low cost" and "not very."  And this kit performs the same tasks as the computer seven years old.  And sometimes - only after setting.  Paradox, is not it?  Almost a decade - and not notice progress. <br><br>  What to do?  How to proceed?  Learn programming and fight with Vista yourself, one by one disabling all system extraneous and advertising modules?  Go to Linux and forget EVERYTHING you were taught before?  Do not buy a computer at all?  Look for some acquaintances, drink beer and listen to careless explanations of ‚Äúhow does it work‚Äù? <br><br>  The result of the above actions is unknown.  Happiness, if it is positive, and the machine will get some kind of working.  And if not?  Familiar can be illiterate adjusters, "hackers" who have done more harm than good.  Linux will not be given without a fight.  An independent study of the issue will take months, and is likely to be boring and of little use in ordinary life ... Unless, of course, you count free beer "as an acquaintance" ... <br><br>  Century of Professionals.  The author of this article will never sit down for the preparation of financial statements, will not try to write a masterpiece with a brush and a sketchbook, and will not sit behind the wheel of a truck.  Because this is not what he can do PROFESSIONALLY. <br><br>  Nowadays, the best organizations that provide computer assistance and computer repair services have reached a new, topical level - help in setting up a PC.  Of course, not every person you call home to set up a computer is a professional.  There is all.  But after all, it is easy to check who is in front of you: sociability, ability to explain the meaning of the necessary work and constant confidence in the ability to do everything - these are the three most important qualities of a high-level specialist. <br><br>  It can not be argued that such services are "cheap and angry."  A certified specialist who went to the house and provides high-level professional assistance is not a joke.  But only this option gives confidence in the future.  After all, the organization is bound by a rigid framework - mandatory warranty repairs on site, free consultations by telephone, only licensed, full-featured software.  Only Real Professionals. <br><br>  "Neighbor boy" who is fond of computers, anyone can invite to "tune up".  Serious people work primarily with specialists, for whom time and quality are more important than saving. <br><br>  You can easily determine who is in front of you - ‚Äúcall boy‚Äù or Professional.  Just ask him to tell him what he is capable of, ask him about the experience - and you will understand the difference.  <a href="http://fixcomputer.ru/itprofessional.html">IT professionals.</a> <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/40337/">https://habr.com/ru/post/40337/</a></p>
