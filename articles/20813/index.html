  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Apple clarifies details about the next generation input system</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The latest patent form, completed by Apple Inc., reveals the details of the multi-touch touch surface, which allows typing, pressing, scrolling the page and entering text manually - all in a single ergonomic device that is designed to replace the traditional peripherals: keyboard, mouse and digital panel. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://www.appleinsider.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/patent12.gif" alt="patent12.gif"></div><br><br>  Like the multi-touch trackpad form, the description of this concept takes 80 pages and is partially attributed to Wayne Westerman of Fingerworks, a company absorbed by <a href="http://www.appleinsider.ru/patent/49">Apple</a> several years ago, with the goal of releasing iPhones and new generation input devices.

      The form, signed on July 30, 2007 with many different names, illustrates a conceptual device that includes various types of input without mixing them together.  You do not need strong pressure or muscle movement. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  ‚ÄúFirst of all, it should be perceived by the user as mode-independent, that is, the user should not use specific signals to switch, such as pressing keys, changing hands or grabbing a stylus to change the input method to another,‚Äù Westerman writes. epidemiological studies have confirmed that repetitive force pressure stimulates permanent muscle damage.  Inconvenient poses, power to activate the device, unnecessary movements and repeatability of actions should be minimized to improve the ergonomics. " <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://www.appleinsider.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/patent13.gif" alt="patent13.gif"></div><br>  For this reason, the creator of the multi-touch mechanism, explained that the ideal application for his concept would be an apparatus with a multi-touch surface, which would correspond to the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcomfort and ergonomics during constant use.  It will be ‚Äúequipped with tactile buttons or manual input so that the hand, resting on the surface, does not stiffen, but gently slide along it.‚Äù <br><br>  The surface will include an electronic system that will provide a range of sensors with an image of approaching skin, and with such a resolution that the device can recognize different hands.  This will allow the device to identify different parts of the hand during contact with the surface, so that combinations of fingers and hand positions will be recognized to determine different types of input, ‚Äùsays Westerman. <br><br>  Another advantage of the ‚Äúmulti-touch‚Äù surface will be reliable operation during rotation and scaling, as well as an easy transition in managing multiple hands to help navigate and manipulate 2D electronic documents.  Moreover, it will be able to tilt and scroll without hand pressure, thus helping to manage three-dimensional applications. <br><br>  Westerman reports that the surface will be large enough to fit both hands comfortably on it, and made in a form that will reduce the pain of the forearm.  Text input, selection, scrolling and some multimedia features will be similar to existing Apple options on the iPhone and iPod touch.  In addition, handwriting recognition will be made thanks to the handle grasping module. <br><br>  In the setting mode of the handle, the module will determine whether the fingers touch the surface, and, if so, the module will begin to generate ink traces following the movement of the fingers and apply them to the communication device. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://www.appleinsider.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/patent14.gif" alt="patent14.gif"></div><br><br>  ‚ÄúThese ink marks can be splashed onto the display ‚Äî for drawing or copying a signature ‚Äî or they can simply be read by the handwriting recognition system and interpreted either as gestures or as symbols,‚Äù Westerman explained, ‚Äúif you lift your fingers, [the module] will send characters written with the stylus to the communication device, to the letter recognition system ". <br><br>  ‚ÄúIn some applications, a user may need to determine where to insert ink drawings, and where interpreted characters are solved by pointing the cursor,‚Äù Westerman continued, ‚Äúalthough the user can move the cursor on the multi-touch surface, leaving the manual writing and simply swiping your finger, it is preferable to use the cursor without closing the configuration of handwriting.  This can be done by moving the cursor with the pads of the fingers and the outer part of the joints.  And although normal hand movements also imply a slip of the fingers, palm movements will be ignored by the system until the fingers are raised above the surface for several hundred milliseconds. ‚Äù <br><br>  If the user uses a stylus for writing, then the tip is read by the system, as well as the fingers.  "For this reason, the handle hardening detector can function in exactly the same way as if the user wrote with the stylus, except that manual input will be sent directly to the communication system only when using the stylus." <br><br>  In addition to Westerman, the development for the form is attributed to Apple employee Jolny Elias (John Elias).  The concepts presented in the form clearly indicate the functions that will be in the next generation Apple Newton MessagePad or digital panels. <br><br>  via <a href="http://www.appleinsider.ru/patent/49">Appleinsider</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/20813/">https://habr.com/ru/post/20813/</a></p>
