  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Oracle Cloud Solution Overview</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Oracle is undoubtedly one of the leaders in the cloud services market.  About this segment of the activities of Oracle, the proposed products, its trends, we will talk further. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  For its partners, Oracle offers a full range of cloud solutions for all common service delivery models.  There are four such models in total. <br><br>  <b>Platform as a service (PaaS)</b> - the client gets access to information technology platforms, such as operating systems, databases, development tools and testing.  Oracle cloud platform is used to solve any problems and needs of IT business.  This, for example, could be application development.  Oracle has <i>Java Cloud, Database Cloud, Application Builder Cloud, Developer Cloud,</i> and others for similar purposes.  They allow you to create modern business applications in an accessible and understandable environment, while spending a minimum of effort and resources.

      <br>
      The platform is also used for data management.  It is suitable for any task - from development and testing to critical for the functioning of the business of data banks and transactional applications, and even big data analytics.  To do this, use the Oracle cloud tools such as <i>Big Data Cloud, Big Data Cloud Preparation, NoSQL Database Cloud, Database Backup Service</i> and others. <br><br>  Another solution to the Oracle cloud platform is business intelligence.  It uses the <i>Oracle Cloud Platform for Business Analytics</i> tool that allows you to collect and visualize data from different sources - cloud and local storage, big data repositories, the Internet of things or just files. <br><br>  For data integration provided by the <i>Oracle Cloud Platform Integration Service</i> .  It includes <i>Integration Cloud, Internet of Things Cloud and Messaging Cloud</i> .  With their help, the integration of cloud and local applications, as well as heterogeneous data sources and intelligent IoT devices is simplified and accelerated. <br><br>  The Oracle platform also helps organize collaboration between employees and partners on documents and projects.  <i>Documents Cloud</i> and <i>Process Cloud</i> are used for this.  They provide users with all the necessary tools for teamwork of employees wherever they are, ranging from neighboring departments of the office to various countries and continents. <br><br>  Finally, the mobile services platform is the <i>Oracle Cloud Platform for Mobile</i> .  This is a set of tools for quick, fast and convenient development of secure mobile applications. <br><br>  <b>Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)</b> is a model in which a client uses a cloud infrastructure to independently manage resources, for example, the means of processing and storing information in the cloud or computing power.  IaaS allows you to use any computing power necessary for business processes, as well as securely store important information and make backup copies of local data. <br><br>  In addition, it is possible to organize your own cloud.  For this purpose, the <i>Exadata Database Machine</i> systems of different generations (x5-2, x4-8) are used, as well as other optimized software and hardware systems.  In practice, everything is very simple.  In the simplest version, the client can start calculations using a mobile device or a weak office PC, which this device cannot do.  But since they will occur in the cloud, the result will only be displayed on the device.  And if we are talking about creating your own cloud, this allows, if necessary, temporarily (or permanently) to increase the performance of your own information system without buying expensive equipment.  The client simply rents the computing power and necessary services and pays only for what he uses. <br><br>  <b>Software as a Service (SaaS)</b> - providing the customer with the opportunity to work with programs from various devices such as thin clients or through a computer browser.  This eliminates the need for local installation of programs and the use of their own resources.  Also, do not need to buy licenses for software of different developers and significantly overpay at the same time.  Within this model, ready-made solutions for specific tasks are provided.  Among them, <i>Oracle HR Cloud</i> is a tool for personnel administration, personnel reserve management and work with social networks for personnel specialists.  <i>Oracle Customer Experience Cloud</i> is a platform for optimizing customer interaction.  <i>Oracle Enterprise Resource Planning Cloud</i> is an operational planning center with extensive financial and operational capabilities combined with the latest social, mobile, and analytical technologies.  <i>Oracle Enterprise Performance Management Cloud</i> is a budget planning tool.  <i>Oracle Supply Chain Management Cloud</i> is the management of material flows, and more simply, a means for effective decision making at any stage of the product's life cycle.  <i>Oracle Analytics Cloud</i> is a tool for processing analytical data including business analytics, as well as collecting, storing and analyzing all information assets of an organization.  <i>Oracle Applications Cloud</i> is a set of various applications that will facilitate the work with the cloud in all packages of services provided by the company. <br><br>  And the fourth model is <b>Data as a Service (DaaS)</b> , according to which the company gives access to application information.  This model provides <i>Oracle DaaS for Marketing</i> solutions (allows you to identify potential customers, analyze your audience and conduct multi-channel campaigns), <i>Oracle DaaS for Sales</i> (provides third-party data, including millions of companies, contacts and profiles in social networks to identify potential customers and classification of potential transactions) and <i>Oracle DaaS for Customer Intelligence</i> (business analytics aimed at increasing customer satisfaction). <br><br>  In addition to the standard cloud, Oracle allows you to create a <i>private cloud</i> for the company.  With it, the IT department can become a cloud service provider for the entire company based on its own infrastructure.  Also as part of the <i>Managed Cloud</i> service, Oracle provides companies with a range of services that are fully adaptable to the specific use of the cloud in a particular organization. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/511/df6/2a6/511df62a61674e5eaf6f7d352be470ab.jpg"><br>  <i>The three main options "clouds"</i> <br><br>  <b>Cloud Business Trends</b> <br><br>  Oracle provides its cloud services not only independently, but also in partnership with other vendors.  For example, together with Samsung Oracle creates a platform for the introduction of corporate cloud mobile services.  Leading system integrators help them in this.  The task is to reach a new level of functionality of mobile solutions and increase their productivity.  At the same time, investments that many companies have already made in the existing cloud infrastructure will not be in vain. <br><br>  Mobile access should be another feature based on existing infrastructure.  To this end, Oracle and Samsung are collaborating to create an extensive set of Apache Cordova plug-ins and code samples to help customers upgrade their enterprise applications by introducing mobile access features. <br><br>  Samsung and Oracle have already demonstrated several innovative solutions for corporate mobility and the Internet of things at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona.  This is, for example, a prediction solution for maintenance from HCL Technologies.  It is designed specifically for Samsung Gear S2 smart watches using the services of Oracle Internet of Things, Cloud Service and Oracle Service Cloud.  By analyzing data, it helps companies effectively reduce asset maintenance costs. <br><br>  Another development is a contract management solution from Sofbang.  It is designed to manage and approve contracts using the Samsung Gear S wearable alert system. Data security is provided by the Samsung KNOX system. <br><br>  Oracle's cloud business is growing and brings good dividends.  This can be seen simply by looking at the report for the third quarter of 2016, closed on February 29.  Cloud business sales have increased significantly - as much as 40%.  This is a great boost.  The profit reached the figure of $ 735 million. At the same time, all sales of the company grew by 1%.  Against this background, the growth of Oracle's cloud business looks even more impressive. <br><br>  Understanding the importance of the cloud business, Oracle, with the growth in sales of cloud services, increases investment in data centers.  In the near future - the opening of a modern data center in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates.  This is not surprising: the Middle East is one of the main regions in the cloud strategy of Oracle.  But the demand for cloud services is actively growing not only there.  For example, a data center in the city of Slough (United Kingdom) will receive PaaS functions (platform as a service).  This is the first planned investment in servicing UK government organizations. <br><br>  What is the reason for such a rapid growth in demand for cloud technologies?  The answer is simple - companies, firms, enterprises and organizations understand their importance.  They are interested in the clouds, such services are in demand, which means that suppliers feel good.  The research, which was conducted by Oracle experts, shows that more than 90% of organizations using cloud technologies are introducing innovations faster.  73% of respondents said that clouds also help retain existing customers, and 76% indicated that they have attracted new ones.  Already, almost 20% of companies have reached the "cloud maturity" in the development of private clouds.  And more than half of the respondents said they would come to this within two years.  As for the barriers to the deployment of hybrid cloud solutions in companies, the study revealed three key positions.  For 60%, this is the ability to manage a multitude of IT architectures, 57% of respondents noted network bandwidth, and 52% said that they had relationships with an IT provider. <br><br>  The rapid growth of Oracle's cloud business has also led to the fact that the company needs a lot of new employees.  Already, there is a significant expansion of staff in the EMEA region (Europe, Middle East and Africa).  There are plans to recruit 1,400 sales of cloud solutions.  Also this year, will open new modern offices in Dubai, Dublin and Prague. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fc3/8e8/560/fc38e85605764911872f7b764c5f2cb2.jpg"><br>  <i>Oracle Cloud Solution Structure</i> <br><br>  <b>What does the current year prepare for us?</b> <br><br>  2016 promises to bring a lot of changes to the IT industry, including in the cloud solutions segment.  Oracle experts told us what to expect in the current year. <br><br>  <i>Clouds will be more closely integrated with data centers</i> .  The company receives many offers for both cloud services and data centers.  But before they went apart.  Now, integrated requests will go in which customers want the cloud and data center to work together.  And that's why.  IT professionals understand that the key issue with public clouds is that they work very differently from corporate IT.  In most cases, the set of capabilities is different, management is different, and so on. And this makes it difficult to share public cloud services and IT systems that work directly in the enterprise.  Now the proposals will combine solutions for the infrastructure of the data center of the enterprise and cloud services built on the same architecture and supported by one vendor. <br><br>  <i>Homemade architectures are becoming less popular</i> .  Many companies fear to depend on a single vendor, so their infrastructure is often built on their own.  Then, in each layer of the stack, independent technologies are used, which have very little interconnection between them, and the company depends not on one, but on several vendors, which is also not the best option.  Now this practice is gradually becoming a thing of the past - infrastructure performance and data security are too important to build the infrastructure with all the risks of this approach.  Therefore, in 2016, more and more companies will resort to ready-made solutions that require only customization and fitting for certain tasks. <br><br>  <i>Optimization of infrastructure for specific tasks</i> .  It is very difficult to create an architecture suitable for all tasks in an enterprise.  The main problem is that using this approach, it is impossible to achieve optimization for maximum loads.  And as a result, the architecture either fails to withstand critical loads, or it costs the enterprise too much.  Therefore, in the current year, Oracle experts expect to see a new approach - the division of workloads into several directions and the optimization of each of them separately, rather than in a crowd. <br><br>  <i>Protecting information in new ways</i> .  In many enterprises, important information is stored in hundreds of databases.  This makes it extremely vulnerable, since each base requires separate protection measures.  The way to reduce risks is obvious - hard data consolidation and encryption.  And in terms of IT infrastructure - audit and control of users.  Therefore, many IT professionals will be engaged in the restructuring and optimization of databases.  They will unite in such "information fortresses". <br><br>  <i>Magnetic tape is back</i> .  It would seem that this archaic means of storing information remained only in museums and in the pages of science fiction works of the 50-80s of the last century.  But now she is again in demand.  The fact is that a large amount of information is not needed in constant access.  And in the matter of archiving the tape is very reliable and inexpensive to use.  Therefore, in 2016, the upgraded tape technologies will begin to force out disks in cloudy archive repositories. <br><br>  <i>Transformation industry</i> .  Last year there were significant changes in the market.  Hewlett-Packard split into two, Dell acquired EMC, and IBM got rid of most of the infrastructure business.  Contributed to this is the depersonalization of services provided and the spread of cloud technologies.  Indeed, without the provision of efficient cloud services, companies are becoming less attractive than those who provide them.  In 2016, these factors have not gone away, so we can expect even more dramatic events.  Business and product lines will shrink, and new cloud solutions will appear as well as disappear from the market. <br><br>  <b>New program of work with partners</b> <br><br>  But forecasts are predictions, and work is work.  In February of this year, Oracle launched a new partner program, the Oracle PartnerNetwork Cloud Program.  Its goal is to provide all the necessary tools for the development of cloud business and the use of modern models of its conduct.  This program has four levels - <i>Cloud Standard, Cloud Select, Cloud Premier and Cloud Elite</i> . <br><br>  The first level is designed for partners who have skills and expertise in Oracle Cloud services and usually focus on specific or specialized solutions within one of the key Oracle product lines. <br><br>  The second is designed for those who have a cloud Cloud specialization, as well as the experience of successful cooperation with customers in deploying solutions based on Oracle Cloud. <br><br>  The third group includes partners who have transformed the business in order to focus on the implementation of their replicable Oracle Cloud-based solutions from customers.  They receive technical assistance from the company, market development assistance and additional project support resources. <br><br>  The fourth level of the program is the highest.  It is intended for highly qualified partners who have made significant investments in working with various Oracle solutions and are ready to provide them to customers.  Such companies for Oracle are priority partners in market development.  They will take advantage of the closest collaboration to expand their joint cloud business. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4e3/8f9/0f2/4e38f90f2fa240f09cf0bc24d36a154b.jpg"><br>  <i>Periodic Table of Cloud Services</i> <br><br>  <b>What the client gets in practice</b> <br><br>  Oracle cloud services allow customers to solve all the problems that face modern IT departments of companies.  For example, <a href="http://www.oracle.com/ru/database/overview/index.html">Oracle cloud database</a> .  Getting them based on cloud architecture is easy.  You just need to go to the self-service portal and select the desired option with a specific version and configuration, in a separate virtual machine or inside Oracle virtualization.  The base can be both the most common and fault tolerant with various options.  A database is deployed in the cloud just a few clicks.  Backup and cloning of cloud databases is also happening quickly.  If on local resources such an operation can take up to a week (you need to allocate space, prepare and configure the equipment), then in the cloud this procedure will take about an hour. <br><br>  The same applies to data storage.  Oracle provides extensive cloud storage with the possibility of flexible configuration, simple management, the ability to quickly scan and scale. <br><br>  Another popular tool is <a href="http://www.oracle.com/ru/products/middleware/cloud-app-foundation/weblogic/overview/index.html">Oracle WebLogic Application Development Server</a> .  It allows you to develop and run high-performance corporate applications and services, including mobile, provides excellent performance, scalability and flexibility in the cloud and integrates with cloud databases, including multi-user. <br><br>  In addition to application development, Oracle provides its <a href="http://www.oracle.com/ru/products/applications/overview/index.html">own business solutions</a> .  These are tools for enterprise resource planning and performance management, working with customers, managing human capital and supply chains, a variety of industrial applications and product line applications. <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Oracle also has a set of tools that allow you to confidently </font></font><a href="http://www.oracle.com/ru/products/applications/application-integration-architecture/overview/index.html"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">integrate applications</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , both Oracle and third-party developers.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And of course the customer gets all the benefits of using cloud technologies in comparison with local services. This is the speed of deployment of resources - depending on the task, deployment and configuration take from several minutes in the simplest cases to several days when the customer wants everything to the maximum. This cannot be compared with the deployment of local resources, where only the selection and delivery of equipment can take weeks. Using the cloud, you can be sure that all data and services will be available 24/7. According to modern standards, the lack of access to services is allowed only a few hours a year. The same goes for data security. In the cloud, they are reliably protected both from hacker attacks and from the physical access of outsiders to the servers. And of course the financial aspect.In the cloud, the customer pays exactly for the resources he needs. With local systems, it often happens that expensive equipment is idle or idling. And scalability and load balancing allows you to quickly add the necessary power to the cloud or remove unnecessary.</font></font></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/282614/">https://habr.com/ru/post/282614/</a></p>
