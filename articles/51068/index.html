  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Interview with the owner of the domain aeroport74.ru</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  At my request, the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/webdev/50651/">situation with the airport domain</a> , which caused a mixed reaction from the habrasoobshchestva, <a href="http://sergey.pavlenko.org/%3Fp%3D94">commented the</a> head of the web group ‚ÄúDouble U‚Äù Sergey Pavlenko.  It turned out that they watered mud, not knowing the case.  But in general, maybe there is wine ‚ÄúDouble U‚Äù, everything was very ambiguous at first glance. <br><br>  In general, what Sergey wrote, you can read the <a href="http://sergey.pavlenko.org/%3Fp%3D94">link</a> yourself.  I don‚Äôt see the point of bringing all the text from the blog here, and you can read everything there.  I tried to summarize the popular comments that were added to <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/webdev/50651/">this</a> post, and I compiled a list of questions on them. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>You were called Chelyabinsk cyber-gopnik, is it true or false?</b>

      And what is cyber gopnik?  Any new phenomenon in the network?  If this somehow concerns the possibility to outbid a domain is more expensive, then it is cyber major, most likely.  And the cyber-gopnik in RuNet is a finite number, they can be counted on the fingers and the fact that this phrase was sounded in our address only confirms that it was written without thinking. <br><br>  <b>Many commentators claim that your way of working enhances the anti-advertising effect for the company.</b>  <b>What do you think about that?</b> <br><br>  If all of the approvers lead the development team in their projects, then it is worth thinking about it.  But it seems to me that this is an unsubstantiated statement.  We just beat the situation in the classical sequence: talked about what was long overdue in the industry.  What has been happening for a long time.  Not everyone understood what they were talking about.  With regards to "anti-advertising", I bet.  This is not true. <br><br>  <b>There was an opinion that there is no need for customers to know all the details of the Internet business.</b>  <b>You, on the contrary, say that you need to train the client.</b>  <b>What for?</b> <br><br>  I‚Äôm not so much saying that the client needs to be taught everything, but at least it‚Äôs necessary to make it clear that there are a lot of subtleties, indicating examples of ‚Äúfrom life‚Äù.  After all, having fallen for one, even the smallest absurdity, in a year, two, three, you can see how the money invested disappears because of one stupid mistake at the beginning of the journey. <br><br>  <b>Have you been developing websites for a long time?</b>  <b>Where does such a desire to punish "drafts" (word taken from the <a href="http://sergey.pavlenko.org/%3Fp%3D94">publication</a> )?</b> <br><br>  You know, no, not really.  Since 2003.  In this industry in general, in my opinion, there is no limit to perfection.  But we recently have significant team efforts to go to work with venture projects like j2j.ru and others like him.  Different startups are born, as is now fashionable to say.  But all this does not mean that we do not follow the development of the industry in our region.  <a href="http://w74.ru/analytics/chel/">An annual analytical section</a> on the domains of the Chelyabinsk region was carried out, and we will continue to follow.  Incompetence, in my opinion, must always be fought. <br><br>  <b>Were you not declared persona non grata at the airport?</b> <br><br>  I do not know, the last time I flew before it happens.  More was not there.  But thanks for the tip, I will keep this in mind when planning future trips. <br><br>  <b>Sorry, I am not a journalist by profession at all, and all I wanted was asked by you.</b>  <b>All the best, good projects to you.</b> <br><br>  Thank you for your attention to the problem.  All participants habr also thanks for the reaction.  And for the bad, and for the patient.  Do not be afraid to do what you are sure of and where you are ready to prove your confidence to the end. <br><br>  <b>-</b> <br><br>  Do not scold my questions too much, before I did not have to work with this at all.  But as I could, I found out about the situation.  I was pleased that we managed to do everything quickly.  It seemed to me that it would take a very long time to look for someone with whom you can talk on the subject. <br><br>  From a conversation with Sergey on ICQ, I learned that through the feedback from the site they wrote some nasty things, there is a literal example (spelling is preserved): <br>  <i>‚ÄúDue to the fact that the issue of selling the domain aeroport74.ru depends only on the named amount, I hasten to call you fucking cybersquatters not to love your city and country (I read about you in the internet, I think many people agree with me, your company's reputation has been undermined) "</i> <br>  And there were several, as I understood. <br><br>  What dug himself about Pavlenko: <br>  <a href="http://telnews.ru/Dmitrij_Rodin/c51216/">One</a> , <a href="http://www.seonews.ru/events/detail/44305.php">two</a> , <a href="http://www.seonews.ru/events/detail/43735.php">three</a> , <a href="http://vitvirtual.com/post_1219132678.html">four</a> .  I have no reason to doubt the competence of a person.  That's why I wrote at the beginning of the post that I feel embarrassed, too black I got the feed of previous materials. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/51068/">https://habr.com/ru/post/51068/</a></p>
