They are made by both well-known companies and manufacturers from China, which no one has ever heard of.  It is clear that among all this variety there are high-quality devices, and there are gadgets that can not be called good even with a stretch. <br><br>  What to do if you want to buy a fitness tracker with a fairly good set of functions, but you don‚Äôt want to spend a lot of money, plus you don‚Äôt want to burn yourself by purchasing a low-quality device?  For this case, we have prepared a selection (of course, subjective) of budget devices ($ 25- $ 100) with a brief description of each device. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Xiaomi Mi Band 2 </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c7a/735/ac6/c7a735ac6d85ce24cebcff86ffcdabb7.jpg" width="850">

      This tracker, like the previous models of activity trackers from Xiaomi, consists of two parts.  The first is a capsule with an electronic filling (sensors, wireless communication modules, etc.).  The second is a rubber bracelet.  The main difference from previous models is the presence of a monochrome display, where the user can see basic information about his activity, quality of sleep, etc.  There is a heart rate monitor. <br><br>  The gadget is able to count the steps and calories expended, tracks the distance traveled, monitors the quality of sleep.  There is an alarm clock that works well - from personal experience, a light vibration, with the help of which this device wakes up, acts much softer than the sound of a regular alarm clock that immediately pulls a person out of Morfei‚Äôs embrace. <br><br>  Another feature is the ability to unlock the smartphone using the tracker. <br><br>  This bracelet is sold in <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/xiaomi-mi-band-2/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dbudget_track">our catalog</a> . <br><br><h3>  Amazfit arc </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/910/5b0/b57/9105b0b57c73e72c296b1112de9c9d4b.jpg" width="850"><br><br>  Outwardly, the tracker is somewhat similar to the previous device.
