  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Remart: how I created my business</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h4>  <i>Part II: An Important Decision</i> <br></h4><br><br>  Remember I talked about the beginning of his business Remart?  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/139498/">Here is the</a> first part of my story. <br><br>  Continuing the theme of investors: so, I did not take the money from that investor, because I received another offer, which I could not refuse.  You can simply take the money, but it is very important to understand who you take this money from.  I had several offers for different amounts, but all this money cost differently.  The first and most obvious is that each of the potential investors requested a different share.  But do not forget that in addition to the amount and share, you also can not discount the one who gives the money.  I was attracted by one offer more than others, because <i>I knew a potential investor</i> .  I knew that I could rely on him, and that along with his money - I get a lot more.  I get an enthusiastic strong team member who can become one of the project Leaders.  For me at that time it was decisive, because the idea without implementation is just a fantasy.  A strong team is much more valuable than an idea.  A strong team is able to realize, if not this idea, then any other, which are very much around.  Among startups, the phrase about the concept of ‚ÄúFFF‚Äù (Friends, Family, Fanatis) is spinning.  It worked for me on friends.

We began to work, gradually to monitor the market and various tests to understand the vitality of our idea.  Next, it was necessary to complete the team.  <i>A team is a great value than a pure idea,</i> of which I am convinced.  We were lucky: we have gathered great people, inspired, talented, everyone wants to work and move mountains, so I thought.  The reality was different.  Our main mistake is not to combine the project with any other work.  It would seem that not in one book it is written about it, but you understand it clearly when you yourself fall into such a trap.  This mistake cost us dearly.  We could have opened the project much earlier if we initially recruited people for full-time work.  Having calculated the main obstacle, we adjusted our tactics on human capital management.  Yes, I had to tinker, but we were able to resolve this issue. <br><br>  <i>Planning.</i>  The question is: need to implement it or not?  We failed all plans and deadlines.  I could not understand why.  Are we making them so wrong or not working?  Our team has experienced managers who have repeatedly made plans that were executed in other places, we hardly lost our competence in such a short time.  I could not answer these questions, or rather for myself, I noted that this is due to the extremely high motivation and lack of focus on one project.  We just really, really wanted everything to turn out much faster.  In general, immediately.  We were able to overcome this trap, then most of the team people focused on one of our projects.  We were able to pull ourselves together and soberly assess the situation, then our plans began to gradually come closer to reality. <br><br>  This step is very important.  I would recommend that everyone find an opportunity to leave their old work as soon as possible and start working on a new idea.  Sometimes it's scary, sometimes it's not easy.  Sometimes the family and the closest associates hold you back: they do not want, they resist and do not understand why you need it.  I want to make absolutely clear to you that only you need this.  Your environment has become accustomed to seeing you as you are and indeed few of them are aware that the only reason why they are dissuading you is their fear and rejection of change.  The changes that will affect you and through you to them.  Yes, and envy you, what is there to hide. <br><br>  Now we had to do the most important thing at this stage of starting a business - to form a single team of all people.  In the next article I will tell you how we did it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/141703/">https://habr.com/ru/post/141703/</a></p>
