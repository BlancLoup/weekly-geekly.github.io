I added a few friends (mostly from former classmates), drove a job search that interests me a couple of times, and in the end I successfully forgot about my account.  I only remembered about him when notifications like ‚ÄúYou may know these people‚Äù or ‚ÄúCompanies are looking for specialists like you‚Äù came to the post office.  Eychary from recruiting companies, who found my resume on a head-hunter, prevailed among possible friends, and almost all of the firms ‚Äúin dire need of‚Äù my candidacy were foreign. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Immediately the impression was that LinkedIn was imprisoned for applicants with a good command of a foreign (English) language and interested in international experience.  Among the endless ‚Äúskills required‚Äù and ‚Äúresponsibilities‚Äù job descriptions in Russian were very rare. <br><br>  Checking my page after a long absence has been triggered by a recent data <a href="https://tjournal.ru/28383-lichnie-dannie-polzovatelei-linkedin-vistavili-na-prodazhu-v-tenevom-internete">leak</a> , as a result of which 120 million logins and passwords of LinkedIn users were stolen.  Fortunately, I did not find any suspicious activity in my account, changed the password, canceled a couple of applications from strangers, and again forgot about this resource.

      And yesterday, again at the top of Yandex, I saw the <a href="http://izvestia.ru/news/640772">news</a> about the long-suffering LinkedIn: now they are going to block it in Russia.  I tried to figure out what led to this and what the future of business social networks in Russia is. <br><br>  You can <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/301312/">read</a> about the many shortcomings of this network with different bloggers.  I would like to dwell on a specific problem - ‚Äúbrain drain‚Äù. <br><br>  Today VTsIOM statistics was <a href="http://www.kp.ru/online/news/2551372/">published</a> , according to which the number of people who want to go for permanent residence abroad is very significant (11%, and in 1991 it was 16%). <br><br>  Here is a good illustration of the emigrant sentiments of Russian citizens: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0ea/d97/a89/0ead97a892ffb97a8ddcb3aebbf81c5e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Of course, the formation of such views directly depends on social status.  It is clear that in Moscow there are more people who want to ‚Äúdump‚Äù (this is the word I often hear from friends), even more among those traveling on business trips around the world. <br><br>  Such people know how to make the move in practice, while the majority of those ‚Äúdreaming of blaming‚Äù are citizens who are simply dissatisfied with the political course.  The easiest way to get a job abroad is for employees of foreign companies, especially top managers, whose financial position and level of skills will make it easier to integrate into their new homeland.  It is not by chance that top managers are in the first place on the list of people planning labor emigration, 42% of whom are <a href="http://www.kp.ru/daily/26552.4/3568577/">planning</a> to leave Russia. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7ae/079/f40/7ae079f400cc19de613b5fea9bb9780f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I do not think that only LinkedIn is to blame for all this, by no means.  But for Western HR specialists, this professional network is a convenient tool for performing their work.  Without special difficulties, personnel officers in Germany or the United States remotely investigate potential employees.  And what our top manager is not a candidate - he got a good education, has experience, knows the Russian market and corporate secrets, he has good connections.  Such a frame will bring good money to the multinational corporation. <br><br>  With the advent of the crisis, ambitious cadres began to carefully study the western labor market, they also pay in euros, life seems more comfortable, etc.  Which categories <a href="http://alenavl.livejournal.com/271249.html">come</a> into the focus of HR of other countries in the first place?  This programmers, engineers, especially the military, doctors.  Military experts can tell some state secret. <br><br>  I‚Äôm tormented by the question: foreign services have already started to have domestic counterparts, data centers are being built, etc.  And why did Linkedin never have a strong domestic counterpart? <br><br>  In absolute terms, the Russian-speaking audience of LinkedIn <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/301312/">is small</a> : in June 2015 there were about 3 million people.  And most of these users do not go there for years.  So why don't we develop our resource and ‚Äúhunt‚Äù foreign specialists? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/369809/">https://habr.com/ru/post/369809/</a></p>
