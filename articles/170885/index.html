      Do they live up to the wait?  In truth, today Google Glass looks more like a smartphone attached to the head than a real device that creates the augmented reality that was shown in the video on YouTube.  Points can neither impose tags on reality, or grids and maps, nor show a running line with information about everything that you look at.  And, despite all attempts by Google to present glasses as an element of high fashion, they are crying out "We are a geek!"  ‚ÄúMost of us use Google every day,‚Äù <a href="http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/tue-april-10-2012/the-social-networth---google-unveils-smart-glasses---facebook-buys-instagram">notes</a> American comedian <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D1%2582%25D1%258E%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D1%2582,_%25D0%2594%25D0%25B6%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD_%2528%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D1%2583%25D1%2589%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9%2529">John Stewart</a> , ‚Äúbut have you ever thought‚Äú the problem with Google is that it‚Äôs too far from my face ‚Äù? <br><br>  At the moment, the information that is on Google Glass is very fragmentary.  Here is what we know.  This is a lightweight headband that looks like ordinary reading glasses, but without glasses, the handle of which is stuffed with almost the same electronics as the one that is in a modern mobile phone running Android.  There is a microprocessor, memory, battery, speaker, two microphones, video camera, Wi-Fi antenna, Bluetooth, accelerometer, gyroscope and compass.  Also, a micro display is located above one user's eye. <br><br>  This equipment allows the owner of Google Glass to record their conversations, and what surrounds it, automatically take a photo every 10 seconds and send recordings to the cloud.  Points can be controlled both by voice control and by pressing the handle, which is also a touchpad.  The prototype can connect to the Internet using Wi-Fi or using Bluetooth and a smartphone.  The following versions, apparently, will also contain a mobile antenna. <br><br>  Google claims that the glasses will be light enough, small and stylish, and they can be worn all day long, without removing them, like a favorite sweater or comfortable sneakers.  Google Glass glasses will run applications such as Google Search and Google+, but they are designed to be more natural and exciting than a computer or smartphone.  As Babak Parviz, Project Glass Project Manager, told Google developers at the Google I / O conference in June, ideally Google Glass glasses will allow access to the information ‚Äúhow fast you will feel that you simply know it‚Äù. <br><br>  And there is.  Google claims that you can feel smarter with Google Glass.  ‚ÄúWe are talking about a device that sees everything that you see, and hears everything that you hear,‚Äù says artificial intelligence researcher and business angel <a href="http://bitcortex.com/">Rod Furlan</a> .  "From the moment you started using glasses, you can <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2592%25D1%2581%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D1%258C_%25D0%25B2%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5">remember everything</a> ." <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4af/2f5/237/4af2f5237ee3a0a67a20f59068b75a4f.jpg"><br>  <sup>Am i smart</sup>  <sup>According to Google, Google Glass glasses will allow access to the information ‚Äúhow fast, that it will seem to you that you just know it.‚Äù</sup>  <sup>Photo: Google</sup> <br><br>  However, in order to become something more than just a niche product, Google Glass will need to overcome a number of obstacles. <br><br>  First is the competition.  "If Google Glass is commercially successful, then everyone will start creating similar displays and interfaces," predicts <a href="http://web.media.mit.edu/~sandy/">Alex Sandy, Pentland,</a> director of the Human Dynamics laboratory at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. <br><br>  The competition is already underway.  Startups like <a href="http://www.atheertech.com/">Atheer</a> , <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/qolt/AboutQoLTCenter/PressRoom/ces-2012/first-person-vision.html">First Person Vision</a> , <a href="http://www.lumusvision.com/">Lumus</a> , and <a href="http://vergencelabs.com/">Vergence Labs</a> all have prototypes similar to Google Glass in development.  Private company <a href="http://www.reconinstruments.com/products/snow-heads-up-display">Recon Instruments produces a special MOD Live device</a> , an overhead display for skiers that analyzes their jumps.  Reputable companies such as Apple, Microsoft, Olympus, and Sony have for many years been conducting research on smart glasses and headlamps. <br><br>  All of this activity can ultimately lead to a healthy market for smart glasses, says Theo Ahadome, a leading analyst at <a href="http://www.imsresearch.com/">IMS, a British market research company</a> .  According to Ahadome, if Google Glass is favorably received by the first users, despite the fact that at the moment the turnover of this market is less than a million dollars, by 2016 it can grow to seven hundred million.  And then if such points become popular among the masses, then this amount can jump to several billion. <br><br>  It seems that Google Glass was a kind of lifeline for its area, which for several decades struggled for existence.  In May, shortly before Google Glass, <a href="http://www.vuzix.com/home/">Vuzix Corporation</a> , a company that has been in existence for 20 years and which produces devices for creating an augmented reality, was introduced to the public, indicated in the application for the Securities and Exchange Commission (USA) that ‚Äúthere are certain doubts about the possibility of continuing our activities. " <br><br>  However, after Google presented Google Glass to the public, Vuzix renegotiated its loan agreements, signed a development contract with the US Army, and announced the release of its version of smart glasses, resembling Google Glass glasses, by the beginning of 2013.  Operating on the Android 4.0 operating system, the <a href="http://www.vuzix.com/site/_news/2012/Press-Release-11-13-12-M100-Final.pdf">Vuzix Smart Glasses M100 smart glasses received an award for best innovation this year</a> at the international consumer electronics show in Las Vegas.  ‚ÄúGoogle makes people think about the new impressions they can get with the help of new transparent displays and sensors,‚Äù says Paul Travers, CEO and founder of Vuzix. <br><br>  But even Google will have to convince people that they have a computer on their nose, all day long, this is what they want.  However, even technophiles are hard to convince.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not particularly interested in Google Glass because, even though I‚Äôm passionate about the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãaugmented reality, Google Glass isn‚Äôt that at all,‚Äù <a href="http://www.wired.com/beyond_the_beyond/">science fiction writer Bruce Sterling</a> wrote in an e-mail to IEEE Spectrum magazine.  "Google Glass is more like an Android-attached computer attached to the head, and there‚Äôs almost nothing to do with dynamic interaction with 3D virtual images." <br><br>  Professor of the University of Toronto, <a href="http://genesis.eecg.toronto.edu/">Steve Mann</a> , who in the eighties was an innovator in the development of devices similar to Google Glass, said that, apparently, Google repeats the same design errors that he made in his early prototypes.  In particular, he says that the location of the microdisplay outside the natural human field of view can lead to eye fatigue and blurred pictures.  ‚ÄúThey don't make you smarter.  They confuse you even more, and they feel dizzy, ‚Äùhe says, and adds that the screen should be located directly in front of the eyes, as in a device he developed called EyeTap. <br><br>  But even if Mann‚Äôs concerns prove to be groundless, the battery capacity and complexity of data processing required by Google Glass are still a big problem.  Any application that is associated with machine vision and video stream processing will almost certainly require a lot of energy and computational resources.  According to the information currently available, the battery energy is now only enough for six hours.  Some developers also show discontent about the price tag of a half thousand dollars for early prototypes.  Probably, custom versions of Google Glass will cost less. <br><br>  However, let's assume that Google was able to convince millions of users.  What will happen then?  Proponents of privacy warned that Google Glass and similar devices could lead to an unprecedented loss of control over personal information. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe question is what will Google do with the information it collects,‚Äù said Rebecca Jeschke, a spokesperson for the <a href="https://www.eff.org/">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> , the leading group on privacy rights.  While the company has not opened any privacy policy in relation to Google Glass, but the fact that the data is placed in the cloud, suggests that it can be accessed by third parties.  At the moment, US law allows law enforcement agencies, under certain circumstances, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/09/us/cell-carriers-see-uptick-in-requests-to-aid-surveillance.html%3F_r%3D0">to access e-mail and citizens ‚Äômobile phone records,</a> even without a warrant.  The governments of Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom are also seeking to expand their electronic resource monitoring capabilities. <br><br>  Alex Pentland of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology objects that the threat to privacy can be reduced if companies like Google give users complete control over their data.  It also does not hurt to make sure that people know when they are recorded.  This can also help.  In addition, he adds, governments are already putting pressure on corporations to enforce stricter privacy policies.  The <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/02/23/we-can-t-wait-obama-administration-unveils-blueprint-privacy-bill-rights">Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights,</a> announced by the White House last February, and the <a href="http://www.edri.org/edrigram/number10.6/eu-us-privacy-commitments">joint declaration on the protection of personal information</a> signed by the United States and the European Union last March, show that the world is moving in the right direction, says he. <br><br>  Others consider such arm twisting in matters of confidentiality to be outdated.  ‚ÄúSoon we will live in an absolutely transparent society, and we can‚Äôt do anything about it,‚Äù said Rod Furlan, an artificial intelligence researcher.  "One should not fight with the future, but learn to live with it." <br><br>  Furlan so eager to see what the future might look like with Google Glass, that he could not resist and last summer he <a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/geek-life/hands-on/build-your-own-google-glass">created his own prototype of ready-made components</a> .  The prototype shows Furlan on a monocular microdisplay of e-mail messages, updates on twitter, text messages, and the status of his servers.  At first, he says, such a flow of information seemed exorbitant, but now taking off his gadget, he feels "depleted." <br><br>  He waits will not wait for the opportunity to try real Google Glass.  Furlan is sure that Google‚Äôs experience in data processing and machine learning will lead to the creation of a wide variety of applications enriching everyday life.  Yes, he says, it is necessary to sacrifice some confidentiality, but this is a justified concession.  "I am sure that technology ultimately gives more than it selects," he sums up. <br><br>  <b>about the author</b> <br>  The editor in the cloud communications company, <a href="http://www.twilio.com/">Twilio</a> , <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/eliseackerman">Eliza Ackermann</a> , since 2006 began to cover the company's activities in the media.  In the same year she underwent laser vision correction.  Will Google Glass be able to convince her to wear glasses again?  ‚ÄúThe enthusiasm of Google Glass supporters is truly infectious,‚Äù says Akkerman, ‚ÄúBut in order for me to return to the points, they will need to have some kind of killer app.‚Äù </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/170885/">https://habr.com/ru/post/170885/</a></p>
