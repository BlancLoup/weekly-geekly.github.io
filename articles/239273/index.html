A lot of here and those who were on the local Java One - in Moscow.  I also have long wanted to visit the main and original Java One - in San Francisco - and this was finally possible.  I invite everyone interested to hear my impressions of the event and some of its sessions. <br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/40/Wave.svg" alt="Duke, Java Mascot and Java One"><br>  Duke, Java Mascot and Java One <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Java one is being held in San Francisco in early October since 1996, under the leadership of Sun Microsystems first, and after the sale of the latter, by Oracle Corporation.  This Java One was, in a sense, a jubilee one, since  May will be 20 years since the creation of the Java language.  Since the purchase of Sun by a large corporation of a large database, the Oracle Open World conference has been held in parallel, so some of the notes will apply to it too. <br><br><h3>  Some personal notes not directly related to the conference. </h3><br>  I, by the will of fate, now work in the bay area and live there, so unlike most conference participants, I did not live in a hotel, but traveled to San Francisco on the 101st highway leaving at 7 am to catch the first session and came back at 9-10 pm after the last session - the schedule was very stressful, even though it was 5 days.  Even from domestic difficulties - lunch and dinner at the conference were spread very much, as a result of which there were few listeners at the last sessions - everyone ran to lunch.

    <h3>  Discovery and General Information </h3><br>  Java one 2014 was held for 5 days from Sunday (September 28) to Thursday (October 2) plus on Saturday was trained at Java University (for an additional fee for an entry level) and on Wednesday was common for two Oracle Appreciation Event conferences ( at night). <br><br>  In general, the conference immediately strikes with its scale - the whole center of the city is plastered with posters, advertising: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1f8/1f5/9a1/1f81f59a155043959fb8ca1838904aa7.jpg"><br><br>  The conference itself takes place in the Moscone Center, which lies between the skyscrapers (there were mainly oracle exhibitions and lectures - except for resurrection) and in two hotels: Hilton and Park 55. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b69/b97/ca1/b69b97ca140e48478c403123a33c0c0e.jpg"><br>  Moscone west <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/59d/74c/076/59d74c07669242968219c475ecd41284.jpg"><br>  Moscone south <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e91/db3/cb9/e91db3cb988046949250efba0a08808b.jpg"><br>  Moscone North and skyscrapers <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f16/a21/bb9/f16a21bb9fea43d8b4501c3025190511.jpg"><br>  Moscone North, skyscrapers and dining tables. <br><br>  By the way, on this screen, all the main lectures were broadcast - it was possible to have breakfast and listen to them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/75d/f04/648/75df0464893544c98047d11bab33d52b.jpg"><br>  Park 55 <br><br><h3>  Lectures </h3><br>  There were many lectures, 560 on Java one and another 2000 on Oracle Open World and, to my surprise, there were a lot of lectures on the topic of internet of things - around 100, when, for example, only 50 lectures were spoken about other languages ‚Äã‚Äãon JVM .  However, IoT is now so trendy that they even spoke at the introductory remarks: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/049/ee7/17f/049ee717f97141d88d618482413bfcdf.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/01a/bd3/08d/01abd308d67f4b30b7c79843a822324c.jpg"><br><br>  The second slide is a demonstration in record time of the built system of auto stimulator assembled from a conventional TV, MS Kinect, several sensors and microchips from very different manufacturers. <br><br>  The reports were, on average, much less technologically advanced than in Moscow, but there were also simply pearls, which I will now discuss. <br><br><h4>  Mobprogramming </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/58c/561/527/58c5615276344041b574513cf4d3841d.jpg"><br>  This is a very lively and interesting story from the category of project management and extreme programming about the team that turned out.  They have expanded the practice of pair programming and sit at one monitor with five developers, one project manager and one agile trainer.  But at the same time they refused to evaluate the tasks, meetings and practically solved the task of giving birth to a baby in a few months. <br>  More information can be found on their website: <a href="http://mobprogramming.org/">mobprogramming.org</a> <br><br><h4>  Faster object arrays </h4><br>  It was a deep technical lecture on creating an extremely fast data structure that does not have an overlay like ArrayList (following a link + objects can be in different places of memory).  Strive for the speed of struct [] in C and the convenience of processing collections in Java (their structure extends Iterable and enables inheritance for further expansion).  Hoping to appear in OpenJDK 9 <br>  <a href="http://objectlayout.org/">objectlayout.org</a> <br><br><h4>  Using Type Annotations to Improve Code Quality </h4><br>  Behind this name, which promises nothing, actually hides exactly the silver bullet that does not exist.  Specifically, they gracefully solved the problems of validating objects during static analysis.  For example, one billion dollar mistake was solved with null references.  And they decided it in such a way that the solution will work even on the old code.  Example: <br><br><pre><code class="java hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span></span> <span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span></span></span><span class="hljs-class"> </span><span class="hljs-title"><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-title">NullnessExample</span></span></span><span class="hljs-class"> </span></span>{ <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span></span></span><span class="hljs-function"> </span><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">static</span></span></span><span class="hljs-function"> </span><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">void</span></span></span><span class="hljs-function"> </span><span class="hljs-title"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">main</span></span></span><span class="hljs-params"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">(String[] args)</span></span></span><span class="hljs-function"> </span></span>{ Object myObject = <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">new</span></span> Object(); System.out.println(myObject.toString()); } }</code> </pre>  compiles, runs <br><br><pre> <code class="java hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span></span> <span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span></span></span><span class="hljs-class"> </span><span class="hljs-title"><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-title">NullnessExample</span></span></span><span class="hljs-class"> </span></span>{ <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span></span></span><span class="hljs-function"> </span><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">static</span></span></span><span class="hljs-function"> </span><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">void</span></span></span><span class="hljs-function"> </span><span class="hljs-title"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">main</span></span></span><span class="hljs-params"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">(String[] args)</span></span></span><span class="hljs-function"> </span></span>{ Object myObject = <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">null</span></span>; System.out.println(myObject.toString()); } }</code> </pre>  gives an error message <blockquote>  dereference of possibly-null reference myObject <br>  System.out.println (myObject.toString ()); </blockquote><br>  ... runs as a javac mod or IDE plugin.  And this is not the limit, they want to overcome in this way all RuntimeException. <br>  <a href="http://types.cs.washington.edu/checker-framework/">types.cs.washington.edu/checker-framework</a> <br><br><h4>  Internet of boats </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/55d/33d/b59/55d33db595ce4e0c81861a504d90451f.jpg"><br><br>  This is quite an interesting story from Brazilians about how they connected their yacht to the Internet, how they chose technologies and hardware, how they reduced power consumption.  The story was enriched by measuring the indicators on the air after putting things under the sensor.  Unfortunately, the slides with the details turned out to be illuminated, and the blog in Spanish. <br><br>  <a href="https://github.com/vsenger/boat-gateway">github.com/vsenger/boat-gateway</a> <br>  <a href="http://blog.globalcode.com.br/search/label/Yara">blog.globalcode.com.br/search/label/Yara</a> <br><br><h4>  Java ME not dead </h4><br>  In contrast to the previous paragraphs, this is not the name of a separate session, but what the group of sessions prepared at the St. Petersburg office of <s>Sun</s> Oracle was for me at once.  If you go even a little deeper than the surface - you‚Äôll have an article and not one.  If briefly, Java ME not only did not die with the arrival of phones under the android, but now it runs on microprocessors, supports all language features, has a garbage collector and multithreading, and allows debugging and easy management.  In general, happiness for all the gift and let no one go offended.  I think the authors of the reports themselves can tell in more detail. <br>  <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/javame/">blogs.oracle.com/javame</a> <br><br><h3>  Exhibitions </h3><br><h4>  Java one </h4><br>  Exhibitions worked 3 days, from Monday to Wednesday.
