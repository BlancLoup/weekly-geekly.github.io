My name is Bibi, my colleague is Bob and we are two ... team leaders, a long time ago in the project, we know everything todo by heart and today we will talk about your knowledge and skills. <br>  Your CV says that you are senior, you work mostly with .NET, you understand asynchronous and multi-threaded programming, you know the basics of algorithms and data structures, you have experience in refactoring and designing large modules from scratch.  And yet, it is impossible not to ask this stupid question: tell us briefly about yourself? <br>  - Hello, Bibi and Bob.  I still work mainly with .NET, I understand asynchronous and multi-threaded programming, I am confident in the basics of algorithms and data structures, and I have experience in both refactoring and designing large modules from scratch.  This is in brief. <br>  - Thank.  Well, let's start!  For warming up something simpler: how do you know the trees and their crawling methods? <br>  - Oak, acacia, maple, cherry ... So immediately nothing more comes to mind.  As for the tree walk, you can go around from the different sides: left or right.  I also know that you can climb a tree and that there are hollows in the trees, where squirrels sometimes live. <br>  - Good.  Then this question - what is the difference between transferring an object by reference and copying it completely? <br>  - The difference is that in the first case the object is passed by reference, and in the second case it is completely copied. <br>  - What do you know about graphs? <br>  - I deeply respect the work of Count Lev Nikolayevich Tolstoy, as a child I read the book ‚ÄúCount Monte Cristo‚Äù.  And who does not know Count Dracula ?! <br>  - What is ‚ÄúSOLID‚Äù? <br>  - ‚ÄúSolid‚Äù, less often - ‚Äúcontinuous‚Äù.  Depends on the context, of course. <br>  - How does the garbage collector work? <br>  ‚ÄúI know that too.‚Äù  A typical garbage collector is wearing a bright orange jumpsuit and safety shoes.  It works mainly at night - on the garbage truck.  The main task of the garbage collector is to transfer the contents of the garbage cans to the back of the garbage truck, trying not to spill the fetid garbage on the road.  Summing up, we can say that the importance of garbage collectors is underestimated by our society, and yet their work is as valuable as the work of teachers and bakers! <br>  - And the last stupid question for today: suppose we have a spherical horse that can walk on its hind legs like a man.  A knight has a execution context tied to the current space-time continuum.  It is necessary to implement a pool of such horses with the ability to unleash military conflicts in the Middle East.  How would you do it for O (n * log (n))? <br>  ‚ÄúHmm ... for starters, I would have given up on value judgments.‚Äù  I would finally realize that there is no pool of spherical horses - and the question itself would lose all meaning.  I myself would become at the same time this horse, and the pool of such horses, and the Middle East.  For Merged With the Eternal, O (n * log (n)) is completely indistinguishable from O (n ^ n). <br>  - Thank you, Sergey.  We will call you back. <br>  - This is really: not for anything.  No need to call back. </div>
