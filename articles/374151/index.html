I warned ... </blockquote><br>  Hello, I am a fullstack developer.  I got interested in development back in 2009, when I was 16. I started gradually and the catalyst for my hobby, oddly enough, became l2.  Ehh, there were wonderful times, a wondrous new world and wonderful chronicles of C6. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  As it happened, I do not remember.  But in the end, I collected, pulled and modified the pattern on ucoz'e, bringing a new clan site into the world.  I remember even being lucky to find the hell of cross-browser and tabular layout.  I was googling then frantically a lot (however, as now), but on the whole the story ended with a happy item because they gave me zaken.  From the knowledge of ucoz'a, HTML and CSS started my way of a web developer. <br><br>  Soon began the preparatory time, exams, admission and the university itself.  I abandoned my hobby until 2015, while my friend and I did not realize starting a techno blog.  Having experience in the development, I volunteered to create a website.  I remember my frustration now, from reading the source of some template, Arabic script.  But with a grief in half, I figured out and within 2 months the site was launched, a domain was purchased and connected to it. <br><br>  I began to confidently code only 1.5-2 years ago.  Like many, it all started with a deeper study of php, after jquery and sql.  I got hooked and started to get more interested in the topic.  This is where it started ... MVC, MVP, SOLID, OOP, BEM etc.  It was incomprehensible, but still interesting.  And besides, ignorance of at least part of this gentleman's set automatically transferred me to the rank of a bydlokoder.  And I did not want such a fate, and I was ashamed of it.  Well, I had to quickly run through the entire required stack.

      I do not know how the rest, but having read and applied the knowledge gained to the test problems, having failed to understand the essence of unnecessary complexity, I continued to write as before.  And only after a while, when the projects became noticeably more complicated, and tracking my dependencies in my code turned into torture, I finally consciously approached the use of the part of the above patterns gradually starting to understand them (although simple projects still hang on the procedure) discouraged).  But still I remained a second-class developer in the eyes of a part of the community.  In short, as I understood, I and my PL lost in everything: in skills, speed, knowledge. <br><br>  From this point on, self-esteem gradually crawled down.  And the reason was not only the initially explosive growth and the gradual slowdown of progress, but also the snobbish, dismissive attitude of some stratum of the community.  And from the once free island, where everyone could become the local architect of their digital castle, programming turned into a race of stacks / practices / codestails. <br><br>  I bydlokoder?  - Yes. <br>  Did it bother me then?  - Yes. <br>  Does it worry now?  - I hope not. <br><br>  In short, I am php-monkey and my work requires significantly less knowledge than programming in C ++.  But you know, I love the web and I want to develop it, no matter how simple it may seem, and no matter how bad I write, because if you don‚Äôt break a code, no matter what, then a reasonable question arises whether you are interested in it at all? <br><br>  And so that they wouldn‚Äôt say there, but thanks to programming and technologies, not only of the highest order, knowledge became accessible to everyone, the communication process became obscenely simple, the corporate world was turned upside down, and states around the world were built inside states.  And deprive yourself of joy to make a small contribution to this magnificence because of the exorbitant ƒåSV of some developers?  Sorry but no. <br><br>  I will not refuse to be an architect, and call myself a programmer.  Indeed, in the end, for this, I need an unprecedentedly small set in the history of mankind: a keyboard, a mouse, inspiration and motivation.  And not a cool technology stack, advanced PL and unshakable belief in its exclusivity. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/374151/">https://habr.com/ru/post/374151/</a></p>
