This is the art of establishing an active and mutually beneficial relationship of the consumer with the consumer and the consumer with the seller.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  That is, ‚Äúword of mouth‚Äù can be ‚Äúturned on‚Äù (naturally occurring ‚Äúword of mouth‚Äù) and ‚Äúmade louder‚Äù (‚Äúword of mouth‚Äù with an amplified signal).  Companies can make every effort to ensure that the consumer is satisfied, they can listen to him, they can help get information from him to his friends as soon as possible, and they can provide good information about the quality of their goods and services to those people whose opinion weight. <br><br>  Word of mouth allows people to share experiences.  This is the most honest form of marketing, built on the natural desire of a person to share information with family, friends and colleagues.  It allows the use of consumer opinion in the interests of the brand.  He also admits that the recall of a dissatisfied customer has the same power as a recall of a satisfied customer. <br><br>  "Word of mouth" can not be faked or fabricated.  Attempts to simulate the word of mouth contradict ethics, provoke a strong backlash, harm the brand and undermine the company's reputation.  The real, sensible marketing of word of mouth does justice to the consumer‚Äôs intelligence and never tries to fool it.  Ethical market participants will not use tactics related to manipulation, deception, espionage or fraud. <br><br>  All marketing techniques of word of mouth are based on the concept of customer satisfaction, as well as on ensuring two-way dialogue and transparency of communications.  You should be able to: <br><br>  <b>Acknowledge the fact that a satisfied consumer is the best recommendation:</b> We work to create enthusiasm for the client, not to promote marketing attitudes. <br>  <b>Giving consumers the right to vote:</b> Provide something worth discussing.  Provide tools to facilitate the exchange of views. <br>  <b>Listen to consumers:</b> engage them in an open, non-censored discussion.  Quickly and honestly answer their questions.  Appreciate the opinion of the consumer, regardless of whether it is positive, negative or neutral. <br>  <b>Make connections within the community:</b> find the right people and keep them in touch with each other.  Promote the formation of new communities.  Participate in existing communities and maintain discussions. <br><br>  How to use word of mouth to your advantage: <br><ul><li>  Inform your employees about your products, goals and strategies; </li><li>  Involve employees in decision making and discussion;  make the product excite them to the same extent as you yourself; </li><li>  Inform consumers about your products and services; </li><li>  Highlight people who are most willing to share their opinions; </li><li>  Provide tools to facilitate the exchange of information; </li><li>  Track exactly how, where and when the exchange of opinions takes place; </li><li>  Be able to listen to different points of view and respond to both your supporters and opponents, and those who hold a neutral position. </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/75148/">https://habr.com/ru/post/75148/</a></p>
