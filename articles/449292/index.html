    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yp/p0/jy/ypp0jyifcsb5avujqyvo7usm0qa.jpeg"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Over the years, we have considered quite a few so-called ‚Äúsmart pens‚Äù <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/medgadgets/blog/412387/">from 10‚Äì11 thousand</a> to <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/medgadgets/blog/419119/">50 thousand rubles</a> .  We listened to a lot of critics and even tried to reflect it somehow: <br><br><blockquote>  Read our: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/medgadgets/blog/419211/">A few words in defense of smart pens</a> </blockquote><br>  Nevertheless, to this day the category remains quite controversial from the point of view of applicability in everyday life, despite the participation of large brands in it. <br><br>  Problem points remain design and price.  No one seems to argue that a pen as a writing accessory can (and should) be expensive.  Pop "Parker" as a business gift is from 10-15 thousand.  Montblanc, where the whole collection of feathers with gold tips, also can not be cheap. <br><br>  But for some reason, it is customary to scold pen-gadgets.  Probably because the design of such products is not ‚Äúsophisticated‚Äù from the point of view of the average user.  Although‚Ä¶ <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/3m/r0/c0/3mr0c0tysx1fizawzzug7xugev0.png"><br><br>  Take, for example, the most unpretentious "Montegrappu", a brand with a world name and a leading manufacturer of pens.  And here you sit under a magnifying glass, and what is there for something like 13 thousand rubles? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/te/xh/qk/texhqktyaawmeil9sap90kqruwq.gif"><br><br>  At the same time, from the point of view of universality, it, of course, loses even more: after all, smart recording pens retain, transmit, allow to edit them.  Therefore, when users say, why should it be, probably, it must be assumed that they do not use ordinary pens - otherwise, what is the question? <br><br>  Of course, there is a category of users that is convenient to write with three-ruble plastic handles: as a rule, no persuasion does not work here, and they don‚Äôt make sense.  But we believe this: if a person is ready to consider an accessory worth about 10 thousand for himself, then why not show him a smart pen.  A narrow audience, of course, understand. <br><br>  It is also narrow, and then, that the category of smart pens itself is without category.  You can't write them down in ordinary ones, in ‚Äúgeek-pens‚Äù - probably, also only in part.  Under the "geek handles" would rather understand something like FidgetPen from <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/medgadgets/blog/420007/">Allocacoc</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wv/hn/ni/wvhnnikx5k-mrikovabkw3atgeo.gif"><br><br>  Or the eternal Pininfarina models: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/f4/yc/eo/f4yceoetvvzgjvc-hi4y0hpsj-0.jpeg"><br><br>  But, again, it is necessary to refer to a not quite relevant link with the forecast that the niche is growing, developing and <a href="https://www.variantmarketresearch.com/report-categories/semiconductor-electronics/digital-pen-market">plans to reach a</a> volume of $ 4.260 million with the main turnover in the West. <br><br>  But this again, all the lyrics and reasoning, and we still count the big brands on our fingers: Neo.Lab, Livescribe, Equill, Montblanc and, perhaps, everything.  In this sense, of course, it is interesting to see what kind of competition and what exactly makes up the <a href="https://medgadgets.ru/shop/mt6081.html%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dmt6081%26utm_campaign%3Dmt6081">model MT6081</a> .  We will not directly compare anyone with anyone, but just tell you what is so interesting. <br><br>  All smart pens can be divided into two broad categories: <br><br><table border="1" cellpadding="2"><tbody><tr><td>  <b>One big category</b> </td><td>  <b>Second big category</b> </td></tr><tr><td>  With built-in scanner </td><td>  With remote scanner </td></tr></tbody></table><br>  No matter how comical and inappropriate this table would look, everything is really like this: it is exhaustive.  Others are already being solved at the level of software and design.  The main difference is how much gadgets you will have in the end. <br><br>  Pens with a built-in scanner (these include Neo.Lab, Livescribe), as a rule, are paired with proprietary markup.  That is, they <b>must</b> either purchase or print out strictly special sheets. <br><br>  Pens, where a portable scanner, in this sense is more profitable: the sheets can be used any.  But here you get <b>two gadgets</b> that need to be charged: the pen itself, and the base, which receives the signal.  At some periphery, Wacom remains (and Montblanc, inside which is the same Wacom), but there are still two gadgets structurally, however, one of which does not need to be charged. <br><br>  The MT6081 handle is a handle <b>from the second large category</b> .  There are both pluses and minuses in this, but it will definitely appeal to those who usually remain indignant that you need to buy more special notebooks, spend extra money, deception, deception.  There is no deception: you can write on any sheets! <br><br>  Let's celebrate this versatility as the first positive factor. <br><br>  In order for the save functions to work, it is enough to secure the base on top of the sheet and turn it on. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wc/po/x-/wcpox-uj2j9efvqgcln_f5njoke.jpeg"><br><br>  It turns on simply: with a single button.  From the point of view of fastening, such a base is quite reliable and works on the ‚Äúclothespin‚Äù principle.  In front of her is a scanner that reads information from the sheet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-h/wi/jd/-hwijdar4ex5tizhtd9vgti7u7i.jpeg"><br><br>  The numbers on the panel are the ordinal number of the page. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0q/io/ia/0qioia4yrep8lqs1f63nt3nsfva.jpeg"><br><br>  If you are working offline, this is a good way not to get confused.  To make the pen understand that this work with the current page is finished, you need to click on the button.  The page is thereby stored in memory, and you can move on to the following material. <br><br>  Here, the plus is that you can use one sheet for different note pages: as soon as you click on the button, the same sheet in the eyes of the scanner is a new one.  Perfect for short notes. <br><br>  <b>Transfer data to computer</b> <br><br>  Many smart pens are ‚Äúsharpened‚Äù for working with mobile applications, and in this sense, the MT6081 has some advantage, because it is optimized <b>only</b> for work with a PC.  In my memory, many complained, they say, how is it that I do not need notes in the smartphone - I need to import into the PC.  Well, please.  Can be written as a second plus. <br><br>  Here, of course, there are a couple of questions about ‚Äúbusiness application‚Äù: most modern executives are working on a Mac, while this model is ‚Äúfriendly‚Äù with Windows only, but given the general popularity of the system, there is a logic to this. <br><br>  There are two main programs for working with a pen: <br><br><ul><li>  Note Manager </li><li>  Photo Sketcher </li></ul><br>  The main purpose of the first program is to import notes from a pen.  To do this, you need to connect the base to the computer, open the program and click on the exchange icon. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jq/if/gq/jqifgqzymchewk95artgcdhj3pu.jpeg"><br><br>  The second application is for working with photos.  In fact, with his help, you can do something like author cards or draw a mustache to someone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bo/9a/vi/bo9aviboavtxshsdo2jiymr4vji.jpeg"><br><br>  Its entertaining and creative value is doubtful to me.  In general, to be honest, it seems to me that already in its current form: importing handwritten notes into the PC‚Äôs memory is absolutely sufficient functionality for this device. <br><br>  <b>Text recognition, import to Word</b> <br><br>  The second most important possibility is to send the note immediately to the MyScript recognizer.  Included with the handle is the key to the program.  All is recognized quite well, if the handwriting at least approximately resembles Russian letters.  The first pancake, of course, came out in a lump ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qn/pf/fi/qnpffibc5r9qjbkcloamwemah1a.jpeg"><br><br>  But with minimal effort, everything was more or less readable: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/6g/w0/p7/6gw0p7jio7nx5emtcfak9wr1udq.jpeg"><br><br>  To import into MyScript, you need to press the letter ‚Äúa‚Äù on the side panel: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cr/4m/n1/cr4mn1w2mykkiooweej3qh9mzty.jpeg"><br><br>  From this program, the text is imported into Word with one button for further work.  In general, journalists, representatives of creative specialties, writers - this would be very helpful.  Wrote - recognized - edited where it is bad, and printed. <br><br>  When working with a pen, these possibilities are more than enough.  I do not know, again, whether such a gadget is suitable for artists.  The problem that all smart pens have is still there: MT6081, unfortunately, does not recognize pressure, does not see "light" lines. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1z/ye/fc/1zyefckckhjhacw8y3w-uekjxwa.jpeg"><br><br>  From my humble experience, I can say for sure that for some, especially for those who exactly draws, this can become an obstacle. <br><br>  <b>Real time operation</b> <br><br>  Objectively speaking, this does not make much sense in this case, but the pen can do it.  With a wired connection of the base to the computer, you can see the display of your notes in real time. <br><br>  How convenient is it: a sheet on the table, a monitor in front of your eyes, where to look, how to follow, draw or write blindly?  In general, there are questions to this opportunity, and for me it turned out to be unclaimed. <br><br>  The only thing that can be used is working with a pen as a mouse.  With direct connection to a PC, pressing the button changes the pen's operation mode.  I do not use the mouse for 9 years, so I can not appreciate the convenience. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/2u/iu/oa/2uiuoapis8q7x1chkq5sniqcmpu.jpeg"><br><br>  There is nothing to dirty and scratch: in the mouse mode you can remove the rod.  There is even a button on the case - click. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/n0/e6/wo/n0e6wowf1zuiubdejkdiaikeuy0.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>Appearance</b> <br><br>  Since we showed her so closely, we need to say a few words about how she looks.  And here it is slightly, in my opinion, loses in the niche, if you remove the cap. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/my/w-/ab/myw-abyrf0vkxbdn9ywekyjtftw.jpeg"><br><br>  At work, this does not affect, you keep such a pen anyway higher.  And, by the way, here I must say that in her hand she sits flawlessly.  But such a design tip is very much issued by the gadget. <br><br>  I believe that the principle of "cutting out" she has a similar Montblanc pen: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/g8/dp/fc/g8dpfcorevyuile9vuiibqliha8.jpeg"><br><br>  That is, this form of the lower part is due to the presence of electronics there.  But visually this is not the best solution in the classroom. <br><br>  Appearance in the cap - very decent, I can even say that it is prestigious. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cc/za/ym/cczayms2ef_bfjsxcg_30phnz_i.jpeg"><br><br>  The strict design with the metal case, executed in uniform style.  The material is pleasant and does not cause any negative emotions.  With the dimensions here, too, everything is in order: it is no more and no less than ordinary pens.  Everything fits into the dimensions of the IPhone 7 Plus with a small case. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mo/w8/cu/mow8cuvufhv6pyibijbs20-oyba.jpeg"><br><br>  The handle is not round.  On one side - Mini USB connector for charging.  The same connector on the host base. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/h5/sy/gk/h5sygk1-ds1zfw5qtnlorx9cj1k.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>Let's summarize</b> <br><br>  <b>In terms of convenience.</b>  MT6081 is a simple and understandable gadget, and given that the ‚ÄúDjadget‚Äù always completes the instruction manual in Russian, no problems have arisen at any stage.  There are no complicated connections, synchronizations, settings.  Enough for both gadgets to be charged.  Turned on the base - you work.  It sits comfortably in your hand, writing comfortably. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/e9/tf/1r/e9tf1rbiykxs8xuhfnv0ur827zy.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>Pen as a gadget.</b>  There are advantages due to the structure: it is, of course, the possibility of using any sheets, notebooks, notebooks, etc. Also, such a pen may be of interest to those who lacked imports to the PC.  The connection features slightly dictated the shape of the tip, but how critical it is is a matter of taste. <br><br>  <b>The pen is like a pen.</b>  Ordinary rods, writes like an ordinary pen.  A weak point for illustrators, sketchers can be non-recognition of pressure.  There is no such problem for working with text. <br><br>  <b>Application functionality.</b>  In my opinion, this pen is primarily intended for those who write a lot by hand.  From this point of view, the functionality here is exhaustive: save and recognize.  Aesthetic features of applications will not be considered in this case. <br><br>  In general, if you look, the model MT6081 still stands out against the background of exclusively (or semi-) mobile solutions.  With all the necessary basic functionality that you expect from the handles of this category, it can win.  Moreover, also in price competition, if you <a href="https://medgadgets.ru/shop/mt6081.html%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dmt6081%26utm_campaign%3Dmt6081">use a coupon for a 20% discount</a> - <b>20MT6081</b> , which will be valid until the end of the week. <br><br>  Thank you all for your attention! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/449292/">https://habr.com/ru/post/449292/</a></p>
