I think for the introduction of words is more than enough, it's time to move on to the meaning. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Meaning: </h4><br><br>  The service, by design, aggregates user information from various sources, be it flickr, evernote, or something else, and is able to present this information on the timeline and allow sorting in a convenient way for the user (that is, several of them are available - which is convenient - and sorts ).  What is the profit you ask - ok, let's talk about goals.

    <h4>  Goals: </h4><br><br>  I had encountered such a problem more than once that let's say I wanted to do something yesterday (that week, that very Friday, 23rd day etc), I was in tune, had thoughts, but there was no time, but now it is there, but the mood is lost , and the thoughts are already partly too.  For me personally, the mood as such is created by several factors, namely the music that I listen to, photo, video materials and articles that I watch.  Of course, this is by no means a complete list, but perhaps these are practically the most important factors.  Therefore, in order to reproduce the necessary attitude, it is necessary to repeat everything (or part) of what was being heard, read, etc. on the required day.  And, oh, a miracle, we finally got through the shreds of words to the true meaning - it was for this that I conceived the service.  We go, look for the right day and see, let's say, ‚Äúhistory‚Äù with the ability to view, listen, etc.  As for me - just a gift of some kind. <br><br>  This is one rather private use case, but the second example will be much more generalized: <br><br>  Suppose you had a corporate party (party, alumni meeting, friendly get-togethers, think about it yourself) and you want to tell someone about it, but not just show photos / videos, but also convey the atmosphere - here the service is able to add music files and group This is all in a convenient way. <br><br><h4>  Instead of an afterword: </h4><br><br>  I understand perfectly well that such functionality has long been implemented in each individual service, but the goal is to aggregate all the information in one place and a user-friendly view of the complex. <br><br>  ZY  Well, as always, I welcome constructive criticism, suggestions and suggestions in the comments. <br><br>  UPD: This is not a finished project, not even a project in its infancy - this is just an idea, but maybe it will grow into something more, it depends largely on your feedback.  Thanks for attention. <br><br>  UPD2: For now I‚Äôve put it on this blog, who have ideas on where it would look better - again, please, in the comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/86081/">https://habr.com/ru/post/86081/</a></p>
