  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Cheers, comrades! I blocked the whole world!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I notice that lately there is not enough privacy - information is attacking us from all sides, and more often we have not expected or needed it.  I will not even write about social networks and various forums, publicity has always been and will be above privacy.  Recently, however, more and more, even in such a personal place as mail, we see that privacy is bursting at the seams. <br><br>  I will no longer write here about various advertisements, offers, promotions and other messages that we receive daily web mail on your page.  But constantly receiving various letters that I don‚Äôt want to receive at all - this is already too much!  I want to have mail and communicate only with those who are close to me and with whom it is interesting or necessary for me to communicate, and the rest, as they say "into the forest." <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  And how can I do this?  It turns out on <a href="https://www.gypost.com/">gYpost.com</a> all this is just plain ugly.  Simply select the contact ‚ÄúUnknown Correspondence‚Äù and from the contact card in the Edit menu select the item ‚ÄúBlock contact‚Äù and ... and that's it.  Now you are completely cut off from the outside world!  Now we can say with confidence: <b>I have blocked the whole world!</b>  As the saying goes, ‚Äúboth silence and only dead ones with braids are standing‚Äù (only dead ones with braids you will not see in the mail of course, but if anyone thinks that this is our defect, please tell us about it, smile).

      <br>
      And by the way, one moment - none of those who will send me letters will know that their mail does not come to me (only quietly, I don‚Äôt want all the spammers to know about this, they might be offended) <br><br>  Wow class!  Now in the mail I and only I!  So ... stop!  And how can I get mail from my friends, acquaintances, relatives, dogs (no, I haven‚Äôt gotten mail to the dog ... but it's a good idea), colleagues, party members ... and from the chef in the end! <br><br>  Turning on gYpost.com is also very easy.  It is enough to create a contact (or several contacts) and indicate in it (or in them) the email addresses of all the people interested in me with whom I want to communicate and ... and the mail to these contacts will come without any blocking.  Hurray comrades!  I have achieved my goal - I have organized my own small, but dear to me and truly personal world, without thousands of unnecessary letters to me! <br><br>  PS Please do not strictly judge the style of writing, it is, if I may say so, "attempt to write."  I would very much like to hear your constructive views on the possibilities described above, as well as on the style of providing this information.  I would be grateful for both positive and negative comments, but I very much ask you for specific and concrete cases. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/131403/">https://habr.com/ru/post/131403/</a></p>
