  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Conference reports ByNet2.0</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  That was the ByNet2.0 conference in Minsk. <br>  We describe the sequence of events of the conference.  It will not be an analysis of events (it will come later), but simply a listing of the list of events that were liked or, on the contrary, depressed.  I have to say that the conference was a success :) <br><br><h2>  Intro </h2><br>  The conference was held on June 19 in the IBB center (Minsk, Pravda newspaper avenue, 11). <br>  More than 350 people came (hollow hall), the audience waited began.  Of course, until the end, and the conference dragged on until 21 o'clock (this is without Tut.by Beer Party 2.0) 60 people ‚Äúreached‚Äù, but this is not bad either.  Organized a conference <a href="http://art23.livejournal.com/">Artem Gerasimovich</a> , Alexander Denisova (http://seobaby.net) <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Welcome and first reports </h2><br>  As usual, microphones did not work well, the crowd of listeners had not yet learned to keep silence, so the greeting (especially the statements about ‚ÄúHigh Technologies Park‚Äù) was heard, and, probably, was not even noticed.  Everything just started. <br>  ‚ÄúThe new life of the author.  Understanding the web 2.0 "Artem Gerasimovich (if you have not forgotten - the organizer) in many ways set the tone for the entire conference.  They say that it has become easier for authors to publish, the emergence and development of blogs, websites have become more ‚Äúfriendly‚Äù and this is Web2.0.  Many did not agree with the controversial opinion of the rapporteur and this was reflected in subsequent reports.

      ‚ÄúYour personal web‚Äù by Alexandra Denisova largely set the theme web2.0 as a blogging one.  A review of current technologies was conducted.  The author, of course, did not forget to mention the widgets, but did not reveal the topic as <a href="http://www.seobaby.net/archives/117">promised</a> earlier;) <br><br>  The report ‚ÄúMashups: how to integrate data without writing a single line of code‚Äù (Alexey Khizhnyak, Apatar Open Source Data Integration) narrated, of course, about mashaps.  The speaker quickly and thoroughly (sometimes amusingly and with humor) explained, in fact, what it is and what it is eaten with.  Listeners listened to the product description from Apatar-Apatar Project.  The product is promising and requires promotion, so the speaker at the end of the report, said: "If journalists have questions, come up."  A bold and correct move;). <br><br>  The corporate blogosphere (Anna Rokina, Netmind) continued the stubborn conviction of listeners that web2.0 is just blogs.  Although a couple of good topics to think about, the speaker reported.  Therefore, I would not be surprised if, in the future, many companies start a corporate blog. <br><br>  Many thanks to Alexey Andreev, aka Lech, (Webplanet, <a href="http://webplanet.ru/">webplanet.ru</a> ) for the report ‚ÄúTemporary communities: organization and business‚Äù.  The report started with the criticism of ‚Äúsnickering‚Äù Moscow and disagreement with the report ‚ÄúNew life of the author‚Äù by Artem Gerasimenko.  ‚ÄúAll this was before, nothing has changed,‚Äù said Lech.  The report was capacious and interesting, it makes no sense to retell it in a nutshell, waiting for the publication of materials :) I will say one thing was a lot of life examples and references to real projects, so for the first time I looked at <a href="http://eva.ru/">eva.ru</a> and I am immensely pleased. <br><br>  The report "Modern Search" by Anton Shurkus (Quintura) told about an excellent search engine.  The system is based on intelligent search, go to the official website <a href="http://quintura.com/">quintura.com</a> and see. <br>  I think many people liked the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa search engine and its implementation (there was a small demonstration).  Of course, webmasters (including me) were extremely curious to hear about the affiliate program, which we immediately decided to clarify. <br><br>  The optimizers did not wait for the report ‚ÄúRSS: Present and Future‚Äù (Oleg Basha, Artem Kashekhlebov, Olevarty), which was canceled.  Very sorry. <br><br>  The podcast report (Artem Rosnovsky, video broadcast) was also canceled.  Sorry too. <br><br><h2>  Fire from mobiles, viruses, marketing, three zeros and content providers </h2><br><br>  But about this report "Mobile 2.0" (Alexander Levitsky) from the words of the author called - Mobile 2.0.  You can not tell in one paragraph, it is best if someone provides a video, maybe itv.by?  Do this, please, and we will learn everything about Masha, her personal problems and the author.  However, there was also a benefit from the report, we learned about the existence of mobile phones and what functions they have, raised the mood. <br><br>  The next report was ‚ÄúMobile Communities‚Äù ( <a href="http://alovak.livejournal.com/">Pavel Gabriel</a> , head of Wap.by).  He told in general about the problems of mobile communities in Belarus and wap.by separately.  The speech was somewhat pessimistic and was not very encouraging, so I would rename the report ‚ÄúLack of Mobile Communities‚Äù.  However, the problems were announced. <br><br>  But the guys from cream.by provided the opposite with full optimism about the work - ‚ÄúTendencies of social network development‚Äù (Vasily Omelyanenko, <a href="http://dest.by/">DesignStation</a> , Artem Pugachev, Cream.by).  Their report was built on the fact that everything is OK, we‚Äôll not buy Google.  They told about the development of their portal, promised him a bright future and all that;).  Well done, well done, but kitsch (IMHO) :) <br><br>  Marketing 2.0 ( <a href="http://baderko.moikrug.ru/">Alexander Baderko</a> , Snegmedia).  Awesome report showing marketing problems (or rather lack thereof) in web2.0 projects.  We are waiting for materials, with this you need to read. <br><br>  The pathos performance of <a href="http://itv.by/">itv.by</a> ‚ÄúNew Style of Media <a href="http://itv.by/">Consumption</a> ‚Äù ( <a href="http://tlashuk.moikrug.ru/">Tatiana Lashuk</a> , itv.by) about the Belarusian Internet TV was remembered by many.  But they have a right to this - the project is of high quality, a lot of work has been done (there is still much more to do;)).  Tatiana bravely answered all the questions, which is good news. <br><br>  The presentation by Yana Bazevich ‚ÄúTrends in the development of remote banking services in Belarus‚Äù was only interesting, but also promising (or rather, they promised a lot, even support for the WMZ exchange).  Thank God, Transit Bank decided to take on these problems until the remote banking.  On the questions, it turned out that people will certainly be able to pay for Internet services, but it‚Äôs impossible to pay for work from one individual to another on the Internet as before (freelancers do not expect; () <br><br>  The report "Web Design 2.0" ( <a href="http://www.lepshey.ru/">Mikhail Lepshey, Lepshey Art Direction &amp; Design</a> ) noted the main cliches for building web2.0 web sites.  What caused the sharp criticism from Alexei Andreev (crit tags: a children's toy, everything_this already, was a simplified design for dull Americans).  I liked the extraordinary question from an elderly uncle about porn sites and whether there are any of them in the style of web2.0 :) <br><br>  The Belarusian Blog - BYjournal Service ( <a href="http://alis.moikrug.ru/">Andrey Lis</a> , <a href="http://byjournal.com/">byjournal</a> ) was read without a speaker Artem Gerasimovich.  The project is a qualitative modification of WordPress, so I advise you to visit this portal.  They read the report extremely succinctly, because time was already short, they slapped the author and ‚Äúran‚Äù further <br><br>  The report "Website promotion in the context of web 2.0" ( <a href="http://blog.ru-content.net/">Sergey Nazaruk</a> , head of the studio Ru-content).  Were considered as traditional methods of promotion, as well as non-traditional.  The speaker tried to cover and convey the maximum number of ways to optimize, it would be nice if he also spoke about viral marketing, but he decided not to focus.  We are waiting for materials. <br><br>  The report ‚ÄúViral Marketing‚Äù by <a href="http://www.ipr.by/ru/readings/2006/report_5.html">Kirill Voloshin</a> pleased with the abundance of commercials.  No less pleased with the complete disregard of Artem Gerasimovich‚Äôs requests to finish the report as soon as possible.  I haven‚Äôt let anyone tell me yet :) <br><br>  And of course (How did I forget?) There was a report from guru <a href="http://blog.redgraphic.ru/os/">Sergey Osipov</a> (Red Graphics) ‚ÄúMonetization of content: the way of samurai‚Äù.  An encouraging video presentation that it would be time for us (the developers) to earn money by selling mobile content (the point is to take this bread away from network providers).  Yes, it's time to start earning, gentlemen content providers, as it has long been done in Russia <br><br>  The speech of Fyodor Korolenko ( <a href="http://www.akavita.com/">Akavita</a> ) cannot be called differently as ‚ÄúWeb 3.0‚Äù.  Having boldly and clearly named our problems (Belarusian website builders), the main problems are: no money, no visitors, no services, concluded that it would be difficult for us to live :) But we believe that there will be a holiday in our street, right ?;) <br><br><h2>  Technical part of the reports </h2><br>  Technical reports were held in a situation of austerity, so the speakers squeezed, hurried and even, sometimes, got confused.  Therefore, I will try to tell about these reports more (maybe even more speakers themselves) <br><br>  The report on "Features of the development of high-loaded Internet projects" from Rambler itself (represented by Maxim Gurets, lead developer) was also presented in the form of video broadcasting.  Accordingly, there were problems with communication, but this is also not scary.  The speaker actually told the audience about the construction of the FrontEnd - BackEnd system, and listened to the audience gratefully.  After a slight hitch with disconnects, questions were asked and answers were received.  Video broadcasting is over. <br><br>  I liked the guys <a href="http://ymazanik.moikrug.ru/">Yuri Mazanik</a> (Epam Systems) and <a href="http://blogs.gotdotnet.ru/personal/dr.gigabit/">Andrey Voronovich</a> (.NET Minsk User Group) with the report on the topic ‚ÄúInfrastructure support for web 2.0 projects‚Äù.  A well-reasoned and promising report about manna from heaven, which sprinkled on programmers under the 3 conditions: they use <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2008/default.mspx">Windows Server Longhorn</a> , <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/07/03/IIS7/default.aspx%3Floc%3Dru">IIS 7.0</a> and Cash, lots and lots of Cash (what they actually admitted).  In principle, I was pleased with the promise to rebuild the architecture of IIS and Microsoft‚Äôs entry into the enterprise-level solutions market (again, they did not apply to state this).  It is noteworthy that in situations not related to the report, the speakers quietly used the services of free Google and Mozilla Firefox.  But it is so, the details. <br><br>  I liked the report ‚ÄúInterfaces of the new web‚Äù ( <a href="http://yuri.shilyaev.com/">Yuri Shilyaev</a> , Minsk, <a href="http://www.jvetrau.com/">Yuri Vetrov</a> , St. Petersburg, Artics Internet Solutions).  True to say, the beginning was successfully missed by me, so when I entered, I saw the following picture: smiling preachers on the stage, a psychedelic video on the screen, silence in the hall.  Pure sermon, especially if you remember the view of Yuri Shilyaeva;).  Yuri Vetrov was particularly noted on the report with the following expressions: ‚Äúyes, this is a great thing,‚Äù ‚Äúyes, this thing would be super,‚Äù ‚Äúthat's such a thing.‚Äù  However, some of the thoughts they reported.  For example, it was announced that desktop applications would be combined with web applications.  Although, I do not agree (web-swallow the desktop).  But this is their point of view. <br><br>  "Aja framework for PHP".  Probably was the most expected PHP programmers report.  It turned out that Peter Samoilov (lead programmer of the Fifth Terminal LLC) actually presented the framework scheme, but his development, but almost done;) In principle, the framework as a framework, figs with it.  But programmers were offended and asked questions like "why this framework was created at all", "and how is it better", or here is such a brilliant question: "what type of file uploading do you support?"  So, right behind the stand, the speaker and his company got more cuffs than during the debugging of the framework itself (IMHO). <br><br>  A good report on the topic ‚ÄúWeb standards of the new generation‚Äù (Pavel Lovtsevich ( <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/zigzag/" class="user_link">Zigzag</a> ), LOVATA Group) was terribly compressed, in the conditions of time saving.  And it was in the form: I will read you everything here quickly, and you really try to understand everything.  Although a couple of these figures in the report, it would be worth remembering the audience.  Memories of the report are only positive. <br><br>  We could have an excellent report on ‚ÄúSecurity in Web 2.0‚Äù by Konstantin Mulyarchik, but he was in such a hurry to save our total time that he practically crumpled up his report before the review: how to protect the communication channel in a web2.0 client-server application , announcing the list of the most popular errors, the story about the Cross-site scripting attacks in AJAX.  If you're interested, check out the next article, <a href="http://www.inattack.ru/news/1100.html">Ten Web 2.0 vulnerabilities</a> , it will help a lot. <br><br>  Probably Yevgeny Palchevsky aka James (Belarusian PHP Group, php.by) made the best report among the ‚Äúyoung‚Äù speakers.  The topic of the report was ‚ÄúReview of popular JavaScript Frameworks‚Äù, and in the light of the growing popularity of this language, it was particularly interesting for listeners (according to information ‚Äúby eye‚Äù among the rest there were about 80% of programmers).  The following JS frameworks are described: DoJo, Prototype / Script.aculo.us, jQuery.  Last, all, as always struck, many thought.  Then I even asked a couple of questions, so for decency.  And "ran" to the following reports. <br><br>  And here is the final conference.  About 60 people were left in the hall, Microsoft Ukraine, Developer Evangelist, Sergey Baydachny spoke on "Silver LIght: New Technologies for Web Applications Development".  However, his report was already held at the last conference. <br>  <a href="http://it.tut.by/news/98612.html">Belarusian Hosting</a> .  However, the remaining audience had no less interest in the report.  About 40 minutes of broadcasting about the benefits that fall on the shoulders of developers (the example with the egg was especially significant), nevertheless, they did not convince the latter.  Therefore, the designated asked all sorts of tricky questions, did not believe, frowned and knocked his feet on the floor.  In general, Sergei began to raise his voice, and listeners to slide to the flame;).  It is worth noting that this time Microsoft got it for: the expensive cost of products and the closed code, and than this, in fact, is better than Flash.  As you can see in the claims, almost no word on Silver Light (mentioned briefly as a reason);).  Therefore, Sergey made Solomon‚Äôs decision: I don‚Äôt know the Flash, but let's give up all the remaining questions on beer;) <br>  By the way, to the question ‚ÄúAre there any designers among us‚Äù, sounded at the end of the report, only one hand was raised :), although I could not notice. <br><br><br><h2>  Evening or as tut.by did his dirty work </h2><br>  The supplied beer had an effect on the empty stomachs of the conference visitors, like valerian on cats.  Then there was the last word of Artem Gerasimovich, which was supported by everyone for beer.  Shouted, demanded to repeat. <br>  As a result, everyone became happy-blessed and, at the suggestion of Alexandra Denisova (one of the conference organizers, <a href="http://seobaby.net/">seobaby.net</a> ), went hmm ... literally: "And send, to the tavern!".  What we actually did;) It is indecent and dishonest to tell further about the rest;) Ask yourself everything :-p <br><br><br>  Original <a href="http://gisma.livejournal.com/79519.html">http://gisma.livejournal.com/79519.html#cutid1</a> <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/11046/">https://habr.com/ru/post/11046/</a></p>
