  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Servicing external customers in ITSM 365</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  What is the difference between IT systems designed for internal IT services from IT systems for outsourcers and other external companies that provide support and IT services?  An IT service usually has an informal trust relationship with the customer.  As a result, the IT service can "forgive" and some non-compliance with the quality of IT services and even serious errors.  But the IT service has the ability to engage in automation "in depth", using the full ITIL processes and the functionality of the Service Desk solutions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6f3/cb7/3aa/6f3cb73aa43f42ce20984e97a8110326.png"><br><br>  An IT outsourcing company works with at least 2-3 different clients, providing each with their own sets of services and possibly their own SLAs.  A support service employee, accepting a request from a client, must know which services and with which parameters are provided to this client, whether additional coordination of work and budgets is required, etc.  At the same time, the external IT company on the client‚Äôs site manages only the basic ITIL processes, such as managing incidents, problems, changes, etc.  Everything else requires a much greater maturity of the relationship between IT and business.  As a result, IT companies use fairly limited HelpDesk solution functionality. <br>  What does a small IT company want to get from HelpDesk solutions? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><ul><li>  Ticket system is a tool that allows you to create, coordinate and take into account service requests from customers. </li><li>  The ability to quickly (and preferably free of charge) connect to the system all its customers and customers. </li><li>  Facilities that allow you to customize for each client a set of services and conditions of service. </li><li>  Some analogue of the CRM-system: client profile, information on employees of the client‚Äôs company. </li><li>  Reporting on requests in the context of customers, by employees. </li><li>  And, of course, the small cost of the entire solution. </li></ul><br>  In the new ITSM 365 release, all of this is implemented, and the redesigned interface of the solution and an improved navigation system will allow you to quickly understand how it all works.

      <strong>Supported</strong> <strong>ITIL</strong> <strong>Processes</strong> <br><ul><li>  Incident and service request management. </li><li>  Problem management. </li><li>  Change management. </li><li>  Management of internal tasks and assignments. </li><li>  Configuration management and IT assets. </li><li>  Service Management (SLM) and Service Delivery Levels (SLA). </li><li>  Management of the catalog and portfolio of services. </li><li>  Knowledge management. </li><li>  Accounting labor IT staff. </li></ul><br>  <strong>Coordination</strong> <br>  IT services have an important advantage over most IT companies - the IT budget.  IT service is much freer can spend money on the necessary components and consumables in the work.  In any case, the business will pay for all the work done in the form of employee salaries, and all other expenses, too.  Of course, sometimes the IT service also needs to agree on the scope and cost of the work, especially if it assumes quite significant costs for the company. <br><br>  For an IT outsourcing company, any work done beyond what is written into the contract with the client is a gift to the client.  The chances that the work will be paid in fact are quite small. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/434/0cf/0dd/4340cf0dd5f28a1c336936f21660830f.png"><br><br>  In the new release of <a href="http://itsm365.ru/lp/">ITSM365,</a> the reconciliation process can be extended to any actions on customer requests.  This could be a service request, change request, incident, arrival time at the client, any additional work, etc.  Up to the point that you can negotiate a new contract with the end user.  In order to participate in the coordination of users do not need any additional licenses.  He can respond to the request in his personal account.  In accordance with the recommendations of ITIL, a ‚Äúcoordinating committee‚Äù of several people may be created. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/656/42c/68c/65642c68c7397ae86fd25e7c377c5d85.png"><br><br>  Thus, any amount of work can be coordinated with the client without long correspondence.  All the customer needs is to click the ‚ÄúI agree‚Äù button in your personal account and, possibly, to leave a comment.  It remains only to add clauses to the contract that the agreement obtained in this way is considered legally significant.  Exactly, such a coordination mechanism will simplify the life of IT services, because  for them, the very fact of receiving approval for certain actions is much more important than the form in which this approval was obtained. <br><br>  In the agreement, you can connect a variety of contractors: contractors, service providers, consultants, etc.  All necessary participants of various processes and projects can be opened to access ITSM365 and given a personal user account. <br><br>  <strong>User account</strong> <br>  <a href="http://itsm365.ru/lp/">ITSM365</a> on all tariffs offers a free personalized portal for business users.  The portal provides the ability to leave requests for incidents and service requests, as well as the ability to monitor their implementation by the Service Desk.  Within the portal, mechanisms were implemented to automate approvals at the level of managers and employees of the company.  The portal also integrates the Knowledge Base, which will be able to provide answers to many typical user questions and allow them to independently cope with problems.  It should be noted that before the Knowledge Base becomes useful, it is necessary to fill it with useful tips. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/834/e85/69f/834e8569fe0cf81adbf2dcd24c140173.png"><br><br>  What a client sees when he enters his free personal account: <br><ul><li>  Simple and intuitive interface, which has no specific IT terms </li><li>  Your applications </li><li>  Your profile </li><li>  Your agreement </li><li>  Information on their contracts and services </li><li>  Background information and instructions </li></ul><br>  Each client has its own set.  On all tariff plans, except the initial one, it is possible to customize and customize the interface. <br><br>  Adding users to the system is completely free and does not require the purchase of any licenses.  In ITSM365, only the workplaces of operators of the Service Desk are licensed. <br><br>  A personal account can be created not only for employees of the client‚Äôs company, but also for various service providers, contractors, consultants and other contractors.  At the same time, Service Desk operators, receiving requests from such users, will see what kind of services the company provides to them. <br><br>  We will tell you more about the new release of ITSM365 at the webinar: ‚Äú <a href="http://itsm365.ru/lp/webinar-registration.html">ITSM 365 has become‚Äú smarter ‚Äùand automates servicing external clients</a> .‚Äù </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/225689/">https://habr.com/ru/post/225689/</a></p>
