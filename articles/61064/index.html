The speakers were not only good professionals in their field, but also born speakers. <br><br>  During the conference, a round table was held on the topic: "Features of attracting investment in gaming projects," where Alexey (darkGengeral) - Head of Unique Games, Denis Dovgopoli - entrepreneur and investor, Andrey Lvov - CEO of Dark Joker Games, Tatyana Zolotareva shared their experiences - Director of Art4Art Entertainment.

      Anyone who wanted to announce their company or themselves, share their experience and make new business acquaintances - achieved their goal at this conference, which is what we wanted. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>And now about the conference:</b> <br><br>  Registration at the reception, a brief overview of the remnants of the exhibition "Internet Ukraine 2009" and moving to the very "International Conference of developers of online games in Ukraine" - in a small conference room with signs of an advertising nature and a decent amount of people.  Further, the opening speech from the organizers of the event - Tatiana Zolotareva and Viktor Andriychuk from Art4Art Entertaiment with a smooth transition directly to the reports.  The most important details of these are lower in the course. <br><br>  <b>‚ÄúCommunity online, investment attraction, local currency of games‚Äù</b> <br><br>  The first to take the floor was Alexey DarkGeneral from Unique Games Kiev with a story about the formation of a community in online games.  The guys from UG, by the way, have two projects behind their backs: the first, ‚ÄúHeroes Lands,‚Äù exists for more than six years, managed to gain an active audience of 200 thousand people and is the author‚Äôs world in the style of fantasy, and the second is ‚ÄúK.O.D. .  Postapokaliptika "- launched recently and is gaining momentum.  A lot of attention was paid to attracting gamers to the post-development process itself.  For example, to create a successful backbone of the project (from among mere mortals) we need not only ideas and miscalculation in advance, but also game meetings, the choice of the administration, and also about game development.  Moreover, Alexey spoke very enthusiastically about the same meetings outside the online world - it was obvious that there was experience in organizing such events.  The burning question about the Game Masters was not ignored either to pay them or to recruit from the most active players of a particular project.  In the worlds of Unique Games, ‚Äúrecruiting‚Äù is done directly online - preference is given to experienced users, as they provide substantial assistance in detecting bugs, and rarely approve of the use of world glitches by associates for personal gain.  According to Alexei, even with cheaters you can be friends and do not use the ‚ÄúBan‚Äù button too often - offended people can easily pull a couple of dozen of their acquaintances to another online fun, and these twenty, in turn, will take their friends and ... well, you understand. <br><br>  The key point of the ‚ÄúDarkGeneral community‚Äù is the coordinated work of the developers and their support teams.  For example, in Unique Games ten people are engaged in a forum (and this is not only the permanent moderation), but a dozen of their colleagues administer in-game chat.  By conclusion, DarkGeneral spoke of the so-called "difficult players" who have been, are and will always be.  He divided them into four groups - conservatives, verbiage, revolutionaries and cheaters.  The first may not like any changed trifle - even though the font size (‚ÄúI‚Äôll now wear glasses / be completely blind!‚Äù);  do not put your second finger in your mouth, but let me talk about the imminent demise of the server;  the third naturally remove comrades from the toy, if the admins offended them;  the fourth may be useful, but at least sometimes they must be punished.  However, Alexei reluctantly, but admitted that "clothes" still sell for real, and it is almost impossible to stop it. <br><br>  In general, the report turned out to be interesting, complete - many beginners simply need to adopt many items. <br><br>  Next, Denis Dovgopoly and Gleb Kaplun told about the features of attracting investment in game projects.  Just a small reservation: in Ukraine there are no real investors - an economic fact, plus people are not interested in promoting the entertainment industry - they like shipping and foundries more.  By the way, Denis flew to us from Silicon Valley specifically to tell us about the investment life of projects there and ‚Äúchange at least something‚Äù here.  Naturally, hopes for a bright future in the CIS countries do not fade away - ambitious people ready to give money have always been and always will be.  Another thing is that in the US there is a lot of excitement and panic around the entertainment industry in a good way - there are dozens of different projects considered per day and venture capitalists select the best for cash infusions.  It was extremely interesting to listen to the arguments about the prospects of our gaming industry and, again, many were really interested in ‚Äúbourgeois‚Äù financing.  In fact, in Ukraine it is necessary to sweat to raise money for the launch of a standing project, while abroad it is easier with this.  Denis, of course, touched upon the domestic market with its prospects in his report, but in the conditions of crisis shaking, few people dared to draw conclusions. <br><br>  The report ‚ÄúDomestic Electronic Money‚Äù turned out to be a small self-promoter - Vitaly Kurshinov from Unicom Systems presented options for a universal currency, thanks to which several online projects could make a profit - something like the euro in the EU and the dollar in other countries.  Of course, a weighty argument was presented by the speaker - they say, online worlds (sooner or later) are waiting for mass monetization - almost all the ‚Äústuff‚Äù and achievements can already be bought for real currency only on ‚Äúblack‚Äù websites.  Unicom makes it easy to receive money by creating secure online terminals for safe and instant purchase of things.  Projects are provided with a place on the trading floor, their own ‚Äúsupermarket‚Äù for placing goods and a convenient authorization system. <br><br>  <b>‚ÄúTeamwork, integration into social networks, casual online games‚Äù</b> <br><br>  One of the best conference presentations is Teamwork by Denis Voikhansky from Reaxion.  A guest from distant Minsk presented really interesting material, which told the participants about the opportunity to assemble their own ‚Äúdream team‚Äù.  Moreover, it is not just a theory, but a practice from the personal experience of Comrade Voikhanovsky.  The team of Dr. House, flickering behind Denis, seemed to symbolize the common goal of the speech - Voikhanovsky told so convincingly and showed that during the coffee break, a whole line crowded around him wanting to get advice.  Your submissive was also there, and even received a clear answer on the construction of the working day in gaming offices. <br><br>  Denis Voikhansky not only told how the working cycle was built in Reaxion, but also supported the words with a convincing theory.  The fundamental phrase ‚Äúfor Teamwork, if you don‚Äôt know how, it‚Äôs better not to take it at all‚Äù confirmed that it‚Äôs really very, very difficult to make a candy out of a scattered team.  Another thing is that thanks to people like the Reaxion manager, methods of rallying become known, such as: the whole team is in the same room, mutual assistance every minute (‚ÄúI will ask Petit, you will ask Sasha ... Profit!‚Äù) And the like.  The attendees also liked the red cap ‚ÄúDo not disturb‚Äù, which every Reaxion employee has and symbolizes a universal attitude towards discipline.  If it were a woman, then one could say: the team is ‚Äúunder the thumb‚Äù of her.  Only in the best sense. <br><br>  The next report - ‚ÄúIntegration of the game portal into social networks‚Äù - was presented by the guys from the regional department of the Polish Gadu-Gadu.  Using the example of their own flash portal and several other sites, they showed the convenience of the OpenID technology, which allows you to have only one account for any number of portals.  They also developed a blog system with its own messenger, which is notable for its pleasant functionality (video calls, conferences, etc.), a website where you can create your own family tree, a convenient network of forums and, especially for travelers, a whole website of the most concise routes for exciting travel. in Ukraine.  It should be added that the brainchild of "our" division of Gadu-Gadu is made in the form of blogs (but not all) - anyone can add a piece of their information, which may be useful to someone.  Projects are just recently on the Web, and attendance is already very good - the future is still about innovation. <br><br>  For a snack was a story about casual online games, their development and monetization.  The speaker, Vitaly Khit, was not the first year on the market, therefore, from theoretical figures, he quickly turned to practice.  He told about his own experience of ‚Äúcolonization‚Äù of Western publishers and about the absolute futility of our market.  He noted that, unfortunately, the ‚Äú15 minutes rule‚Äù works abroad, where people can spend 15-20 euros for a casual toy that will be removed in the same 15-20 minutes.  At us, lovers of freebies can spend an hour browsing through warez-portals, just to dig out and play for free. <br><br>  At the end of his speech, Heath suggested that the creators of the browser-based online worlds cooperate, because his company is not only aware of trends and progress, but also in anticipation of large projects.  Again, the young teams were extremely interested in such a proposal and were trying to snatch Vitaly‚Äôs attention after the conference. <br><br>  In this article we reviewed the most interesting reports.  The fact is that some of the missed works were of a purely technical nature, while others turned out to be really uninteresting from the point of view of an ordinary gamer.  The event ‚ÄúInternational Conference of the developers of online games in Ukraine‚Äù was taking place, and this is already a great event in the life of the country, which is perceived by many as ‚Äúhurray!‚Äù.  And you shouldn‚Äôt forget about the exceptional usefulness of such meetings - publishers can easily ‚Äúhook‚Äù young and talented developers, and the latter can listen to the reports of professionals and not step on the neatly decomposed rake of the gaming industry. <br><br>  Photos of the conference, materials on the reports <a href="http://confog.org.ua/2009/index.html">on the website of the First International Conference of Online Game Developers in Ukraine</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/61064/">https://habr.com/ru/post/61064/</a></p>
