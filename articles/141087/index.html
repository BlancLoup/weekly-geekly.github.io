      Let's start a little from afar.  2011 was a successful year for us, since we debuted with a new line of 3D TVs on the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/LG_Russia/blog/134030/">FRP</a> technology alternative to the entire market, we accepted the challenge and did not lose. <br><br>  Our LG Cinema 3D TVs have become bestsellers, and it is thanks to them that we: <br><ul><li>  became global # 2 on the flat-panel TV market, displacing two competitors in 2011; </li><li>  strengthened as # 2 on the Russian market, for the first time in 3 years we grew not due to the fact that we were pushing out European and Japanese brands, but because we were squeezing our competitor friend; </li><li>  We became No. 1 in sales of 3D TVs in several world markets (we are especially strong in South America, and from countries closer to us, we became No. 1 in Kazakhstan). </li></ul><br><br>  In 2011, everything was great - our 3D-TVs received the highest marks from professionals, we won litigation and proved that our TVs give Full HD images in any mode, both in 2D and in 3D. <br>  The only disadvantage noted by consumers was the ‚Äúboring‚Äù, ‚Äúsimple‚Äù, ‚Äúconservative‚Äù design of LG Cinema3D TVs. <br>  With this knowledge, we started to develop the 2012 TVs. <br><br>  Our industrial designers worked tirelessly.  The result of their creativity was the line of TVs LG Cinema3D 2012, all also uncompromising image quality, but in a new design. <br><br>  <b>LG Cinema 3D LM960V</b> <br><br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/2kkk.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  3D-TV based on FPR technology with a unique backlight Nano Full LED - LED film covering the entire perimeter of the display, allowing to reach a phenomenal level of contrast. <br>  Included: platform of new generation Smart TV, Magic Motion remote control with voice control and 4 pairs of glasses.  All modern connectors for connecting external devices here. <br><br>  Inside the TV: two processors: a powerful dual-core processor for overall performance, as well as a quad-core graphics accelerator, with the advent of which problems with flash and video from the Internet are solved.  This model has become the flagship design Cinema Screen - maximum images, minimum borders and frames. <br><br>  Available in diagonals (inches): 84;  72;  60;  55;  47 <br><br>  <b>LG Cinema 3D LM860V</b> <br><br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/3oxo.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  "Younger Brother" - LG Cinema 3D LM960V, in the presence of all the same two processors: dual-core and quad-core, Smart TV and software-enhanced Resolution Upscaler.  The only difference is the LED + backlight, and not the NANO FULL LED - the contrast, unlike the previous model, does not come close to OLED, but is at a very decent level. <br>  Included: 4 pairs of 3D glasses, 2 pairs of special dual play glasses for gamers (see below) and our miracle of bullets Magic Motion. <br><br>  Available in diagonals (inches): 55;  47 <br><br>  <b>LG Cinema 3D LM 761S</b> <br><br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/5iei.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Functionally, from the point of view of the display, the model is identical to the LG Cinema 3D LM960V, but inside there are no two processors, only one, but in terms of design, it is different in its stand and details.  In the lower unit of the TV - also a metal stand, thin lines and the complete absence of the frame. <br>  Included: 4 pairs of 3D glasses, 2 pairs of special dual play glasses and a Magic Motion remote. <br><br>  Available in diagonals (inches): 47;  42 <br><br>  <b>LG Cinema 3D LM 670S</b> <br><br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/6mzm.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Brother twin LG Cinema 3D LM 761S in a lighter case + this model will be presented in a diagonal of 55 inches. <br><br>  Available in diagonals (inches): 47;  42;  55 <br><br>  <b>LG Cinema 3D LM 669</b> <br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/7oyo.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Of course, we could not forget about the fans of white TVs, which we don‚Äôt have so many (TV sets, not fans :-). <br>  The LG Cinema 3D LM 669 stands alone because, unlike other TVs in the line, it has a white, glossy case.  Functionally, this is the same stunning 3D screen, a bright, sharp picture and Smart TV functionality. <br><br>  Available in diagonals (inches): 47;  42;  32 <br><br>  <b>LG Cinema 3D LM 660</b> <br><br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/8oio.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  For those who are ill, metallic will be an option in the classic black color.  Strict design, the same beautiful picture. <br><br>  Available in diagonals (inches): 55;  47;  42;  32 <br><br>  In addition to the flagship models, which we talked about above, low-cost models of LG Cinema 3D of various options will also be presented.  Most of them will be presented with Full HD LED displays, TrueMotion technology, advanced 2D to 3D converters. <br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/9fof.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The redesign touched not only TVs, but also 3D glasses.  They are still easy, inexpensive, and most importantly, extremely comfortable, even when watching the longest films. <br><br>  Design points for every taste: <br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/10vnv.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  If it speaks of technical innovations, then the 2012 LG Cinema3D is: <br><br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/opo.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Brighter colors, both in 2D and in 3D, thanks to FPR technology, as well as Dynamic Color Enhancer technology, which calibrates and adjusts color reproduction in dynamics without external intervention. <br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/owo.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Unprecedented image contrast, thanks to the uniform LED system and the Local Contrast Plus system, which programmatically enhances the brightness of LED diodes in places where it is needed (the technology is available on flagship models). <br><br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/rwr.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The Resolution Upscaler feature is a software option to increase video resolution to HD, even for content shot at a lower resolution. <br><br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/wnw.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Comfortable, light, inexpensive glasses that do not require recharging, do not cause headaches and eye fatigue.  3D image without flicker, split and headache. <br><br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/bgb.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  High-quality conversion of 2D content into a 3D image. <br><br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/wjw.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Advanced 3D image management functionality.  You can independently configure which type of 3D image is preferable - a deep picture or 3D "off-screen".  All in your hands! <br><br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/vvv.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Unique LG Dual Play functionality.  Special glasses allow you to play on the console on one TV, but at the same time each of the players will see their playing field in full screen.  Ideal for racing and sports! <br><br>  Remote control Magic Motion with motion sensors, working like a mouse.  In 2012, we improved the ergonomics of the console and added voice control, including in Russian. <br><br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/jej.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On this, perhaps, we will stop our presentation, although we have something else to tell (for example, about the same Smart TV in 2012) - but we will leave the details ‚Äúlater‚Äù. <br><br>  Anticipating numerous questions, we answer, TVs will go on sale in the next two months, unfortunately, we cannot yet announce the exact dates.  The cost also can not be made public, but be sure that it will pleasantly surprise ;-) <br><br>  We will be glad to your questions and comments. <br><br>  LG team. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/141087/">https://habr.com/ru/post/141087/</a></p>
