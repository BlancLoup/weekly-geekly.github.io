Not as clumsy and inaccurate as a blaster.  An elegant weapon of a more civilized era ... <br>  <i>(Ben "Obi-Wan" Kenobi, a brief description of the blue Jedi sword, given here solely for word of mouth)</i> </blockquote><br><img align="left" width="290" alt="Jedi Its Oscillose" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e8c/7e3/8c3/e8c7e38c3413408c9007abd210962840.JPG">  The desire to invent or improve something is as natural for a man as to have a relationship with a woman.  At least, I consider this statement fair for the lion‚Äôs share of the audience of a respected portal.  We do not saw so much as mechanics, auto mechanics, builders and public servants do, but we do it very intellectually, because we have such work.  Almost like surgeons, only their responsibility is of a different order. <br><br>  When creating a computer chassis for ‚Äúsmart‚Äù furniture, it took me somehow to cut a thin aluminum profile, many times and in some places it was figured.  And then I saw the fifth corner of a small hand saw on metal, quietly cursing myself and thinking: I'm not a monkey, I must somehow solve the problem of automating manual labor.  Indeed, in addition to electric jigsaws and angle grinders ("Bulgarians"), the market now abounds with circular, trimming, saber and other types of saws of varying degrees of high cost and slaughter.  But I don‚Äôt provide emergency services for replacing radiators, it‚Äôs not possible to grind the grinder at all, and it‚Äôs inconvenient to cut small parts.  Does not go out of my head and an accident with a "grinder" from a neighbor (about safety techniques separately).  It was here that I remembered about a hand-held power tool with strange attachments, similar to the one in the picture, just from another manufacturer. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  DISCLAIMER </h4><br><blockquote>  I ask the distinguished audience to abstract from the brands seen (or not seen) in the pictures.  I don‚Äôt want to turn a publication into an advertisement of a specific producer, it‚Äôs important for me to bring the principle of action together with the advantages and disadvantages, and I don‚Äôt have any doubts in the ability of a respected reader to make the right choice without my hint. <br><br>  The second important point - corrosion as a consequence of metalworking.  I recommend to study permissible and unacceptable contacts of metals in accordance with GOST 9.005-72, excerpts from which I put in a separate <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/282244/">publication</a> , providing a convenient color cheat sheet. </blockquote><br><h4>  Modus operandi oscillating instrument </h4><br>  This unconvincing gizmo uses high-frequency pendulum oscillations (oscillations) with a small amplitude, literally into several saw teeth, instead of rotational energy.  It seems that the instrument was borrowed from surgeons who have to cut and saw in hard-to-reach places without hitting anything extra.  Of course, the electric wire is not a femoral artery, but power cables also require respect.  Probably, it was for IT specialists that a hand tool was invented without a specific trading name, which we are talking about here.

      Some sellers call it correctly, but vague: <i>an oscillating tool</i> .  Others are just an <i>electric chisel</i> .  Someone prefers sonorous <i>renovator</i> , under the name of one of the trade brands.  You can also find the term "multitool", which, however, is overloaded from a manual folding tool.  Surgeons have this <i>sagittal saw</i> *, physicians cannot do without their Latin ciphers.  I decided for myself to use a simple and capacious: <b>oscillorez</b> , or <i>pendulum oscillorez</i> . <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">* Sagittal saw?</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Dedicated to all fans of Dr. Hannibal Lecter. <br><img align="left" width="419" height="262" alt="sagittal saw" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dfa/0f9/da6/dfa0f9da68bf4780a0a35e46ed6474b2.jpg">  I assume that the name comes from the anatomical "sagittal section", which vertically divides the human body into left and right halves.  Doctors, do not laugh, better tell me how it really is.  And at the same time, clarify whether a surgical sagittal saw is of the circular type, and not oscillating. <br><br clear="all">  The picture is literally from the first site, here's a description: <br><blockquote>  It is intended for carrying out surgical operations on human joints. It contains a contactless micromotor of the magnetoelectric type, a mechanism for converting the rotary motion of the rotor into a reciprocating oscillatory motion of the saw and an electronic control unit.  There is a mechanism for regulating the spatial position of the saw in two planes.  Power consumption 20 VA;  Saw oscillation frequency 0 ... 300 Hz;  The amplitude of the saw blade ¬± 2.5 degrees. </blockquote><br>  <b>UPD: The</b> doctors, by the way, <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/281918/">joined</a> the discussion, and didn‚Äôt even laugh much.  Moreover, they even admitted using household oscillose (from the hozmag) for medical tasks that do not require surgical hygiene.  Why not? </div></div><br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> History of Invention <br>  As suggested by the author of the publication, the first MFI, aka ‚Äúrenovator‚Äù, he is an oscillating instrument, etc.  invented for medical purposes in the company <a href="https://fein.com/en_uk/oscillators/history/">Fein</a> in 1967.  I thank user <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/pbw/" class="user_link">pbw</a> for <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/281918/">comments</a> and links (both positive and tragic), as well as UFOs for cosmetic edits. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9b1/fe5/1e3/9b1fe51e3592422f98af16a6351e9d47.png"></div><br>  In the photo: a group of surgeons is going to remove a circular (i.e., a continuous circular) plaster bandage with an oscillating tool from the recovered boy's leg.  There were no semicircular saw tips for the oscillosis, therefore at first it seems as if the leg is going to be amputated along with the plaster.  This is not the case; the oscillator has a ‚Äúmagical‚Äù property to cut hard plaster (or bone) without injuring * soft * fabrics.  However, if the fabric under the plaster is not soft and pink, but dry and scaly, you will have to get scratches, the user <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/loki3000/" class="user_link">Loki3000</a> <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/281918/">shared his</a> experience).  But first things first. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">About Fein</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  The company has existed for more than 140 years and invented many well-known power tools.  Now it produces mainly industrial tools, and in the ‚Äúdomestic‚Äù sector it is perhaps the best, but also the most expensive brand.  Oscillating instrument ‚ÄúFein‚Äù was produced for medical workers: sagittal saws for working with bones of the skull, saws for other bones, for removing plaster.  See also <a href="http://www.komirb.ru/pageprint.php%3F215">cranioplasty</a> .  User <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/ariez/" class="user_link">Ariez</a> <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/281918/">noted the</a> successful use of an oscillating instrument in orthopedics, for example, in operations on the knee joints.  When using the nozzle of the submersible type, the ratio of the width of the cut to its depth is much more advantageous for an oscillator saw than for a circular saw.  Although chisels and rasps have not been canceled, <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/ariez/" class="user_link">Ariez</a> notes. <br><br>  After the patent for an oscillating instrument ended in 2008, it was possible for <a href="http://remotn.ru/q/instrument/electro/7855-vibracionnyj-mnogofunkcionalnyj-instrument.html">everyone to feel it</a> . </div></div><br>  Immediately make a reservation: no miracles.  The interviewed experts do not like the oscillating tool at all because of its low productivity (the chief engineer of the construction company and the owner of a small furniture business participated in the survey).  Oscillose is a lightweight option for homework and eliminating small shoals with a variety of interchangeable tips. <br><br><h4>  Nozzles </h4><br>  DISCLAIMER: when buying, carefully check for what material is this or that nozzle, consult with the seller. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Saw saw (rectangular)</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img width="400" height="400" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d2d/bb0/1c8/d2dbb01c8b7a461fa4e456657d3f707b.jpg">  It has the shape of a rectangle with a width of 1..3 cm.  If the nozzle were rotated 360 ¬∞, the saw side would form acc.  chord 1..3cm at the imaginary circle.  But this thing swings by about 3 ¬∞, so we roughly believe that the teeth of the saw go along the chord.  If you even cut a tree with a dive strictly normal, then at a depth of half a centimeter the nozzle can be locked in the cut.  In this position, all the vibrational energy is returned to the operator's body, and as a result, instead of the wall, only his nervous system is sawn.  Therefore, if you need a mini-well, then it should be done at an angle, going deep into variable <i>tacks</i> , so that on both sides of the ‚Äúpendulum‚Äù there always remains an empty space of two or three oscillations amplitudes.  It is simple, but requires practice, or the use of a semicircular (sector) nozzle. <br><br>  The rectangular nozzle is good for cutting small parts that interfere with installation: protruding parts of door jambs, badly twisted self-tapping screws, out-of-place plastic pipes, or skirtings directly on the wall.  Especially good where there is a risk of accidentally sawing the entire door frame together with a piece of wall with a grinder. </div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Half-circular saw, √† la grinder</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img width="400" height="400" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0a8/1e7/073/0a81e70739324ca1b3cb5bc08c65310e.jpg">  It has the shape of a wide-angle sector and is, perhaps, the closest approximation of the saw blade of an <s>angle grinder of a</s> circular saw, but does not fly apart when destroyed, and is unlikely to collapse.  It copes well with most tasks and therefore wears out faster than other attachments.  When recessed into the part is not blocked as the "submersible" (rectangular) nozzle. </div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Sanding plate triangular</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img width="400" height="400" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a0a/71b/51c/a0a71b51c4aa4cb6a62a35ac7917dad1.jpg">  Why do we need triangular plates?  As well as on round ones, sandpaper with the necessary grain is attached here, but the triangle will allow you to reach the very top of the corner, where traditional grinding machines of circular, belt or eccentric type will not reach. </div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Diamond semicircular</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img width="400" height="400" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a47/64c/fba/a4764cfbabbf4cda861b0978e478a191.jpg"><br>  Same as a half circular saw, only with a <s>diamond</s> tungsten carbide edge for shaving a tile (removing the grout). </div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Diamond triangular</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img width="400" height="400" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/14f/1fd/ad4/14f1fdad42b442d196373feceede78fe.jpg">  The combination of a triangular shape and a <s>diamond</s> tungsten-carbide coating for processing hard-to-reach places of cement, ceramic tiles, sludge, etc. </div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Tearing away</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img width="400" height="400" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/540/94e/1a0/54094e1a0cac42689a53cc93e35cf729.jpg">  The shape resembles a rectangular (immersion) saw blade, only massive, with one longitudinal wedge instead of transverse teeth.  If you want to tear off something urgently, an oscillating scraper can significantly speed up the solution of this problem.  However, if you want to tear off all the linoleum in the school gym, it will still be a long time, the amateur class tool will overheat. </div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Dust removal option</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Some tools have a removable nozzle for connecting a vacuum cleaner.

In general, I <s>don‚Äôt really trust</s> , I strongly don‚Äôt trust the cutting of the <i>angle grinder</i> .  Yes, who does not know, "Bulgarian" is intended for grinding, and cutting (not sawing!) Is its side property.  Why - read the instructions for angle grinders, spoiler and comments.  Cutting discs are available for angle grinders, and saw blades are designed for circular saws.  You can dispute this postulate, but then you have to challenge the laws of Natural Selection at the same time ... <br><br>  <b>UPD: Dear colleagues in the IT department, <i>modders of</i> buildings and all the rest!</b> <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Problem about a very hard disk</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Here you have a problem in physics.  It is given: a very high-speed hard disk, the diameter of a single pancake is 6 ", weight is 300g, power consumption is 1kW. It is required to calculate the energy transferred to the body of the‚Äú storage device ‚Äùat an instantaneous deceleration of the‚Äú pancake ‚Äùfrom 11000r / min. weighing 300g consumed 1kW of power and made almost 200 revolutions * per second *. Then suddenly it stopped abruptly, transferring a significant part of the kinetic energy of rotation to an iron iron. Then an iron with a mass of 2kg (with a still rotating blade) jumps right on  ittalnoe * section only without anesthesia and even without the presence of doctors. Tom would let go early so dead scared primate grip does not give ... <br><br>  Do you have the grip of the Terminator or, at least, the severe Siberian lumberjack?  Then of course, take a grinder.  I described a fairly likely physicomechanical layout in a situation with a jammed disk.  Sticking * is very likely * even with small deviations from the optimum cutting angle, especially if we work in a hard-to-reach place.  Colleagues in the comments described everything in sufficient detail, listing the severed body parts.  I even went to the forums on the links, read.  There are even those who survived after the <i>kiss of the grinder</i> and wrote about it, but there are very few of them. <br><br>  * What is saggital section, see one of the spoilers above. </div></div><br>  <b>UPD:</b> <br>  In the comments they gave a link to special trident saw blades, which, they say, can still be used on angle grinders.  But I wouldn't :) <br><br>  Safety precautions when working with angle grinders and similar tools: when working, always hold on to the protective cover, preferably outside the plane of rotation.  <b>Insert the tool into the part as shown by the instructions of the specific device, do not look at other pictures!</b>  Believe me, it is better to stream sawdust in the face than an ax that makes 200 revolutions per second!  Study the manual, find out how to avoid both.  Watch for turns, do not overheat the disc, cut strictly at 90 ¬∞, destruction or seizure of the disc is <b>deadly</b> . <br><br>  I apologize to the experienced builders and experienced Jedi, but I want to draw the attention of the intellectual elite to a completely logical, but not quite expected kinetics.  When the disk is jammed, the ‚ÄúBulgarian‚Äù jumps in the plane of rotation, but the most likely direction of the ‚Äúthrow‚Äù (recoil) is opposite to the jet of sparks and sawdust flying from under the disk.  This is probably the reason for such a frequent and disastrous injury: an unprepared operator tries to get away from the sheaf of sparks, substituting his head and neck for a chopping power of about 1 kW.  When working with the ‚Äúgrinder‚Äù, there are only a few * goggles *, we need a mask for the whole face, a hat and clothing made of thick and durable matter, especially in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe head and neck.  And in the summer too: it‚Äôs better to sweat for half an hour than to lie in the fridge later.  The easiest way, by the way, to owners of two-wheeled vehicles is that they have practically all the equipment, an accident on a motorcycle and ‚Äúthe kiss of the Bulgarian‚Äù I personally consider to be fairly similar in terms of probability and consequences. <br><br>  Reciprocating saw is a great alternative for cutting and sawing. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">About the accident with angle grinders</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  I had a neighbor who was cutting a huge steel sheet 5mm thick with a tiny grinder, and one summer evening he was gone.  Neighbor, I mean.  The uncut leaf then lay all autumn and winter with a rusty monument until a silent janitor took it in the direction of the metal receiving point.  In the meantime, the steel has rusted, the tenants smoking on the balcony gazed at the deep and uneven cuts on the sheet, rising from under the snow.  Involuntarily think about the transience of the whole worldly ... </div></div><br>  So, the oscilloresis does not have fast-rotating parts, it has nothing to explode and cripple.  Moreover, the representatives of medicine confirmed in the comments that with a sufficiently low amplitude of oscillations, it is possible to rest the working tool into one‚Äôs own flesh without fear of cutting ... No, no, I meant removing the ‚Äúcircular‚Äù plaster bandages from the extremities, and not what some thought readers. <br><br>  But the circular saw of errors does not forgive, either a real Jedi fitter or an idiot can stick their fingers under the casing.  Fans of sawing with a grinder (LBM) are arguing with Natural Selection, and this is too strong a player, I would not even play a normal roulette with it. <br><br><h4>  First sensations </h4><br>  And now, I finally take the oscillose in the manner of a Jedi sword, turn it on and militantly swing at the aluminum corner clamped in a vice.  I start to cut with a semicircular nozzle.  The detail is trembling, but not from fear, but from vibrations, along with a vice and a table.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And while I am drinking, all the nearby contents of the table come to life and start dancing: light garbage leads round dances around more massive pieces; </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">hardware sneak to the edge of the table with the clear intention to fall to the floor and violate all conservation laws, bouncing to the farthest corner; </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">without leaving the case, a pair of files joins them unhurriedly. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And here the hammer reached there, obviously aiming to fall on my foot. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">All this vibroshow distracts attention. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Remove from the table everything that is not fixed, especially heavy and sharp. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It may be worth removing the expensive mechanical watch from your hand. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">To cut the PC case with hard disks with an oscillating tool is undesirable, especially when turned on. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Why are there spindle disks, civilian ‚Äúiron‚Äù, in principle, does not like vibrations, this is not industrial electronics for a drilling station.</font></font><br><br><div class="spoiler"> <b class="spoiler_title"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Metal</font></font></b> <div class="spoiler_text"> ,    ¬´¬ª,       ,    .    -    M10   ¬´¬ª.  ,     10   ,   ,   20    ,    .       .     ,      ,       .      ,       :  ,      ,     (   )  . <br><br> ,   , -,    :          ,           .     ,  -       ,  .  ,     -    ¬´  ¬ª,     . </div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Tree</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  -        :   .        .         .  , LTE         - 20..30¬∞  .         -,         ‚Ä¶   - .         ,        .   ‚Äî          .          ¬´¬ª,      .    -       ,         . </div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Plastic</b> <div class="spoiler_text">         Legrand DLP. , -          ,  **          1:1000,    .   -     ,     ,   ,         . </div></div><br><h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Comparison with other tools </font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">To stop the clumsy grinder or drill of a drill exactly on the edge only real Jedi are capable. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You can‚Äôt take a deep crown detail. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Large rectangular holes can be approximated by drilling in a row, but there will be an ugly edge sampling. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Jigsaw does not make blind holes at all, they must first be drilled.</font></font><br><br>  <b>UPD</b> <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It turns out that a jigsaw under certain conditions is able to make a deaf pocket using a trick known as ‚Äúplunging‚Äù: although it requires some spatial scope, it looks quite affordable. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Thank users </font></font><a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/ezhyg/" class="user_link"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Ezhyg</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> and </font></font><a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/realraven/" class="user_link"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">realraven</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> for comments.</font></font><br><div class="spoiler"> <b class="spoiler_title"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">jigsaw cutting</font></font></b> <div class="spoiler_text"><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/529/233/b58/529233b583bc4fe895568fcb9c0283c6.jpg"></div><br><blockquote>          ,     . <br> 1.         ,      .
