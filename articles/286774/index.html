      <b>Positive reinforcement</b> is an event that coincides with an action and leads to an increased likelihood of re-doing this action. <br><br>  There are two types of reinforcements: positive and negative.  The positive is what the subject desires: food, affection, or praise.  Negative reinforcement - this is what the subject does not want: slap, frowning eyebrows, unpleasant sound, uncomfortable situation. <br><br>  Take the situation with the calls of children to parents.  Parents want their children to call them as often as possible, but children often do not.  There are two options for reinforcement.  The positive will be that as soon as the children call, they need to say: ‚Äúhow great it is that you called‚Äù.  The caller is likely to want to repeat it.  The negative reinforcement will be like this: ‚ÄúWhy haven't you called for so long?  Why do I have to call you every time? ‚Äù  Here the son does not want to call again to avoid such situations.  In fact, you teach him not to call. <br><br>  On Habr√© and Megamind, an example of positive reinforcement is karma, rating, and achivki badges. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1a9/212/dca/1a9212dcaa5241d19b8e2e80a5b2d80e.png"><br><br>  Wrote a good post, - got a plus to karma.  Wrote a bad post - you have negative reinforcement and, as a result, unwillingness to write in the future in general.  So, ultimately, stubborn and stubborn users are filtered. <br><br><h4>  Reinforcement time </h4><br>  Well, when reinforcement is given on time.  If you say something like ‚Äúto your wife,‚Äú Yesterday you looked just perfect, ‚Äùit won't be as good as if you said it right away.  If you asked for a dog net and she sat down, you need to immediately give her reinforcements.  When she gets up it will be definitely late. <br>  On the other hand, reinforcements can be given too early and this will not help either.  Reinforcing attempts will not necessarily lead to a result.  For example, if you praise a new employee just for trying, he may get used to trying hard enough, but the result is optional. <br><br><h4>  Magnitude reinforcements </h4><br>  What should be reinforcement?  -Less is better.  Reinforcement should be easily digestible and should not turn into something very significant.  If you train animals, give them something to eat in 5 seconds.  It is accepted among people that the harder the work, the stronger and more significant reinforcement must be. <br><br>  And there is also a <b>jackpot</b> .  This is 100 times more than normal reinforcement and always unexpected.  This may be a sudden cake in the office, brought by the head without any reason.  Or it may be a spontaneous trip to St. Petersburg Divostrov with children.  Such a reinforcement (it seems undeserved) also works.  But it must be sudden and really big. <br><br><h4>  Conditional reinforcement </h4><br>  We like New Year's music, because it means that the New Year is coming and it will be an interesting, and, I hope, sober holiday.  We do not like the smell of the dental office, because this smell is followed by tooth drilling, sometimes pain and a lot of money and time spent.  These are, in essence, deferred reinforcements: first there is a sign of reinforcement, and then the reinforcement itself.  The money we work for is also conditional reinforcement.  Worked ‚Üí received money ‚Üí purchased a new car. <br><br><h4>  Modes of reinforcements </h4><br>  No need to give reinforcements forever.  Once the subject has learned the desired behavior, you can give reinforcements in a random and unpredictable manner.  If you once taught a child to ride a bike, you will not praise him for the rest of his life.  It will be, at least, strange.  But it is rare and spontaneous reinforcements will be the stimulating moment that can support the behavior. <br><br>  An example from personal practice: if a designer works at a constant average (or slightly below average) level, then surges of geality serve as such support from his side.  I think in such moments: ‚ÄúHe is, of course, a scoundrel, but sometimes he gives out very good things that customers like.  So, it‚Äôs not necessary to dismiss him yet. ‚Äù <br><br><h2>  2. The process of making </h2><br>  When the subject is already doing what is needed and just needs to reinforce this behavior, everything is more or less clear.  But what to do if the desired behavior is not yet and reinforce, as if, and nothing? <br>  The development is to use the slightest tendency to the desired behavior and step by step to shift it to the goal.  Break the final goal into a series of successive, smaller goals.  Find some behavior that is being implemented now, as a first step.  It often happens that the subject can perform the desired task (or part of it) by chance.  In this case, you need to be sure to notice this behavior and back it up. <br><br>  Below are 10 rules of development, which are analyzed in detail by the author.  As part of this article, a detailed description does not fit, but you can superficially familiarize yourself with them. <br><ol><li>  Increase the criterion little by little, so that there is always the opportunity to fulfill the required and get reinforcements. </li><li>  Practice one thing at a time.  Do not try to work out several criteria at the same time. </li><li>  Before moving on to higher levels, back up the current </li><li>  Introducing new criteria temporarily weaken the old </li><li>  Plan your training program so that you are always ready for a dramatic progress in training. </li><li>  Do not change trainers in the process of developing a specific skill. </li><li>  If one way of working is not successful, find another way.  A lot of them </li><li>  Do not complete the training without giving positive reinforcement.  This is tantamount to punishment. </li><li>  If the skill deteriorates, quickly go through the entire previous learning process, giving reinforcements </li><li>  End the training on a high note.  The end of the training should be joyful, not dull. </li></ol><br><br><h2>  3. Weaning </h2><br>  Karen Pryor also writes about the process of weaning.  Those.  when there is some undesirable behavior that you want to get rid of.  She cites 8 principles of weaning.  The first four of them are negative, and the second are positive.  As you can guess, the second half of the principles works better and gives a lingering result. <br><ol><li>  Kill, remove, get rid of.  Just remove the source or organic him so that he could not physically perform an undesirable action. </li><li>  Punishment.  Put the child in the corner, hit the dog with a stick, deprive the programmer of the award </li><li>  Negative reinforcement </li><li>  Extinguish  Do not pay attention to undesirable behavior.  Do not support it in any way: neither negative nor positive. </li><li>  Develop incompatible behavior.  Develop a new behavior that is incompatible with undesirable. </li><li>  To ensure that this behavior is performed by a signal, and then gradually remove this signal </li><li>  Formation of absence.  Anything but undesirable behavior is reinforced. </li><li>  Change of motivation.  Determine why and why undesirable behavior occurs and try to replace the target of the behavior with a more necessary / correct one. </li></ol><br><br>  <b>PS:</b> Karen Pryor writes a lot about animal training, but these same principles can also be successfully applied in our daily life.  I personally, in the process of reading the book, noticed how positive reinforcements personally affect me.  I can say that having mastered the science outlined in the book, you can really get a +1 to communication, as it was announced on the cover of the book. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/286774/">https://habr.com/ru/post/286774/</a></p>
