With the announcement of Siri and other voice assistants, an opinion was born that a new milestone appeared in this story.  I am convinced that Siri and analogs are still only a sample of the pen. <br><br>  To date, the voice interface is very limited in features.  But the new revolution in the UX, as the touch devices became, was the bots and the conversation UX (about which so much is being written in the west).  This is not just a trend or a banal alternative to solve existing problems.  This is a new way to interact with the interface, expanding horizons.

      I suggest you take a look at my selection of the best bots for Slack.  I understand that not everyone uses Slack as a tool for corporate communications, but I am sure that bots will be interesting for many precisely in the context of ‚Äúconversational interfaces‚Äù.  In my opinion, it is impossible to interpret the functionality described below with such a high level of usability. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  <a href="https://meekan.com/slack/">Meekan</a> </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/377/a2b/193/377a2b1936c04993958bcce44f489659.png"><br><br>  A great assistant in organizing corporate meetings and plans.  When building a work calendar within the team, Meekan takes into account the list of affairs of each employee and their time zones.  Also, the bot easily allows you to reorganize the list of cases, taking into account the wishes of each. <br><br><h4>  <a href="http://www.roundtable.team/">Roundtable</a> </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1d5/5bc/e7c/1d55bce7c3734d6486e75b2e42f1c115.gif"><br><br>  When each member of the team is aware of each other‚Äôs work status, the performance takes off.  It is time to say goodbye to the old reporting system.  Roundtable using the create keyword allows you to maintain a collective todo list.  The bot also automatically requests updates on the status of the task, which gives the whole team an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat is happening and who needs help. <br><br><h4>  <a href="http://statsbot.co/">Statsbot</a> </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e76/e5b/8d4/e76e5b8d4ede4f5689541be1322fc415.gif"><br><br>  Any working dialogue about statistics or behavioral factors requires uploading data from relevant services.  Moreover, the live presence of several people in front of one screen is often necessary.  Statsbot will change your idea of ‚Äã‚Äãteamwork with analytical tools.  The bot integrates with Google Analytics, New Relic, Mixpanel and sends various metrics directly to your corporate chat.  Statsbot is one of the most popular bots for Slack, which is already used by more than 4,000 teams around the world. <br><br><h4>  <a href="https://www.atomickit.com/">Atomic kit</a> </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/744/4d6/bf0/7444d6bf0ed94db0aed3d61c0521336f.png"><br><br>  Afraid to miss the most significant details of the conversation?  Atomic Kit will not allow important messages to be lost in your team.  The bot aggregates messages marked with an asterisk and sends them as an email digest to all participants in the conversation according to a predetermined schedule. <br><br><h4>  <a href="http://www.nikabot.com/">Nikabot</a> </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4e4/fb2/a1f/4e4fb2a1f96344238b5eff1733e308f4.png"><br><br>  A useful tool for controlling the workflow in a company.  Nikabot interviews employees about what they do and, based on the data, creates an informative and interactive progress report for management.  It costs only $ 1 per month. <br><br><h4>  <a href="https://dbot.demisto.com/">Dbot</a> </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a94/e65/da2/a94e65da2c6e4127a3bb23e76c4292bf.png"><br><br>  Have you ever thought about the safety of information received in your Slack channels?  Meet the first antivirus for corporate chat - Dbot.  Dbot runs in the background and warns about malicious and dangerous content in the feed: IP addresses, files, URLs, MD5 hash, and more. <br><br><h4>  <a href="https://www.workato.com/workbot-slack">Workbot</a> </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/618/eac/164/618eac16457b4a5da7375f8a75ff0cbb.png"><br><br>  The bot provides the ability to work with various cloud applications directly in Slack.  There is no just parsing information (although this, of course, too), namely, to work.  Add a subscriber to the company at MailChimp, update the lead in SalesForce, create a new ticket in Github or Jira and all this without leaving Slack.  Workbot understands the context and assists you, allowing you to interact with all services on an intuitive level. <br><br>  For example, if Workbot notifies you about a new ticket marked as a high priority task in Zendesk, the bot will ask: ‚ÄúWould you like to see more information about this client?‚Äù.  If the answer is "Yes", then it will display information about the profile of this user from SalesForce to Slack.  Plus, add a new profile note is a client, you can also chat directly. <br><br><h4>  <a href="https://relay.knowtify.io/">Relay</a> </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e93/482/49e/e9348249e8284bb3aae63a7ed54b8dc6.png"><br><br>  It's no secret that the most attractive products are created by teams that are as close as possible to their customers.  And Relay will help you with this.  The bot monitors the user activity of your application and notifies you about all sorts of events in the corresponding Slack channels.  Relay is based on the Segment.com analytical platform. <br><br><h4>  <a href="https://www.growbot.io/">Growbot</a> </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cc0/c86/461/cc0c864618fa4ca4b6db369086011156.png"><br><br>  The main component of a high employee productivity indicator is his motivation.  It is also equally important for him to have a clear understanding of the result of the work done.  And it‚Äôs very cool when there are elements of gamification in this process.  Growbot recognizes words (props, kudos, etc.) and assigns points to the person to whom they refer.  <a href="https://plusplus.chat/">PlusPlus</a> and <a href="https://www.heytaco.chat/">HeyTaco</a> also want to be mentioned. <br><br><h4>  <a href="https://safelink.io/">Safelink</a> </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/824/c90/879/824c9087908f465caff3e8b663e62cdd.png"><br><br>  Safelink introduces an extra level of security for the most important information.  Bot uploads a message or file to the remote server of Amazon's SSE-S3 about TLS with AES_256_CBC, which will be available within 24 hours.  You can read the message only after authentication through a special code sent to the phone number. <br><br><h4>  <a href="https://www.officevibe.com/slack">Leo</a> </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9d9/990/8d3/9d99908d30bd476aa9584d08cd965829.png"><br><br>  The kindest bot that measures and increases the level of satisfaction of your employees.  Leo anonymously asks unobtrusive questions ‚ÄúHow would you rate your relationship with your colleagues?‚Äù, ‚ÄúDo you enjoy your work?‚Äù, ‚ÄúDo you understand the tasks set before you‚Äù. <br><br><h4>  <a href="http://www.appsonchat.com/">Ace</a> </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d83/8f2/4be/d838f24be0a948329a1d49d21b1b026e.png"><br><br>  Convenient and functional task scheduler.  Ace can not only make todo lists, but also allows the bot to delegate tasks to other employees and conduct team polls.  In order to set a task, sufficiently indicate at the beginning of the sentence ‚Äútodo‚Äù. <br><br>  Many thanks to all for your attention. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/279091/">https://habr.com/ru/post/279091/</a></p>
