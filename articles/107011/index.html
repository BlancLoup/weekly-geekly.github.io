  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Data recovery. Qualifications and companies</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Faced with the problem of data loss, be very careful and <br>  careful!  Their fate may depend on your actions. <br>  Currently, there are a huge number of companies on the market, one way or another. <br>  otherwise involved in information recovery.  Man who for the first time <br>  faced the problem of data loss, often simply does not know what to do <br>  further and who to contact.  Someone learns about the company from advertising, someone <br>  Appeals on the advice of friends, someone just goes to the nearest service or <br>  relates a familiar geek.  In order not to be mistaken in the choice, and not to lose <br>  your data forever, you need to make sure that your chosen company <br>  can provide expert assistance, and is responsible for the quality of their work. <br>  Features and criteria for assessing the quality of services that everyone should know: <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>1. Beware of prepaid companies.</b>  If you are asked <br>  money ahead - be careful.  Many companies operate according to the principle <br>  ‚ÄúOnce‚Äù, i.e.  not completing the order, or receiving unsatisfactory <br>  the result is issued an order to the client.  Return the money will only through the court, but <br>  not many want to mess with it.  But in some cases, prepayment happens <br>  reasonable, for example when swapping a block of magnetic heads or working <br>  with opened drives, as  it is due to the consumption of materials <br>  spare parts, and often associated with the use of so-called <br>  donors. <br><br>  <b>2.Professional companies offer fixed prices.</b>  Simply <br>  Calling the data recovery company can learn a lot. <br>  One of the important issues is the issue of price.  If you hear a lengthy answer, <br>  they say: ‚Äúbring, it will be seen‚Äù or ‚Äúit all depends on the problem‚Äù, be <br>  are attentive.  Companies that are professionally involved in recovery <br>  data have fixed prices, which can vary only by <br>  coordination with the client (for example, if a donor head unit with <br>  new / good drive, procedures with opened drives, etc.). <br>  So you will be sure that by giving the drive for data recovery, the price <br>  will not fly up, for example due to the fact that the manager will notice the brand <br>  car on which you came.

        </script>
      <br>
      <b>3. All work must have a time frame.</b>  On the question of the timing you <br>  should get a very specific answer, because  companies involved <br>  data recovery professionally, and not occasionally or in <br>  time free from main work have certain temporary <br>  standards for work (unless otherwise agreed with the client).  So you will <br>  are insured from the fact that your order will not be postponed until better times or when <br>  hands reach him.  This also violates the companies disguised as <br>  qualified.  Such companies produce only light work, the same <br>  work that they can not afford them more qualified.  it <br>  may affect both the price and the timing in a big way. <br><br>  <b>4. Ask for the price list.</b>  Or ask about the specific cost for <br>  your drive.  Prices for any work must be justified, not <br>  taken from the ceiling.  Be wary of the indication of the price ‚ÄúFrom: and To:‚Äù.  Extensive Price - <br>  the guarantee that the company provides qualified assistance and is responsible for <br>  quality of service. <br><br>  <b>5. Follow the work of staff.</b>  When ordering, your drive must accept <br>  data recovery specialist, not a secretary who does not have <br>  proper qualifications.  He must conduct a survey for recovery <br>  and existing problems.  In addition, for the recovery period you should <br>  issue a receipt indicating the drives and their serial numbers (for example, <br>  case of hard drives).  So you will be sure that you will be given back <br>  it is your drive, not some kind of similar one.  It is not necessary <br>  take a disk for a copy of the data, because  professional firms possess <br>  extensive bank of various drives for copies.  Copying <br>  produced on their drives, and only having received a result that satisfies <br>  client data can be transferred to your disk, and without <br>  additional charges. <br><br>  <b>6. Learn about where to place an order.</b>  Presence of several offices <br>  data recovery companies allow you to serve customers faster. <br>  If the company has courier delivery, then you need <br>  make sure the courier is a specialist and has proof of it <br>  documents. <br><br>  <b>PS got it easy.</b>  <b>come from all sorts of burned masters.</b>  <b>we paid the money, we did not get it.</b>  <b>need to think more.</b>  - read and do not fall.  And better make copies of critical data and more often. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/107011/">https://habr.com/ru/post/107011/</a></p>
