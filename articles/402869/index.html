      <b>Withings go</b> <br><br>  Wizings is once the largest manufacturer of wearable electronics and digital health gadgets.  Thanks largely to this brand, we learned that tonometers can be synchronized with a smartphone, and scales measure pulse.  Scales, by the way, to this day remain among the best. <br><br>  And so, in 2016, the company <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/interesnye-gadzhety/withings-go.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_medium%3Dtracker%26utm_campaign%3Dwithings">announces the</a> tracker ‚ÄúGo‚Äù at CES. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d68/f20/6ab/d68f206ab60c48cc8a6e6cce2b377f51.JPG"><br><br>  Unlike most gadgets of the product line, this tracker was clearly aimed at young people: a simple design, rather a sports orientation, high autonomy and the E-ink display still relevant at that time, much loved by Pebble. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/37f/95e/804/37f95e8043074742974dc97135828b27.JPG"><br><br>  The gadget comes complete with two types of mounts: a bracelet and something like a dongle.  Like the Pulse O2 tracker in its time, the tracker can be fixed on the belt, and thanks to the hole in the dongle, the tracker can now be turned into a key chain!  This is also clearly a decision addressed to the young. <br><br>  Before you hang it in a convenient way for you, the customizer in the application will ask you to perform several simple steps and warn you that the tracker must be worn on the wrist to track the swim.  It will also offer to choose a color scheme, no matter how strange it sounds in relation to E-Ink. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/55a/226/806/55a22680615f4f4b82f1f993359b04d6.JPG"><br><br>  Or so: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/428/992/992/4289929928144cceb10c28f2174966eb.JPG"><br><br>  The display, it is - the button.  By clicking on it, you can switch between the activity and clock statistics displays. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/09c/0c9/a0a/09c0c9a0a9bf43bcba6570d6e322cc45.JPG"><br><br>  The keychain tracker runs on a battery for up to 8 months.  <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/withings-go.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_medium%3Dtracker%26utm_campaign%3Dwithingsgo">Withings Go</a> works in tandem with the corporate application Withings, where you can also process statistics from other devices of the company. <br><br>  <b>Amazfit</b> <br><br>  The company that introduced <a href="https://ru.aliexpress.com/item/Original-Xiaomi-Amazfit-Moon-Frost-Equator-Smartband-Bluetooth-4-0-IP68-Mi-Band-Fitness-Tracker-For/32698939922.html%3Fspm%3D2114.03010208.3.154.FkSMo1%26ws_ab_test%3Dsearchweb0_0,searchweb201602_5_10065_10068_10136_10137_10138_10060_10062_10141_10056_10055_10054_10059_10099_10103_10102_10096_10148_120_10052_10053_10050_10107_10142_10051_10143_10084_10117_10083_10119_10080_10082_10081_10110_10111_10112_10113_10114_10037_10032_10078_10079_10077_10073_10070_10123_10120_10127_10124_10125-10050_10120,searchweb201603_1,afswitch_1_afChannel,ppcSwitch_4,single_sort_0_default%26btsid%3D2de2c9cb-8c2c-46b6-9db1-4721cd8f4718%26algo_expid%3Db4550f51-c626-4e06-854d-d6acce497f3b-16%26algo_pvid%3Db4550f51-c626-4e06-854d-d6acce497f3b">this tracker</a> makes the Xiaomi smart watch, but proximity to the brand and the frequent mentioning of ‚ÄúXiaomi‚Äù in the title does not help the tracker much. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3a5/c12/06b/3a5c1206b88d43418cadf553c7a19606.png"><br><br>  A smart bracelet is aimed at a female audience: it is made of ceramics, and as a whole it looks very refined.  By its functionality, it even slightly exceeds some gadgets: there is a smart alarm clock.  In addition, he sends notifications of events on a smartphone, counts steps and calories, and also analyzes sleep. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1d8/bc1/e69/1d8bc1e697fb4fb1a923e6a84fca4125.jpg"><br><br>  It is offered in two colors and different mounting options: including wearing Amazfit, you can also wear it as a pendant. <br><br>  <b>Samsung charm</b> <br><br>  <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/samsung-smart-charmy.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_medium%3Dtracker%26utm_campaign%3Dcharm">Samsung Charm</a> can be put on the same line with Amazfit, and, like Withings Go, this is an ‚Äúecho‚Äù of 2016, albeit from a different exhibition - MWC. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5d8/455/584/5d8455584ca245fe8369739f4b432dfa.JPG"><br><br>  The tracker is also addressed to girls and is designed primarily to perform one function: remind about calls and messages.  He does it quite delicately, without sound and vibration, with the help of one of the diode signals that are tuned when connected. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8b4/4a7/a17/8b44a7a175434edd888594544ab8124d.jpg"><br><br>  The application, as you can see, is not very functional: access to notifications and activity statistics through SHealth.  Indeed, it should be noted that girls often throw the phone into a bag, and then listen: ‚ÄúWell, why do you need a phone at all, if you never hear it‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/755/d90/fbb/755d90fbb4bb456198472517c7c12d85.jpg"><br><br>  However, once again it is necessary to repeat that within 10 minutes, while the diode is flashing, it should be noticed with eyes, since neither vibration nor sound Charm does not give. <br><br>  At the same time, it is fair to note that it looks like an ornament, it looks stylish and modern.  The minimalist combination of a thin line of a bracelet and a large stone is now in fashion.  The gadget can work up to 7 days, depending on the intensity of the notification, and for charging - a special small docking station is included.  There is no cable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fe2/2fd/fc6/fe22fdfc6ca84b16a195ff7ef3b58f9d.JPG"><br><br>  Activity will have to follow in the application SHealth, where you can go from the application Charm.  The gadget collects data on the steps and calories consumed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4e5/b46/931/4e5b4693139149a1a1a376306a4bb494.png"><br><br>  <b>Loop 2 from Swarovski</b> <br><br>  Since the <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/medgadgets/blog/225005/">review of the</a> fitness tracker Polar Loop <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/medgadgets/blog/225005/">appeared</a> on Habr√©, the company has released two updates.  First, <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/polar-loop-2.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_medium%3Dtracker%26utm_campaign%3Dloop2">Loop 2</a> appeared. <br><br>  It appeared on the wave of popularity of smart bracelets, and the company decided to also add the ability to receive a notification from a smartphone.  And then Loop 2 got a modification of <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/polar-loop-crys-tal.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_medium%3Dtracker%26utm_campaign%3Dcrystal">Crystal</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7a7/caa/19b/7a7caa19b4964467928d174515f95a61.JPG"><br><br>  Despite the fact that the dimensions of the original Loop are preserved, due to the two Swarovski lines, the bracelet has become more elegant.  At the same time, he retained all the properties of the original bracelet, even decreases as well: by cutting off part of the belt. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5e6/5c7/e22/5e65c7e22d0747389f81589899130b7f.JPG"><br><br>  With the connection of the sports chest strap H7, the bracelet turns into a full-fledged fitness tracker.  It also retains the ability to receive notifications from the smartphone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eb7/3c1/846/eb73c1846070465fa09a3cfce0a24919.gif"><br><br>  <b>Runtastic Moment</b> <br><br>  The selection turned out for the most part "female" and, completing it, not to mention <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/runtastic-moment.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_medium%3Dtracker%26utm_campaign%3Druntastic">Runtastic Moment Fun</a> . <br><br>  In 2015, the company released a line of analog fitness watches with smart features.  One of the models was <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/medgadgets/blog/267696/">already</a> in our blog. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d2a/a45/888/d2aa458888d84437b00aa21730f9a52a.jpg"><br><br>  Despite the fact that all watches by design were quite versatile, Runtastic decided to release a pink version.
