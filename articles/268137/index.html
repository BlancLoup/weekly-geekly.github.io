Or turn on the paranoid and check the protection of their data</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I will not argue for a long time, just give 2 life examples from close people who are faced with authentication problems in the ordinary modern world and a little bit of their conclusions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f87/9dc/2dc/f879dc2dc3dd4f749d961c6d9c4fb36c.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The first two examples are quotes.  I don‚Äôt remember if I removed any swear words, but most likely the quotes are complete. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">The Beeline Story</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  You have not heard about the action "Criminal Beeline?" <br>  Today is the second series! <br>  A month ago, unknown persons received my sim card in Beeline without documents. They tried to open Yandex.Wallet, hacked all mail, had to change all bank cards (can you imagine what it is ??) <br>  The company allegedly conducted an investigation and stated that ‚Äúviolations have been eliminated, the perpetrators are brought in and this will never happen again.‚Äù  I even got 2000 rubles credited to my account as a compensation (! :)) <br>  But‚Ä¶ <br>  The day before yesterday at 6 pm, my sim card was again issued to unknown persons!  And immediately the money was stolen from Yandex with a one-time password.  After spending Saturday evening at Beeline's office, and remembering all the profanity, I replaced the sim card. <br>  The next morning, yesterday, at 12 o'clock in the afternoon, my SIM card was AGAIN issued to unauthorized persons in the city of Yekaterinburg !!! <br>  I again came to the office of Beeline for a new sim card. <br>  And ... After 43 minutes (!!) after that, my card was again issued in the Beeline office to someone, now in the city of Omsk !!! <br>  Given that the system has a ban on issuing a card in all offices of the country and the world, except for one, and then - with the presentation of a passport, driver's license and code word! <br>  I would like to understand - does the management of Beeline want me to live in their office? <br>  What kind of chaos ?!  Over the last 24 hours, they gave out my sim card 3 times to fraudsters without documents, without a code word, without my presence, in different cities of the country! <br>  Although I came to the office, they called the security service, they wrote, it was useless. <br>  And none of the employees had a question - why does the subscriber change the sim card 5 times during the day?  He's an idiot?  Of course not!  Because the company's employees themselves are tied up in the process, so they do not need my passport, a code word, a ban on the issuance system.  Nothing helps!  Whatever you do, whatever protection you put on, Beeline employees issue SIM cards to their accomplices.  Which then get access to electronic wallets, mail and bank accounts. <br>  It seems that in Beeline there is a large criminal grouping, system operators throughout the country issue SIM cards under fraudulent powers of attorney to fraudsters, they open wallets, money is being stabbed.  They say that a girl was recently fired from Beeline, they say that an employee received 2% of the money she received. <br>  Total: I spent the weekend in the Beeline office, two days without a phone, all three mails were hacked - Google, Yandex, Mail, money stolen from the wallet. <br>  They work masterfully: while yesterday I rushed to the Beeline office for the 4th time to change a sim card, these people managed to get new passwords for mail to my number in 20 minutes, go in there and enter new linked phones, backup addresses and even change the control question in one case (!!) <br>  But that epic did not end - by the night yesterday it turned out that the former owner of my number found that his current, already another number, also Beeline, was not working.  When calling the company, he found out that (being in Batumi) he had replaced the sim card yesterday afternoon at ... Bingo!  - Siberian region Beeline!  The same employee that issued my card with a difference in an hour!

      Do you, my friends, understand that the mail of each of you, recovering her password, is tied to the phone?  What do you get passwords from all your internet banks and cards to your number? <br>  That each of you, who is a Beeline subscriber, can also just take the phone away, and then the mail, the wallet and everything else? <br></div></div><br>  The story number two happened to a girl who, ironically, posted the story of Beeline in her Facebook (she and I read the first story). <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Apple ID and everything, everything, everything</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Here a day ago posted a post about hacking cards.  And what do you think? <br><br>  Today I decided to overtake the time, but rather took the subway, so as not to stand in a traffic jam.  I log into the network, connect to the Wi-Fi, it takes 30 seconds for the system window to open, so that I enter the password for AppleID.  I have not entered.  Immediately re-request.  Rejected ... my iPhone rebooted.  And the picture flashed that I need to contact someone to find out how to unlock. <br><br>  Everything immediately fell into place - hacked Apple ID.  A few hours later I contacted Apple technical support.  It turned out that they really hacked.  How - do not say.  OK.  On the restoration took about half an hour. <br><br>  What I needed to do to recover: <br>  1. Answer the control questions of a specialist, provide data <br>  2. Change the password from the mail <br>  3. Go to the mail settings and filter settings to turn off the filter that blocks the receipt of emails from iCloud and similar Apple servers <br><br>  Step three was given to me only after a few more hours.  Since  The mobile version of my mailbox from apple ID did not assume such functionality. <br><br>  I did.  Restored.  BUT!  ALL DATA DRAWN UP!  I was informed that attackers often do this ... <br><br>  OK.  I was upset, but not desperate.  I decided to restore by iCloud.  BUT!  ICLOUD DATA is also STRETCH. <br><br>  OK.  Good.  There is also iTunes!  I turn on the comp.  I went to wash my hands while he was connecting to an Internet ... I‚Äôm coming back - the computer is restarted.  Requires enter a four-digit pin code.  I entered.  Did not fit. <br><br>  I'm starting to panic. <br><br>  Calling Apple again.  Separately, I will say that the specialists of the Russian-speaking support service work perfectly, write down all the comments. <br><br>  In general, I was told that the deal with poppy is more complicated.  And I have to go to the service center with a check, a box, recover for money.  Called.  In an hour I arrived.  I have done for! 6!  minutes and 3k rub. <br><br>  The biggest question was whether the data would remain on it.  For all the new developments there.  I was lucky - the data has not gone away.  Some have no luck ... <br><br>  FOR REFLECTION / RHETORIC QUESTIONS: <br><br>  1. Somehow, people scanned the passwords from the appleID automatically when logged in to the network. <br>  2. Most likely these people were traveling with me in the same car.  (I tried to calculate them visually at once - failed) <br>  3. In the service center and in the call center, they told me NOT TO USE RUSSIAN POSTAL SERVICES.  They are mostly hacked. <br>  4. Put two-level authorization on the site <a href="https://appleid.apple.com/">appleid.apple.com</a> <br>  5. Be sure to back up your iCloud, iTunes. <br>  6. Use different passwords from email and iCloud login. <br>  7. Most likely, it is useless to write statements anywhere and look for the guilty. <br>  8. If you pay money to attackers, they will not restore access to you. <br><br>  Well, what else to say ...?  Do not take the subway, be people, do not spoil the karma.  Share info! <br></div></div><br>  At the expense of the metro, as it turned out later in the conversation, most likely an error.  You can ride, and broke her account, apparently earlier, and this is just a coincidence. <br><br>  And here's another, fresh, today, in which I have already participated. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Mail.ru and AppleID withdrawal</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  He writes a friend under the account of his wife in a general chat: <i>"The guys I have hijacked the apple id.</i>  <i>Call Natasha pliz, otherwise my devices are blocked (("</i> <br>  The phone is available for an incoming call.  Rezvanivayu.  Increased most likely mail to mail.ru, because  Apple ID password was different and complicated. <br>  What was the password from the mail itself does not remember, because  she didn‚Äôt use it personally, and the Apple ID itself was created in priests when buying a used devil‚Äôs phone when (four in the time of four) devils where (in the states).  But by itself, the paranoid and the password was also not 12345 and far from qwerty.  Macbook (bought in states by relatives) and phone are blocked.  Well, there is access to another laptop, through which communication with the outside world was carried out.  With a grief in half, I connected the comrade and Apple support (by mounting, the headset microphone is clamped between the speakers of the headset of the second phone and back as well).  By the way, the apple id was not showing its mail. <br>  The support failed to log in on control issues (there was a case a long time ago), but it was possible on a linked plastic card. <br><blockquote>  They ask for the IMEI of the phone (if the phone is locked and there is no box, IMEI is available on the insert with the SIM card. I did not know), but the serial from the locked computer helped us. </blockquote><br>  The whole process of communication with Apple support took about 30 minutes.  Then they gave the opportunity to restore access to the Apple ID and remove the lock on the phone.  It didn‚Äôt happen right away, and at the time of this writing, the phone is still blocked by pin code (this is another story not relevant).  The point is not even that, the phone and, most likely, the iPad can be unlocked without problems by restoring access to the account.  Problems begin at the stage of blocking computers.  MacBook Pro (according to Apple support) should be carried to a service center or Apple Store.  When I asked if it was possible to take everything from the laptop and reinstall it, they said no.  Apparently the zalochka is hardware. <br>  <b>Anyone have proofs?</b> <br>  Personally, in this situation, I was interested in the need to show a receipt for the equipment.  I've been thinking.  My laptop is 4 years old.  A check during this time will come to naught. Most likely, it is unlikely that I saved it.  And from a friend the situation is complicated by the fact that he bought a laptop as a gift in the states, and then sent it.  They are looking for a check, but most likely it is somewhere there, and the laptop is quite here.  Those.  If the question is fundamental - we get a brick?  No, I like this thing, stole it, but you can't sell it, because  The laptop is locked.  It‚Äôs a pity that you often hear about stolen iPhones, that thieves call later, ask for a pin-code from the phone (if you physically stole it) with the words: ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt return it to you anyway, either throw it away, or unblock it and sell it‚Äù.  Brazenly, but truthfully. <br></div></div><br>  So, these three stories prompted me to write a post on VKontakte and facebook, so that my friends were warned, there are always owners of this or that Apple technology in the tape (alas, I don‚Äôt know how things are in this plan for Android and Windows Phone), maybe someone and do something in advance.  A couple of hours passed, and I know that somehow my other acquaintances faced the problem. <br><br>  <b>Friends, colleagues, turn paranoid for a moment.</b> <br> <code><a href="https://support.apple.com/ru-ru/ht201263"></a> <br>     .      ,     ,   .       ,   .    ? <br> <br>          ‚Äì    . <br>  ,    .
