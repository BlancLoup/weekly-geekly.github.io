  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Autonomous operation of the smartphone: "intelligible" comparative guide</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> There are not so many IT-related information resources on the Web that are as serious as possible when estimating battery life.  Often, even reputable observers are limited to general phrases like "one or two days will work."  And this is despite the fact that I personally immediately rewind articles to the ‚ÄúAutonomous work‚Äù section.  In this question, I am invariably pleased with the Helpix resource, which measures the ‚Äúmobil‚Äù in 14 scenarios, until it is completely discharged.  That is, the test of the duration of the work of even the ‚Äúmeanest‚Äù smartphone takes about 120 (O_O) hours in total.  Measurements are made in an <a href="http://helpix.ru/articles/battery-test.html">updated summary table</a> , which I would like to demonstrate.  In total, the list contains 27 pieces of equipment, including tablets.  Over August-September, Highscreen Omega Q, Alcatel One Touch X'Pop 5035X, Highscreen Alpha R, teXet TM-4072 X-basic and Fly IQ4411 Quad Energie 2 were added. when choosing a smartphone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/916/e7e/f73/916e7ef734a14efe41bc6dee38f9e9d7.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  I will not torment, immediately bring the latest version of the table at the moment.  At the same time, I remembered that somehow I hadn‚Äôt decorated the posts with ‚Äúflesh‚Äù for a long time, so I decided to attach a couple of eye-pleasing to ennoble the text :)

According to the owner of the resource Georgy Kiselev, this indicator is enough for comfortable work in conditions of artificial lighting.  Frankly, before I did not really think about this approach.  After all, observers prefer to set the brightness to maximum, which leads to not quite correct comparative data on smartphones: How much does this ultimately distort the possibility of comparing autonomy information between devices from different sources?  <i>"Strong.</i>  <i>For tens of percent.</i>  <i>Well, if not half as much.</i>  <i>The screen, roughly speaking, "eats" half the battery.</i>  <i>The difference in power consumption of the screen at 50% brightness and 100% brightness can be two times.</i>  <i>And 150 cd / m2 - it can be 30% of the maximum brightness, and 90%,</i> ‚ÄùGeorge explained to me.  And cited a link to another <a href="http://helpix.ru/articles/201303/screens.html">interesting table</a> , which, among other things, shows the real "candela", depending on the installed brightness. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/830/251/2cf/8302512cf40c5458e85e88eff38dace4.jpg"><br><br>  Given the huge amount of work being done, I also could not help but wonder about the problems arising in the process: <i>‚ÄúThe biggest difficulty is measuring the time of work in the telephone mode, because</i>  <i>MegaFon, which I use, has a maximum call time of 50 minutes.</i>  <i>And how to automate testing, so as not to manually call back every 50 minutes, I have not yet invented</i> , ‚Äùsaid George.  It is interesting that sometimes reviews generally bypass the topic of telephone calls.  For example, in the IXBT methodology, only the reading mode, video and 3D games are given.  Or there are trade-offs when the total battery consumption is fixed in the ‚Äúset‚Äù of the tasks performed for 20-30 minutes.  Let's say I am impressed by this approach of the <a href="http://www.x-drivers.ru/blog/alex/111.html">site x-drivers.ru</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/09e/033/2d0/09e0332d0c440e91fe097a8e0abcbfea.jpg"><br><br>  Actually, back to the table of autonomy.  It uses a convenient indicator, "K-factor" - an average indicator of how much better or worse the battery of the device has been compared to the Samsung Galaxy S4.  Of the leading trio, the first two places are in the domestic brand.  About Highscreen Boost and so everyone knows, but I did not like the not very stable operation of the smartphone.  For example, sometimes I completely refused to turn on the camera.  Probably, this is some kind of karma ‚Äî the users I surveyed had no such complaints.  But Highscreen Alpha R frankly pleased - in some places it not only surpasses Boost, but also simply ‚Äútears‚Äù it.  This is despite the fact that the model has a 5-inch Full HD screen and a 4-core MediaTek MT6589 with an ‚ÄúT‚Äù index.  I liked the smartphone as a whole, but the PowerVR SGX 544MP for 1080p is rather weak - in games like Iron Man, Riptide GP2 and Real Racing 3, the performance leaves much to be desired. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/89e/a75/d4a/89ea75d4a14517ac33b2b34817789243.jpg"><br><br>  In my opinion, a reasonable solution in the style of fed wolves and sheep is to install 3,000 mAh batteries.  The phenomenon is still infrequent, but periodically observed.  In the table, the Fly IQ4411 Quad Energie 2 is the ‚Äúthree thousandth‚Äù of the third place. However, an ordinary TFT display, a 5 megapixel camera and only 512 MB of RAM (this is a 4-core processor) is not ice.  In this scenario, 7,990 rubles (the price in the official online store) is somewhat tall. <br><br>  I would like to complete the post with encouraging thematic info guides from the Berlin IFA 2013, but alas, those on the ‚Äúlong-playing‚Äù smartphones have not been found.  Probably, the ‚Äúdelicious‚Äù news is up to the MWC 2014. In the meantime, we‚Äôll follow how the latest news shows itself in the helpless tests of Helpix. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/193670/">https://habr.com/ru/post/193670/</a></p>
