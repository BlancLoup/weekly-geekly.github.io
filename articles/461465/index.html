Unlike detailed heavy settings, only the most general details that convey the atmosphere and uniqueness of the world are prescribed in the surroundings.  Therefore, they are easy to detail, modernize for themselves, mix and modify. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><blockquote>  For many reasons, they become world-walkers.  Someone is driven by curiosity and a thirst for research, someone hopes to gain unprecedented power and authority, someone leads fate and higher powers, someone gets lost and is desperate to find his way home.  Many dangers await the pioneers on this path: a hostile environment, strange metamorphoses, other customs and rules.  In my work, I tried to collect all the most useful information about the measurements known to me.  They will come in handy when your time comes to embark on a grand journey through the worlds ... </blockquote><br>  What is more useful surroundings - they help to build a game on travels between worlds, offer many interesting dimensions, where the heroes can lead the next portal found.  Often, an adventure begins in one of the more standard worlds, so that later the story path leads the characters to new horizons of other people's dimensions and the in-game story is expanded with new problems and challenges.

      The global concept of the world order is as follows: there is a certain Terra world (essentially planet Earth), into which, at the metaspace level, a certain object crashed - a Spire, shaped like a giant spear and containing slices inside itself, which are in a certain way arranged the Entourage worlds.  After the collision, the Abyss formed, a conflict of two worlds occurs in it - the Spire absorbs Terra, building it into its structure, transforming the Entourage.  Terra, in turn, opposes merging, generating reflections and fragments of various worlds in the Abyss. <br><br>  The main world-wide conflict is between the Agents of Terra, Spawn Spawn, and the Architect.  The agents of Terra are people who have penetrated into the Abyss or the Spire, they somehow contribute to the destruction of the Spire and the Abyss, but the main idea that drives them is to save Terra and return back.  They are opposed by Spire Spawn - special people and nonhumans who appeared inside the Entourage as a response of the world itself to the invaders who visited it. <br><br>  The third party stands apart - the Spire Architectite, these are powerful creatures that pursue their goals and are related to the construction of the Spire itself and the creation / destruction / modification of its layers. <br><br>  Meanwhile, life inside the Entourage flows according to its own laws, many creatures may not even suspect the existence of other worlds.  Even those traveling in dimensions do not have to run into Agents or Architect in their travels. <br><br>  So, let‚Äôs finally go on a journey.  And our first stop will be in the world of tortoise-cities crawling along the lava ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0q/5_/b1/0q5_b1b_ddqvbrptu875j5vqekq.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  Bravura reverse </h3><br><blockquote>  Butterfly, butterfly <br>  Flying into the wind <br>  You could be sure of it <br>  That's no place to begin <br><br>  A-ha - ‚ÄúButterfly, butterfly‚Äù <br></blockquote><br>  Vast spaces are flooded with red-hot lava.  Here and there, naked lifeless rock fragments come from it.  Many channels cut through the lava surface, Mor flows through them - a mysterious liquid that is considered sacred. <br><br>  It is not known where the streams of Mora originate, but they all converge at one point.  Here, drops of Mora ascend into the dark skies for several kilometers above the Crossroads, where the blood-red five-pointed star, Yazma, hangs. <br><br>  Giant tortoise creatures - <b>gourmets wander through the</b> expanses of this hot world.  Although their skin is practically not afraid of lava, these huge creatures experience the unpleasant sensation of swimming in uncharted places.  For this reason, gourmets usually prefer to move along already laid paths where an enzyme secreted by their skin has accumulated. <br><br>  On the back, each giant carries a bizarre ligature of architectural structures.  Buildings, columns, arches and bridges grow directly from the massive shell.  Here lives the <b>Zen</b> people, humanoid creatures with huge stone limbs that are separated from the body and fly next to the owner, obeying his mental commands. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kn/or/tx/knortxzvul0vdn2qmw7lhdq5vkk.jpeg"><br>  <i>Omar, the high priest of the Zen people.</i>  <i>This race appeared in my games after he himself played at one of the role-playing sessions by a character who mentally levitated huge stone limbs in front of him.</i>  <i>Initially, they appeared in one of the settings, as a race of aliens whose ship crashed in swamps and caused some mutations among the local flora and fauna.</i>  <i>In the world of Bravura Reverse, I decided to show earlier generations of these creatures when they did not yet possess technology and did not conquer space.</i> <br><br>  Sometimes gourmets stop at a watering place, drinking a certain amount of liquid from the Mora rivers.  Only seven priests have access to the clear Mora, which enters the pool of the inner temple, which is located in the head of every giant.  The priest is the highest power - he is the voice of the gourmet, as well as his drover.  The names of the priests are the names of the giants they control: Omar, Yurit, Navi, Rimer, Arun, Tarnus, Unpen. <br><br>  Contact with pure Mor is fatal for most Zen Chi - even legends are silent about what can happen when the sacred fluid comes into contact with the ordinary people who inhabit the backs of giants.  Only the priests are not afraid of Pestilence - special royal <b>colonies of ju</b> , representing a swarm of microscopic creatures, live in their bodies. <br><br>  When the priest drinks from the pool, the Pest that gets inside it is neutralized and the decay products enter the priest‚Äôs lacrimal glands.  One tear that fell into the pool with More is enough, so that after two days all of it turns blue and turns into a <b>fiesta</b> - divine nectar. <br><br>  The resulting fiesta is distributed to the inhabitants of the gourmet during the festivities.  Its use causes deep euphoria and, at the same time, dulling of feelings.  In addition, the blue liquid is very addictive.  Not all zen chi like this, but most use fiesta anyway.  They do not realize that, together with their dependence on liquids, they completely lose their will; if they hear the voice of their priest. <br><br>  Although it seems that the architectural structures grow from the gourmet carapace on their own, in fact, they are erected by architects barely visible to the eye.  The giant colony ju circulates over the entire surface of the giant, patching up damage and constructing new tiers of buildings according to only one known plan.  This colony is a sacred legacy that must never be lost.  Without June, gourmets begin to collapse: buildings are strewed, small pieces of the shell break off.  But the worst thing that can happen is the destruction of the giant‚Äôs core, in which case the gourmet will go crazy, refuse to drink Pestilence and begin chaotic-convulsive wanderings, a kind of dance.  This effect is irreversible and, worst of all, it is transmitted to other giants that are nearby.  History has preserved several cases when there was a mass death of crazy gourmets, they are known as Carnivals.  Many giants perished in this way, millions of zen chi died with them, unimaginable quantities of ju were lost forever.  The next Carnival may be the last. <br><br>  The current situation is deplorable - only one large colony of workers of ju has survived, which is transmitted by priests from one gourmet to another.  When the time is right, the giants meet in contact with the horny growths that are located on their heads.  The priests perform the ritual, after which they fly in a dense swarm at the giant receiving them.  This is the only way to survive by exchanging the colony according to the established schedule. <br><br>  Some time ago, Tonfa (then there were eight gourmets) went against the others and at the appointed time did not give up ju.  The priest of the eighth gourmet was driven by the desire for personal salvation.  Indeed, in the stories it is told that the star Yazma is also a gourmet, the first to complete his evolution and ascend into the sky, continuing to develop in order to return in a new quality.  For this insolence, Tonfa was destroyed by the combined sound attack of Yurit and Omar (an ancient secret weapon requiring a huge amount of fiesta).  The resonance force of the giant tore into pieces.  To this day, blackened fragments are found in the lava.  Part of ju was lost along with Tonfa and his death is an important lesson for all those remaining. <br><br>  The colony exchange has one negative property: insignificant losses of july occur.  When a colony is recalled, single creatures may become involved in an uninterrupted cycle and disobey the team, and subsequently lose touch with the swarm.  This rather unpleasant circumstance is compounded by the fact that after some time such isolated jus begin to regress.  The cloning mechanism starts: july they begin to reproduce degenerate versions of themselves, forming a black, viscous mass - <b>rot</b> .  This action damages the gourmet, as the rot corrodes the architectural structures and grows like a tumor.  Among other things, rot produces monsters - this is a kind of continuation of the update program that was sewn up in June, but launched with the opposite priority: creating independent aggressive isolated devices, instead of building a common unified architectural pattern.  Inhabitants of gourmets have to fight with rot, finding centers of distribution and fighting with its creatures. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rg/rn/ym/rgrnymq6ojqqxq0zgnmlgldas1m.jpeg"><br>  <i>Gerda (zen chi chronodiver) and Smumu (hermetic droid).</i>  <i>An alien heroine from the world where the ship of the high-tech zen chi crashed in swamps.</i>  <i>Thanks to the ability of chronodiving, she can plunge into other eras (that is, she can appear in other settings, like a guest from another time).</i> <br><br>  Side by side with zen chi live small fluffy creatures, a kind of pet: <b>a-chi</b> .  These creatures are like snow-white squirrels, with missing front paws.  At the same time, their tail is very mobile, it consists of many fluffy strong threads, and in its functions completely replaces the missing forelimbs and even surpasses them.  Above the back of each ah-chi, two plates connected with him are floating, in the usual state they are folded together.  Obeying the mental commands of the animal, its plates can move apart and rotate at an incredible speed, turning into propeller blades.  Thanks to this ability, ah-chi are free to fly wherever they want. <br><br>  Both Zen Chi and Ah Chi do not have reproductive functions, and in addition they do not age (although their memory is short and does not cover the entire life period).  The same applies to gourmets and ju.  Apparently all of these creatures were constructed by someone in time immemorial. <br><br>  Rumor has it that the luminescence of the Yazma from the time of its ascension has changed four times and now there is a final, fifth stage of its rebirth.  The return of the first giant is approaching: the unknown scares, but nevertheless Yazma must bring with it a huge amount of ju and this is a glimmer of hope.  However, will the Last Carnival come faster than this event? <br><br>  And we leave the first dimension and head further into the vertical world of hermit creators ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hs/sk/vx/hsskvxjjqw0ok4hjnz4qkb3sbpi.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  Axis thesis </h3><br>  In the midst of the vast sea of ‚Äã‚Äãthunderclouds, a region of darkness is hidden, in which the outlines of a huge black column appear, which seems to have no top or bottom.  Once close, you can see that this endless pillar is not stone, as it might seem, but consists of bundles of heavy-duty metal welded together.  At different heights, the black metal surface is covered with growths of pink ice, it is there that life is warming. <br><br>  Local residents call their house the core.  On the pink ice terraces you often meet <b>schematites</b> - mechanical creatures, and in the airspace of the Rod angels, dragons, cloudy rays, and other flying creatures live comfortably. <br>  But not everyone likes to live outside, many Rod natives spend most of their lives inside it - behind the doors of pink ice. <br><br>  You will find such doors only where ice growths cover the Core.  And maybe you won‚Äôt find it - so well it can be disguised.  But it is not enough to find the door - it still needs to be opened, choosing a special approach.  Specialists in hacking pink doors in this world at a great price, but even the greatest of them are unlikely to be able to open all the doors of the Hinge. <br><br>  Inside each pink door there is a separate subspace, the personal world of one of the inhabitants.  Usually these worlds are very small, but it all depends on the personality of the owner, and his "strength".  There can be hidden vast spaces filled with forests, mountains, palaces, clouds, the sea, anything else.  In addition, local laws of nature can act within the world. <br><br>  The most famous public door, Glu, is located in the Bends area (a place on the Shaft where he makes three noticeable spiral turns).  Glu is a huge elven kingdom, spread out among the mountain ranges.  The second largest open world for everyone is located half a kilometer lower - this is Bunta Urya, a technogenic atoll controlled by schematites. <br><br>  If you climb two kilometers from the Glu, you can notice a large accumulation of ice - lace from ice looping paths diverging in all directions.  This is a huge noisy fair where you can find many interesting things.  No one noticed the doors in these places, but experienced magicians know that there is no pink ice without doors, because ice is the breath of a world that seeps into reality. <br><br>  Above the fair you will see a bright light, dispersing the darkness.  This is the light of Axiom - the great lamp, which is now guarded by the angels of the Ice Web.  That was not always, and it will not always be that way.  Axiom has changed owners many times, bringing its radiance to different parts of the Rod.  For many years, the Axiom was hidden inside the worlds, and outside everything was plunged into impenetrable darkness illuminated by rare flashes of lightning. <br><br>  <i>This entourage is included in one of the Strings - these are different groups of dimensions, united by any place, creature or powerful object that has the same name in all these worlds.</i>  <i>In this case, the world belongs to the String of the Axiom, that is, in other worlds of this group there are various reflections, manifestations of the local lamp.</i> <br><br>  The basis, the heart of each world is its Thesis.  A special stone located somewhere inside it.  Huge or small, sheltered from prying eyes or put on public display.  It is the Thesis that gives the owner the opportunity to create his own world, but has its own specifics and its power is not unlimited.  Which does not prevent talented masters from benefiting even from the limitations of their Thesis. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gf/tb/dt/gftbdtomm0gjxvloulrnyjm9pha.jpeg"><br>  <i>Integrated Grail - One of the Great Architectural Tools</i> <br><br>  Some Theses are quite generous to those who come to look at them and through touch share their gifts and abilities.  In the same Glu, you will meet a statue of the elven goddess Thira, with an azure stone in her hands.  Touching the stone, you can gain knowledge of Elven writing and speech, and possibly a more significant gift. <br><br>  While the Thesis is inside the native world, it is impossible to kidnap, but it is very attached to its owner.  Some creatures sold their Theses, and personally carried them out.  Now they are forced to roam the Rod, seeking shelter.  Without the Thesis, the world first becomes icy, and after some time it can begin to collapse. <br><br>  Another Thesis can be destroyed, but it‚Äôs not easy - to destroy one Thesis you need another Thesis, and sometimes several.  Destroying, the Thesis does not disappear without a trace - fragments or at least dust should remain.  Outside the Hinge, these pieces of the Thesis are transformed into magical things, which, however, have no power inside the hinges of the Hinge.  Entire Theses, on the contrary, have the power to partially change reality within any world, but much weaker than their own Thesis. <br><br>  There are legends about the existence of the main, first-born Thesis - the Complex Grail.  It is hidden somewhere inside or outside the Rod and its owner is able to rewrite the whole world from scratch. <br><br>  Next in line is the next world, before entering, get yourself a guest password ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wm/3b/bm/wm3bbmzndqyvmimddtxuyaedhkg.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  Gridsphere </h3><br>  Welcome to digital reality, inside a giant sphere, on the surface of which amazing local inhabitants move - programs.  This is a world of clear lines, smooth surfaces, mirror reflections, alternately flickering lights and droning streams of light. <br><br>  All residents of the virtual geofront (or Tsifrosfera) belong to one of three common families: suspicious <b>Tellins</b> , inventive <b>Nixu</b> and extravagant <b>Idro</b> . <br><br>  The Tellins consider themselves the highest community and inhabit the upper part of the geofront, their main sector is called the Plaza.  These programs very responsibly guard the borders of their privileged sector and are unfriendly to strangers. <br><br>  Niksu live in one of the two lower halves of the geofront, in the Hub sector.  This is an unpretentious folk of diplomats and reformers who are trying to build a common system for managing the life of the sphere.  Representatives of other families cannot function normally in this sector, and in addition, the surface of the geofront in this place is not subject to change. <br><br>  The unstable Aidro zone occupies the remaining lower part of the geofront, here you will find a lot of wild sectors constantly conflicting with each other, without any unified centralized force.  In these places, the surface of the geofront has a low degree of protection, which allows programs to drill niches in the geofront and thereby produce a valuable resource - <b>like</b> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/g1/7s/wn/g17swnlc74mf88pgt3mjjpty6gs.jpeg"><br>  <i>Nay3x - Troyan class program from the Tellin family</i> <br><br>  The entire surface of the geofront consists of barely noticeable rectangular plates.  If you find a way to break such a plate, then a cubic structure will fly out from the inside and either disappear or turn red and decrease several times.  This is what it is like - an alternately flickering cube of irregular shape, a unique currency-material of this world, from which you can collect various objects, and then disassemble it back without loss.  Any program can store an almost unlimited supply of yakos in a special yak-receiver, which is most often located on the surface of the palm.  To get a resource on your personal account, just touch a free yako, or touch someone else's yak-receiver through the exchange procedure. <br><br>  In this digital world, each program is accompanied by its name - a blue text floating next to its carrier.  This is how one of the mysterious functions that regulate and control the life of the digital universe manifests itself - <b>Anima, the junior identification function</b> .  There are a great many of such regulators; even a program of the Catalog class is unlikely to list all of you, here are just a few of them: <br><br>  <b>Render is the main function of the graphical representation</b> , which is responsible for displaying all virtual objects, <br><br>  <b>Barcode is a senior identification function</b> that assigns a special secret code to each object, <br><br>  <b>Segment - a function of working with hyper-memory</b> , ensuring the preservation, accumulation and transformation of various knowledge, <br><br>  <b>Discrete - a navigation function</b> that tracks the coordinates of objects and makes sure that two objects do not occupy the same place, <br><br>  <b>Magnet is a proto-gravity function</b> that draws objects to the nearest point on the surface of the geofront, <br><br>  <b>Junk is a function of clearing hyper-memory</b> , annihilating information garbage. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ns/6j/05/ns6j057lyiwgidddnpevytj21lc.jpeg"><br>  <i>Ferment - 529, a program of the class "Cryptograph" from the Niksu family</i> <br><br>  Different classes of programs have unique personal keys to some functions, allowing them to use these functions in a non-standard way.  So, for example, a key is available to the <b>Proxy</b> class that hides its name or even its identifier.  The <b>Cryptograph</b> class turns its name into a weapon - it can pick it up and use it like a sword.  The <b>Trojan</b> class can spoil other people's names, and the <b>Anti</b> - <b>Virus</b> class can restore.  The <b>graph editor</b> class is able to change the appearance of the program or even make it invisible.  The program does not select its class immediately, but only after a certain number of cycles.  And if a change of family for programs is not a frequent but real phenomenon, then a change of class is an impossible event.  For this reason, programs are careful when choosing a class. <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A network of green translucent </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">lenses is</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> scattered throughout the geofront </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">, which allows you to instantly move to other known lens programs, establishing a channel for the opto-transition. To use the lens, you need to know its password (if you have any difficulties, then look for a familiar </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Code editor</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> ), and also comply with its class requirements (sorry, Troyan, but you are on the black list with almost all lenses). </font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ut/m1/o8/utm1o8ububp26aj427hkosmfuuu.jpeg"><br> <i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Z''O program class "Graph Editor" from the Niksu family</font></font></i> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the very center of the sphere, somewhere high above the heads of the inhabitants, a large symbol of a circle shattered by a line shines. Every 12 hours, the symbol cyclically changes its color - from red to yellow, from yellow to green, and then in the reverse order. It is possible to destroy the geofront and mine only during the red symbol, and the opto-transition lenses function only when the symbol is green. </font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/av/-b/w4/av-bw4md7h3nbl6tpst3tei6-pu.png"><br> <i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A group of local characters from one of the games on Tsifrosfera.

The first settlers discovered in these places the ruins of some ancient civilization, and over time they built their own homes in the middle of the ruins. When the radiance of the white sickle does not obscure the clouds and the desert wind weakens, then the breath of the Glass Sea is heard to the inhabitants. Its amazing dark green waters are rock solid and just as motionless. But this is only at first glance - the sea lives its own life. It breathes and moves, albeit in its incredibly slow rhythm.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Large and small islands covered with lush vegetation are very often scattered along the smooth sea surface. The locals have settled some of them, but it is dangerous to move too far from the city, because it is from the sea that the threat comes to these quiet places. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Yes, the dark armies of creepy monsters, led by evil lords, raid from time to time on the seaside. These are crazy fiends of hell, with a bloodthirsty look and a frightening grin. These are inconceivable creatures, and they are terrible, just terrifying ... delicious! Oh, how amazingly tasty all these avocadlings, soup elemental, strawberry pancakes, repo golems, tortosaurs, coffee makers, chocopteryx and zombie jelly are delicious!</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Defenders of the city bravely repel the raids, at the same time replenishing supplies of food, but they are unlikely to understand who they are fighting with and how it can all end. They could be told by those who erected an ancient city here in time immemorial, but those are no longer there. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Rather, almost none. In the secret, invisible to the ordinary mortal folds of reality, the powerful souls of these ancient creatures, the people of Silicon Whale, remained. Weathered, tormented, weak, but they survived here in the middle of the ruins. </font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rt/pp/kz/rtppkzvykrzhxdncdvb5jsxd82u.jpeg"><br> <i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">On the shore of the Glass Sea, the</font></font></i> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Souls of the ancients were able to find new carriers from among the inhabitants of the Seaside - they did not understand their language, but in some way related souls to them. These chosen ones considered themselves enlightened and penetrated the secrets of the spirit world. </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Shamans</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- so they began to be called in the city. Although shamans were able to adopt from souls only a small fraction of their former strength and knowledge, but now the city probably has a chance of survival. A special gift that appeared among the shamans allows them to see a reflection on the surface of the Glass Sea, in which the Taidenica clearly emerges - folds of reality hidden from prying eyes. They tried to transfer this property to others by organizing a special school - Assemble. The experiments were unsuccessful, but it turned out that shamans can enchant sea glass, and through them Taemnica was opened even to the townsfolk - they began to see the outlines of the long-destroyed structures of antiquity, their own souls and strange glowing dust.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A great many enchanted fragments were created in Assemble and distributed to the people. And active shamans over time perfected the enchantment, trying to make other wonders of the Taidenica more accessible. Now, the owners of magic fragments can access not only the observation of hidden reality, but also the ability to store ‚Äúglazed images‚Äù and make notes on the unsteady ‚Äúbottom of the sea‚Äù. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Another fun that locals are passionate about is collecting </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">informons</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">. These are small luminous symbols that fly in the air and are visible only to the owner of the shard or shaman. Many residents of the Seaside are looking for informers and catching them with their shrapnel, like a butterfly net. Whoever caught it was great. Shamans feel that informons are something very important, but they still cannot understand what exactly. These particles themselves follow the shaman, are attracted to him, obey his gestures.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Lords of evil could answer this question. The Pale Redya and the black Hrerim, who, for the happiness of the seaside inhabitants, are at war with each other. Making raids on the coast, they take the souls of the fallen, as well as the nascent informons. Then, returning to their islands, they brew new armies from the collected material. While Khremim hopes for the inexorable growth of his loyal army, which sooner or later will crush the coastal city, the prudent Redya relies on the juice of evil, which penetrates the inhabitants of the seaside along with the eaten pieces of the defeated enemy. The juice of evil accumulates in the body and one day they themselves will come into her possession, to glorify their dark pale mistress. Not long for them.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Oh yes, another small problem constantly confuses under the feet of the evil lords - Cron the Firstborn, the greatest god of darkness, the most ill-tempered and most powerful, but, here is a misfortune, enclosed in the body of a small snail. Wow, how angry he is, how damn evil and gloomy. He is going to destroy this thousand times disgusting him world. Immediately ... as soon as it crawls. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Oh, how much blood has already spoiled the Lords this indefatigable immortal creature that they just did not come up with in order to prevent him from performing the cunning ritual of the day of judgment, to slow its progress. And the snail creeps and crawls towards its goal, not going to stop in front of any obstacles, no matter how long it takes.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Meanwhile, the city lives its own life. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Assembly members are working on stronger charms, the Great Shaman goes into meditation, trying to understand the language of ancient souls, the inhabitants reflect the attacks of monsters, amuse themselves with magic glasses and are optimistic about the future. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And although the concentration of the juice of evil in the bodies of the defenders of the Seaside is increasing, some restless ancient souls were able to join precisely these carriers, touched by evil. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There are still very few of them, but among the people they are already treated with some caution. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">They were called </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">mixers</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , for special abilities that allow you to transfer objects of the material world to Taemnitsa and vice versa, to combine real and visible realities. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Once upon a time, evil lords also began with this ...</font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ud/vz/op/udvzoplz41n7jlyuanbtvxue6ue.jpeg"><br><br><h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Dayend </font></font></h3><br>  <i>Note: This entourage belongs to a group of worlds united by an entity with the name Axiom.</i> <br><br>  The midst of the sultry Day.  A majestic city filled with deafening peace.  The air is filled with deathly silence.  Deserted streets, uneven walls, tall towers with narrow windows-holes, overhanging stone vaults, an echoing and clean pavement, an uncomfortable kind of building, on the horizon an interweaving of metal structures and greenery. <br><br>  A huge empty Maze City, always bathed in the light of the sun.  Eternal noon reigns here.  Not a single shadow.  You will not meet a single shadow on empty streets.  There is nowhere to hide from the omnipresent piercing light.  And emptiness.  A lonely enveloping emptiness that penetrates somewhere inside.  With horror, you begin to understand that there is nowhere to go from her. <br><br>  Around not a soul.  It seems like a moment ago someone was over there, around the bend.  But no, it seemed.  Maybe this is for the best, very often a meeting with someone in the City does not end with anything good.  It is better not to approach local plants either - from a distance they appear green, but nearby you can see how darkness flows through them.  This is hardly a good sign.  Moreover, these are strange statues.  Shady plants always grow close to fancifully curving stone statues, sometimes braiding them. <br><br>  In a strange way, this world has an impact on many others.  Usually, everything starts unnoticed, life goes on, nothing unusual happens.  Is it that the usual order of things will break the short visit of some strange alien with rolling eyes or a nervous tic. <br><br>  And suddenly, the inexplicable happens.  One of the pages in your favorite book turns completely yellow.  The glass vase on the window turns yellow, along with the flower standing in it.  Stains of incomprehensible yellowness appear on the back of a pet.  At first, all this only seems, and looking closely you find that everything is in order.  But after some time, the yellow color returns.  And this time does not pass. <br><br>  At this stage, strange yellowing is usually not given importance.  However, the process begins to progress.  Shuffling a deck of cards, you notice that one of them is yellow.  The mirror and glasses turn yellow.  Your chair and desk.  Cupboard.  Clothes turn yellow.  This is where panic usually begins ... <br><br>  The panic intensifies when you notice that there is something wrong with the rest of the world: others cease to recognize you, it becomes more and more difficult to move around and interact with various objects.  Meanwhile, the yellowing process accelerates and gradually everything around becomes yellow, including living beings. <br><br>  In the end, the yellowness that has flooded the whole space gradually fades away, along with your usual environment.  You find yourself under the scorching sun of the Day, in one of the transitions-labyrinths of the City.  The new sacrifice that this crazy world has drawn into itself. <br><br>  For others, everything happens differently.  They have long felt that their home is not at all for them.  They dream of other horizons.  They dream completely unimaginable dreams.  These are special creatures - potential chronodivers that are able to be transported through eras, trying to physically go to other times closer to their nature.  But this special gift makes them extremely vulnerable to the Day, so hungry for the living. <br><br>  Beginning chronodivers easily fall into the trap set by them, once instantly transporting to the Day forever.  During one of their usual walks, they suddenly experience a feeling of loss.  Something has changed.  Where did all the sounds disappear?  Around the familiar houses and streets that at the same time seem like strangers.  Why is everything around so empty and quiet, where is everyone?  No answer.  From now on, an unfamiliar City around you. <br><br>  Sooner or later, those who are here simply go crazy, having never met anyone.  But even without falling into madness, it is very easy to simply die of hunger, because in the City there is neither food nor food.  However, some do not mind having a meal with fellow sufferers.  You can stretch out for some time by eating the flowers of shady plants, but their juice will gradually turn you into stone.  In a word, the life (and rather its end) of the local inhabitants is rather bleak. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/z1/wv/ff/z1wvfftaozgc4mqdqbfxf4r1e-w.jpeg"><br><br>  The City has an unpleasant surprise for travelers-savers who accidentally looked into this world.  Staying longer than 6 hours, they lose their ability to move between worlds, the same applies to moving objects. <br><br>  Somewhere inside this dimension, one great thing is hidden, the main local attraction is the Axiom.  This is a large perfectly smooth ruby, charming those who look at it, and subtle pulsating.  This item is very dangerous, as it instantly annihilates anyone who takes it.  Pure souls, disappearing, turn into feathers, sparkling pollen, rose petals.  Dark, corrupted creatures turn into ashes, dust or a pile of autumn leaves.  If the creature concerning the Axiom is already largely insane, then it will only get a burn. <br><br>  When the Axiom destroys the one who touched her, she herself goes straight to the native world of that creature.  Being there, in a foreign dimension, Axiom fills the space around him with vibes of madness.  This part of the terrain begins to gradually turn yellow and fall out of the surrounding world: it becomes increasingly difficult for local creatures (and at a certain moment at all) to cross the border between the area captured by Axiom and other areas.  When the transformation finally ends, Axiom returns to his world, along with a torn piece of the alien, forever joining it to the general drawing of the City. <br><br>  Axiom was once located in the very center of the City before being disturbed for the first time.  Now no one will tell you where this center is and how to get there.  However, it exists, surrounded by thickets of shadow plants.  Here is a small pond of darkness, in the middle of which a creature flounders, captured by tentacles coming from somewhere from the depths.  It asks those passing by for help, you just have to go into the pond and cut off the tentacles holding it.  And although this speech sounds very plaintive and sincere, it is not worth stepping into the black pond under any circumstances.  What follows is a thousand times worse than death ... <br><br>  While Axiom is absent in his native world, the heavy breathing of madness is weakening, and the creatures locked in the City have a ghostly chance of salvation: the probability of opening a random portal leading to these places increases by several times, and the forces that return here are peace-walkers and carrying objects. <br><br>  However, you should not think that you were saved.  Anyone who has stayed here for longer than a day will never be the same, because a prohibitive dose of madness has already leaked somewhere very far into the soul itself.  And no matter how long the road measured to this soul is - from now on it is a one-way road.  One day everything will turn yellow ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gr/aq/wc/graqwc33pomrztfxn-1bxw53w6o.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  Charmborn </h3><br>  The dual world in which lives are written. <br><br>  Under the blizzard clouds, consisting of the purest fluffy snow, lies the flowering earth - the <b>Code</b> , as the locals call it.  These are vast expanses of water occupied by a network of islets converging into each other.  It is sometimes difficult to understand where one islet ends and another begins - almost all of them are interconnected by twisting arches of rocks and bizarre piles of stone. <br><br>  Flocks of small motley birds fly over the islets, around lush flowers.  They are quite curious, but not particularly shy.  These creatures have an interesting feature - each bird can shout a single word.  Rather, it will be said that each one produces a unique set of sounds that is perceived by any listener as a certain word in his native language. <br><br>  The coastal cliffs are full of caves, where birds rarely fly - only for the period of bad weather.  Once inside such a cave, you will notice that you are in a small room connected by various corridors and stairs to other similar rooms.  Almost every room in these labyrinths, cutting through the entire space inside the rocky conglomerates of the Code, is piled with stacks of manuscript books. <br><br>  But who inhabits the Arch, besides the birds?  Planeswalkers.  These are the most diverse creatures that have fallen into this world after death in some new quality.  Not every dead planeswalker is reborn here, but those who were drawn into the Charmborn can no longer go to some other world, even through an open portal.  Until they find a book.  Or a shell.  A very special book or shell in which their own life is recorded. <br><br>  It should be noted that an unimaginable number of books were collected on the Code and in each one's life was recorded.  And not just written down - new lines are written themselves, without stopping, if, of course, the creature is still alive.  In countless rooms, the lives of all fairly rational creatures that live in all known entourage worlds are written every second.  Some books open two-way passages to secret dungeons full of books.  You cannot get into these secret places otherwise. <br><br>  Where to look for books is understandable.  But where to find shells?  They filled the rooms inside the rocks of the <b>Lagoon</b> - the water world, which is located under the Arch, and, to some extent, is its distorted reflection.  For local residents, gravity is directed in the opposite direction.  They can breathe water, but not air.  They also swim in the air, and not in the water.  High above their heads, in the dark depths, they see a slightly moving cluster of red algae.  In the midst of bright inflorescences, cheerful flocks of small fish glide along openwork corals.  What makes them remarkable - at times, a specific combination of symbols flashes on the scales of each, which are perceived by the observer as one of the words he knows. <br><br>  Here, in the underwater Lagoon, there are exactly the same caves in the rocks, but stuffed with a pile of musical shells.  They also recorded the lives of living creatures, but in the form of music that can be heard by bringing the shell closer to the ears.  The shell spiral twists slowly and slowly and the pattern grows on its surface.  Unlike books, life sounds of beings in the highest degree are emotional in shells.  Portals to various worlds are hidden in some special shells, however, only those planes who came to Charmborn on their own and were not revived can use them. <br><br>  Spending time in search of the container of their lives, the explorers become more and more illusive.  Rare of them manage to find a personal shell or a book.  For these lucky ones, the find turns into a portal, transporting them to their home world.  However, during the transition, the entire memory of the world-walker about being in this strange world is erased.  Another way to return is if the planeswalker is somehow resurrected, but the chance of success is small, and the ritual of resurrection will definitely not work if it was performed outside the homeworld of the planeswalker. <br><br>  One of the dangers for the creatures gathered here, as well as for all the inhabitants of other worlds, is that the water border between the Arch and the Lagoon begins to fluctuate from time to time.  Or the Lagoon begins to flood the caves of the Arch, and the books stored there are wet.  Or the Code drains the labyrinths of the Lagoon, which is detrimental to shells - they dry out and collapse.  All this leads to the fact that the creatures associated with these shells and books - die. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ma/ev/q4/maevq47ycrfspomo7uezmv59cdq.jpeg"><br>  <i>Numbers</i> <br><br>  There is another force in this world that monitors the order - collective numbers, organic numbers, or in abbreviated form K.R.O.N.  These are large serpentine creatures that soar freely around the Code and Lagoon, not obeying the gravitational fields of both worlds.  Sometimes the numbers fly in a flock, but are often divided.  Each such creature is part of a single mind, which was once designed long ago by Architects. <br><br>  Numbers play an important role in maintaining the water border in a moderate range.  They know the causes of these violations - the border changes when in some of the worlds-entourage there is an imbalance between the number of good and evil deeds committed by its inhabitants.  In order to eliminate this imbalance, K.R.O.N.  they turn for help to the peacekeepers imprisoned here, collecting special detachments from them. <br><br>  Silent numbers use the birds of the Code or the fish of the Lagoon to communicate with the planes.  The thing is that being under special mental influence K.R.O.N.  flocks of these creatures form an already meaningful stream of words.  Different birds sound in the desired sequence or various fish are lit in a special order.  Almost all planes of peace agree to participate in the restoration of balance, as they are personally interested in maintaining their reservoir of life.  In addition, after completing missions, they gain the ability once a day to change their affiliation with one of the parts of Charmborn'a to the opposite.  This is accompanied by a change in the direction of gravity for a given creature, as well as other related effects (the possibility of breathing in one environment and swimming in another change places). <br><br>  When the water border begins to change markedly, then the numbers plunge the members of the special squad touching them into an amazing dream.  In this dream, the planes are transported to the world where the balance between light and darkness has been disturbed.  In fact, in that world, it‚Äôs not they who appear, but their analogues - controlled material projections.  To solve the problem, projections must perform a certain amount of evil or good deeds, thereby restoring the broken ratio. <br><br>  Numbers are especially appreciated by expert peace-makers - those who are capable of great evil deeds, or those whose kindness knows no bounds.  Perhaps, in other conditions, the members of special detachments would be irreconcilable enemies and rivals, but here they are forced to work together. <br><br>  After the mission is completed - the water border returns to normal, until the next incident.  While the planes were sleeping, K.R.O.N.  studied them, getting bits of information about where those should look for their books or shells.  Having shared this knowledge, the numbers usually fly away for a short rest - to white snowy clouds, or to a plexus of red algae.  Time will pass and they will return in order to again be on guard of the universal balance. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ve/l5/bj/vel5bjg9zbttqlwpgrbeshlqdb8.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  Trihorn </h3><br>  In a special space, between the worlds of Spire, unusual regions occasionally come across.  One of these will be discussed.  This is a small island of a mysterious civilization, invisible to Architects and inaccessible to any incoming teleportation. <br><br>  Trihorn is the remains of a huge three-horned monster, resting in the midst of a world-wide void.  Strange creatures live here, representatives of the <b>mirage</b> race.  Their resemblance to people ends with the fact that they have a head and two hands.  Legs of mirages are replaced by a column of mobile fluid biomass.  The color of the skin of mirages is most often gray or blue.  Their heads are crowned with specific half-helmets, half-masks, ingrown into the flesh. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/e7/s-/6h/e7s-6heory6efex14ac2vmvrizc.jpeg"><br>  <i>Enigma, miragohods from the race of mirages</i> <br><br>  The insides of a huge monster, a haven of mirages, are structured as follows: the body is a maze of several levels of dungeons.  At the lower levels, literally at every dead end, a black oily <b>bourne</b> oozes from the walls.  This mysterious substance is somehow involved in the birth of mirages - all of them for the first time opened their eyes right here, on the lower level of Trihorh.  Some mirages know that Born is also capable of awakening life in inanimate objects that have been saturated with it.  Does this mean that mirages are also inherently artificial creations?  Who knows.  Born has no effect on the mirages themselves and, it seems, is not even able to stop their aging.  On other organic beings, they did not test it until this thought simply crossed their minds. <br><br>  The skull of the monster is a huge hall with high arches located around the central towers.  It offers a breathtaking view of the infinity of emptiness around, which is slightly disturbed by the faint radiance of the nearby worlds of Spire.  Here mirages experience special feelings, it seems the universal emptiness itself is talking to them, endowing with new knowledge and ideas.  Perhaps this is not the voice of emptiness, but the pulse of Trihorh, or the breath of near worlds.  Mirages are unknown. <br><br>  Finally, hollow horns, the place where the spiral staircases of the towers lead.  Each of the horns leads to one of the nearby dimensions: the snowy world of time paradoxes (Chronoshift), the toad-filled world of portals (Panopticum Airlines) and the fantasy world, divided in two (Unsynergy).  Passing through the horns, mirages travel through these new areas for themselves in search of various sources of portal energy.  For an unknown reason, various manipulations with her give them particular pleasure. <br><br>  We can say that mirages are subtle connoisseurs of portal energy.  They are able to make out the smallest differences in its spectrum, power, nature.  Someone likes to simply admire, someone drinks it, evaluating the taste, someone prefers to experiment with the parameters of the portal-gererator, and someone revels in the process of moving.  If the old stationary portal suddenly changed its color, or completely closed - most likely it could not do without the participation of a mirage.  They were also given the opportunity to restore seemingly long-exhausted portal flows and eliminate various anomalies.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In a word, if you need a true specialist in portals - you know who to contact. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Mirages are also interested in all kinds of things, devices and artifacts, which they can revive with boron, adding to their collection of reasonable objects. Some of them hunt for rarities, receiving secret information and making secret deals. To keep their game a secret to mirages, a special property of the race helps - everyone who communicated with them completely forget about this fact the next day. However, some have not forgotten and have plans to get such a master of secrets to their service. Or already got it.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is worth noting that the ability of mirages acts on them even more when they are inside Trihorn. Each mirage feels alone here, because the presence of the others, both direct and the facts pointing to it, is simply squeezed out of its consciousness. However, shortly before dying of old age, the influence of the ability is dulled and before such a mirage is able to disappear, it can see others.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The architects of Spire are unaware of the existence of this area, although they are involved in its appearance. The thing is that in fact Trihorh is an empty shell left over from the chrysalis of the 13th Architect. Here he was reborn, divided into two halves - Setsozmeen and Thicke. The release of rebirth energy was so great that it tore the Spire tissue and affected nearby worlds, dividing Unsynergy, bringing a breath of paradoxes to Chronoshift and arousing portal instability in Panopticum Airlines. Only young Tick possesses knowledge of the existence of Trihorn and even has a certain influence on him, but keeps all this secret. After all, she likes to play with the souls of dead mirages, from which she makes her crazy and strange artifacts.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Meanwhile, mirages penetrate into other worlds, sometimes leaving quite far from their hometown. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There, in the distance, their abilities begin to fancifully change and distort, succumbing to the attraction of the unattainable Terra. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In addition, mirages gradually begin to learn about the existence of Architects, and most importantly - about the powerful Instruments that belong to them. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What will happen if you revive the Tool with the help of a Bourne, a thing that can erase and create whole worlds? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Has emptiness whispered this idea to mirages?</font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/k9/4a/__/k94a__kzyeq3rgqfvaioa9yc6as.jpeg"><br><br><h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Terraform disfunction </font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">An irrational copy of the real world bordering the region of the Abyss. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This world has a great external resemblance to reality, but nevertheless differs from it, both in the details and in more significant details. Various Agents of Terra found temporary refuge here - both late expeditions that left the Abyss and early ones wandering around the worlds of Spire. Once here, the Agents are observing a huge mysterious creature, which, apparently, is in charge of the local world order and is known as the Fate-Mechanism. Gathering pieces of information, conducting experiments and special operations, they try to understand what is happening here and what they should do next. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The basis of this entourage is </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Forest City</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">: Many roads, freeways, houses, high-rise buildings, and other structures are interspersed with small and large sections occupied by various trees and shrubs. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Two important features are worth noting. The first is that all fragments of the city and the forest have clear boundaries and, although lined up in a single uniform pattern, they do not merge with each other. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Vegetation does not wrap around the house, does not grow through cracks in the road. In the middle of green glades there are no poles and fences. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The second - if you look at the buildings themselves, you can see that they are often unexpectedly connected together. It was as if someone had put different buildings on top of each other and they became one. The same applies to trees in forest areas - sometimes they grow into each other and form various strange conglomerates.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">On the roads of the City-Forest rare cars that drive themselves without a driver are driving. As it turned out, these gizmos are dangerous for the Agents, because after touching, the person and the machine begin to stick together, dissolving into a homogeneous mass. Many Agents paid for their curiosity by sitting inside and leaving behind a charred mangled alloy of flesh and metal. Usually, those who die in this world turn into ashes that ascend into heaven. Some escaped with injuries, having received burns and parts of metal ingrained in the skin. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As observations show, the cars follow a certain plan - they carry all kinds of materials from the outskirts to the central part of the city. It is there, somewhere in the center, with a rustle and a clang that the </font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Fate-Mechanism</font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> roams</font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- a cycloptic octopus-like creature resembling a crawling pile of metal. Parts of the creature shine, rotate, crank, bite into the asphalt, cling to buildings. Agents who were nearby felt a growing rumble and crackles, and also experienced a sharp deterioration in well-being. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In addition, the center of the Forest City is filled with other unpleasant creatures: </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Proto-Weavers</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> and </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Non-Agents</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . The former guard the approaches to special production zones where the construction of something unimaginable takes place. Including, according to spies, there are special technological rooms where people are somehow teleported from Terra, transforming them into Non-Agents, by embedding them in a </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">golden network</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> .</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Proto-Weavers are glass and chrome jellyfish hovering above the ground, with golden Proto-Threads hanging from them, barely visible separately. Using these Threads, Proto-Weavers control Non-Agents and machines. Seeing the detached living creatures, Proto-Weaver tries to grab them with a New Thread, which draws them to the Weaver and causes a growing sense of euphoria. Caught in this way, the Weaver transfers to the procedure for joining the golden network.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Non-Agents are people with golden eyes and liquid gold flowing through veins instead of blood. When they are connected by the Thread to the Proto-Weaver, you can notice the line of golden light emanating from their nape. All of them were conducted through the procedure of unity with the golden network - their blood was completely released, after which it was replaced by a new composition. Also, each of them is given an incomprehensible thing, similar to a black backpack. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Non-Agents represent a strange community inhabiting the central streets of the Forest City. It looks like some kind of obscure pseudo-life, with no obvious purpose. It seems that with their help the invisible director plays different scenes, models situations, experiments with their reactions, building something incomprehensible.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As it turned out, the Non-Agent can be disconnected from the Proto-Thread and it can act independently. Thus, some of them were saved and some details of what was happening that were revealed to their minds during the connection were found out. However, it is still not clear how the Thread was neutralized - each time it happened almost by accident. This knowledge would be very useful, since the Proto-Weavers, in turn, are connected by Threads to the Destiny-Mechanism. Probably, she is the mysterious director-manipulator, trying to understand the creatures under his control. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Liberated Non-Agents experience an inexplicable affection for their backpacks. Or rather, not to them, just for some reason they constantly need to wear something behind their backs. And in black backpacks, something called a </font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">heavy void</font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> was discovered</font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">resembling massive invisible cobblestones. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is not clear what it is. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As already mentioned, the Forest City is full at first glance of familiar, but incredible in essence things. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So, for example, some houses come across books. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But if you open it, then there will not be found the usual sheets with lines of text. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Inside each open book there is a mini-portal gaping from where various substances can be scooped up. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It can be sand, water, clay, gravel, earth, acid, fluff and so on.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In some homes, replenished vending machines with food can be found. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Observing the behavior of Non-Agents, it was found out how to use them - they give out food, in exchange for ... stories! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A little chatter to fill the indicator on the machine with green light, and he will push out the food. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">True, capricious individuals come across who give meaningful, interesting and long stories.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Local trees also behave unusually - tree branches are very solid, do not bend and do not swing. The leaves, in turn, move in response to living creatures that are nearby. They behave as if watching you. If you touch them, they quickly turn yellow, come off and fly up. Areas filled with fresh flowers spread a zero-gravity zone around them. And in the clearing often come across various animals, for some reason, forever frozen in one place. </font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Ergo Nyashek</font></b></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> should be wary of forest areas</font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">. These are gray eyeless babies crawling out of their bushes and cheerfully tweeting in an incomprehensible language. Outwardly, they are harmless, but being at a distance of a meter or closer, they significantly accelerate the aging of living beings. Needless to say, that falling asleep in the clearing is not the best idea that has destroyed many Agents. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">To the south of the central fragments of the city, the asphalt areas are reduced, giving way to sidewalks covered with tiles. Moving further south, you can go to a huge stadium, on the field of which large and small pieces of the pool are scattered. In the center of the stadium there is a helipad, where the letter ‚ÄúU‚Äù is depicted, instead of ‚ÄúH‚Äù.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you plunge into one of the sections of the reservoir, it turns out that under water they are all interconnected, revealing an incredible depth of space. Going below, you can find flooded buildings. And after a while, the researcher will begin to realize that a whole multi-tiered city with ancient intricate architecture is hidden here. And only those navigators and Agents who happened to see the beauty of Utada from the Entourage Fairytale can recognize in this place an almost complete copy of the city of the great stream.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At all levels of the underwater Utada and in the caves, flocks of spotlights swim - smooth black creatures, with a large round hole on their backs, from where a column of light beats. Little is known about them, but they are not aggressive and, apparently, do not pose a danger. In addition, stone statues depicting its fabulous residents can be found in the underwater city. And in some places, analogues of magic crystals are hidden - polished stones that emit a faint greenish light. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the east of the Forest City is another noteworthy thing - the </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Mazut door</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">. This is a giant portal in the middle of a wasteland. A circle of black shiny liquid substance hanging in the air and slowly rotating. After passing through the portal you can visit other worlds of Spire, though you will have to thoroughly smear in this murmuring blackness. Often out of the circle come various navigators, and occasionally Agents of Terra.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Above the City, high in the sky, at the level of clouds, giant flying pale spheres are noticeable - these are the worlds of the Abyss. The way there lies, oddly enough, through helipads (despite the fact that no helicopters were found in this world) scattered across the metropolis. When the balls come close to such areas, lightning flashes above it. During flashes in the center of the site, a certain object appears: it can be a chair, table, sofa, armchair, nightstand, cabin, and so on. In general, this is something that you can sit on or where you can enter, thereby moving to one of the Fragments of the Abyss or hitting the paths of the Abyss. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The Abyss is of interest to the Agents, since the key to return can also be hidden in it. So, for example, some time ago a powerful artifact was delivered from there - </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">X-Toy</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">. An uncomplicated teddy bear whose lantern eyes emit realism into the space in front of it. This radiation destroys the fantastic nature. With the help of the X-Toy, one fragment of the Abyss was erased and several Spire Generations in the adjacent worlds were destroyed. This seems to be an effective weapon against the Architects. Unfortunately, the artifact was lost during the operation to eliminate the Fate-Mechanism. The rays did not work and the group was caught by the Proto-Weavers. Perhaps the group will be able to save and X-Toy will also be found.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The fact that the rays of realism turned out to be powerless against Destiny-Mechanism, as well as some other collected information indicate that the Destiny-Mechanism was not created by Spire himself, but is something significant that Spire took from Terra. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It seems that this whole world is Spiel's unsuccessful attempt to copy Terra, at the first contact. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If Fate-Mechanism is an undigested part of Terra, then this may mean that it initially acts contrary to the will of Spiel. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Be that as it may, the Fate-Mechanism seems to be planning the construction of something grandiose. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But you need to understand in time whether the portal to Terra will be built in this way, or something else to replace Terra. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So far, the Agents do not have enough information to know what consequences this will ultimately lead to.</font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kq/ak/km/kqakkmiazwybeyqfugcx4l8cvdw.jpeg"><br><br><h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Shadowzoom </font></font></h3><br>  A world affected by metaphysical viruses. <br><br>  <i>Note: This entourage belongs to a group of worlds united by an entity with the name Axiom.</i> <br><br>  The soft light of a giant golden ring illuminates this strange world.  This Axiom is a stable translucent formation from an unknown heavy-duty material.  The ring is located horizontally in space and periodically changes the radiation intensity.  Above the Axioms levitate the rectangular rotating frames of the Technosad, and below the tentacles of the Sculpture move.  The rhythm of movement of structures, as well as periods of growth and withering of tentacles are clearly associated with cycles of increasing and decreasing the luminosity of the ring. <br><br>  This whole world is captured by strange unimaginable entities - metaphysical viruses, which in reality manifest themselves in different ways.  They penetrate the minds, hearts and souls of the local inhabitants, <b>tailed people</b> , in all possible ways - some enter their lives as poisons, food and mutagens, others as hallucinogens and narcotic substances, others as addictions, ideologies and cults. <br><br>  The upper part of the world, <b>Technosad</b> , is a cluster of metal structures.  These are kilometers of industrial premises, interconnected by passages, corridors and elevators.  Here, among metal, stone and glass, ordinary people live.  True, they have one feature - they all have a tail from birth. <br><br>  The Technosad includes 7 sectors - each of them looks like a huge rectangular frame that rotates in space.  The frames do not adjoin each other, but in their rotation are connected together, like one mechanism.  Sometimes, following certain periods, an iron bridge extends from one of the sectors over which transport, similar to a mini-train, moves from one sector to another.  Then the bridge is pulled back.  In this way, people travel around Technosad. <br><br>  The so-called "power stones" are installed in many premises of the Technosad.  These are oval-shaped metal containers, some of which seem to have been cut off and pure white light is pouring from there.  The fact is that local people do not need food, and they receive energy when they plunge their tail into this white glow. <br><br>  In some rooms you can find helmets of virtual reality.  Dressing them, the inhabitants plunge into the space of the virtual game <b>"Speed"</b> , where they will ride the futuristic race cars racing along the track on the inside of the Axiom. <br><br>  Many are obsessed with this game to varying degrees, and those who are carried away enough change outwardly under the influence of helmet radiation - their ears lengthen, their hair turns golden, and their eyes become sparkling green.  Nevertheless, not everyone becomes ‚Äúwitty‚Äù (the local name for those who have become an adherent of the metaphysical virus ‚ÄúSpeed‚Äù), some people are not so keen on the game, or they completely abandon it.  Those who nevertheless have become "witty" now receive immunity to all other metaphysical viruses of this world. <br><br>  Other loners were seduced by another metaphysical virus, which they used to call a <b>‚Äúbreach‚Äù</b> - a small loophole in a racing game that brought them into the code space and allowed them to create their own entertainments.  Someone ‚Äúgaps‚Äù absorbs and in the real world cords from the helmet grow, entangling the body.  He himself, captured by the ‚Äúbreach‚Äù, creates a new game space, with his own rules and receives adherents - some of the helmets of Technosad now open access to this new game.  It is not able to absorb some of the ‚Äúgap‚Äù, but it is adapting to coexist with them together after leaving the virtual world.  These people receive a unique gift known as ‚Äúimposed reality‚Äù. <br><br>  Masters of imposed reality make others believe in the existence of some kind of new object in the real observable world around (it is worth noting that such materialized objects remain stable only in this dimension, and outside it collapse or fade, becoming gray empty shells).  An imposed reality can be either general, perceived by all, or partial - for an individual person, for a group of persons, for a master himself, and so on. <br><br>  In the Technosad you can come across music halls that are periodically filled with sound.  Those who remain in the session are immersed in a trance state and are dissolved in many other listeners.  Diverging, this crowd remains in a linked state for a long time, when their minds are one and sensations flow between them.  On the "witty" this music is not affected. <br><br>  The next interesting place is the Wall of Images in the largest sector.  This is a very long room where all kinds of painted animals, or ‚Äúprints,‚Äù as the locals call them, roam along one of the walls.  If a person approaches a sufficient distance, then the ‚Äúprint‚Äù jumps onto his skin, and now travels with him like a moving tattoo.  Wherever the ‚Äúprint‚Äù is, he lives his life - he sleeps, is awake, can switch to another medium, interacts with other ‚Äúprints‚Äù. <br><br>  The lower part of the world - <b>Sculpture</b> , consists of a huge cluster of tentacles, stretching and growing up, towards the Axiom.  Here people live similar to the inhabitants of Technosad, but life in the Sculpture leaves a special imprint on them.  It happens that someone falls from above, from the Technosad.  If such a lucky man survives, then he joins the local community, which is kind to the newcomers.  True, if there is a ‚Äúprint‚Äù on it (which, when falling, forever gets numb in one position), then they will try to eat such an alien entirely or cut off a part from the tattoo, because the one who tasted the ‚Äúprint‚Äù immediately rises to the Technosad - returning the eaten ‚Äúprint‚Äù to The Wall of Images (but already in a frozen state). <br><br>  It is worth noting that in the Sculpture there are no "stones of power" and to maintain energy, locals have to eat blue luminous mushrooms that grow on tentacles in many places.  Usually, the corpses of the dead, decomposing, are absorbed into the tentacle mass and a new large mycelium quickly grows in this place. <br><br>  Mushrooms are quite tasty, but overeating is fraught with danger.  Those who consume mushrooms in excessively large quantities are called <b>‚Äúsmoldering‚Äù</b> - their movements become inhibited, and the body gradually turns to stone.  Over time, the stone flesh cracks and a blue glow appears beneath it.  Although more and more outgrowths form on the stone skin, it more and more clings and curiously bends, until one day it peels off entirely, with one large stone shell.  Underneath is a creature that resembles a moving cluster of luminous mushrooms.  It can no longer deliver articulate speech, but plays strange twitching sounds - a kind of music.  The mushrooms on his body light up with a different light to the beat of this melody.  A fully transformed "smoldering" prefers to be near his shell and seems to be very attached to it.  Some people like their music, but it‚Äôs dangerous to look at the ‚Äúsmolders‚Äù themselves for a long time, since this spectacle has a strong hypnotizing effect and there have been cases when observers died from complete exhaustion. <br><br>  Sometimes it happens that on the tips of the tentacles of the Sculpture silvery flowers bloom.  Their flowering does not last long, but at that time their pollen scatters everywhere.  While this happens, local people try to breathe through the filters and take other precautions so as not to get infected with <b>Silence</b> .  Those who ignore safety measures receive a concentrated dose of pollen and for some time immerse themselves in a magical dream.  When they wake up, they discover that their language now lives a separate life, twitches and from time to time gives them very painful sensations, which intensify with time. <br><br>  Unable to cope with this pain, some of the infected cut off their tongue, after which it crawls out and later grows small tentacles.  These creatures, outwardly resembling something like cuttlefish, are called <b>‚Äúverbs‚Äù</b> and they can be tamed, playing the role of pets in this bizarre community.  "Verbs" know how to communicate, but use only a small set of simplified concepts, unless they are specially trained.  In addition, these creatures are poisonous and can sting the aggressor, threatening their lives.  Left without a language, the ‚Äúsilent‚Äù lose some of their mental defense and henceforth become very vulnerable to the mental commands of other people, which often puts them in the category of weak-willed servants. <br><br>  Those rare ‚Äúsilent" ones that retain their language go through a chain of further transformations - first their back is covered with black oily feathers, then their claws and teeth are lengthened.  After that, the infected person begins to devour the tentacles growing around, and when it is full, the whole body is covered with black feathers.  By that time, the infected person no longer moves, and his body begins to gradually break, twist, grow and transform into something huge, more like a bio-construction than a creature. <br><br>  When the transformation ends, a large octopus ship sways in the place of the infected person, adhering to the tentacles of the Sculpture.  He is impatient to go flying and he makes a symphony of sounds, attracting ‚Äúsmoldering‚Äù ones, which he can use as a source of energy for traveling.  When the ‚ÄúSmoldering‚Äù hears the sounds of the ship, he feels a stronger attachment to them than to his shell and rushes towards it.  When they meet, the ship goes to the <b>Sea of ‚Äã‚Äãportals</b> , which is poured at some distance from the Axiom, Technosad and Sculpture.  From there you can get to other worlds.  People who are tired of living in the Sculpture often also go on such a ship with the smoldering ones, conducting a special ritual for such a departure.  The flight itself is partially controlled by the smoldering one - it communicates with the ship in its musical language. <br><br>  Periodically, in this world, a big real race happens.  The uniform glow of the Axiom is changing and the stripes on its internal path are lit.  The movement of the Technosad frames stops and a special elevator with futuristic speed cars and  sharp-witted rivals ‚Äôadvances to the racing ring.  It is a great honor for them to perform in a real race and their sports cars are roaring along the highway with a roar.  Each of them wants to achieve the highest possible speed, which brings them unprecedented euphoria.  Accelerating to unimaginable speeds, ‚Äúwitty‚Äù racers feel the approach of a special border, the intersection of which will allow them to understand and fully feel the most secret essence of time.  The only problem is that the knowledge of this feeling and the liberation from the shackles of time is irreversible - in reality, such a driver flashes a bright flash and simply disappears.  Time ceases to exist for him and he falls out of it, moving to a completely different level.  This stops many, but in every big race there are several participants who dare to cross the border.  They are remembered by name and revered as great heroes. <br><br>  In the plane of the Axiom ring, at some distance, strange overflows in the air are noticeable.  Upon closer inspection, one can find here a myriad of unstable small fragments of space through which other worlds peep.  Each shard vibrates a little, oscillates and rotates in place.  This is the Sea of ‚Äã‚Äãportals where ships depart from the Sculpture.  Most of these portals are just windows into parallel universes through which you cannot move, but you can observe objects, hear sounds and smell.  Those that are larger pass an octopus-like ship to other portions of the Sea of ‚Äã‚Äãportals or transfer directly to another world, facing adventures. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/84/ev/wx/84evwxlvdbhmy3gifahdwsiefbu.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  Errorzone </h3><br>  A world woven from balloons. <br><br>  Wherever you go, being here, under your feet you will find slightly springy balloons of various sizes.  They are quite durable, despite the apparent fragility.  All the surrounding space is filled with them - they go in all directions, as far as the eye can see, rise up hills and slopes that go beyond the horizon, and sometimes grow into bizarre formations that leave into the sky.  The balls of the "bottom" are most often colored in various shades of yellow (which suggests some of the planes who came here to think about comparing local open spaces with the desert), but sometimes there are "islands" of other colors.  As for all kinds of "outgrowths", "towers", "mountains" and other "structures" towering above the main surface - the colors of the balls included in their composition are very diverse, in addition to the color, the balls can have other properties.  One of the types of such balls with a different property is blue water balls, the shell of which is much more fragile and they burst quite easily, releasing the moisture contained inside them, which slowly rotates in the air into tiny splashes.  Bright red balls are explosive, they contain a magic charge.  Some balls are able to control others, arranging them in the required order and changing their shape. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/u7/aw/mg/u7awmgh_ctdhartbrvlvnkwznqs.png"><br><br>  Bright ball spaces are filled with a strange life - jumping, crawling, flying, burrowing into balls, rolling and levitating food, or eating, as the locals call them.  Snow is intelligent and behaves like wild animals, preferring to walk within its habitats.  Some types of eating prefer to occupy small areas, such as jumping pears that have chosen lowlands.  Others prefer to travel along long routes, for example, traveling bananas, either jumping out of a ball surface, then diving into it, or flying pizza, gently shaking during a flight.  There are other features: a creeping cake loves to devour other food during wakefulness, but when he sleeps, the eaten crawl out of it and scatter.  Ice cream jumps from areas where there is too much light, and carrots, on the contrary, levitate in the direction where it is more light. <br><br>  The race that inhabits these open spaces calls itself <b>Ejens</b> , its representatives are similar to clothes that levitate through the air itself, without being worn on anyone.  These creatures do not need food, but they tend to get new sensations.  The heart of every eugene is a ball of colorful ribbon soaring inside it, most often hidden from prying eyes.  With the help of this tape, an ejen can wrap any meal and, thus, establish a special connection with it.  Tamed food can leave its habitat, and sometimes get various properties or abilities, depending on the identity of the owner.  So, some ejens are able to change the color of saddled eating, its way of movement, endow it with the ability to glow or shoot magic charges. <br><br>  Traveling around this world, you will notice large strange pipes protruding from the balls to a noticeable height.  The material of which they consist resembles iron, and numerous holes are cut through their entire surface, from where the wind blows.  The movement of air is created by the fans that are inside these holes.  From time to time, a large metal creature crawls through the pipe, rattling its limbs.  It is selected from the pipe and illuminates the space for many kilometers around with its unbearably bright belly-bulb.  This is a <b>luminiferous</b> , each of which lives in its own pipe and at various intervals of time either climbs to the surface or crawls back into the pipe.  In this world there is no sun and it is the light-beams that illuminate it.  When most of them are on the tops of the pipes, it becomes very light around, when most of the luminaries creep away, it darkens sharply around, but the light breaks from somewhere below, through the balls, creating an unusual soft illumination of the ball surface. <br><br>  The cloudless existence of the Ejens and the Sedi is poisoned by a group of exile pilots who flew into this world some time ago.  It was a race of wooden people - a <b>kref</b> .  Fleeing from persecution from their own tribesmen, the kref fled from their native dimension, using the transition stone.  Once here and looking around, they realized that they were in heavenly conditions - huge food runs around them that you just need to catch, tons of balls with a wide variety of properties, as well as beautiful flying clothes, putting on which you get magical powers.  So the hunt for augen and food began, which continues to this day.  Over time, a whole palace of balls was erected on the site of the first settlement of the former exiles, and besides krefs, other peacekeepers appeared here, having established full-scale trade with other dimensions, hunting for prey, extracting resources, exploring the area and settling in the vicinity of the palace.  However, not all of them share the Kref attitude to the local fauna, some show interest in the life of the Ejens or even want to help them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/f4/qw/d7/f4qwd7phvhil899o-nkqpaxvnuq.jpeg"><br>  <i>Tomb of the Many World Beast</i> <br><br>  In the middle of one of the bright ball-fields there is a mysterious Tomb of dark green glass, where the Manyworldly Beast is sealed.  All Ejens by nature possess this knowledge, as well as the fact that they themselves and the entire surrounding world dream of a demiurge sealed in the Tomb.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Eugenians prefer to avoid these places, because here they have a growing sense of their own non-existence, and there is a danger of disbelieving in oneself and simply disappearing. For world-walkers, proximity to the Tomb is not so destructive, but they feel echoes of this effect and can, if desired, leave their own bodies. If they live near this place a sufficient amount of time, then they themselves may ultimately disappear without a trace.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It should be noted that from time to time peacekeepers visiting this dimension are so popular with this world that it cannot just let them go further. A small piece of the world goes to the portal, after the departing world-walker, becoming an eugene, the appearance of which copies the outfit of the departing traveler. This ejen has a great affection for the planeswalker who gave birth to him, but most often a reasonable outfit is lost in the portal stream and can be thrown into other places or worlds. However, this will not stop him from trying to find his "mastermind" in his future travels.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">No one knows what will happen if the Many World Beast wakes up, but even the race of Ejens does not know that their sleeping demiurge is one of the Spire Architects Tools. In ancient times, he fell into the hands of an agent of the next dimension, assimilated by Spire. The ability of this agent was the ability to revive objects, so the Instrument gained consciousness and began to create. To begin with, at the request of his benefactor, he wanted to recreate the world destroyed by the Spire. However, it was stopped by the Architects, who neutralized the agent and imprisoned the first in the history of the Spire revived Instrument in the Tomb, plunging into eternal sleep. But even while in a dream, he continues to create. His life, once launched, continues. The sleeping mind of the Instrument gives rise to an endless diverse host of ideas, thoughts and images, packing them in colors and shades.Each ball of this dimension hides in itself a small world that has not yet woken up.</font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cz/hs/w8/czhsw8nuanksnlliqmd2-izi7fy.jpeg"><br><br><h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Animal's anima </font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Animal civilization, developing in the absence of humanity. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The deserted technologically advanced cities of this almost familiar world are filled with intelligent animals that are in different communities pursuing different interests. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The civilization of people for some reason disappeared, but all kinds of animals have risen, gained intelligence and various new abilities. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Apparently, it was people who elevated animals, but for what purpose - it is not clear. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">One of the important roles in animal communities is played by hedgehogs processing solar and cosmic radiation into a </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">halo</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Golden electricity, the discharges of which charge other living things. Over and over again, being fed by a halo, animals increase their own intelligence to a certain level, and in addition, cease to need their usual food, switching to receiving energy from hedgehogs. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Birds are also capable of producing a halo when their flocks form peculiar whirlpools in the air, but this energy is absorbed by the bird flock. The main property of today's birds is a telepathic coherence, thanks to which they are essentially one single huge mind, but it suppresses their individual personalities. Although some representatives of birds for one reason or another fell out of coherence - both single and some small groups.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Among other things, any bird generates a special field around itself, affecting creatures within a radius of several hundred meters and giving them the ability to "communicate" with each other using directional cone-shaped telepathy. Creatures lose this opportunity if the birds are too far away. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Speech, as such, is still present in rare species of animals. For example, in dogs. The fact is that, having risen, dogs become werewolves and, in addition to their usual form, can take the form of a proto-human - something resembling a human being. Dogs can depict speech as proto-people and some groups practice using it.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In addition, werewolves are trained to deal with many things left by people. The proto-form is best suited for this, but not everything is lacking in knowledge and the dogs have just begun to get used to the motor skills and possibilities of a new form for themselves. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The animal community is heterogeneous, straying into interest groups and adjoining all sorts of trends. So, for example, the </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">preachers of the Wave</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> carry out a mission to counteract wildness, transferring animals to recharge with a halo, thereby turning them off from the old food chain. </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The Okhotnikov community</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , on the contrary, is a complex organization led by a secret group that uses a flock of werewolf dogs and other animals to their advantage, while supporting their old way of life, which is close to wild.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Toads in these realities possess powerful black magic, and it was they who organized the </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Triumvirate</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , at the top of which are especially power-hungry amphibians. This organization, by force and promises, gathered other animals under its command, enslaving those who do not resist and offering protection and benefits to others. The Triumvirate quite often gets into the affairs of other factions and communities, for this reason, even toads not related to the Triumvirate, many are wary, respectful or hostile. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Cats have the ability to specifically see and perceive the data contained in all kinds of devices left over from humans.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The turtles have a similar ability, but they do not see this information, but they feel the vibration of the content left by people and their brain begins to process a huge number of streams of numbers near such artifacts. Due to this property, turtles can instantly transmit not-so-complex messages-images at any distance to their other computing brethren. By focusing these flows of calculations, independent of their consciousness, turtles are also able to calculate super-emotions, experiencing lasting feelings of incredible complexity at such moments when they find super-emotion in a whirlwind of data. </font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0r/wb/qy/0rwbqysgvoitrzllo3kjoojyy_8.jpeg"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Feline representatives have chosen urban areas around several surviving data centers, near which they can go into a trance and plunge into the virtual world of </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Weermur</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> .</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Weermur is a huge computer simulation of the human world, a kind of full-scale reconstruction of the life of some past earth centuries, stored inside data centers. Inside this virtual heritage, cats can observe the course of that life in the human community, as well as inhabit the bodies of various virtual inhabitants. Many areas of Veermur are damaged or blocked by strange white noise, people and objects themselves, or their graphical representation, can also be damaged.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, cats do not always understand what is observed from them - naturally, and what was programmatically damaged. One way or another, examining the virtual past of people, cats analyze the principles of the human community, and gradually find answers to some questions, hoping in the end to find an answer about where people eventually disappeared and what happened to the world. True, seals often make the wrong conclusions at all, or rather find confirmation with some own ideas about the world order that differ from the human picture of the world.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It also turned out that by cleaning Veermur from white noise and finding a way to new areas, cats open up new abilities in various animals in the real world. A mysterious white noise from time to time spreads unexpectedly, blocking some open areas, not even occupied by it before. Sometimes this can lead to the disconnection of some abilities and the cats have to restore the integrity of the already open virtual space. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Some individual tailed people prefer to simply have fun in Weermur, not adjoining a group of researchers, but their superficial level of knowledge usually does not allow them to penetrate very far or cause any problems.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The vast majority of animal communities understand the importance of cat work and in every way helps cats that are on guard of digital security, but there are secret groups that want to stop cat activity so that they don‚Äôt break something there, or help dogs quickly develop an alternative way to access Veermur (through proto-human form). </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Some creatures did appear in other layers of reality, in this world abandoned by people. It is possible that this also applies to the people themselves. Local animals occasionally hear sounds made by dolphins and monkeys, but did not see them, even if sounds were heard very close by.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Horses and snakes have also disappeared, but their local animals, unfortunately, can see. This happens from time to time during sleep. The bad news is that otherworldly species feed on these sleeping creatures. Being a devoured nightmare horse or boa constrictor, and most often some bizarre mixture of these species, the victim dries up in reality. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is not easy to protect yourself from being eaten alive by nightmares, but fortunately sleeping in the presence of rabbits is always safe - they are able to shield others from such interventions from the outside. Rats are also protected from the effects of nightmares, which themselves can briefly pass into this ‚Äúfrom the outside‚Äù, slowing down the passage of time. No nightmares were found on other planets.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How did it come to other planets too? Fish can go there, plunging into the universal "depth" and linking two areas located on different planets together, forming the so-called </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">transition area</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . In close contact with fish are wolves, whose ability is the radiation of the weather. Wolves change various environmental conditions around them, including terraforming. They are also in the leading posts of this movement of the </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">interplanetary expedition.</font></font></b> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The movement is interested in attracting as many different animals as possible, whose abilities are invaluable in the development of other planets. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Interplanetary travel itself takes some time, although for the travelers themselves the flight seems instant. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When leaving, the group plunges into the fish range and the fish controlling it falls into the ‚Äúdepth‚Äù, transferring themselves and travelers to another planet, the conditions of which outside the spherical region of the range that appeared there are most often hostile. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">While the Expedition is trying to gain a foothold on other planets, an increasingly complex diverse society is being formed in the native world and new abilities of various species continue to awaken.</font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-j/9y/je/-j9yjei-ffhgyos41dsxycy1_r0.jpeg"><br><br><h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Overshine </font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This measurement is the future in relation to the Bravura Reverse surroundings. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The perishing world of tortoise cities has awaited its salvation.</font></font><br><blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When you call on me, </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When I hear you breathe, </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I get wings to fly, </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I feel that I'm alive </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">C√©line Dion - ‚ÄúI'm Alive</font></font></blockquote><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Once, an unbearably bright white light illuminated the earth, flooded with red-hot magma, highlighting all corners of the dying world. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It was an explosion of a red star that for a long time rested in dark skies, generating faint sparks of hope in those who turned their eyes upward.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">By that time, the situation in the spaces drowning in lava was very bad - only four of the seven tortoise cities wandering over the hot earth remained in health: Omar, Yurit, Arun and Tarnus. The giant city of Rimer was distraught by that time and its disease was transmitted to the nearby Navi and Unpen, muddying the mind of its brothers. After the two giants destroyed themselves by mutual sound attacks, Navi, staggering, crawled towards the rest, not yet affected by the infection of madness. The main priest of the city watched with sadness as the colossus, who had lost his mind, who was his home, was spinning in the last deadly dance, threatening to destroy his whole life in this world. To save the situation, the priest had to recover to the cancerous foci of rot parasitizing on the body of Navi to remove the cordon from them,to nourish the rot with divine nectar and begin to spread it to the vital points of the city.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">To accelerate the process of destruction - now it remained only to hope for this tool. The last thing that the high priest Navi saw in his life, plunging together with a fragment of rot into the waters of the pool of sacred liquid that is in the head of the giant is a strange ripple in the sky coming from a star of hope.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The priest‚Äôs plan worked - Navi completely absorbed the rot, penetrating his circulatory system, stopping progress, growing and processing the giant, together with his people, into a dark, viscous mass of rot. Meanwhile, the residents of the four remaining cities did not yet have time to realize that they had escaped from another danger, when they suddenly saw an explosion of their guiding star in dark skies and a wave of horror swept over their souls. Is it possible that all dreams of rebirth will end, and the legendary first giant, once long ago ascended by a star into the dark skies of this world, is destroyed? Meanwhile, the light intensified, filling everything around with an unprecedented, inconceivable brightness ...</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The first thing that the high priest Navi saw at the beginning of his non-life was the unbearably bright sky and the blinding light around. Rising, he saw his people - one by one they rose from the thick black grass, and after them stone blocks that served them as flying limbs. Their eyes shone with blue light. A group of other creatures approached them, led by another high priest, the Omar drover. Looking at them with his new, luminous eyes, Navi noticed some strange thing: Omar himself and his group no longer had these stone levitated limbs, which the entire Zen-chi race (creatures inhabiting the giant living cities of this world) possessed. The new arrivals shared the good news with Navi - Yazma, the legendary first giant, returned, bringing light to this world. Huge, unimaginable streams of light and energy.And here he is - a huge giant winged city of people moving across the sky.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Many years have passed since the Return of the Yazma. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The dying world has been greatly transformed, being saturated with energies pouring from heaven to earth. Lava flows petrified in the first hours of the Return, and soon the ground was covered with grass and other vegetation, endless fields of flowers appeared. The Mora River, liquids with unusual properties that previously flowed through the lava and ascended into heaven, themselves transformed - now they flowed on them the luminous divine nectar, fiesta, which only the high priests knew how to create. Here and there, the surrounding spaces were permeated with multi-colored </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Psycholine</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> - visible streams of energy. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After a short hibernation caused by unusual radiation, the tortoise-cities were transformed into other forms. Now they are called </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">hyper hierarchs.</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">. Omar has grown a tail, and moves around the world crawling. Yurit got the opportunity to jump and soar on his half-wings. Arun grew several pairs of limbs, like a giant spider, and the thousand-footed Tarnus most of the time plowed underground spaces, laying in them wide tunnels. Their population has lost stone limbs, but in return their hands have grown, like that of the returning people of the winged Yazma, which constantly spends time flying around the world. Now, the inhabitants of these giants can be considered humans. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The lost cities of Riemer and Unpen also revived under the influence of life-giving energies, but lost their ability to move and grew like trees. The inhabited rhizomes of Unpen are piled on the shores of the lake, and not far from it are the residential tiers of Rimer, covered with fiery red foliage. These places inhabit</font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">empty ones</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> are the former inhabitants of these giants that revived with their cities, but lost their former form. Whirlpools of energy pulsate inside their translucent shells. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The city of the people of Navi did not rise again, but became a part of their inanimate bodies that retained their former form, did not turn into people or empty. Now this folk is called </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">imperishable</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . Over time, they built a new city for themselves (again called Navi), and began to study the properties of rot and dead bodies that were saved to her. Such remains affected by rot have been preserved in many places around the world and are of particular interest to imperishable, developing their necrotechnology.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Flying pets that delighted the inhabitants of the lava world, at the time of the Return flashed and turned into creatures woven from light. In general, their shape, similar to squirrel, has not changed, like good nature. The flying plates fell off, but now, ah, they can fly without them. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Colonies of nano-creatures ju after Return returned from the bodies of the remaining giants and connected with a giant swarm of the same creatures that arrived with Yazma. Together, they hovered at the point of river </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">discharge</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , forming a huge complex closed vortex in the air, which the locals called the </font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Megaconstruct</font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . Apparently this huge swarm controls the weather, judging by the fact that from time to time this place generates fog and clouds. But who knows what Megakonstrukt actually does.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Recently, the scientific council of the imperishable has been engaged in a large-scale project to search for the wreckage of the living city of Tonfu, destroyed many years ago. Two of the fragments were found, and it seems that the energy of the world is trying to restore them - which means that we need to find the remaining ones. The high priest almost does not leave the temple laboratory, placing a batch of freshly found dead brains in flasks with a solution to connect them to a huge network of </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Necromatrix</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">with tremendous computing potential. Meanwhile, the imperishable ambassadors went on a visit to Omar. This creeping city has now stopped to be filled with the energy of Psycholine, as all hyperarchs do from time to time. The ambassadors' goal is to deliver to Omar a batch of newly developed weapons that shoot psychic energy. Over all these years, many spatio-temporal portals have formed in the world through which more and more uninvited guests are leaking here - the locals would like to defend themselves from them something, not relying only on the wild magic that is empty. One of such big and scary guests recently made a gap in the wall of Navi, and now it is being closed by a group of builders with the help of controlled particles of </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">nano-rot</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> - these are small spoiled groups of ju who for some reason were not attracted to themselves by the mysterious Megaconstruct ... </font></font><br><br><h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Atlas of Worlds </font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So our acquaintance with the dimensions of the Guidebook came to an end. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, the surreal universe does not end there. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Other, earlier, Entourages are collected in the book Atlas of Worlds. </font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/u-/qd/zk/u-qdzk2s-yvpqzakf1vqpqptg_k.jpeg"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You can find the Atlas here: </font></font><a href="https://twistedterra.github.io/attlas_free.pdf"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Atlas of Worlds, pdf</font></font></a> <br><br><div class="spoiler"> <b class="spoiler_title"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A short list of measurements described there:</font></font></b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ru/ir/vd/ruirvdu9jcx05auagzgsu2nkozc.jpeg"><br>  <i>Fairy Tale Maximum (Fairytale) A vast magical world that is permeated with magical energies, the atmosphere of a fairy tale is felt in everything, magic is put at the forefront and can give unlimited possibilities to everyone.</i>  <i>Only fate, sometimes playing a cruel joke even with the great ones, overshadows the complete triumph of magic.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/c1/p7/lc/c1p7lcbw2uz96s602dezilknisa.jpeg"><br>  <i>World of Angels (Edor) Many small islands floating above the clouds, covered with tropical vegetation and interconnected by huge vines.</i>  <i>Angels protect the locals -
