  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to make money on a blog?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Bloggers are becoming more and more avalanche-like.  If you ask them about why they spend time on blogging, the answers will be completely different: ‚Äúself-expression‚Äù, ‚Äúfashionable‚Äù, ‚Äúand how is it possible without a blog?‚Äù, ‚ÄúIt's just fun to try.‚Äù  There are also people who make real money on a blog.  In this article we will review the common ways of making money from blogging, and we will pay special attention to the additional perspectives that open up to each professional blogger. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Immediately it should be said that the owners of a standalone blog have a certain advantage in earnings options before blogs on special blog services.  Also note that if you are not Dima Bilan or Tom Cruise, then you will not make money on a new blog. <br>  Immediately after you start a blog, try to write it as interesting and regular as possible, so that you will be quoted by blogs of class ‚ÄúA‚Äù.  You get many benefits from this: <br><ul><li>  You have a growing number of visitors; </li><li>  The number of RSS readers is growing, the main indicator of the quality of blogs in the blogosphere; </li><li>  Increases Google PR and Yandex CY </li><li>  Increases confidence in your blog. </li></ul><br>  The level of each of the indicators entails a certain model of earnings.  For example, if you have a lot of visitors and a high rate of RSS readers, then you can sell banner impressions both in the blog itself and in the RSS feed (today this is a very effective advertisement).  If your blog has a very clear thematic coloring, which is exactly how a blog should be, then contextual advertising such as Google AdSense or Yandex.Direct will be most effective for you. <br><br>  If, after another recalculation of the popularity of your website by Google or Yandex, which, alas, pass very infrequently, your PR and TIC figures will increase, then another opportunity opens up for you - selling links from the pages of your blog.  For more information about this difficult business, you will learn, "having rustled" the forum <a href="http://www.searchengines.ru/">www.searchengines.ru</a> .  However, first you need to know that in the same place you can sell places for links in your blog, run through the offers, or use the automatic system <a href="http://www.sape.ru/">www.sape.ru.</a>  You can sell links manually.  For example, the famous blogger Dmitry Davydov put the sales data on the conveyor in his blog davydov.blogspot.com, and has a good charge from this.  Naturally, the price of one link is very tied to the relevance of your subject matter on the Internet, to the value of PR and TCI, as well as to the placement on the site.  You also need to understand that such actions are regarded by search engines as a violation, and your website can lose earned "points" or, worst of all, get into the search bank (all your pages are excluded from the search results).  Meanwhile, the search engines bring a very good stream of visitors for a popular blog, and these are your visitors and future RSS subscribers. <br><br>  Raising the level of trust in a blog is not measured by numbers, although the concept of credibility exists on blogs.yandex.ru - this is the psychological addiction of the blogosphere to the fact that you are not lying and are an expert in what you write.  A person who is believed in real life and in virtual life can sell many services to his readers, and simply be the first.
