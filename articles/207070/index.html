Plus two covers included</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> The hero of this review is the first smartphone of the push-button phone brand Just5 - Just5 Spacer.  One of the features of this smartphone is that it works on the basis of the new MediaTek processor - MT6582M, as well as the pleasant price - 4 950 rubles ($ 150).  At all, <br>  Just5 phones are respectful to me.  Because at one time they helped to solve two serious "mobile" problems at once. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6b5/3ec/bdc/6b53ecbdc4db056a63675695bdcbf6da.jpg"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  The first one was presented by the grandfather: the Nokia 1100 phone, which he loved very much, collapsed after 7 years of operation, and his grandfather did not categorically buy the replacement Nokia 1280.  (I agree with him: Finnish ultrabudget people are deteriorating from generation to generation, and it‚Äôs not at all possible to use the same Nokia 105.) So, I bought him a white Just CP10 - just the color of the dress uniform of the USSR merchant fleet.  The grandfather is satisfied and for the second year he is silent on phone topics. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e1a/576/5c6/e1a5765c61de35e61c5f1e62587743f7.jpg"><br>  <i>Just5 CP10</i> <br><br>  The second problem was thrown by the wife, who suddenly needed a phone for the second SIM-card.  And not simple, but to be cool and generally mi-mi-mi.  Just5 BestInSpace presented it with a multi-colored keyboard.  Also pleased, moreover, her delights and there was no limit.

Then he moved to another "dialer" (for reasons beyond Just5, I quite liked him), but I still left the red brick in the collection. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d7e/ea6/f0b/d7eea6f0b5cf30e177869194be9ac2f0.jpg"><br>  Just5 Brick with a swan umbrella <br><br>  I also remember Just5 CP11 - the world's first phone with a jumping screen.  Neither before nor after anything like this. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c7f/bb0/ad9/c7fbb0ad9776bdc226abbd8438f69853.jpg"><br>  <i>Just5 CP11 with jumping screen</i> <br><br>  And at the turn of November and December 2013, the news came that Just5 is releasing a smartphone.  And it is not easy, since it is: a) ‚Äúthe cheapest with a diagonal of 5 inches and b) the first in Russia on the fresh MediaTek MT6582M platform.  (Yes, he was the first, but now he is not the only one.) Knowing about the love of the Just5 brand for all sorts of unusual things, he took it for a test.  Now here I share my impressions.  But first, I‚Äôll say that they don‚Äôt plan to tie up with push-button phones in Just5 - the brand recently announced a Surf model for 800 rubles.  (And thank God - at least someone will continue to make ‚Äúdialers‚Äù, but now everything is very difficult with them on the market: Nokia has everything in general difficult, Samsung has also forgotten this direction.) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a5/ebd/5ff/3a5ebd5ff3ef5a30afd735caa34496f9.jpg"><br>  <i>Just5 Spacer</i> <br><br>  For a start, it is worth noting that the Just5 telephone dialers were initially targeted at older people, as well as at those young people who love everything bright and, let's say, cool.  Just5 Spacer - this is exactly how the first smartphone of the brand is called - is a kind of a step to the side: this device is designed for everyone at once, since it doesn‚Äôt have any chips for the elderly, as well as acid colors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2b4/fa3/21f/2b4fa321fdc1118f4141344e9cf7a728.jpg"><br><br>  However, it is clear that the developers tried to make the smartphone beautiful and comfortable, with due attention to the little things.  What does it mean?  Well, here is an example: in the market there are car models with a diagonal of 5 inches and above, in which the power button is located on the upper face of the hull.  However, there are very few people with fingers like Freddy Kruger in nature, and it is not convenient to reach for this key.  In Just5 Spacer, it is on the right side - just under the thumb.  At the same time, both it and the volume control swing on the left have a clear stroke and are generally convenient to use. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/781/bb9/22a/781bb922a8b85eb0a88b8b1a186d08f8.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e59/350/31b/e5935031beef6ae727ced1c7b32020b0.jpg"><br><br>  Included are two interchangeable panels - white and black and gray.  The first has a matte surface, and the second in texture resembles a metal.  Both options are very worthy: you don‚Äôt expect to see such plastic in a smartphone for 4,950 rubles.  Moreover, I generally think that developers who use cheap glossy plastic in smartphones need <s>to take their hands off</s> handing their own creations and force them to use them at least a day, so that the smartphone does not lose its appearance due to the appearance of scratches.  And already then, if the developers fail to cope with the task, take your hands off. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dd4/cb9/985/dd4cb998519f07baa25228c6c6b91fde.jpg"><br><br>  The front panel of Just5 Spacer is black, but the device also looks good with a white cover.  I don‚Äôt know how this was achieved, but my black Samsung Galaxy S4 with a yellow back panel looks somehow not very cool.  But Spacer'u on the drum - it is cute and so, and that way.  Both covers, by the way, sit very tightly - the device seems to be monolithic and not prone to play and squeaks. <br><br>  At the same time, the design of the model is quite typical for modern models on Android - a smartphone and a smartphone, I did not find any unique design moves in Just5 Spacer.  Is that the model is slightly elongated in length - under and above the display are sufficiently large "areas". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/44a/e42/78a/44ae4278ad2a47fbf305f3fb56096000.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d82/42f/969/d8242f969fe03be6b8505640a7fd5f45.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/868/e62/0ba/868e620ba7b6b452677eeaa3ccb963d7.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/017/c81/34a/017c8134a9f54c8988ba8a7d6d633678.jpg"><br><br>  The Just5 Spacer screen is unbelievable - an IPS-matrix with a diagonal of 5 inches and a resolution of 540 x 960 pixels is involved in the smartphone.  Pixel density is not very high, as a result, the image is slightly gritted.  Viewing angles are average, especially in the vertical.  In general, it‚Äôs hard to say something special about the screen - it‚Äôs not the worst of its kind, but it‚Äôs clearly not the best either. <br><br>  Chipset MediaTek MT6582M is designed for low-cost devices, which, however, manufacturing companies plan to make quite powerful.  The chipset is really fresh - there is not even a page dedicated to it on the official English site MediaTek.  The following information was found on the Internet: the platform is available in two versions - MT6582 and MT6582M.  The first graphics core works at higher frequencies, due to which it becomes possible to use HD screens in smartphones.  The maximum for MT6582M is qHD, and it is this screen that is installed in Spacer. <br><br>  In general, the MT6582M is similar to the notorious MT6589 - and there, and there, the Quartet of ARM Cortex-A7 cores (28 nanometers) are used.  However, in the latter case we are talking about the maximum frequency of 1.2 GHz versus 1.3 for the MT6582M.  The graphics also vary: the MT6589 uses the PowerVR SGX544MP single-core accelerator, and the MT6582M uses the Mali-400MP2 with two cores.  Just5 Spacer gains about 17 thousand points in the AnTuTu benchmark.  For comparison: smartphones on MT6589 with the same qHD-screen with the same amount of RAM issue something about 13 thousand.  So yes, there is a gain in the "parrots". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/25a/7f2/501/25a7f2501b7d2217aea4193d230f1d79.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0da/7c6/c0c/0da7c6c0ce4d84d5c0d4c83ef90ae882.png"><br><br>  The smartphone is smart, the interface works smoothly.  Just5 Spacer is friendly with games: I drove with pleasure to Asphalt 8, also launched Dead Trigger 2 and Iron Man 3.  It is better to watch the video in HD720p resolution - the device in 1080p pulls the device, but without much enthusiasm. <br><br>  You will have to buy the memory card on a mandatory basis - the built-in 4 GB here, about 3 of them are available, which is clearly not enough for the vast majority of current users. <br><br>  A few words about voice communication and everything connected with it.  The speakers in the model are loud and "clean", the Spacer catches normally - well, like all similar smartphones, nothing new can be said here.  There are two slots for SIM-cards, both are under the back cover.  The radio module is one, so everything is standard. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2b0/f9b/f45/2b0f9bf4583f427adda81968b69f629a.jpg"><br><br>  The software part of Just5 Spacer is represented by an almost ‚Äúbare‚Äù Android 4.2.2 version.  The developers have added a file manager and a few wallpapers from BestInSpace studio - it has long been involved in the development of Just5 phones.  The rest is nothing unusual, see screenshots: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ffc/b7d/374/ffcb7d3741e5b5703a52dd69564354e6.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/00d/852/3fa/00d8523fabd1662bdb844b2635378c10.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/278/0d5/681/2780d56816d439b8f48f15e009309b82.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8a7/f8e/70c/8a7f8e70c3f49acb604554724a5e1f30.png"><br><br>  But the camera interface is modified - exactly the same as in most smartphones on the latest generation MediaTek chipsets.  It looks like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7ab/f8f/a7c/7abf8fa7c114c55a23fde09b75f58473.png"><br><br>  There are two cameras in the smartphone - 2 and 8 megapixels.  The back has autofocus and an LED flash, which can act as a flashlight if you download the corresponding application from Google Play.  The quality of the pictures is not so that ah - in the automatic mode there are errors with setting the white balance, and with the exposure, and the camera does not always focus correctly.  In general, here are examples - evaluate yourself.  From myself, I note that the camera is clearly not the strongest side of this device. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2e7/39d/5b6/2e739d5b62e28e02b80283c6d81084c1.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a5a/de3/52f/a5ade352fcddcdcacd1ff51a83957cc4.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f37/246/3bf/f372463bfdda267c46a5b7d60eb0163f.jpg"><br><br>  Everything is average with autonomy: Just5 Spacer is equipped with a battery with a capacity of 1,800 mAh, which is a very average figure by modern standards.  The MediaTek chipset, at the same time, is quite economical, so the device pulls out the day.  But no more than that - in order to achieve one and a half or two days of work, you will have to talk little, not to go on the social network, not to play and not to photograph. <br><br>  The smartphone comes in such a box - its design is simple, but, in my opinion, pleasant: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e6b/657/098/e6b6570985d2fa90d218fc917e940aee.jpg"><br><br>  Package includes instructions, warranty, a simple headset, charger unit and USB-MicroUSB cable.  Well, once again I will remind you of two sockets - black and white. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3f5/a1b/7bc/3f5a1b7bcf8900f93b5af5afb3859453.jpg"><br><br>  All this stuff (of course, along with a smartphone) is offered for 4,950 rubles ($ 150).  It is really very inexpensive.  Standardly at the sight of such price list you expect to receive something very ancient and very Chinese.  But no, Just5 Spacer is quite a high-quality and modern device.  And, not least, it is very convenient for everyday use.  It is somewhat reminiscent of Motorola Moto G - it also does not have advanced characteristics, but well-thought-out ergonomics and, in general, high usability.  So Just5 Spacer is more like a wine, not a file.  And wines, which will cost the consumer a very nice amount. <br><br>  PS I would not take Just5 Spacer myself (I still like several other devices), but my friends and acquaintances, relatives headed by my wife, actively hint that they want to get this device on NG.  Of the 5 people I showed him, 3 have become well, sooo wanting.  I am very strange to watch it.  Probably the model has charm.  And the point here is clearly not only in price ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/207070/">https://habr.com/ru/post/207070/</a></p>
