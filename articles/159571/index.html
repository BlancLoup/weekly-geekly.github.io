      The main consumer of speed in my life is movies and TV shows, unfortunately in Thailand I watch movies a couple of times a month, I was replaced with cinema content by Thai massage, billiards, swimming, strip bars. <br><br><h4>  <a href="http://pumainthailand.com/category/rabota-2/">Job</a> </h4><br><br>  I got used to the climate in three days, it is very hot and humid, the temperature is 30-35 degrees Celsius, I work at home in a cool setting from Conder or in an open cafe near the house, apparently not everyone can get used to the heat, then work at home or in the Internet cafe (there are very comfortable chairs transofrmery and the fastest optical Internet).  I take the heat much better than the cold and choose the lesser of two evils. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Jobs are not freelance in Thailand </h4><br><br>  It is very difficult, almost all work for Russians is connected with tourism, the most common profession is a guide, they often work seven days a week and receive about 20 thousand a month and they are provided with accommodation and food.  Here, we should rather move in the direction of our small business, make acquaintances with the right Thais and open something for Russian tourists.  Almost all the guides that I know work underground on a six-month tourist visa in a season, and then go home. <br>  Finding another job is very difficult, since you don‚Äôt know Thai, the Thais already know English themselves.  And still tourist work seasonal.  Here, of course, it is appropriate to teach my wife to work on the Internet or help in your work.  Not many can lie on the beach for months <br><br><h4>  How to integrate into society? </h4><br><br>  First you need to integrate into women, if you are of course a man.  Thai girls are easy to contact when you do not need sex with them, can travel with you, show all sorts of things, carry you on your car and much more.  Immediately, I note that there is a certain sponsorship moment here and there‚Äôs no way to go, it‚Äôs in the order of things.  The second thing you need to do is to strengthen ties with the Russian community, I unfortunately do not strengthen ties with them, and I will not say how to do this. <br>  The third is to strengthen ties with foreigners, make acquaintances in massages, on the street, in bars, many live constantly and have a good time with them. <br>  I note that on average, Thais know English much better than Russian, and if you do not know a thousand words in English for a nominal conversation, it will be very difficult for you to integrate into society. <br>  Thais are very curious, in my favorite cafe the owner always asks how different words sound in Russian (she says hi to me and please), asks to tell about Russia, to show pictures and much more. <br>  The most amazing thing is that when Thais eat and it is written on my face that I also want to try it and shoot my eyes, then they are very likely to call me to their company and share food and alcohol with me. <br>  The main idea is to be as open as possible, learn English, change your mentality. <br><br><h4>  Law, mentality, police and other buns for farang. </h4><br><br>  I am Asian and therefore, as for me, everything in life is simpler, my friend who lives near white and has a little more difficult. <br>  The first thing to avoid is a violation of the law, ignorance of situations and any controversial options.  Read blogs and forums about life in Thailand. <br><br>  Prices for me are always lower than for my friend, as in Russia when a foreigner on the market is more expensive for him, Russian to go to the Hermitage is 150 rubles, and a foreigner is 450. Everything is traded easily with good discounts, do not use aggression (after that you can immediately forget about everything), be prepared to say it is expensive and leave, if the seller is willing to make a discount, he will stop you and agree on your price. <br><br>  Remember that the sucker is fate, if you yourself provoke a situation they happen.  It surprises me how people can lose all the money and documents, it is easy to avoid this if you keep the money on the card, and do not carry documents with you. <br><br>  I have never met with the police, as I try to avoid any difficult situations, I understand perfectly well that the police will soon be far from me and I will have to ventilate any issue through a familiar Thai with connections.  In Russia, this is in fact even worse, over the past 6 years I have written a statement or participated in 12 criminal cases, there have been thefts and skull fractures and fights on Nevsky Prospect, in half of the cases we even brought the perpetrators, there is no effect.  And even more so in Thailand, I don‚Äôt hope for the police in terms of lengthy analyzes, but I‚Äôm sure that no one on the street will beat me at the police station, and in a difficult situation, a familiar mom-san will always help send money to the police. <br><br>  About a divorce from a stolen motorbike, they wrote a thousand times everywhere, there is no insurance for a motorbike, you pay for the damage and theft of the motorbike yourself, the same is written in the contract that you sign when renting.  In Russia, it seems to me, if you leave a motorbike unattended it will be stolen with a probability of 90 percent. If you want to protect yourself from such consequences, then rent a car, everything is included in the insurance, except for the cases when you are drunk or intentionally broke the car. <br><br>  At the expense of the law of consumer rights, it all seemed very loyal to me, I had two telephones, the last time a two-part phone did not catch the network on any SIM card, came back, no check, found the seller, told the problem, he checked and issued a new working phone.  Normal brands are issued to global brands, let's say on my fuji hs-20 fotik I have an official guarantor with a shop seal. <br><br>  It is possible to agree with the Thais about many things, the main mistake is aggression, as soon as you showed aggression, raised your tone, began to bend your stick cleanly, your negotiations are over.  Twice I showed aggression, twice I almost with disgrace were thrown out and as a result I had to agree on the most unprofitable conditions in these negotiations.  The mentality of the other do not forget about it, if a person went out of himself he dropped his face and there was nothing to agree with him about. <br><br><h4>  Buying a car </h4><br><br>  In general, you can, it is worth buying only brands that are assembled in Thailand, these are many models of toyota or isuzu, new models will come out much cheaper than in Russia, if you take some Europeans or Americans, they will come out much more expensive.  The point here is that there is no duty on cars assembled in Thailand and there is no left-hand traffic in Thailand.  When buying a car, I would advise hiring an intermediary, for a small amount she will find you a car and advise you on many contentious issues and prices. <br><br><h4>  Children </h4><br><br>  I do not see the development of children except learning English and Russian as a reserve, unfortunately mostly lonely males go to live in Thai and there is very little infrastructure for children in Russian, there are a couple of villages for which the kindergarten is promised.  In general, the issue with children is very complicated and there is no simple enough solution. <br><br><h4>  Why I do not live in Chiang Mai? </h4><br><br>  Because the ocean is far away, but they say it is much cooler than in Pattaya. <br>  About the ecology in Pattaya, I can say that it is better than in any city in Russia where I was, except that Gorno-Altaisk was crystal clear.  In Thailand, most of the transport goes on gas and therefore Pattaya does not choke in the exhaust gases.  You can rent a house in the country where there is a continuous forest and ecology. <br><br><h4>  <a href="http://pumainthailand.com/category/vizy/">Visas</a> </h4><br><br>  There are a lot of options here too, most surely marrying a secret woman, she will lose her citizenship, but both of you will be given a residence permit for 10 years.  Such a service is even sold, it is often paid for after obtaining a residence permit, it costs about 100,000 rubles on advertisements. <br><br>  Study visa. <br>  It's all just buy a training course for a year and wear every three months in an immigrant office paper on training, it costs 25,000 rubles.  You can learn differently, foreign languages ‚Äã‚Äã(English, Thai, German), computer literacy, and more.  You can go to classes, you can not go, I met quite a few people who live on such a visa. <br><br>  Visa free travel every month. <br>  Once a month to leave the country, usually people buy a vizaran and pick them up and drive them to the border, where they go there and there is a new strain for 30 days in Thailand.  Here, to improve the situation, I propose two options, first you can go to the vizaran yourself, say at lunch or at 10 o'clock, so as not to get up before dawn, and you can travel around the country for several days in a different day, very informative and helpful .  My friends also use a different method, they fly and watch all the neighboring countries, you can buy a plane ticket for 1000-2000 rubles in advance from discounter, see Singapore or Hong Kong and make a vizaran for the company.  In general, a simple ride to the border once a month tires. <br><br>  Two-entry tourist visa. <br>  It turns out in another country in the Thai Embassy, ‚Äã‚Äãallows you to live in Thailand for 6 months with one departure in three months.  It is not difficult and is described everywhere a thousand times. <br><br><h4>  Simple conclusion. </h4><br><br>  The prospects of a freelancer do not depend on his place of residence, since all clients are remote and wherever you live your earnings will depend only on you.  Thailand is a good place for young people without children, I know quite a lot of couples who live well in Thailand. <br>  Thailand is a very good place to start, America and Europe are also very good and it is worth trying to live there and there.  I am still thinking about Kaliningrad and South America. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d9f/90b/927/d9f90b927b108649e028a0d4697c9c2b.jpg"><br>  Sunset on the island Cozamet. <br><br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/156985/">Antipode</a> article <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/156985/">habrahabr.ru/post/156985</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/159571/">https://habr.com/ru/post/159571/</a></p>
