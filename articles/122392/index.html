The design of the novelty - a mix of trends from the latest models - one ‚Äúphysical‚Äù Home button and two touch Back and Menu (as on the latest Xperia mini) - and new trends expressed in the form of edging from real aluminum around the perimeter and almost completely solid frontal surface from mineral glass

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/70ad264c/639832cf/727a6d57/58e2b7cc.png"><br><br>  And this is the first Sony Ericsson lately to abandon the elements of biodesign corresponding to the curves of the human body - the ray is more likely for those who prefer the square to the oval.  By the way, ray in Japanese means elegance. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/417fc423/898058ed/b86b5181/d57c1d17.png"><br><br>  The screen is 3.3 ", in which the same 854x480 pixels are hidden as in Xperia neo and Xperia arc (3.7" and 4.2 ", respectively). The weight of ray is exactly 100 grams (here the comparison with the weight of the new Xperia is more appropriate) mini - 94 g about 3 "diagonal screen).  So, in terms of weight and dimensions, it has occupied a niche exactly between Xperia mini and mini pro and Xperia neo and Xperia arc.  For the price is expected to be the same. <br><br>  Inside - already familiar to the readers of this blog "pieces of iron": 1-GHz processor, 1500 mAh battery and a camera identical to the camera of the flagship Sony Ericsson - Xperia arc - the same 8.1 MP + technology improved shooting in low light conditions Exmor R From the new - added front camera, hidden under the glass. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/59d0ac5b/59b0d6af/d3b125d7/0cd84162.png"><br><br>  Also, according to the good tradition of all Xperia this year, the new product will be released on the latest version of Android: 2.3.3 or even 2.3.4 - if the latter does not appear on the ray at the start of sales, it will be released in one of the first updates.  An important question regarding future updates - they promise that they will update the firmware as long as it allows the hardware. <br><br><h4>  Activia </h4><br>  Sony Ericsson Xperia active is a newer niche, but also brighter: a phone for an active lifestyle.  In short, it can be presented as a waterproof smartphone - and this is true.  Engineers promise up to half an hour of painless finding under water at a depth of one meter.  What does it mean?  That you can finally watch cartoons in the bathroom right under the water!  True, without sound.  The slot for the headset is equipped with a special plug, so it‚Äôs unlikely that you can use headphones under water: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/cabca276/92f6542c/e8fc6305/48640b0f.png"><br><br>  Of course, it is compact - a large ‚Äúbrick‚Äù would only interfere with an active lifestyle, drown with it rather than swim out - and the creators of Xperia active hardly meant it, making it waterproof.  The screen is only 3 "(like mini), the dimensions are 55x92x16,5 mm, and the weight is 110 grams with armor. By the way, you can poke the screen with wet fingers - the touchscreen will take all clicks absolutely adequately. <br><br>  An orange edging around the perimeter (the second option is white) catches the eye in case you lose it in muddy water, and, of course, an adult ‚Äúear‚Äù for a strap: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/aa168f62/9c47cdd3/7f7b83e4/d83afb81.png"><br><br>  This is not a toothpick strap cram, here it can be done even with gloves.  In addition to the strap on the wrist, complete with Xperia active also comes with a shoulder pouch for wearing during workouts. <br><br>  By the way, this is not visible in the picture, but the back cover is made of soft-touch plastic - there will be less slip in your hand: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/fd51482b/b513a0e8/00f79ed5/bf6be8f1.png"><br><br><h5>  Soft </h5><br>  Of course, the unusual design of the model could not but support at the level of software - the smartphone contains pre-installed sports applications.  An ideal route for jogging will help you choose a GPS, barometer and compass.  The screen will display the heart rate and pulse in real time.  The iMapMyFitness app will monitor your day-to-day activity, and the newly introduced Facebook inside Xperia feature (deep integration of Facebook services) will allow you to share this information with friends - well, or with a cardiologist, which will probably be more relevant. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/bfd3d4e7/934fc770/39715146/29962b73.png"><br><br>  The smartphone, by the way, has already managed to evaluate Maria Sharapova.  She said she liked it. <br><br><h5>  Interface </h5><br>  Considering the compactness of the screen and the relatively small resolution of 320x480, the icons on the Xperia active desktops are organized using the improved ‚Äúinterface of corners‚Äù already known for the new Xperia mini with the same screen - up to four icons are hidden in each corner, revealing a fan in the half-screen with one click - the principle of action resembles folders in larger smartphones, only it is more convenient - the contents in the folders are not displayed at all, and in Xperia active each button in the corner contains a preview of the hidden icons: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/1704e105/a0176160/60c4a522/4ee793e0.png"><br><br>  Thus, on the desktop, you can register up to 16 buttons. <br><br><h5>  Hard </h5><br>  And instead of the heart - a fiery gigahertz processor, powered by a 1200 mAh battery.  The camera can shoot 5 megapixel photos and HD video. <br><br>  By the way, if someone thinks that all Xperia of this year are equipped with the same hardware, then they were not mistaken - all the main differences between Xperia 2011 are weight, form factor, maximum camera resolution, price and size.  From the user's point of view, this is probably for the best - the phone can be chosen literally by the way it lies in the hand (well, according to the price tag, of course), without bothering about the specifications - ‚Äúsufficient power‚Äù. <br><br>  Global sales of new products will start in the third quarter of this year. <br><br><h4>  Smart stuff </h4><br>  The premiere of two Sony Ericsson smartphones balanced the premiere double of the replenishment of its Smart Extras lineup - unique accessories.  With one of which, by the way, our regular readers are already familiar - talking about the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/sonyericsson/blog/114740/">microdisplay for different occasions Live View</a> . <br><br>  Today, the line of ‚Äúsmart accessories‚Äù has been replenished with a LiveDock multimedia docking station and LiveSound hi-fi headphones. <br><br><h5>  LiveDock </h5><br>  In the photo - LiveDock in perhaps the most popular usage format - as an alarm clock: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/9b649d1c/97642314/b819dff2/04bdca78.png"><br><br>  Another possible scenario is a player in the kitchen (and in the bathroom with Xperia active). <br><br>  The USB connector allows you to connect a mouse, keyboard or gamepad to the docking station (which is why it is called multimedia).  And through the HDMI connector on the phone itself, you can also connect to the TV, the phone at the same time, it turns out, performs the function of the console.  Want - surf the Internet in High Definition, or you can play, for example, in Angry birds.  The docking station itself has no HDMI connector. <br><br>  All new Sony Ericsson phones starting with Xperia mini and mini pro, as well as Xperia pro, active and ray, support LiveDock by default, software updates will be required for Xperia neo and Xperia arc. <br><br><h5>  Livesound </h5><br>  Headphones LiveSound as if created specifically for those who fundamentally reject the quality of the stock "ears."  Promising hi-fi sound, this product of high technology is, nevertheless, on the opposite pole from the ‚Äúwarm lamp‚Äù products: the metal case and flat non-tangled wires underline the modernity of the solutions of this accessory. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/67557431/be7c6907/2aef51c3/7afedee0.png"><br><br>  Other features include the magic LiveKey button, which, together with the volume rocker, replaces the remote control not only for listening to audio, but also for some other functions of the phone, such as receiving / rejecting a call, recording a conversation and listening to music during a conversation.  Among the well-known functions are recording and sharing audio, searching for music by track fragment using TrackID.  LiveKey can also interact with sports applications, for example, capturing the work done for a certain period of time. <br><br>  Developers have the opportunity to write their own applications for LiveKey, and some of the functions of the LiveSound headset will also be available on some Nokia and Samsung models. <br><br>  The black headset will be available with black liners and lime shades of colors, and white with white and orange. <br><br>  Like all other new products, LiveSound will be available in the third quarter of 2011. <br><br><h4>  In the meantime ... </h4><br>  Now, while you are reading these lines, I already twist in my hands all these new items at the Moscow presentation of Sony Ericsson :) Wait for the event report, the first ‚Äúlive‚Äù impressions and photos tomorrow. <br><br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/sonyericsson/blog/">Subscribe to our blog</a> - and you will not miss anything;) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/122392/">https://habr.com/ru/post/122392/</a></p>
