  <section class="page js-page"><h1>"Community Activation" or SMO with a human face</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/176/7a4/852/1767a4852844698a50108c5624650803.gif" width="180" height="142" alt="E-generator logo" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">  The company <a href="http://www.e-generator.ru/">E-generator</a> , which has long and actively used the forces of the "crowd" in commercial projects on the Internet, launched a new service called " <a href="http://www.e-generator.ru/about/author/sf/">Community Activation</a> ".  It is aimed at owners of portals, blogs and forums who want to form a strong, active community of users around their projects who want not only to watch and read, but also to express their opinions.  It will also be useful to those who want to make their new resource visible as soon as possible.  For them, the E-generator will provide specialists in conducting disputes, stirring up "holy wars" and simply sociable and groovy people who can make readers turn into commentators. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  As Vladislav Kochetkov, a spokesman for the FINAM investment holding company controlling the company, told me, the E-generator will work with both small sites (for example, personal blogs) and large ones.  According to him, ‚Äúmost likely, the service will be most demanded by small and medium-sized companies, since  the budgets of large players allow them to solve such issues on their own. " <br><br>  The mechanism of posting comments on customer sites allows you to do this directly from the E-generator site, while the synchronization promises to be almost instantaneous.  Active discussions on the pages needed by the customer are guaranteed from the very first days of working with the service.  Victor Zakharchenko will manage the work of the service, among other content services of the E-generator. <br><br>  Essentially, Mr. Kochetkov confirms this, this step can be regarded as a serious sign of attention that the E-generator is providing to the SMO field, which is still in our infancy, or website optimization for social media.  Today, in the eyes of the public, targeted promotion of a blog or forum using social networks and other services that embody the notion of ‚ÄúWeb 2.0‚Äù is not much different from spam.  And the pioneers of this trend, already quite popular abroad, often become ‚Äúoutlawed‚Äù for visitors of the resources through which they promote their clients' websites.  Perhaps a balanced approach of a reputable company entering the new market will gradually, starting from a small one, be able to correct the attitude of the Internet users to SMO.  Just as the attitude towards SEO has changed when big capital became interested in it.

        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      However, with the similarity of the goals of SEO and SMO, in the case of the latter, the ethical side is particularly worried.  If the optimizer in the old sense of the word in its work acts as a fighter with a sophisticated search engine algorithm created by the same professional as he is, then, if you will, Optimizer 2.0 focuses mainly on living people.  Surrogate communication, surrogate interest is associated with decoy guests at the wedding.  But if you do not take this into account, the business model of the new service has the right to life and, moreover, to success.  In the end, Western models have never taken root in our country without adjusting to domestic realities.  And, perhaps, we are waiting for SMO with a human face, which has no analogues in the world. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/14397/">https://habr.com/ru/post/14397/</a></p>
