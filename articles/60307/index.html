      The simplest is the analogy with sports exercises. <br><br>  Do not immediately try to raise the 100kg bar.  Burst, spoil the nerves and mood. <br><br>  Start with something more tangible, with something that you can lift eight times.  For example, 40 pounds.  Lift them regularly and in a month you will be able to raise 60. After three - 80. If you have been stubborn, then in half a year there will be a long-awaited centner. <br><br>  Many, after reading the motivating and organizational literature, immediately rush into all grave - they get organizers, control calendars, to-do lists, plans for the next five years and in a week, quite naturally, throw it all away with disgust. <br><br>  Start small.  Try something small, something that you can quite easily and simply perform daily. <br><br>  For example, every morning to make the bed (without exceptions) or every second day not to use the elevator, but to go up the stairs.  Or every night something to write in the blog (no matter what).  Or learn two html tags every day.  Or meet every day with a new person - who likes what. <br><br>  Forget about the lists and plans, just mark this one single action in the pinarian. <br><br>  Two weeks in a row some advantages?  Add something else.  Do you handle it without thinking?  Add more complex tasks / habits. <br><br>  Just do not rush, the enthusiasm from the first successes will immediately ask you to hang those 50 kg green pancakes, which are used by the Biggest Guys from the gym, to the bar, but do not be fooled by this.  Add 5 kilograms and work silently. <br><br>  And then will power?  Moreover, this is the same mechanism as your muscle and just as amenable to training.  From small to large. <br><br>  One small weight taken every two weeks and in half a year you can safely eat elephants, easily lead two pinarians, playfully teach chemistry, Spanish, ballroom dancing, go to a macrame circle and squeeze a hundred lying. <br><br>  The method is very old, very simple and very useful.  He must have been for many years, but one of the oldest sources of this method for me was that part of the biography of Benjamin Franklin, in which he described his method of acquiring good habits: <br><br>  <i>I wanted to develop a skill in all these virtues;</i>  <i>for this purpose, I decided not to throw around in pursuit of all at once, but for a certain time to focus only on one virtue;</i>  <i>when I get hold of it, move on to another, and so on, until I finally get all thirteen.</i>  <i>And since some of them facilitate the acquisition of others, I arranged all the virtues in the order in which they are listed above.</i> <br><br>  A detailed description of the <a href="http://www.odinvopros.ru/lib/franklin_01.php%3Fmode%3D1%26id%3D0">"Franklin diary</a> . <a href="http://www.odinvopros.ru/lib/franklin_01.php%3Fmode%3D1%26id%3D0">"</a>  Read, there are many useful things. <br><br>  Gradually, but constantly. <br><br>  Good luck :) <br><br>  Update: noticed in the comments a negative reaction to the calendar-pinarik. <br><br>  Habracheloveki - no matter what control tool you use (I personally use the Excel plate), its very presence is important.  It is very difficult to follow any regular event, without daily fixation of results and comparison of reports.  And to improve something without this is impossible at all. <br><br>  If you don‚Äôt like the word Pinarik, let's replace it with a calendar-franklin, the essence will not change - this is a useful and really working tool of self-control. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/60307/">https://habr.com/ru/post/60307/</a></p>
