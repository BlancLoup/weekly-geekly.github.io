      We specialize in another area ... <br><br>  <b>Trigger mailings in B2B.</b> <b><br></b> <br>  In the manufacturing, wholesale, b2b segment - there are also key points of interaction that can be used as triggers and launch automatic / semi-automatic mailings. <br><br>  But there are these triggers, in contrast to the online store, not only when the client went to the site and left a request ... <br><br>  They occur when communicating with sales professionals and customers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c83/951/fea/c83951fea00b4783a71bc64bbc55173a.png"><br><br>  <b>The most common situations are</b> : <br><ul><li>  The manager sent the client a commercial offer - but the third day there is no answer.  Need to be reminded, maybe the client just ran up and forgot? </li><li>  Billed, but no payment - need to know why?  Perhaps a competitor is cheaper, perhaps the client has forgotten or he has run out of money, and perhaps your manager has been ‚Äúnakosyachil‚Äù and the client is not satisfied with your service. </li><li>  You sent the goods and you need to provide post-sales service.  Ask whether everything is good, whether the product has liked ... </li><li>  Remind me about the periodic maintenance ... Offer extra.  service and encourage re-purchase ... </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f96/6e0/ddf/f966e0ddf9114e92886fbaf0c4c45018.png"><br><br>  This is <a href="https://invola.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg%26utm_medium%3Dblog%26utm_campaign%3Dtrigger">what</a> our <a href="https://invola.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg%26utm_medium%3Dblog%26utm_campaign%3Dtrigger">Invola</a> automatic reminder service <a href="https://invola.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg%26utm_medium%3Dblog%26utm_campaign%3Dtrigger">does</a> . <br><br>  It connects to the mail, automatically registers invoices and quotations sent to customers and, if there was no response within a certain time, uses these events as triggers and sends a reminder to customers (automatically or semi-automatically). <br><br>  Thereby stimulates to make the next step and make a purchase. <br><br>  As a result, the percentage of bill payments grows, managers spend less time on routine operations, and the overall efficiency of the sales department increases. <br><br>  <b>How does it work in practice?</b> <br><br>  In a standard b2b business process, it looks like this: <br><ul><li>  the client, somehow ‚Äúmanifests itself‚Äù, for example, leaves a request on the site ‚ÄúRequest a catalog‚Äù </li><li>  using the standard responder in the automatic mode, on behalf of the technician, the requested catalog is sent with the necessary comments.  This gives the specialist time to complete his current business, while allowing him to keep the client warm. </li><li>  This is followed by a call from a specialist to a client.  The client is already more informed, the conversation is ‚Äúessentially‚Äù. </li></ul><br>  The specialist clarifies the need, and then prepares the technical and commercial proposal. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4a5/d31/8e2/4a5d318e2610498cbf9e63997bebdf47.png"><br><br>  <b>What then?</b> <br><br>  Who works in the field of b2b - know firsthand that <b>only 20% of</b> customers are ready to make a decision right away (to buy or give a reasoned refusal). <br><br>  <b>80% of customers</b> collect a lot of offers from different companies, compare, and only then make a decision.  In many companies and factories there is even a special purchasing department that does just that.  Conventionally, this category of customers can be called "Need to think." <br><br>  If you do not work with this category of customers again (do not write, do not call, do not remind yourself) - most likely, you will lose them. <br><br>  It is clear that if you have a deal in a million, most likely you will not forget to call back. <br><br>  But, if there are many customers, and the average check is not so large, the trigger mailings will become an indispensable assistant.  They do not require time, they do not forget, do not get sick, and they always work with a given quality standard. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7e5/54c/89b/7e554c89b9574f19be7229f9a9a9702b.png"><br><br>  <b>How are trigger mailings implemented?</b> <br><br>  Technically, it is possible to implement trigger mailings in different ways.  We will describe how this is done <a href="https://invola.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg%26utm_medium%3Dblog%26utm_campaign%3Dtrigger">in our service</a> . <br>  Because it is really simple and <b>takes no more than 15 minutes</b> . <br><br><ol><li>  You connect the service to your email with one click <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/invola/blog/21146/">using OAuth</a> . </li><li>  Determine which letters will be registered as ‚Äútriggers‚Äù when dispatched by managers, and when it is necessary to start a mailing (For example, if the manager sent a commercial offer and didn‚Äôt respond to it within 3 days, the reminder ‚Äúwe made you commercial, whether everything suits? "). </li><li>  Choose a pre-written version of reminders and start to use (or write your own version of the letter and start to use). </li></ol><br><br>  The system registers all invoices, commercial offers, and upon the occurrence of a condition (no response within N days) - offers to send a reminder automatically or semi-automatically. <br><br>  Semi-automatic mode means that before sending the manager will receive a notification ‚ÄúYou have 10 accounts to send a reminder to.  Check it out. ‚Äù <br><br>  In this case, the manager chooses who needs to be sent, and to whom he wants to call in person. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/633/b15/b78/633b15b782884918918ffedeb9ef38d7.png"><br><br>  <b>What is the result?</b> <br><br>  Naturally, after you begin to communicate more with customers - customers begin to respond more. <br>  Sometimes they say that everything is good, they just forgot about you - and they will pay the bill.  Sometimes they say that everything is fine, but so far there is no money.  And asked to leave the goods in reserve.  Sometimes, if your proposal is objectively weaker than its competitors, you are openly told about it.  And you can make the right management decision. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/82a/129/566/82a129566f3b46538a77316a22b1f1ff.png"><br><br>  Of course, there are people who do not respond to your personal letters.  How correctly, these are disloyal customers.  The probability of a successful transaction with this segment is extremely low.  There are two options for further work with them: <br><ul><li>  since the system registers all accounts and controls, displays them in a table with the possibility of sorting - you can get the managers to manually ring everyone who received a reminder and did not answer.  This can be practiced in ‚Äústarvation time‚Äù, but, as a rule, there is a result, but it is minimal </li><li>  you can simply not work with them, and give time to more priority customers. </li></ul><br><br>  <b>It's all good, and what is the result in money?</b> <br><br>  Very logical question.  The service has a system of statistics on intensity (how many accounts and KP each manager bills per day), conversions and results. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/61e/115/11d/61e11511dcc543dd931b69451d449c69.png"><br><br>  Since the main task of the system is to increase the percentage of payment of bills, we consider this figure as the main one. <br><br>  Medium-statistically, ceteris paribus, the introduction of the Invola system allows you to raise this figure <b>by 10-15%</b> . <br>  That is, if the development per manager is 1 million turnover and it issues 7-15 bills per day, such a triggering distribution will give, as a mininum, an additional 100 thousand turnover (but, most likely, more). <br><br>  With a profitability of 20%, this will amount to 20 thousand net profit per month. <br><br>  With the cost of the service 900 rub / month <b>ROI</b> will be 20 000/900 * 100% = <b>2222%</b> <br><br>  Not a bad indicator, is it? <br><br>  <b>But never believe us "on the word" !!!</b> <br><br>  Try the service yourself. <br><br>  We give 3 months of free use for a repost (make a repost of this record, follow the <a href="https://invola.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg%26utm_medium%3Dblog%26utm_campaign%3Dtesting_tips">link</a> - it is with a referral link, our robot will check and give you 3 months of free use). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/878/26d/e9f/87826de9fad14f14b8705810c303ff4d.png"><br><br>  Who cares, see the full SlideShare presentation: <br><br> <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/ssuser752a3a/b2b-55418738"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f96/6e0/ddf/f966e0ddf9114e92886fbaf0c4c45018.png"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296642/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296642/</a></p>
