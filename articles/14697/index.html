Ministry of Industry - ready to decree on state support of the beer and fish industry?  Investments prescribed?  The plan for the construction of beer and fish pipelines under the state program "Beer-Fish in every house" where?  Have a secretary?  Okay, I'll check it out and sign it. <a name="habracut"></a>

      The Ministry of Health, I ordered the Ministry of Finance to give the doctors money to develop a global antivirus.  These your shmi-fi zadolbali.  Bots must farm gold.  Uh-uh, well, in a sense, the people should work for the good of the country.  In short, one antivirus is necessary - and powerful, with a constant update.  The update, by the way, can be pumped through the pipelines. <br><br>  Transport Ministry - what a mess you have with the grid going on?  I watched the scheme - it is terrible simply.  The topology is indistinct, the technology is all that one could think of, the protocols are different everywhere ... How do you live with it? <br>  So, write down: drag grids everywhere.  From the glands and cars get rid of, go to the wireless technology - all let the aircraft fly.  Yes, I know that security problems.  But quickly and do not need to squirm and pull the road through every nook and cranny.  Grandmothers?  And what grandmothers ...  Grandmas from the village to the city airport - hang gliders.  So as not to violate the ideology of the network.  And then - like everyone else. <br>  And do not arise come on, and then you will fly first to me!  Picked up lamers in the government, you know! <br><br>  Ministry of Education - what do children teach?!?!?  No, I ask you, are you - completely fucked up there at your place?  So that in a week they collected from all the computers that they ponadavili on schools, mice and burned in Red Square!  On computers - linuh, monitors change to alphanumeric displays of green glow - let the kids learn the correct materiel since childhood!  I'll show you the gruel of my mother - ponadavili winds here, panima, do you think the president is sleeping?  See nothing?  Yes, I for a mile away bilkin spirit smell!  Rabotnichki! <br><br>  Ministry of Defense and the Interior Ministry here? <br>  - I! <br>  - I! <br>  - Natyurlich, damn it!  Were loose here under the previous leadership! <br>  Warrior, here you tell me - what do we have with the firewall?  Something I was told here that the hardware and firmware on the missile defense since the 80s is?  Che paler?  True, what?  Well, damn, you give!  Well, it turns out, it's not for nothing that I am * = ~ MeraCblH ~ = * yesterday in a fit of temper, what else will we see in the real world who, when I'm in the ruler for PePakil?  Taaaaa ak ...  Someone will play out with me with such an approach, I feel ... I have to do everything on my own, all around mediocrity, damn it! <br><br>  So, now you are - a new form with a flasher on a cap and a foot-actuated siren is ready?  And why not in form?  Styyyyydno?  There is nothing to be ashamed of!  People should know their heroes.  And yet - I was thinking here, on the back, nevertheless, correctly, THE CALVES through ‚ÄúA‚Äù should be written.  Nothing that is not in Russian, but everyone understands.  So order to remake there, and since Monday so that everything is in my form!  You will know how to interfere with a simple labor administrator after work to drink a beer! <br><br>  All, all are free!  Ministry of Communications, stay, I need you. <br><br>  (All quietly and quickly go out, looking at each other, hunted.) <br><br>  - Well, Lyonchik, let's get connected, there is one hope for you and me.  We must not let Georgie out of the game today or tomorrow until it cools down.  Well, it really will press the button with hot, his mind will be enough ... No, well, what brought the country to - a firewall from the 85th year without an upgrade!  Ehhh ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/14697/">https://habr.com/ru/post/14697/</a></p>
