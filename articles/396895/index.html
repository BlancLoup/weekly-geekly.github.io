And she met infrequently.  For example, on PS4, the list of such games includes Final Fantasy XIV and War Thunder.  In fact, the usual keyboard and mouse can be useful unless during the fermentation of the web.  But the new set, says Sony, works perfectly in all games. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Solomon's decision for lovers to dominate the console CoD was the <a href="http://xim4.com/">XIM4 product</a> , which is, in fact, an adapter between the console and the periphery.  But its absolutely inhuman price from $ 14,000 (and in some periods up to $ 400) made this decision very doubtful and certainly not massive.  Plus, besides the adapter, the mouse and keyboard itself was also needed, and the configuration and updating of the software also swept away some of the audience.

      Now, one of the two main console manufacturers in the world is licensed by a special set made by Hori, consisting of a mini keyboard and mouse, which plug and play connects to all of the company's current platforms (PS3 and PS4).  He also works on a PC under Windows. <br><br>  Separately, it is worth noting the statement by Sony that the new set will fully support all games on their consoles without any problems.  From the description: <br><br><blockquote>  Designed to work seamlessly with the PS4 system and all games. </blockquote><br>  The device is called Hori Tactical Assault Commander Pro.  Behind a clumsy big name is a set for FPS games.  The keyboard has a corresponding "trimmed" design.  A joystick is inserted under the thumb, which suggests <a href="http://www.razerzone.com/gaming-keyboards-keypads/razer-nostromo">Razer Nostromo</a> .  The mouse is extremely reminiscent of the Razer DeathAdder or other controllers with a "chopped" key design. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/021/848/f24/021848f24283ebd47aa51038a1bcc981.jpg"><br>  <i>Set HORI Tactical Assault Commander Pro</i> <br><br>  If on a PC, such keyboards are not ultimately acceptable due to limited functionality, then this format is almost perfect for consoles, since the total number of teams is small, and there are no text chat windows even in online games on consoles.  Also, the keyboard from the set is fully programmable, based on the photo, also has the ability to save profiles and physically switch between them (apparently, for fine-tuning in different games). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/62b/b5c/c59/62bb5cc597299dee58f2140cd553f9b8.png"><br><br>  Pre-order Hori Tac Pro is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01JTOWU0K/">already available on Amazon</a> for $ 150, which is comparable to the cost of a gaming mouse + second-tier keyboard. <br><br>  What could cause such a move by Sony? <br><br>  First, supporters of gamepads of their favorites no matter how defended, they are absolutely not intended for shooters, which resulted in a number of problems for developers as well.  The most indicative is the situation with separate servers for the same titles on the PC platform and on consoles: keyboard and mouse players are expected to wipe out gamepad players with rare exceptions. <br><br>  Secondly, the sale of this kit not only can bring Sony an additional source of income, but also increase the sales of shooters that the owners of the TAC Pro set are already buying with a clear conscience.  Given the cost of premium titles at 60 USD, the solution is not bad. <br><br>  Perhaps for the second decade, the Japanese, at last, were able to recognize the inconsistency of the gamepad as a device for controlling the FPS.  Of course, as a class gamepads will survive, because they are an excellent solution for simulators, fighting games and the masses of other genres. <br><br>  And for millions of players in multiplayer shooters on game consoles today, something unpleasant happened: soon there will be noticeably more accurate shooting players on the servers. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/396895/">https://habr.com/ru/post/396895/</a></p>
