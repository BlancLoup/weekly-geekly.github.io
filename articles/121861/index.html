      Now we will examine such important issues as: <ul><li>  Assign region to site </li><li>  Forming special snippets </li><li>  Review of the most important words of the site </li><li>  Analysis of site meta-descriptions </li><li>  Indexing problems </li></ul>  These tools are well known to professionals, but not everyone who independently promotes their site knows about them.  This article is for them. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Be sure to register your site in these systems.  With this functionality provided by search engines, you can monitor how your site is indexed, what external links to it appear, for which search queries it is clearly visible in the search results, and for which users make the most clicks. <br><br><h4>  Assign region to site </h4><br>  One of the most useful tools, especially for properly ranking a site in Yandex.  The fact is that the search results for different regions are different - search engines try to show on higher positions those sites that are linked to this region and only after all the rest.  Very often, the assignment of a site to a region occurs automatically and the site owner does not even know about it.  Webmasters tools just allow you to find out and, if necessary, make adjustments. <br><br>  In Yandex, the tool is located in the menu ‚ÄúSite geography‚Äù - ‚ÄúSite region‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/afb/f78/133/afbf78133219560487b570a609df0cce.png"><br><br>  In Google, you need to follow the link "File Configuration" - "Settings" <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b9d/908/d25/b9d908d25bf82272bdac4b99fa8a072e.png"><br><br><h4>  Special snippets for online stores </h4><br>  Snippet - a brief description of the site in the search results.  A snippet consists of a title (which is taken from the TITLE page), a small description (which is formed from the text of the page using special algorithms in Yandex and from the content of the DESCRIPTION meta tag in Google) and the address of the site with additional links.  Here is an example of such a snippet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e36/173/095/e3617309523b9ec391f06f2ec460cde8.png"><br><br>  Using the Yandex.Webmaster tool for some types of sites it is possible to make the snippet more informative.  First of all, it concerns online stores.  In order for users to immediately see in the search results that you are a store and you have the right product or service, Yandex has developed a program for improving snippets: for the pages of the participating sites of the program, Yandex shows special structured descriptions containing information about the store and its products or services.  In this case, the snippet will look like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f07/55e/416/f0755e416d9bfc830e42b9fa36fb33ff.png"><br><br>  In order for your website to appear in search results in a similar way, you must download product information via Yandex.Webmaster - it's completely free.  Participation in the program is permissible when the store fulfills the following conditions: <br><ul><li>  Your website is an online store, a representative office of an offline store, a company providing services, or a site aggregating offers from other companies. </li><li>  Your site is hosted on the English domain. </li><li>  The site contains a catalog of products / services and for each product / service there is a separate page on your site. </li><li>  The site is available contact and legal information about your company. </li><li>  Goods in your store can be purchased by an individual at retail. </li></ul><br><h4>  Transfer of other data about websites </h4><br>  Yandex also offers special placement programs for some other types of sites. <br>  For owners of sites with culinary recipes, abstracts and containing a significant amount of reviews, programs for improving snippets are also implemented: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/10b/ae4/880/10bae48807bb78f7041b2c9141171e58.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e57/600/712/e5760071289724a2c412ee60e923d16f.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ff2/f56/531/ff2f56531192d90cac606c9d93595c99.png"><br><br>  Website owners about deposit and loan services have the opportunity to participate in the Yandex.Services service, real estate websites - Yandex.Real estate, automotive websites - Yandex.Auto.  Sites with a significant amount of dictionary or reference data have the opportunity to become a partner of the Yandex.Dictionaries service and thus increase their attendance. <br>  More information about these features can be found on the Yandex website: <a href="http://help.yandex.ru/webmaster/%3Fid%3D1111995">help.yandex.ru/webmaster/?id=1111995</a> . <br><br><h4>  The most important words </h4><br>  Another fairly useful assistant when working with the site is the ‚ÄúKeywords‚Äù tool in Google Webmasters.  It is located in the menu ‚ÄúYour site on the Internet‚Äù - ‚ÄúKeywords‚Äù. <br><br>  With this service you have the opportunity to see which words are most often found on the pages of your site and analyze whether this set corresponds to the theme of your business.  After all, according to the most popular words of the site, the search engine will determine its subject matter, which directly affects the ranking. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d6c/274/7ef/d6c2747ef8a275b5bece7c5c9d1abdaf.png"><br><br><h4>  Analysis of site meta-descriptions </h4><br>  Another effective tool from Google Webmasters is HTML Suggestions.  Based on a scan of your site, you are given information about possible problems in preparing meta tags. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/028/e5e/153/028e5e1531d483930878bc730543d37a.png"><br><br><h4>  Indexing problems </h4><br>  As already mentioned above in this article, quite an important factor is the correct indexing of your site by search engines.  If your site has any errors, they can degrade the quality and speed of indexing.  Both services - Yandex.Webmaster and Google Webmasters contain tools that allow you to track non-existent addresses (404), which are closed in robots.txt for indexing sections of the site, pages with incorrect coding or unsupported file formats. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/416/92b/b2a/41692bb2a8ae5f6fec479cb5dfc09167.png"><br><br><h4>  Summary </h4><br>  This was the final article from a number of materials (see <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/webdev/119686/">part 1</a> and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/webdev/120505/">part 2</a> ) in which we tried to cover the most important aspects of internal optimization, significantly affecting the quality of indexing and ranking of your site in search results, and also introduced you to some useful tools that can help you when working on optimization. <br><br>  Every day we use this experience in <a href="http://www.web-canape.ru/">our work when creating websites</a> , helping entrepreneurs to promote their business online.  We are satisfied with the result.  If you have something to add, write, share. <br><br>  And I almost forgot.  In conclusion, the main rule that you need to remember all the time: make sites for people, not for search engines, and then the last, as they say, themselves ‚Äúwill reach for you‚Äù. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/121861/">https://habr.com/ru/post/121861/</a></p>
