  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why do people call the Internet</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  For an online business, the cost of a client's call through a basket or a feedback form is much cheaper than contacting by phone. <br>  Specialists are working on the usability of the site and the basket, everything is done so that the client can find all the necessary information on the site, can make an order with a few clicks so that there is not a single barrier on the way to the purchase. <br>  Sites are becoming more convenient, and people continue to call. <br>  The client enters the site, sees the price of a product or service, sees a big green inscription ‚ÄúAvailable‚Äù, calls and asks ‚ÄúIs there any available?  And what's the price ?". <br><br>  The option when people call because the basket consists of 6 steps, and at each one you need to fill out a form with 15 mandatory fields, including passport data and the name of a pet - this is not considered here. <br>  It is assumed that you have a modern site with a good design and everything works flawlessly. <br>  And these <s>radishes</s> customers still do not use the basket, the usability of which cost you a decent amount, but continue to call. <br><br>  Summarizing the almost seven-year experience in e-commerce, I will try to answer why this is happening and <s>what to do</s> with it how to live with it. <a name="habracut"></a>

      <b>1. The buyer wants to hear the voice of the seller.</b> <br>  It is the voice, not the words that he will say. <br>  When buying an expensive item, the buyer fears deception, an error in the description, simply fears - without knowing what. <br>  He should call, hear a voice on the other end, and decide if he trusts that voice.  The seller must ‚Äúsound‚Äù honestly, competently, confidently.  And the sale will take place. <br>  The site must be credible, the information on the site must be accurate, and there will be fewer calls.  A little bit. <br><br>  <b>2. The buyer wants to make sure everything is understood correctly.</b> <br>  He read everything on your site, he went to the forums, he saw the terms of delivery and payment.  But he must hear out loud that this is all true, that this is indeed the case. <br>  If the buyer is sure that the site has up-to-date information, he may not call. <br><br>  <b>3. The buyer wants to talk.</b> <br>  We all love online and automation here, but what about those who prefer to buy products on the market and not in the supermarket? <br>  They say that in the east, if the buyer bargains poorly and the seller does not enjoy this process, he will refuse to sell the goods (even if he has the opportunity to sell it without bargaining, more expensive). <br>  We have had clients for whom the buying process is an opportunity to show off the knowledge of the subject, put the manager to shame, talk with a person who will knowingly agree with the client and place an order for him.  Although the same could have been done through the site‚Äôs basket in 2 minutes - but why lose the pleasure of the process? <br>  In this case, as the site does not improve, such a client will still call.  And if the site does not have a phone written in large letters and it seems to him that they do not wait for his call here - he will go to another site where they are waiting.  And call there. <br>  And orders, and will become a regular and appreciative customer. <br><br>  <b>4. The buyer does not trust.</b> <br>  This is obvious, but it is impossible not to say about it <br>  Buying offline, it is clear where to come to swear in the case of marriage, he sees a specific office and specific people. <br>  Online, this feature is usually not there, or it is stated, but not convincingly enough. <br>  This is a reason for the buyer to be afraid that he will be deceived.  So you need to call and make sure that everything is fair. <br>  The site should say - we are a big solid company!  If the site uses emoticons and jargon in the texts, the probability of a large order falls proportionally to the emoticons and "catchwords." <br><br>  <b>5. Call faster.</b> <br>  Even if your shopping cart allows you to make an order in 2 clicks, some customers are convinced that everything is solved faster by phone.  And they wanted to sneeze on the fact that you have perfected the convenience of the basket for years :) <br>  By the way, such clients tend to make a large order in 2-3 minutes of conversation. <br><br>  <b>6. The person is responsible for his words, but the site is not.</b> <br>  If the site says "delivery within 2 hours," and the person brought the order after 4 hours - you can certainly be offended, but somehow it is not clear who.  On the site? ... On the one who wrote the text on the site?  On the courier or on the director? ... <br>  Another thing, if by phone the employee said - the order will be with you until 18:00.  The client believes this information, and if it is wrong, he blames the person who voiced it. <br>  And by the way, the manager also knows about it, and also feels responsible for what he says to the client. <br>  So if your delivery is lame or on the site, the information written is obviously inaccurate - the manager will first feel it the hard way and come up with a request to ‚Äúdecide something‚Äù. <br><br>  Finally I want to say <br>  Of course, you need to improve the site as much as possible, you need to give a person all the information and convenience on the site, if a person doesn‚Äôt like to call - in no case should he be forced to do it. <br>  But if the buyer feels the need to call - he should have this inalienable right. <br>  And having called - he should get through the first time and hear what will dispel all his doubts and anxieties. <br>  When making a call, the buyer is afraid of hearing rudeness and incompetence and is grateful if he was answered politely and on business. <br>  And, importantly, having successfully communicated by phone - many people tend to continue using the site, since  they know that on the other side of the site - a lively person with a polite voice that you can trust. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/171807/">https://habr.com/ru/post/171807/</a></p>
