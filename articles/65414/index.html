      <em>It is necessary:</em> <em><br></em>  <em>- excellent knowledge of the resources of the Internet environment, fluency in all services and on-line scripts (in terms of website promotion and information gathering),</em> <br>  Interesting wording "Internet environment resources".  (Is that all beyond contact and classmates?) <br>  <em>- a deep understanding of the algorithms of search engines (Yandex, Google) and methods for optimizing sites,</em> <em><br></em>  <em>- experience in editors and knowledge of standards html, Dhtml, php, xml, MySQL, SSI, SMTP, POP3, to be familiar with CMS,</em> <br>  Apparently, the HR specialist‚Äôs composing text is not at all competent in IT matters. <br><br>  The marketer usually does not know this: <br>  HTML is a hypertext markup language. <br>  Dynamic HTML or DHTML is a way to create an interactive website.  Bundle: HTML + JavaScript + CSS. <br>  PHP is a programming language designed to generate HTML pages on a web server and work with databases. <br>  XML is a text format for storing structured data. <br>  MySQL is generally a DBMS. <br>  SSI is a language for dynamically generating HTML documents on the server side. <br>  SMTP is an email transfer protocol. <br>  POP - protocol for receiving e-mail. <br><br>  <em>- installation and administration experience of the IPB Forum,</em> <em><br></em>  <em>- knowledge and understanding of the work of IT solutions and network topology (domain, host, DNS, hub, proxy, router, gateway, local network, etc.),</em> <br>  Ltd. apparently still need to transfer hosting, configure routing and pull the local network.  Poor marketer. <br><br>  <em>- excellent knowledge of MS Office,</em> <em><br></em>  <em>- Photoshop, Flash, 3D Max.</em> <br>  It seems that HR has collected all the "scary" words in one text. <br>  All that was written above refers to the job of a sysadmin / programmer.  Now it turns out that the employee must also be able to work in graphic packages.  To process images, create flash banners, screensavers and videos, and also in Max objects rinderit. <br><br>  <em>Desirable:</em> <em><br></em>  <em>- experience of installation and administration of an online store,</em> <br>  In comparison, what is written in ‚ÄúIt is necessary‚Äù is just like two fingers on asphalt. <br><br>  <em>- knowledge of the basics of economics</em> <br>  I wonder how much?  Do not be surprised if it turns out that you need to reduce the balance.  =) <br><br>  <em>- knowledge of the basics of project management,</em> <br>  This item also raises a bunch of questions. <br><br>  <em>- experience with advertising projects (banner rotation; Yandex.Direct),</em> <br>  Here, the first duty, which somehow relates to Internet marketing. <br>  <em>- experience with corporate database structures,</em> <br>  The HR specialist doesn‚Äôt understand exactly what he wants ... Or he really wants a lot.  Maybe you still need a sharepoint server to maintain? <br><br>  <em>- preferably knowledge of technical English,</em> <br>  I wonder how much?  And what is planned to translate? <br><br>  <em>- photo and video shooting.</em> <br>  Poor ITishnik ... <br><br>  <em>Duties:</em> <br>  But this is quite interesting! <br><br>  <em>Implementation of support for the content, development and promotion of the Company's websites, as well as the development of new GK sites on the instructions of the head of the Internet marketing service;</em> <br>  "Content" - this means that an expert in Internet technologies should also be a copywriter. <br>  ‚ÄúDevelopment of new sites‚Äù - and the developer ... Well, yes =) You know technologies, let's write sites. <br><br>  <em>Monitoring the issuance of sites by search engines according to the list of words of the semantic core, based on the results of the analysis of the results, making amendments to the code and content of the GK sites in the context of SEO.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>Adjustment of the project of procurement of commercial backlinks and sites based on the results of performance monitoring.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>Information gathering, analysis and adjustment of content and conditions for placing contextual advertising.</em> <br><br>  Oh, and SEO too need to be. <br><br>  <em>Development of new banners in the context of the Company's current tasks and their placement on acceptable sites.</em> <br>  Now I understand why I needed a photoshop. <br><br>  <em>Correction of texts of articles and sites for their placement.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>Continuous planned additional work on the ‚Äúwhite‚Äù catalogs (additional registration of the Company's websites)</em> <em><br></em>  <em>Work on the preparation and implementation of projects of auto-issuers, the purpose of which is to increase the inverse link mass to the sites of the Civil Code</em> <br>  And do not you need to rivet doorways with satellite? <br><br>  <em>Scheduled work with an automatic poster in social bookmarking services;</em> <br>  Maybe better pingor write? <br><br>  <em>Search for new sectoral portals and placing full information on them on the GK, the range of goods and services, contact data;</em> <br>  It is strange that it is not written that you need to create industry portals yourself. <br><br>  <em>Writing product advertisements, according to consultations with CC experts in the areas and placing these ads on free boards on the Internet;</em> <br>  A product manager does not need to be? <br><br>  <em>Writing articles of necessary content and placing them on special sites with indication of back links to the sites of the Civil Code;</em> <br>  About copywriting already. <br><br>  <em>Maintain the efficiency and promotion of the forum, facilitate dialogue and bring competent expert information to users;</em> <br>  Yes, you also need to be a product manager. <br><br>  <em>Maintain the efficiency and promotion of the online store, to ensure the completion and relevance of the filing of goods;</em> <br>  Can immediately write to a specialist in Internet technologies unloading from 1C and not bathe? <br><br>  <em>On the instructions of the manager, to ensure the preparation of photo and video materials for advertising campaigns and other SMO and PR events on the Internet;</em> <br>  You also need to be a PR manager =)) And SMO conduct. <br><br>  <em>Monitoring the competitive environment in order to:</em> <em><br></em>  <em>- identify innovations, analyze the impact of these innovations in the context of SEO;</em> <em><br></em>  <em>- analysis of the effectiveness of a set of previously adopted measures for the creation and implementation of a semantic core, as well as making operational changes based on the obtained analytical data;</em> <br>  And from whom to receive data?  Or to collect? <br><br>  - collection of statistical data on the level of optimization of the pages of competitors' sites; <br>  Clear‚Ä¶ <br><br>  <em>Increase the dynamics of attendance of the resource.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>The increase in the number of incoming calls to the call-center marked "Internet".</em> <br>  It's a pity that it is not written that an Internet technology specialist still needs to be a sales representative of the company or an active sales manager ... <br><br>  <em>Periodic marketing comprehensive audit of the pages of the Company's websites and, if necessary, amendments and changes in order to increase the conversion rate.</em> <br>  The HR specialist has exactly read smart articles. <br>  <em>The introduction of web-innovation and dynamic on-line services.</em> <br>  More and services to develop and implement. <br><br>  <em>Preparation and submission of a report on the positions of the Company's websites in issuing search engines on the last working day of the reporting month according to the list of queries from the approved semantic core and their changes in comparison with previous months.</em> <br><br>  Actually, jokes, jokes, but I'm shocked. <br><br>  Apparently, the company has reduced costs and dismissed several of its specialists: admin, programmer, marketer, PR and copywriter.  Leaving some kind of "chief marketing officer".  And now it has been decided to hire one specialist in Internet technologies, who should work for everyone =) in just 35,000 rubles. <br>  I wonder how much the ‚Äúhead of the Internet marketing service‚Äù mentioned by an HR specialist ... earns <br>  Crosspost from my blog <a href="http://adtimes.ru/%3Fp%3D37">http://adtimes.ru</a> <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/65414/">https://habr.com/ru/post/65414/</a></p>
