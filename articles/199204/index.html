He admitted that he had worked for anti-piracy corporations for 12 months and collected information about all users who distributed unlicensed files, pirated hosting and companies that contribute to the distribution of unlicensed files.  Actually, UploaderTalk was founded for this. <br><br>  The UploaderTalk forums were dedicated to making money through file sharing through file hosting.  Participants discussed where it is better to publish files, what tariffs from different companies and similar professional topics. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Paranoia and so recently covers many who use torrents and file sharing.  It is often said that one or another torrent tracker, file hosting or other site may turn out to be a trap, which was specially created by special services for catching livelihood users. <br><br>  In the case of UploaderTalk, the worst fears were justified.  It was not just a trap site.  Its founder under the nickname WDF (real name unknown) spent more than a year to earn credibility on the stage.  He made his way to the number of moderators, and then super moderators on the <a href="http://www.wjunction.com/">WJunction</a> webmaster <a href="http://www.wjunction.com/">forums</a> , <a href="http://www.wjunction.com/">gained a</a> good reputation, and then opened his own UploaderTalk forum about a year ago.

      Interestingly, soon after the departure of WDF from WJunction and the opening of its own forums, there was a leak of information about the founders of WJunction.  Ostensibly, unknown hackers broke into the WJunction server, and UploaderTalk <a href="http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search%3Fq%3Dcache:cFQXtRspmx0J:www.uploadertalk.com/content/adultking-exposes-wjunction-owner-gfy-116/%253Fpostid%253D374%2B%26cd%3D5%26hl%3Den%26ct%3Dclnk">covered</a> this story in detail. <br><br>  Judging by the appeal to users published now, WDF does not feel remorse at all.  In fact, for what reason?  On his side is the law. <br><br>  Why did he do it?  Probably because of the money.  Now the site UploaderTalk and the accumulated base are transferred to the ownership of the American company NukePiracy LLC, which aims to cooperate with the right holders and bring lawsuits against offenders.  The company was <a href="http://www.sos.arkansas.gov/corps/search_corps.php%3FDETAIL%3D410860%26corp_type_id%3D%26corp_name%3DNukePiracy%26agent_search%3D%26agent_city%3D%26agent_state%3D%26filing_number%3D%26cmd%3D">registered</a> in October 2013, and WDF itself will enter its state.  The NukePiracy website was launched in February 2013, since it has announced the <a href="http://www.nukepiracy.com/special-announcement-nukepiracy-acquires-several-related-websites/">purchase of several near-pirate sites</a> , this company is also associated with the <a href="http://www.cashwhore.net/">CashWhore.net</a> project, dedicated to revealing the identities of users who distribute unlicensed content for the money. <br><br>  <a href="http://torrentfreak.com/file-sharing-site-was-a-year-long-pirate-honeypot-131024/">About 1,000</a> users have been registered on the UT forums.  Besides these, WDF probably had access to confidential information (IP addresses, emails) of WJunction users. <br><br>  WDF said that it is now collecting information about ‚Äúpirates‚Äù in other forums, acting under different nicknames.  ‚ÄúYou will never know who I will be and where I will appear,‚Äù he says. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/199204/">https://habr.com/ru/post/199204/</a></p>
