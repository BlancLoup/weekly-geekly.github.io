The car last year was presented as a concept at the Shanghai Motor Show (Shanghai Motor Show).  But only now the company has provided basic information on the car, including its price and power reserve on a single charge. <br><br>  ES8 will start selling next year.  Price starts at $ 68,000 as standard.  Without recharging the car is able to drive about 355 kilometers.  The cost may seem high, but this is only half the cost of the Tesla Model X, the most charged Tesla electric vehicle at the moment. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  At the same time, the company Ilona Mask continues to fight for the Chinese market.  With variable, however, success.  As for the price of an SUV, it is so low thanks to subsidies provided to Chinese governments.  Now, perhaps, the price will be lower by another $ 6,600. As far as you can see, the Chinese are planning to continue to defend their own producers, giving them various benefits.

But then there were rumors that other Chinese companies, producing or planning to produce electric cars, decided to unite with foreign automakers in order to start supplying their own electric cars faster than Tesla. <br><br>  According to the developers of ES8, this is one of the most modern cars of the class of off-road vehicles.  The body and chassis are made of aluminum.  The car looks impressive.  Her seven seats are covered in leather, not a substitute.  In addition, there is a display on the windshield, plus there is a wireless charging. <br><br>  The electric SUV has two engines, the total power of which is 644 horsepower.  From 0 to 100 km / h the car accelerates in 4.4 seconds. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6ce/d6a/a47/6ced6aa479bf4785463d84c213165695.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The Chinese electric car boasts the presence of its own digital assistant motorist.  That is, it is an analogue of the Autopilot system from Tesla.  This system is called NIO Pilot.  This system works on the basis of Mobileye EyeQ4 chip.  This chip was developed by an Israeli company, which separated from Tesla in 2016, immediately making it quite a tough competition.  The autopilot is equipped with five cameras, 12 ultrasonic sensors, five radars. <br><br>  Due to the presence of such an advanced system, the electric vehicle is equipped with the functions of adaptive cruise control, an automatic emergency brake system, a warning about the intersection of a solid line, a warning about the presence of objects in the blind zone.  According to the developers, the computer of an electric vehicle can listen, speak, and also help drivers throughout the journey. <br><br>  The Chinese also created a battery replacement system that allows you to remove exhausted batteries and put new ones in just three minutes.  Battery capacity is about 70 kWh.  The company promises to create more than 1,100 battery replacement stations in China by 2020.  This will help to popularize electric cars and give them more power reserve. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5a2/810/7a7/5a28107a77f9d5ca41b0bf101919814e.jpg"><br><br>  If desired, the car buyer can purchase various additional services, including battery upgrades, roadside assistance and much more.  Every 10 minutes of battery charging gives the car a cruising range of 100 kilometers, which is pretty decent. <br><br>  Now this Chinese company has a lot of fans who are already eager to buy new electric SUVs.  By the way, the company itself is relatively new, it began to work only in 2014.  It is worth noting that in China there are more and more manufacturers of electric vehicles, and, as mentioned above, they are provided with benefits and subsidies from the government. <br><br>  About the SUV Tesla Model X became known in 2015.  Then the company introduced an electric vehicle configurator on its website, which made it clear that the price of this car would be $ 132,000 in full configuration.  The Model X has a set of 90 kWh batteries, which is enough for about 390 kilometers on a single battery charge. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/371115/">https://habr.com/ru/post/371115/</a></p>
