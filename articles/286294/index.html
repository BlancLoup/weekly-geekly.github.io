You will, of course, begin by carefully considering what you need from new employees.  And create a friendly, attractive job posting. <br><br>  You will publish it and wait for your resume to be sent to you from interested applicants.  You report vacancies to your employees, customers, suppliers and fans, encouraging further dissemination of this information.

      When resumes begin to arrive, you will honor each of them with a friendly and humane response.  Glory to technology, it became a simple task 35 years ago!  You will conduct an interview with several candidates and send a thoughtful ‚ÄúNo, thank you‚Äù to the rest. <br><br>  The course of your thoughts will be somewhere like this: ‚ÄúAll this is people.  They spent their time to respond to my proposal, so I can at least ask my colleagues to take a couple of seconds a day to celebrate these efforts.  For our company, there is nothing more valuable than friends and fans.  We do not want to make enemies. <br><br><img align="left" width="300" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a42/084/215/a4208421572944559d32fb44fd4c16fe.jpg">  Some of those who did not get this job could become our employees later.  And all these people can buy or recommend our products.  The recruitment process is important both for us and for those who have applied for vacancies in our company. <br><br>  This is very serious, and to everyone who responded to the ad, I will be treated as a valuable partner - after all, that‚Äôs what each of them is like! ‚Äù <br><br>  You take great care of the candidates who have come to the interview stage.  You will respect their time.  And treat them like they are made of pure gold! <br><br>  Humanity will be the core of your recruitment process, because you are a human being, moreover, intelligent and worthy.  But why usually things go wrong?  Below are ten stupid and self-destructive hiring processes that daily scare away the best job seekers from employers. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img align="right" width="300" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/445/5b9/f63/4455b9f636b249f98d92c1d2bb753188.jpg">  Who suffers from the fact that smart people refuse to work in certain organizations, where the recruitment processes are so bad that normal people prefer not to get involved?  The owners of such companies suffer, as well as their customers, who would benefit if such companies could hire the best people. <br><br>  Suffer and current employees.  I can't wait for the owners and the board of directors to wake up, inhale the aroma of coffee and replace one or two directors who are too lazy or out of date to realize that without the ability to hire good people, business cannot flourish. <br><br>  Here are ten ways in which stupid organizations drive applicants away instead of making the hiring process simple and fun.  Does any of them sound familiar? <br><br><h4>  Darth Vader Jobs </h4><br>  Well, who else will describe the qualities that a Chosen Candidate should possess, like this: ‚ÄúA Chosen Candidate should have more than 20 years of experience in promoting through advertisements on Facebook‚Äù?  After all, you can simply contact the applicants directly, in the spirit of "You can perfectly fit for this job, if you like working with people on the phone." <br><br>  The formal and indifferent style of ads literally screams: ‚ÄúWhoever becomes the Chosen Candidate, it certainly will not be your pathetic ass, goat!‚Äù We begin to insult applicants directly from job advertisements.  What for?  This is the first way employers repel talented applicants. <br><br><h4>  "Black holes" and the failure of answering machines </h4><br><img align="right" width="300" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ee8/2e2/e57/ee82e2e573ad440e9046bb15b3c75204.jpg">  People invest time ‚Äî sometimes hours ‚Äî in their responses to job postings.  After a few weeks, they receive via email a mean answering machine message saying: ‚ÄúYour materials have been received.‚Äù  Is it really so long to make this message friendly and personal - a whole minute? <br><br>  Corporate monsters can not condescend to this.  Too many of them say to the candidates: ‚ÄúIf we want to talk to you, we know where to find you.  If you have not received anything from us, it means that we do not need you at all. ‚Äù <br><br>  Shame on you! <br><br>  Smart employers get rid of their ‚Äúblack holes‚Äù - recruiting portal portraits talented, processing resumes in a more reasonable way.  It is impossible to reduce people to keywords, you know - you grew up here on Earth.  Automated recruitment systems are the worst use of technology to solve human problems of all the world has seen.  Their age ends, no one will shed tears over them! <br><br>  People who never looked (and didn‚Äôt want to look) at the recruiting process with a fresh eye would say: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs impossible to process 5,000 resumes without technology!‚Äù But processing resumes is incredibly simple.  You will need only a couple of simple logic circuits so that not all of the world will immediately respond to your vacancies. <br><br>  What kind of logic circuits?  To find out, read about the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20130925022929-52594-how-i-hire-recruiting-with-a-human-voice">recruitment of human beings</a> ! <br><br><h4>  Take another test, and then another </h4><br><img align="left" width="300" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4b7/31d/e93/4b731de9393f40e188cfd2334576e48e.jpg">  Sometimes the wrong recruitment processes start from this position: "We have so many talented candidates that we should concentrate all our efforts on identifying the best of them."  It is difficult to make a mistake more! <br><br>  It‚Äôs hard to find good people, so why do we put applicants to tests for honesty, literacy, knowledge of mathematics and various questionnaires before even meeting with them?  It's time to stop! <br><br><h4>  Wait, we will contact you </h4><br>  We in the Human Workplace instituted that none of the participants in the recruiting process should wait for a response for more than a week.  If people are waiting for you to schedule an interview, talk to them.  If they have already been interviewed and they are waiting for your answer, talk to them again. <br><br>  Pick up the phone.  Email a respectful email.  These are people!  If the company keeps you waiting for two weeks without any communication with you, they have already informed you what you mean to them: nothing at all.  Run! <br><br><img align="right" width="300" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7db/740/959/7db740959a6840fda6afe04f15569a0c.jpg"><h4>  I will ask questions, thanks </h4><br>  Some stupid organizations believe that the meaning of the interview is to ask a question, while you sit with a meek sheep, answer diligently and wait for the next one silently. <br><br>  Why should an adult man of forty endure such an attitude toward himself?  Those who could be useful to your company, just do not agree, rest assured! <br><br><h4>  Your future salary is none of your business. </h4><br>  Why most employers do not publish the expected level of salary in job ads?  You know why: they want to insure themselves in case they get a candidate with perfect experience who is not aware of the level of wages in the market and is ready to work for food - they don‚Äôt want to miss such a chance!  This is unethical.  Publish the level of salary for each job, if you want to attract talented and sought-after people. <br><br><h4>  Your salary history is our business </h4><br>  What kind of impudence one must have in order to refuse to give the applicant the estimated salary for the vacancy he is interviewing and immediately ask him what salary he has received in all his previous posts? <br><br>  ‚ÄúI will gladly disclose my previous salaries as soon as you show me the table of current salaries and bonuses of your management.  What?  Do you consider this confidential information?  It's good.  So it will be easier for you to understand that my salary history is also confidential. ‚Äù <br><br><h4>  We need one more thing - $ 20,000 free consultation. </h4><br>  Interviews with applicants are great.  But asking or insisting that they write a marketing plan for you is a dirty and immoral practice.  After all, what kind of fool can assume that someone is able to create a marketing plan without having tons of information about the company's activities and goals?  If your managers require job candidates to work for free during the interview process, make them stop it. <br><img align="left" width="250" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ee6/b0f/78f/ee6b0f78fd7841e49db245676a433b40.jpg"><br><h4>  I have no extra time to spend on you. </h4><br>  Before offering a job, the recruitment manager must call the selected candidate or meet with him / her and say: ‚ÄúWe are preparing to offer you a job.  What should we do for you to join us?  Let's discuss everything that matters to you. "  If your managers do not know how to conduct such conversations, show them how to do it.  It will benefit everyone! <br><br><h4>  We offered you a job - what more do you want? </h4><br>  The human resource recruitment protocol that we teach employers provides for a phone call or a face-to-face meeting after a job offer, to make sure that everyone is satisfied.  Those who are about to become your new employee usually have tons of questions.  They need to make sure that the dates of their upcoming vacation fit your company. <br><br><img align="right" width="150" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/818/ac5/391/818ac53914a449a2af14f3dce8fc92de.jpg">  They will find out everything they need to know in order to confidently agree to your offer and go to work in a couple of weeks.  They get acquainted with the future workplace and team, if they have not had time yet, get used to communicating with you and vice versa. <br><br>  An organization will never care more about a person than when it tries to hire him.  But this is only one stage of the process, in which you demonstrate to a person all your position, whereas you need to exercise it at every stage! <br><br>  Fortunately, this is easy.  More and more employers are realizing the link between non-indifference and daily productivity (we at <a href="http://alconost.com/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_campaign%3Dtranslation%26utm_content%3D10_hiring">Alconost</a> , by the way, also adhere to this point of view - note of the translator). <br><br>  We say to both employers and applicants on both sides of the recruiting equation: if they do not get you, they do not deserve you! <br><br><br>  <b>About the translator</b> <br><br>  The article is translated in Alconost. <br><br>  Alconost is engaged in the <a href="https://alconost.com/services/software-localization%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_campaign%3Dtranslation%26utm_content%3D10_hiring">localization of applications, games and websites</a> in 60 languages.
