      This wonderful machine has seen Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows 2000 and Windows XP, finally.  Under Windows XP, of course, the speed was terrible and I delivered up to 64 MB of RAM, after which it was possible to work quite normally.  I don‚Äôt remember what year I broke up with this computer, but a year ago I had to go on a business trip and take a laptop with me.  Then it became necessary to purchase a computer for my wife, she needed to work with texts.  It was a pity to buy money for the purchase of a second laptop or computer, so we then bought the Asus eeePC of the earliest model, which cost about $ 200.  His characteristics were better than my first computer: Celeron 900 MHz, 512 Mb RAM, 4 Gb disk, which is not even a hard drive, but it looks like a flash. <br><br>  So, for 200 bucks in 2008, I turned out to be a more powerful unit than a 1998 computer.  It weighed 900 grams, was preinstalled with Windows XP. <br><br><img src="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/4006/romaklimenko.1a/0_394be_8f87de6f_L.jpg" alt="eeePC"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  I immediately upgraded it, adding RAM up to 1 GB. <br><br>  And here are the impressions of Windows XP on this netbook. <br><br>  Every time I turned it on, a yellow baloon appeared on the screen with a message stating that my screen resolution was too small. <br><br>  Internet Explorer was not suitable either for borscht or the Red Army, because  braked terribly.  Chrome and Opera worked, and used them.  Constantly some hangs of the whole netbook for a few minutes, during which he did not react to anything except the Power button.  After a week, strange messages started to appear at the start about the lack of some kind of drivers, although there was always enough, only I had the admin account. <br><br>  Soon the netbook began to work quite unstably, I was only enough to put on it a Ubuntu Netbook Remix, to be disappointed and abandoned.  Ubuntu Netbook Remix was no good at all nowhere.  I worked even more unstable ‚Äúout of the box‚Äù the only thing that was sharpened by a netbook, so this is its strange graphical shell, which I personally was extremely uncomfortable and unpleasant. <br><br>  Now the second part.  After listening to evangelists from Microsoft about how Windows 7 is good on netbooks, I specifically purchased a 4 GB USB flash drive, deflated Windows 7 from the official site and tried to install it on my netbook.  After half an hour of shaking, Windows 7 told me that it needed 5.6, it seems, gigabytes, which means it won't be for my four. <br><br>  But, once I started, I decided to bring the matter to an acceptable result and put Ubuntu 9.10 on this netbook.  I started quickly, I determined everything, I want to go online, this is <strong>net</strong> beech! <br><br>  And I have the Internet through VPN, otherwise nothing.  And here the brilliance and poverty of open source began: in order to get on the Internet, I had to set up a VPN, and in order to set up a VPN, I had to (attention!) Download a certain network-manager-pptp from the Internet.  Well, okay, I have the Internet on another machine, I googled, downloaded - I can not deliver, because  not satisfied dependencies. <br><br>  It ended with the fact that I went to the dining room with free Wi-FI, launched the Ubuntu Software Center, entered the VPN in the search bar and put the package I needed.  The solution, of course, is not that very difficult, but it‚Äôs easy to imagine how many people, precisely because of the lack of a single package, will choose Windows XP, where there are no problems with configuring VPN. <br><br>  On the other hand, after the appearance of the Internet, I uploaded updates, turned on XGL effects (on a netbook!) And now this ancient netbook doesn‚Äôt slow down (as it slowed down on Windows XP), has Windows enabled Aero-like effects (which wouldn‚Äôt be on Windows 7).  In general, finally got a gadget that you can use and enjoy even the housewife.  Although the keyboard is too small for typing, but having a small Linux server at hand is always nice. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/78771/">https://habr.com/ru/post/78771/</a></p>
