As part of the "roadmap", it is proposed to create high-tech automated production of the "future" - with digital modeling and a flexible production cycle. <br><br>  According to the plan, by the second quarter of 2018, similar production will earn for the aerospace industry and engine building.  The first stage of the program is designed for 2017-2019, and the project should be completed in 2035.  Its results will be a developed network of high-tech industries throughout the country. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Talks about total modernization and construction of the ‚Äúfactories of the future‚Äù have been going on since 2011 ‚Äî it was then that the Agency for Strategic Initiatives was created on the initiative of Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, who is the author of the TechNet Road Map.  In July 2016, at the meeting of the ASI expert council, the current President of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Putin, approved the concept of high-tech industries planned for creation.

      It is planned to use the existing capacities for project implementation.  Thus, the project for engine-building will be implemented on the basis of NPO Saturn.  Now the association is engaged in the production of gas turbine engines for aviation and the military industrial complex.  NPO Saturn is the heir to the plant in Rybinsk, founded in Tsarist Russia by decree of Nicholas II.  The first engine was released in 1916. <br><br>  In the next two years, the project is planned to spend from 14.6 billion rubles - this is the declared total budget of TechNet.  Half will be allocated by the state, the remaining funds will have to be sought in various funds and from private investors.  At the same time, the release of new products to the market in the field of aircraft is 25-30 years.  That is, if tomorrow the production of new engines on the basis of NPO Saturn will start, based on existing technical processes, they will actually enter the market only in the 2040s.  When using computer simulation, which is planned to be implemented as part of the TechNet project, the development and testing process will be accelerated many times over. <br><br>  ‚ÄúUsually they create a prototype of a product in a metal, test it, make changes and collect the prototype again.  Testing a virtual digital model in a computer is much faster.  To do this, data about components, materials and their behavior are entered into the computer, ‚Äùsaid Alexei Borovkov, vice-rector of the St. Petersburg State Polytechnic University, co-director of the TechNet working group. <br><br>  If TechNet cannot find funds from private investors or in funds, then the whole project will be in jeopardy. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/401585/">https://habr.com/ru/post/401585/</a></p>
