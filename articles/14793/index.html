  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Hot topic: Windows vs Linux</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Please read the article to the end. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/da2/e3e/d97/da2e3ed97927c0807505097a024dc143.jpg" width="320" height="230" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left"><br>  Probably the hottest topic of discussion in various blogs and forums, conferences and presentations.  One has only to indirectly compare Windows with Linux, immediately a controversy erupted in a universal scale.  At one of the Habratopic, not directly related to this problem, this topic was again raised. <br>  Anyone touching on the subject of Windows vs Linux runs the risk of being trampled, but still ... <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  In that habratopic, it was suggested that Linux is heavy for an ordinary user, that it is difficult to configure it for yourself and learn how to use it.  Therefore, Linux is still losing Windows. <br>  Let's try to figure it out.  I think no one will argue with the fact that Windows on desktop systems is far ahead of the prevalence of Linux.  Unfortunately, if only a job (an accountant, a broker, a secretary, a writer) binds a person to a computer, he has never even heard of Linux.  Also, no one will argue that Linux and Windows are very different from each other.  Accordingly, it is difficult and expensive to transplant an accustomed person to a green lawn, my documents daddy and a Windows user calculator on Linux.  Those who understand administration will agree with the fact that Active Directory on a network with windows-based client computers is necessary and necessary for automating the administration process.  There are alternatives, say from Novell, but their implementation will be more expensive.

      What are the many companies that make Linux-based distributions to fix this situation?  Microsoft has a great program - Word.  It works with documents and saves them in doc format.  Now also in docx.  So, we will urgently introduce the doc and docx format into OpenOffice.  Will there be a new AERO 3D interface in Vista?  We pereplyun them!  We have a similar to appear faster and it will be cooler!  Do many games need DirectX?  Porting! <br><br>  In short, any Linux distribution can be represented as a clone of Windows.  As is well known, the original is always the best copy, at the very least, the same. <br>  Now let's see how things are going with browsers.  IF we follow the above trend, Microsoft will write the next version of Internet Explorer with new features and everyone will start writing their sites using these very features.  Manufacturers of alternative browsers - try to copy IE.  Thank God, things are completely different here!  There is an online community that releases new standards - RFC, and according to them, browser manufacturers release their new products.  Including Microsoft. <br><br>  And what about us with all kinds of network software?  Here, too - the standard goes, the software is written for it!  But the software does not come out and everyone frantically starts copying it. <br><br>  Until a certain international organization is created, which will dictate what should be in the new OS, what standards it should support, how drivers should be arranged for it - there will be no end to the primacy of Windows.  And this is an example of MAC OS, which spat on the formats and standards of Windows.  And oddly enough - this system has won its small but stable tidbit of the market. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/14793/">https://habr.com/ru/post/14793/</a></p>
