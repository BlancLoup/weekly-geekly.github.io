It becomes immediately clear that the filmmakers are going to quote Gravity.  Alas, it can be done in 2017 only in some absurd trash, because viewers have already looked at it and are unlikely to be delighted again.

      In reality, the power supply of the station turned off due to incorrect actions of the MCC.  On the "Salyut-7" there were two transmitters of the command radio link, with the help of which they controlled the station.  On one protection worked - ‚Äúknocked out traffic jams‚Äù.  It was not surprising, he worked for a long time and almost developed a resource.  But, instead of switching to the second transmitter, the MCC decided to try to turn on the first one again.  As a result, a short circuit damaged both transmitters and discharged the batteries.  The station without control and electricity began to drift in space.  I understand that meteorites look better than ‚Äúwe ourselves were mistaken‚Äù, but, firstly, the truth is more important, and secondly, training young people on old mistakes is the right and useful thing.  We want one of the children who saw this film, then went to work in the MCC? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/98e/56b/5a9/98e56b5a98fc4fa2ba637a9cef0df4a2.jpg"><br><br>  The American Shuttle Challenger really had a cargo bay of a similar size.  But, as in the well-known joke, the presence of a certain aggregate does not mean its indispensable use for criminal purposes.  Someone in the USSR might have been frightened by the potential abduction of the station, but in reality there is no documentary evidence of preparation for such an operation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/824/d43/b76/824d43b766b64c269caee8c1b601753c.jpg"><br><br>  Docking in the form in which it is shown in the trailer is terrible.  Even with the adjustment for the cine shortening of the distances and the increase in speeds for more drama, it is impossible to dock this way.  If directors cannot show the <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/286510/">true drama of the</a> task ‚Äúwe need to quickly develop a docking algorithm,‚Äù and then, working as a team, realize it in space, then this is a problem for directors, not history. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/df2/014/7fb/df20147fb6684e5f960a0409540df772.jpg"><br><br>  Hats, by the way, were in reality.  Here is the original photo from orbit. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/406/4ff/146/4064ff1462384546a81c6e9ccc17a015.jpg"><br><br>  Alas, a smile from a really nice detail is instantly erased by the beginning trash. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/3ed/c22/132/3edc221323d04254bb5e2812da0e58e4.jpg"><br><br>  Typical cinema re-dramatization.  But, besides this, there was also an inaccuracy - it was cold at the station, and when the cosmonauts of the experiment for the sake of (MCC approved) spat on the block that was near, the spittle froze for a second in three seconds. <br><br>  Well, then the flight of fantasy writers in general, nothing limits. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/e63/367/9e9/e633679e9f8346099af8a56fe446b935.jpg"><br><br>  Flood at the station.  In reality, the closest to this was a few years ago, when astronaut Luka Parmitano had real chances to drown in a spacesuit when going into space.  And on the ‚ÄúSalute-7‚Äù, on the contrary, there was a shortage of water, which was sent by the very first cargo ‚ÄúProgress‚Äù.  In the memoirs there is a story about the discovery of water behind the panels and the search for cloth to remove it, but in the shown form the flood is, of course, overkill. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/949/b85/af8/949b85af8307403391b8f9d8bb12ff0a.jpg"><br><br>  Fictional accidents are still small, and the flood is replaced by fire, depressurization and failure of the oxygen regeneration system.  The real fire was on Mir, but even there, at worst, the astronauts would simply leave the station.  Scenario dislocation, because of which ‚Äúonly one can be saved‚Äù is not shown, but I am afraid that there will be nothing sensible there - invented accidents look worse than real ones. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/7ee/3fb/2ab/7ee3fb2ab5eb45abaffded06a0bec434.jpg"><br><br>  In TsUPe, in the meantime, instead of professional work, some neurasthenics fight and break furniture.  It is clear that they wanted to show the tension in the style of "Apollo 13" (yes, they could not resist there once and kicked the railing), but the way it looks in the trailer is disgusting.  The then real Council of Chief Designers, headed by Valentin Petrovich Glushko, was a very intelligent man, and, even while reporting off his subordinates, did not raise his voice.  Why is this intelligence unworthy of being in the frame? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/9f7/d4e/6e6/9f7d4e6e6e40476190fde1186fd6af9d.jpg"><br><br>  Again, we quote "Gravity", spitting on real events.  Is it not clear that the public is already in the teeth imposed? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/3b6/217/790/3b6217790855400aa59f7bd920c9b501.jpg"><br><br>  <i>"Say what is there in this damned cosmos</i> . <i>"</i>  At this we will bring up the younger generation?  Instead of telling me how interesting this work is?  Against the backdrop of this year‚Äôs recruitment of astronauts? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/aa3/54e/2c8/aa354e2c846f40c197ab785fd571e5e3.jpg"><br><br>  Is there a fight in orbit too?  The Institute of Biomedical Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences is not offended to look at how bad their job of screening people who are unsuitable for space is being shown at the movies <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/46b/6c5/308/46b6c5308f5d44daa040492e7607f41c.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/9b6/400/715/9b6400715d484cdfa012ab38ccb54545.jpg"><br><br>  When in the American "Armageddon" the Russian cosmonaut was shown wearing a hat with earflaps, with a sledgehammer and drunk, this caused outrage.  And now our directors show exactly the same thing - hats, sledgehammers and alcohol, and offer to be proud of the history of our space program.  Yes, I myself in the lecture <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DV53S6BTVXWw">"space bikes"</a> talk about alcohol smuggling.  But there is a question of relevance!  It is one thing to tell about it in a light and relaxed atmosphere, with the obligatory comment that it did not affect the performance, and the doses were minimal.  And quite another thing is to add it to the drama as the norm. <br><br>  And all this is crowned by a terrible cover of "Herbs at Home".  I understand that it is difficult to come up with a new song about space, which would have been sung for decades.  But maybe it was worth at least to try?  At the same time, that in <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/287872/">‚ÄúTime of the First‚Äù</a> a cover from ‚ÄúMoscow-Cassiopeia‚Äù is used, there is a feeling that, apart from the old songs, we have nothing left. <br><br>  I was hoping for a good movie, and my hopes are broken.  Very disappointing and really want to end up wrong.  For some reason, we rarely manage to make films about astronautics that you want to watch many times - in Taming the Fire, the strange love line and the unnecessary death of the protagonist, Returning from Orbit is impossible to watch, the Paper Soldier is an art house in the Green elephant ".  Unless "Gagarin: First in Space" and "Alien Ship" can be reviewed.  And this is against the background of the fact that in the West they somehow manage to make dramas (Apollo 13), biographies (Guys, What We Need), family films (October Sky) and just calm ones with excellent humor (‚ÄúPlate ‚Äú) That delight, inspire and make empathize even when viewed for the tenth time. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/373497/">https://habr.com/ru/post/373497/</a></p>
