  <section class="page js-page"><h1>XLGet - a new word in the sale of content</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In recent years, digital content has become the only one preferred by many.  Many have stopped buying physical media - CDs, books, newspapers.  Much, if not all, that interests us, is available on the net.  The whole world is moving in the direction of numbers, in this regard, the question arises how to sell their content.  Large online stores have already solved this problem for themselves in most cases, although of course there is still room for arguing about the convenience and affordability of payments for buyers. <br>  And what should thousands of freelancers or single authors do: how easy is it for them, without spending a lot of effort and resources, to let them trade in the fruits of their labor?  It was for such purposes that the platform for selling digital content was created - <a href="http://xlget.com/">XLGet</a> .  What kind of service it is, how it works, what we apply for - all these details and working examples of using the service under the cut. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  And so let's get started, the idea is simple as a door and therefore available to absolutely all network users.  <a href="http://xlget.com/">XLGet</a> is a platform for selling digital content, if you utterly exaggerate, the user, after registering, uploads his file to us, sets the price of the goods in the admin panel and receives a link to this product, which he can place on his website or in any other place.  Potential buyer clicking on the link sees the price of the goods, pays for it via SMS and downloads the product, that's all. <br>  Now a little more detail.  At the moment, the service provides while the only way to pay for the goods is SMS, this payment method was chosen as the most affordable for ALL network users, coverage is more than 50 countries of the world.  In the process of connection are merchants of payment systems WebMoney and PayPal, as an alternative to SMS payment. <br>  XLGet is a subsidiary of one of the largest SMS payment aggregators of the <a href="http://smscoin.com/">SmsCoin</a> company, which allows the authors to pay a high percentage of content from each SMS message sent. <br><br>  Now let's look at how this works on one specific example.  Warm days came, most of the public began to wear T-shirts and it was time to buy new ones.  Of course, you can not bother, go to the nearest store and buy something from the assortment provided, but for many this way is not acceptable for various reasons, and then the buyer‚Äôs eyes turn to online T-shirt shops - there is a choice for all tastes, but there are also huge disadvantages .  Before buying you can not touch and assess the quality of the goods, in addition, you have to pay for postal services for the shipment of goods.  These shortcomings deter many buyers.  In many, if not all cities, it is possible to print a picture on a T-shirt, here are the advantages on the face, there is no need to pay for the quality of the goods on the spot, and they will be printed from the sketch that you provide to them.  But where to get the original sketch?  This is where our service comes in handy.  Designers who draw sketches, as a rule, work with affiliate programs of stores selling t-shirts, the profit from each sale is small, and you cannot count on large sales of t-shirts with your design.  Therefore, it is much more profitable to sell the sketches themselves: the buyer, having paid a small amount for the image file, will take it to the nearest printing point, and a t-shirt will be printed on it.  Fast, economical and practical!  As an example I will give a <a href="http://creativshik.wordpress.com/%25D0%25BC%25D1%2583%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8-%25D1%2582%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0/">link to the blog of</a> one designer, who has already put up for sale his sketches for printing on T-shirts.
