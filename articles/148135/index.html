  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Man: evolution of technology or technology of evolution?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It is human nature to consider himself the best.  Throughout his documented history, a man each time argued his right to be called the crown of creation.  And in each era, he considered himself more spiritual, smarter, more developed, more progressive and more rational than his predecessors.  The banner of evolution, falling out of the hands of ancestors, was always carefully picked up by contemporaries and proudly breathed at the peak of the anthill of mankind. <br><br>  But the slogan "Bread and circuses" collected stadiums and in the period of antiquity, and now.  The principle of ‚ÄúMoney does not smell‚Äù continues to wield the consciousness of both the rich and the poor, even while you are sitting in front of the monitor and are reading this text. <br><br>  That is right here.  And right now.

      <b>But what has changed since then?</b> <br>  <i>Technology.</i>  Modern capabilities of technical devices have long been eclipsed not by the fact that the wildest assumptions of the Middle Ages, but also the last eightieth years of the twentieth century, which are quite recent.  Three generations ago, the pinnacle of engineering was rustling with punched cards, occupied an entire room, and knew how to solve quadratic equations.  Now it has shrunk to the size of a palm, and replaces both the main tool of labor and the main source of pleasure with itself. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Technology is what determines human evolution.  Religion is orthodox and dogmatic, culture is static in its traditionalism, and philosophy is too reflexive to change anything. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bdd/365/6e9/bdd3656e97acf00e2d43e03ccbe5486f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>When does a person change?</b>  - Never.  When does society change?  - With the development of technology: trace to footprint, nose to nose, face to face.  Man received fire - and called himself king among the beasts.  The man swam across the ocean - and the world changed its shape.  A man came up with drugs - and life has become so valuable that there is no place on the planet where there is no man.  The man came up with the ultimate weapon - and the war lost all meaning.  The man came up with a computer - and ... what? <br>  Why?  So little time has passed to notice something?  To at least something to realize? <br>  Relax, already thought for you.  Do not worry - not so bad. <br>  So straighten your back.  Remove your left hand from the face.  Lean back: we will think of something else now.  After all, if the past is somehow intuitively clear, with the experts-critics cooking too abstrusely, we can only think about what our role is going to be - about the future. <br><br>  <b>What comes tomorrow?</b>  No, it's silly to talk about USB in the back of my head and two tablets offering a choice of two different and tempting computer game scenarios.  Such tomorrow, probably, someday will come.  But we, the fragments in the dynamic and alive, like a fat organism, the flow of information.  Splinters, trying to bend in such an incredible way, so that we stick more than any beautiful, tempting, bright and interesting content. <br><br>  We are the strings of the global network, and our sounds are likes on the Internet.  We are the heart, accelerating the pace at the sight of a response to our own repost or at the sight of a meme carefully placed with a friend on the wall.  We know and are confident what the future will be.  We already live in it and believe: what will be next will be even tastier, more, more interesting, more fun. <br><br>  We are technology.  We are a network.  We are the Internet. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/148135/">https://habr.com/ru/post/148135/</a></p>
