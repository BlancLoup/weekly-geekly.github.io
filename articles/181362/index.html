Compact, stylish, with good sound for its size - the main features of a portable speaker system which I will tell you today. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7aa/3d7/292/7aa3d72923ccdbe5e0042f3101abb21b.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  <font color="#C98437">‚ñ∫</font> Declared specifications </h4><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c5d/bd1/58e/c5dbd158e066bbd82b332c46eb270821.png" alt="image">  4 x 1 "neodymium magnet based emitter + 1 low-frequency wOOx (total output power: 12 W) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/856/e20/040/856e2004061a9d365fd339051edf491a.png" alt="image">  Bluetooth profiles: A2DP, AVRCP, HFP, HSP <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/606/7a4/6c0/6067a46c0cc40384f343753fd52458e1.png" alt="image">  The ability to control gestures <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ed3/995/93d/ed399593d41a2d8cef956b6c20eb31c3.png" alt="image">  3.5 mm line input <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e2c/6d2/247/e2c6d224717409adfa09a1a6effeff5e.png" alt="image">  Voice alert on charge level and connection status <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b0a/2f0/c51/b0a2f0c5151565d7ad22b6548eaca9d7.png" alt="image">  1300 mAh battery (up to 8 hours) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0d6/598/1a8/0d65981a80a55a05019aba9215d64193.png" alt="image">  Dimensions: 63 x 63 x 182 mm <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b2f/bfb/235/b2fbfb235eb524cec4c6508c5931bc2b.png" alt="image">  Weight: 0.61 kg <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">A complete table of specifications from the official website of the manufacturer</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/29e/eda/7d9/29eeda7d94689c5493defa9b22d8dc0f.png" alt="image"></div></div><br>  In the Shoqbox lineup, besides the hero of our today's review, there are 2 more models - the SB7100 and SB7200.  The first, in terms of design, is a complete analogue of the SB7300 (with the exception of color color), and is distinguished by two emitters (instead of four) and, accordingly, output power, which positively affected the weight and size parameters.  The second model is also built on the basis of two emitters and differs from its senior counterparts in a shock and waterproof housing. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#C98437">‚ñ∫</font> Packing and packaging </h4>  Philips SB7300 comes in a fairly large box of thick cardboard black.  All sides are filled with text informing us about certain features inherent in this device. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6dd/d27/26f/6ddd2726fc62a1c67d49822107153b81.jpg" alt="image"><br>  For example, the audio system can be used both vertically and horizontally.  Interesting is the ability to combine two devices to get stereo sound.  Such a system 2.0. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f60/0db/4b6/f600db4b62eab18470d8e08a431cfa13.jpg" alt="image"><br>  In addition to the ‚Äúshock box‚Äù itself, the package includes: a huge number of <a href="http://download.p4c.philips.com/files/s/sb7300_12/sb7300_12_dfu_rus.pdf">instructions</a> in various languages, warranty card, certificates of conformity with GOST and CE (more about them later), 3.5 mm stereo cable for line-in, USB cable and charger. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9b9/0e8/47f/9b90e847fb591fedbb5ad8720864739c.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The power supply is standard: 2 A and voltage of 5 V. It is assembled soundly, it heats up during charging, but not critical. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/042/b01/128/042b01128a7c055051681049eb3fbf63.jpg" alt="image"><br>  By the way, about certificates.  If you believe these pieces of paper, our test subject corresponds to at least 5 guests.  All of them are in the ‚ÄúElectromagnetic Compatibility of Technical Equipment‚Äù, except for the latter - <a href="http://docs.cntd.ru/document/1200080202">IEC 60065-2009</a> , which is responsible for safety requirements. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e06/6ae/ff8/e066aeff8a8f102564d483396e477a9d.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Good quality packaging, quality packaging, in a word - brand. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#C98437">‚ñ∫</font> Design, build quality </h4>  The whole device is made of metal.  From the general concept stands out only the pad on the sensor control gestures.  The speakers are covered with a metal grid, and the ends are covered with aluminum lining. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f92/404/497/f92404497e21481a4f8b2e9f6dd0528a.jpg" alt="image"><br>  On one of the ends are all the main controls: the volume control and the function button (about it later).  The first, besides, is combined also with the power button.  The controller has an unlimited course, but when the volume is set to maximum, the device will beep and after that, with a pleasant female voice, will notify you of the achievement of the final indicator. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0bb/88d/917/0bb88d917e2b0cbcbafbdbb2126324fc.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The opposite is covered with a rubberized cover, which is also used as a stand when using the Philips Shoqbox SB7300 in a vertical position.  Under the cover is a connector for charging the Micro USB format. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/62f/eb3/8e1/62feb38e190f3248debac85f559fbbb6.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The lower part (the junction of the protective mesh) is masked by a small aluminum plate with integrated rubber feet.  Nearby you can see a line-in port for wired playback devices. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c15/51a/ef1/c1551aef19de91d691255b04a0d0ed6f.jpg" alt="image"><br>  In general, the design of the "Shockbox" leaves only positive impressions.  The whole construction is made of metal, which gives the device a premium status, the build quality is also at the highest level.

    <h4>  <font color="#C98437">‚ñ∫</font> Management </h4> The speaker supports any device with Bluetooth 2.1 or higher.  If your device does not have this function, then a connection via a 3.5 mm line input will come to the rescue. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/189/d48/3f3/189d483f3f9ed8a8adf85cf5e0faa57f.jpg" alt="image"><br>  First you need to activate the speaker itself by pressing the power button.  As a result, the LED ring behind the volume control should get a blue glow. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/622/14f/74d/62214f74df116515edd9b8536af605f2.jpg" alt="image"><br>  After that, on a device with Bluetooth, you need to perform a search and connect to the ¬´SHOQBOX¬ª.  Upon completion of the connection, the acoustics in the voice mode indicates the operability: ‚ÄúSHOQBOX is paired‚Äù.  By the way, the ‚Äúvirtual woman‚Äù can speak 4 languages ‚Äã‚Äãand unfortunately there is no Russian among them. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/821/387/1c3/8213871c3488f5ebacc4802680f7fa3e.jpg" alt="image"><br>  As you can see, in both cases, the connection takes a few seconds.  But it's time to talk about the main "feature" of this gadget - gesture control.  To activate the intelligent mode, double-click the button next to the volume control.  After that, with a voice that is already familiar to us, they will tell us about the activation of this mode.  Subsequent management also has no difficulties.  In order to switch the track you need to move forward or backward.  Holding the hand from top to bottom, you can pause or restart playback.  Elementary and, at the same time, convenient.  Moreover, the actions do not necessarily perform hand.  ;) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/329/e82/16d/329e8216de01b19e1d6f988710a220fe.jpg" alt="image"><br>  A button near the volume control performs other actions, for example, after a single press, the acoustics will notify you of the charge level.  With a long hold, the voice notification language change mode is activated.  I already mentioned the possibility of combining two speakers into the active system 2.0 at the beginning of the article and this can be done (actually only in no other way) using an intelligent sensor: swipe from left to right over the left speaker and simultaneously from right to left above the right speaker.  After the voice notification, you can establish a Bluetooth connection.  At the same time, the left speaker becomes the main speaker and with its volume control you can change the overall volume level. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#C98437">‚ñ∫</font> Internals </h4>  A characteristic feature of the articles in our blog is the opening of the monitored devices.  But in this case did not work, the device did not succumb to my screwdriver, so I will show only the beginning of the preparation. <br><br>  In the on state, remove the volume control cover.  Do not forget to turn off the speaker. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1ca/8e4/2a1/1ca8e42a18d492a97512750ba107cbb9.jpg" alt="image"><br>  We remove the paper scattering filter that covers the printed circuit board with LED indication. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dfd/4f7/b56/dfd4f7b565fbc0c090e9307cfef03610.jpg" alt="image"><br>  There is nothing interesting on the board - a LED, a pair of transistors and a strapping.  Unscrewing a pair of screws on the PCB can remove the aluminum cap. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/480/ebc/3d8/480ebc3d8284b1eca3673f56499f540c.jpg" alt="image"><br>  On the reverse side it has two cables that need to be turned off for subsequent disassembly.  But at this stage I stopped, because even if you unscrew the two subsequent screws holding the volume control, you will not be able to remove it.  He firmly "sits" on the glue + seal for tightness inside the box (closed type speaker). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/111/bf4/287/111bf4287c613988a43da15b90a650b6.jpg" alt="image"><br>  If you try to peel off the seal and get the volume control, you can inadvertently break the speaker tightness, which can drastically change its sound. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#C98437">‚ñ∫</font> Sound </h4>  On the technical side, the SHOQBOX is equipped with four inch emitters with neodymium magnets.  Total power - 12 watts.  A characteristic feature of this acoustics is a soft sound with a sufficiently large stock of volume.  That is, unlike cheaper counterparts, the number of distortions in the "shockbox" even at maximum volume will remain within acceptable limits.  In simple words, there will be no yelling, blasting eardrums and causing ear bleeding. <br><br>  The sound is smooth, with no emphasis on any frequencies.  The only thing is that the bass sags a little at maximum volume, but the sound still remains at a good level.  In general, the sound is only positive impressions, but let's not forget that everyone's susceptibility is different and ideally would listen to the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A0%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%258C">IRL</a> system before buying. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#C98437">‚ñ∫</font> Operation and autonomy </h4>  Given the sound characteristics of this device, there are quite a few options for its use.  Whether it is background music at a family dinner, dancing at a small party or quiet in your office.  The exception is active rest, for this in the arsenal of Philips there are similar systems, but already with certain degrees of protection from external influences.  A nice addition is the ability to use speakers as a speakerphone thanks to the built-in microphone. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1f1/162/497/1f11624979b7af0a799610cd4f9c7f19.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The SB7300 is equipped with a 1300 mAh battery.  On average, acoustics showed autonomy at the level of <b>6-8 hours</b> - a very good indicator as for such sizes.  Charging the device from the power adapter or dual USB-cable.  During charging, the indicator flashes red and the static light symbolizes the end of the battery charge. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ffd/149/339/ffd1493392eaddaa9fc8a257356d40af.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Do not forget the developers and the power saving modes.  So, if music playback is not started within three minutes after switching on, the speaker will go into power saving mode (‚Äúcut off‚Äù the power from the amplifier), which is indicated by a blue indicator that flashes at certain intervals.  And after another 15 minutes of inactivity, completely shut down. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#C98437">‚ñ∫</font> Results </h4>  Philips SHOQBOX SB7300 - portable speaker system with excellent appearance, good build and no less high-quality sound.  Given the price in the CIS (9900 rubles), the device is absolutely niche, because not everyone can afford to spend such a sum on a portable speaker.  But it is worth looking at <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref%3Dnb_sb_noss_2%3Furl%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps%26field-keywords%3DPhilips%2520ShoqBox%2520SB7300">Amazon</a> and before us there is already a rainbow price of $ 120, which this audio system more than justifies. <br><br><h5>  Advantages and disadvantages </h5><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a7/99a/ea7/3a799aea7d11fc5d49274e15b6642e35.png" alt="image">  Work with any Bluetooth devices version 2.1 and higher <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a7/99a/ea7/3a799aea7d11fc5d49274e15b6642e35.png" alt="image">  The ability to control gestures <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a7/99a/ea7/3a799aea7d11fc5d49274e15b6642e35.png" alt="image">  Body materials, design <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a7/99a/ea7/3a799aea7d11fc5d49274e15b6642e35.png" alt="image">  Build quality <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a7/99a/ea7/3a799aea7d11fc5d49274e15b6642e35.png" alt="image">  Sound <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a7/99a/ea7/3a799aea7d11fc5d49274e15b6642e35.png" alt="image">  Battery life <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4f2/996/400/4f29964003baaf62d7bfefa7f2e32bf1.png" alt="image">  Price in the CIS <br><br><h4>  <font color="#C98437">‚ñ∫</font> Related Links </h4>  <a href="http://www.philips.ua/c/audio-system/premium-12w-sb7300_12/prd/%3Bjsessionid%3D6FF394184159F21EDFC8C7682052B8EA.app102-drp3">Philips On the manufacturer's official website</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.iphones.ru/iNotes/shoqbox-sb7300-sb7200-review">Review from iPhones.ru</a> <br><br>  I remind you that you can subscribe in order not to miss new reviews and articles <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ce4/0f1/d16/ce40f1d1668436a03738295da0147749.png" alt="image">  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/boxowerview/">on the company‚Äôs page</a> (‚Äúsubscribe‚Äù button), or on your favorite social network: <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/65b/3be/e78/65b3bee7828b50a8709d8b4efd7ed6d2.png" alt="image">  <a href="http://vk.com/boxoverview">Vkontakte</a> , in <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/af0/c75/e89/af0c75e899d6d00331728ea364e1dc43.png" alt="image">  <a href="https://plus.google.com/communities/108620202455758035379">Google +</a> , in <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3f6/1c3/a24/3f61c3a24d4eeabb55869f810a17a4af.png" alt="image">  <a href="https://twitter.com/Box_Overview">Twitter</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/181362/">https://habr.com/ru/post/181362/</a></p>
