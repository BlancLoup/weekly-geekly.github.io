All these three years we talked about him on Habr√©: we wrote about how it all began, we were proud of the results of the first two years, our teachers shared their experience, we published lectures.  During this time, teachers and students have done a great job: our program has become more extensive, more useful and better, there were open preparatory courses, we organized a summer school.  We already have 6 semesters of intensive study, by the end of which only the best of the best remain.  And most importantly, we launched two courses of qualified specialists, many of which, after graduation, got jobs at Mail.Ru Group and other large IT companies. <br><br>  A few numbers for all this time: <br><ul><li>  <b>222</b> students </li><li>  <b>37</b> teachers </li><li>  <b>22</b> disciplines </li><li>  <b>89</b> interns for the whole period of Technopark existence </li><li>  <b>35</b> students are currently taking internships at Mail.Ru Group </li><li>  <b>40</b> people have successfully completed an internship and have already moved to the state </li></ul><br>  Everyone loves lists, so here‚Äôs another one - the board of our achievements: <br><ul><li>  We launched open courses and conducted 20 master classes with leading experts from the IT industry; </li><li>  We held the Tehnostart Championship, the winners of which took part in the Russian-Chinese web development competition; </li><li>  Opened a student lab; </li><li>  Spent 2 first graduation. </li></ul><br>  Under the cut more about everything. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  A small flashback in the history of Technopark.  Three years ago, the Mail.Ru Group, together with the Moscow State Technical University named after NE Bauman, opened an educational project that allows senior students and postgraduate students at MGTU to undergo free additional IT training.  Technopark grows specialists in our field: web developers and system architects of high-load systems.  The main task, in short, is to adapt the student to real life.  Speaking in more detail, Technopark provides an opportunity to learn from IT experts, to try their hand at real projects and solve real problems.  The output is experience, many have their own product, someone has a job in leading IT companies.  The project is working, developing and paying off.  This year the Technopark program was included in the ‚ÄúCatalog of the best educational programs of RAEC‚Äù.

    <h1>  How it works? </h1><br>  The main program of the course is designed for 2 years and includes 22 disciplines.  The first year of study is devoted to acquiring skills in the development of web services.  The second year is a special discipline aimed at developing the competence of a system architect.  Teaching at Technopark is mainly employees of Mail.Ru Group.  Also last year, we began to attract specialists from other IT companies, for example, from Kaspersky Lab, who supplemented our program of open courses, but more on that later. <br><br><h1>  How to proceed? </h1><br>  Recruitment to the Technopark takes place 2 times a year: in September and in February.  Over the past three years, the competition for a place has grown threefold - from two to six people.  The selection takes place in two stages.  The first stage is online testing.  The second is a technical interview conducted by one of the Technopark teachers.  You can find out more details, find examples of assignments and (if you are a student at MSTU) submit an application for entrance examinations on <a href="https://tech-mail.ru/page/forapplicants">the Technopark</a> official <a href="https://tech-mail.ru/page/forapplicants">website</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1b9/ab4/b01/1b9ab4b013784eea9cfcdbe78c64a6ca.jpg"><br><br>  Over the past year, a lot of interesting events have happened in the Technopark, we will tell about some of them now. <br><br><h1>  Open Courses </h1><br>  Now anyone who fails to go through all the stages of entering the Technopark can listen to a whole course in a particular discipline.  At the beginning of the year, we launched two such courses: ‚ÄúUnity 3D‚Äù and ‚ÄúIT Project Management‚Äù.  The students liked the format of the courses very much, so a new course on basic Linux administration was launched from the new year.  Technopark also invited colleagues from Kaspersky Lab to cooperate to conduct a course on vulnerability analysis. <br><br><h1>  Training courses </h1><br>  Not only students of specialized departments can (and want) to study at the Technopark.  However, students often do not have enough knowledge for the desired passing score, and above all knowledge of C / C ++.  For them, we have launched courses where you can pull up knowledge and prepare for admission.  The program initially started as an experiment, and following the results of the entrance tests, it became clear that it was a success: Dmitry Merkuriyev, a law student, received the highest passing score. <br><br><h1>  Championship Technostart </h1><br>  Another very important project for us that we launched at the end of May is Technostart.  The purpose of this championship is to create a web service that will improve student life.  Take part in the championship could any student MGTU them.  Bauman, in the end got about 250 people and 46 projects.  The prize went to the <a href="http://techno-start.ru/projects/26">Mobile University</a> application, which makes life easier for the student, helping to navigate the university, work with the timetable and learn the latest news.  The second and third place was taken by the application for broadcasting music under iOS " <a href="http://techno-start.ru/projects/40">NULLA</a> " and "ABM entrant", which helps the incoming to choose a department in the <a href="http://techno-start.ru/projects/38">Moscow State Technical University.</a>  <a href="http://techno-start.ru/projects/38">Bauman</a> .  A list of other competitive projects can be found on the Technostart website in the ‚Äú <a href="http://techno-start.ru/">Ideas</a> ‚Äù section. <br><br>  Technostart's experience inspired us to introduce the practice of graduation projects in the Technopark itself.  Now students are graduating from Technopark not only with a diploma, but also with a completed project, which will later be considered by their potential employers or will become the basis of their own startup. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0b3/9d8/7a2/0b39d87a21eb42dd869bebf16f4b6403.jpg"><br><br><h1>  Competition Russia vs China </h1><br>  By the way, the history of the <a href="http://techno-start.ru/projects/26">Mobile University</a> project that won in the Techno Start continued beyond the competition.  The Technostart team led by Technopark student Nikolai Chameyev went to the mobile application development contest for students of Russian and Chinese universities.  The project took fourth place;  If we take into account that the other teams had about a year to prepare, and our team only had two weeks, the results are impressive.  Now we are tracking student championships in which technoparkov and tehnostartov can participate. <br><br><h1>  Summer school </h1><br>  This year, Technopark held its first summer courses, which were attended by about 80 students.  The course on information security was held by Yaroslav Rabovolyuk - head of the information security department at Mail Ru Group.  Assignments completed as part of the course, read to students as a summer practice.  This summer we plan to supplement the list of departments (and faculties) and expand our summer school. <br><br><h1>  First two issues </h1><br>  Polishing the Technopark program, we largely focused on students' reviews: asked what they were missing, analyzed the results of tests and exams.  The first releases of Technopark made the greatest contribution to the formation of the program - and today we want to thank the guys who became pioneers. <br><br>  Today, there are 31 graduates in our account.  At the first graduation, the whole Technopark team (students, teachers, organizers) went to Sochi.  With the second year graduates of the Mail.Ru Group CEO Dmitry Grishin (he, by the way, also a graduate of the Moscow State Technical University named after Bauman) held a round table where everyone could ask his question and get feedback. <br><br>  For three years we have come a long way.  Our graduates work in leading IT companies in Russia, and we are proud of them.  Ahead we have new championships, the embodiment of plans and new achievements. <br><br>  PS In the comments we invite habravchan to share memories of the courses that you took.  What was the most useful, what was not useful at all, what was missing?  We attentively listen and write down - and, perhaps, we will embody something from your experience in the Technopark. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3a3/594/003/3a35940038b54c8eb85e35b9fb0305d3.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/250219/">https://habr.com/ru/post/250219/</a></p>
