  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Platform 2010 from the inside. Part 2</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On the second day, we decided not to sit up on the reports and see what was around. <br><br>  Next to the red hall there were two laboratory classes.  One could be called general-purpose, the other was devoted to Exchange Server 2010. This year, visiting labs was possible only by prior request on the site.  This approach has a significant drawback: the registered participant may not come, and the place will be empty.  Nobody came to the test drive of the Office server solutions.  Probably the coffee break had a relaxing effect on IT professionals.  Microsoft employees quickly looked around and gave us an individual workshop on the topic, which Sharepoint can be useful for students and educational institutions.  It was very interesting, I even had an idea to read the same report with us at the VMK MSU. <br><br>  Nadezhda Altynova from the Microsoft Office Solution Center treated me with a carrot with the Microsoft Technology Centers logo in an e-mail package with sealing wax.  In my opinion, these were heard at an event a couple of weeks ago.

Virtual machines for tasks are run on three IBM X3850M2 servers with four six-core 64-bit processors and 96 GB of RAM on board.  IBM DS4700 disk arrays (16 x 72 GB) and IBM EX810 (16 x 146 GB), and also an external USB screw.  The shelves are connected by two Fiber Channel interfaces through a Brocade switch.  As the test drive showed, such capacities were not fully mastered, but everything worked quickly. <br><br>  The ‚Äúhighlight‚Äù of the exhibition deployed in the lobby was the Windows Embedded booth.  Gunter Fisher and Julia Haber from German Microsoft demonstrated a robot from KUKA Robotics (see video).  They say that a real sample working in production was brought to the conference.  It was developed not at all for drawing, therefore it displays letters not in a row, but in a spiral. <br><br><img src="http://img688.imageshack.us/img688/7868/kukarobot.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the way to dinner, looked at a certification authority.  It also welcomed only pre-registered members, and there were few free promo codes, unlike the previous Platform, where anyone could take the test. <br><br>  At 19:00 there was a closing and razyshrysh prizes.  Played gift certificates to the online store of software, mice, webcams and HTC communicator. <br><br>  Although the opinions of the participants were divided, in general, we can say that the Platform was a success.  In comparison with the labyrinths of the Academy of Sciences, in the WTC it was more convenient.  The overall level of organization also increased, there was a very high-quality food (and the ‚ÄúSoviet‚Äù lunch tickets finally disappeared).  Among the shortcomings, as I wrote above, is the ill-conceived registration system for labs, weak WiFi, a small number of codes for free certification, and the conference date, which coincides with the date of TechEd Europe (some people from IT left there). <br><br>  In conclusion, I would like to thank the organizers, the speakers who took the time to comment, and all those who helped in the work on the attached video. <br><br>  Denis Mandrov, Irina Ponomareva, Ekaterina Aksenova for <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/">habrahabr.ru</a> <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/om74e04Ik0o%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhibFQZMKIh7XR0Pemj_9XXt0725Pw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/75194/">https://habr.com/ru/post/75194/</a></p>
