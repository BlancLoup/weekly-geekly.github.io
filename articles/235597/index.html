If you carefully follow the instructions, a very interesting thing turns out: a slight change in the interface and output information logic can lead to a significant change in the conversion, if you multiply all the conversion numbers under such a cat, you can get a 2-fold increase. <br><br>  I already imagine dozens or even hundreds of webmasters and managers who check every project change with the help of A / B tests, order an audit in usability laboratories and wait for the growth of conversions to notorious 2 times.  What is actually happening - let's see ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In fact, the A / B test is a common statistical experiment and fully complies with all the rules of statistics.  According to these rules, the notion of a ‚Äúchange in conversion of 17%‚Äù cannot exist. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">For those who are interested in the rationale</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  It may exist: change in conversion by 17% with a confidence interval of 10% (in this case, the change is significant). <br><br>  And maybe so: a change in conversion of 17% with a confidence interval of 20% (in this case, the change is insignificant).

      What variables need to know to change the differences with a confidence interval? <br><br>  1) The size of the control groups (introductory: 95% confidence interval, statistical power 80%); <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d30/961/b22/d30961b228fb450d83b041264dfd570c.gif" alt="Formula for measuring the size of control groups">  where <br><br>  where Œ¥ is the minimum detectable effect in%; <br><br>  p - basic conversion <br><br>  n is the number of participants in each group. <br><br>  Then for the base conversion of 2% and a change of 17% (0.34%) you need: <br><br>  n = (16 * 0.02 * (1-0.0034)) / 0.0034¬≤ = 27731 participants in each group, in order to fix the change significant. <br><br>  2) Confidence interval: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b33/635/3fc/b336353fc380413896db7c94199308e2.gif">  where <br><br>  p - basic conversion <br><br>  n is the number of participants in each group. <br><br>  z - 2 for 95% accuracy, 3 for 99.8% accuracy <br><br>  An example of a confidence interval for a conversion of 2%, an accuracy of 95% and a sample size of 10,000: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/774/8b2/ddf/7748b2ddfcfb47fc890a3f090865eac7.gif">  = 0.0028 (0.28%, which means that all values ‚Äã‚Äãobtained during the experiment, but lying between 2.28 and 1.72 are not significant). <br><br>  From this it can be assumed that for most sites on the Runet, conducting A / B tests cannot give a significant result, they simply have little traffic. <br><br>  Although now the majority of SaaS solutions show the results of A / B tests on any and even statistically insignificant sample, a lot of wrong conclusions can be drawn from here. <br></div></div><br>  We were tasked with the top - to learn how to conduct A / B tests and use it all the time. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWhat could be simpler‚Äù - I thought, we divide all traffic by user cookie into even / odd, we hang something in the URL and Ya.metrika or GA themselves will tell the whole truth about testing.  I understand it now - how wrong. <br><br>  We are very lucky.  Our System Architect quickly got acquainted with the materiel and understood everything and made a simple interface for recalculating all the necessary parameters.  We began to measure (for reference - the daily attendance of the site rarely falls below 30,000 unique users): <br><br>  <b>A / B test number 1</b> (Test for the presence of a block of recommendations for the user (I really wanted to start, give life to the project, get leads)): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/64d/0b6/93b/64d0b693b5ea45c086126613a8e7ddfd.png"><br><br>  I look, how to say, ‚Äúaccording to the beacons‚Äù, the Architect writes everything. <br><br>  First day + 10% of leads on the control group with a block, I rub my hands (it smells like a bonus). <br><br>  Second + 9% - we light nothing <br><br>  ... <br><br>  A week passed, on average for beacons - a good + 7%, I finish the A / B test, turn on the unit for all users.  (The architect says, ‚Äúthe interval did not diverge.‚Äù I did not attach any importance to this). <br><br>  <b>A / B test number 2</b> (Test block size recommendations) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ef5/985/ab5/ef5985ab5e894865be9e2a3d1fc7484d.png"><br><br>  They drove the test for more than a month - a significant result - no. <br><br>  We report to the leadership of the voice - learn how to carry out A / B tests - we can count everything.  What does the new task do? And let's make a site like Apple.com with one big picture and a minimalistic menu. <br><br>  <b> /  test ‚Ññ3</b> (Aggregator vs Monobrand) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f88/3b4/5d7/f883b45d7c1c405baf46e917853aa8b5.png"><br><br>  ‚ÄúYou can't do that, we worked so hard on dynamic recommendations - and then hello, like Apple.com‚Äù - there were a lot of emotions, but we had nothing to do - we did something, started the test. <br><br>  The first day and the test page brings more and more - by 13%.  I am terrified, but what about my expertise ... began to bot botch the materiel. <br><br>  The second day - the indicators equaled, I realized that you need to wait. <br><br>  10 days passed, the confidence interval was finally sold, the old page turned out to be really better, but not by several times, but a little bit.  On the overall conversion rate by refrigerator + 12% with a confidence interval of 10%, i.e.  just 2 percent you can be sure or to drive the test further. <br><br>  When carrying out A / B tests, I ask you not to make my mistakes, check the statistical significance of the results, ask how these or other conclusions were made, on the basis of what. <br><br>  P.Y.  A / B tests for projects for the second thousand Russian Alexis is a myth.  Traffic is not enough. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/235597/">https://habr.com/ru/post/235597/</a></p>
