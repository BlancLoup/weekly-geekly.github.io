While the developers were resting and preparing for the new working season, we prepared for the launch of the new service - <a href="http://www.ivanpr.com/ru/apple_iphone_ipad_android_app_promotion.html">Promotion of iPhone, iPad, Android applications</a> through the publication of news announcements and reviews on IT portals and in thematic blogs.  The service covers both Russian-speaking and English-speaking resources.  The desire to participate in the era of the ‚Äúgold rush‚Äù in the Apple Store and the Android Market did not give me peace for a year, but I first wanted to try to promote several mobile applications and offer a new service with real examples of the result so as not to be unfounded. <br><br>  The first mobile application that I had a chance to announce in RuNet was <a href="http://www.bolidesoft.com/rus/filmoteka.html">Filmoteka film cataloger for iPhone and Android</a> .  The program is designed only for the Russian-speaking user and is distributed free of charge as a mobile client of the Windows Movie Catalogizer - All My Movies.  The application synchronizes with the cataloger on the desktop computer, allowing the film lover to have a catalog of their films always at hand on the home computer and on an iPhone or Android smartphone.

The user can view the description of the movie and transfer it to the movie catalog on a mobile device.  In the future, the list of movies can be viewed without connecting to the Internet, which is especially convenient, for example, in a store, so as not to accidentally buy the same film twice.  The application provides the ability to mark movies in the collection.  For example, ‚ÄúI want to watch‚Äù, ‚ÄúI am going to buy‚Äù, etc., and there is also a visual grouping of films by genre and year of release. <br><br>  Briefly talk about the method and results of the promotion. <br><br>  Last fall, I was approached by a developer asking if there was an opportunity to announce an application for mobile.  To which I replied: "Yes."  At that time, I had already compiled a contact list for delivering press releases to the editors of mobile device portals.  In addition, I was going to offer the news in the editorial offices of magazines and news portals, with whom there were already working relationships, because  I have been delivering press releases on Windows shareware programs for several years. <br><br>  I prepared the press release for Filmoteka 1.0 for the iPhone quite quickly - in the evening, using the description on the Bolide Software website and a video presentation on YouTube.  On Sunday, the developer reported that the App Store proapproved the applications and the very next day (November 8, 2010) the news was delivered to the editorial office.  Within two or three days, the first publications on portals appeared. <br><br>  * Press release with the announcement of Filmoteka for iPhone can be downloaded <a href="http://www.ivanpr.com/ru/files/habr/filmoteka/Filmoteka_iPhone_pr_ru.pdf">here</a> (Adobe PDF, 360 Kb) <br>  * Report on the publication of news can be downloaded <a href="http://www.ivanpr.com/ru/files/portfolio/filmoteka_iphone_report.pdf">here</a> (Adobe PDF, 2.21 MB) <br><br>  According to the developer, a week after the announcement, there were ‚Äúabout 11 thousand installations, at the peak there were more than 1900 installations per day, then the program hung for a few days at 9-10 in the Top Free Russian-language AppStore.  Now, of course, it‚Äôs no longer seen in Top25, it‚Äôs logical to fall ‚Äù( <a href="http://bolide-software.blogspot.com/2010/11/filmoteka-iphone.html">Bolide Software blog</a> ) <br><br>  A month later, the Filmoteka for Android appeared, which we also announced with a press release. <br><br>  * Press release with the announcement of Filmoteka for Android can be downloaded <a href="http://www.ivanpr.com/ru/files/habr/filmoteka/Filmoteka_Android_pr_ru.pdf">here</a> (360 Kb) <br>  * Report on the publication of news can be downloaded <a href="http://www.ivanpr.com/ru/files/portfolio/filmoteka_android_report.pdf">here</a> (2.11 MB) <br><br>  Publications have shown that the editors of portals are good at news about mobile applications, especially about free programs for a mass audience of home users.  In addition to the portals, within three months after the news feed about Filmoteka, many blogs about Apple and Android were told.  Whether this is the result of my mailing remains a mystery to me, although the news in these blogs also delivered, but the reviews did not appear immediately, but after several months. <br><br>  If someone has questions on the promotion of iPhone and Android applications on the Runet or on the English-language Internet, welcome to my <a href="http://ivanpr.com/ru/contact/">contact form</a> . <br><br>  Good luck in your promotion! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/127427/">https://habr.com/ru/post/127427/</a></p>
