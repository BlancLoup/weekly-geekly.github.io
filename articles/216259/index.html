  <section class="page js-page"><h1>LG Optimus L1 II: Ultra Budget Segment, Korean Version</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A holiday on March 8 was recently held, and my brother and I decided that this was an excellent opportunity to ‚Äútransfer‚Äù mother from an ordinary push-button telephone to a smartphone.  As it was about her first sensory apparatus, it was decided to donate an entry-level model, that is, the so-called ‚Äústate employee‚Äù.  Unfortunately, at that moment I was absent in the city, so the choice of device completely entrusted to my brother, he himself participated in the process only financially. <br><br>  I do not know what he was guided by, but his choice fell on the LG Optimus L1 II.  After returning home, I drove to my parents and took it for a couple of days - for setting up, updating the firmware and installing software.  Now I want to share my impressions about this device. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e9b/ea8/509/e9bea850964e2c52dca7a9222f135bb8.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I‚Äôll clarify that there is a ‚Äútwo-sided‚Äù version of this model on the market - the LG Optimus L1 II Dual.  In addition to supporting two SIM-cards, it differs from its ‚Äúone-sign‚Äù brother and outwardly (for some reason, LG makes the case of ordinary and ‚Äúdouble-valued‚Äù versions of the same smartphones in different designs), the rest of the characteristics are the same.  Looking ahead a bit, I‚Äôll say that the gadget pleasantly surprised me: despite its ultrabudget price (about 3,000 rubles), it turned out to be better than I expected, although it wasn‚Äôt without serious flaws.

      <br>
      We can safely say that the LG Optimus L1 II has its own face, which cannot be said about most Android backgrounds, and this applies not only to low-end models.  The body of the gadget is made of high-quality plastic of different types: the back part is white-gray textured plastic, the ends are textured gray plastic, and the space above and below the screen is made under polished aluminum.  All parts of the body are well fitted to each other, the device really seems monolithic.  There are no complaints about the build quality. <br><br>  On the front side of the device, as usual, there is a screen covered with protective plastic (it‚Äôs clear that for such a sum it would be foolish to count on glass).  Below the display are four Android touch keys: ‚ÄúBack,‚Äù ‚ÄúHome,‚Äù ‚ÄúMenu,‚Äù and ‚ÄúApplication Manager.‚Äù  This arrangement is not very familiar to me personally, usually the arrow ‚ÄúBack‚Äù is on the right, and the ‚ÄúMenu‚Äù is on the left.  By the way, the key illumination is not here, so in the dark you will have to get at random.  Honestly, it is not entirely clear why it was necessary to save on the backlight, because it is in most ultra-budget smartphones. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c14/f0d/328/c14f0d3282842589c94bde8916422cc2.jpg"><br><br>  Above the screen is a speaker, which is used both for communication and for playing ringtones, sound from videos and musical compositions.  The quality of speech reception / transmission is good, but if you use the speaker, for example, to listen to audio tracks, the quality leaves much to be desired.  Also in the upper part of the front panel there was a place for the proximity sensor, but there is no ambient light sensor and front camera.  Due to the lack of the latter, you can forget about the video calls in Skype.  (It's good that there is at least a proximity sensor, since the main competitor of the LG Optimus L1 II - Samsung Galaxy Star for the same 3,000 rubles - does not have this component either, which is generally beyond the bounds of decency.) <br><br>  The hardware control keys are conveniently located: the screen unlock button on the right side of the upper face, and the volume rocker on the left side. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4c3/f54/b20/4c3f54b20dc55615e07e231397fe24a4.jpg"><br><br>  They slightly rise above the hull and are easy to grope, but at the same time, they have enough ‚Äúresistance‚Äù to eliminate false positives.  Also on the top face of the LG Optimus L1 II is a 3.5mm headphone jack. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4a2/a15/31f/4a2a1531fc53b14a39539804da7bb3f0.jpg"><br><br>  At the bottom there is a microUSB port and a microphone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6c4/35c/3b0/6c435c3b08747ec445965b127c958a00.jpg"><br><br>  On the back side is the camera lens and the manufacturer's logo. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/289/641/507/289641507b6ce3ced17772bc0c35828d.jpg"><br><br>  This can finish the description of the appearance, go to the <b>screen</b> .  LG Optimus L1 II is equipped with a 3-inch display with a resolution of 320 x 240 pixels, the density of pixels per inch (ppi) is 133. The manufacturer's website states that this model uses an IPS-matrix.  Well, I do not know, in practice, I did not notice.  Everyone knows that the distinctive features of this technology are natural color reproduction and wide viewing angles.  If the first is more or less in order, then with the second things are much worse.  When looking at the screen from bottom to top, the picture just brightens, but if you look from top to bottom, the colors are noticeably inverted, and the image becomes dark.  When viewed from the left or right, the picture looks bearable, although some color change is still noticeable.  Honestly, the display could be put better. <br><br>  In general, QVGA resolution has become a rarity.  Therefore, some applications are not "sharpened" for him.  For example, the popular AnTuTu benchmark is not displayed correctly, and the same AnTuTu Tester is ‚Äúnot available for this device‚Äù at all.  Therefore, it was not possible to determine how many simultaneous clicks the tach supports, but exactly more than two. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/12a/4ad/0b2/12a4ad0b2c5d5c57ce52a8155de3de78.png"><br><br>  LG Optimus L1 II is built on a time-tested (read - vintage) <b>single-core Qualcomm MSM7225A processor,</b> which operates at a frequency of up to 1 GHz, while the RAM here is 512 MB.  It is clear that with such a "iron" to demand from the smartphone something special should not be, but still the device copes with most basic everyday tasks.  The interface works smartly, and the applications open quickly enough. <br><br>  Moreover, even in unpretentious toys to play it will turn out.  For the sake of experiment, I installed Angry Birds;  what can I say, the birds really "fly" in all senses, the smartphone did not even think to "slow down".  But this is probably the maximum: no 3D games. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d8b/928/5e2/d8b9285e2149202596c2e7b5f8e0cca9.png"><br><br>  The amount of internal memory is 4 GB, plus there is a slot for microSD-card.  All the necessary wireless modules in the LG Optimus L1 II are present - this is Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS, as well as an FM receiver.  They all work properly. <br><br>  The operating system in the LG Optimus L1 II uses <b>Android 4.1.2 Jelly Bean</b> .  The interface has been significantly reworked, the smartphone uses the proprietary Optimus UI shell, and it looks all really nice.  In addition to the modified view of the menu, submenus and icons, the shell includes several interesting applications.  Here and the design, and the ability to select effects on the screen, font size and type, and much more.  Changed and unlock screen.  For example, it displays four customizable icons for quick access to the necessary applications. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2b0/79f/76f/2b079f76f53e05321183ad2e8e7d0125.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/495/73c/736/49573c7369e8da603d269cb2e484effe.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ccf/c5b/1f7/ccfc5b1f73d6d09e1f934deff2dfbc72.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/961/01a/82a/96101a82a2cceaeecadf3d453df2ab5e.png"><br><br>  In the upper curtain there are icons for turning on wireless modules, data synchronization, ‚ÄúOn the plane‚Äù mode, ‚ÄúAccess point‚Äù (when the smartphone acts as a router), power saving mode, QuickMemo (a proprietary program for creating screenshots and working with them) and much more.  Conveniently, all this can also be configured by adding or removing one or another "switch".  Here (in the upper curtain) is the ability to adjust the brightness of the screen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9b7/e97/e3b/9b7e97e3b33e8ca70ad4f6504101756b.png"><br><br>  As in the more expensive LG models, the LG Optimus L1 II has a widely advertised KnockOn function that allows you to turn on / off the screen without pressing the hardware key - you just need to double tap on the display. <br><br>  Also liked the ability to display the battery charge in percent.  In general, these pleasant little things in the LG Optimus L1 II enough. <br><br>  <b>From the preinstalled programs,</b> I‚Äôll mention the client of the LG AppClub corporate application catalog, the file manager, the text editor Polaris Viewer 4, the LG Smart World, the Remote Call Service (a program for remote diagnostics of the device) and the Safety Care application.  I will tell about the last in more detail.  Since the LG Optimus L1 II belongs to the ultrabudget class, it is also aimed at the elderly and children.  In the Safety Care program, you can configure the automatic forwarding of an outgoing call during an emergency call to a specified number.  Also, the device can notify selected subscribers about the inactivity of the smartphone for a specified time, and most importantly, send a message about your location. <br><br>  Yes, I almost forgot: the device has the ability to <b>download updates over the air</b> from, and immediately after the purchase, he offered to download and install two updates. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/349/6c2/142/3496c2142dc8a4cd5c518a329563621d.png"><br><br>  <b>Camera</b> in LG Optimus L1 II 2-megapixel.  It is clear that this smartphone does not claim to be a camera, the quality of photos is very mediocre.  Here are some examples: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/65d/d70/cff/65dd70cffc4d1ebb11fbea5c8d7c3280.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/46a/474/936/46a474936bb9c7db2bec1ce2150383fd.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1db/159/06e/1db15906e80d1cf243d1ff882835c623.jpg"><br><br>  The camera interface is different from the standard application of the Android operating system, there are many settings.  It is even a shame that for such a lousy camera, frankly, there are so many options.  Of the interesting, I would note the possibility of activating the ‚Äúshutter‚Äù by the spoken word. <br><br>  <b>Battery</b> LG Optimus L1 II has a capacity of 1 540 mAh.  The smartphone confidently "lives" on the same charge for 2 days on average usage mode.  During his acquaintance with his smartphone (remember, this is her first touchscreen device) and he carefully studied it for about a day and a half, which is quite good. <br><br>  <b>To summarize</b> .  In general, the device is not bad, both for the ultra-budget class, but it also has enough weaknesses.  For example, the lack of a front camera, light sensor and key illumination.  I would also like to see in it a better display.  Probably, if you choose from models of first-tier brands within 3-4 thousand rubles, then the LG Optimus L1 II will be one of the best.  But if you compare it with devices from the same local Russian brands, "Ski" will frankly merge.  Take, for example, the Highscreen Zera F. It costs 1 thousand rubles more (3 990 rubles), but it also has a 4-inch IPS-screen with a resolution of 800 x 480 pixels, a 2-core 1.2-GHz processor, 1 GB RAM, 5-megapixel main and 0.3-megapixel front camera, as well as a more recent version of Android - 4.2.  However, in any case, you should choose: a ‚Äúsimple‚Äù device from a well-known brand or a gadget with more interesting characteristics, but with a less well-known name.  From myself I can only note that in the budget class A-brands are already in the role of catch-up. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/216259/">https://habr.com/ru/post/216259/</a></p>
