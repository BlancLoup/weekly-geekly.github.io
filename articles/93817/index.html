  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Incomprehensible pricing from Google Apps</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><habracut>  Exactly a year ago, they moved from <b>Microsoft Exchange</b> to <b>Google Apps</b> .  We decided to connect the paid version immediately.  For those who do not know or did not know the cost of using the paid version of google apps per year $ 50 per connected user.  It just so happened that in parallel I connected another google apps account for personal use and there I decided to pay nothing. <br>  A year has passed and now it is possible to draw some conclusions about the expediency of payment in comparison with the free version: <br><br>  In the paid version you are given 25 gig for storing data by email, in the free 7 gig.  For the year without deleting anything, I used 2% of the allocated quota on the paid version and also 2% on the free one. <br>  In the paid version, you have constant round-the-clock technical support by phone and e-mail to solve critical problems, which I never took advantage of since there were no reasons. <br>  In the paid version you have a google warranty for uninterrupted operation for 99.9% of the time.  Okay and what?  With free, too, never any problems and there were no failures. <br>  In the <b>Support and Reliability</b> section, I read a clause from them: ‚ÄúInternet support for self-service‚Äù against which there was a tick, indicating that the paid version even has this.  What it is and what it is eaten with so far. <br>  Also, a distinctive feature of the paid version is the presence of the Postini antispam filter, which constantly composted my brains without intermittent soap even inside the domain. <br>  Synchronization of contacts, calendars, mail with mobile works both there and there without problems. <br>  More than any differences found. <br><br>  What unpleasantly surprised in the paid version is that after the first paid user you can no longer add freebies, you will have to pay for everyone in this account.  Since we are 22 people, it‚Äôs not difficult to calculate how much we paid Google for the year.  But in the free version up to 50 people in the domain can work without any problems. <br>  From this month we stopped paying for our account and did not feel any difference.  So I have a question: How did a company like google make such stupid pricing for its product?  And is it stupid or is there a catch that I never saw?  They gave me the value as a consumer, but if compared with the free version, I don‚Äôt understand what I should pay for, if everything is the same for free. <br>  Really for "Internet support for self-service"? <br>  By the way, I am completely satisfied with the move from Microsoft Excange to Google Apps.  Products from google, as always, pleased and continue to delight. </habracut></div>
