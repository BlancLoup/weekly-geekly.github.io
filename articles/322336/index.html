In 2016, <a href="http://comfortway.com/">I fought with the Romain and won</a> , and looked at SaaS with one eye and that's what I saw. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Sentence </h3><br>  Offering cloud services rolls over.  In 2016, the respected site <a href="https://startpack.ru/application/startpack">startpack.ru</a> added 552 services.  SaaS has ceased to be something incomprehensible to consumers. <br><br>  I recall that in its Cloud Computing Hype Cycle diagram (cloud maturity cycle) for 2015, Gartner placed SaaS at the Plateau of Productivity point, a plateau of productivity, and this is the final stage of development at which the technology is applied everywhere.

      <br>
      According to bcsg.com, 60% of SMB companies already use SaaS and 78% of respondents plan to buy SaaS in 2017.  These are indicators of a survey of 600 companies, and I think metrics can be projected onto the Russian market with some kind of insignificant reduction factor.  UPD - A decreasing use factor of about 0.8 compared to current survey data on iksmedia.ru.  In a rather conservative segment of medicine according to our research ( <a href="https://dentalcloud.pro/">Dentalcloud</a> ), 60% of dentists are already using cloud services and the most popular service, attention is Google Forms. <br><br><h3>  Trends </h3><br>  Most development companies take understandable approaches to development - development of a platform (1C) or API and integration.  An interesting case of the year - vendors of integrations appear on the Russian market.  For example, UniSender and Bitrix24 <a href="https://pinall.ru/sale/prilozhenie-integratsiya-unisender-i-bitrix24/">Pinall</a> microservice integration declares integration as an independent product and talks about thousands of installations. <br><br>  A global example of an API service like SaaS - Enrichment API, which is interesting from the point of view of implementing the API itself - it can be used without programming skills.  The essence of the service is not obvious, from the point of view of value - search, collection and addition of contact data from everywhere. <br><br>  Last year, the development of niche stories became apparent.  So for the 2015-2016 year in the segment of the automation of dentistry, in which I play with <a href="http://dentaltap.com/">DentalTap</a> , 5 new players have appeared.  At the same time, the traditional leaders of the segment are still not in a hurry to go to the cloud, which is very strange. <br><br><h3>  Newbies </h3><br>  2016 was not without surprises - the global market for tight integration with Google left a service for organizing workflow processes <a href="http://www.kanbanchi.com/">Kanbanchi</a> , which is being developed by Saratov web-studio Lar Team.  The application is used by 165 thousand people and it is developed on the API "Google Drive".  Fine, really! <br><br><h3>  Large </h3><br>  At the very end of 2015, Parallels forked and partially sold Ingram Micro.  Odin Service Automation products have become a private cloud-oriented box.  Together with such a reversal, the story ended with a series of attempts at construction by banks and SaaS-marketplace operators, since it was Parallles that was the main driver of such construction on the Russian market. <br><br>  Now big players are playing in the field of BPaaS - Rostelecom has been actively promoting this kind of service on thematic events throughout the year.  The national cloud platform O7 has been enriched with the offer of virtual infrastructure and nothing new has emerged from SaaS. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/888/3ea/02a/8883ea02a0274904a19baaad5d2b0000.png"></div><br><br>  Bilay in 2016 created and already in February 2017 launched a bundle of cloud services for businesses.  Some cloud stakeholders <a href="https://www.facebook.com/antonsalov/posts/1096605813799063%3Fpnref%3Dstory">call the step</a> true unified communications, but my opinion is that the ‚Äúperfect bundle‚Äù will necessarily break about the needs of the microbusiness itself and competing independent services.  Whether the approach to the construction of the proposal around the base value will help - time will tell mobile and look. <br><br><h3>  Opinions </h3> <br>  As usual, I invited the best cloud colleagues - market participants who perfectly showed events and trends in SaaS for 2016. <br><br>  <b>Katerina Kostereva</b> <br>  CEO <a href="https://www.terrasoft.ru/">Terrasoft</a> <br>  According to IDS, SaaS is growing 5 times faster than the traditional software market.  According to Gartner, this year in the world it will grow by 20% compared with the previous period, and this trend will continue for the next 3-5 years.  According to our observations, the Russian SaaS market does not lag behind the world trends, and this year it is even slightly ahead of them, showing an increase of more than 25%.  Terrasoft cloud service sales growth only confirms these trends. <br><br>  In addition, the enormous development of the technology itself is affecting the cloud market.  Intelligent business processes, predictive analytics tools, integration with IoT, big data - all of these technologies require powerful computing resources and the ability to quickly scale to meet the ever-growing demands of the business.  Of course, only the largest enterprises can afford to support the necessary infrastructure locally.  While the cloud provides the company with the necessary resources, removing the headache regarding server performance and availability, security, speed, and many other similar issues. <br><br>  <b><a href="https://www.facebook.com/antonsalov%3Ffref%3Dnf">Anton Salov</a></b> <br>  Organizing Committee of the Russian Cloud Computing Professional Association <br>  If we talk about the results of 2016, then the year as a whole was a success.  The growth was about 30%.  Traditional segments were actively growing - applications for communications and collaboration, as well as the near-accounting segment.  BPaaS moved the SaaS market and it‚Äôs difficult to estimate where the earnings of the cloud software itself are, and where the business and processes built around and based on the cloud software are. <br><br>  Office 365 was actively strengthening its position and gaining an audience, kanibaliziruya intra-office (on-Premise) business infrastructure.  His import-substituting alternative, <a href="https://myoffice.ru/">MoiOffice</a> , also pleased with a number of high-profile releases and projects + hosting announcement on Servers.ru (by the way, it seems the first and only SaaS).  It should be noted the consolidation of many relatively successful SaaS-projects around 1C: AmoCRM was added to Megaplan, My Warehouse and Umi.  She outdid the "frank" marketing of Megaplan of past years, in terms of efficiency and scale.  Stadium conferences and industry telephone calls of potential customers may not have brought new customers in the expected size, but Boris Nuraliev‚Äôs attention was definitely attracted. <br><br>  <b>Askar Rakhimberdiev</b> <br>  CEO <a href="https://www.moysklad.ru/">MoySklad</a> <br>  In my area (trade automation) in 2016, the state asked for trends.  Retail is now required to connect to the Unified State Automated Information System (if we sell alcohol) or the so-called Shubais (furs and coats).  September 1, 2016 launched the most ambitious state project - transfer all cash desks to online.  It is important that all these government systems operate in the cloud.  As a result, during 2017-2018 almost all retail outlets will need to be connected to the Internet.  Thus, the state forcedly resolved one of the obstacles for the spread of clouds - the need for online.  Now online has become legally binding. <br><br>  <b><a href="">Andrey Kolesov</a></b> <br>  PCWeek Journalist <br>  I asked Andrew to speak on the issue of "SaaS and the State", but he posted the opinion in his blog ( <a href="https://www.pcweek.ru/ecm/blog/its/9293.php">full version</a> ).  Thesis: <br><br>  In fact, the main aspect of clouds is the regulation of the relationship between the consumer and the supplier.  Here, indeed, there are issues that the current legislation is not very described.  We need new regulations, they are waiting for the state, which is important to work "according to the law."  But these acts are not. <br><br>  Let me remind you that the Ministry of Communications and Mass Media still had two (or already three?) Years preparing the ‚Äúcloud law‚Äù (specifically for the state), but, as far as I know, it wasn‚Äôt like it or not. <br><br>  Regulatory requirements - this is important for the public sector.  Efficiency, etc. - this is already deeply secondary.  What problems are visible here. <br><br>  1. Today, in fact, regulatory requirements foreign clouds are cut off from the public sector.  Even if there are no explicit restrictions, everyone understands that foreign things are not a modern trend, and you don‚Äôt even need to think about it. <br><br>  2. "Burned on the water, blowing on the water."  The analogy with the western clouds automatically applies to domestic clouds - it‚Äôs better not to get involved with this.  Even if there are no formal prohibitions. <br><br>  <b>Alexey Fedorov</b> <br>  CEO <a href="https://startpack.ru/application/startpack">startpack.ru</a> <br>  Using SaaS in the work becomes commonplace.  Users do not need classic arguments about the benefits of the cloud approach, their attention is shifting to the study of consumer properties of products and the search for reasons why you should stay in the current service or why you should change it to another.  The trend of 2016 is SaaS solutions for corporate chats and bots.  Bots will continue to improve in the direction of artificial intelligence.  Their development will be in demand in corporate helpdesk, customer support, personal assistants and concierge services. <br><br>  The market is oversaturated with services that solve universal tasks that are not related to a specific industry: CRM, task management, cloud storage.  Each category has its own hard-to-reach leaders, and in the total mass it is difficult to distinguish one service from another - the opportunities provided are identical.  It is impossible to stand out or compete in such an environment, therefore more and more services appear that specialize in certain business sectors: CRM for a dental clinic, task management for a courier company, etc. <br><br>  The direction of narrow specialization will develop deeper, down to atomic app-s created by teams of 2-3 people, SaaS-add-ons and add-ons, and even just a bare API.  Mobile First's SaaS strategy will also be affected by specialization, the availability of a mobile application that replicates the capabilities of the web version of the service is no longer enough, mobile versions of services will expand the functionality of mobile devices.  The narrow specialization of services is a consequence of the proliferation of the SaaS market, where the blue ocean strategy is the only way to survive. <br><br><h3>  Content </h3><br>  For mature businesses, the Terrasof Days CRM is always excellent - a lot of new, client cases and a little frank pop music. <br><br>  I can't help noting the <a href="https://startpack.ru/application/startpack">startpack.ru</a> site, which helps users compare SaaS services and hope that colleagues transform the site into something bigger and the second site created on the author's enthusiasm - the personal blog <a href="http://debaka.ru/">debaka.ru</a> , where you can write a free review about your service. <br><br>  From the new ‚ÄúDigital Peaks‚Äù <a href="http://digital-summit.ru/">forum</a> is another initiative of <a href="https://1c.ru/">1C</a> , the Academy of National Economy under the President of the Russian Federation and Mail.ru.  The format is familiar and dominated by yellow colors.  Within the framework of the event there is a contest of projects without prizes. <br><br>  Unified Register of Russian programs for electronic computers and databases.  I finally understand how the registry differs from the directory.  In the latter there is a categorization, i.e.  You type "SaaS" and you get the expected result.  So far all this is not a catalog around which nothing interesting happens. <br><br>  We look at 2017 with optimism! <br><br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/272755/">Review 2015</a> <br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/quickme/blog/225561/">Review 2014</a> <br><br>  Previous publications by: <br><br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/evseyfaydo/topics/">Habrahabr</a> <br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/evseyfaydo/topics/">Geektimes</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/322336/">https://habr.com/ru/post/322336/</a></p>
