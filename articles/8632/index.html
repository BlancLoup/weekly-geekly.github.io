First of all, I congratulate you on the completion of the project. <br><br>  FanLib: - Hello, thank you.  Actually the project is not finished yet.  The library is at the stage of open beta testing, as is evident from our news feed.  And this is really the beta stage, and not a tribute to the WEB2.0 projects mod - to have Beta inscription above the portal logo.

      I: - Judging by the news and the forum - are you ready to pay visitors money for bugs found? <br><br>  FanLib: - Not only are we ready, but we pay.  About hundreds of bugs were found by the readers themselves in the open and closed beta tests phase. <br><br>  Me: - Are there many bugs :)?  And how ethical is it to pay money for it? <br><br>  FanLib: - Any work must be paid.  And how many?  This is a question rather to the developers, and indeed the portal is complex.  Oddly enough, the money agrees to accept no more than a third of readers who have found a bug.  The rest just like to participate in the creation of the library, to see their recommendations embodied on the portal.  After all, we are informed not only about bugs, but also give interesting ideas.  Many of these ideas are being implemented right now, others are being put on the ToDo sheet, to work on the next version. <br><br>  Me: - Do you position the library as a WEB2.0 project? <br><br>  FanLib: - Yes, of course.  Our portal provides a number of services to visitors, and the content of the site is mostly built by the readers themselves. <br><br>  Me: - Content, is it a book? <br><br>  FanLib: And books too.  Important library contents are also reviews, reviews, and a forum with a chat.  On books - scanning, converting and reading books, the process is long and time consuming.  In order to publish updates daily, either staff is required, or the help of the readers themselves.  We are planning both material gratitude for OSR'shchikov, and not material - additional services and statuses. <br><br>  Me: - Can you reveal some more details? <br><br>  FanLib: - For material thanks - at this stage I can not say more.  Software services and status - a little talk.  Active readers write on the forum, leave reviews and send books - this affects their status in the library.  The size of a personal bookshelf, a shelf of books read, stature of authority grows, awards are issued, and even - the percentage of displayed advertising for a given user drops to 0. <br><br>  Me: - Interesting and intriguing - bookshelf, credibility, percentage of advertising ... Can you learn more about the services provided by the library? <br><br>  FanLib: - In order to tell about all the services, you will have to publish the full TZ.  But about some - I can tell in the framework of the interview.  Each library reader has their own personal section on the portal - a personal account.  One of the sections of the LC is the Bookshelf - a service that allows you to store selected books in your personal section.  I will quote myself: ‚Äú... it often happens that while reading one book, I found another interesting one, and I would like to put it somewhere aside so as not to lose, but not to look for a long time later, when there is time to read.  Or just make your own small virtual library, which is always available on the Internet.  Put on the shelf you like, or need to work / study books. <br>  Moreover, at will, books on the shelf can be made visible to other readers.  Then it is enough to send a friend a link to your bookshelf, and the person will receive a list of your books.  Maybe they just wanted to brag or tell what they were reading, or it might have taken to transfer the list of necessary literature to a colleague.  It is also interesting to see what a person reads the reviews of which you liked - what if there is an interesting unread book? .. ‚Äù <br>  The shelf of the books read is the same in function as the manual, only intended accordingly for the books read. <br>  The system of authorities is mainly growing due to the evaluation by other users of reviews left by the reader.  It will allow to give weight to reviews of some readers, and easier applies to reviews of others. <br>  A powerful search system ‚Äî tops of books, authors, users, recent reviews, and an interesting function ‚Äî the advice of a librarian ‚Äî is a system based on reader ratings looking for other users with similar tastes, and gives recommendations for reading books based on their ratings. <br>  Well, much more :) Come, see for yourself. <br><br>  I: - Required.  Now a little about library matters.  It is rumored that your library is a child of the company Liters - i.e.  the prototype of the future of the combined libraries.  This is true? <br><br>  FanLib: - Heh ... Status - a prototype of future joint libraries - we like it :) But if we are a child of liters, no, it is not.  Work on the portal began about a year ago.  Then nobody heard about Lithuania. <br><br>  I: - How do you feel about the fact that, like all libraries at the moment, they are pirated? <br><br>  FanLib: - We are not at all tempted by the label of pirates, and even more we don‚Äôt like the feeling that we are using the fruits of the writers' work and at the same time we don‚Äôt have the opportunity to thank them financially.  We are looking for a solution that will allow to keep the online libraries alive, leave access to them to the maximum possible circle of readers, but at the same time will carry material returns to the authors. <br><br>  I: - Interesting.  Can you give more details? <br><br>  FanLib: - At this stage, no.  Too much at the development stage and can change at any time. <br><br>  Me: - Well, thanks anyway.  Good luck and development of the project! <br><br>  FanLib: - Thank you. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/8632/">https://habr.com/ru/post/8632/</a></p>
