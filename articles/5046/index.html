  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Retail is starting to introduce Web 2.0</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The famous American chain of stores Macy's opened the <a href="http://macys.com/">site for communication</a> six months ago.  Now 350 new reviews appear on it every day, <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/print/bwdaily/dnflash/content/feb2007/db20070213_626293.htm">BusinessWeek writes</a> .  Buyers there communicate and give each other advice on a particular product (for example, how to wash clothes of a particular model).  In fact, the site has become a social network that lives its own life. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Retailers are keenly catching fashion.  They see that the younger generation of teenagers are like advanced Internet users and adore sites like <a href="http://www.myspace.com/">MySpace</a> .  Do not feed them with bread, but let them express their opinion.  That is why retailers open such sites.  Here, customers can share their opinions, rate products, publish their photos and videos. <br><br>  Some online stores are creative.  For example, a fishing tackle store can arrange a contest for the best photo of its goods with caught fish. <br><br>  Previously, marketing firms spent years studying public opinion.  For example, commissioned by Procter &amp; Gamble, multi-week studies were conducted on how women use laundry detergent or skin cream.  Consumer behavior has been studied in detail.  The company even forced women to tie video cameras to their heads during their multi-week research.  Now, consumers themselves are ready to share this most valuable information about personal experience using products.  It is necessary only to create comfortable conditions for the exchange of opinions on the Internet.

      Consumer reviews have long been an integral part of advanced online stores such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/">Amazon.com</a> .  Only in 2006, this practice spread to other stores.  As of the end of 2006, about 43% of all online stores had the functions of ratings and reviews.  This is almost two times more than the year before, when there were only 23% (MarketingSherpa statistics). <br><br>  A survey of buyers aged 18‚Äì34 showed that every second of them left a review or review of a product on the Internet that he used.  Naturally, such a high percentage is associated with the popularity of social networks and blogs, where people are accustomed to express their opinions on absolutely any reason. <br><br>  Studies have shown that on the website of an online store, buyers are more likely to buy a product that has positive feedback than a product from the bestseller list or on sale.  Moreover, 47% of buyers necessarily need some kind of consultation before purchasing a product.  Feedback from other buyers and this is the very advice, that is, they in any case increase the turnover of the online store. <br><br>  The main reason why stores do not open feedback to customers on their sites is the fear of negative reviews.  But studies show that in almost any online store 80% of reviews will always be positive.  Such is human psychology.  A rare negative reviews only help the store to eliminate the flaws in their work, which also will benefit him.  Moreover, the ability to leave a negative review on the site reduces the number of returns of goods to the store! <br><br>  The positive effect of online rankings is so great for retailers that some stores even think of displaying ratings directly in offline trading rooms. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/5046/">https://habr.com/ru/post/5046/</a></p>
