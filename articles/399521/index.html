  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Lenovo P2: 5100 mAh and 3 days without recharging</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  You can talk a lot about cool cameras and incredible performance of smartphones, but it all becomes useless at the very moment when their battery is discharged in the middle of the day.  We know that very many users do not like this, and we know that often it is good autonomy that becomes the decisive factor in choosing. <br><br>  If this is about you, then we advise you to pay attention to our new flagship of the ‚Äúbattery‚Äù series of smartphones - Lenovo P2 with a 5100 mAh battery.  But the capacious battery is not the only advantage of the gadget, which very soon will begin to be sold in Russia. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/caf/fa2/628/caffa262806348f5bb351068aeaf3a93.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <font color="#d8291e">Appearance</font> </h2><br>  A battery with a capacity of 5100 mAh inside the smartphone is a serious thing.  Although this is a key advantage of the Lenovo P2, it is still very important that a large battery does not turn the phone into an ugly ‚Äúbrick‚Äù, as sometimes happens.  Our designers, together with the engineers, made every effort to ensure that the appearance of the P2 did not even remind of its belonging to the class of long-lived smartphones.

      The case of the device is metal, only in the upper and lower parts of the rear panel there are small plastic inserts for the correct operation of the wireless modules.  If you are accustomed to using smartphones with a large diagonal, then discomfort during the use of P2 will not arise.  The body is wide, but snug.  And in the hands does not slip at all. <br><br>  Last year's Lenovo P1 was equipped with a 5000 mAh battery, weighed 189 grams, and the case thickness was 9.9 mm.  In the new Lenovo P2 100 mAh more, while the weight and thickness are 177 and 8.3 mm.  That is such a pleasant progress.  Our employees, who regularly used the previous model, say that it has become much more convenient. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/48e/ac5/82b/48eac582b4ff4545a4aa524497bb5e3b.jpg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#d8291e">Buttons and fingerprint scanner</font> </h2><br>  The rectangular element under the screen is a mechanical Home button and a fingerprint scanner in combination.  It works very quickly and accurately, and the key to unlock it is not necessary to press, and you can put your finger on the sensor at any angle. <br><br>  At the same time, the classic trio of Android-buttons ‚ÄúMenu‚Äù, ‚ÄúBack‚Äù and another ‚ÄúHome‚Äù on the screen are at your service.  This time they are not sensory, but this is one of those steps that just made the ‚Äúbattery‚Äù smartphone easier and more compact.  For some, it will even be more convenient: the left and right keys can now always be swapped in the menu. <br><br>  But if you still want to get rid of on-screen navigation buttons, then it does not matter.  They are turned off in the menu, and then they are completely replaced by a single mechanical element under the screen.  A short touch of the sensor is ‚ÄúBack‚Äù, a long touch is ‚ÄúMenu‚Äù, the button is pressed ‚ÄúHome‚Äù.  Well, when there is a choice! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/66f/d7f/1e5/66fd7f1e58ae4e99a668a614588a2ada.jpg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#d8291e">Display</font> </h2><br>  At the heart of the display, the Lenovo P2 is not an IPS matrix, as was the case with the P1, but Super AMOLED with a resolution of Full HD.  The main bonus here is efficiency, because when black is displayed on the AMOLED panel, no current is applied to the diodes.  The difference with IPS, of course, is not dramatic, not tangible.  Especially when the smartphone is used in the "Emergency mode", which will be discussed below. <br><br>  Other bonuses are also quite predictable: excellent contrast, maximum viewing angles and rich colors, which, however, do not like everyone.  Therefore, in the settings there is a second color profile with more restrained shades. <br><br>  Taking into account the 5.5-inch diagonal pixel density is 401 dpi.  Since the resolution is 1920x1080 here, not 2560x1440, then if you study closely, you can see the effect of PenTile.  However, do you often bring the smartphone to the face closer than 10-15 centimeters? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/41c/30d/940/41c30d94031a4fcebd74fc60343ef120.jpg"><br><br>  The front panel of the Lenovo P2 is covered with a protective glass Corning Gorilla Glass 3, and it has a 2.5D effect - that is, with a slight rounding around the perimeter.  It's amazing how much nicer such a trifle makes absolutely any smartphone. <br><br>  We will not play the partisans, and honestly admit that there are black frames around the display, but they are only noticeable in the Lenovo P2 golden-cream color.  If this feature is not to your liking, then we advise you to pay attention to the dark gray version with a black front panel. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#d8291e">Performance</font> </h2><br>  Lenovo P2 is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 chip. It is manufactured using a 14-nm process technology and includes eight Cortex-A53 cores with a frequency of 2 GHz and an Adreno 506 graphics accelerator. The RAM is 4 GB. <br><br>  In the benchmark AnTutu benchmarking overall smartphone performance, the device scored 63,000 points.  In the GeekBench processor test, we got 850 points in a single core and almost 3000 points in a multi core test.  The test of the graphics subsystem 3D Mark Sling Shot gave a result of 460 points. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/056/a2f/34c/056a2f34cf544f418b8e452e1fd1280d.jpg"><br><br>  However, these are all mean numbers.  What in practice?  But in practice, in general, a non-gaming smartphone easily handles projects such as Asphalt Xtreme and Modern Combat Online.  Even the mobile version of World of Tanks is absolutely playable without any ‚Äúbuts‚Äù. <br><br>  The internal memory in the Lenovo P2 is exactly 32 GB.  The memory card can be installed in one of the SIM slots in the dual tray.  Yes, we also remember that in addition to the support of two SIMs in P1 there was a separate slot for microSD and together with you we regret about this loss.  "Out of the box" on the smartphone is pre-installed Android OS 6.0.1 with the Vibe UI shell. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#d8291e">Camera</font> </h2><br>  The resolution of the main camera Lenovo P2 is 13 MP, and it is very easy and comfortable to photograph on it during the day.  You get sharp shots with good detail and nice colors.  The viewing angle of the lens is wide enough, which is useful when shooting landscapes and urban scenes. <br><br>  In addition to the automatic there is a separate professional mode in which the photographer gets quick access to adjusting the ISO, shutter speed, white balance and exposure.  It is useful to switch to it at night or with difficult lighting - so the potential of the camera can be fully revealed. <br><table><tbody><tr><th> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/efd/56e/04d/efd56e04dba340e2bba39bd772985e02.jpg" alt="image" width="310"></a> </th><th> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/534/46d/b4c/53446db4cb0741259fe53af1fffcd9b2.jpg" alt="image" width="310"></a> </th><th> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bda/fed/0a1/bdafed0a169a49babc9b69485674f0f2.jpg" alt="image" width="310"></a> </th></tr><tr><th> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2db/8d8/0cb/2db8d80cb4724e839d27815458134502.jpg" alt="image" width="310"></a> </th><th> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cf0/413/c35/cf0413c359b74a99bc86a067073d5fcf.jpg" alt="image" width="310"></a> </th><th> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/837/20e/1e5/83720e1e5d404ddb989f6d78d72e1bf1.jpg" alt="image" width="310"></a> </th></tr></tbody></table><br>  The main drawback is, of course, the lack of optical stabilization, but in smartphones of this price category it is encountered not only rarely, but extremely rarely, and for financial reasons.  When shooting at dusk or indoors, this feature should certainly be taken into account and keep P2 in your hands as safely as possible. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#d8291e">Communication and sound</font> </h2><br>  All current LTE frequency ranges for Russia (7, 20, 38 and not only) Lenovo P2 from official supplies, of course, support.  We didn‚Äôt reveal any problems during the trials in Moscow with either the connection or the GPS reception.  With the volume of the speaker and the sensitivity of the microphone everything is in order. <br><br>  The main speaker in the smartphone is one, but loud and sonorous, frightening distortion at the maximum does not occur.  There are no special solutions for listening to music in headphones: it is unlikely that the sound will surprise you, but it will not upset you - that's for sure. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/64f/298/d8e/64f298d8e8db4a4a9bc735486767440c.jpg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#d8291e">Working hours</font> </h2><br>  Lenovo P2 is one of those few smartphones whose full charge lasts for 2-3 days with a rather intensive use of all basic functions.  Of course, everyone has their own script, but no matter how hard we tried, earlier than by the evening of the second day in mixed mode it was not possible to defuse it. <br><br>  Very revealing and results in two popular scenarios.  If you force P2 to continuously turn Full HD video at maximum brightness, the phone will be able to do it for 16-20 hours in a row!  As you understand, everything depends strongly on the number of dark scenes in the video.  Non-stop marathon in games undemanding to the graphics subsystem can last 8-10 hours in a row, and this is also at maximum brightness. <br><br>  Perfectly proven in Lenovo P1 power saving mode is not gone anywhere.  To activate it quickly this time even has a special lever on the left side of the smartphone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/35b/7d5/15d/35b7d515d5a94530ac2236f419e724a4.jpg"><br><br>  The essence of the mode is that almost the entire field of the screen is filled with black color, and most of the functions of the smartphone becomes inaccessible.  All that remains is the ability to make calls, write and read SMS, access the address book, alarm clock, calendar, calculator and FM radio.  A good help if there is only 10-15% of the charge left, and the nearest approach to the outlet is not foreseen at all soon. <br><br>  Fast charging is there, but we can‚Äôt share with you the exact information about the time it takes for the smartphone to charge from 0 to 100%.  The fact is that all the test samples came to the Moscow office without branded adapters.  As soon as we receive them, we will definitely take measurements and update the information right in this paragraph. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2a3/b2a/ab1/2a3b2aab12ec4aa783c50c04d31edca9.jpg"><br><br>  The ability to charge other devices from a smartphone via an OTG cable, by the way, has not disappeared anywhere. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#d8291e">How much and where to buy?</font> </h2><br>  The announcement of Lenovo P2 in Russia took place on November 24, and the gadget will go on sale on December 7.  Starting from this date, the device with free shipping can be ordered exclusively in the company's online store <a href="https://shop.lenovo.ru/">shop.lenovo.ru</a> .  For the first 300 lucky people, the price will be 19,990 rubles, for those who are late on the first day of sales there will be a special price of 20,990 rubles.  Already on December 8, the price will return to its usual value - 23 990 rubles.  It makes sense to prepare in advance. <br><br>  Little spoiler: the first installments of the <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/lenovo/blog/268550/">P1</a> last year immediately after the release were bought up very quickly.  If you have a long time in absolute priority, then you have one of the best options in the class of ‚Äúlong-playing‚Äù smartphones.  At the same time, there are no special restrictions on the other parameters - Lenovo P2 is equipped with a decent screen, copes with mobile games and takes good pictures. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8d8/0f9/f5b/8d80f9f5bfe841c0b87ed2a79dd27452.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/399521/">https://habr.com/ru/post/399521/</a></p>
