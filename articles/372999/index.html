In addition, it is well known that almost all space objects are sources of electromagnetic waves (X-rays, gamma radiation, visible light, infrared radiation, ultraviolet radiation, radio waves).  Frequently, the frequencies of waves generated by celestial bodies are within the limits of the audible spectrum. <br><br>  Unfortunately, our ears cannot perceive electromagnetic waves, but if we convert them into <a href="http://www.pult.ru/">sound</a> , we will hear something unusual, sometimes scary, and in my subjective opinion, fascinating.  These sounds were called the music of planets, stars, black holes by the light hand of journalists.  Most of them are evidence of phenomena of the galactic and universal scale. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/64d/04a/f0b/64d04af0b27a4876a899df501dd311f8.jpg">

      The "singing" of stars and planets takes a wide variety of forms: from multi-frequency noise to original rhythmic compositions.  All this is very close to analog electronic music, for example, the experimental compositions of the group Bad Sector.  Some "voices" of celestial bodies, for example, Jupiter, very much reminded me of the sounds of the ANS synthesizer, which was actively used by Artemyev and Schnittke.  In this post I will describe the sounds that most impressed me around us, not at all in a silent universe, and will tell you something about how they appeared and how they were discovered. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  "Organ" the roar of the young universe </h3><br>  The first <a href="http://www.pult.ru/">sound of</a> our universe is considered to be the so-called sound afterglow of the big bang.  These are waves that have reached us in 13 billion years.  380,000 years after the big bang, a glow of gases appeared, discovered in the 60s of the last century and called ‚Äúcosmic microwave background radiation‚Äù (CMFI) or ‚Äúrelic radiation‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ce2/45d/400/ce245d400e574b6681a07fb0cb5f0e64.jpg"><br><br>  According to Dr. Astronomy, Professor Mark Whittle (Mark Whittle) from the University of Virginia, the CMBI map, reflecting the state of the universe in its infancy, is "an imprint of the original cry of the newborn cosmos."  As the scientist emphasizes, changes in color on a satellite map of the glow indicate a change in temperature, and these in turn indicate a change in density and pressure in a cloud of gases.  The pressure waves are essentially sound waves. <br><br>  Astronomers compare KMFI with a space organ in which colossal streams of gases and energy moved along ‚Äúpipes‚Äù of black matter. <br><br>  Reached to us, these waves sound like this: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qvjzL2UZ9pk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h3>  Space metronomes and drum`n`base </h3><br>  One of the most interesting cosmic phenomena are the sounds of pulsars, which can be compared with metronomes and drum machines.  According to the concepts accepted in astrophysics and astronomy, pulsars are rotating neutron stars that are formed after the explosion of massive stars.  Pulsars have a magnetic field inclined to the axis of their rotation.  Due to this feature, the radiation coming to earth is modulated.  From the poles of the pulsar emanates 2 radiation fluxes.  The rhythm frequency created by these flows depends on the speed of rotation. <br>  As examples, I give the rhythms of the pulsars of the Milky Way: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gb0P6x_xDEU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h3>  The roar of the solar bell </h3><br>  The sounds of our Sun hardly correspond to the ideas of earthly inhabitants about the ‚Äúwarm, kind‚Äù sun.  Low-frequency rumble, roaring, gurgling and buzzing "improvisations" of the star appear as a result of the convection process, when gases rise and fall on the surface of the star, thus creating pressure waves. <br>  According to Alex Filippenko, an astronomer from the University of California, our Sun creates 10 million tones at a time.  The number of tones of the solar "symphony" is detected by solar satellites (STEREO, SOHO, etc.), which measure the number of bumps from the pressure waves on the star's surface. <br>  Sounds of the Sun Recorded by NASA: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZZQcLJjpdrI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GvMbUxqGuOc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h3>  "Singing" solar storms </h3><br>  No less interesting phenomenon, in my opinion, are magnetic (solar) storms.  <a href="http://www.pult.ru/">The sound</a> converted and recorded during these phenomena is not uniform.  Powerful flows of mega-ionized plasma particles generate waves (sounds) that are not typical for other phenomena, which are recorded by solar satellites. <br>  As an example of such a phenomenon, we can cite a storm that hit the planets of the solar system in March 2012: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JZFbdm6EVac" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h3>  Jupiter's blood-chilling choir </h3><br>  As a result of the influence of the solar wind, inside Jupiter‚Äôs magnetic field, waves are generated, which were first recorded by NASA‚Äôs Voyager-1, which reached Jupiter on March 5, 1979. <br>  Similar sounds were recorded this year by the Juno 4, which on July 3, 2016 entered the magnetic field of the largest planet in the solar system. <br><br>  Many of those who are confronted with the sounds of this planet, say that they are afraid of them.  As I noted at the beginning of the article, the unusual sounds of Jupiter reminded me of the sound of the Soviet analog synthesizer ANS and fragments of some of Schnittke's works written on it. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8CT_txWEo5I" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oWTC7P1Dprw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h3>  Ecumenical record "subwoofer" black hole in the galaxy Perseus A </h3><br>  At a distance of 250 million light years from Earth, there is a cluster of several thousand galaxies, called the Perseus Cluster.  In the center of the cluster is the Perseus A galaxy with a huge black hole, which is an active galactic nucleus.  The galactic nucleus periodically ejects a colossal amount of energy into the surrounding space.  Such energy ‚Äúimpulses‚Äù of a black hole are essentially pressure waves. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7b8/9f8/3f9/7b89f83f9d71421084fb98d4320329dd.jpg"><br><br>  The waves of Perseus were detected by the Chandra space telescope, which detected X-rays and was able to determine its source in 2003.  In fact, if we try to reproduce a note that corresponds to the frequency of the Perseus waves, we will not hear it, since it is far beyond our perception.  The frequency at which the note sounds is one oscillation of 10 million years.  According to calculations by scientists from NASA and the American Planetary Society, this note is 57 octaves lower than the ‚ÄúC‚Äù note of the first piano octave, i.e.  a billion times lower than the frequency that a person is able to perceive.  Perseus Subwoofer makes the lowest sound in the universe of all known to man. <br><br>  I believe that those who are interested in the sounds of the cosmos will find these links useful: <br><br>  ¬ª <a href="https://soundcloud.com/nasa">Soundcloud.com/nasa</a> <br>  ¬ª <a href="http://www.spacesounds.com/">Spacesounds.com</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/372999/">https://habr.com/ru/post/372999/</a></p>
