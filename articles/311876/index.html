It has proven itself in forensic science of the 20th century and has helped to reveal not one hundred crimes.  However, technology does not stand still, and fingerprints are no longer the only ‚Äúkey‚Äù to identification. <br><br>  Modern technology has learned to recognize users by the retina and iris of the eye, the shape of the face and hands, and a number of dynamic characteristics - voice, biological activity of the heart, handwriting and keyboard writing. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Iris Identification </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/936/4f8/ffe/9364f8ffeefe4fb8a7154619ff09f50a.png">

      Like a fingerprint, the iris pattern is a unique characteristic of a person, and the method of identification according to this biometric parameter, according <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/126144/">to</a> experts, exceeds the usual fingerprinting in reliability.  In order to fix the pattern on the iris, you need a camera with high resolution.  The resulting image is enlarged and converted into a unique code assigned to a person. <br><br>  The drawing of the iris, which is finally formed in the second year of a child‚Äôs life, remains almost unchanged during life if the person does not receive injuries and does not suffer from serious ophthalmic pathologies.  At the same time, the papillary pattern of the fingerprint is subject to change even as a result of minor household injuries - burns or cuts, which makes this method of identification less effective than the analysis of the iris. <br><br>  The advantage of the method is the simplicity in scanning.  It is not necessary for a person to look intently at one point, because spots on the retina are located directly on the surface of the eyeball and are easily read at a distance not exceeding 1 meter.  It is convenient to use this method in banking organizations or public transport.  Smartphone manufacturers were also <a href="http://www.macdigger.ru/iphone-ipod/samsung-vnedrit-v-smartfony-texnologiyu-identifikacii-po-raduzhnoj-obolochke-glaza.html">interested in</a> technology - in 2015, the first model with an iris scanner, the Fujitsu Arrows NX F-04G, <a href="https://hi-tech.mail.ru/news/fujitsu-first-iris-scaner-smartphone/">went</a> on sale in Japan.  According to the developers, the introduction of identification technology on the iris will help protect the personal data of smartphone owners. <br><br><h3>  Retina Identification </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/64d/ca3/43e/64dca343e1664d3385f6e52aefa16ac2.png"><br><br>  Scanning the retina - the inner shell of the eyeball, which reacts to light, is more difficult: for this, low-intensity infrared light rays are sent to the blood vessels of the back wall of the eye through the pupil.  This method of identification is considered highly effective and is widely used in government and military facilities. <br><br>  Capillary pattern of the retina differs even in twins, which reduces the likelihood of identification errors.  However, in 2012, scientists from the University of Notre Dame in the United States found errors in determining the personalities of people whose data were entered into the database before 2008, and proved that, unlike the pattern on the iris, the retinal pattern is subject to a number of age changes. <br><br>  And again, manufacturers of mobile gadgets did not stand aside.  A number of companies ( <a href="http://myzte.ru/company/press/news/Identifikatsiya-po-setchatke-glaza/">for example</a> , the Chinese ZTE CORPORATION) are working on the creation of combined identification technologies on the retina and iris. <br><br><h3>  Face Recognition by ‚ÄúGeometry‚Äù </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/07b/36c/736/07b36c7360f84c45806a1b4bb16f6f82.png"><br><br>  The method of identifying individuals according to traits seems to experts one of the most <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/126144/">promising</a> , largely due to their ‚Äúfamiliarity‚Äù: people easily identify each other by their individuals, so why not teach this computer?  The technology is based on the creation of two-dimensional or three-dimensional "maps" of human features - the system remembers and identifies the contours of the nose and lips, the shape of the eyebrows, the distance between the individual features. <br><br>  The developers of biometric analysis systems of the domestic company BioLink <a href="http://www.biolink.ru/technology/facial.php">call</a> face recognition the second most common and popular biometric technology.  However, ‚Äúidentification‚Äù by face geometry is a laborious task, because the perception of the machine is affected by the lighting, the angle of the head, the presence of makeup. <br><br>  The most effective technique recognizes static images - photos.  Thus, the FaceNet artificial intelligence system created by Google ‚Äú <a href="https://xakep.ru/2015/03/20/google-facenet/">identified</a> ‚Äù 99.63% of the photos of Internet users. <br><br><h3>  Recognition of the biological activity of the heart </h3><br>  One of the newest technologies of dynamic biometric identification is identification on the basis of data on the work of the cardiovascular system. <br><br>  In 2014, the Canadian company Bionym <a href="http://www.cnews.ru/news/top/kanadtsy_predstavili_tehnologiyu_identifikatsii">introduced to the</a> world a device that allows the use of a human ECG as a personal identifier.  "In the scientific community, there is a well-established idea that the uniqueness and constancy of the human heart rhythm makes it possible to use it as a biometric identifier," said Bionym CEO Karl Martin.  ‚ÄúIn essence, you need to do the following: take an ECG form and subject it to computer analysis to reveal unique and permanent features.‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/85c/a8c/ba7/85ca8cba7db74ee59b2d08cb727e5058.png"><br><br>  High efficiency technology noted by domestic security experts.  ‚ÄúA cardiogram, as it turns out, can also be quite a promising means of biometric authentication,‚Äù said Kaspersky Lab experts. <br><br>  Similar developments are already underway in Russia.  For example, representatives of the domestic company <a href="http://cardioqvark.ru/">CardioQVARK</a> (they already had articles on <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/277287/">Habr√©</a> and <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/270566/">Hyktayms</a> ), producing cardiac monitor cases for the iPhone, in the ‚Äú <a href="http://cardioqvark.ru/science/identification.html">Study of artificial neural networks in the task of identification by electrocardiogram</a> ‚Äù showed that their product can help in identifying users . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/825/bb6/73b/825bb673b7824eadb26f20d49d14ec78.png"><br><br>  The main purpose of the device is remote control over the state of health of core patients, however, the ability to make a rapid analysis of the state of the cardiovascular system will allow identifying a person without time-consuming.  The procedure for removing the ECG using the CardioQVARK case is extremely simple and takes only a few seconds: just put your fingers on the sensors and the result of the ECG will appear on the screen of the gadget and in the application for the doctor. <br><br><h3>  Voice analysis </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/614/cc1/fed/614cc1fedd5f411c98271c77f4651fb4.png"><br><br>  The biometric method of voice identification is easy to use - it is enough to equip the analytical device with a microphone and record the ‚Äúsound‚Äù of a particular person.  The wide distribution of this method is due to the presence of a microphone and the ability to record sound on most modern mobile gadgets and computers.  However, the technology has a number of significant flaws: the voice of the same person may sound differently depending on his psychological and physical condition, noise level, microphone quality. <br><br><h3>  Not only security </h3><br>  Contrary to popular belief, biometric identification systems are being introduced not only to ensure the security of protected objects or to counteract crime.  For example, a number of identification systems are used in educational institutions.  Some modern schools introduce students 'iris scans to control attendance and even to simplify the procedure for paying school lunches and lunches - the child comes to the canteen, his retina is scanned, a certain amount is charged from the parents' account for feeding the offspring.  Fingerprint <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/054025_biometrics_fingerprinting_school_cafeterias.html">scanning</a> systems are also used.  In the production of such systems allow you to mark the time spent by the employee in the workplace. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/311876/">https://habr.com/ru/post/311876/</a></p>
