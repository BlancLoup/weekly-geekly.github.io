Very beautiful, slim and logical.  Almost like communism. <br><br>  Libertarianism declares that above all - the inviolability of personal freedom and private property, and that any violence is unacceptable - including state violence.  The interaction between people is carried out through voluntary transactions, and their strict voluntariness is a guarantee that no one will be offended.  There is a beautiful flash drive on this subject here - I highly recommend it, it‚Äôs impressive. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      Alas, in practice, everything is not so good.  Only a hundred years things were quite libertarian - and as a result, the worker could conclude a completely voluntary deal with the factory owner for a penny 14 hours a day (or just not voluntarily enter into it and die of hunger) to sell the remains of their land buyers-up (voluntarily kick in when the money runs out), and the cafe owner could completely free not to let the Negro (Chinese, Irish, etc) in their restaurant - and also would have been in his right, patamuchta private property  ness <br><br>  Then times have changed.  Labor movement, strikes, unrest, in some places - a revolution.  Later, but from the same series - gender equality, the fight against racism, human rights, tolerance, political correctness.  Laws of labor appeared in one form or another - yes, government intervention and violation of freedoms, but there are no revolutions.  By 70m, almost all European countries (and, to a lesser extent, the USA) were quite social states - the worker worked little (8 hours against 14), received decent work, and it was difficult to fire him.  It is, in principle, and so now. <br><br>  But then the workers in Europe.  And we are not working in Europe; we are IT workers in the CIS.  And then everything is different. <br><br>  For a number of socio-economic reasons, labor laws do not work here.  The line ‚Äúwhite salary, the Labor code‚Äù is increasingly found in job descriptions - but for the time being it is no more than one of the bonuses, and everyone decides for himself whether he needs this bonus.  The eight-hour working day, the inability to just dismiss, the right to strike ... Well, you understand :) <br><br>  But. <br><br>  The fact is that the worker of the 19th century and IT of the 21st are distinguished by one important detail: IT is valuable.  Hiring a person is difficult; replacing is even more difficult; the road is fraught with downtime.  And therefore, the employer also does not want to lose a person, as a person - an employer. <br><br>  And the Labor Code, as a result, is not needed. <br><br>  Avraly, recycling?  OK, but for a lot of money.  No white salary?  But a comfortable office and a pleasant atmosphere.  Are you fired?  SSZB, and I will find another job.  Reluctant to work for a salary?  Wellcome to freelance. <br><br>  The triumph of free and unlimited transactions between free people, in general. <br><br>  So, what I am all about. <br><br>  IT gave the world several examples of successful building of a communist society (open source, wikipedia) - everyone has already noticed this. <br>  But what he gave an excellent example of a working libertarian society ‚Äî for some reason, they say it less often. <br><br>  And in vain, by the way.  :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/16552/">https://habr.com/ru/post/16552/</a></p>
