I really want to talk about what I have been doing for the last three days, namely, the opposition to the support of the masterhost.  Since 2006, I have been using a masterhost, mainly because they had sane support, the intervention of which was often not needed.  Either the engineers did everything themselves.  Now, apparently the situation has changed. <br><br>  Three days (!), Already three whole days, they cannot start my domain and register a vhost :) <br><br>  <b>upd:</b> Three more (!) letters from the domain owner and the problem is solved, everything works!  And it seems to me not without the help of Habr.  :) <br>  <b>upd2: The masterhost</b> sent an apology letter, the incident was settled.

      And now in order: <br>  On the morning of this Sunday, the transfer of our modest project to a second-level domain was assigned to a site that was previously used by the same project, but only as a file storage.  The result is deplorable and from this situation I see two exits, one of which is moving to another hosting provider.  Not for the sake of advertising, I really want to know your preferences. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><ol><li>  The support engineer confirmed that everything is in order in the DNS zone.  This was not true, because I did not create (in the control panel) a new domain, svalko.org.  The engineer‚Äôs explanation was this: dns replication takes up to 72 hours.  When the old ip from the dns record disappeared in the world and all the alias became available, my suspicions that it was not a matter of DNS replication received confirmation. </li><li>  After the domain was created, all operations on it returned an error that no DNS zone is associated with it. </li><li>  DNS really began to be updated only after I made a change in the editor, records began to appear on ns1.  I wrote in all letters that I requested DNS from ns.masterhost.ru directly, and that replication has nothing to do with it. <br><br>  So the first two days passed - weekends - the best time to move is already lost.  :( </li><li>  I deleted data.oldyy.domain.ru not to put redirects, but simply to give content from all addresses from one site.  It was a fatal mistake.  It was impossible to create a synonym (vhost) for the host, because the owner also uses the masterhost.  It so happened that he is on vacation in places where the Internet - GPRS in roaming, p.5.  However, this did not prevent me from using this domain for four kopecks of the year. </li><li>  The owner of the old domain.domain.ru went online, who put the old domain.domain.ru CNAME on a new domain, but did not suspect that this would be another fatal error.  Since there is no vhost, the masterhost issues a stub with a caliper phone. </li></ol><br><br>  The result of all this is the old site is new, earned in three days, and I already want to move to a more sane site (and cheaper, because as it turned out at the masterhost, the prices are higher than the market);  and also, because the masterhost support engineers seriously think that I decided to steal 3rd and 4th level domains from myself using vhost and faking the FROM fields from an e-mail address.  And this is despite the fact that the domain owner has already registered a CNAME for my new domain.  :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/86100/">https://habr.com/ru/post/86100/</a></p>
