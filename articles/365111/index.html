Quite often, it ends with the use of obscene language and the purchase of a new device. <br>  However, sometimes, as in my case, the matter is in such trivial details that we simply do not attach importance to them. <br>  For those who don‚Äôt want to spend time on lyrical digressions, I just suggest checking if you have fulfilled three simple conditions, others can read my history of home network ‚Äúrepair‚Äù under the cut. <br><br><h5><ul><li>  Keep your router away from a source of powerful impulse noise, which can be, for example, a closely located opened working computer or an uninterruptible power supply. </li><li>  Raise your router by a meter and a half from the floor, even if it at the same time spoils the interior.  Try to play with the orientation of the antennas, and also make sure that close to them are not able to shield the signal metal surfaces. </li><li>  Try to power the router from a bespereboynik or, in extreme cases, through a good surge protector.  This will greatly reduce the likelihood of its forced reboots and freezes. </li></ul></h5><br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      A month after moving to a new apartment, I started receiving complaints from my wife about the work of our home Wi-Fi network.  Every day they grew stronger and eventually turned into a scandal.  It was no longer possible to postpone and had to postpone all matters to correct the situation. <br>  It should be noted that I have laid a cable to my office, but besides that we have a large number of endpoints, which either cannot be connected using a cable, like smartphones, or it is very inconvenient - a pair of laptops and a monoblock.  Until last year, we used an old ASUS and it was poorly performing its functions, but its wireless module slowly degraded, the number of connected points in our network grew rapidly, but the number of networks at our neighbors, which also did not improve the quality of communication, increased even faster. <br>  As a result, we purchased a zixel with a more powerful transmitter and two antennas.  To prevent unauthorized access to the wireless network from home-grown hackers, I set up a white list of devices that have the right to connect to the network.  After taking action, life has become much more fun. <br>  Less than half a year later, a new problem appeared with the move.  At first, the connection speed dropped significantly, then the network began to work with jerks, and the pauses between sessions, especially in the evenings, became longer and longer.  Using my super magic button to reset the router seemed to help, but not for long. <br>  To buy a new, even more powerful miracle of technology on the price tag that increased over the last year twice, we did not smile too much and I decided to try to rectify the situation on my own. <br><br>  For a start, I tried to conjure with the settings - set the maximum priority for WiFi connection.  Did not help.  After some thought, I scanned the signal level of the available networks and found the least loaded frequency channel to which I had a hard set up network operation.  Again, close to zero effect.  The ideas dried up on this, and if the quality of work has improved very little.  It was clear that it was time to take decisive measures - to make an inspection in the room of the son - teenager, in which the router was installed. <br>  As a result, it turned out the following - for the month that had passed since the initial installation, the router from the computer case (located under the table) migrated to the case of the bespereboynik, which stood next to the system unit on the floor.  The side cover of the computer that was looking at the router was dismantled, and the remaining metal parts of the computer case shielded the signal propagation in the direction of our room.  I didn‚Äôt like this picture very much and despite the fact that I didn‚Äôt really believe in success, I decided to try the last resort. <br>  Having unraveled a coil of wires, he moved the router to the top shelf of the computer desk ‚Äî about a meter and a half above the floor.  Turned on its power in a bespereboynik and oriented the antenna to a position close to the vertical.  It's unbelievable, but a miracle happened.  The signal quality has increased significantly, but the most important fades have disappeared and the network has been working almost perfectly for the second week already. <br><br>  <i>I hope that if you are faced with a similar situation, then my advice will be useful for you.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/365111/">https://habr.com/ru/post/365111/</a></p>
