How to earn $ 1000 on one title</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/213/a40/fe7/213a40fe70c1f20d62081006cd2475d4.jpg" alt="image"><br>  By the XXII Winter Olympics, I released a toy <i>Biathlon 2014</i> for <i>iOS</i> . <br>  With the release of the application, I tried to protect the thesis <blockquote>  Earn on a mobile game without investing money in advertising, you can only speculating with the name of the application </blockquote><br><h4>  Short description </h4><br>  In this game, the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/213019/">method of combining</a> virtual objects (targets) with the surrounding reality is used.  The stage of running from the shooting range to the shooting range made in the style of flappy bird.  Competitions are between the host device and the 12th best to date riders in the world: <i>Fourcade, Shipulin, Swensen, Moravec, Bjurindaline</i> and others. <br><br><h4>  A warning </h4><br>  The application is paid.  Successful programmers can afford <s>30</s> 35 (inflation) rubles for the purchase, if they wish.  Students and oligarchs can use <i>habr-dialogue</i> - I will gladly send you a promo code for a free download.  Promo codes left <i>29 pieces</i> . <br><br>  Below is the story, as I released this application and interim financial indicators.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Development </h4><br>  I spent <i>15,000</i> rubles to develop the application. <br>  <i>10 000</i> rubles went to the artist <i>Andrei Chesnokov.</i>  He worked 2 days. <br>  <i>5 000</i> rubles went to the programmer.  He worked 1 day. <br>  The code of last year's application <i>Biathlon 2013</i> became the basis for the simulator of shooting in <a href="http:">Biathlon 2014</a> .  Virtually nothing new programming was required. <br><br>  Stage skiing in doubt.  How to emulate a run? <br>  I tried dozens of options.  The process of pushing away with sticks can be imitated by different events.  <i>Tap</i> on the screen.  Exhale  Shaking.  Scream.  Blinking eyes.  Slap the mouth.  Waving hands.  Jogging with the <i>iPhone</i> around the office. <br><br>  I tried everything.  My jaw hurts.  Hands were heavy.  The rib is broken.  Eyes - watery.  iPhone - shattered. <br>  Do you know what is the most effective way to control the mouth by pronouncing the word <i><b>AM</b></i> ? <br>  The words <b><i>YES, OCP, RUN, ONCE, FUCK, JUMP, AP</i></b> are much worse and slower. <br><br>  As a result of research, I came to the conclusion that hands and fingers are our everything.  The monkey took a stick in the <b>hands</b> and became a man.  And the fulcrum is needed, <i>Archimedes</i> was thrice right.  Therefore, I smile ironically, reading about the management of the future through <i>leap motion</i> , pupils and other <i>kinekty</i> . <br>  In short, the control made a <i>tap</i> on the screen in <i>flappy bird</i> style, in a potential field of gravity. <blockquote>  Acceleration for iPhone <b><i>6000 pixels</i></b> per second squared.  The vertical speed of a skier with a tap is <b><i>300 pixels</i></b> per second. </blockquote>  These settings correlate well with the settings of the scandalous <i>flappy bird</i> game. <br><br><h4>  Apple Store </h4><br>  I missed the start of the Olympics.  The application was made, tested only on Friday February 7th.  On the opening day.  Need to do something.  I used a special request form on the <i>Apple</i> website, where I begged to check the application quickly.  Not in 7-10 days, as they do, but in 24 hours.  On <i>Habr√©</i> someone told me about this opportunity.  I sent the request at 15-00.  And already at 15-26 on my server (and I am following <i>Apple</i> ), I discovered the launch of the application by the user <i>shop002-04</i> from <i>Cupertino</i> .  Wow!  Respect ... They work at night?  The answer from <i>Apple</i> came quickly - <blockquote>  Dear developer, your letter is very important for us, but we are busy.  So, walk Vasya. </blockquote><br>  What are they doing ?? who is Vasya?  Well Vadim, in a pinch, Dima.  Okay. <br>  After 8 (disgusting, gentlemen) days, the answer came from the review team <br><blockquote>  Your shooting is too realistic.  Change the flag in the Realistic Violence field from None to Frequent / Intense. </blockquote><br>  Hell, thank God, the application does not need to be recompiled and re-laid out - there would be another week of delay and goodbye to the Olympics !!! <br>  Quickly did as they ordered - as a result, the scoreboard caught fire The <s>toilet is busy</s> .  Or rather, <blockquote>  This app will be sold in the following territories: Brazil, Korea </blockquote><br>  It seems with the ZOI in Korea 2018 I fly. <br>  The application is approved the next day.  Whew! <br><br><h4>  Loshara i loshare mi cantara </h4><br>  Immediately, after approval, I ran to the <i>Appstore</i> to buy the app and leave a positive review.  I type <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bathlon-2014/id768661889%3Fls%3D1%26mt%3D8">Biathlon 2014</a> - there is nothing. <br>  What?  Oh my God!  When registering at the app store, I missed the letter <i>i</i> in the title.  <i>Bathlon 2014</i> .  There was no limit to my frustration.  The name can be changed in the only way.  The release of the next version - and this is again 9 days of waiting!  Sad, I went to bed.  I slept for a long time.  Dreamed apples in the snow.  Awoke.  Entered the game server.  Ahahahaha! <br>  40 people bought!  40!  Germans, Norwegians, Franks and Pasta !!!  Russian - 10 people, appeared in the list of participants after yesterday's publication of an article on Habr√©. <br><br><h4>  Reports and money </h4><br>  Every day there is a Cup among iOS racers.  They still do not know about it.  And I will reveal to you a secret - <a href="http://www.bashni.org/sites/iphone/biathlon/biathlon_news.php">here is the current standing</a> .  I hope you will enter the top 10 of tomorrow's best race. <br>  Now the application is bought on average 1 time in 1 hour. <br>  Judging by the downloads by the end of February and <i>the World Cup 2014, the</i> application will earn $ 1,000.  In a month, if you're interested, I will post a report.  Unfortunately, <a href="https://itunesconnect.apple.com/">itunesconnect.apple.com</a> three days ago released a new version of its site - and as a result of the magnificent work of the magnificent Indians, it is impossible to look at the reports.  <i>Safari</i> hangs tightly on all devices, and on the <i>iPad</i> crashes after 3-4 minutes of total hang. <br><br>  And these people check our apps !! ??? <br><br>  However, Thank you for your attention. <br><br>  Yes, I forgot.  There is a video.  A bit boring, so hidden in the final of the article. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Two minute video bunny game</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/QVDEewAy6Yc%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhguCgL0GuhK_IE_3j3-7oNDh2bmTA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br></div></div></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/213317/">https://habr.com/ru/post/213317/</a></p>
