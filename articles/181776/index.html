  <section class="page js-page"><h1>ERP implementation: how not to turn Enterprise Resource Planning into an Expensive Reasonless Program</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In recent years, large companies unanimously and actively implement various ERP systems - who for the image, whom the external consultants made, and who really realizes that this is a necessary and useful thing.  However, the latter, unfortunately, is extremely small.  At 3 places of work, I happened to see and touch 3 completely different ERP systems, which is especially surprising given the fact that most of my friends do not even know what it is.  But since such software is tightly embedded in the lives of workers in our Slavic spaces, I would like to share my experience and help prevent typical mistakes that can even lead to the militia of all company employees on a system in which considerable financial and time resources are already invested. <br><br>  So, about each object I studied separately. <br><a name="habracut"></a>  <b>1. OpenERP at N. Company.</b> The system itself is a great product, with a friendly interface and great features.  Company N is a Ukrainian company with points of sale in several CIS countries, a claim to internationality and low-grade Chinese goods, decided to implement OpenERP independently, on its own.  Why pay these ERP developers, who do nothing but rob honest Ukrainian companies, what can they understand with their many years of experience?  And they understand that any such project begins with planning - the goal and stages are determined, the key business processes are first on paper, and only then in the system.  N company management decided to ignore this fact and follow the principle ‚Äúnormal heroes always go around‚Äù, therefore from the very beginning of implementation in 2011, to this day, the project has not been completed.  New modules are added spontaneously: which department has more zadolbal leadership, in order and TK implement.  Tellingly, the department that deals with the implementation consists of very intelligent guys - the implementation of the TZ has always been almost perfect (and I had to act as a customer, so I know what I'm talking about).  What is the problem if the product is good and the implementation is also at the level?  The problem is that the project did not have a goal at all - the management and the owners did not understand why they were introducing the product, but they were ready for implementation because they thought it was almost free.  But is it?  If the project began in 2011 and still lasts, then, obviously, it is led by some people.  We list them - project manager, administrator, 3 programmers (not counting external consultants who described business processes for 3 months, I'm afraid to even suggest how much it could cost).  Each of them received, and receives a salary to the present moment, and PYTHON programmers receive not a penny.  At the same time, the effect of their work, due to the lack of a project goal, is not clear, i.e  ERP system is created to create an ERP system.  And we do not consider this, how many processes stand idle and work inefficiently, while waiting for automation, which may never come. <br>  There are misunderstandings with the staff.  90% of employees do not understand the meaning of the introduction of the program and in every possible way put a stick in the wheel.  Most of the problems in the company are now also written off to ERP - now it‚Äôs a reason for financiers, why they don‚Äôt always have data that never met before, for sales managers, why they process so few contacts per day that they process only if they are standing over them with a baseball bat, and no software can help here. <br>  Due to strategic mistakes and the desire to save a great ERP system has become a collective corporate disaster.  Well, not clinking glasses. <br><br>  <b>2. SAP in company X.</b> Company X is a huge international company, a leader in its industry.  SAP is a corporate standard for all plants and departments of the company.  After receiving the login and password and logging in, I had a desire to call N, and explain there to everyone that if they don‚Äôt like OpenERP, then they‚Äôre just <habracut>  Yes, did not work in SAP.  The interface simply amazes with its incomprehensibility and non-usability.  Fortunately, all business processes have been implemented, and implementation has long been done, i.e.  all the functions that I needed, according to the job description, to perform, were there.  I learned about the main problem almost immediately - the performance was terribly low.  An elementary request for the procurement of a certain material for the last year was carried out for 2!  hours  It was all about saving on servers.  And the load on them was crazy, because  In the system, only in Russia, employees of 8 factories worked.  As a result - constant downtime of people and equipment, not produced in time products.  Conclusion - buying an expensive system (and you will not name SAP in another way), do not save on equipment, otherwise the money will be wasted.

      <b>3. IFS Applications in company Y.</b> The first thing I want to say is ERP with the best interface among those I have worked for.  Everything is so simple and understandable that it seems as if the layout of each button was carefully thought out.  Company Y is engaged in the development and testing of applications for mobile devices and wants to take the lead in this market, so the introduction of ERP for them was rather an image event.  The system works fine, but they use it mainly as a CRM and task setting, although you can do anything with it.  The question is - why implement a product with serious functionality just to maintain a customer base there?  This, of course, is cool when people can afford it (IFS Applications is also not a cheap system), but, having studied the ERP function, they would understand that with its help you can get a good economic effect, and not just once.  Sometimes you just want to take people and shake them so that they wake up. <br><br>  Let's sum up: <br>  1) Goals, goals and goals again.  Without their setting, you will never know whether the implementation was successful or not, and in general, whether it was completed. <br>  2) Planning.  Without the existence of a clear ERP plan, you will implement the system when people start flying. <br>  3) Learn to trust professionals.  Developers of ERP systems have long been working in the market and spend huge amounts of money on R &amp; D, so it is necessary, at least, to contact them for advice.  Own development is cool, but if the programmer who wrote the system for you at some point demobilized, no one can figure out these wilds and everything can be thrown away like garbage (I also saw this). <br>  4) Watch the system performance and increase the power of the equipment in time, otherwise a perfectly implemented and functional system will turn into trash and be anathematized by all employees of the enterprise. <br>  5) By the way, about employees - if you are only at the implementation stage, do not forget that they need to be prepared for new work standards, otherwise you will get a riot on the ship.  It is easier to calm down or get rid of a few disgruntled ones at the initial stage than to listen to the complaints of each employee. <br>  6) Remember usability - someone really will have to work with this, so the interface is very important.  A good interface can significantly reduce performer dissatisfaction. <br>  7) The system must be efficient.  ERP system is not just a program.  She can and should help you earn or save money.  This is a great tool for business development, but if you do not fully use its capabilities, you will look at the heels of competitors far ahead of yourself. <br><br>  I do not claim that my opinion is the absolute truth.  It, as well as any opinion, is subjective.  Perhaps this will help remove a rake from under the feet of some company, on which others have already attacked a great many times.  That will be enough for me. </habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/181776/">https://habr.com/ru/post/181776/</a></p>
