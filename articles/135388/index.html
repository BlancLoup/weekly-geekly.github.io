Cool! <br><br>  How many times have I heard such a dialogue.  And the meaning is about the same as "Manager."  Also such a common phrase, which by itself can mean dozens of variations.  In Russia (probably, all over the world, but I cannot vouch for it) for some reason it is considered to be the designer of everyone who can (or thinks he can) pick pictures for articles, draw buttons on websites and come up with illustrations for T-shirts (the last generally an illustrator, not a designer).  T-shirt designer ... Fu!  A T-shirt designer is one who, let's say, designs a T-shirt.  The drawing on it is an entsatoi affair.  And we do not!  We have the one who painted the emoticon and printed it on a T-shirt.  I exaggerate in places, of course, but the meaning is exactly that. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The same situation in everything else.  For example, with the site designer as well. <br>  A site designer is someone who takes content, structures it properly, designs a site for all this content (where what blocks should be, how they should work, why they should be there, and not here, etc.), prepares layouts In which the content already corresponds to the design, prepares the documentation on how to work with these layouts as follows.  All this is a designer.  I meet mostly with those who design (mostly Internet project managers who don‚Äôt understand in design), who prepare and structure the content (oddly enough, the same managers again) and the person who draws pictures for all this .  The result is such a crooked half-witted half-designer in two or three faces.  We don‚Äôt usually take any documentation for developers.  Nobody even asks for her.  They are asked to give mockups and all.  Further do not care how it will be implemented.

      Now in Russia more and more art directors have started to appear, who have somehow begun to put in order the porridge they get at the exit from the "curvaceous half-witted under-designer".  Only this will not help!  We must start from the bottom, from the designer.  It is necessary that he was a full-fledged, so that the manager would not bother with his own business, that the designer would love his creation from birth to graduation and not release it without proper instructions. <br><br>  Well, okay, it happens that a full-fledged designer still consists of several sub-designers.  Only such a bunch works several times longer.  It is completely ineffective in time or in the quality of the product. <br><br>  In general, the site designer - it should be a small monster, many-sidedly familiar with the process of developing the site.  And not something that is ubiquitous. <br><br><h5>  Designer </h5><br>  Never met "designer glasses" or "designer T-shirts"?  In stores it happens.  Sorry, but who did the non-design glasses?  Locksmith?  What a perverted concept of design ... Any product (even a tin can, even the core of a fountain pen) begins with a design and a designer. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/135388/">https://habr.com/ru/post/135388/</a></p>
