  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why do I sponsor crowdfunding projects?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A few years ago I read an article on a video game resource.  The article described the new game of Tim Schefer.  Sheyfer, for reference, one of the most respected igrodelov in the world.  Working in Lucasarts, he had a hand in the iconic quests of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Secret_of_Monkey_Island">The Secret of Monkey Island</a> and <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_of_the_Tentacle">Day of the Tentacle</a> , and later released <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_Throttle_(%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0,_1995)">Full Throttle</a> and <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grim_Fandango">Grim Fandango</a> .  If you are over 20, most likely you know these games.  I have not played in any of these quests, but I am still familiar with the works of Schaefer.  In 2005, <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychonauts">the Psychoneauts</a> came out, which were incredibly beautiful and gave me a few hours of happiness. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/766/52e/b87/76652eb8744c4e9f9171c652e2e06411.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  But I digress.  The article I am talking about did not tell so much about Schaefer‚Äôs new project, but about the original way of publishing the game.  Schaefer offered to everyone who wanted to be thrown off to develop the game, instead of offering various bonuses.  I had never heard anything like it before, but I thought, ‚ÄúHow cool it is!  You can send a couple of dollars, and voila!  ‚ÄúI am the publisher of the game!‚Äù  In my memory, the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/doublefine/double-fine-adventure">project Schaefer</a> was the first major game project on Kickstarter.  After Schaefer, they began to write about crowdfunding everywhere, and the world, as the King's shooter Roland would say, ‚Äúmoved.‚Äù <br><br>  <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/inxile/wasteland-2">Wasteland‚Äôs</a> developers, <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/obsidian/project-eternity">igrodels from Obsidian</a> , came after <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/obsidian/project-eternity">Schaefer</a> , and the Kickstarter game section turned into a place where classic games got a chance for a second life.  At about the same time, the ‚Äúiron fever‚Äù began on Kickstarter.  Today, the number of new gadgets and devices released using crowdfunding has hundreds (or maybe thousands) of devices.  Gadgets for every taste - from smart watches to smart luggage and appliances to help you realize yourself in a dream.  This was made possible thanks to the support of a huge community, who cares about what will happen to our world tomorrow.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/841/3c0/6df/8413c06dfaa9422288a7db276f03b925.png"><br><br>  Two and a half years ago the crowd appeared in Russia.  The circumstances were such that I was involved in this process, and during all this time I became a sponsor of fifty projects.  The first was <a href="https://boomstarter.ru/projects/134/exoplanet_%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B2%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582">Exoplanet</a> - action / rpg in the setting of a fantastic western.  The game scored 8300 rubles out of the declared 4 000 000, and, it seems, has not yet come out.  The money, as it should be, came back and I supported several more projects, none of which was successful. <br><br>  In December 2012, I became the sponsor of the project <a href="https://boomstarter.ru/projects/3270/arhidom">‚ÄúArkhid‚Äù</a> , which successfully collected the necessary amount.  And here it has begun.  This is a very cool feeling when something good happens, and it is thanks to you.  Together with me, another 74 people helped bring to light a new space in Kazan, in which children can learn new things, acquire useful skills and feel that they are needed.  Since then, I began to regularly support various projects. <br><br>  Two of the coolest are Nick Perumov <a href="https://boomstarter.ru/projects/51681/lemeh_i_borozda">'s</a> novel <a href="https://boomstarter.ru/projects/51681/lemeh_i_borozda">‚ÄúThe Plowshare and the Furrow‚Äù</a> , and the very fresh <a href="https://boomstarter.ru/projects/232262/magic_cup">Magic Cup</a> .  I supported Perumov because I read his books at school, and simply could not help my favorite writer.  Magic Cup was supported mainly because this project is one of the few gadget projects in Russian crowds.  The more such successful projects there are, the sooner the Russian crowdfunding will turn into a forge of technology that it once became in the west. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cdb/d08/29b/cdbd0829b4b449dca243747fa71fb3a9.png"><br><br>  The best thing is that it doesn‚Äôt matter how much money you send to the author.  I supported some projects with 50 rubles, some with several thousand.  Of course, the more money you send, the better the reward you will get.  But the paradox is that the reward in the end, carries with it less value than the realization that you live for a reason and good ideas are embodied thanks to you.  Maybe there is something selfish.  Nevertheless, I think everyone wants to feel that you live for the benefit of others.  Crowdfunding is not the only way to feel it, but definitely one of the easiest. <br><br>  Earlier, friends told me that crowdfunding is begging.  Many of them have changed their point of view.  More and more in crowdfunding, people see an opportunity to change the world.  It sounds pathetic and trite, but it seems to me that this is true.  Of course, the crowd is not the same (haha) that was before.  Most of the campaigns now (especially on Kickstarter and Indigougou) are not launched with the goal of getting money.  Today crowd is a marketing and public relations tool.  Companies launch their projects and test demand, receive pre-orders.  However, this does not negate the fact that crowding gave everyone the opportunity to touch the creation of something new - be it a smart mirror or the perfect breakfast knife.  These products make life easier, they bring the future closer. <br><br>  Try to become a sponsor of a project.  No matter how much money you are willing to send to the author of the project, just support an idea that you like.  Once we have the Internet, let it benefit, and not just broadcast seals. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/364023/">https://habr.com/ru/post/364023/</a></p>
