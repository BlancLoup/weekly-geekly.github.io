I was also not lazy and ordered myself <a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/HIGH-QUALITY-5200MAH-EXTENDED-BATTERY-for-AT-T-SAMSUNG-GALAXY-NOTE-i717-DOOR-GR-/180986432569%3Fpt%3DPDA_Accessories%26hash%3Ditem2a23a1cc39">this Chinese battery</a> , and also agreed with the representative of Mugen Power <a href="http://www.mugen-power-batteries.ru/samsung/samsung-galaxy-note/mugen-power-4500mah-extended-battery-for-samsung-galaxy-note-with-battery-door.html">about one more battery</a> , this time at 5400 mAh. <br>  So for a full review, I will test 4 types of batteries: a battery from Mugen Power (5400 mAh) - sample No. 1, a Chinese Noname analog (5200 mAh) - sample No. 2, a battery from Mugen Power (4500 mAh) - sample No. 3, Samsung standard battery (2500 mAh) - sample number 4. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d26/643/b8d/d26643b8dc74dbbacc4f161d7884502d.png"><br>  <i>From left to right (sample number 1, number 2, number 3 and number 4)</i> <br>  <b><u>Under the cut traffic !!!</u></b> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h3>  Delivery </h3><br>  Like last time, sample number 1 came in a pimply polyethylene with instructions and one-piece packaging.  True, this time I ordered a white cover, just for comparison, especially since the cover from sample No. 3 is also excellent for sample No. 1. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/558/d03/620/558d03620f4429ee7b2f47bc35a43b90.png"><br>  <i>Battery Pack Mugen Power 5400 mAh</i>

      The Chinese counterpart under No. 2 also came in a single pack with a dummy polyethylene inside. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/33d/d81/75a/33dd8175a79e68274e9ff9765b90db23.png"><br>  <i>Packing a Chinese 5200 mAh battery</i> <br><br>  The only possible trouble was that I ordered it without tracking tracking, so there was a possibility not to see it at all, but everything worked out.  Both parcels were sent almost simultaneously and arrived almost simultaneously, after 25 days ¬± 1-2 days. <br><br><h3>  Appearance </h3><br>  After removing the <s>shackles of</s> protective films and other posting, the following samples appeared before my eyes. <br><br>  As I said above, sample No. 1 perfectly fits the lid of sample No. 3, but the Chinese colleague under No. 2 immediately disappointed me: <br><ul><li>  firstly, the ‚Äúnative‚Äù cover does not want to enter the ‚Äúnative‚Äù slots on the phone case (although you can modify the file with a well, or there is always a way out in the form of blue tape;)) </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8a8/201/86e/8a820186e8b6bf41b26a1113e998469f.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/78b/25e/e93/78b25ee93d34d53c2d1fb36215ee1635.png"><br>  <i>Incorrect grooves of the cover from the Chinese battery 5200 mAh</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/259/033/027/259033027c027b9fed03944d16f9825f.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/731/e78/5aa/731e785aa8f22cbe07ceee1808908503.png"><br>  <i>Because of the wrong grooves of the lid, it stubbornly refuses to close</i> <br><br><ul><li>  secondly, sample No. 2 turned out to be thicker than its brothers under number 1 or 4 and therefore the Mugen Power battery cover could not become a worthy replacement for the Chinese brother </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d0e/732/565/d0e732565ef5ebea123c305a3602aba8.png"><br>  <i>Comparison of the sizes of accumulators ‚Ññ1, ‚Ññ2 and ‚Ññ4</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/df9/938/163/df9938163cd00773b1c4daa9a011450c.png"><br>  <i>All tested samples (it is clear that the sizes of samples No. 1 and No. 3 are equal)</i> <br><br>  And the covers themselves are not very similar: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3b6/e54/391/3b6e5439114d16556413a60661314bba.png"><br>  <i>Comparison of sample covers ‚Ññ1 and ‚Ññ2</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5cc/e4c/273/5cce4c273fb290a734fc4103901a4e61.png"><br>  <i>Comparison of all sample covers</i> <br><br>  Because of this, testing of sample No. 2 had to be carried out at home, because carrying the phone for that kind of money with the battery outward looks at least strange. <br><br>  Phone without covers looks <s>like a pregnant cockroach</s> as I expected, not very nice, but for the sake of increased energy, you can suffer.  Moreover, when assembled, it is not that much that it interferes in your everyday life. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/084/36e/341/08436e3412dd7f0120ca870111dbfbcb.png"><br>  <i>Phone with battery and without a cover (top-down sample number 1 and number 2)</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/be0/b77/dc0/be0b77dc0a2c1b495a249157e994c4e6.png"><br>  <i>The general plan of the phone (duplicated from the last post)</i> <br><br><h3>  Testing </h3><br>  Testing was conducted in 3 areas: <br><ol><li>  load test from Antutu Tester <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4ab/c14/f78/4abc14f781a3c6372d87b4f332ac25e9.png">  - measured in "parrots" </li><li>  Battery charging test from 1% to 100% </li><li>  The test of maximum endurance in time. <br>  The same conditions were created for all the batteries: Wi-Fi and 3G were turned on all the time, the phone was used both for surfing and for reading for the same time, directly proportional to the capacity of the battery </li></ol><br><h6>  1. Load test from Antutu Tester </h6><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3dc/5ff/aac/3dc5ffaace0556caf2ff7b2b31045e1c.png"><br>  <i>From left to right (sample number 1, number 2, number 3 and number 4)</i> <br><br>  I was surprised by the indicators for sample No. 2, specially rechecked 2 times (maybe this lid affects, without it, testing was carried out;)) <br><br><h6>  2. Test for battery charging time from 1% to 100% </h6><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c88/add/761/c88add761f5732e4da0f1e82a5cf689e.png"><br>  <i>From left to right (sample number 1, number 2, number 3 and number 4)</i> <br><br>  No wonder: the larger the capacity, the longer it takes to charge (thanks to Cap;)).  True, the spread between 5200 and 5400 is quite large, but this is explained by the following test. <br><br><h6>  3. Test the maximum endurance time </h6><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8e4/899/994/8e4899994f2c27634fc12ffcb1020ab5.png"><br>  <i>From left to right (sample number 1, number 2, number 3 and number 4)</i> <br><br>  It was here that the smaller charging time came out sideways for samples No. 1 and No. 2 almost commensurate with the volume.  If you look at the activity of use, all the containers were approximately equally spent, but the result is most likely predictable: more capacity - more time (your KO). <br><br><h3>  findings </h3><br>  This post was created not to prove the last quotation from Captain Obviousness, but to check: are the batteries sent almost from the same city really, but at different prices (sample No. 1 approximately 8 times more expensive than sample 2) can compete together? <br>  My answer is no: <br><ul><li>  irregular shape of the cover, which cannot be fixed without a file; </li><li>  slightly smaller capacity and strikingly different amounts that did not pay off; </li><li>  the lack of confidence that this miracle of Chinese thought will not blow your telephone; </li></ul><br>  You can buy 8 of these batteries and believe that one of them will suit your phone, but I would not risk it, all the same phone is more important.  That is why the battery from the Chinese noname I put on the shelf, as a last resort, when you just need it, but there will be no alternative.  But the chance that this happens seems so scanty, I take into account that my total capacity already exceeds 10 Ah. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/153425/">https://habr.com/ru/post/153425/</a></p>
