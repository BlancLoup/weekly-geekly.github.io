If you are a freelancer, you must have dealt with bank cards.  Now in the Russian market there is a huge offer of cards, ranging from banking bonuses, ending with discount and bonus from cafes to airlines. <br>  Just want to say that the post in any way is not advertising.  Here only my opinion and my experience in relation to Russian banks and their cards.  In the review, I used only those banks with which I worked personally. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/00c/db2/01b/00cdb201b6aabf767cb410cb26604ac2.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Perhaps I'll start with a bank that I used for about 5 years.  It seemed to me that everything was perfect for him, but later it turned out that the proposal was not very competitive either.

    <h4>  Alfa Bank </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/da1/1e4/255/da11e4255be2efd9979d9d41480c63e0.jpg"><br>  As I said above, I used the services of this bank for a very long time.  Bank fees start at 59 rubles for the account + card.  For this amount, you get a regular card, without a chip, not to mention fast payment technology (PayPass, PayWave).  At first, it suited me, then when not accumulating certain payments, I was offered a free switch to a steeper tariff, which included several free cards with a chip, and even for a small amount you could take a card with NFC payments (Paypass, PayWave), and Depending on the amount in your bank account, you may be charged a fee altogether.  More information about tariffs and service packages can be found here <a href="http://alfabank.ru/retail/tariff_plans/">http://alfabank.ru/retail/tariff_plans/</a> <br><br>  In this bank, I liked everything.  The office is nearby, and there are many ATMs (Alpha has many partners in which you can withdraw cash without interest), and convenient withdrawal-deposit into electronic money, and payment for anything via the Internet bank (although this is not surprising now). <br>  Separately, the word Internet bank.  At AlfaBank, it is called Alpha Click.  In my opinion, a very convenient Internet bank with high security.  I remember that I recently restored the lost sim card to which Alpha Click was attached, without changing the number.  And when I tried to login to the Internet bank, they showed me a sign that the sim card was restored, access was denied.  I had to call and identify my identity.  Honestly, it's a mystery to me how they define it, but it probably helps close cooperation with Beeline. <br>  Well, again, now probably you won't surprise anyone with a functional Internet bank.  I will note probably a clear advantage.  The first is the ability to create a virtual card for payment on the Internet, with a given limit.  Secondly, this is the designer of cards with an individual design, you can make the design of the card from any picture. <br>  And now I will say about the main disadvantage.  I always didn‚Äôt like the fact that I don‚Äôt have interest on my money.  It was necessary either to make a contribution, or to make another account which would drop 3-5 percent per annum for the minimum balance per month.  For example, if you had 100,000 on the card, and you spent 90,000, and then put 90,000 again, then you will only receive 10,000 percent per month. This is not very convenient, and my money goes all the time.  Cash back on the card is also not charged, although it is worth noting that the bank has a lot of cards with additional benefits, for the accumulation of bonuses, miles, and so on.  Read more about maps <a href="http://alfabank.ru/retail/cards/">http://alfabank.ru/retail/cards/</a> <br>  It is worth noting that the bank has very cool smartphone apps.  With the search for the nearest ATM and viewing queues in the offices. <br>  But I soon left this bank.  If you wonder why I left and where I went, read below. <br><br><h4>  Tinkoff Bank </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e9b/f45/734/e9bf45734f4d93e62882375f3c02eeaa.jpg"><br><br>  You know, for the time being, I was very infuriated by the Tinkoff Bank.  I don‚Äôt even know why this bank caused me such feelings, maybe because of annoying online advertising, maybe because I heard from someone that the bank is not good at knocking out debts on loans, maybe because what <br>  But one day everything changed.  Wandering through the internet, I accidentally stumbled upon an article about a new service from this bank.  It was about a debit card. <br>  Turning to the page of this card, I realized this is what I need!  I understand that now it smells of advertising and PR, but you decide what it is.  Now let's get more. <br>  The first thing I liked was the accumulation of interest on the card.  For an amount of up to 200,000, they accumulate 10% per annum, and the percentage is not accumulated on the minimum balance for the month like Alpha, but is calculated daily on the balance.  After 200,000, they accumulate 5%.  And if you have 300,000 on the map, then 10% will drop to 200,000, and 5% to the remaining 100,000.  agree, the money is not big, but still nice. <br>  The second is cash back.  What I, a fan of bonuses, really like.  With each purchase, you are returned 0.5% of the spent amount for any purchase and as much as 5% for purchases by categories established by the bank.  This month, for example, I get 5 percent for clothes and shoes, movies and sports goods.  There are even goods for which all 10% will be returned to you. <br>  Third, free cash withdrawals at any ATM, if you withdraw from 3000 rubles. <br>  Fourth, by default you are immediately sent a card with an integrated NFC chip, for payment using PayPass technology. <br>  Fifth, the courier delivers the card for free.  I don‚Äôt know about the regions, I live in Moscow, after making a map on the site, in two days the courier brought it to me. <br>  Sixth, online banking application for all platforms, including Blackberry 10. <br>  Well, the seventh thing I like a lot is a very beautiful and functional internet bank.  I will not speak now about the fact that through it you can pay, anything, in my opinion now any self-respecting bank allows.  What I like are the various widgets and the full card management.  Unlike Alfabank, any service, such as SMS info, SMS bank can be turned on and off directly in your account.  And most importantly, the chip from which I am dragging is the automatic sorting of your purchases into categories.  For example: restaurants, gasoline, food.  Everything is very beautifully done, with a diagram and icons of stores. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6ff/6cb/5f2/6ff6cb5f2f4ae8785ea42d133f0859d7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Card servicing costs 99 rubles a month, if you have a deposit in this bank, then you do not need to pay anything at all.  The card has the status of Platinum, which gives you a number of additional features. <br><br>  Well, now about the cons. <br>  First of all, I personally don‚Äôt like that the bank has a mentality of a credit bank and when you shine somewhere with your card, everyone thinks that you live on credit, because when you mention Tinkoff Bank, they all immediately think about loans. <br>  Second, I really miss the custom design feature for the card. <br>  Third, I don‚Äôt like that all accumulated bonuses and cash back are charged only once a month. <br>  Fourth, the reliability of the bank.  Of course, if you compare AlfaBank and Tinkoff Bank, then Alpha is just a leader.  But for those who are afraid for their funds, I will say that your money is insured in the state Deposit Insurance System.  As far as I remember, she insures amounts only up to 700,000 rubles. <br>  You can order a card and see the details here <a href="https://www.tcsbank.ru/debit/">https://www.tcsbank.ru/debit/</a> <br><br><h4>  Svyaznoy Bank </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/051/273/1a0/0512731a0123c85233793774bcefd248.jpg"><br><br>  I had another bank in my life, which gave me a lot of bonuses.  But I will not write in detail and much about him, since I used it quite a bit.  I'll start with the pros. <br>  1) 1% of all purchases on the Internet and up to 20% for purchases from partners: in pharmacies RIGLA, cafe Shokoladnitsa, Wabi Saby, Teremok;  stores "Ol!  Hood "," Magnolia ";  on the portal Ozon.ru and other partners.  But it all came back in the form of bonuses that can be spent there. <br>  2) Full card management via mobile phone. <br>  3) Excellent online banking <br>  On this pluses probably ended.  And now the most important disadvantage: The card balance at any given time cannot exceed 15,000 rubles. <br>  That is why I threw this card. <br>  <b>upd.</b>  I had a limited card (Bargain Card).  How are things with other cards, more cool, I do not know. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/171859/">https://habr.com/ru/post/171859/</a></p>
