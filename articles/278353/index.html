      We cannot focus on a few paragraphs of the text.  We read social media, repos ‚ÄúVkontakte‚Äù length at best in kilobytes and tiny notes on Facebook.  We have a global attention deficit.  In this regard, reading any article turns into a little torture.  Well, or at best, in mental work.  I constantly see comments that clearly say that the commentator did not read the article.  And there are comments that hint with all their tone that they did a favor by reading the post. <br><br>  <strong>We think we are obliged.</strong> <br><br>  We are terribly different.  Someone writes code, someone adjusts the equipment, someone draws icons.  Yes, even the posts of two coders to each other will hardly be interesting.  We write posts that are interesting to our tiny little group of people.  And then we wonder why the voting system does not particularly appreciate this very important post for us.  Well, do not need the average sysadmin audio effects Adobe Premiere Pro.  This post will not see its advantage, since it is not subscribed to such a hub.  So such a masterpiece post for someone in the first place does not come out.  What to do?  Yes, every text is an effort.  But it is impossible to force people to read. <br><br>  But the posts of general subjects are perceived well.  They interest many.  And it is not surprising that a hastily made technical post about a girl crucified by a copywriting girl will collect much more advantages than an excellent guide to the specifics of setting up a web server hosting a particular small hosting provider.  Just the first is interesting and useful to many.  And the second is useful in life, not everyone.  These are just voices.  Do not think that the community does not appreciate the posts of the second type.  Do not think that writing posts of the first type is shameful. <br><br>  <strong>We do not like to write more.</strong> <br><br>  What generally to do on "Habr√©"?  All that is from the site is a form of creating new posts, a post tape and comments under them.  Writing posts is an extremely fascinating process, during which you can examine in detail the topic under consideration.  Then, almost always other people come to the comments, people are smarter than the author of the post, who explain what was wrong in understanding the topic.  Meanwhile, we perceive the obligation to have one post on your account as undeserved torture.  If you do not write posts, then what is there to do?  There are enough useless commentators.  I know, because I myself was a useless commentator who came to the site by accident. <br><br>  <strong>We love to whine.</strong> <br><br>  We love to whine that the numbers of the counters under the posts are small.  Meanwhile, we forget that large to anything.  Why three hundred comments, if most of it is useless?  Better thirty, but in the case.  Why +150 under the post, if it is so clear that he is good?  Better than +20, but from real people who were interested in the post, not cheaters.  Why one hundred, two hundred thousand views?  Yes, and from where?  There will not be as many Russian-speaking IT specialists who would be interested in the highly specialized guide for deploying PostgreSQL on Raspberry Pi.  Therefore, there will be five, ten, twenty thousand, but people who are not here by chance.  Of these, units will share their experiences.  Understandable to many topic pick up more. <br><br>  We love to whine that "Habr" killed.  Killed someone else.  Not we.  We monthly roll up tantrums and posts in the style of "why" Habr "is dead."  Then we tear up these carts with savory cries that someone did something wrong.  Perhaps the system of karma is to blame: look at mine.  Perhaps the point is the greed of the owners of the site: look at the advertising banners and Jeans!  Perhaps, the point is in the general rolling up of the level of posts: look, to read this post and the candidate is not needed! <br><br>  <strong>We do not want to admit that it‚Äôs about us.</strong> <br><br>  And all you have to do is read and write posts and comments.  This is the whole essence of the community.  We just spilled, and no longer wish to do this. <br><br>  Change is normal.  Perhaps we grew up, got wives, children and cats.  But we all fear change.  Therefore, we are looking for external causes. <br><br>  Does the karma system interfere with writing?  For placement there is a reset of karma.  And do not say that it does not work - everything functions perfectly as planned.  You can comment on frank nonsense, type minuses to such an extent that you can only write to other users.  Then reset and start writing posts like all white people.  Everything is real.  I know, since I myself went through the reset of karma. <br><br>  Is there something bad that simple topics are touched upon?  We are so different.  There is nothing wrong with someone writing a post about astronautics or banning another site.  They will not interfere - they were taken to another site. <br><br>  Does the administration personally interfere with writing something?  Deniskin personally comes to my house every night and deletes my drafts.  Bumburum sleeps and sees how to rub the comments and posts.  Moderation terrible, and all udyayut?  On the contrary, the resource is actually set free.  On the contrary, authors are stimulated by PPA, attention and other buns.  You just write, the author, write. <br><br>  Did all the team of authors-editors kill, which periodically gives out all sorts of pearls?  Meanwhile, the authors are not typed from the street, but simply offered to write to several users.  Revision - this is the community. <br><br>  Is it business blogs companies?  They also need to subscribe.  It is generally difficult for me to understand such filtering problems, since I pass several hundred headlines through the RCC a day.  Not interested - not reading, what problems?  And many posts from companies' blogs are far from advertising, but informative.  Exactly the same could write ordinary users. <br><br>  Are comments so famously minus?  I have already seen all these pleas that minus for nothing.  After that, I open the comments of this author and see the same nonsense: a person is deservedly minus.  I regularly see in posts frank nonsense in the comments.  He merges.  And then these same people whine that they are minus for nothing.  And the minus is quite correct.  I know, since I myself wrote crap comments.  And it was just me who was to blame for the merged karma. <br><br>  Well what to do, people have opinions.  If silently minus even an opinion based on references on technical topics is a sign of decay.  There is no such thing on ‚ÄúHabr√©‚Äù.  Even in the post about the ‚Äúapple‚Äù technique or policy, the polite comment of the dissenter is either mistaken or explained to him what is wrong.  The arrogant "and here I am, listen to my unwarranted opinion" will be pampered anywhere.  I know, since I wrote and saw both kinds of comments. <br><br>  This is a professional community.  Here are addressed to "you."  Here explain and share knowledge. <br><br>  These are technical issues.  There are almost always the right decisions, and there are wrong ones.  Here minus the wrong and plus the right.  Yes, there are questions that have many correct answers.  But these are few, but a reasonable opinion does not merge. <br><br>  This is something from psychology, I guess.  Something about the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A4%25D1%2583%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25BE%25D1%2588%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B1%25D1%2583%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8">fundamental attribution error</a> and <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259B%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BA%25D1%2583%25D1%2581_%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D1%258F">locus of control</a> .  I'm not the one who is to blame, but someone else.  The site is bad.  Well, I did not do something wrong. <br><br>  Meanwhile, it would be possible to learn normal behavior in a decent society.  Where they are asked not to come again, they put a minus here.  Just a minus.  On some site.  Well, so what? <br><br>  Yes, and it does not matter.  Here it is still reset and little effect on that.  But you can look at and adjust your behavior so that in real life it‚Äôs not for the monitor to behave adequately.  You just need to change the tone of communication. <br><br>  Of course, what I have described does not always work.  Someone minus undeservedly.  Someone flew just like that.  Someone is right in his criticism. <br><br>  Habr as a site has a million problems.  For example, for myself I had to make a rule to write comments only when necessary, when I have something to add.  How to solve this and other problems, no one knows.  But in general, the karma system works.  It is simply the realization of community self-regulation.  That self-regulation, through which you can immediately, without pre-moderation, publish a new post.  The appearance of the site is determined by us, the community site. <br><br>  You can learn to clearly express your thoughts.  You can get comments to articles or write them yourself.  You can learn good behavior.  You can just read. <br><br>  <strong>But we do not want to do this.</strong> <br><br>  Habr is neither better nor worse.  It is still the same, even with the redesign.  Trivia site have become different.  But first of all we have changed.  Perhaps we have become too good for such a site.  Perhaps we have nothing to write about.  And if there is anything, the topics are not so exciting. <br><br>  The point is only in our participation in the community.  The point is ourselves.  We are lazy.  Or just grown.  And we demand to do as before, when everything was different.  But otherwise in our lives, not "Habr√©". </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/278353/">https://habr.com/ru/post/278353/</a></p>
