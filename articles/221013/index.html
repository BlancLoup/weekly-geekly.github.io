"This song is the very embodiment of the romance of space exploration." <a href="http://lenta.ru/articles/2013/05/14/oddity/">Writes</a> Lenta.ru) <br><br>  In his speech, Chris raises the question of what to do with his fear, tells a little about what it is like to get into a rocket when the chance to die 1 out of 40. The Canadian astronaut concerns the fear of spiders and shares how the training center prepares that being in a situation for which was not ready, be prepared. <br><br>  This month, the video gained 1,000,000+ views.  But the Russian transcription is not yet. <br>  Since on Habr√© ‚ÄúCosmonautics‚Äù is quite a popular topic, I think that there will be several habrazhiteli that will help with the translation. <br>  The lecture transcript is divided into approximately one-minute segments (a total of 13 pieces).  I propose to take one by one, translate and put in the comments (but do not repeat). <br>  I also urge you to make your recommendations in the ready-made versions of the translation.

Your Ad Here Xenon lights, you can go off the planet.</i> <br>  So I put on my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure_suit">high-rise compensating suit</a> and go on the bus on the road leading to the launch platform - in Astro bus - taxiing from around the corner of the space center, at dawn, in the distance you can see, illuminated by huge xenon lamps, your spacecraft - a transport that will take you away from this planet. <br><br>  <i>It can be a bit bigger, it‚Äôs a bit harder</i> <br>  The crew is sitting in the Astro-bus, which has become quiet, almost holding hands, looks at how the ship becomes more and more. <br><br>  Two o'clock <br>  I‚Äôm going to ride the car up and down, I‚Äôm going to go back to your back.  It‚Äôs a real life, it‚Äôs a real challenge. many minutes of actually happening.  In the astronaut business - it is a very complicated vehicle;  it's the most complicated flying machine ever built.  You can‚Äôt make it worse.  (Laughter);  You can‚Äôt go through. <br><br>  Three o'clock <br>  This excitement is building.  It has been a lot of time for the whole vehicle, it has to you like an elephant getting up  The APUs are running, it is ready to go.  And 15 seconds before launch, this happens: (Video) Voice: 12, 11, 10, nine, eight, seven, six - (Space shuttle preparing for takeoff) - start, two, one, booster ignition, and liftoff shuttle Discovery, returning to the space station, paving the way ... (Space shuttle taking off) <br><br>  4:09 <br>  Chris Hadfield: It is incredibly powerful.  You are in the grip of something that is vastly more powerful than yourself.  You can‚Äôt focus on the instruments.  There is a lot of space for you to relax. Seeing your wipes with a smile and a smile on your face.  In the end of the 19th century, it‚Äôs possible to complete the process.  It gets heavier and heavier.  It feels like someone's pouring cement on you or something.  If you‚Äôve been running, you can‚Äôt get it.  And we're alive. <br>  It's an amazing experience.  But why would we take that risk?  Why would you do something that dangerous? <br><br>  5:26 <br>  In my case the answer is fairly straightforward.  I wanted to do.  I‚Äôm not sure why I‚Äôm not really interested in what I mean.  It comes from it?  How do you deal with fear versus danger?  In the end of the day, she‚Äôd be It is a rule of thumb for a man of 200 experiments inside. <br><br>  6:21 <br>  It could be even more importantly, it could be a drop. This is the world itself.  And you see, because of the speed, a sunset or a sunset every 45 minutes for half a year.  This is the most magnificent part of spacewalk.  You are going through your spacesuit.  You are not looking at the universe.  Turn around beside you. <br><br>  7:26 <br>  By it mesmerizingly next to you.  If you want to stick your hair, you can stick it.  and you are one of the seven seven billion people.  I was spacewalk <br>  I‚Äôm not sure why.  I couldn‚Äôt figure it out.  I was thinking, what do I do next?  I thought, well maybe thats why I had two eyes, so I kept working.  But unfortunately, without gravity, tears don't fall.  It is a little bit that she eventually gets the ball. I was completely blind outside the spaceship. <br><br>  8:34 <br>  So what's the scariest thing you've ever done?  (Laughter) Maybe it's spiders.  A lot of people are afraid of spiders.  I think you‚Äôre creepy and I‚Äôm not afraid of you.  If you‚Äôre a little bit blunt, you could‚Äôt be sitting right in front of you.  And how do you know?  This is why spiders are scary.  But then you couldn‚Äôt say, you‚Äôre sitting back beside me or not?  I don't know.  Are there brown recluses here?  There are about 50,000 different types of spiders, and you can‚Äôt find out about 50,000. <br><br>  9:24 <br>  And there you are in Canada, there are 720, 730 different types of spirits, and there is one a nasty sting.  Spider has beautiful markings, it's like ‚ÄúI'm dangerous.  It‚Äôs a bit of a radiation radiation pattern. ‚Äù" going to go through a web spider web where a black widow bites you.  Spider webs like this  And the spider eats the male;  it doesn't care about you.  So in fact, you can‚Äôt go to your caveman reaction.  The danger is completely different than the fear. <br><br>  10:17 <br>  How do you get around it, though?  How do you change your behavior?  Well, make sure you have a good look, make sure you‚Äôre a black widow spider, and then go to it.  And then you see another spiderweb and walk into that one.  It's just a little bit of fluffy stuff.  It's not a big deal.  Lady spitting it up.  If you want to go through the spiderwebs, you can‚Äôt make it. or whatever, into your own basement.  And you can apply this to anything. <br>  If you want to panic, I think.  It would make you feel nervous and worried.  But we had considered all the venom, and we had practiced with the whole variety of different spiderwebs.  We knew everything there was to know.  You must be walking through those spiderwebs. <br><br>  11:29 <br>  It‚Äôs like you‚Äôre realistic.  So when you finally get the spacewalk, you get it out first.  And even if you're blinded, your natural, panicky reaction does not happen.  I can hear you, I can hear you, Scott Parazynski is out here with me.  He could come over and help me. ‚ÄùI‚Äôve actually been practicing an incapacitated crew rescue.  I could find my own way back.  It's not nearly as big a deal.  If you are going to be working, then you‚Äôll keep working.  He added that he had to make it to the bottom of the floor. in my eye.  Johnson's No More Tears, which we probably should have been using.  (Laughter) <br><br>  12:39 <br>  Where is the real risk?  What is the real thing?  Not just a generic fear of bad things happening.  It is a fact that it can be completely denied to you ... <br>  It is a clear idea that it can be seen as a dream.  You can‚Äôt have your fears.  You‚Äôre a beauty that otherwise never would have happened. <br><br>  13:38 <br>  It's time to come home at the end.  This is our spaceship, the Soyuz, that little one.  Three spaces of us climb in, and then this spaceships from the station and falls into the atmosphere.  Here are the details.  It‚Äôs a little bit that you‚Äôre riding a meteorite and you‚Äôre a meteorite.  If you‚Äôve found a girlfriend, you‚Äôre It has been shown that the orbital mechanics has been applied.  This is a 15-kilometer circle anywhere on the Earth.  So in fact, we were not screaming, we were laughing;  it was fun.  It was a nice little clockwork mechanism. <br>  Soyuz, in Kazakhstan. <br><br>  15:04 <br>  (Video) Reporter: Russian Mi-8 helicopters.  Touchdown - 3:14 and 48 seconds, am Central Time.  It‚Äôs a little fun.  And then eventually you‚Äôll be able to get out, you can‚Äôt get it.  You can‚Äôt be scared, you can‚Äôt It could be possible otherwise.  Just to finish, they asked me to play that guitar.  I‚Äôm not sure that I‚Äôve been singing this song. take our own self-perception into a new place. <br><br><h4>  PS </h4><br>  David Bowie- Space Oddity Original Video (1969) <br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/D67kmFzSh_o%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgiWgV_oAqca3CIyAHXsvJWJ042zA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Space Oddity (withdrawn in connection with the complaint of the copyright holder) <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/KaOC9danxNo%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhtiY2zhkNPKfxAEnqQvTbA3s6ZoA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The history of the song on the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Oddity_(%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BD%25D1%258F)">wiki</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/221013/">https://habr.com/ru/post/221013/</a></p>
