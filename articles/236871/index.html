High-performance wireless networks have long ceased to be a luxury for companies and become a necessity.  Despite all this, often the wireless network stands apart from the wired campus network with its own equipment, management, its own settings and policies.

      It's time to change the approach and simplify the work, deployment and administration of wireless networks! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The <b>HP</b> <b>Unified Wired and Wireless Network</b> solution <b>,</b> part of the <b>HP</b> <b>FlexNetwork</b> architecture <b>, is</b> <b>intended to help</b> . <br>  First of all, this solution includes a new line of equipment, namely, wireless access controllers / switches. <br><br>  Let's start with the <b>HP 830 Unified Wired-WLAN Switch</b> : <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b55/830/d39/b55830d390a5494f853c0f6a8d1104b4.jpg"><br>  The HP 830 Unified Wired-WLAN Switch series combines a wireless access controller and a gigabit PoE + switch. <br><br>  This implementation is convenient for the organization of wireless networks of small and medium scales, as it allows you to make an access network using a single device.  Such a network will be scalable, since the number of access points supported by the controller can be extended with licenses to 60 access points to the controller. <br><br>  As a result, we get: <br>  ‚Ä¢ Unified management and policies for LAN and WLAN users; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Unified management with IMC; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Built-in portal authentication server and IEEE 802.1X; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Switches with 8 and 24 GbE PoE + ports; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Wi-Fi Clear Connect technology for optimizing wireless networks. <br><br>  Learn more about the <a href="http://h17007.www1.hp.com/us/en/networking/products/mobility/HP_830_Unified_Wired-WLAN_Switch_Series/index.aspx">HP 830 Unified Wired-WLAN Switch</a> . <br><br>  For larger solutions, a more powerful <b>HP</b> <b>850 Unified Wired-WLAN Appliance</b> controller, which has 8 Gigabit combo ports and 2 10G interfaces, is suitable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/870/3db/1b7/8703db1b7a5a47728e134882a85f4363.png"><br>  This device provides support for up to 512 access points to the controller with a centralized bandwidth of 10G.  A distinctive feature of HP 850 controllers and older is the support of 1 + 1 redundancy controllers, with the detection time of the main controller failing in terms of milliseconds.  The presence of IEEE 802.1X hot-backup functionality, which synchronizes the 802.1X state along with information about the connected clients between the controllers, allows you to save client connections when the primary controller fails.  Also, do not forget about the possibility of redundant power supplies. <br><br>  For more information, see the <a href="http://h17007.www1.hp.com/us/en/networking/products/mobility/HP_850_Unified_Wired-WLAN_Appliance_Series/index.aspx">HP 850 Unified Wired-WLAN Appliance</a> . <br><br>  The next in line is an even more powerful <b>HP</b> <b>870 Unified Wired-WLAN Appliance</b> controller, which has 40G bandwidth and provides 1536 access points. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e2b/f4e/d1a/e2bf4ed1aecc4e769df12b734e37a09d.png"><br>  The device has 12 copper and 12 SFP gigabit interfaces, as well as 4 SFP + interfaces.  The controller also features redundant power supplies and IEEE 802.1X hot-backup technology, which makes it possible to ensure uninterrupted operation of all access points as a central controller of a wireless LAN for large companies and large-scale implementations. <br><br>  Read more here <a href="http://h17007.www1.hp.com/us/en/networking/products/mobility/HP_870_Unified_Wired-WLAN_Switch_Series/index.aspx">HP 870 Unified Wired-WLAN Appliance</a> . <br><br>  For large solutions with HP wired network, the controller is also implemented as a service card <b>HP 10500/7500 20G Unified Wired-WLAN Module</b> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/da9/ee2/928/da9ee29281bf49d79d59d279d1f19eea.png"><br>  As the name implies, this module is suitable for the chassis switches of the HP 10500 and HP 7500 lines. The bandwidth of processing the traffic when deploying the centralized architecture of this module is 20G.  One module provides support for up to 1024 access points.  Increasing the number of such modules in the chassis, you can get 11264 access points supported by a single chassis.  Support for the ability to backup such modules, as well as 802.1X hot-backup functionality. <br><br>  In the most detailed way in <a href="http://h17007.www1.hp.com/us/en/networking/products/wireless/HP_10500_7500_20G_Unified_Wired-WLAN_Module/index.aspx">HP 10500/7500 20G Unified Wired-WLAN Module</a> . <br><br>  A few words about the functionality of the HP Unified Wired and Wireless Network solution: <br>  ‚Ä¢ Wi-Fi Clear Connect - radio frequency optimization technology, automatic noise reduction and dynamic load distribution, which provides a more efficient communication in high-density client environments; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Advanced radio resource management - automatic adjustment of radiation power, channel selection, balancing clients by access points, even distribution of environment usage time between clients; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Spectrum Analysis - spectral analysis, which allows to detect and avoid interference (including not from wi-fi devices); <br>  ‚Ä¢ Band Navigation - the ability to redirect clients supporting the 5 GHz band to the less susceptible 5 GHz band; <br>  ‚Ä¢ VLAN pooling - the ability to dynamically distribute clients across multiple VLANs within the same SSID; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Policy based forwarding - the ability to create policies that affect the direction of traffic, traffic classification based on ACL, the choice of centralized or distributed traffic flow direction.  Such policies can be applied to an SSID, a group of users, or to a specific user; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Quality of Service (QoS) - classification, policing and traffic prioritization; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Integrated Wireless Intrusion Detection System (WIDS) - built-in wireless intrusion detection network; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Integrated Wireless Intrusion Prevention System (WIPS) - integrated wireless network intrusion prevention system; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Wireless Intelligent Application Aware Feature (WIAA) - built-in firewall, working by SSID or by user roles; <br>  ‚Ä¢ NAT / NAT traversal - the possibility of address translation, as well as support for access points behind the NATOM; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Fast roaming - of course, fast roaming (including 3rd level); <br>  ‚Ä¢ High reliability - the ability of controllers to reserve each other in different ways (1 + 1, N + 1 and even N + N); <br>  ‚Ä¢ Bonjour support - support for the "apple" network protocol, which facilitates life and networking with Apple products; <br>  ‚Ä¢ And much more ... A more complete list can be found at the <a href="http://h18004.www1.hp.com/products/quickspecs/14832_div/14832_div.html">link</a> (section Overview). <br><br>  In order not to overload readers, information about other products included in the <b>HP</b> <b>Unified Wired and Wireless Network</b> in the following articles. <br>  Who can not wait, as well as other solutions / devices / trends and concepts, welcome to the <a href="http://h17007.www1.hp.com/us/en/networking/solutions/wlan/index.aspx">site Hewlett-Packard</a> . <br><br>  For the continuation of a series of articles on products that make up the <b>HP</b> <b>Unified Wired and Wireless Network</b> solution <b>,</b> return to Habrahabr! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/236871/">https://habr.com/ru/post/236871/</a></p>
