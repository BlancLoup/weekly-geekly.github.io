Recently downloaded it and put it.  Now I decided to share with you my impressions of one day of work on this system. <br><br><img src="http://zt50.ru/sev/1.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It did not want to be installed as an upgrade on my Russian Vista Ultimate due to the fact that the languages ‚Äã‚Äãdo not correspond.  And offered to otkapitsya and install a clean version.  I did not bounce, because  computer count is new and nothing terrible will not lose from data loss in the Users folder.  The installation is exactly the same as Vista.  Nothing new, except for asking even fewer questions.  It was very embarrassing that you need to enter the serial, but leaving the fields empty nothing terrible happened.  As it turned out, they give another 30 days of trial.  She delivered before the first launch of 20 minutes. Just so that I managed to make myself some coffee and watch the nice bootscreen. <br><br><img src="http://zt50.ru/sev/22.jpg">

    <img src="http://zt50.ru/sev/23.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://zt50.ru/sev/2.jpg"><br><br>  Let's start with the most delicious in my opinion.  With " <strong>super bar</strong> a".  The function in this version is disabled, but the guys from <a href="http://thevista.ru/">thevista.ru are</a> happily discovered and <a href="http://www.thevista.ru/page.php%3Fid%3D10449">enabled</a> .  By the way, they are trying to unlock other functions shown at the conference. <br><br>  <strong>Super bar</strong> . <br>  The start button remains the same as in whist.  Its content has slightly changed, but more on that later.  Now let's focus on the list of open programs.  Finally, normal and "cute" (read beautifully animated) work previews to the windows.  Even Winamp is displayed normally, albeit in a classic style, but still :) <br>  The cascade grouping has also changed - it is easier to close the windows with a cross in the left corner of the thumbnail. <br><br><img src="http://zt50.ru/sev/5.jpg"><br><br>  There was a kind of alternative to Makovsky dock.  Now applications can be <strong>attached</strong> to the taskbar.  You can also <strong>drag</strong> programs in it.  It's nice that this applies not only to the "glued" programs. <br><br><img src="http://zt50.ru/sev/6.jpg"><br><br>  When I was doing a print scan, I discovered that there is such a ‚Äúrecent‚Äù thing and it is supported by Photoshop.  Cool! <br><br>  Now pay attention to the <strong>tray</strong> . <br><br><img src="http://zt50.ru/sev/7.jpg"><br><br>  The language bar remained unchanged.  To connect to the network, you can now not climb into the start-&gt; connection, and click on the tray icon.  Maybe this could be done in whist, but for some reason I have not used it. <br><br><img src="http://zt50.ru/sev/8.jpg"><br><br>  Also updated security alerts.  The tooltip shows the number of versions according to the system version.  [offtop] Branmauer has grown wiser - now he can differentiate access to different networks [/ offtop] <br><br><img src="http://zt50.ru/sev/9.jpg"><br><br>  The sound mixer and device outages remained unchanged from whists. <br>  Now <strong>it is possible to infuse which icons will be constantly displayed in the tray</strong> : which ones will appear only during warnings and messages, and which ones will never appear at all.  Customization is also possible in the tooltip. <br><br><img src="http://zt50.ru/sev/10.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://zt50.ru/sev/21.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://zt50.ru/sev/11.jpg"><br><br>  Also to the right of the tray there is an inconspicuous button that minimizes all windows, and then (hooray) restores all of them into place.  Yes, and win + d now also restores to the place.  Maybe it was, too, but for some reason did not notice. <br><br>  <strong>Start.</strong> <br>  Start menu really changed very slightly.  There are no browser and email client buttons by default.  By the way, during installation, I was told that Mail, MovieMaker and something else third (forgot :() is no longer included in Windows. It seems the search has changed a bit. Yes, while making screenshots, I found that the scrolling position in the ‚ÄúAll Programs‚Äù tab is remembered A trifle, but nice :) <br><br><img src="http://zt50.ru/sev/12.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://zt50.ru/sev/13.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://zt50.ru/sev/14.jpg"><br><br>  <strong>Desktop.</strong> <br>  Gadgets appeared in the context menu.  The guys nevertheless decided to abandon the delusional idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa separate bar for them and now they can be placed directly on the desktop, although I never found how to drag them over it.  Also added screen resolution. <br><br><img src="http://zt50.ru/sev/15.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://zt50.ru/sev/16.jpg"><br><br>  <strong>Conductor.</strong> <br>  My computer got a new explorer bar.  In which there were some "Libraries" - a group consisting of contacts, pictures, videos, ... <br><br><img src="http://zt50.ru/sev/17.jpg"><br><br>  Changed and display files.  It seems they just changed the color scheme, and it became more pleasant. <br><br><img src="http://zt50.ru/sev/18.jpg"><br><br>  There was also a display item called ‚ÄúContents‚Äù. <br><br><img src="http://zt50.ru/sev/19.jpg"><br><br>  Also appeared a normal preview. <br><br><img src="http://zt50.ru/sev/20.jpg"><br><br>  <strong>General opinion.</strong> <br>  Everything else remains more or less the same as in whist. <br>  I will not show standard applications with them so the entire Internet is full.  But the ribbon interface in WordPad, IMHO, a perversion - there is only one tab. <br><br>  The system got up perfectly and works: firefox 3.2 (with all the plugins of course), zend studio 6.1, winamp 5.541, photoshop cs3, qip inflinum 9018, winrar 3.X, appsev 2.5.10 (apache 2.2.8, mysql, php5).  As well as a lot of inconspicuous, which I used to ignore, but put. <br><br>  Zend Studio 5.5.1 got up to the system perfectly, but for obscure reasons refused to work.  Those.  it starts up, shows the download window, and then mret without issuing a squeak. <br><br>  The system was put Fallout 3 from 1C.  Why the crooked rose Russification.  It was played normally, without lags, at high settings, which were established themselves at the first launch.  By the way, I want to say ‚Äúthank you‚Äù to the bestede for the cool clotting and deployability of the alt-tab toy.  The same battlefield 2142 is very stupid at the same time. <br><br>  The drivers got up all by themselves, except for the Attansic L1 Gigabit Ethernet 10/100 / 1000Base-T network card (where it came from on the board is not clear. Even it was terrible to print).  Thinking, I downloaded another fresh Ati Catalyst, but everything worked fine and so. <br><br>  In general, I will say that it is not even bad.  Especially for Milestone 3. Whist faster or not?  I will not say.  Rather the same.  But it communicates with files much faster.  Sometimes there are some ‚Äúfreezes‚Äù for 1-2 seconds.  But this is not fatal, IMHO. <br><br>  Yes, the system was installed on: Intel Pentium Dual Core 2.20 GHZ, Asus p5b se socket 775, 2048MB DDR2, 512Mb HD3600, 320Gb Western Digital 7200rpm. <br><br>  <strong>Thank you all for your attention.</strong> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/44093/">https://habr.com/ru/post/44093/</a></p>
