  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What is Kenevin and a little about the conference Lean Kanban Russia</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  How long have you changed your job?  If yes, then maybe with you or with your colleagues this situation happened - when you move from one company to another, you begin to see the same problems and try to make decisions based on previous experience, but in this case it only aggravated the situation.  Moreover, you start looking for reasons that people do not work well enough and everything will work out, you just need to wait or something else.  In short, despite all the surroundings and signals, you firmly believe that you are right.  After all, it seems counter-logical - do not trust your experience.  This is called ‚ÄúExpert Trap‚Äù - you become a hostage to your experience, it seems to you that everything is simple and you make inappropriate decisions, sometimes leading to a deep crisis in management. <br><br><blockquote>  For example: I had such a story with a friend.  He is a successful project manager who successfully completed several projects using Scrum.  Everything was great - the scaling worked perfectly, the customer was satisfied, the quality was excellent, the teams were on the rise, the release, the plans and velocity are stable and predictable, in general, everything is fine.  And here he is invited to another large Russian company, and he sees a mess there, and his first reaction is ‚Äúso, to All Scrum!‚Äù <br>  And the situation, of course, is not very different in terms of disorder from the previous one, if only by the scale, but it differs in the specifics of work and interaction of people, and the results of the ‚ÄúAll Scrumovsky‚Äù policy certainly help, but not for long.  Then begins howl ‚Äúyour Scrum does not work‚Äù - and our, until recently, successful manager is already going to be fired. </blockquote><br><h5>  What to do? </h5><br>  It turns out that we must be able to make a decision and understand when our experience is a plus and it is worth using, and it happens that a minus and it only prevents us from making a decision that is appropriate for the context. <br>  That is why I want to tell you about the Cynefin / "Kenevin" framework.  This is one of the main methods of <a href="http://cognitive-edge.com/">Cognitive Edge</a> , which allows managers to look at things from new perspectives, learn complex concepts, and solve real problems.  Using the Kenevin framework can help managers feel the situation they are in, so that they can not only make better decisions, but also avoid the problems that arise when their standard management style makes mistakes. <br><br>  Simply put, Kenevin and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensemaking">Sensemaking</a> (still a buzzword :)) in general - mercilessly break all General Management concepts that are taught in everyone's favorite MBA programs or other courses of classical management.  Do you want your company to have Business Flexibility not only at the level of a team or IT-department, but to develop as a Complex Adaptive System, resistant to different types of uncertainty?  And now there is plenty of uncertainty at all levels of government. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I remembered this framework for a reason, of course.  Dave Snowden, co-founder of Cognitive Edge and one of the main authors of KENEVINA, is coming to Moscow for the <a href="http://leankanban.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_campaign%3Dsmm%26utm_medium%3Dblog1_video">Lean Kanban Russia</a> conference, which I highly recommend visiting all C-level managers.  At the conference, Dave will make a presentation on ‚ÄúThink and act in a new way‚Äù: he will tell you that in order to build successful companies, managers must learn to think outside the framework of personal experience and focus on the unique specifics of current tasks. .

      I translated and voiced a short vidosik, which allows you to more or less understand why this framework is needed. <br>  Pay attention, by the way, to the difference between the ‚Äúbest‚Äù solutions and ‚Äúgood‚Äù solutions: <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/rCLth07UAsA%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700002,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjo-XBMzsbmw_SjOsRr9mNmogCyQA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  In addition to participating directly in the conference, Dave will also hold a separate two-day training course on the use of the Kenevin framework, which you can register <a href="http://scrumtrek.ru/trainings/view/68/114/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_campaign%3DSMM%26utm_medium%3Dblog1_video">here</a> . <br><br>  In general, come. <br><br>  If you are not a high-level manager yet, give your supervisor an idea to go to this conference. <br>  Your boss will thank you :) I guarantee! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/237413/">https://habr.com/ru/post/237413/</a></p>
