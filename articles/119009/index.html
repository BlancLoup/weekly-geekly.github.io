  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Optimize PNG and JPEG without losing quality. Part 1</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h4>  Introduction </h4><br>  I offer you a review dedicated to the optimization of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics">PNG</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG">JPEG</a> images without loss of quality.  By ‚Äúno loss of quality‚Äù is meant that visually original and optimized images will not differ in any way.  I read quite a few articles on Habr√© devoted to this issue, but I‚Äôll say, most of it is complete nonsense, they state facts and not reasons.  This review focuses on people who have a basic understanding of image optimization. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  PNG </h4><br>  And so, how is the optimization going?  Let's take a look at the order, mainly due to several reasons, and now we will consider them. <br><br><h5>  Non-interlaced or Interlaced </h5><br>  There are two methods for displaying images in the browser at startup: <br><ul><li>  Non-interlaced - browsers download them sequentially, top to bottom, as information arrives from the network. </li><li>  Interlaced - until the file is fully downloaded, the image in the browser is displayed in low resolution.  those.  first you will see a low-quality image, then, as graphic information becomes available, the image quality will gradually improve.  Interlaced display allows you to reduce the subjective loading time and show users that the image is loaded, but interlaced display also increases the file size. </li></ul>  In conclusion, I will give a couple of links, where the ways of displaying images in the browser when loading are discussed in more detail. <br><br><h5>  ColorType and BitDepth </h5><br>  ColorType is needed to optimize the number of colors in an image.  According to this criterion, the following PNG formats are available: <br><ol><li>  Grayscale; </li><li>  Grayscale + alpha; </li><li>  Palette (256 colors); </li><li>  RGB; </li><li>  RGB + alpha. </li></ol>  Technology ColorType just chooses the format in which the image will weigh the least, but visually does not change.  Here is an example of the work of this technology (to be honest, the images were optimized using the same algorithm):

      PNG RGB + alpha - 17,853 bytes <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5fa/e5e/577/5fae5e5771960e2b972c07b18f575fb7.png" alt="image"><br><br>  PNG Palette - 13,446 bytes <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e32/daf/6eb/e32daf6eba87e4b4c3fad0eb10844724.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The difference in size is 4407 bytes (24%), while the visual images have not changed.  If you see a different image, then this is an optical illusion. <br><br>  BitDepth - bit depth, there are two types: <br><ol><li>  1-bit; </li><li>  2-bit; </li><li>  4-bit; </li><li>  8-bit; </li><li>  16-bit. </li></ol>  BitDepth technology is similar to ColorType. <br>  Here is an example of the work of this technology (to be honest, the images were optimized using the same algorithm): <br><br>  PNG 4-bit - 6 253 bytes <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/8b/67/8b67101169ed125075daa671ad2e18e5.png" alt="image"><br><br>  PNG 8-bit - 5,921 bytes <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/c7/c4/c7c4cb286b420499eea2dd65355f64fd.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The difference in size is 332 bytes (5.3%), while the visual images did not change.  If you see a different image, then this is an optical illusion. <br><br>  Both technologies support almost all image editors that can save in PNG, but few people know about it, and for this reason, developers of PNG optimizers have to take care of it. <br><br><h5>  Chunks </h5><br>  If someone <s>in the tank</s> does not know, PNG consists of <a href="http://libpng.org/pub/png/spec/1.2/PNG-Chunks.html">Chunks</a> .  Write what it is Chunks will not, you can read.  I'd better show, for this there is a program - <a href="http://entropymine.com/jason/tweakpng/">TweakPNG</a> , take any image of the PNG format and open through this program and see the whole structure of the PNG. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1af/cfb/bca/1afcfbbca05cc6e98f4cf6a1d275db5f.png" alt="image"><br><br>  There are programs like TweakPNG, but it is the best and most convenient.  I will tell you about the rest of the programs in conclusion. <br><br>  As can be seen from the above figure, there are two types of Chunk (Attributes column): <br><ul><li>  Critical chunks are present in any PNG image ( <a href="http://libpng.org/pub/png/spec/1.2/PNG-Chunks.html">IHDR</a> , <a href="http://libpng.org/pub/png/spec/1.2/PNG-Chunks.html">PLTE</a> for PNG Palette, one or more <a href="http://libpng.org/pub/png/spec/1.2/PNG-Chunks.html">IDAT</a> and <a href="http://libpng.org/pub/png/spec/1.2/PNG-Chunks.html">IEND</a> ). </li><li>  Ancillary chunks are additional chunks, removing one or another chunks allows you to reduce the size of the image, but not by much. </li></ul><h5>  Palette optimization </h5><br>  Can only be implemented in PNG Palette, a technology based on optimizing <a href="http://libpng.org/pub/png/spec/1.2/PNG-Chunks.html">PLTE</a> chunks, can reduce image size, although not by much.  In my opinion, this technology is better implemented in <a href="http://x128.ho.ua/color-quantizer.html">Color Quantizer</a> , one of its algorithms was implemented in <a href="http://x128.ho.ua/pngutils.html">TruePNG</a> . <br><br><h5>  Alpha channel optimization </h5><br>  I learned about this technology from Sergey Chikuenok ( <a href="http://www.artlebedev.ru/tools/technogrette/img/png-3/">About PNG. Part 3</a> ).  Now this technology is developed, and very much is used and gives a significant increase in optimization.  The main disadvantage is that the technology introduces changes in the image itself (in the Chunks IDAT), and not in the structure, however, the image will not change visually.  I can give an example of two programs: <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://x128.ho.ua/pngutils.html">TruePNG</a> by Color Quantizer; </li><li>  <a href="http://frdx.free.fr/cryopng/">CryoPNG</a> is a more advanced optimization technology and requires more time, can increase the degree of compression. </li></ul>  I understand, it‚Äôs hard to understand what I‚Äôm writing about, I‚Äôll better show an example (to be honest, the images were optimized using the same algorithm, the first image with the alpha channel, the other without the alpha channel). <br><br>  Original image.  The size is 214,903 bytes. <br><br><img src="http://xmages.net/storage/10/1/0/0/3/upload/bb5496b2.png" alt="image"><br><img src="http://xmages.net/storage/10/1/0/9/1/upload/6e433853.png" alt="image"><br><br>  CryoPNG (-f0 option).  The size is 107,806 bytes. <br><br><img src="http://xmages.net/storage/10/1/0/f/a/upload/9d1b1c4f.png" alt="image"><br><img src="http://xmages.net/storage/10/1/0/2/e/upload/ec4ec6bd.png" alt="image"><br><br>  CryoPNG (-f1 option).  The size is 105 625 bytes. <br><br><img src="http://xmages.net/storage/10/1/0/f/2/upload/9dea010b.png" alt="image"><br><img src="http://xmages.net/storage/10/1/0/c/b/upload/4c89a2ca.png" alt="image"><br><br>  CryoPNG (-f2 option).  The size is 107,743 bytes. <br><br><img src="http://xmages.net/storage/10/1/0/b/4/upload/5fa2ebb9.png" alt="image"><br><img src="http://xmages.net/storage/10/1/0/6/2/upload/e25ccda2.png" alt="image"><br><br>  CryoPNG (-f3 option).  The size is 114,604 bytes. <br><br><img src="http://xmages.net/storage/10/1/0/4/9/upload/ee9a3e98.png" alt="image"><br><img src="http://xmages.net/storage/10/1/0/3/a/upload/8dfd0368.png" alt="image"><br><br>  CryoPNG (-f4 option).  The size is 109,053 bytes. <br><br><img src="http://xmages.net/storage/10/1/0/e/1/upload/0275f1d7.png" alt="image"><br><img src="http://xmages.net/storage/10/1/0/3/e/upload/d3a03700.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The disadvantage of CryoPNG is that optimization of all five images is required to identify the best result, and this in turn requires a lot of time. <br>  TruePNG works in this regard, similarly to CryoPNG -f0, in turn, CryoPNG -f0 is optimal in terms of PNG optimization (as they say, this is just an experience).  According to my observations, CryoPNG -f1 and CryoPNG -f4 are much more likely to optimize PNG better than CryoPNG -f0, compared to CryoPNG -f2 and CryoPNG -f3. <br><br><h5>  Deflate compression algorithm + String filtering </h5><br>  As we said, PNG consists of Chunks, in this case, we are interested in Chunks - IDAT.  For its compression, two factors mainly play, the string filtering and the Deflate compression algorithm.  Let's talk about this in more detail. <br><br><h6>  String filtering </h6><br>  <a href="http://libpng.org/pub/png/spec/1.2/PNG-Filters.html">Filters</a> that are used in PNG are needed to prepare the data for compression and thus increase its degree.  The filter processes each line in such a way that it is not the byte values ‚Äã‚Äãthemselves that have to be encoded, but the difference between the current and the previous one.  From the filter depends on what is considered the previous one. <br><ol><li>  None - no filter; </li><li>  Sub looks for bytes in the same line; </li><li>  Up - with the same number as the current one in the previous one; </li><li>  Average takes both and calculates arithmetic average from them; </li><li>  Paeth looks at the byte before the byte in the previous line, compares the difference and encodes the smallest. </li></ol>  Generally speaking, there are no specific recommendations on which filter to choose.  For each line, you can choose your own filter, so often they just apply all the filters in a row and look at how compression is best.  There is another filter - Adaptive, - you can say this is a ‚Äúmix‚Äù of filters.  Filters support almost all programs PNG optimizers, but personally I know only two programs that have a more advanced system for creating filters: <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://x128.ho.ua/pngutils.html">TruePNG</a> ; </li><li>  <a href="http://bjoern.hoehrmann.de/pngwolf/">PNGWolf</a> . </li></ul>  <a href="http://advsys.net/ken/utils.htm">PNGOut</a> does not create such filters, but the new version <a href="http://advsys.net/ken/utils.htm">adds</a> support for built-in filters.  This was done at my request. <br><br><h6>  Deflate compression algorithm </h6><br>  Today there are several libraries based on the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deflate">Deflate</a> compression <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deflate">algorithm</a> : <br><table border="1"><tbody><tr><td>  <b>Library</b> <br>  <b>Deflate</b> </td><td>  <b>Speed</b> <br>  <b>work</b> </td><td>  <b>Power</b> <br>  <b>compression</b> </td><td>  <b>Programs</b> </td><td>  <b>Note</b> </td></tr><tr><td>  <a href="http://zlib.net/">Zlib</a> </td><td>  High </td><td>  Low </td><td>  <a href="http://x128.ho.ua/pngutils.html">TruePNG</a> <br>  <a href="http://optipng.sourceforge.net/">OptiPNG</a> <br>  <a href="http://bjoern.hoehrmann.de/pngwolf/">PNGWolf</a> </td><td>  Due to the high speed of work, it can quickly sort out a large number of parameter values ‚Äã‚Äãand select the optimal ones. </td></tr><tr><td>  <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/">7-zip</a> </td><td>  Average </td><td>  Average </td><td>  <a href="http://advancemame.sourceforge.net/comp-readme.html">Adfdef</a> <br>  <a href="http://bjoern.hoehrmann.de/pngwolf/">PNGWolf</a> </td><td rowspan="2">  Not always selected values ‚Äã‚Äãof parameters in Zlib are optimal for them (close to optimal).  The enumeration of parameter values ‚Äã‚Äãwill take a large amount of time and almost always the time spent does not justify the result obtained. </td></tr><tr><td>  <a href="http://advsys.net/ken/utils.htm">Kzip</a> </td><td>  Low </td><td>  High </td><td>  <a href="http://advsys.net/ken/utils.htm">PNGOut</a> </td></tr></tbody></table>  PNGWolf uses both Zlib and 7-zip simultaneously. <br><br>  <i>Important</i> : all these programs complement each other, and they are strong when they are united.  This is the biggest problem when they are used separately, and then compare the results.  First you need to use Zlib, and then 7-zip and / or Kzip. <br><br>  In the next part, we will talk about these programs in more detail, as well as construct three PNG optimization algorithms (taking into account the optimization of the alpha channel) according to the degree of compression and elapsed time.  Below is a conditional graph of the degree of compression versus elapsed time for optimizing IDAT Chunks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d50/dcc/731/d50dcc731a364c3b3572bc9bbe9116ee.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  As can be seen from the graph, the greater the degree of compression, the more time is required. <br><br><h4>  And a bit more... </h4><br>  Here we talk about two programs: <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://encode.ru/threads/1214-defluff-a-deflate-huffman-optimizer">Defluff</a> ; </li><li>  <a href="http://www.walbeehm.com/download/">DeflOpt</a> . </li></ul>  I recommend using them at the very end of PNG optimization and in the order that I wrote above.  They can reduce the size of PNG by several tens of bytes, while the speed of work is very high. <br><br><h4>  Jpeg </h4><br>  So, we turn to JPEG, everything is much simpler, and so on.  But before that, I will say that JPEG cannot be re-saved without losing quality, even with a quality level of 100 (this is not the maximum quality, but the mathematical limit of optimization).  Consider the following example (to be honest, the images were optimized using the same algorithm). <br><br>  The original image is 52,917 bytes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/995/044/895/9950448957dcd28cb88bf15ce134bb33.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  New image (saved via Adobe Photoshop CS5, Save for Web 100) - 53,767 bytes <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4cf/c70/101/4cfc701015c9ca54270a60095c646ad3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  We build diff-difference images. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/11f/6ec/3c2/11f6ec3c2c938ff4319369a916cb2ee3.png" alt="image"><br><br>  This is how the pictures have changed a lot, yes, visually nothing is noticeable.  As you can see the size of the picture has increased.  This is due to the specifics of the library that creates the JPEG, let's talk about the libraries a little later. <br><br>  There is only one program that allows you to resave images in JPEG without losing quality - <a href="http://www.betterjpeg.com/">BetterJPEG</a> (there is a plugin for Adobe Photoshop).  If I am not mistaken, the program is free for residents of CIS countries for non-commercial use.  Personally, I use BetterJPEG when there is no source and minor editing of the image is required.  Consider the example of BetterJPEG. <br><br>  Original image. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dc0/440/d1e/dc0440d1e6ca30f9ae6b207cad95d229.jpg" alt="image"><br>  New image (complicate the situation, add the inscription "HTML"). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7bb/ca1/30c/7bbca130cfda84e955db413fd93eb043.jpg" alt="image"><br>  We build diff-difference images. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c96/d1d/32e/c96d1d32ee9d3c15bb5c8abc97c6c28c.png" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  Markers </h5><br>  JPEG, unlike PNG, consists of markers.  I recommend reading the article <a href="http://www.0x99.ru/Pages/jpeg/content/cnt-05.aspx">‚ÄúFile Structure, Markers‚Äù</a> , I also recommend that you look at the site itself.  The most powerful program for studying the structure of JPEG is <a href="http://www.impulseadventure.com/photo/">JPEGsnoop</a> .  There are more programs, but I will tell you about them in conclusion.  To study the structure of JPEG, I recommend the following image - <a href="http%253A%252F%252Fxmages.net%252Fstorage%252F10%252F1%252F0%252Fb%252Fd%252Fupload%252Fcbbef596.jpg">PhotoME</a> . <br>  Removing some markers (APP0-APP15, COM), can significantly reduce the size of the image.  I like the most for this program - <a href="http://www.sentex.net/~mwandel/jhead/">Jhead</a> , the most simple and convenient. <br><br><h5>  Progressive and Optimized </h5><br>  There are three methods for displaying images in the browser at startup. <br><ul><li>  Standard.  Now almost not used, similar to the optimized method (the compression ratio is worse). </li><li>  Optimized ‚Äî Creates an enhanced JPEG file with a smaller file size.  Browsers download them sequentially, top to bottom, as information arrives from the network. </li><li>  Progressive - the image is displayed as a sequence of overlays, which allows you to display a low-resolution image before it is fully loaded, i.e.  first you will see a low-quality image, then, as graphic information becomes available, the image quality will gradually improve.  Internet Explorer, including the eighth version, does not support progressive JPEG download, it shows it only after a full download of the file, which is very different from the behavior of the "traditional" JPEG when the image is displayed from top to bottom as it downloads. </li></ul>  Read more about this in the article <a href="http://webo.in/articles/habrahabr/73-jpeg-baseline-progressive/">‚ÄúImage Optimization, Part 4: Sequential JPEG - to be or not to be?‚Äù</a> <br><br><h5>  Jpeg library </h5><br>  And here the most interesting begins.  Nobody thought about how to create a jpeg?  It turns out that there are libraries, and there are not so many of them, consider some of them: <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://www.adobe.com/ru/">Adobe</a> uses its own libraries, there are several of them at all, for example, Adobe Photoshop, Save for web - used to save to WEB. </li><li>  <a href="http://www.ijg.org/">LibJPEG</a> .  I use almost all programs that can save to JPEG, including Adobe Fireworks.  The library LibJPEG has a very interesting program - <a href="http://sylvana.net/jpegcrop/jpegtran/">JPEGTran</a> (optimizes the image, without loss of quality).  It makes sense to use if you create JPEG images through Photoshop or Illustrator and optimize via JPEGTran, then you get the maximum optimization effect, because  it turns out that two libraries are used.  Unfortunately, I never managed to force Photoshop to save to JPEG, without losing quality. </li></ul>  Remember, when we resave the image in JPEG, it turned out that the new image is larger than the original.  This is due to the specifics of the libraries.  Here is a small overview of the work of libraries - <a href="http://guro-games.com/articles/2010_04_14_jpg_vs_tiff.htm">Corel Painter vs Adobe Photoshop</a> . <br><br>  Say which of the two libraries optimizes better, the question is very complex and not straightforward, but because of the very high speed of JPEGTran, you just do not notice its work, just do not forget to check the image size, increased or not, all this can be done through bat .  Remember, JPEGTran can transfer JPEG from Progressive to Optimized and vice versa, without changing the picture itself. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  This is of course all the reasons, but the most significant.  I communicated with almost all the authors of the above program, and they are all very talented people.  I wanted to thank <b>x128</b> for the great help in studying image optimization. <br><br>  More information about how to display images in the browser when downloading can be read: <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interlace_%2528bitmaps%2529">Interlacing (bitmaps)</a> ; </li><li>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam7_algorithm">Adam7 algorithm</a> . </li></ul>  To make sure that the above methods really optimize without loss of quality, I suggest to look at how to <a href="http://www.photoshopessentials.com/essentials/jpeg-compression/">create diff-difference images</a> . <br>  For a more complete picture of optimization, I recommend reading the following articles: <br><ol><li>  <a href="http://www.artlebedev.ru/tools/technogrette/img/">Work with images</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2592%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F:%25D0%259F%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25BA_%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580%25D1%2583%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B5">Preparing Images for Download</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.xiper.net/learn/photoshop/optimization-gif-and-png-8.html">GIF and PNG-8 optimization for web</a> </li></ol>  Additionally, the software that I recommend to use when studying the structure of images and not only: <ol><li>  <a href="http://www.photome.de/">PhotoME</a> is a very convenient program for studying the structure of PNG and JPEG, not as powerful as the ones described above, I use it as the main one. </li><li>  <a href="http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/">ExifTool</a> is a very powerful program for studying the structure of PNG and JPEG.  Works through the command line, there is an online version - <a href="http://regex.info/exif.cgi">Jeffrey's Exif Viewer</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.sweetscape.com/010editor/">010 Editor</a> - Hex-editor, but has an add-on ( <a href="">JPEG</a> , <a href="">PNG</a> + <a href="">Chunks</a> ), which helps to study the structure of PNG and JPEG, sometimes simply not replaceable. </li></ol>  In conclusion, I would like to talk about the online image optimization service - <a href="http://www.punypng.com/">PunyPng</a> .  I can not say that he is perfect in terms of optimization, but today he is the best of those whom I have met. <br><br><h4>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/web_design/121096/">To be continued...</a> </h4></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/119009/">https://habr.com/ru/post/119009/</a></p>
