  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Restoring access to Google Analytics in 4 easy steps.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It turned out that a script was installed on one of the sites we developed for collecting statistics from <b>Google Analytics</b> .  However, who registered it and who owns the account, we did not know. <br><br>  A web analyst advised me to create a new tracking ID, but I didn‚Äôt like this approach - losing all the statistics from the day the product was launched seemed unattractive.  I chose a different path. <br><br>  If you do not know which account the Google Analytics code on your site belongs to, if any of the developers do not give access to the analytics or you have lost access to the mailbox that the analytics is configured to, I ask for the cat. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Quick ways but not working </h2><br>  You may be more lucky, but Google forums, groups, as well as writing an email using the support form did nothing.  True, it says that you can wait for about a week.  After several days of silence, I decided that this approach does not work, so I recommend that you immediately proceed to the method described below. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
    <h2>  Proven and working approach </h2><br>  First, you need a google account.  As I understand it, it does not matter whether it belongs to your company or to you personally.  If you do not have one for some reason, ask a friend or colleague to follow the steps below for you. <br><br><h4>  1. Start </h4><br>  Sign in to any of the services, such as Gmail. <br>  Visit <a href="https://support.google.com/adwords/answer/8206">https://support.google.com/adwords/answer/8206</a> <br><br>  Perhaps you will want to write in the chat or use email.  If you want your problem solved quickly, it is better not to use them.  Click on the link, where the arrow in the figure, to get phone support. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/55b/a35/96b/55ba3596b8f64878ad8f93b471cecd5e.png"><br><br><h4>  2. Country selection </h4><br>  On the next page, select your country, and also write down the 10-digit customer ID.  This code, as I understand it, is yours personally and does not change between sessions.  But since you may not be able to reach you from the first time, it is better to keep it somewhere close at hand, and not in a browser, which at the most inopportune moment may hang or fall off. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a92/cd5/b3a/a92cd5b3a4914e7f843c97e460fdf3ca.png"><br><br><h4>  3. Dialing </h4><br>  <i>Before you call, you should make a clarification: despite the fact that you are applying on a question related to Google Analytics, you call AdWords support.</i>  <i>Therefore, if you try to refuse support, insist that the AdWords team supports Analytics.</i>  <i>I was told at the beginning that my problem was not related to their competence.</i> <br><br>  As the previous figure shows, support works during the specified hours on weekdays, so wait for the specified time and call. <br><br>  After you have called, called your customer ID and underwent other security procedures, you will be asked which sites you need to regain access to.  ‚ÄúTracking ID‚Äù was not asked, but you can easily find it in the pages if the code is placed correctly. <br><br><h4>  4. Recovery procedure </h4><br>  Email is sent to you about the following: <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Full text of the letter</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  We contacted the person who has access to manage the users of the account or the Google Analytics UA-11111111-1 resource and asked him to contact you personally. <br><br>  If you don‚Äôt receive a response within two business days, follow these steps to access your Google Analytics account or resource with editing and user management rights: <br><br>  Proof of ownership of Google Analytics web resources <br>  To confirm that you are the owner of every domain that is tracked in your UA-11111111-1 account (ID 11111111), follow these steps: <br><br>  Create and save the text file analytics.txt. <br>  Insert the following line into this file: "---------------. Add the address to your Google Analytics account yourmail@gmail.com with editing or user management rights - date -" <br>  Upload this file to the root directory of each of the domains tracked in your account. <br>  Add "analytics.txt" to the end of the URL.  For example, in the case of ‚Äú <a href="http://www.example.com/">www.example.com</a> ‚Äù, the downloaded file will look like this: <a href="http://www.example.com/analytics.txt">www.example.com/analytics.txt</a> . <br><br>  Next steps <br>  After downloading the analytics.txt file, specify the URL of the downloaded file in response to this email.  After receiving the necessary information, we will give you access to this account or Google Analytics resource with editing and user management rights. <br><br>  We request this information to ensure the safety of users.  Thank you in advance for your assistance! <br></div></div><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1cc/adb/5ef/1ccadb5ef8d24314af48668892f3805e.png"><br><br>  We create and place the file according to the instructions on the pages with the analytics script.  Check that the file is displayed in the browser and send in response to the email link. <br><br>  We are waiting for two days, if the admin is not announced, Google provides access to your legal mailbox. <br><br>  Successful analytics and thanks from Google for excellent support. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/244671/">https://habr.com/ru/post/244671/</a></p>
