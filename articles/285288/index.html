It was possible to see many different examples when the principles of work organization declared by the management of the company are very weakly connected with reality. <br><br>  For example, a charismatic and modern director who seeks to introduce Western orders into companies and constantly invites business gurus to seminars ‚Äî and ludicrous fines of $ 100 for coffee in the workplace ‚Äî and employees escaping from the company after a maximum of 2 years. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  A small company of a graduate of a technical institute, which has become a major system integrator - and accidentally overheard negotiations with partners in the style of "dashing 90", and a PR service writing for the boss all interviews in business publications.

      The office with a huge turnover, engaged in deliveries to the state.  structure - and consists of 10 people, almost do not understand anything in computers and even more so in the server equipment. <br><br>  Sometimes there is a feeling that in our country a human attitude towards employees and informal organization of work is possible only in small start-up companies.  Of course, any developer will want to work at Google by reading an article about Googlplex.  But on the other hand, are all sorts of bonuses important?  Will these factors be decisive when choosing a job, or do I need something else from the employer? <br>  As a matter of fact, these thoughts came to my mind when, while looking at available vacancies, I came across rabota.ru in <a href="http://www.rabota.ru/guide/company/rynok_razrabotchikov.html">an interview with the main HR ‚ÄúRunner‚Äù, Maria Zhukova</a> . <br><br>  Here are some quotes from the interview: <br><br>  <i>Yes, today there are really few specialists in the field of development on the market, one can observe a real shortage - the number of posted vacancies from IT companies significantly exceeds the number of applicants, and at times.</i>  <i>Technologies are actively developing, companies are growing, and there are mostly the same developers on the market.</i>  <i>At the same time, experienced specialists often change jobs not through employment sites, but through personal contacts.</i> <br><br>  About the shortage of developers has already been mentioned many times, but isn't this deficiency a consequence of the lack of a normal labor market and mobility traditions?  Many companies consider employees to be almost their own property, managers have a negative attitude towards headhunting.  So it turns out that a new job is being searched for in a quiet place, so that God forbid the chief did not recognize. <br><br>  <i>Companies are also actively expanding the proposed working conditions, and this is no longer just a social package, but dinners at work, recreation areas, etc.</i>  <i>We also highlight the ‚Äúclub‚Äù (as we call it) approach, where freedom in work, the absence of an explicit hierarchy, collegiality in work create a unique atmosphere, through which work becomes for an employee not just work, but part of his life.</i>  <i>This approach can be observed in companies of different industries, but most of all it is important for high-tech employers.</i> <br><br>  Just those buns, which I mentioned above.  The social package is, of course, good.  Recreation areas are a more controversial issue in terms of their own productivity: as far as I can remember from the post about the Runner‚Äôs office, they have game consoles, ping-pong and so on.  Would this not be a significant distraction from work?  Or do we a priori believe that the worker is responsible enough not to cut himself in Halo at the height of the working day? <br><br>  <i>Also important is the possibility of not only vertical, but also horizontal growth - the opportunity to work on solving other problems, moving within the direction.</i>  <i>This moment, by the way, plays a key role in situations of saturation and the so-called ‚Äúburnout‚Äù of a specialist, when he has lost interest in the project or wants to change the scope of activity.</i>  <i>If a company practices such horizontal permutations, allows employees to try themselves in a new capacity, this makes them mobile and more attractive.</i> <br><br>  Probably, here you can add the rule of Google about 80% and 20% of working time.  Not always an obvious advantage, although at one of the places of work I took advantage of them.  On the other hand, really, what to do if an employee doesn‚Äôt fit the role in which he decided to try himself?  And what if he wants to change it again? <br><br>  <i>The openness and accessibility of the leadership also plays a serious role: there should not be transcendental stars in the company with a secretary in the reception room that is difficult to reach.</i>  <i>We are building a company horizontally, thanks to which every employee can communicate with management on an equal footing and, if desired, influence the processes that take place in the company.</i> <br><br>  The openness and accessibility of management is very healthy, but, as it seems to me, the larger the company, the harder it is to really stick to openness, and not just show it.  Although, perhaps, even the sincere desire of management to communicate with employees is worth a lot. <br><br>  <i>In general, freedom - not only at work, but also in self-expression at work - is very important.</i>  <i>You should not drive employees into tough working frames, impose a special form of clothing on them, force them to come strictly at a certain time.</i> <br><br>  Here I agree with this 100%.  I owl and come to work before 10 am for me is very, very problematic.  Not to mention shirts with ties and other dress code. <br><br>  In general, of course, it is nice to see that our large Internet companies create conditions for their employees so that specialists go to work with pleasure.  Working in such a team is much more interesting (and in the case of deals of the Google-Runner scale, and much more promising).  But the question remains: <br>  What factors are decisive for you when choosing a job, and what can make you choose an employer who practices strict, ‚Äúclassical‚Äù methods of work organization? <br><br>  UPDATE: So, according to the results of comments: <br><br>  1. On Habr√©, there are more larks than owls, but a floating work schedule is important in both. <br>  2. The employer must comply with the Labor Code <br>  3. The boss and subordinates are partners, ‚ÄúI am the boss ‚Äî you are a fool, you are the boss ‚Äî I am a fool‚Äù in the scoop. <br>  4. Soc.  The package is not the most important component, as its quality is often quite doubtful, good soc.  the package is definitely a plus <br>  5. Comfortable workplace, the availability of all necessary equipment - we are geeks, in the end :) <br>  6. You can not do something quality in the clothes in which you feel not comfortable.  Dress code - no big <br>  7. Catering - yes rather than no, the main thing is that it is diverse.  Kitchen in the office is a big plus. <br>  8. Sports area (darts, horizontal bar, other "light" warm-up options, without fanaticism) - very useful for our sedentary work <br>  9. It seems that ‚ÄúRunner‚Äù is almost perfect as a place of work for developers :) <br>  10. Nobody wants to be an office plankton, no matter how big the company‚Äôs name is and what prospects would open up after a couple of years of working there. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/285288/">https://habr.com/ru/post/285288/</a></p>
