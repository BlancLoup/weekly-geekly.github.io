Once we have already raised this topic and listed <a href="https://habr.com/company/everydaytools/blog/325272/">seven useful methods</a> that help to stay in good shape and systematically deal with affairs.  And everything is good, but only in order to properly introduce them into your life, again, you must first overcome laziness - buy diaries and calendars, calculate something, monitor something. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lb/wu/at/lbwuath-gxuxf9igr5xveft-tfu.jpeg"></div><br><br>  Fortunately, there is a twenty first century in the courtyard and for any occasion in life there is somewhere some miracle of technology that is ready to take at least some of the work on itself.  This also applies to anti-procrastination techniques.  Under the cut, we have collected a list of decisions that have accumulated this year, which are either based on the methods we considered, or combine well with them - in a word, they can help in the difficult task of self-organization.

      A simple and harsh solution for the ‚Äúswallow a frog‚Äù school, which is procrastinating in the best traditions of the school.  The application offers to make a list of urgent matters and delete them as they are completed.  Everything seems to be standard, but there is one ‚Äúbut‚Äù: as the service honestly warns, the added tasks will be automatically deleted after exactly 24 hours.  So - now or never.  Information on completed and outstanding cases for the last week is stored in the profile, giving an opportunity to assess post-factum with a sense of shame and remorse. <br><br>  <b><a href="https://www.tryeffortless.com/">Effortless</a></b> <br><br>  A similar idea with Gone, but in a much softer implementation.  Effortless offers you a set of simple text timers that can be attached to the top panel of the screen.  You yourself estimate the duration of a task and click on the ‚ÄúStart‚Äù, after which the system starts counting down.  The effect of time trouble also works here, only the focus is not on the threat of severe consequences, but on a permanent, rigorous reminder of the time flowing out.  If several tasks are given, the service allows you to suspend them and change the order;  in case the user does not fit in any way, a saving button ‚ÄúAdd five minutes‚Äù is provided.  This method is difficult to attribute to a particular technique, but it can work well in tandem with the flowtime to determine or adjust the length of the sessions. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/a0/y1/ei/a0y1ei5wo5-qneczefeggr1ph8q.png"></div><br><br>  <b><a href="http://youjustneedspace.com/">Space</a></b> <br><br>  Of course, the best way to do everything and achieve more is to forever abandon Facebook / Reddit / Habr / Twitter / another virtual black hole, but who are we kidding.  The creators of the Space service think soberly: they tend not to make you quit, but only to reduce the dose a little.  This is done simply - at some moments of your stay on the specified site or in the application, the screen is briefly blocked, inviting you to take a break and take a couple of breaths.  It should be noted that the system chooses these moments on its own and not even randomly: the frequency of interruptions is determined on the basis of the same neurological data, which are usually used to hook people on applications.  In fact, it is a kind of Pomodoro inside out - just as continuous activity helps to enter the flow state, a forced stop allows one to get out of it.  The choice is entirely yours: the service does not close anything by force or even give out reproachful messages, only takes the result into account in its algorithm. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://instantapp.today/producthunt-4/">Instant</a></b> <br><br>  If you are ready to face it, the Instant application will gladly provide you with a Google Analytics report on how your life is going.  At the moment, data is collected on: use of the phone and specific applications, sleep, movement from location to location and physical activity (for those who have the appropriate devices).  On the basis of this data, nice graphs and charts are compiled, average values ‚Äã‚Äãare calculated and trends and patterns are tracked.  You get results not only in the form of reports, but also short messages with deserving, according to the system, attention excerpts that can motivate you.  For those who adhere to the system "should, should, I want," such information will be useful. <br><br>  <b><a href="https://butleroy.com/">Butleroy</a></b> <br><br>  Congratulations, you now have a personal robot butler, his name is Roy.  He does not mix a cocktail for you, but he completely undertakes the organization of leisure and small obligations.  The application is convenient in that it can build the schedule independently based on the most approximate data, like ‚Äútwice a week in the evenings‚Äù or ‚Äúon any weekday until the end of the month‚Äù - you do not even need to specify specific dates.  If you make plans with other employers of Roy, he will not forget to compare your schedules in order to choose the optimal time that will suit everyone.  So far, the algorithm takes into account only factors such as time and priority, but in the future, the creators intend to include additional criteria - for example, the weather for outdoor entertainment.  This is also a good help for those who practice the ‚Äúshould, should, I want‚Äù approach, although there is a certain danger in automating the process - it is, of course, faster and lazier, but it cannot give the same fine balance of goals and internal needs as the distribution of tasks manually. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zy/kz/ui/zykzuisi0l0_6s63vbiqf3cqjaq.png"></div><br><br>  <b><a href="https://www.forestapp.cc/en/">Forest</a></b> <br><br>  It‚Äôs not hard to get distracted when you have a dozen games in your pocket, friends and the entire world wide web ping along different channels at once.  Forest is designed for those who too often reaches for the phone.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe application is transparent - for a long stay in the application, where nothing can be done except to admire the pleasant green design, you are rewarded, you are punished for trying to switch to others.  The reward is capricious trees, which grow and get stronger the stronger, the more time you spend with them (or, in other words, away from other mobile entertainment).  If you remember the ‚Äúdon't interrupt the chain‚Äù technique, you can easily recognize its gamified derivative here: when you have already grown a forest, it's a shame to cross your own efforts. <br><br>  <b><a href="https://www.noisli.com/">Noisli</a></b> <br><br>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating a suitable auditory atmosphere for productivity is also gradually gaining popularity.  Unlike focus @ will, this application suggests using sounds of nature to focus attention.  It turns out that they can not only relax.  The service has a collection of noises, which, according to the developers, focus, but do not over-attract attention.  You can experiment with options from different categories, create playlists and combinations, and even try to connect at the same time and other techniques - for example, the notorious timer for Pomodoro. <br><br>  To complete this list would probably be worth a warning that the main component of any methodology is the desire to change something in life and no application will do this for you.  But we‚Äôll go smarter and end it with a standard invitation to share our findings in the comments - suddenly, there‚Äôs still an automatic motivation generator, which we don‚Äôt know about. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/358358/">https://habr.com/ru/post/358358/</a></p>
