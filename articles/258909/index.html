  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Customer questions in the negotiations on the development of mobile applications</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good afternoon friends! <br><br>  In this small article I want to share the experience of negotiating the sale of services of a mobile application development studio.  I ask to take the text and statement as personal experience and ‚Äúone story‚Äù.  Material like ‚Äúhow to sell‚Äù or ‚Äúhow to negotiate‚Äù you will not find here. <br><br>  So, below I will talk about the negotiation process with the customer company for the development of a mobile application. 
      <br>

In the appendix TK on 99 pages. <br><br>  Subsequent communication with a representative of a fairly large customer company suggested that the guys are serious and at this stage they are trying to select the list of developers.  The server part is already ready and works, it requires an ios application by a certain time. <br><br>  He called the price and terms, laying a stock for some risks and dark places in the TC.  A couple of days later I received an invitation to meet: I passed with my proposal into a certain short list of applicants. <br><br>  At this stage, I studied the history of the company, read a lot of publications in the press.  He met in absentia with the founders and googled data about those with whom he had to communicate.  I must say that I liked the company.  I thought it would be interesting to work on their application and create something really interesting and worthy. <br><br><h5>  <b>Negotiation Day</b> </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a44/23a/d85/a4423ad858694e8090b6c54e6d722cec.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Fresh business center in the center, a couple of floors under the "office", reception, leather furniture, poppies on the tables and other attributes of the "modern successful company."  I get acquainted with the correspondence interlocutor and we pass into the negotiation room. <br>  Exchange of business cards, we introduce ourselves.  The guys have a conversation plan and a list of questions.  I am sure that each customer has his own questions, but something must be repeated. <br><br><h6>  <b>Further dry list of questions in the course of the conversation</b> </h6><br>  1) They said that my proposal for the price was the lowest.  Moreover, much lower than others.  The question is why? <br>  2) What you need to get started? <br>  3) What is the structure of my company? <br>  4) How will the interaction between "you and us"? <br>  5) How will we behave if we realize that we do not have time? <br>  6) How long have we been on the market and what have we achieved, the experience of similar work. <br>  7) Preparing for the publication of the application. <br>  8) Discussed issues on TK. <br>  9) They asked for my experience in billing integration and asked for advice on choosing an operator. <br>  10) Payment, contract, payments. <br>  11) Warranty completion on time? <br>  12) My recommendations on metrics and analytics systems. <br><br>  At the very beginning, answering the first question, I tried to appeal not only to those at the table, but also to the owner, who, as it were, sat aside and went about his business.  To which he said to me: ‚ÄúI don't care who will do it, just to be on time.  Do not pay attention to me.  Thus, their main interest was formed: ‚Äúwho will do on time?‚Äù.  Neither the price, nor the quality, nor anything else of the negotiators were not as interested as blind guarantees to meet the deadline.  As it turned out during the conversation, the customer, speaking of deadlines, meant not just to finish the development, but to release the product to the market.  And about the fact that the release date can only be guaranteed by laying a good month with a plus, I told for the first time to my surprised interlocutors. <br><br>  In general, these are the questions that customers can ask the developer of mobile applications.  I understood that there was a task to manage to such a date at any cost.  Based on this, and built a conversation.  I didn‚Äôt hide my doubts about the expected dates, which I was refused by mail after a couple of hours. <br><br>  I hope that this list can be useful to someone during the preparation for the negotiations. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/258909/">https://habr.com/ru/post/258909/</a></p>
