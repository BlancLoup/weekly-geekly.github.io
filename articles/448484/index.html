  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Aboriginal microbes</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Since 2007, my fate is connected with microbes: for 13 years now they have not let me go.  In my opinion, it is much more than 10,000 hours - something around 30,000. As with any area of ‚Äã‚Äãknowledge, at some point the brain begins to pop up new ideas.  I want to tell about one of them. <br><br>  The word indibiome appeared in my head.  The Russian sonorous analogue of this term, ‚Äúroot microbes‚Äù, is found seven times by Google, with three references to the websites and texts I created.  I like the English analogue of this word more.  Indibiome is derived from the indigenous microbiome (by analogy with indigenous people).  I first encountered indigenous people several years ago, shooting a documentary film about reindeer herders.  Indigenous peoples and indigenous microbes have not been released since then. <br><br>  The term indibiome issued by Google occurs 396 times.  Surely there are words invented by someone or terms with the same statistics.  At first glance it seems that indibiome is just a rare word.  If you study search engine results, you may find that this word is used in one Italian book ( <a href="https://books.google.ru/books%3Fid%3D4_NVAAAAYAAJ%26pg%3DPA385%26lpg%3DPA385%26dq%3Dindibiome%26source%3Dbl%26ots%3D5OUNFSUKxJ%26sig%3DACfU3U3mmsUekuYObFsrDlEL9JbKIk4z5w%26hl%3Dru%26sa%3DX%26ved%3D2ahUKEwjHpJ7ZlMnhAhUC66QKHbAcCxQ4FBDoATACegQICRAB">Lodovico Antonio Muratori, Filippo Argelati - 1723 - Italy</a> ).  However, if you look closely, it becomes clear that in a scanned copy of Google books is wrong.  On the same page, the letter b looks different in other words.  The remaining 395 references contain a few erroneous readings by Google, but for the most part, publications are generated by one author.

      This word has both meaning and several meanings.  Everyone can come up with words, but if they do not adapt to the language and do not show different facets of meaning depending on the environment, then they are useless for expressing thoughts.  Indibiome has several meanings, the word even claims to be a separate philosophy, lifestyle, way of human behavior. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The first meaning of indibiome is the primordial microbes.  Microbes live in the human body, and over the past hundred years their profile has changed quite a lot, very many types of microbes have most likely disappeared from the human body.  Often, their place is taken by other microbes, including those of industrial origin, including probiotic strains.  Company <a href="https://www.chr-hansen.com/en/media/2019/1/chr-hansen-ranked-as-the-most-sustainable-company-in-the-world">Chr.</a>  <a href="https://www.chr-hansen.com/en/media/2019/1/chr-hansen-ranked-as-the-most-sustainable-company-in-the-world">Hansen</a> , for example, produces several hundred thousand strains for the food industry: to create cheeses, starters, kefirs, yoghurts, etc.  In such a situation, it is logical to compare what microbial composition was before, before the violation (indibiome), and what it has become now.  Representatives of the new science of microbial communities (microbiomes) are leading this discussion quite actively. <br><br>  The second meaning of indibiome arises when it comes to microbes characteristic of a particular habitat.  In scientific literature, this meaning is quite common (see the list of links at the bottom of the text), indibiome transfers the microbial identity to the ecosystem: indigenous gut biome, indigenous microbiome of plant.  Here everything seems to be clear with meaning. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b39/af2/c50/b39af2c500cfe8558652bac78b40c277.jpg" alt="image" width="555"></div>  The third meaning is associated with the microbes of indigenous peoples.  In fact, the phrase indigenous people microbiome ( <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar%3Fhl%3Dru%26as_sdt%3D0%252C5%26q%3Dindigenous%2Bpeople%2Bmicrobiome%26btnG%3D">link</a> to google scholar) dropped the word people.  This meaning correlates to some extent with the meaning of the "original".  Scientists are studying the microbes of indigenous people to understand how we all looked in the west before the advent of preservatives and antibiotics - perhaps the main drivers of microbial composition in human civilization over the past 100 years.  My own observations in this area began to take shape during the expedition to Yamal with the team of the documentary ‚ÄúWar of the Worlds.  Bacteria "for Channel One ( <a href="https://www.1tv.ru/doc/pro-nauku/bakterii-voyna-mirov-dokumentalnyy-film">link</a> ).  The skin and intestines of wild people looked very healthy, which surprised me.  Perhaps the understanding of this phenomenon was laid precisely then. <br><br>  "Native microbes" are associated with health.  It is important to note that this article has no goal to postulate: indibiome is the only health option.  The text is rather a reflection, a hypothesis, a sum of facts and, most importantly, an invitation to a discussion.  Below I will give 13 arguments in favor of the importance of "indigenous microbes." <br><br><h3>  Argument "The emergence of life" </h3><br>  Two billion years ago, the planet to which we were so accustomed looked different.  The continents were flat, and the oceans infested with cyanobacteria were dark brown.  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D1%258B">Stromatolites</a> built by these bacteria in shallow water, released oxygen and saturated them with the atmosphere. <br><br>  The color of the sky began to change in the direction of blue only 2 billion years ago, after the atmosphere was saturated with oxygen.  No doubt, bacteria gave life to plants, animals and fungi.  With a low probability, since any bacterium was obtained from one of those that lived billions of years ago, in bacteria you can find molecules that have been in the same form for billions of years.  For amino acids or nucleic acids, it seems possible.  It is very important to feel this moment: no, not the presence of an ancient molecule, but the fact that all life came from bacteria. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/27c/6b5/9fe/27c6b59fe51d5bbb9c9e2c2608ceb694.png" alt="image" width="555"></div><br><h3>  Argument "Evolution of digestion and bacteria" </h3><br>  Most of all bacteria like when it is dark, damp and a lot of food.  The intestines of 7 billion people carry 700 billion trillion bacteria or 700 <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD">sextillions of</a> bacteria.  Starting from the very first intestine, most likely, the first fossil that was not previously known to us - <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2594%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8">Dickensonia</a> 600 million years ago, bacteria were supposed to live in the intestine.  Further, the immune system was supposed to appear as a means of controlling the composition of bacteria.  And finally, the organs of perception and the brain appeared as appendages of the intestine, ensuring its survival and reproduction.  Improving with each new species, bacteria learned to live with new and new organisms.  And although, theoretically, dinosaur lactobacillus can take root in our gut, our ‚Äúroot‚Äù has traveled a significant evolutionary distance, which can be seen in its DNA. <br><br>  Feel this thesis: indibiome - the peak of the evolution of the microbial community for each species with its habitat and digestive system.  Interestingly, these communities are open and share with each other.  Describing or calculating such a complex community dynamics is not yet real. <br><br><h3>  Argument "Plants, food and bacteria" </h3><br>  This argument is very simple.  In the human body there is a limited number of enzymes, and the number of variations in chemical modifications of the fibers of plant walls is infinite.  Even with the nonspecific activity of enzymes, it is difficult to imagine that among the 30,000 genes in our DNA there are all the necessary enzymes for the decomposition of fibers.  And this is not necessary when there are trillions of bacteria in the intestines: let them learn, adapt to all new and new fibers.  It is clear that evolution made a choice in the direction of such a symbiosis.  Man extracts fiber, and bacteria digest them.  Moreover, a bacterium lives in every plant in nature, which easily digests it in the correct conditions of temperature and pH.  Indigenous lactobacilli can be isolated from any green leaf.  By the way, fermentation is based on this. <br><br><h3>  The argument "Inflammation as the basis of diseases" </h3><br>  The immune system can think of a small number of things.  The immune system thinks about the intestines.  If there is not everything ok, then she is busy with just that and nothing else can distract her.  It is easier to remove inflammation and then help it fight, for example, cancer, which is being done now in the framework of advanced research on cancer immunotherapy technology.  ( <a href="https://www.cell.com/cancer-cell/abstract/S1535-6108(18)30120-X">link</a> ).  There is a lot of material requested by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar%3Fhl%3Dru%26as_sdt%3D0%252C5%26q%3Dmicrobiome%2Binflammation%2Bdiabetes%26btnG%3D">‚Äúmicrobiome inflammation diabetes‚Äù</a> or ‚Äú <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar%3Fhl%3Dru%26as_sdt%3D0%252C5%26q%3Dmicrobiome%2Binflammation%2Bobesity%26btnG%3D">microbiome inflammation obesity</a> ‚Äù.  It is believed that one of the reasons is a violation of the original microbiome (indibiome again with us). <br><br><h3>  The argument "Bacteria in art (Science Art)" </h3><br>  Visually, the bacteria are very attractive.  Microbial substance (bacteria and mold) becomes an object of art.  I will cite only references to artists whom I know personally. <br>  <a href="https://www.wolfgangganter.de/works/bactereality">https://www.wolfgangganter.de/works/bactereality</a> <a href="https://www.wolfgangganter.de/works/bactereality"><br></a>  - the project of Wolfgang Gunther, who takes old gelatinous films and grows bacteria on them, which consume the gelatin, make the picture ‚Äúflow‚Äù and leave the patterns. <br>  The second artist from Russia is Daria Fedorova, she grows universes on the cups of incredible colors.  ( <a href="https://www.the-village.ru/village/people/experience/285148-bakterii">link</a> to The Village). <br><br>  And, of course, <a href="http://nastyavarlamova.com/">Nastya Valamova</a> with prints for the collection of <a href="https://www.nnedre.com/">Nelly Nedre</a> clothes. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1a2/336/59f/1a233659f6f8c709b4fe2fa337dea3b2.png" alt="image" width="555"></div><br>  By searching bacterial art in Google even more pictures. <br><br><h3>  The cancer, organ transplant and microbiome argument </h3><br>  An interesting use of the microbiome in modern clinics is not to prevent cancer (as yet), but to restore human health between courses of chemotherapy.  At least 20% of patients suffer from side effects on digestion (mucositis, colitis, diarrhea).  During bone marrow transplantation, it is necessary to completely suppress the entire microflora until the donor brain begins to produce its immune cells.  And if you take germs before transplantation and then return them to the body, then this type of microbiota transplantation is called <a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/fecal-microbiota-transplantation-helps-restore-beneficial-bacteria-cancer-patients">autologous</a> . <br><br><h3>  The argument "Career in microbial research" </h3><br>  There are 427 positions on the international job posting site with the word microbiome ( <a href="https://www.indeed.com/q-Microbiome-jobs.html">link</a> ), 522 linked-in positions ( <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/microbiome-jobs">link</a> ).  This is a dynamic, a new profession is emerging, and the White House (USA) has created a microbiome research support <a href="http://themicrobiome.com/en/about/more/nmi-national-microbiome-initiative-the-white-house">program</a> in which money is spent on creating tools and new jobs, the amount of $ 500 million consists of government money ($ 100 million) and private funds and companies . <br><br><h3>  Argument "Technology of healthy and healthy food production" </h3><br>  <a href="https://www.cell.com/trends/immunology/fulltext/S1471-4906(04)00311-4">Fermentation</a> , as one of the directions for the development of immunology, is now experiencing a boom, since, along with properly ‚Äúdigested‚Äù food, beneficial types of bacteria enter the body, most often it is bifidus and lacto.  Bacteria are used to preserve and preserve products without preservatives.  Companies are wondering if microbes can help feed the planet ( <a href="https://www.chr-hansen.com/en/sustainability/innovating-for-a-sustainable-future/can-plant-microbes-help-feed-the-world">link to video</a> ). <br><br><h3>  The argument "The history of health of one person and his microbes" </h3><br>  Since childhood, I have often been treated with antibiotics.  The last operation on the knee, along with the triathlete metabolism, led to an increase in body weight from 75 to 92 kg.  A body weight of 92 kg with an increase in 176 gives a BMI = 29.7 ( <a href="https://calcus.ru/calculator-imt">here</a> you can count your own), with an obesity border of BMI = 30. For 11 months I experienced a keto diet, fasting 4 days dry, an increase in fiber rations from 15 grams.  up to 50 grams, feces transplantation, poison <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323689.php">Kambo</a> frog and almost all popular probiotics (4-5 species) in the UK I will be glad to devote a separate article to this, there are microbiota analyzes, photos, measurements, video materials and recordings of CGMS .  Now my weight is 67.7 kg.  Overweight is gone as a result of microbiota recovery and reduction of inflammation. <br><br><h3>  Mind and Microbiome Argument </h3><br>  The enteric nervous system is the major depot of serotonin and dopamine.  Although the molecules themselves do not pass the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2593%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE-%25D1%258D%25D0%25BD%25D1%2586%25D0%25B5%25D1%2584%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D1%258C%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580">hemato-encephalic</a> barrier, their precursors, produced in abundance by the microbiome, pass.  Perhaps representatives of indibiome are responsible for happiness.  A microbial transplant helps with autism ( <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2019-04-autism-symptoms-percent-years-fecal.html">link</a> ). <br><br><h3>  Argument "Microbiome of the skin, lungs and reproductive system" </h3><br>  The right bacteria on the skin can cure many problems.  As an example, AOBiome's portfolio of clinical trials ( <a href="https://www.aobiome.com/aobiome-therapeutic-pipeline/">reference</a> ), several drugs in the second phase, and the company began by removing the bacterium from the horse and transplanting it on the human skin so that it could not wash and not smell.  Indibiome here refers to our lost flora, most likely this was due to strong detergents: human skin is now populated with conditional pathogens.  Another example: the microbiota of the vagina, which is responsible not only for the health of the woman, but also for the colonization of the intestines of the newborn.  Indibiome is under attack here, more than 20% of women in the developed world and more than 50% in developing countries suffer from bacterial vaginosis, and in half of the cases there are no symptoms like itching or odor, which means there are no complaints and no treatment. <br><br><h3>  Argument "Traditional Practices of the Worlds and the Microbiome" </h3><br>  Indigenous practitioners - from kissing to the use of medical plants - speak of their intuitive knowledge of what is indibiome (again, I will be happy to make a separate article for readers with a review of research and my understanding of interrelationships). <br><br><h3>  The argument "The future of our planet" </h3><br>  If you learn to eat less and get more from food, as well as grow plants sustainably, using soil restoration techniques and organic greenhouses, you will not need to borrow from future generations.  Much less resources can be spent on the creation, transportation and storage of food.  Happy people are happy countries.  There will be no wars.  Only need to find an approach to this indibiome. " <br><br>  I hope these arguments are a good reason for a discussion or a change in nutrition for the better; readers may want to protect and nurture their microbiome.  That was the purpose of the article. <br><br>  Links to scientific publications about indigenous microbiome: <br><br><ul><li>  Schmidt R. et al.
