  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Bought a new computer? Old is also useful</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It so happened that I love programming and computers.  Therefore, each member of my family had one PC.  I have a stationary (Ubuntu), my mother too (Windows XP), and my wife has a laptop (Windows Vista).  There was a task - to organize the Internet for all this technology.  The provider gives it to me via PPTP.  Without thinking twice (and being lazy), I bought ordinary Ethernet network cards, put them on stationary computers and connected all the computers with wires (to be honest, I also bought a WiFi module for my computer, but stupidly could not configure for ubuntu). <br><br>  As time went on, needs grew (especially the need for workplace mobility) and I became the owner of a MacBook Pro laptop.  What to do with the old computer?  Toss out?  It was a pity ... After all, he almost collected it for two years.  And then I decided - will be the server!  I cleaned the computer and re-installed Ubuntu Linux there. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  purpose </h2><br>  I wanted my old computer to be a web (HTTP), file (FTP, SSH, SMB) server.  Against the background I was busy downloading any large files (including from P2P networks).  It was a sound server (to connect speakers to it, and to transmit sound through WiFi). <br><br><h2>  the Internet </h2><br>  At first, I decided to finally deal with the Internet.  After a couple of days on the forums, it was decided to buy a WiFi router D-Link DIR-300.  Since I had to download from P2P networks, I subscribed to an external static IP service from an Internet provider.  And since that computer that is directly connected via PPTP can have this IP, I decided that a PC would be connected to the Internet (of course, there are such things as port forwarding, but I just didn‚Äôt want to bother).

      Setting up the router was not as easy as I thought.  He went to the disc, which officially worked in Windows XP and Windows Vista.  I connected the router to my wife's laptop and spent about an hour, after which I realized that Vista was definitely not supported there.  In XP, I set it up quickly, only the setup was to choose the unique name of the WiFi network and enable stealth mode. <br><br>  Then I had to figure out how to give the Internet to the router.  I remembered DHCP (+ DNS) and NAT.  DNS was simply established by the command: <br><blockquote>  sudo aptitude install bind9 </blockquote><br>  The DHCP server is established with the following command: <br><blockquote>  sudo aptitude install dhcp3-server </blockquote><br>  Its setup was easy - I added the following lines in /etc/dhcp3/dhcpd.conf: <br><blockquote>  subnet 192.168.3.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 { <br>  range 192.168.3.100 192.168.3.150; <br>  option routers 192.168.3.1; <br>  option broadcast-address 192.168.3.255; <br>  default-lease-time 600; <br>  max-lease-time 7200; <br>  } </blockquote><br>  I have a router on the interface eth0, so the start of the DHCP server is done with the dhcpd3 eth0 command, then I realized that all the commands that would often be executed should be done in separate scripts and I got this file structure: <br><br>  <b>/ run</b> <br>  <b>/ run / net</b> - here work with the network <br>  <b>/ run / app</b> - here launch additional services <br>  <b>/ run / bind</b> - here is the file system binding (then I'll tell you) <br><br>  So I got the files: <br>  <b>/run/net/dhcp.sh</b> - start a DHCP server <br>  <b>/run/net/vpn-on.sh</b> - PPTP connection to the Internet <br>  <b>/run/net/vpn-off.sh</b> - disconnecting from the Internet <br>  <b>/run/net/vpn-ensure.sh</b> - internet connection in case of a break, recorded it in cron (system of periodic command execution) as follows: <br><blockquote>  sudo crontab -e </blockquote><br>  An editor opens in which we add the line: <br><blockquote>  * * * * * /run/net/vpn-ensure.sh </blockquote><br>  It remains to implement the routing.  After some online searches, I wrote another script ( <b>/run/net/routes.sh</b> ) with the following contents: <br><blockquote>  #! / bin / sh <br>  iptables -A FORWARD -i ppp0 -o eth0 -s 192.168.3.0/24 -m state --state NEW -j ACCEPT <br>  iptables -A FORWARD -m state --state ESTABLISHED, RELATED -j ACCEPT <br>  iptables -A POSTROUTING -t nat -j MASQUERADE </blockquote><br>  And do not forget to run in the console: <br><blockquote>  sudo -s <br>  echo 1&gt; / proc / sys / net / ipv4 / ip_forward </blockquote><br><br>  Hooray!  There is Internet! <br><br><h2>  Server </h2><br>  Web and file servers were set up with one command: <br><blockquote>  sudo aptitude install apache2 samba openssh-server proftpd </blockquote><br>  I also installed the GUI for them (since I‚Äôm far from professional in configuring these servers): <br><blockquote>  sudo aptitude install gproftpd gsambad </blockquote><br>  And the VNC server to see the remote desktop server from laptops: <br><blockquote>  sudo aptitude install x11vnc </blockquote><br>  In addition to the servers, it was necessary to think over the file structure.  I came to this: <br>  <b>/ share</b> - FTP / SMB root share <br>  <b>/ share / download</b> - all download managers here should upload files <br>  <b>/ share / music</b> <br>  <b>/ share / video</b> <br>  <b>/ share / torents</b> - from here torrent-clients should take torrent-files and start downloading <br>  <b>/ share / second</b> - my second hard drive <br>  <b>/ share / third</b> - my third hard drive <br>  <b>/ share / www</b> - http server root.  Mounted here by the /run/bind/www.sh script (mount --bind / var / www / / share / www /) <br><br><h2>  Download Managers </h2><br>  It turned out to be more difficult.  I needed download managers with a web interface, and there were very few of them.  But some were found: <br><br>  <b>Deluge</b> I just do not have enough words to describe this wonderful torrent-client.  It has everything, including a Web interface (if it hadn‚Äôt been buggy sometimes, it would have been very good). <br>  Put the command: <br><blockquote>  sudo aptitude install deluge </blockquote><br>  Further after start configured via GUI. <br><br>  <b>mldonkey is a</b> powerful but strange multiprotocol project.  I did not like it just a very confusing interface. <br><br><h2>  What happened </h2><br>  An excellent server for personal needs, accessible from the outside (I sometimes take music from work from there :-)). <br>  Convenient downloading from torrent networks (just put the torrent file in a folder on the server and it is automatically downloaded). <br>  TimeMachine (data backup system, included in Mac OS X Leopard) works via WiFi and backs up the data to the server (allocated 80GB to it).  But it was hellishly difficult (even a little disappointed in Apple) - made for <a href="http://blog.xemantic.com/2008/04/timemachine-backups-on-smb-share.html">this article</a> . <br><br><h2>  Unresolved Tasks </h2><br>  Of the outstanding problems left: <br><ul><li>  Sound Server (and Sound Client for MacBook) </li><li>  Download Manager from ed2k networks with web interface </li><li>  Download manager from dc ++ networks with web interface </li><li>  HTTP / FTP download manager with web interface </li></ul><br><h2>  What's next </h2><br>  Now I‚Äôm busy looking for a download manager for HTTP / FTP, but for the first time I sketched a web interface for wget (add download, progress bar, if you're interested - I can put it in sourceforge - work together) <br><br>  <strong>PS</strong> At my place a ‚Äúfriendship of the people‚Äù is obtained :-) Both Windows, and Linux, and Mac OS are presented =) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/37254/">https://habr.com/ru/post/37254/</a></p>
