  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Questions by Leonardo da Vinci</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello! <br><br>  This is the second of three articles on problem analysis and decision-making techniques (the first one is <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/gtd/137377/">here</a> ). <br><br>  Today we will talk about the technique, which is called "Questions by Leonardo da Vinci" and is rather a brainstorming method. <br>  Where does this name come from?  According to unverified information, this method appeared after decoding and analyzing the diaries of a genius, in which a description was found, as well as traces of the repeated use of this method. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

      <br>
      Its main advantage is that it does not require virtually any material resources, and time costs pay off immediately. <br>  With the help of this technique you can analyze anything you want, starting from a piece of code, ending with a book you want to write.  For example, I last used it before drawing up a presentation, the purpose of which was to sell the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãintroducing a certain system for senior staff. <br><br>  There will be no examples in this article for two reasons. <br>  1. The example in the first article was extremely unfortunate. <br>  2. The text would be too cumbersome if I used at least one example (now understand why) <br><br>  All interested in asking under the cat. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  We need a pen and a few sheets of paper. <br><br>  <b>1. Formulate a question, problem or task</b> <br><br>  All the techniques start with this, but here the wording may simply be the object you are working on. <br>  For example: ‚ÄúPresentation of the performance management system‚Äù, ‚ÄúWrite a collection of children's stories‚Äù, ‚ÄúSorting algorithm‚Äù, etc. <br><br>  Write the resulting wording at the top of the first sheet.  Have written?  Go ahead. <br><br>  <b>2. Write 100 questions related to your problem (task, object)</b> <br><br>  100 is not a small number, and at this stage you will have to work hard. <br>  There is one main rule - do not come off.  Turn off anything that might disturb you, stay alone with your thoughts. <br>  After some time, questions will no longer be formulated quickly, but it will still be necessary to add up to one hundred. <br>  You can use 2 simple techniques - "questions in the stream" and "answer-question." <br><br>  The essence of the first (often used by coaches, coaches and negotiators) in one sentence is that each next question ‚Äúclings‚Äù to the previous one. <br><br>  I will give a small chain of questions from my own case with a presentation to illustrate this technique. <br><br>  ‚ÄúFor whom will this presentation be held?‚Äù - ‚ÄúWhat is the experience of using similar systems for these people?‚Äù - ‚ÄúIf it is different, how can it equally effectively handle the demands of people with different experiences?‚Äù - ‚ÄúWhat can I offer people with little experience?‚Äù - "With big?  "... <br><br>  We look carefully at the previous question and try to understand what follows from it and how to put it into the next question. <br><br>  In the process of asking questions, answers to some of them will come to you by themselves - reformulate the answers into new questions (that is, pretend as if the answer was not received).  This method is called the "answer-question". <br><br>  So, after a while you will have 100 recorded questions (maybe more, the main thing is not less).  Is it time to take a break?  No, everything is just beginning. <br><br>  <b>3. Group questions</b> <br><br>  Combine questions within the meaning of 10 groups.  You do not need to rewrite them again; you can simply write their numbers on a separate sheet of paper.  Most likely, it will take you a little more time than the preparation of the questions themselves.  If you get less than 10 groups - do not worry.  In this part of the exercise, unlike the previous one, the main thing is not to overdo it. <br><br>  Grouped?  Forward to the last stage. <br><br>  <b>4. Ask new questions</b> <br><br>  Do not be scared.  There will be only 10. They have already guessed where they will come from?  That's right!  From the received 10 groups. <br>  At this stage you need to ask one capacious question for each group, the answer to which will include the answers to the questions of the whole group. <br><br>  The result of the exercise will be 10 comprehensive questions, the answers to which will give a complete description of the situation. <br><br>  <b>5. And what to do with it?</b> <br><br>  You decide.  Take these questions to the meeting, ask your colleagues or relatives, look for the answer on the Internet.  Or do as I do. <br><br>  I repeat these questions many times about myself in order to remember them as best as possible and go for a walk. <br><br>  Mechanical work (in my case, walking) enhances brain activity, so sometimes the answers come by themselves while the brain is working ‚Äúin the background‚Äù, sometimes they are the results of a thorough analysis and search. <br><br>  The most important thing here is to remember to take a notebook and pen for a walk. <br><br>  PS This technique is described in the book of MDGelba ‚ÄúLearn to think and draw like Leonardo da Vinci‚Äù. <br><br>  The next article will be devoted to the ‚ÄúZD - analysis‚Äù method. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/137858/">https://habr.com/ru/post/137858/</a></p>
