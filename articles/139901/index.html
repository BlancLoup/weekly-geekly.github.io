  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The explanation to transfer of "iron" hubs from "Habr" on Geektimes</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Last week we <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/tm/blog/139898/">transferred</a> several thematic hubs from Habrahabra to Geektimes.  Unfortunately, we hardly commented on our actions to the audience, and this was our mistake.  According to your negative reaction, we realized that some misunderstanding had occurred, and in this connection we decided to tell why we took this step. <br><br> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/139901/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0a1/f75/676/0a1f756769014e299bd8c7be4af613bc.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The first problem we encountered in the separation of projects was the groping of the face where one project ends and another begins.  Habr used to be ‚Äúone basket in which all the eggs were kept‚Äù, but for several reasons we had to separate projects.  At the same time, we, like you, understand that there is no unambiguous border between projects - much from Habr was appropriate on Hiktimes and vice versa.  Similarly with Megamind. <br><br>  Conventionally, we divide our projects as follows: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
    <ul><li>  <b><a href="http://habrahabr.ru/">Habrahabr.ru</a></b> - professional community.  Site about development, programming, administration, security.  After the separation, the project became the most hardcore for developers, administrators and other techies.  The site welcomes the most technical articles. <br><br>  The resource must have a clear positioning.  We want Habr to be focused on people who are engaged in development, and mostly intangible things - sites, applications, games, systems.  This is our goal, which we set out for a long time and are moving towards it. <br><br></li><li>  <b><a href="http://geektimes.ru/">Geektimes.ru</a></b> is a general education community for expanding horizons.  The main topics are technologies, the future, cosmonautics and other scientific sites, gadgets, hardware, news of large companies.  The site welcomes detailed publications of any level of technicality, including ‚Äúwith code‚Äù and without.  We see this project as interesting for a wider audience of tech-savvy people, most of whom are able to program as well. <br><br></li><li>  <b><a href="http://megamozg.ru/">Megamozg.ru</a></b> is a professional community about management, finance, monetization, analytics, startups, freelancing, career, education, legislation, research, marketing, media, etc.  The site welcomes detailed publications of any level of technicality, including "without a code." <br></li></ul><br>  On each of the projects, you can find hundreds of examples of publications that will be relevant not for the project on which they are located (since the publications were not moved manually and individually, but in whole sections).  But nevertheless, " <i>Habr - about programming</i> ", " <i>Giktayms - about hardware and technology</i> ", " <i>Megamind - about startups and management</i> " <br><br>  The main iron hubs (" <a href="http://geektimes.ru/hub/cpu/">processors</a> ", " <a href="http://geektimes.ru/hub/videocards/">video cards</a> ", " <a href="http://geektimes.ru/hub/gadgets/">gadgets</a> ", etc.) moved from Habr to Geektimes at the time of the first separation.  The question of transferring the rest of the "iron" hubs, which on the one hand is about iron, on the other hand - about the code, we discussed throughout the team all spring and summer.  We did not have a 100% certainty that it was necessary to do just that, so we just watched the activity in these hubs, and ultimately decided to make these changes. <br><br>  Someone will rightly note that the hub " <a href="http://geektimes.ru/hub/iot_dev/">Development for the Internet-things</a> " or " <a href="http://geektimes.ru/hub/robo_dev/">Development of robotics</a> " contains the word "Development", which means "this is for Habr."  But if you dig a little deeper, it turns out that in the end it turns out something tangible, be it a robot or a polivalka of flowers on the Arduino.  And in our understanding, this is already a gadget theme, that is, Geektimes.  And this is also a speech about ‚Äúideal‚Äù situations, when there is something about development in the publication - usually they put anything into these hubs that were somehow connected to robotics: repair of quadcopters, announcement of artificial intelligence systems, announcement of new motherboards and so on. <br><br>  Someone will also rightly note that ‚Äú <em>you would then manually transfer such problematic posts, why touch the whole section ?!</em>  "And will be partly right.  Yes, we could make a transfer of publications (it already exists, but only for internal use), but this would be a struggle with the investigation, but not with the cause.  While the reason - the presence of hubs on one of the projects that are more suitable for another.  As long as there is such a disposition, it will be a kind of ‚Äúbackdoor‚Äù through which some users, in pursuit of metrics, will strive to post irrelevant publications.  What for? <br><br>  It is foolish to spray one topic on two projects, conventionally dividing them according to ‚Äúlevels of complexity‚Äù - let it be better, everything is located on any one resource that fits better under it.  And in this case, robots, hardware, boards, circuitry (circuits for devices and gadgets) are all geektimes.  There is a huge intersection of the audience between the projects, so there‚Äôs nothing to worry about a programming post on GT, with a piece of code - the local audience is well-versed in such things.  On Geektimes both general education posts and publications with pieces of code can be posted, while only technical publications are welcome on Habr√©. <br><br>  Well, the last.  Separately, I want to emphasize that we consider people working with glands to be very cool.  Therefore, we did not have thoughts, and even less the desire to show disrespect, transferring hubs that are interesting to you to another resource.  Moreover, we don‚Äôt want to divide ‚Äúprogrammers‚Äù and ‚Äúgeeks‚Äù into two camps - we just make related resources, each of which can be useful to both audiences. <br><br><h1>  <font color="#78a2b7">Instead of the total</font> </h1><br>  Having made such changes, we made Habr an even more technical project - lately it matured, became an even more specialized resource, while a year ago many wrote that Habr is incomprehensible about what and ‚Äú <em>why should I write something if the main page only posts about the rovers and gadgets</em> .  Also, these changes will allow us to soon improve the PPA and make it more accessible. <br><br>  We do not plan to transfer hubs back at the moment and we ask you to treat this with understanding. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/139901/">https://habr.com/ru/post/139901/</a></p>
