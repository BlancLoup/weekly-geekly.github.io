  <section class="page js-page"><h1>As I wrote to the skad. Part two</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good day to all.  I apologize for such a long lack of information, but the Habra effect covered me on all fronts after my first publication, I didn‚Äôt even expect that the development among the people would be so interesting, and I was very complimentary that my plan would be interesting to people as my brains and knowledge.  But about everything in brief and in order.  Since I‚Äôve already been scolded for such a portty style of the past blog, I‚Äôll be brief ... <br>  The first part of the story of my suicide began here "How I wrote to the Scud": <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/programming/124427/">habrahabr.ru/blogs/programming/124427</a> <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Immediately after the publication, I kissed the WEEK only and did what I received messages and talked about this topic with people who showed interest, even if just in a small conversation ‚Äúon the topic‚Äù.  But the most interesting was the appeal in which I was offered to become the architect of the national program in a certain industry niche (litter, I will not reveal secrets), in which the person who invited me acted as a manager.  He is well done, and I hope his idea will still be a success, and I will be able to play the role of a brain in it, albeit a small one. <br>  Despite this, now actively continue the development of the product.  During these six months, a number of key events have occurred: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ I closed my gaps in the network exchange and added the first prototype of the network mechanism to the system, which allows me to develop distributed projects with network exchange in my mind. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Thoroughly reworked the engine and divided the flow of graphics and mathematics into really separate streams, which gave significant advantages in the speed of the system in general (I had to read a few books and articles on this topic). <br>  ‚Ä¢ Worked many aspects of the technological presentation of data, because in the field of the process control system for the same discrete states, it processes not two, but three information states.  Oh, how important, even though it looks like spintronics. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Added support for hot backup functions with quasi-real-time data synchronization between servers and workstations. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Improved service for debugging projects in runtime mode, giving the developer maximum emphasis on tracking and debugging data processing through logical channels of interaction of parameters within the project structure in execution modes. <br>  ‚Ä¢ On real projects - developed and simplified solutions for the gradual integration of the system into already operating solutions without disturbing their performance.  And even run them on real examples, which are now working on objects. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Finally launched the site and began to gradually develop it in terms of content: help, video courses, ready-made solutions. <br>  ‚Ä¢ On occasion - it was possible to penetrate a serious facility, where my system has been working as a top-level AWPs for a month now, replacing a serious brand, and the local staff was only happy when I switched to my solution. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Two third-party developers started a trial implementation of my system at their sites, as a convenient alternative to a domestic brand.

      And this is not counting the improvements and amendments, the list of which draws only transfers for a couple of sheets. <br>  We work.  We communicate.  We are finalizing.  And most importantly - we believe that on our street Kamaz with gingerbread will also come true! <br>  By the way, sitting on the object, when introducing one of the projects, in all its glory I appreciated my idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe full vector basis of the graphic interface - now in one instant the graphics in runtime can be modified to any screen resolution without modifying the project and loss of quality and control functions.  Many service engineers, who saw this, wrote boiling water on this chip.  I have not yet seen such worthy solutions from any of the famous brands. <br>  I am pleased with the results, and even more - they say that ‚Äúit‚Äù is efficient and has the right to its niche in the field, and all this gives me more strength for its development! <br><br>  Unfortunately, I am still in the mode when I still do all the development and implementation in my free time: evenings after work, weekends.  Yes, I get tired, now I am fighting with my ‚Äúsenior‚Äù in the industry at the main job, trying to prove at the test site with a demonstration of work and profitable chips to the company interest in the speed and quality of development, but for now the GOSTs and the psychological ‚Äúone person cannot do it‚Äù are against me, but the facts are already beginning to play their part.  Break through!  The fact that I myself and alone - the majority of the people just for some reason scares.  Although, in terms of risks, I understand them, I would also not take such risks in some decisions ... <br>  What else I would like to note - more and more I fall in love with .Net technology  I am not a programmer, and many of the proprietary things of this profession are still alien to me.  But even in spite of this, I began to notice for myself one feature - I began not to "write programs", and I began to talk to the PC.  My work in this project has become more like communication with a computer in style: I know what I want to get at the output, and I can tell you what needs to be done for this, without going into the detailed elaboration of the technology that underlies this function.  And it becomes normal, logical and simple for me this programming style, rather than explaining to the car the style of the rules, how to work correctly and not to make dangerous situations, from the point of view of security and stability.  Maybe this is what I‚Äôm wrong about, but there‚Äôs someone to kick my ass and say that I‚Äôm an idiot, right? <br>  Once again, I apologize for delaying the series of publications that I planned to start with my first article, but now the amount of information and affairs in this direction has become so great that I don‚Äôt have time for all of this, and I try to at least occasionally break out and make a bit of a copywriter. <br>  Thank you for your attention and interest in the topic! <br><br><habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/138874/">https://habr.com/ru/post/138874/</a></p>
