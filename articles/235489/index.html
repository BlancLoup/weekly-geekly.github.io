While the videos reviewing the new iPhone are diverging over the Web a week before the release, the company is preparing backs to change the ecosystem of applications.  So, on September 2, Apple's guidelines for app review were updated. <br><br>  From a <a href="http://appadvice.com/appnn/2014/09/apple-updates-app-store-review-guidelines-with-sections-for-new-features-in-ios-8">brief squeeze of updates</a> , attention should be paid to the appearance of two sections.  One of them is devoted to using the distribution service Testflight, which Apple swallowed not so long ago.  The second is the use of extensions.  In general, the new sections are four - from 25 to 28. In addition to this, Apple has made in the guideline an emphasis on the fact that your application should be useful.  Right and wrote! <br><br>  <i>We have over a million Apps in the App Store.</i>  <i>If your app doesn‚Äôt have something to do, it‚Äôs not worth it.</i>

    <h4>  Two-thirds of apps on the App Store are free </h4><br>  Applift prepared an <a href="http://www.applift.com/blog/app-store-stats-bonanza.html">overview of App Store data</a> based on open sources.  Most of the numbers should not raise questions to anyone, so that no cover was broken.  Nevertheless, the overall numbers look fascinating. <br><br>  So, ‚Öî applications in the App Store are free, in second place applications cost $ 0.99, with a share of 15%.  Further, the fall of the shares is uneven, so there are jumps in the number of applications worth $ 4.99 and $ 9.99.  All that is more expensive, takes no more than 4.4%.  Given these data, you can put an end to it and say with confidence that applications costing more than $ 10 are extremely rare, and you can enter this price category only with complete confidence that your application can really offer something that justifies the ‚Äúgigantic‚Äù cost. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d3b/7b7/4b1/d3b7b74b10594278a86b90369e14ee2d.png"><br><br>  The most popular category by the number of applications is Games, the share is almost 20%, followed by Education, Business, Lifestyle, and Entertainment.  The most ‚Äúempty‚Äù categories are Graphics and Design, Tools for Development, Photographs, Health and Fitness, this is the end of all geeks' prerogative - Technical News. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Applift shows statistics of the total number of applications in the store.  Thus, the number of applications by July 2014 reached more than 1 million 200 thousand, of which 18% are gaming applications.  Interestingly, at the start of the desktop game applications accounted for 50% of all applications. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/251/b86/031/251b86031b8645cdacdc52aea741cd84.png"><br><br>  Also, the graph shows that the active growth in the number of applications, observed since 2008, slowed down significantly by 2014. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bb0/2a1/dcf/bb02a1dcf4c64987b15217634549c035.png"><br><br>  The number of applications sent to the server in March has reached more than 45,000, with the schedule we can conclude that there are jumps before the Christmas holidays, which increases the load on the department of Apple's Apple and, as a result, increases the time for surveillance.  Therefore, plan to start before Christmas more responsibly, otherwise you may not have time. <br><br>  We recommend to follow the link to get the most complete information on the data. <br><br><h4>  Statistics of rejects - more information! </h4><br>  We continue the holiday news from Apple.  The company decided to remind once again of its rules for accepting applications on the App Store, and also shared the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/rejections/">statistics of redgets</a> .  But first, the captain of evidence will tell about the moments, having missed that you will definitely receive a refusal at the reception.  The most important thing is drops and errors.  If an Apple reviewer receives an application that dies in his hands, he will not be able to easily endure such an injury. <br><br>  If he sees that some of the images are obviously temporary, and the application, even if it is just ‚Äújust a minute‚Äù to the development, promises to replace it in the near future, all the same, the wounded feeling of beauty will not allow to miss this program.  For each application, up-to-date and working links to the support service are required, as well as, if necessary, a link to the privacy policy used. <br><br>  Do not forget the sore subject with IDFA lately: if you use this identifier (and what remains!), But do not show ads or the application does not contain any ad functionality at all, then the application for admission to the store can be rejected.  Also, do not forget to correctly tick the application settings related to how you use IDFA.  Do not forget to specify a test username and password if the program strictly requires authentication to log on. <br><br>  If there is still some information, without the possession of which the application cannot be fully tested, please note: the person evaluating the program will not understand.  Well, you can not promise any functionality that the program does not contain, do not mislead the user.  There are still a few small things left, such as the application‚Äôs lack of value as such, the repeated submission of similar applications, violation of the policy adopted by Apple‚Äôs UI - all this will also lead to a sad failure. <br><br>  The company cited the top 10 reasons for the refusal for the seven-day period from August 21: <br>  14% - Need more <s>ziggurats of</s> information!  The application failed to fully test for some reason. <br>  8% - Bugs! <br>  6% - Non-compliance with the Developer Program License Agreement (this is most likely for the most part problems with IDFA). <br>  6% - Bad, bad UI.  The discrepancy set by Apple. <br>  5% - Name, picture or description does not match the program.  There may be various reasons, maybe someone else is trying to perform a little ASO with the help of a wildly long name that includes all the vices of the human race.  Well, or just cheating. <br>  5% - Explicit substitution of the name, icon or appearance for disguise for other applications.  Flare of Engri Flappy Birds! <br>  4% - Mismatch of the name specified for iTunes and displayed on the device. <br>  4% - Applications contain pictures or text stubs. <br>  3% - Incorrect rating for the application. <br>  2% - "Beta", "Demo", "Test" application.  Most likely, this is part of the applications that were sent by chance, for example, in investigations like: ‚ÄúWhy don't inapp-purchases work, maybe you need to click submit?‚Äù <br><br>  Easy for you to review the application! <br><br><h4>  All reports from Unite 2014 </h4><br>  We talked about the Unity event last time.  At Unite 2014, many interesting things were shown.  It seems that they did not master everything, but we definitely recommend some reports. <br><br>  - The main novelty of version 4.6 is the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/v/7JhmVTEx_EA%3Fversion%3D3%26f%3Dplaylists%26app%3Dyoutube_gdata">new UI system</a> <br>  - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/v/gVUgF2ZHveo%3Fversion%3D3%26f%3Dplaylists%26app%3Dyoutube_gdata">New Asset Bands System</a> <br>  - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/v/51vtyM5aS-M%3Fversion%3D3%26f%3Dplaylists%26app%3Dyoutube_gdata">Reduce risks and increase the quality of multiplatform development on Unity3D</a> <br>  - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/v/ywbdVTRe-aA%3Fversion%3D3%26f%3Dplaylists%26app%3Dyoutube_gdata">New network system in future Unity3D 5.x</a> <br>  - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/v/-EjAjl26itM%3Fversion%3D3%26f%3Dplaylists%26app%3Dyoutube_gdata">Unity3D in the clouds</a> (car assembly and sharing system for QA and team) <br><br>  <a href="http://unity3d.com/unite/archive/2014">The entire archive of reports</a> <br><br><h4>  Unilead will monetize the Moscow metro </h4><br>  In order to finish on the domestic news, we inform you that the Unilead advertising network reached the Wi-Fi-network owned by Maxima Telecom.  On the portal <a href="http://www.vmet.ro/">www.vmet.ro, Unilead</a> agency <a href="http://apptractor.ru/marketing-monetization/ad-networks/vmet-ro-i-unilead-stali-partnerami.html">will be engaged in the placement of mobile games and applications advertising on the CPA model</a> . <br><br>  Every day 400 thousand unique users visit the portal.  At the same time, the number of new users is still growing by 7-10% weekly.  According to their statistics, on average, users spend 2 minutes on the portal (I wonder who these people are? I‚Äôm definitely not connecting to Wi-Fi in the metro for this site).  It is also known that by the end of 2014 Wi-Fi will work on all lines of the Moscow metro, which will significantly increase the number of unique users. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/235489/">https://habr.com/ru/post/235489/</a></p>
