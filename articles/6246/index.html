Lebedev Studio did not give leadership to any of the closest competitors, gaining 658 points.  This is logical - ALG remains the most promoted brand in the market for creating websites, a company with one of the highest market budgets and a consistently high, with rare exceptions, quality of work.  It should be noted that the subsidiary structure of ALG - Teletype studio (16 points), which is not particularly active in the market, lost 34 positions in the rating and took a modest 52nd place. <br><br>  The top five remained unchanged, Actis Systems firmly holds second place with a decent margin from competitors.  Nevertheless, one permutation occurred in the top five - RBC Soft (401 points) was able to outperform Defa gruppe (393 points), although the difference is so insignificant that the two companies practically shared the 3rd and 4th places.

      ADV / web-engineering, as in the past year, confidently closes the top five, but with a decent lag behind its closest competitors. <br>  <b>TOP-10</b> <br>  In the Top-10 of our rating, on the contrary, there have been very significant changes compared to last year. <br>  The most significant events are the growth of the X-project from 10th to 6th place (156 points), as well as the rapid rise in the top ten of Samara‚Äôs Dominion studio to 9th place (108 points), which managed to bypass a number of major Moscow and All Petersburg studios.  It should be said that in the growth of the Dominion there is a significant merit of its PR activity in the market, since, according to our estimates, the real turnover of the studio is still lower than most of the companies in the first twenty. <br>  The DOT agency lost one position, taking a worthy 7th place (135 points). <br>  Promo Interactive entered the top ten in 8th place (113 points), rising by 6 positions compared to last year. <br>  The only representative of large networked companies in Armenia - PRIOR.RU showed a good growth rate, taking 10th place (103 points), having risen by as much as 12 positions compared to the previous year. <br><br>  <b>Some comments</b> <br><br>  <strong>Sergey Ryzhikov,</strong> independent expert, director of Bitrix <br>  <i>‚ÄúYes, indeed, the curious rating turned out.</i>  <i>Given the testing methodology, we actually got the opportunity to look at the market through the eyes of the professionals of the market itself.</i>  <i>In my opinion, the distribution of shares and rating look different.</i>  <i>But this is my subjective opinion, which, although based on a large amount of information, is still incomplete.</i>  <i>I will refrain from direct comments, who does not take his place, who is undervalued and why it happened.</i>  <i>I am sure that each company will draw its own conclusions from a similar recognition rating of colleagues in the workshop.</i>  <i>It seems to me that next year we should try to build a similar consumer rating and a rating of real balance sheet turnover.</i>  <i>It seems to me that it is precisely these three ratings that will give an opportunity to understand who the professionals consider to be the best, who consumers prefer, and to whom they actually give their money. ‚Äù</i> <br>  <strong>Anna Sverdlova,</strong> Managing Director, Actis Systems <br>  <i>We are certainly glad that our colleagues once again highly appreciated the share of Actis Systems in the field of our company's main activity.</i>  <i>Over the past year, we know that this rating is used by many analysts and potential clients to obtain a more objective understanding of our rather opaque market.</i>  <i>Indeed, it is not surprising that the studios working mainly with Russian ‚Äúblue chips‚Äù and international companies got into the top 5 leaders.</i> <br>  <i>This year, as in the past, the positioning of companies, especially after the first 5, is somewhat surprising: there is a feeling that even market professionals are guided more by the brand‚Äôs ‚Äúpromotion‚Äù than by the real positions of some studios in the market (which are not only from number of projects, but also from their average cost).</i>  <i>The low positions of studios, which work mainly not with end-customers, but with various advertising and BTL agencies, are also surprising - this segment also makes up a rather tangible share of our market - most likely also because it is important for such studios to be ‚Äúpromoted‚Äù not for a broad public and community site builders, and for a narrow circle of advertisers.</i>  <i>And once again it surprises (albeit less than last year) that some studios have so far been judged by their past achievements in website building, and not by their current position in the market.</i> <br>  <strong>Alexey Persianov,</strong> Director, ADV / web-engineering <br>  <i>There is a suitable parable for Daniel Kharms on this subject:</i> <br>  <i>An amazing incident happened to me: I suddenly forgot that it was before - 7 or 8. I went to the neighbors and asked them what they thought about this.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>What was their and my surprise when they suddenly found that they too can not remember the order of counting.</i>  <i>1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 remember, and then forget.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>We all went to the grocery store ‚ÄúGastronom‚Äù, which is on the corner of Znamenskaya and Basseynaya streets, and asked the cashier about our bewilderment.</i>  <i>The cashier smiled sadly, took a small hammer out of her mouth and, slightly moving her nose, said:</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- In my opinion, seven comes after eight when eight comes after seven.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>We thanked the cashier and happily ran out of the store.</i>  <i>But here, pondering over the words of the cashier, we were again sad because her words seemed to us to be devoid of any meaning.</i>  <i>What should we do?</i>  <i>We went to the Summer Garden and started counting trees there.</i>  <i>But having reached 6, we stopped and began to argue: in the opinion of some, 7 followed, in the opinion of others, 8. We would argue for a very long time, but, fortunately, some child fell off the bench and broke himself both jaws.</i>  <i>This distracted us from our argument.</i>  <i>And then we went home.</i> <br>  <i>In addition to the above, I would like to rejoice at the abundance of familiar and high-quality names in the top twenty.</i>  <i>Hey.</i>  <i>:)</i> <br>  <strong>Mikhail Kozlov,</strong> independent expert, director of internet marketing for Ashmanov &amp; Partners <br>  <i>The leaderboard was pretty predictable.</i>  <i>These are companies that everyone has heard, and their first place is the merit of not only designers, programmers and sales, but also PR people.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>The second or third dozen are much more interesting.</i>  <i>Along with the Krassic developers, there are companies there, known to us more as optimizing ones (Tekart, Matik, Demis and some others).</i>  <i>It can be expected that in the future their positions will be strengthened at the expense of medium-sized customers, who find it much more convenient to work with one performer both in the development and promotion of websites.</i> <i><br></i> <br>  <b>Materials on market research, analysis of the current state, trends, assessment of the volume and other quantitative indicators, etc. will be published today during the day on the <a href="http://2007.tagline.ru/">official project website</a> .</b> <br><br>  Also it would be desirable that when discussing habr-readers familiarized with my <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/blog/web_design/8003.html">previous topic</a> on the project, where I answered the type criticism and questions. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/6246/">https://habr.com/ru/post/6246/</a></p>
