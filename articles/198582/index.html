Instead of listing the numbers, indicators and titles of reports and panels, let's recall some moments of IDCEE 2013 and try to remember its spirit and mood. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><hr>

      ... Thursday morning.  While the organizing team moves along the NSC Olimpiyskiy at elevated speeds and strenuously masters the walkie-talkies with headphones, the first participants flocks to the entrance, simultaneously filling instagram with almost identical photographs of the area near the Kiev metro station Olympiyskaya. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img width="640" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a21/93c/7bd/a2193c7bdda4d49818fea6fcba4051d3.jpg"></div><br><br>  From this point on, the passage of time was constantly accelerating.  After the opening with Victoria Tigipko and Alan Patricof, three scenes of the conference began to work simultaneously - and away we went. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img width="640" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0f4/bfb/fe1/0f4bfbfe1335e109d009b5eb384b2eed.jpg"></div><br><br><hr><br><br>  ... Startup Alley is one of the most crowded places at the conference.  On the first day, the start-ups gathered at the conference venue by seven o'clock in the morning to assemble and arrange the stands, so by nine, when participants started to come here, they were already ready to pit everything that was moving. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img width="640" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/959/fa8/1a0/959fa81a0eed977250d331abd6028f34.jpg"></div><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img width="640" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e57/91c/391/e5791c391380bc36ee9f08c15fd23b26.jpg"></div><br><br><hr><br><br>  A few hours later, the first projects selected by the expert committee were presented on the main stage, competing for a portion of the ‚Ç¨ 30,000 prize pool, not counting additional nominations.  It seems that this part of the conference was one of the most interesting for both startups and viewers: I was at three of the four pitching sessions, and each time I saw a full hall. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img width="640" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6b8/75c/68c/6b875c68cfb9ae816e472f6965f1b1b6.jpg"></div><br><br>  Now, after the conference, I will try not to lose sight of the 12 best startups: with a high probability at least half of them will still declare themselves in the market. <br><br><hr><br><br>  ... At about five o'clock in the evening, a relatively small Technological scene was tested for strength: viewers who wanted to know the fate of several grants of $ 30,000 from the GTF stood in the aisles, and the ‚Äútail‚Äù went out into the corridor at the press center. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img width="640" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/45b/9d0/b46/45b9d0b46124df86eaddddc0f275cca8.jpg"></div><br><br>  In the dim light with smoke and lasers, grants were awarded to Ukrainian projects myTips, Jeapie and Hashtago.  I must say that for some reason their founders on the stage looked extremely surprised.  However, I think they know where to put extra money. <br><br><hr><br><br>  ... New day - new music.  On Thursday, before the start of the conference and at the end of the program, guests could listen to Katya Chilly (Ukrainian folk / electronics / trance), and on Friday Brazilian guitarist Phil Machado was on the stage. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img width="640" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e2e/a59/eeb/e2ea59eeb4c4aec2e6d8fc5bcf007719.jpg"></div><br><br>  His morning performance created the mood for the whole day and, I hope, helped some participants to survive the consequences of the party the night before. <br><br><hr><br><br>  The schedule of the three scenes was packed almost to capacity, so it was very difficult to decide where to go and whom to listen to.  I think those who spent most of the second day at the Main Stage remembered a really interesting and informative panel discussion about startup accelerators in Eastern Europe and in the West. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img width="640" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6d3/d53/149/6d3d531496fe71c9c2fce278cf137435.jpg"></div><br><br>  If I had a startup, I would seriously think about submitting documents to one of the submitted incubators. <br><br><hr><br><br>  The second day, with all the panel discussions, presentations and discussions, flew by even faster than the first and ended with a regular award ceremony.  This time, members of the jury and representatives of the companies distributed prizes to the winners of the main competition and additional nominations. <br><br>  Remember these names: Ubertesters, Backendless, KreditAja, Kabanchik, AstraFit, VitalFields.  I think we will hear more about them. <br><br><hr><br><br>  And now, as the completion of this erratic afterword, applause to everyone who was on IDCEE'13 ‚Äî mentors and start-ups, participants and volunteers, investors and moderators, organizers and employees of the NSC.  Thanks for a great time, see you in a year! <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img width="640" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c16/e29/a65/c16e29a653ce46d5bc9c874f30e228c9.jpg"></div><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img width="640" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1e1/8b4/ad0/1e18b4ad00a905d073a5c7be2abd95f8.jpg"></div></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/198582/">https://habr.com/ru/post/198582/</a></p>
