  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Pitfalls in the delivery of quadcopters to Ukraine - experience with DHL</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It all started with the fact that I decided to buy a quadrocopter for shooting on a camping trip.  In the Dronk.ru ranking, the Cheerson <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/zl">CX-20</a> proved to be the best for flying with an action camera.  I ordered a copter on GearBest and asked the seller to send as quickly as possible, because it was only two weeks before the trip, and I still had to learn how to fly it.  In principle, in a relatively short time the parcels reach Ukraine by mail, but I was reinsured and ordered by DHL. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/594/961/49c/59496149c73b45d69970bf146ffb2901.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Three days later, tracking showed that the package was in Kiev at customs (standard procedure for all imported goods).  The next day, the status of the package did not change, and I began to worry that something had happened.  But even more it was not clear why they did not get in touch with me.  A couple of days later, an email finally arrived in which GearBest reported that they could not contact me at DHL and the package could be sent back. <br><br>  I immediately called the Ukrainian office of DHL to clarify the situation.  It turned out that an error was made in the phone number, and they could not reach me.  I left the correct number and began to wait for a new call with details.

From this news I was covered with cold sweat.  Surely everyone read the story about a man who had a criminal case for a Chinese pen with a camera.  I started to google on the topic of illegality of importation of copters into Ukraine, but did not find anything.  But about the problems associated with DHL, the information was in abundance.  It turns out that they very often require all kinds of certificates and permissions from recipients.  With regard to possible problems with the law, I began to calm down, but the situation continued to remain unclear. <br><br>  A little more googling, I learned about the procedure for obtaining permission from the SBUshnikov.  There is nothing complicated in it, but this red tape lasts 7-10 days.  I did not have so much time, so I called DHL again to find out why they suddenly needed permission from the security service, because nowadays you can buy a quadcopter without any permissions in almost any online store in Ukraine.  The dialogue with the delivery representative turned out to be rather strange.  The man at the end of the wire argued that the <b>quadcopter is not a toy,</b> that <b>it can be used for terrorist purposes,</b> and there are only two ways to get a package: either get a piece of paper from a military unit confirming that I am a volunteer and ordered an unmanned remotely piloted aircraft for needs of the army, or go to the Security Service and get a piece of paper there.  I was already thinking of dropping the phone and coming to terms with the loss of the quadcopter and money, when suddenly the word ‚Äúcamera‚Äù slipped into the conversation.  ‚ÄúWait, but he is without a camera!‚Äù I protested.  In the end, the representative agreed to open the package and check again. <br><br>  An hour later, they called me and said that there was really no camera, and therefore no separate import permits were needed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d0f/08b/a27/d0f08ba2712d45dfa0ff489dd05c1178.jpg"><br><br>  In general, I was lucky that I ordered a model without a camera, otherwise the story would have been completely different. <br><br>  <b>The terrorism charge was dropped, but ...</b> <br><br>  But the customs officer did not give up and said that the specified value of the goods is not true, and the parcel will be sent to me only after I write an application for raising the assessed value.  Somewhere on the Internet, they found the price of $ 350 and offered to issue it at this price instead of the declared 49.90.  And, of course, add to this about 20% of the cost for customs clearance and services. <br><br>  Further correspondence with the broker by e-mail took place.  I sent a link to the product with a price of $ 207 and asking for permission to indicate this amount in the application.  As a result, the package was issued at the right price. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Application and agreement with the customs broker</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/efa/7ed/2db/efa7ed2db88c4b069aac6cd3ddcfdd2f.JPG"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6be/fd0/320/6befd03205ae424b862f339931373181.JPG"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e45/1d9/554/e451d95544c4460d9d5234ca5f3b5bd1.JPG"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d0c/e19/f51/d0ce19f518a644178514373e1a05739a.JPG"><br></div></div><br><br>  On Friday evening I received a letter from the broker about the completion of the parcel, and on Monday they sent me an invoice for UAH 896.59 (~ $ 41), which I immediately paid for.  Of the above mentioned amount, UAH 416.59 (~ $ 19) amounted to duties, and UAH 480 (~ $ 22) was the cost of the ‚Äúservices‚Äù of the broker.  In the morning the next day the courier called me and asked me to meet him at one o'clock at the bus station (remember, this is an expensive and fast DHL delivery service).  In the middle of the working day, I rushed to the bus station, where, having signed, I finally received my package. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d98/976/b2a/d98976b2a6c64abdae40c1dc6ba95b0d.jpg" width="640"><br><br><h1>  findings </h1><br>  If you decide to order a quadrocopter from China to Ukraine, then you should remember a few important points: <br><br>  1. Do not use the services of DHL. <br>  2. If you can buy a quadrocopter without a camera, then it is better to buy without a camera in order not to follow the resolution in the SBU. <br>  3. If you decide to buy all the same with the camera, then it is better to prepare for the questions indicated in the article in advance. <br><br>  My case ended peacefully enough, and, of course, this does not mean that it will be so with everyone.  I recommend that you use only proven public services of fast delivery EMS and Ukrpochta, which are slightly inferior to DHL, and the latter has been pleased with the speed of delivery lately. <br><br>  That's all, successful flight, you wish service on the choice of quadrocopters <a href="http://dronk.ru/">Dronk.Ru</a> <br><br>  Do not forget to subscribe to our <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/dronk/blog/">blog</a> , there will be many more interesting things. <br><br>  <b>You may also like the articles:</b> <br>  - <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/dronk/blog/253414/">Which quadcopter to choose for GoPro?</a>  <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/dronk/blog/253414/">Consider the best among the budget</a> <br>  - <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/dronk/blog/253352/">Video broadcast from $ 75 quadrocopter?</a>  <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/dronk/blog/253352/">We look Syma X5SW</a> <br>  - <a href="http://dronk.ru/blog/fpv-kvadrokopter-za-100-dollarov/">Choose a quadcopter with video streaming for $ 100</a> <br>  - <a href="http://dronk.ru/blog/kupite-kvadrokopter/">Buy a quadcopter and say goodbye to him - where did the Phantom fly?</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/365885/">https://habr.com/ru/post/365885/</a></p>
