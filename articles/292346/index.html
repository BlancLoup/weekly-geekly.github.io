  <section class="page js-page"><h1>BRICS are going to agree on e-commerce regulation</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Before the opening of the summit of the BRICS Heads of State, which will soon begin, a meeting of a delegation of economic ministries from five countries was held.  Within the framework of this meeting, the issues of online trading were discussed for the first time, as well as methods of its regulation and support, Kommersant <a href="http://kommersant.ru/doc/2763454">writes</a> .  The topic of e-commerce has become the key. <br><br>  It is worth noting that all the representatives of the countries participating in this meeting agreed on the need to implement coordinated measures for regulating e-commerce.  Thus, according to the Ministry of Economics of the Russian Federation Alexey Ulyukayev, Russia's trade with the BRICS countries has doubled over the past 7 years.  In monetary terms, the volume of Russia's trade with the BRICS efforts in 2014 reached $ 107 billion. As for the total volume of trade between the countries, this figure reached $ 291 billion. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  ‚ÄúOur countries are countries with a large territory and an underdeveloped infrastructure for physical trade and investment in this infrastructure.  In this sense, e-commerce is very important and of particular importance.  It makes it possible to bridge the gap in the accessibility of the population to the services of trade and to obtain high quality goods and services at low costs, ‚Äùsaid Alexey Ulyukayev. <br><br>  According to the general opinion of the meeting participants, e-commerce in the BRICS countries is developing very rapidly, while being a specific driver of economic growth.  For example, in Brazil, the volume of the e-commerce market grew by 28% in 2014, compared with 2013.  In India, the volume of e-commerce each year grows by 30%, while in South Africa, according to the Minister of Commerce and Industry of this country, Rob Davis, there is an ‚Äúexplosion of electronic commerce‚Äù.

      Representatives of China believe that e-commerce allows small and medium-sized businesses to get timely access to customers, finding additional markets for their products.  ‚ÄúFarmers can sell their unique products directly to buyers who have more confidence in the producers themselves than in intermediaries,‚Äù said Wang Shouwen, Deputy Minister of Commerce of China.  Shouven also expressed the opinion that it is necessary to confirm the quality of the exported goods and simplify customs clearance.  Other participants of the meeting agreed with this opinion.  ‚ÄúParticipants in public procurement must conduct trading in electronic form.  E-commerce also helps small and medium-sized enterprises to take a place in regional and global markets, ‚Äùsaid Jagdish Saxena Deepak, Deputy Minister of Trade and Industry of India. <br><br>  The importance of e-commerce was also noted by Viktor Klimov, behind the State Duma‚Äôs Economic Policy and Entrepreneurship Committee.  According to Klimov, for the development of the industry, countries need to solve several problems at once, including the creation of a single legally significant document flow, as well as issues of cryptography and identification of participants in the transaction. <br><br>  The meeting participants agreed that the action plan for the development of cooperation between the BRICS countries in the field of electronic commerce may well be used as the basis of the memorandum of understanding. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/292346/">https://habr.com/ru/post/292346/</a></p>
