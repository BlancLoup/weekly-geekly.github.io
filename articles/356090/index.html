It will contain data on critical elements of the Russian network segment, for example, autonomous systems, IP addresses, traffic exchange points. <br>  Probably, these data companies and will need to transfer to the system.  If the bill is adopted, the exact composition of the information and the procedure for their presentation will be established by the government. <br>  Recall that companies can not only rent or get their IP-address, but also have an autonomous system that allows you to connect to two or more providers, so as not to depend on one. <br><br>  Document: <a href="http://regulation.gov.ru/projects">Draft Federal Law</a> .
