      We offer to replenish the collection with good books with an 18% discount, the details are inside <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Computer architecture.  6th ed. </h4><br>  Authors: E. Tanenbaum, T. Austin <br><br>  Annotation: the book by Andrew Tanenbaum, a world-renowned specialist in the field of information technology, a writer and teacher, published in the sixth edition, is devoted to the structural organization of a computer.  It is based on the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa hierarchical structure in which each level performs a well-defined function.  As part of this innovative approach, the digital logic level, the level of instruction architecture, the level of the operating system, and the level of assembly language are described in detail.  In the sixth edition made numerous changes that bring the book into line with the rapid development of the computer industry.  In particular, information about the machines presented as examples was updated: Intel Core i7, Texas Instrument OMAP4430 and Atmel ATmega168.  The book is designed for a wide range of readers: both for students of computer technology and for those who are independently acquainted with computer architecture. <br><br>  Available formats: Paper Book, PDF <br><br><h4>  Computer networks.  5th ed. </h4><br>  Authors: E. Tanenbaum, D. Weatherler <br><br>  Annotation: in front of you is the latest, fifth edition of the most authoritative book on modern network technologies, written by renowned expert in this field Andrew Tanenbaum, in collaboration with Professor of Washington University David Weatherler.  The first version of this classic work was born back in 1980, and since then each edition of the book has always become a bestseller and has been used as a basic textbook in leading technical universities.  The book consistently outlines the basic concepts that determine the current state and trends in the development of computer networks.  The authors explain in detail the structure and operation of the hardware and software, consider all aspects and levels of networking - from the physical to the application level.  The presentation of the theoretical principles is complemented by vivid, illustrative examples of the functioning of the Internet and computer networks of various types.  The fifth edition has been completely revised to reflect changes in network technologies in recent years and, in particular, covers aspects such as 802.12 and 802.16 wireless networks, 3G networks, RFID technology, CDN content delivery infrastructure, peer-to-peer networks, streaming, Internet telephony and much more. <br><br>  Available formats: Paper Book, PDF <br><br><h4>  Modern operating systems.  3rd ed. </h4><br>  Author: E. Tanenbaum <br><br>  Annotation: this eagerly awaited, revised and revised edition of the world bestseller includes information on the latest advances in operating system technology.  The book is based on examples and contains information necessary for understanding the functioning of modern operating systems.  The new edition has been significantly modified and supplemented, and includes a description of the device and operation of Windows Vista.  Thanks to the practical experience gained in the development of several operating systems, and a high level of knowledge of the subject, Andrew Tanenbaum was able to clearly and entertainingly tell about complex things.  The book contains many important details that are not found in any other edition. <br><br>  Available formats: Paper Book, PDF <br><br><h4>  C # programming language.  Classic Computers Science.  4th ed. </h4><br>  Authors: A. Hejlsberg, M. Torgersen, S. Wiltamut, P. Gold <br><br>  Annotation: in front of you is the fourth edition of the main book on the C # language, written by programming legend Anders Hejlsberg, the architect of C #, Delphi and Turbo Pascal, together with other experts who were part of the C # development team of Microsoft.  The publication is the most complete description of the language and the most authoritative source of information on this topic, built in the format of a collection of specifications, including a description of the syntax, related materials and examples, as well as code samples.  This book is a kind of ‚Äúbible‚Äù of the developer, which can easily replace both MSDN and other books on C #.  The fourth edition contains a description of the new features of C # 4.0, including dynamic binding, named and optional parameters, as well as covariant and contravariant generic types.  The purpose of these innovations is to enhance the ability of C # to interact with non-.NET objects.  A distinctive feature of the new edition is that each chapter of the book contains extensive comments written by famous programming gurus, such as John Skit, Joseph Albahari, Bill Wagner, Christian Nagel, Eric Lippert, and others. <br><br>  Available format: PDF <br><br><h4>  Object Oriented Programming in C ++.  Computer Science Classic </h4><br>  Author: R. Lafore <br><br>  Annotation: thanks to this book, thousands of users have mastered the object-oriented programming technology in C ++.  It has everything: the basic principles of the language, ready-made full-scale applications, small examples explaining the theory, and many useful illustrations.  The book enjoys a stable success in educational institutions due to the fact that it contains more than 100 exercises, allowing you to test knowledge on all topics.  The reader may not have any training in the C ++ language field at all.  It is only necessary to know the initial principles of programming. <br><br>  Available format: PDF <br><br><h4>  Data structures and algorithms in Java.  Classic Computers Science.  2nd ed. </h4><br>  Author: R. Lafore <br><br>  Annotation: the second edition of one of the most authoritative books on programming is devoted to the use of data structures and algorithms.  Algorithms are the basis of programming, which determines how software being developed will use data structures.  On clear and simple software examples, the author explains this complex topic, inviting readers to write their own programs and learn the gained knowledge in practice.  The considered examples are written in the Java language, although in order to assimilate the material it is not necessary for the reader to know it well - it is enough to be proficient in any programming language, for example C ++.  The first part of the book is an introduction to algorithmization and data structures, and also contains a summary of the foundations of object-oriented programming.  The following sections are devoted to various algorithms and data structures considered from simple to complex: sorting, abstract data types, linked lists, recursion, tree data structures, hashing, pyramids, graphs.  Recommendations on the use of algorithms and the choice of a particular data structure depending on the task are given. <br><br>  Available formats: Paper Book, PDF, EPUB <br><br><h4>  Computer architecture and computer systems design.  Classic Computers Science.  4th ed. </h4><br>  Authors: D. Patterson, J. Hennessy <br><br>  Annotation: the book, coming out in the 4th edition, is devoted to the structural organization of the computer and reflects the revolutionary changes taking place in the field of hardware, in particular, the rapid transition from single-processor systems to multi-core microprocessors.  The publication describes in detail the architecture of the computer and the device of all its components: processors, memory blocks, input-output means and data storage.  A distinctive feature of the book is the demonstration of the interactions between hardware and system software.  Special attention is paid to multi-core computing systems and parallel programming.  Numerous exercises and tasks given after each topic help to consolidate the material.  The book is designed for a wide range of readers: from students of computer technology to experienced developers who want to learn modern concepts of multiprocessor programming. <br><br>  Available format: paper book <br><br>  Link to the <a href="http://f.gdeslon.ru/f/576b140560973458b3bc4a49f58d8d96e43dcdea">whole category</a> and 18% <b>discount</b> - <b>8e655b44822e1732</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/243497/">https://habr.com/ru/post/243497/</a></p>
