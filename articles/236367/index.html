In the near future, they will be very much discussed - this happens with almost everything that the organization issues.  Almost, but not always - today we will talk about one of the not very popular Apple products - the ad network <a href="http://advertising.apple.com/">iAd</a> . <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  What is it </h4><br>  The iAd advertising platform is designed to enable developers of applications for the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad to display ads in their products and make money from it.  It was assumed that the platform will compete with the ad network Google AdMob.

      On the presentation of the new product, Steve Jobs <a href="http://www.cnet.com/news/jobs-to-developers-stick-with-the-winning-team/">urged</a> developers to use iAd, because it ‚Äúwill help them make money.‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f2f/d03/31d/f2fd0331dae34c78d3dd6e7f0eddcc47.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  However, the platform failed to win a leading position in the world of mobile advertising - despite the fact that Apple is the absolute leader in sales of its gadgets, in the applications installed on them, advertising is shown more often through other advertising networks. <br><br>  iAd was created on the basis of the product <a href="http://adage.com/article/digital/mobile-marketing-apple-acquire-ad-network-quattro/141287/">purchased by</a> Apple for $ 275 million of Quattro Wireless (before that, the company <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news%3Fpid%3Dnewsarchive%26sid%3DafcIzFP3iNrY">tried to</a> buy AdMob, but it was ahead of Google). <br><br><h4>  Reason for failure </h4><br>  Initially, the iAd platform was targeted at large advertisers, and Apple set an extremely high entry barrier - the minimum amount of an advertising campaign was $ 1 million. <br><br>  In addition, the company sought to tightly control the content of advertisements.  Also, a significant disadvantage of the Apple advertising platform was the lack of access to Android users - due to the closedness of the ecosystem of the company from Cupertino.  As a result, the share of iAd in the US advertising market does not exceed 3%. <br><br><h4>  Changes </h4><br>  In the summer of 2013, Apple <a href="http://9to5mac.com/2013/06/12/apple-releases-iad-workbench-shifting-iads-focus-heavily-towards-app-developers-rather-than-large-brands/">lowered the</a> minimum installment of about $ 500 thousand first, and then, having passed $ 300, $ 200 and $ 100 thousand marks, and up to only $ 50, reorienting from large companies to independent developers.  There are even <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/apple-considers-launching-ad-exchange-2013-5">rumors</a> on the market that Apple will launch its own advertising market, but this has not yet happened. <br><br>  In the future, the company's advertising ecosystem became more open - all users with an Apple ID account <a href="http://adage.com/article/digital/apple-expands-iad-developers-adds-video-capabilities/292412/">received the</a> opportunity to create iAds ads.  Ads are created using the iAd Workbench web service. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1eb/446/cc1/1eb446cc1a130261e2b4e4b69c891013.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  <i>The picture is clickable</i> <br><br>  In addition, the iAd platform is <a href="http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/05/30/apple-planning-locally-targeted-ads-for-itunes-radio-iad-promotion-of-itunes---report">integrated</a> with the Apple iTunes Radio streaming service. <br><br><h4>  pros </h4><br>  The developer of the application Colorbay under the nickname MetaRain in his blog <a href="http://blog.metarain.com/post/83086723160/an-experiment-in-iad">described the</a> experience of interacting with iAd.  Among the advantages he noted: <br><br><ul><li>  Good targeting options that include age, gender, and previous application downloads ‚Äî Colorbay targeted their ads to users who recently downloaded applications from the Photo &amp; Video and Social Networking categories. </li><li>  The results were quite good - spending $ 24.39, Colorbay developers received 966,648 impressions with CPM $ 0.03.  On the displayed advertisements, users "tapnuli" 1,702 times, and downloaded the application 25 times.  This means that each click cost $ 0.01, and the download of the application $ 0.98. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d6d/0a2/b58/d6d0a2b580ff4bd24d74884943683383.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Not everything was so smooth - by setting fairly tight targeting conditions and a budget of $ 10 per day, the developer found that there were not enough people in the iAd system to select all this money. <br><br>  However, the overall performance of the advertising campaign was at a good level, as MetaRain noted: <br><br><blockquote>  iAd is quite a promising thing.  They seem to be moving in the right direction, so it‚Äôs worth integrating with this platform. </blockquote><br>  Russian application developers iAd may be interested in the fact that since the end of August this year, the advertising platform has officially <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/%3Fid%3D08262014b">started</a> its work in Russia - now you can place ads in 16 countries that belong to the network </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/236367/">https://habr.com/ru/post/236367/</a></p>
