  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Comparison of hardware IP-ATC with cloud solutions</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The activity of any organization is conditioned by the necessity of contacts with external <br>  the world, and often between its employees.  And here you can not do without creating a telephone <br>  network.  Large companies, possessing the necessary resources, do not have serious problems. <br>  with the solution of this problem.  But how to be small and medium enterprises?  IP technology <br>  telephony and equipment for their implementation provide the necessary solution, without requiring <br>  This serious material, time and human costs. <br><br>  The classic scheme is to hold several external analog lines from the city telecom operator, and install a hybrid or analog PBX in the office.  But such a scheme is gradually being supplanted by other options for providing telephony, for example, using ready-made hardware IP-PBX, or PBX in the cloud. <br><br>  In this article, I would like to consider a specific implementation of the scheme with the younger version of the hardware IP-PBX Yeastar MyPBX 400, and compare this option with the cloudy IP-PBX, find out the advantages and disadvantages of each scheme.  By cloud PBXs, we mean virtual PBX services that are being actively developed by many SIP providers. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b7d/4c2/7b3/b7d4c27b39856a65abe8bebd2ea542c7.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  MyPBX 400 is a hardware platform with Asterisk-based firmware installed on it, while full access to the Asterisk configuration is not given, only setting via the web interface.  On the one hand, this simplifies its configuration in such a way that a person who is not particularly versed in telephony can configure it rather quickly, on the other hand it limits the functionality.

      The process of installing expansion cards in the PBX is extremely simple: remove the cover and insert the board into the slots. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e11/0c1/0e0/e110c10e0c41e94e3e53aef43c7ad7d9.png"><br>  The boards will also be useful in case there is a desire to replace the analogue-digital PBX with IP.  With them you can connect existing external lines of the city network. <br><br>  In the line of this manufacturer there are also other models, for example, MyPBX1600, Enterprise M2 and others.  They differ in the number of ports for traditional telephones / faxes / analog external lines, more efficient processors, and, accordingly, support for more internal registrations / external channels / simultaneous calls.  Enterprise M2 also allows you to record conversations in continuous mode on the hard disk inserted into it. <br><br>  A PBX connection to the existing infrastructure is carried out through a regular switch.  If the company already has a local area network, this process is not a problem. <br><br>  A diagram with examples of popular equipment below: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/294/d38/f91/294d38f9162f219761e852875bedbc37.jpg"><br><br>  <b>1)</b> The advantages of such PBXs over the cloud are primarily in the fact that you do not have to pay a monthly fee to the SIP provider every month for providing a virtual PBX.  The subscription fee for using the SIP channel itself, of course, remains.  Thus, if we compare for the price the minimum set of cloud PBX (approximately 1000r per month) with MyPBX400 (approximately 10000r), it turns out that the hardware PBX begins to pay for itself in 10 months.  The price of 1000r for a cloud PBX is very approximate, as providers usually take money for every sneeze. <br><br>  <b>2) The</b> undoubted advantage of the hardware PBX is also the ability to connect an existing analog line (or several lines), as well as a fax.  If the line can still be connected via a gateway with an FXO port, then analog fax can be connected to the cloud PBX much harder, while there is a very big chance that it will not work, especially since the SIP provider usually does not give any guarantees. <br><br>  <b>3) The</b> management of a hardware PBX (in our example) should not be difficult, the web interface is entirely in Russian, and the basic setting takes less than half an hour.  Of course, in this case, in the cloud solution, most of the configuration actions were done for us, and we need to set up registrations on the phones themselves. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/12e/116/f61/12e116f61f23f323a26b71f6a28e8b70.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/055/a6e/9f3/055a6e9f36b67d68f8b93101a0137f7b.png"><br><br>  <b>4)</b> A very important point is the freedom of choice of provider.  If we are obliged to use what it offers to us in the cloud PBX from the provider, then we can specify several SIP providers with the hardware and route them to the cheapest destinations.  Moreover, you can choose a SIP-provider in another country and talk at local prices. <br><br>  <b>5)</b> In both cases, you can connect remote employees / remote offices without any special problems, another thing is that in the case of a hardware PBX, more settings will be needed (port forwarding on the router, and setting up basic security rules).  This also includes the freedom of movement, because SIP registration is not tied to the location of the PBX, and you can connect to the same accounts in any part of the world where there is Internet access. <br>  There is one caveat, if there is a need to protect conversations via the Internet, remote employees or offices to a hardware PBX can be connected through VPN tunnels.  In the case of cloud PBXs, this is usually not possible, and, if desired, the transmitted data is easier to intercept. <br><br>  The hardware PBX MyPBX400 considered in the article has the following characteristics: <br>  <b>Main characteristics</b> <br>  ‚Ä¢ 8 simultaneous conversations <br>  ‚Ä¢ 4 analog FXO / FXS ports, Yeastar S2 (2 FXS), Yeastar O2 (2 FXO) and Yeastar SO (FXS and FXO) modules are connected. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Using S2, O2, SO modules it is possible to choose the required combination of FXS / FXO ports. <br>  ‚Ä¢ 512MB of flash-memory (up to 4000 min of voice mail) <br>  ‚Ä¢ 64 MB RAM <br>  ‚Ä¢ 1 Ethernet port <br>  <b>Voice characteristics</b> <br>  ‚Ä¢ SIP 2.0 protocol support (RFC3261) <br>  ‚Ä¢ Support for voice codecs: G.711, G.726, G.729AB, GSM, Speex, H.261, H.263, H.264 <br>  ‚Ä¢ Echo Cancellation Tools <br>  ‚Ä¢ DTMF broadcast in in-band, out-of-band (RFC2833), SIP Info <br>  ‚Ä¢ Supports unlimited external SIP trunks / extensions (up to 4/36 is recommended) <br>  <b>Main features</b> <br>  ‚Ä¢ The conference <br>  ‚Ä¢ Voice mail <br>  ‚Ä¢ Group call <br>  ‚Ä¢ Queuing <br>  ‚Ä¢ Call Pickup <br>  ‚Ä¢ Call Routing <br>  ‚Ä¢ Call Transfer <br>  ‚Ä¢ Call waiting <br>  ‚Ä¢ Caller ID <br>  ‚Ä¢ Call Detail Records (CDR) <br>  ‚Ä¢ Interactive Answering Machine (IVR) <br>  ‚Ä¢ Do Not Disturb (DND) <br>  ‚Ä¢ Music On Hold <br>  ‚Ä¢ Caller ID Routing <br>  ‚Ä¢ Three simultaneous outgoing calls with one registration <br><br><h5>  Conclusion </h5><br>  As a conclusion, I would like to say that the final choice still depends on the readiness of the company and its leadership to modern solutions.  If you want to check the operation of IP telephony data with minimal expenses, then the easiest way is to buy a monthly subscription to the cloud service. <br>  If you want a stationary solution, then the choice of a hardware PBX will surely justify itself. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/140726/">https://habr.com/ru/post/140726/</a></p>
