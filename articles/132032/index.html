  <section class="page js-page"><h1>PayPal or "Pay, my friend"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I want to share with you the story of one amusing dispute in PayPal.  For those who do not know, ‚Äúdispute‚Äù is a situation where a misunderstanding arose between the seller and the buyer and PayPal becomes an intermediary, trying to figure out which side is true (and if it is simpler, then ‚Äúwho will get the money‚Äù). <br><br>  I have several electronic stores selling icons.  It should be noted that icons are one of the types of downloaded ‚Äúdigital goods‚Äù, which, by definition, cannot be covered by the ‚Äúpossibility of return‚Äù.  (I remember the old joke ‚Äúcan I upload an unnecessary file back to the Internet?‚Äù) I provided that this could cause confusion among individual customers, and made a special clause in the ‚Äúuser agreement‚Äù that everyone who buys is obliged to accept.  In order to avoid a certain type of comments, I will not give links to stores;  Believe on the word, icons of high quality and with the "desire to return" I have never come across. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Last week, I received an email from PayPal saying that a customer had expressed a desire to get money back.  According to PayPal, in fact, he ‚Äúdid not think to pay,‚Äù ‚Äúeverything happened by chance‚Äù and so on (hereinafter I will give a free translation of the correspondence).  A PayPal employee reported an open dispute and asked me to provide proof that "the goods were delivered to the buyer."  (PayPal, obviously only discovers the existence of virtual goods (yes, it sounds like nonsense; then this nonsense will thicken) and the whole discussion is conducted in terms of sending physical goods by post).

      The amount of the order was small, but I decided not to let things go on the brakes, noting for myself that this could be an unhealthy precedent.  In addition, the buyer‚Äôs explanations (according to PayPal) sounded more than strange (‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know‚Äù, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt think‚Äù).  I provided the necessary information about the time of payment, as well as about the fact of downloading the file (the person ‚Äúdid not want to buy‚Äù, but the file was regularly downloaded).  I added a detailed description of the nature of the goods to the documents confirming the above, and referred to the ‚Äúuser agreement‚Äù <br><br>  A few days later the dispute was resolved.  To my sincere surprise, the money was returned to the buyer, completely ignoring my evidence and arguments.  I have not received any explanation of what happened.  Only the verdict and the ability to respond by writing.  It did not solve anything, but it was something of a ‚Äúmatter of honor‚Äù. <br><br>  I wrote in support of PayPal.  He once again outlined the situation and expressed his frustration that this approach to business legitimizes the theft of files.  One can imagine that any unclean person can thus ‚Äúbuy goods‚Äù and get his money back.  Given that PayPal frankly spits on the rights of the seller, licenses and user agreements, this may become (if it has not yet become) a wide practice. <br><br>  In parallel, I wrote to my "suspicious buyer."  He told me that I was humanely hurt that someone could do such tricks.  And that I am happy for him and his dexterity, but I do not consider it acceptable. <br><br>  In response, I received two very amazing letters.  The buyer (and the buyer is a fairly well-known American designer) apologized, said that he himself was surprised that PayPal decided to return him the money for the icons he bought and use with pleasure.  Moreover: within an hour he sent me the amount of the purchase directly.  No comments. <br><br>  PayPal responded in the usual manner for Western elephants "we understand that you are upset, but ..." To the answer, they attached a number of tips that they thought would help me "to continue not to encounter such situations."  (On their part, it would be honest to write: ‚ÄúIf you do not want such situations, do not trade in digital goods with our help,‚Äù but they, of course, wrote something else.) <br><br>  So, funny tips from PayPal: <br>  1. The best solution would be to write the file to physical media (CD / DVD). <br>  2. Send the disk with the file within seven days from the date of payment. <br>  3. Ensure that the shipping method includes a tracking number and proof of delivery to the recipient. <br><br>  After reading this, I did not know whether to laugh or cry.  Even if you imagine that I took their "advice" seriously ... It will kill my business.  I myself often buy downloadable goods on the Internet.  And if I had a chance to read: ‚Äúpay now (by adding at least $ 30 for delivery) and get your three megabytes in just ... seven days.  On the disk, ‚ÄùI would have twisted my finger at my temple and left this site.  Forever and ever. <br><br>  For those who have already moved away from the state of "facepalm".  In the West, where PayPal is operating, its honest Skolkovo has long been built.  Spaceships ply the Silicon Valley.  Innovations and climb from all holes.  But the files (it turns out) still need to be sent to donkeys.  To be more reliable. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/132032/">https://habr.com/ru/post/132032/</a></p>
