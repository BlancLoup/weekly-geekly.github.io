Completely free for 2 months.  The so-called ‚ÄúTry &amp; Buy‚Äù system.  I tried, if you liked it - buy it. <br><br>  Since there is no zomboyaschik in my room for a very long time, and its role is played by a TV tuner connected to a computer that catches 12-15 channels with a creak, I decided to try this service as a replacement for the tuner.  Fortunately, everything is free.  The only thing I missed then was not clarifying whether this service works on a computer.  And in vain ...

    <a name="habracut"></a>  On the appointed day and time, the fitter entered my apartment, <s>during a parade</s> in uniform, with a skein of vitukha and a black box. <br>  - Where is your computer and where is the TV, which we will connect?  - Asked the installer. <br>  ‚ÄúWe will connect the computer,‚Äù I replied. <br>  - And you can connect only a TV.  And only one.  - the assembler stunned by the answer <br>  Here are those on ... Well, telly, so telly.  Showing parental tv. <br>  The installer in a few minutes pulls the wire from the computer to the TV, crimps the wires and connects the equipment. <br><br>  It took only about 10 minutes, and now I am the happy owner of digital TV. <br><br>  I filled out all the papers, the installer showed the basic functionality and left. <br>  Claims to connect - no.  The only thing that I didn‚Äôt like very much was communication with the client on ‚Äúyou‚Äù.  But that's another story. <br><br>  So, he left, and I began to deal with a new toy. <br><br><h2>  Equipment </h2><br><br>  <strong>Prefix</strong> <br>  I got the console with the recording function of <strong>Cisco CIS430 IP-TV STB with HDD</strong> , Dark Gray color with <strong>D-Link DES1005D switch</strong> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/723/5ad/5fe/7235ad5fe1e9d169efa404204f841bf5.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://www.ljplus.ru/img4/l/_/l_d_z/IMG_7217.JPG"><br><br>  The back of the console with the HDD looks like this: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b51/885/e40/b51885e40f21423f0cd59d2447b6da3a.jpg"><br>  Standard "tulips", HDTV output, power, USB-port and others. <br><br>  In addition to the prefix with the recording function, there is a prefix without a hard disk, which, in this regard, does not support some of the functions, but is cheaper: when renting and when buying. <br><br>  Externally, you can compare the console in the illustration from the user manual: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e9c/7fa/dfd/e9c7fadfd05ea57fccfb8e61772fea69.jpg"><br>  In my opinion, superficially, the console without HDD looks much more modern and stylish. <br><br>  Comparative table of the functionality of consoles (on <a href="">the Beeline website in</a> more detail): <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/116/668/916/116668916536c808de0700b98c633201.jpg"><br>  Connect the console through the switch to the Internet and through the "tulips" to the TV. <br>  Accordingly, in order to watch this digital TV, you need to switch the TV to AV or HDMI mode and already there switch channels on the set-top box. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2b8/f09/024/2b8f09024bb892feac65208a973b15a7.jpg"><br>  <strong>Remote</strong> - it is quite convenient, understandable.  Nice green and red button illumination.  Comfortable shape, pleasantly in the hand. <br><br>  <strong>The control interface has</strong> left a very pleasant impression - everything is very beautiful, comfortable, understandable.  Clearly well thought out and worked out.  All controls are made in the colors of corporate colors Beeline. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/18a/2f8/163/18a2f8163619ca5057e09e1379db4726.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/efe/fff/2a2/efefff2a2ee6472263e01916ba7534e7.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/239/be3/e22/239be3e22baab9f110fc8a93349f6071.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/04c/def/4a7/04cdef4a7f796cf112352d08c0b7e05e.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/69e/671/412/69e671412b7c8082e48b3d72d5906b81.jpg"><br>  The schedule of programs is made in the style reminiscent of Google Calendar - in the form of a time line, which is very convenient and clearly displays the grid of programs. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f6b/64b/5b5/f6b64b5b5a67b5c88eb117a6ed04e0a5.jpg"><br>  During channel switching, an information part appears at the bottom of the screen, showing: channel number, channel name, name of the current program, time until it ends, and the name of the next program. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a8a/9cc/ccc/a8a9ccccc420c565d9330ff74ba8c321.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Functional </h2><br>  Here is the main functionality of the console (I have a prefix with the recording function): <br><br><ol><li>  Record TV programs, both by pressing the record button, and on a schedule.  Can record multiple programs at once.  Recorded programs, as written in the instructions, cannot be transferred to a computer.  I have not tried, so I can not say anything about it. </li><li>  Pause, rewind in real time (i.e., go to the toilet, pause, return - turn on) </li><li>  The function "Picture in Picture" - while watching one channel, you can see what is going on through other channels. </li><li>  Online schedule for all connected channels. </li><li>  Countdown to the end of the program you are viewing. </li><li>  The possibility of buying "Movies to order."  Those.  choose a movie in the catalog, buy a viewing and watch it during the day, at least until blue.  Average price - 50 p.  for the film.  In the catalog, basically, not the most hit films, but you can find something interesting.  Part - for free.  Mostly, this Soviet films </li><li>  View directly through the TV information from Yandex: weather, traffic jams and more.  And also - the state of the account. </li><li>  Channel lock settings </li><li>  The remote can be ‚Äútaught‚Äù to control the TV, dvd-player, audio system and anything.  The main thing - to "teach."  Instructions for "training" - attached </li><li>  HDMI output support </li></ol><br><br>  I did not have the opportunity to evaluate the quality of HDTV, due to my lack of a suitable TV.  Therefore, I will not be able to give any comments on this subject. <br><br><h2>  pros </h2><br>  So, among the advantages we have: <br><ol><li>  A large number of channels, the composition and number of which varies depending on the <a href="">tariff</a> </li><li> Functional control of broadcasting in real time (recording, rewind, pause) </li><li>  The possibility of buying movies from the catalog. </li><li>  TV schedule for all channels </li><li>  HDTV </li></ol><br><br><h2>  Minuses </h2><br>  And among the cons: <br><ol><li>  Connect to one console can only TV.  And only one.  Even if you manage to connect several, they will all show the same thing.  Those.  2 TVs - 2 consoles.  Computer - in the span.  Those.  There is no question of replacing the TV tuner. </li><li>  Separate remote.  Even taking into account the possibility of training in the management of other equipment, this is not the best solution for me.  The number of consoles is already starting to scare. </li><li>  Separate switch.  Ie TV only works through it.  And now I have a pyramid of routers on my desk: my Asus WL-500G, and on top is this D-Link.  But the most annoying thing is that in both of them, half of the ports are empty.  I tried to connect the TV directly through my router.  To no avail.  TV works only 5-10 seconds, and then the picture hangs.  The sound is coming, there is no picture.  Understand the reasons was too lazy.  I repent.  It can somehow be set up, but this could not be done from the "summer". </li><li>  2 additional occupied sockets: switch and set-top box.  In the light of the fact that even without them, my 8-socket power strip already struggles with the number of ‚Äúplugs‚Äù that want it, then the extra ‚Äúmouths‚Äù occupied the last free sockets. </li><li>  The dimensions and weight of the console are healthy and heavy - 4.5 kg - with HDD, 1 kg - without HDD. </li><li>  Work only through the AV or HDMI mode on the TV. </li></ol><br><br>  Thus, my first priority is to replace the TV tuner - this service does not solve. <br><br><h2>  Disappointment </h2><br>  If you can not be through a computer, we will watch through the TV. <br>  I watched, watched and played with new buns all evening, but after a few hours I realized that there was nothing in it that would make me connect this service for money. <br><br>  Yes, <strong>many channels</strong> .  But, as BOR said recently, ‚ÄúThe more channels there are on TV, the longer it takes you to understand that there is nothing interesting anyway.‚Äù  After a couple of hours in front of the screen, I fully realized this. <br><br>  Yes, <strong>convenient broadcast control functionality</strong> .  But how often will I use it?  Now, if I missed something, I can easily find everything I need in the record on the Internet.  Even if it takes a little more time and it is not so convenient. <br><br>  Yes, the <strong>schedule of transfers to ALL channels</strong> .  But I hardly need a schedule for all 125 channels.  From strength, 2‚Äì3 main channels, whose schedule can still be found on the same Yandex. <br><br>  <strong>So what do we get in the end?</strong> <br>  Monthly fee from 95 p.  over 50 channels up to 495 p.  for 125 channels (plus, there are additional channel packages) <br>  + rental prefixes from 190r.  per month for the console without HDD, and 230r.  - for installation from HDD <br>  or buying a console - 6500r.  or 7950r. <br><br>  <strong>Total:</strong> <br>  1. Minimum: 285r.  per month for 50 channels (90% of which are received by a full-time television antenna in Moscow), without the recording function. <br>  2. Maximum: 725r.  per month for 125 channels with recording function.  (excluding additional packages) <br><br>  Personally for myself, I did not find any special need to connect this service.  And even more so, buy a prefix.  But this is my personal opinion, which I do not impose on anyone. <br>  Maybe there are people for whom everything described will be for happiness. <br><br>  Therefore, the very next day I wrote a letter to the support service with wishes, descriptions of all the problems I encountered, and also asking me to take this equipment away from me, since  I refuse test connection. <br><br>  The answer came the next day.  Below is a quote from the letter: <br><br><blockquote>  Answering your question, we want to inform you that there is no possibility to return the set-top box via courier.  To resolve the issue, it is enough to bring IPTV equipment to the address: Moscow, Kurskaya metro station, ul.  Zemlyanoy Val, house 20, p. 3, strictly on weekdays from 10.00 to 19.00, tel .: 782‚Äì3222.  Office open: Mon-Fri from 10.00 - 19.00 <br></blockquote><br><br>  Wonderful! <br>  Oddly enough, but I also work strictly on weekdays.  And also strictly from 10.00 to 19.00.  Now I am waiting for my May holiday in order to take their equipment to them, since  I am not a sadist to send my wife with a box weighing more than 5 kg to go to their office on a weekday.  And to take time off from work does not allow high workload. <br><br>  Thus, we add <strong>another big one</strong> <strong>to the piggy bank</strong> : you will have to ask for time off from work and go on weekdays from 10.00 to 19.00 to bring their equipment to them independently, if for some reason you are not satisfied with the Digital TV service. <br><br>  <strong>The result of this whole story is:</strong> <br>  The ‚ÄúDigital TV from Beeline‚Äù service provides quite high-quality broadcasting, a wide choice of channels, and equipment for various needs, from simple channel viewing to advanced broadcast control functionality. <br><br>  But this service has a number of drawbacks that can alienate potential customers.  Among them: <br>  The ability to connect only ONE TV. <br>  The inability to connect television through a computer. <br>  The presence of additional equipment for connecting services, some of which are in doubt about the need (additional switch in the presence of its own router). <br><br>  And the customer‚Äôs equipment return system leaves a not very pleasant impression of the company: ‚ÄúWe brought it, hooked it up, and if you don‚Äôt like it, go back with your own return, this is not our problem.‚Äù <br><br>  For this, I want to take a bow, my first post in 2 years is readonly on Habr√© on this. <br>  I would be glad if someone helped determine the decision to connect this service. <br><br>  PS Advise in what blog this post to determine? <br><br>  UPD: Nobody advised anything, transferred to IP-TV. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/90048/">https://habr.com/ru/post/90048/</a></p>
