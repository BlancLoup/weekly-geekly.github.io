  <section class="page js-page"><h1>SmartProgress: Elephant Hunt</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The big elephant is eaten piece by piece.  This rather well-known metaphor from the book of Gleb Arkhangelsky, says that to any global goal leads the way from the n-nn number of small steps.  This is not to say that this idea is original (to some extent, it is present in many books on time management, the same Covey and his ‚Äúsharpening saw‚Äù or Allen‚Äôs Getting Things Done and his flight at an altitude of 30 or 50 thousand miles) this idea is no less correct.  Let's do it again: a big elephant is eaten piece by piece. <br><br>  Why I focus on this.  I do not think that the majority of those gathered in these profile blogs see this truth for the first time.  However, one thing is to know, another thing is to have a convenient tool for cutting carcasses.  But more on that later.  In the meantime, a little bit of theory. <br><br>  So, to begin with about the correct goal setting. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e76/95b/38a/e7695b38a6e6daa95e4173340894e580.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The goal must be achievable (otherwise it is a dream) and measurable.  Those.  There is no such goal ‚Äúto learn English.‚Äù  It is unattainable in principle.  You can reach the Advanced level, expand your vocabulary to a certain number of active words (there are services that allow you to calculate it), and so on.  Those.  The last two options are achievable and measurable goals.  And the first is a poorly worded dream or desire.  Similarly, there are no goals to "lose weight", "go in for sports", "defeat procrastination" and "get rich" because  they are immeasurable.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/286/ab2/7f3/286ab27f395fb759ef446097c20cca8e.jpg"><br><br>  But the task "to accumulate 500 thousand rubles for two years" is the goal.  And a very good, easily measurable goal.  Most importantly, it is easily chopped into pieces and can start to be fulfilled right now.  And ‚Äúget a certificate for ...  insert to taste "is also much better divided into subtasks and executed than the faceless" to learn such a programming language. " <br><br>  Now how this purpose is executed.  The same Allen in its concept of GTD teaches that any action consisting of more than two actions should be considered a separate project.  And start your own folder, section or something else in the same spirit.  Now, regularly looking through the list of our affairs, we will see our Goal (exactly, with a capital letter), and understand whether we are moving towards it or not.  If not, then you can always plan another small step that you can do today.  For example, to postpone 20 thousand from the salary on the deposit.  Or buy a book on a programming language right now. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/76b/027/b2f/76b027b2f6259318d04f2dea598c9d48.jpg"><br><br>  And finally, on the way to the goal, it is very important for us to see progress.  To understand that we are not standing still, but moving.  Let slowly, but constantly.  And here, when we figured out how to set a goal, the first place is the instrument with which we will divide, kick, and, most importantly, track this goal.  After all, we are techies, which means, like no one else, we understand that a properly selected tool is, if not half the story, then a significant part of it.  I will show goal setting on the example of the <a href="https://smartprogress.do/">SmartProgress goal achievement</a> service (after all, this is a corporate blog, by the way, thank you for being with us), but you can use any of the usual methods or use the similar English-language service <a href="http://www.43things.com/">43things.com</a> . <br><br>  So, add a goal.  For example, ‚Äúsave up 500 thousand rubles‚Äù.  Immediately write the description: Accumulate 500 thousand rubles by February 1, 2015. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1f2/fd1/290/1f2fd12903f87b863d0f8109bb1d1aa6.png"><br><br>  Now we divide the goal into stages.  For example: <br>  1. To postpone 60 thousand for the first quarter of 2013; <br>  2. Find and put money on deposit for two years at 11% per annum.  The contribution must be replenished and with interest capitalization; <br>  3. To postpone 60 thousand rubles for the second quarter of 2013; <br>  And so on‚Ä¶ <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b86/32a/2ce/b8632a2ce9751ec28a35800d745f1a4b.png"><br><br>  And the last - we set the final date of execution of the goal and the appropriate category.  At the same time, you can choose whether to make the goal public or open only for yourself or only for friends.  The first and third can be useful if you need advice on how best to achieve the goal.  Secondly, if you are afraid of possible painful interference from the outside.  In any case, the choice is yours.  The only thing is that in the case of a closed goal you will not be able to get advice and will not receive support from friends.  In any case, no one bothers to set public goals (for example, certification in a programming language), where your friends will regularly ‚Äúkick‚Äù you for possible laziness and personal closed goals - those very intimate ones that you can‚Äôt even admit to yourself. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8f7/dc4/403/8f7dc440301e83068cdf580a7f48a2dd.png"><br><br>  And finally, the last.  When the goal is formed, she has a diary.  The very place where you can mark the execution of stages, look at the progressively filling progress bar. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/021/d95/846/021d95846478ef5ef935c8c098c41f9c.png"><br><br>  And, most importantly, add records, photos and just memorabilia.  All that you can be proud of, looking at the accomplishment of the goal.  For example, a screenshot of the first deposit from online banking, or scan certificate for training. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/224/668/9b0/2246689b0825628de01b74165b4dd5fa.png"><br><br>  With our goal over.  It's time to see what other users are dreaming about.  As statistics SmartPtogress shows, people most often set goals related to business or finance, study and personal growth. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f41/406/98a/f4140698ab4bfdc1012aa04019e421c0.png"><br><br>  And in which category is your goal? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/166681/">https://habr.com/ru/post/166681/</a></p>
