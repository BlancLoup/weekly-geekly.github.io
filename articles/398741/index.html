In 2016, we launched several <a href="http://comfortway.com/partners/">Partner programs</a> that are focused on different IT / Telecom niches and are conceptually built in several directions - the industry as a whole, sales, projects, the Internet.  Today we will tell about our vision of partnership with different categories of companies and about the structure of the global Partnership program ComfortWay. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The main value of our solutions and <a href="http://comfortway.com/technologies/">technologies</a> for partners is that a partner gets access to the Internet for its products and solutions, or expands the capabilities of such a component and complements it with the magic of ComfortWay.  For example, for MVNO, integration with the platform and the installation of a java-applet on the operator's SIM card will enable the operator to offer its subscribers.  In the next posts we will try to tell in detail the values ‚Äã‚Äãof partnership with us for all categories of potential partners, including those partners who will help us sell our solutions. <br><br><h3>  Industrial partners </h3><br>  <u>Virtual Operators |</u>  <u>MVNO PARTNER</u> <br>  This level of participation is focused on virtual operators who have already built a network and are ready to give their users additional value through a selection of various operators and coverage around the world through several minor technological changes and integration with <a href="http://comfortway.com/technologies/">the ComfortWay platform</a> .  In this category, and mobile operators, but the partnership with them is multifaceted and we will tell about it later.

      <u>Wearable Device Manufacturers |</u>  <u>VENDOR PARTNER</u> <br>  The level is promising for manufacturers of wearable devices, smartphones, tablets, who are planning to use eSIM technology or pre-install SIM cards with ComfortWay software.  Pre-installation will make the device ready to work in 140 countries around the world.  We are already ready to transfer our technology to the eSIM vendor for joint development and it will gain independence from mobile operators. <br><br><h3>  Sales </h3><br>  In this direction, we are looking for heroes and divided all potential partners into two categories - those who help us build partner networks in the location and those who sell <a href="http://comfortway.com/sim-card/">CwSim</a> . <br><br>  <u>Representative |</u>  <u>AGENT</u> <br>  Partner in the local region, ready to work to expand the company's presence through a partner network and work on building a network of partners. <br><br>  <u>Reseller |</u>  <u>RESELLER</u> <br>  This level of participation in the program is optimal for points of sale, chain stores or online stores that plan to expand the product line with innovative products. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/484/af3/670/484af367027e4505ae17ab8712b178a8.png"></div><br><br><h3>  Project partners </h3><br>  Affiliate programs for these categories of potential development partners, but we already see great interest in them from the market. <br><br>  <u>Integrator |</u>  <u>FMC PARTNER</u> <br>  The level of participation in the Affiliate Program will help fixed-line operators and broadband access providers or developers of virtual PBXs.  We will build with the partner additional value in the integration of fixed and mobile communications. <br><br>  <u>Corporate Partner |</u>  <u>CORPORATE PARTNER</u> <br>  The ComfortWay technology allows for several months to launch its own virtual operator for internal corporate use or for company clients.  We will jointly produce the required number of branded SIM-cards and deploy the operator control system.  We can also modify the functionality of a corporate virtual network before using local tariffs in other countries.  The role of ComfortWay in partnership is MVNA or MVNE.  If we talk about the situation around MVNO, then recently the network announced the launch of ‚Äúfor itself‚Äù Domodedovo Airport and for its customers two giants - VKontakte and Sberbank. <br><br>  <u>Internet of Things |</u>  <u>IOT / M2M PARTNER</u> <br>  For device manufacturers, IoT management services - integrate <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/comfortway/blog/280726/">ComfortWay technologies</a> into your solutions and teach your users to manage the world of things around with one click and at the best prices. <br><br>  <u>Device Manufacturers |</u>  <u>CONNECTED CARS PARTNER</u> <br>  Our potential partners, suppliers of solutions for transport companies, delivery services or taxis in the form of a joint car access solution to the Internet ( <a href="http://www.bmw.com/com/en/insights/technology/connecteddrive/2013/connectivity_technologies/index.html">BMW case</a> ) will help optimize the offer to your customers by optimizing the cost of the access component. <br><br>  <u>Independent software developers |</u>  <u>OEM PARTNER</u> <br>  Mobile application developers who are ready to integrate ComfortWay functionality into applications.  The partner is provided with a developer SDK and comprehensive support from our Development Center.  In this format of partnership, your application acquires the most important component - communication. <br><br>  <u>Security Solutions |</u>  <u>SECURITY PARTNER</u> <br>  To whom?  Security solution providers willing to integrate their solutions into ComfortWay products to provide secure access to the Internet or access to corporate networks and clouds.  For example, we are currently negotiating with a leading security company about setting up access through their VPN. <br><br><h3>  the Internet </h3><br>  The key value of the ComfortWay platform is that we have learned to integrate with third-party Internet services that provide services for travelers ‚Äî bookings, car sharing, insurance, travel planners, guides.  As a result of such integrations, we give ComfortWay users free internet.  <a href="http://comfortway.com/loyalty/">Affiliate on the Internet</a> is built and have time! <br><br><h3>  <a href="http://comfortway.com/">Become a partner</a> </h3><br><br>  Previous publications by the author - <br>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/evseyfaydo/topics/">Habrahabr</a> <br>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/evseyfaydo/topics/">Geektimes</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/398741/">https://habr.com/ru/post/398741/</a></p>
