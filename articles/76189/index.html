  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Transfer server from Russia to Germany</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It so happens that for about three years I place my server in the <a href="http://infobox.ru/">Infobox</a> - in terms of the price / quality ratio, this provider is at a fairly high level in Russia.  At least, earlier there it was possible to install your server in the case of the type ‚ÄúTower‚Äù for 2500 rubles per month, now for 3000 rubles per month. <br>  But still, 3000 rubles for hosting <b>your</b> server is a bit expensive, considering that the server needs to be bought and maintained independently.  After Infobox raised prices from 2500 to 3000 rubles per month, it became especially obvious and forced to search for alternatives. <br>  On Habr√©, a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hosting/52317/">good article was</a> discovered on the rental of servers outside the Russian Federation, and assessing the possible options, I stopped at <a href="http://www.serverloft.com/">serverloft</a> , where the server was rented in the glorious city of Frankfurt. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  So, for $ 99 (~ 2900 rub.) I ordered a server with this configuration: <br><br>  Fujitsu PRIMERGY RX330 on Serverworks HT2100 plus HT1000 chipset <br>  AMD Opteron 2344HE, Quad-Core processor, 1 pc. <br>  RAM 4 GB DDR2-667 ECC Registered <br>  HDD 250 GB 7200 RPM, 2 pieces + hardware RAID + Hot-Swap <br>  Traffic 5000 GB, 100 MBit Switchport, Backbone 110 GBit <br>  100 GB of space for backup <br>  4 ipshnik

      He paid with a credit card (Visa Gold), accepted without problems and did not require any supporting documents. <br>  After ordering came the following letter: <br><br><blockquote>  Your order with SERVERLOFT (setup delay) <br><br>  Dear Michael, <br><br>  Thank you for your order with SERVERLOFT.  We have received your order for the PerfectServer L 1.5 (EU) server. <br><br>  Unfortunately, we are not able to process your order at this time. <br>  There is a delay in the new hardware delivery. <br>  We expect new PerfectServer L 1.5 (EU) servers to be available within the next 10-20 working days again. <br><br>  It is acceptable for you. <br>  We can also offer you our partner companies. <br><br>  Thank you very much for your patience and understanding. <br><br>  If you have any questions, please contact us directly at 1.314.266.4302 or visit our Live Chat at <a href="http://www.serverloft.com/">www.serverloft.com</a> <br><br>  - We look forward to your response. <br><br>  Kind regards <br>  Your SERVERLOFT - Sales Team </blockquote><br>  I was not in a hurry, because  the server in Infobox was paid for another month, but I still thought :) <br>  The next day, a Serverloft support staff member called from the States and said that the servers had arrived and the installation would be today.  As a matter of fact, it was so - on the same day the server was installed. <br>  Speed ‚Äã‚Äãand ping pleasantly pleased.  Installation of the system is done through their panel, a fairly convenient procedure - you choose an axis and after 15 minutes it is already installed. <br>  By the way, the control panel itself is very convenient - everything is very logical. <br>  Of interesting points: the traffic is summed up, i.e.  incoming and outgoing traffic is considered, and this amount should not exceed 5 TB / month.  In principle, 5 TB is a lot even for file storage, and for ordinary sites with an average attendance this is more than enough with a huge margin. <br><br>  According to impressions, so far - like day and night, especially with regard to the level of service and competence of the support service.  It seems as if he moved from a student dormitory to a five-star hotel :) <br><br>  It seems that all the interesting moments told, if you have any questions - ask, I will answer. <br>  You can admire the speed, for example, <a href="http://re-hash.ru/">here</a> (the site opens at about the same speed as if it were in the Russian Federation). <br><br>  PS By the way, such a question to knowledgeable people: if my server is located in Germany, then does the legislation apply to it already German?  I mean primarily content and services like hosting that require a license in the Russian Federation. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/76189/">https://habr.com/ru/post/76189/</a></p>
