There are not enough promotion skills, not banal ‚Äúwe will advance to the top 10‚Äù, but the ability to create an adventure for tens of thousands of people, such an adventure, so that it would be interesting to come back so that you would like to share with others ...

      If you have been through this and can share your advice, they are waiting for you under the cut :) <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  A year ago I came up with the Naked King (www.nakedking.ru) - a site where you can share your story about work.  He began with attempts to reach the immense, he came up with a functional a decade ahead, half embodied.  In the first month after the launch, he took a big sledgehammer and began to ‚Äúput out‚Äù the unnecessary.  Out of 7 tabs, I left three, killed a couple of clouds, polls and a whole bunch of other things that, in theory, were interesting, but in practice, garbage.  If I rewrote the project from scratch, I would have done it in a third of the time and a third of the budget :). <br><br>  Having solved technical issues, I realized that the complete ignoramus was in conquering the masses.  Despite the success of the experiment with VKontakte, where I found 450 friends and first authors, ‚Äútargeted spam‚Äù took a huge amount of time and was an unproductive waste of time.  The real alternative (and much more economical) was the use of freelancers for minor tasks (VKontakte, classmates, forums, posting articles on other sites with links to the King).  Thanks to this, I got a steady organic growth.  According to my calculations, at the current pace in less than 80 years, the King will catch up with leading sites in the audience.  Oops. <br><br>  There are three solutions to the problem: <br>  1. Learn and do it yourself <br>  2. Hire a freelancer <br>  3. Find a partner <br><br>  Really appreciating the progress in advancement - we delete the first option.  Working with freelancers greatly simplifies and speeds up the process, but never leads to a breakthrough, boring promotion will give a boring product.  The difference between partnerships is that both are in the game, there is no expectation that someone will give you a task, and you will simply accomplish it.  Of course, a whole stratum of things arises with a partner that you didn‚Äôt have to think about while you were working alone (assessing the contribution of each, ownership structure, vesting, etc.), but the advantages of the right partner outweigh the disadvantages of additional restrictions. <br><br>  For sure.  Each start-up faced the problem of ‚Äúmaking oneself or finding a partner‚Äù.  Of course, each of us is a super genius and can learn Chinese overnight, but how to determine when it is more effective to find a partner than to try to do everything yourself? <br><br>  Did you work with a partner? <br>  What were the pros and cons? <br>  What you need to think, to agree at the very beginning? <br><br>  PS If you know how to create adventures and are looking for where to put your strength - write me on king (at) nakedking.ru </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/28657/">https://habr.com/ru/post/28657/</a></p>
