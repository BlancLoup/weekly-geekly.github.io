In the future, this trend will push other players to use these and similar platforms, which may be called independent due to the transparency of their functionality and available inventory.  It is this transparency that will push to reduce the number of intermediaries connecting the links of the advertiser to the final consumer of advertising and content.  This term is now called <i>disintermediation.</i> <br><br>  Next year will appear before advertisers as a period of need to reorient their own priorities regarding advertising channels as such, as well as cultivating their own primary base across sites.  With additional options in the platforms, there are much greater opportunities for data collection, targeting through various platforms and experimenting with the fundamental components of the advertising parameters of the ads themselves.  All this will help to achieve even greater efficiency from the introduction of a mobile advertising channel on various devices of your consumers. <br><br>  <b>2) Ad blocking</b> <br><br>  In 2016, advertisers will get tired of being exposed to the constant risks of possible blocking of advertising content - whereas in applications users cannot block it.  And to monitor every show, by clicking on such an advertisement, is simple.  It will take several more quarters, and then, in a crisis, everyone will focus a large part of the budget on advertising that cannot be blocked by the user, on advertising that you can get statistics on at any second. <br><br>  <b>3) Tracking user on different devices</b> <br><br>  In the market of cross-device tracking, it is not yet possible to identify a prominent leader.  However, that is why advertisers are forced to seek a lever between a competent combination between the primary data from the sites and the independent data of the advertisers themselves.  However, it is expected that in these disagreements a bridge will finally be built, optimizing the interaction of data and information, which in turn will simplify even more the work with the platform itself. <br><br>  <b>4) Transparency</b> <br><br>  Both advertisers and publishers strive to achieve greater transparency in the use of programmatic features.  Any advertiser wants to see specifics, namely: how profitable are his investments, to get access to data for a thorough analysis of the types of advertising for a particular campaign, which in turn is considered the most successful in the inventory used. <br>  2016 is the year in which transparency will acquire the status of ‚Äúmust-have‚Äù instead of the current and usual ‚Äúpleasant addition‚Äù, and the programmatic itself should be prepared for advertisers inquiries about receiving as well as simple data such as the number of clicks, impressions, etc., and settings platforms for targeting, excess optimization, fine tuning for GEO and other details. <br><br>  <b>5) High-quality advertising</b> <br><br>  In 2016, popular types of advertising will change over time.  More focus will be on the experience of the users themselves, on the analytics of the conducted advertising campaigns, advertisers, at the same time, will be able to quickly adapt to consumers and modify advertising content, to the extent that video and native advertising on mobile devices can become even better and more profitable. to attract the user to the advertised product with the highest conversion rates. <br><br> <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/register/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dcontent_marketing"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/041/3c5/29a/0413c529a1424210a02b160e54a40e80.png"></a> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg">BYYD ‚Ä¢ Mobile Advertising Platform</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296704/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296704/</a></p>
