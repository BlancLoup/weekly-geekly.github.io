If you are a novice specialist, and do not know where to start studying <i>Android</i> , or if you already have some knowledge in this topic and plan to get a job soon, then this material is for you.  As planned, you will return to this article as you gain experience: to look at what stage you are at the moment and what to study further. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <font color="#073b5d">How it all began</font> </h2><br>  In the field of system administration, I have successfully worked for more than two years.  Having studied the <a href="https://rabota.yandex.ru/salary%3Ftext%3D%25D0%25A1%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9%2520%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%26rid%3D213">market,</a> I realized that I need to go further and change something.  My interest in technology grew and I focused on programming, namely, in <i>Java</i> .  I started learning <i>Java SE</i> from scratch.  The plan was complete immersion in <i>Java SE</i> , and then in <i>Java EE</i> .  But, in the middle of learning <i>Java SE</i> , I launched the usual Hello World project on <i>Android</i> .  And my views on the future have changed a lot.  The entire journey from the first ‚Äúimmersion‚Äù to the program to the job offer took 1 year. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#073b5d">To be or not to be?</font> </h2><br>  The choice of <i>Android</i> needs to be thought out well, as it walks by leaps and bounds.  Every year a new version is consistently released, with many innovations.  In addition, a certain percentage of existing applications on the new version may not even start.  You have to solve these problems. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#073b5d">What language can be developed for Android</font> </h2><br>  1. Officially, <i>Google</i> provided two options.

    <ul><li>  <i>Android SDK</i> .  Official languages ‚Äã‚Äãare <i>Java</i> and <i>Kotlin</i> . <br>  Most existing projects are written in <i>Java</i> . <br>  <i><a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/277479/">Kotlin</a></i> is a grandson of <i>Java</i> .  Some developers began to actively use it in their projects.  <i>(But they are not so many compared to Java)</i> <br>  <i>Android</i> <a href="https://developer.android.com/kotlin/index.html">officially began to support Kotlin from 05/17/2017</a> , the language features will be built into Android Studio 3.0. </li></ul><br><ul><li>  <i>Android NDK</i> .  The official languages ‚Äã‚Äãare <i>C / C ++</i> . <br>  Google itself <a href="https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/index.html">recommends</a> using NDK in cases where maximum performance is required.  (In one of our projects, we used NDK to organize voice communications) <br></li></ul><br><br>  2. There are also <a href="http://techmas.ru/blog/instrumentyi-razrabotki-mobilnyih-prilozheniy/">cross-platform tools</a> . <br><br><h2>  <font color="#073b5d">How to start learning Android</font> </h2><br>  Perhaps you paid attention to <i>cross-platform tools</i> or <i>Kotlin</i> , but you should not hurry. <br><br>  C using <i>cross-platform tools</i> can be developed immediately and under <i>Android</i> and <i>iOS</i> . <br><br>  <i>Cross-platform tools</i> are able to solve a certain range of tasks, but in terms of flexibility they can never be compared with native solutions.  Moreover, such specialists are not much in demand in the labor market. <br><br>  As for <i>Kotlin</i> , today there are no companies that have absolutely all Android projects written on it.  It seems to me that <i>Kotlin</i> should be studied only after employment. <br><br>  I recommend starting with <i>Java</i> .  Especially if you have no programming experience. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#073b5d">Learning Java</font> </h2><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Required knowledge</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><ul><li>  Data types.

I will only address those for which he was engaged. <br><br>  <a href="http://javarush.ru/">1. JavaRush</a> <br><br>  The very first resource for learning was JavaRush.  I think it will be enough to take a free course "Java Syntax", which consists of 10 levels. <br><br><p> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/b6c/be4/4c4/b6cbe44c45264fb3894eaf76ede99bad.PNG"></a> </p><br>  By itself, the resource clearly deserves attention, despite the incorrectness of many tasks and a strongly noticeable flaw in the validator.  Many are skeptical of this service, and believe that you should not waste time on it.  I praise and strongly criticize this resource, like my current colleagues who started with me.  JavaRush will give a good start and well pump the algorithms.  But to stay on it is clearly not worth it. <br><br>  2. <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/golovachcourses/blog/215275/">Java Core by Ivan Head</a> <br><br>  In parallel with JavaRush, I also watched the video lectures of Ivan the Head, which in my opinion are the best in <i>Java</i> in Runet.  Few people nowadays are able to program well and explain well.  These lectures reinforced their knowledge in JavaRush.  <i>I</i> advise to watch lectures on <i>Java Sore</i> completely. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#073b5d">Learning Android</font> </h2><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Required knowledge</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><ul><li>  <i>XML</i> - make up the interfaces will have to be on it </li><li>  <i>Activity / Fragments</i> - "forms" for the location of the UI.

Udacity: Android Basics</a> <br>  After the end of the introductory course on <i>Android</i> , the desire to program has greatly increased.  The course explains most clearly the basic concept of development for <i>Android</i> .  After this course, I wrote my first application - a password generator, preserving the state of the screen during coups. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist%3Flist%3DPLyfVjOYzujugap6Rf3ETNKkx4v9ePllNK">2. Video lectures StartAndroid</a> <br>  A good addition to Udacity has become free video lectures from the resource StartAndroid. <br><br>  I do not recommend watching old lessons (2012-2013 year), because  technology has gone a long way.

Devcolibri - Full Android Application</a> <br>  After completing the course from Udacity, an idea appeared to start writing my first test application.  After a brief search, I found a good course from Devcolibri, where the concept of development was explained on the example of writing the simplest task manager.  Watching this course, I simultaneously started to make my application, picking up various pieces from the lesson. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#073b5d">Technologies and tools for Android Junior</font> </h2><br>  In the <a href="https://t.me/android_ru">community of Android developers in Telegram</a> , there was a question on this topic, my answer was equated as too high for the requirements for Junior.  (I described <i>Retrofit2</i> in conjunction with <i>RxJava</i> , also <i>Dagger2</i> , <i>Realm</i> and <i>Picasso</i> ).  It is worth noting that the level of requirements for Android Junior in almost all studios is different.  Someone recruit and with the <i>initial</i> knowledge of <i>Android</i> , without technology in principle.  But this is rare, and I was not among those lucky ones.  The more you know - the higher your chances of employment. <br><br>  So, let's go: <br><br>  <a href="https://git-scm.com/"><b>1. Git</b></a> <br>  This is a version control system code.  Allows you to actively work in a team, track changes in the code and roll back to previous versions, which is very convenient.  I advise you to take a <a href="https://geekbrains.ru/gitstart">good course</a> from <a href="https://geekbrains.ru/">GeekBrains</a> .  As a Git client, I recommend using <a href="https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/">SourceTree</a> , since  it is completely free and convenient, and studios love to save on software. <br><br>  <a href="http://jakewharton.github.io/butterknife/"><b>2. ButterKnife</b></a> <br>  Convenient library for declaring <i>view</i> elements from <i>XML</i> .  (And not only).  It is studied very quickly and reduces a certain amount of routine code. <br><br>  <b><a href="https://github.com/square/retrofit">3.

(For example, be able to <i>parse JSON</i> with data) <br><br>  You should not dig <i>RxJava</i> from the very beginning.  A significant portion of Android developers use it exclusively in conjunction with Retrofit2. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Useful articles</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  1. <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/314028/">We study Retrofit 2</a> <br>  2. <a href="https://android-school.ru/retrofit-2-%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580%25D1%2583%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC-%25D1%2584%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B9%25D0%25BB%25D1%258B-%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0-%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580/">Retrofit2: Uploading files to the server</a> <br>  3. <a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.com/rxandroid-and-retrofit-2-0-66dc52725fff">Retrofit2 + RxJava + RxAndroid</a> <br></div></div><br>  <a href="https://google.github.io/dagger/"><b>4.

True, in production projects it is still not used as often as  The stable version was released relatively recently.  But, in my opinion, the future of local data storage on <i>Android is</i> precisely for <i>Realm</i> .  Just look at it at the abstract level ‚Äî parse the underlying transactions. <br><br>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/281226/">Comparative characteristics of ORM and databases</a> <br><br>  <a href="http://square.github.io/picasso/"><b>6.

It is worth exploring it, but I would not advise using it in real projects, since  <i>EventBus is</i> very difficult to maintain in the future. <br>  But, in real projects, unfortunately, you will often meet. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#073b5d">Practice</font> </h2><br>  As a rule, candidates with existing applications on <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub have a</a> higher chance of finding a job.  (Especially if they use all the technologies that I have described). <br><br>  To increase the chances of employment, I recommend writing a test application that will consolidate the knowledge gained.  What it should be and what it should do is up to you.  Personally, it seems to me that an indisputable advantage over other candidates will be an application that downloads some data from the network and displays it in a convenient format for the user. <br><br>  At the same time, if the user does not have Internet, the latest data is downloaded from the database.  If you did not find an appropriate API for yourself - it does not matter, create several JSON files on <a href="http://myjson.com/api">this</a> resource and use them.  The look will not be on the usefulness of your application for the world, but on how you implemented it. <br><br>  My application downloaded from the network a list of company managers and showed a schedule for the implementation of sales plans.  Already in the process of its development, I received a job offer. <br><br>  My biggest mistake in the development process of this application - I tried to do everything perfectly.  By standards so that my code is well appreciated.  Having a very abstract knowledge of <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/278769/">MVP</a> , I tried to embed it into a project, thereby confusing my code even more. <br><br>  Make your first application perfect will not work, no matter how you try.  It seems to me that you should not use <i>MVP</i> in your first project if you do not want to confuse yourself even more.  (In the future, after employment - definitely worth it). <br><br>  During development, you may have many questions.  It does not matter if you do not have familiar Android-developers.  Feel free to ask your questions on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">StackOverFlow</a> (available in <a href="http://ru.stackoverflow.com/">Russian</a> ).
