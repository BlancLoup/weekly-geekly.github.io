  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Reserving internet connection</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <i>Communication - it is like air.</i>  <i>Until you spoil, they do not notice her.</i> <br><br>  For a long time, a home Internet connection was considered only as a service-entertainment service.  But with the growth of various services, the entertainment component has decreased quite a lot.  And with the advent of the possibility of remote work, an Internet connection surpassed even regular telephony in need and even managed to get into human rights. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Personally, at home, the Internet connection has evolved quite noticeably, as in the whole country, from a simple dial-up to connecting using ADSL, ethernet, 3G / 4G.  But if the issue of access speed could be solved by communicating with the technical support of the provider, then the user has to decide the reliability issue himself.  It all developed for me in a few steps: An old system unit with a pair of network ones for connecting to an ethernet provider and a home network and for backup, a mobile phone connected via data cable with gprs internet - this option did not last long due to the absence of unlimited or similar tariffs.  At some stage, the home network node looked like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b99/d34/5af/b99d345af222fc76e7d9c079b08a714e.jpg" alt="image">

      Then I started trying backups with the advent of firmware 2.0 for Zyxel Kinetic routers with its ability to connect usb-modem.  However, the real test of this solution did not materialize for several reasons: when connecting as the main provider via the ethernet line, and the backup via GSM-USB modem, everything worked during configuration, but when the backup connection was required, the Internet was often unavailable.  When I began to find out why, it turned out that there were several reasons: <br><br><ul><li>  usb modem could itself disconnect a connection that was not restored by the router on its own, partially this could be solved by a small script in the router, but if the modem itself ‚Äúhung‚Äù it was necessary to distort it. </li><li>  the load on the mobile network if the electricity was turned off not only in my house. </li></ul><br>  I have all the equipment (a communication rack with a router, NAS, test server, laptop) in case of a power outage it can work up to 1.5 hours from uninterruptible power supplies, and if it is necessary for the equipment to continue to work, I can start a small gas generator on the balcony.  That is why I drew attention to Rostelecom with its, as it turned out, still provided the ability to connect via ADSL. <br><br>  I picked up the suitable adsl-modem Huawei SmartAX MT880u.  He provided uninterrupted power to the ADSL modem via ethernet using the D-Link DWL P100 kit (I have a modem next to a telephone jack).  ADSL-modem itself is turned on in bridge mode.  And the authorization of both providers is configured directly on the router and do not forget to select the port that we use to configure the connection. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/141/4cb/afb/1414cbafba6dde9a93dbbe6a829d9c31.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Even in the settings, do not forget to determine the priority of the providers (I have the main ethernet, ADSL backup): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/620/5a3/99f/6205a399f2e821c09999a34cc39eb456.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And we include everything in the work. <br><br>  I made all the settings, guided by the documentation and recipes from the zyxel website.  It would be interesting to implement parallel operation of the channels, but this ‚ÄúWishlist‚Äù could not be realized. <br><br>  Instead of Kinetic, you can use the D-Link family of DFL routers, But the quality of the latter has not been particularly pleasing in recent years, although I used it actively sometime.  Zyxel products are also interesting in that there are now updated Kinetic models that have even more options for various settings.  Including a pair of shared USB ports, an updated version with gigabit ports.  There is a version with built-in ADSL port, but the truth is 100 Mbit.  Kinetic with one USB port either allowed only one connection or when using the hub they could fail randomly falling off devices.  Kinetics of various performance are currently available for various tasks and many allow you to expand your functionality with the ability to organize multiple Internet connections. <br><br>  As a result, I now have almost round-the-clock Internet (24/7/365).  And its absence can only be caused by the non-payment of both providers or by rebooting the router, and simply by disconnecting the rack. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7f1/bc9/367/7f1bc93678fbefac1ec2dc7bceef33a8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The picture shows which state is active and which is in reserve.  The cross marks the connection that was created to configure the connection on the newly created WAN port for the ADSL modem enabled in bridge mode. <br><br>  There is reason to pay attention to the use of fast DNS servers so that there is no confusion between the servers of different providers. <br><br>  Well, lastly, a cat protecting network equipment from connections, the router is hidden by a socket block and lies on a 100 MB (gray, topmost) switch. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/61a/211/717/61a211717a63a6c9f67c99f0994030d1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Now, on the shelf, instead of the cat, there is a pair of NAS-s, and on the base I put a couple of UPS. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/461013/">https://habr.com/ru/post/461013/</a></p>
