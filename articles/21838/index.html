What is coming to replace Web 2.0?  According to the results of a study conducted with the help of modern methods of information retrieval, the most frequently used concepts that users, professionals, analysts and scientists associate with Web 3.0, and therefore with the future of the Web, were identified. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  1. The Semantic Web (Semantic Web) is ‚Äúpart of a global concept for the development of the Internet, the goal of which is to realize the possibility of computer processing of information available on the World Wide Web.  The main focus of the concept is on working with metadata that uniquely characterize the properties and content of the World Wide Web resources, instead of the textual analysis of documents currently used ‚Äù(Wikipedia). That is, it is a kind of network over the World Wide Web containing metadata about the World Wide Web them. <br><br>  Optimists hope that when the Semantic Web technologies become sufficiently developed, they can be used to describe objects of the real world ‚Äî physical objects will be presented to the Web using metadata. <br><br>  Aaron Markus, who recently visited Russia (one of the world's largest experts in design and usability), agrees with the supporters of the Semantic Web: ‚ÄúI understand the Web 3.0 as an absolute distribution of the semantic web on the Internet, when information on the Global Network is not just accumulated, but understood comprehended.  Marcus believes that the software in Web 3.0 will be able to collect, organize, analyze to present information to people in such new formats that we cannot even imagine.  What is especially important now, when the information flow, generated by both professional webmasters and users themselves, has grown so much that it is becoming more and more difficult to navigate in it.

      In our opinion, they are similar to the understanding of Web 3.0 as a semantic web and a number of other concepts and ideas related to the development of the Internet in the future: <br>  ¬ªWeb 3.0 - these are uzkonishevye sites.  There is an opinion that the Network will develop along the path of creating more and more differentiated vertical social networks.  People will unite around one particular favorite cause, profession, hobby, share opinions, give and receive advices, recommendations.  A vivid example today is the culinary, medical sites. <br>  ¬ªWeb 3.0 as a social recommendatory institution, which is based on the automatic principle of recommendation.  According to experts, Web 3.0 of this kind will be different from Web 2.0 in that users will not only create content themselves, but will themselves certify it: mark something that deserves the attention of like-minded people.  The system allows you to do this automatically.  For example, imhonet.ru.  On the basis of your impressions about the books you have read and the films you have watched, you are given a list of recommenders - those whose interests most closely coincide with yours. <br>  ¬ªWeb 3.0 -" knowledge manager ", which is basically the same as the previous paragraph.  This is a new profession that will become a link between Web 1.0 (content removed from the user) and Web 2.0 (social services, where users are directly involved in creating content).  According to this version, the expert (‚Äúknowledge manager‚Äù) is the same referee, but not automatically selected, but deserving his position by real work within the community. <br>  ¬ªWeb 3.0 as a‚Äú live search ‚Äù.  Search by keywords are not robots, but real people, professionals in their fields, with whom you can also discuss all related issues in addition. <br>  ¬ªWeb 3.0 - multimedia search.  Back in 2007, IBM and the BBC announced the creation of their own Web 3.0.  The concept is based on a search engine capable of searching video content.  The search from IBM is based on the identification of internal video content with the text of a search query.  Until now, the search was carried out by text tags describing the video. <br><br>  2. Custom wireless networks - Web 3.0.  So the European researchers who are engaged in creation of the user wireless networks (WIP) have called the project.  According to them, if the content generated by users is Web 2.0, then the users generated by the network are Web 3.0.  Clients of such networks can independently combine their own communication channels and create new wireless networks. <br><br>  One of the project‚Äôs developers (Dr. Marcelo Dias de Amorim) (Marcelo Dias de Amorim) explains: ‚ÄúThe concept of Web 3.0 is to create a‚Äú reliable, flexible, optimized and, at the same time, ‚Äúuser-friendly‚Äù set of technologies and standards that would allow any user wherever he is, identify any device near him and create a network with him. It will be possible even if he doesn‚Äôt have any technical knowledge. ‚Äù <br><br>  3. ‚ÄúPolar information systems built on the principle of commerce-on-demand‚Äù is Web 3.0, Russian Internet entrepreneurs believe.  According to their calculations, the owner of such a system participates in the division of profits generated as a result of a transaction made using the system.  Why Web 3.0?  Because polar information systems, like Web 2.0, are subject to the effect of ‚Äúself-expansion‚Äù due to the activity of visitors. <br><br>  4. The world wide web in 3D is Web3.0.  There are opinions that virtual three-dimensional worlds will be the next stage in the development of the web.  We are waiting for not just games like Second Life, but the Internet in three-dimensional incarnation.  Perhaps, very soon, a 3D-realized character will leave the game and move freely around the World Wide Web.  What to go far if today the capital of Kazakhstan, Astana, has been built on the 3D Internet and it is positioned as the development of the emerging Web 3.0. <br><br>  5. Web 3.0 - the dominance of robots.  Today, robots search engines for information, send spam and viruses, who knows what awaits us tomorrow?  Maybe they will invent content for us, chat on forums and write blogs? <br><br>  And for a snack ... As a conclusion (picked up on one of the forums): <br>  ¬ªWEB 0.0 - the user wants to connect with someone or something <br>  ¬ªWEB 1.0 - user gets content <br>  ¬ªWEB 2.0 - user creates content <br>  ¬ªWEB 3.0 - collective content creation <br>  ¬ªWEB 4.0 - content thinks for the user <br>  ¬ªWEB 5.0 - content communicates with content <br>  "WEB 6.66- content removes users, realizing that they are meaningless <br><br>  <a href="http://blog-maye.ru/%3Fp%3D44">Original article</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/21838/">https://habr.com/ru/post/21838/</a></p>
