Ok, "accept." <br>  - ‚ÄúDear Citizen, the nature of your behavior (especially public messages) has become suspiciously close to the average behavior of law-breakers.

      I eat soup and change the desired destination point in the bus route, I hope that it‚Äôs not me who plans to go shopping ... Yes, the Market stop has been approved, the expected travel time is 3 hours, normal.  A night city, bright residential areas float outside.  Once every ten minutes, advertising messages are added from the mosaics of the house design, added in some places by a laser.  Cheap and angry :) This seems to be aimed at the rich 712th district, there are potential buyers of "antiques of the beginning of the century."  I drink coffee. <br><br>  What to do?  The bus is almost empty.  Youth as usual in gaming suits.  Sit, twitching, passing the next level.  And this kid is most likely a racer.  I put on a glove, "connect" and find myself in the cabin of a sedan of the last century, rushing along a busy street. <br><br>  Wow!  Goes well!  A lot of violations, cops, fine, more violations, chase ... <br>  After 5 minutes of play, he throws me out: "Pay in addition."  - I will not, and so sweat.  I look out the window, boredom creeps up again. <br><br>  Hmm, one of the Sims in front of me seemed familiar to me ... Hektor or not?  Watching info: ‚ÄúH.  Victor Anatolyevich ", Vityuha! <br>  I am sending a message: - "Hello!  I'm Alex, we worked with you as architects, remember? ‚Äù. <br>  He turns around and nods discreetly, probably even before he recognized me.  Why not fit?  Chtoli player busy? <br>  And how did he get into the sims?  Strange meeting.  Dressed like a decent, in two modern gloves, private area - 3 meters ... Now I suppose the player communicates. <br>  NDA ... I did not expect to see Hektor as a follower of the traditions of reality shows.  Scribe!  Computer games Sims and Sim City took a new level ... or dropped. <br><br>  Oh, he moved there.  He takes off his glove, picks up a backpack, comes up and sits down beside him. <br><br>  - Hi, Sanya!  Sorry, the Player did not want to let me go.  What's up? <br>  - Normally, the status is seven ... Now I am doing a project for the Branches.  Have you been in Sims for a long time? <br>  - Damn, do not ask.  I myself am not happy - I wanted to quickly cut the dough, so I signed up for a month.  Before that, he lived for two years for his own pleasure, he kept a little.  I don‚Äôt work in any way, so I decided to try something new.  And the player is probably quite young - tell him everything about life, what kind of Internet it used to be, what people were doing there ... Laughs when I start describing the keyboard, I don‚Äôt react to the mouse, I don‚Äôt understand about the joystick hysterical beats.  Got used to control the eyes and hands of the device like a ‚Äúmouse‚Äù seem a ridiculous tool for some professionals. <br><br>  - Ha!  Curious!  You are lucky that you are not a sadist, do not force you to run naked along the street and seek after random passers-by.) <br>  - This is yes, pah-pah-pah :) And I recently told him about the first branches.  It was a great time.  We didn‚Äôt know what this would mean. <br>  They created ‚Äúhome communities‚Äù to make it cheaper to buy traffic, food and clothes, take cheap loans, exchange things, etc.  No one thought that they would gain such strength and drive out the states ... <br>  - Yeah.  I remember as a neighbor convinced that if the manufacturer took the products, it would be cheaper to double, and you shouldn't go to the store: he called - they brought it in 5 minutes ... <br>  But nothing, for the first year more than a hundred.  Then they began to adopt internal laws.  The staff was hired, the apartment was purchased for business needs.  And when the community "House 21" invested in the construction of its own high-rise building, so much noise rose!  Countless checks, assaults ... <br>  But orders flooded) I then moved out of town, I even began to believe in communism.  At the project ‚ÄúAutonomous quarter‚Äù we met with you. <br>  I‚Äôll open the ‚Äúportfolio‚Äù channel to you now, there will be time - look at what houses I‚Äôve been doing projects for), but don‚Äôt show the Player. <br>  Changing media access settings. <br><br>  ‚ÄúOkay, I'll take a look.‚Äù  Sorry, the player is back - I will go to work.  Wite hastily jumped up and out of here. <br>  - Glad to meet you, bye! <br><br>  I get up, go to the bar and plunge into the memories. <br>  At first there was a large Internet and small communities in which they simply communicated, then large server communities in which there also lived small Departments that managed personal finances, work, property and leisure in communities. <br>  Now the departments are large and some call them countries ... <br>  Eh, half past three - I'll go to sleep before the arrival. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/790/">https://habr.com/ru/post/790/</a></p>
