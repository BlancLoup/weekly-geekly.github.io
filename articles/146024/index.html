  <section class="page js-page"><h1>On the need for self-development in the modern world</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Long before the very first cry and sigh of a newborn, programs are laid out in it, at a minimum, of physical development and growth.  Any beginning gives impetus, sets the direction for the development of this newest.  In the process of personality formation, the foundations of an individual value system are laid, which determine the needs, interests, and capabilities of a person, which, over time, they themselves begin to determine the activity of an individual from a certain point in personal time.  All this happens as life experience accumulates, the outside world is cognized, during the constant process of forming and changing the perception of the inner self, the interaction between internal subjectivity and the perceived objectivity of the external environment.  A set of specific initial data, various conditions and measures of interaction of all the previously mentioned factors in one way or another set the uniqueness and uniqueness of each person, thereby creating an almost inexhaustible diversity and uniqueness of characters, systems of behavior and thinking, however, except in rare cases, amenable to general classification. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  For example, in the usual class of elementary school there is always a fidget mischievous, pulling a redhead in the class and recess of a classmate with a sunny place of freckles on her face.  On the very same example, it becomes clear that, using certain specific concepts, a fairly commonly classified situation is described, understandable from the outside, but details of the descriptions of the personalities of these schoolchildren are omitted, despite the fact that these are already largely formed personalities with its physical, psycho-emotional, intellectual and spiritual characteristics. <br>  All of the above (with the exception of an example) applies to the functioning of organizations, associations, and structured entities in society. <br><br>  The interaction of various possible forms of diversity creates a constantly changing, dynamic environment that requires constant response from each of the forms.  Interactions can have both a positive, accumulative character, and a negative, destructive result.  In the context of a single resource base, this leads to a competitive struggle for certain advantages.  For a person, an organization, the priority in development becomes the acquisition of certain advantages of a different nature and different material and spiritual values.

      So, a red-haired girl can strive for excellent performance when her mentioned classmate will strive for gaining authority among peers and self-affirmation in her environment, and all this in a common class environment. <br><br>  A constantly changing environment and, in fact, a competitive struggle for advantages, certain resources lead to the need for constant analysis and adequate response, often ahead of the events.  In modern management theory, this took shape as a separate discipline - Change Management (Change Management), the main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhich is that changes in all aspects of personal and organizational development are constant (‚ÄúChanges are permanent‚Äù), therefore, to achieve and adjust the corresponding goals properly manage the process of change itself.  Due to the multiplicity and almost impossible to fully assess all the consequences of any impact, especially in mass social processes, one should mention one of the disciplines of the discipline: ‚ÄúIt is impossible to control changes, but you can affect changes‚Äù Influence the changes ‚Äù).  The main stages of the change process are successively: denial, fear, resistance, anger, depression, learning / learning, reception / absorption, involvement / participation / impact.  The very implied nature of the main changes is not so much the external plan as the internal one, again for the organization as well as for the individual.  According to the discipline, the main resource of successful change is the ability to appropriate internal restructuring, reassessment of goals and priorities, the redistribution of internal resources to the corresponding tasks. <br>  The reverse side of the inability to adapt, to counteract the effects of change is to counteract the process of change, resistance, self-isolation.  In such cases, there are negative effects directed inside / against the resisting.  Here it is important to understand the difference between competing systems and objective changes leading to a qualitative change in the environment. <br><br>  In higher grades, the behavior of a bully in relation to a girl-classmate, which earlier corresponded to a clear division into ‚Äúboys-girls‚Äù with consequent attempts to touch, due to physiological changes, leads to inertia by rejection, the impossibility of another kind of communication.  The discrepancy between the true desires and the prevailing stereotype of behavior does not allow the young man to properly express that interest in the red-haired girl, who unknowingly in childhood was expressed in twitching by the pigtails.  The same conflict of contradictions between desires and the established stereotype of behavior, forced isolation, lack of communication with the desired person lead to a change in the external manifestations of feelings, which begins to promote a more productive dialogue between adolescents. <br>  In the modern world, the number of changing factors is incomparably greater than in the example mentioned, the intensity of changes increases with the pace of globalization, the manifestations of new achievements of scientific progress, the mixing of cultures and the active migration of the masses.  All this diversity creates new conditions for the formation of a tougher competitive struggle both in economic, material aspects, politics, and in the spiritual, psycho-emotional spheres, clashes of personal, group value systems with drastic changes in previously existing objective realities and principles.  On the other hand, it is this diversity, these changes that ensure and determine the continuity of development. <br><br>  Given the emerging realities of constant change, the natural desire for behavioral stereotypes aimed at achieving positive results, it becomes obvious the need for continuous and continuous learning, self-development in the modern world of change.  The ongoing development of internal abilities, leading to the most effective manifestation in external manifestations, actions aimed at addressing internal and external conflicts between perceptions, capabilities, desires and realities in more advantageous and advantageous situations, allows to provide a positive effect, compete more successfully, respectively, to provide more impact, achieve greater benefits and preferences.  Continuous adequate internal development in accordance with the external development of the environment is a necessary and sufficient condition for a normal life and productive lifestyle. <br><br>  No matter how sacramental it sounds, the quotation of the Russian founder of scientific communism, V.I.  Lenin (Ulyanov) ‚ÄúTo study, learn and study again‚Äù with a broad interpretation characterizes the way of development for achieving a successful lifestyle, which perhaps is a common goal for all and everyone. <br><habracut><br>  In conclusion, it remains only to note that development, learning is more accessible to open consciousnesses, unnecessarily not burdened by dogma of postulates, the burden of a complete, closed systemic perception of the infinitely rich surrounding world, more accessible to consciousnesses capable of a bold flight of fancy combined with the vision of desired goals and reliance on creative approach to the use of the achievements of scientific thought of our time.  It should be a romantic in moderation, to believe in the best and have the will and desire to succeed, be able to develop yourself and influence the surrounding reality in the desired direction. </habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/146024/">https://habr.com/ru/post/146024/</a></p>
