  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Piracy "KM Online" proved in court</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Last Friday, translator Oleg Kolesnikov <a href="http://users.livejournal.com/magister_/191156.html">told</a> in a personal blog about the lawsuit he had won against KM Online.  The case in question concerned copyright infringement: the court prohibited this company from using Kolesnikov's translations and ordered it to pay the plaintiff compensation in the amount of 102,300 rubles. <br><br>  The trial of the infringement of copyright Oleg Kolesnikov‚Äôs copyright by KM Online was commenced by the Butyrsky Court of Moscow in late March 2006.  The essence of the incident - placing on the site <a href="http://vip.km.ru/">vip.km.ru</a> four translations of the plaintiff without his consent.  Translations of three novels by Fred Saberhagen and one work by Stanislav Lem were illegally uploaded in paid access and did not disappear from the site even after repeated warnings of the copyright holder.  ‚ÄúIn the end, I got tired of it, and the case was decided in court,‚Äù Kolesnikov said in an interview with <a href="http://www.b-online.ru/">the Business newspaper</a> . <br><br>  The network public remembers well with what zeal "KM Online" acted as the guardian of copyright just a couple of years ago.  Then the company managed to convince several writers to file a lawsuit against the holders of free electronic libraries.  In the end, for the ‚Äúlibrarians‚Äù the struggle turned into the payment of ridiculous amounts of compensation and broad support for the Internet masses, and for ‚ÄúKM Online‚Äù and the plaintiffs - only a bad name.

      ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs one thing for electronic libraries to recognize that, in fact, piracy is happening, but still seeking to settle relations with the authors,‚Äù says Kolesnikov‚Äôs translator, explaining his motivation to file a lawsuit, ‚Äúanother thing is the km.ru commercial site, which user money, fighting piracy, but he is essentially pirated. ‚Äù <br><br>  The court ordered KM Online to pay Oleg Kolesnikov compensation in the amount of 102,300 rubles.  The translator demanded a larger amount - 80,000 rubles for property rights, 210,000 for non-property rights.  However, the one that was appointed by the court is many times more suicide in the ‚ÄúKM Online‚Äù past ‚Äúanti-piracy‚Äù processes.  Moreover, the plaintiff will continue to sue the company - he said that he had prepared several more lawsuits. <br><br>  "KM Online" in turn is not going to give up easily.  Marina Berezovskaya, the chief lawyer of the NOCIT and attorney at KM Online, reported that the company appealed the court decision because it was ‚Äúhasty‚Äù and was made on the basis of just one document - a letter from the agency Alexander Korzhenevsky (that the translation was made) - while there is no contract between the translator and the publisher. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe lawyer of KM Online does not deny the fact of piracy,‚Äù says Oleg Kolesnikov, a translator, ‚Äújust expresses the hope of impunity ‚Äî moreover, in public.‚Äù </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4175/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4175/</a></p>
