  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Pro 112, and how it works</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  By writing this post I pushed the story about <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/ui_design_and_usability/64499/">Nokia and 112</a> .  Since I was engaged for some time just in answering calls to this number, I decided to tell some details related to the functioning of this system.  Perhaps this will help to understand some of the features that may cause bewilderment or discontent. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  About number 112 itself </h4><br>  To begin, I will tell about this number, and how it works.  The fact is that this is not an ordinary number, which was simply decided to be made ‚Äúemergency‚Äù.  This number is stitched into the GSM standard itself, and any phone in any state (no SIM, blocked, out of money) <b>must</b> be able to call it.  Those.  This is a special dedicated service number ( <i>lyrical digression: I saw a phone that had 911 as an emergency, but in practice it still called 112, such a small concern for users</i> ). <br><br>  This implies the following points: <br><ul><li>  The phone does not transmit your number during the call.  After all, if he calls without a SIM card, then he does not have this number.  And if there is, it still does not transmit.  As a result, to find out <b>who is</b> calling, you can only take the IMEI phone (serial number), and see if there was any phone with this IMEI already registered on the network.  But this is an extreme case, in addition ... </li><li>  ... the phone can connect to any operator to make this call.  Those.  it doesn't matter if you have MTS, Beeline or something else, but if the phone is not yet registered on the network, then you can get to anyone. </li><li>  The positive point is that in any roaming, in case of any problems, you can still call and ask for help. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  About who usually calls 112 </h4><br>  The room is so good that big problems start in this place.  The fact is that people like to check the performance of the phone somewhere by calling, and this is a very good, and still simple and free way to check the operation of the phone. <br>  Also, some phones, when they lose the network, display a message about the availability of only this number and dial it with one button (all for convenience).  In practice, this leads to sniffling and grunting into the phone when someone has a call in their pocket accidentally.  Sometimes they give a child to play with the phone without a SIM card, so as not to interfere, naturally the child immediately calls 112, you can listen to all sorts of children's sounds.

      <br>
      In my practice, 90% of calls were with silence or similar sounds, when people accidentally dialed this number.  The truth is especially remembered in one case when a person called and asked what to do.  Attempts to find out who is in his right mind revealed that the phone <i>told</i> him <i>that he should call 112</i> .  So he calls to find out what to do next. <br><br>  I lead all this to ensure that you understand the fact that a simple answering machine will immediately cut off a similar crowd of calls, and will greatly relieve the operators from these calls. <br><br>  The remaining 5% were all sorts of jokers and inadequate personalities.  The best way to communicate that I found when communicating with them is to turn on the robot.  You say some nonsense, trying to make a silly joke, and you answer them with standard phrases.  Their fantasy usually ends quickly and they leave you alone. <br><br>  Another 4 percent are connected with sane people who have problems with the phone or they just find out where they are, in order to find out if they should call again. <br><br>  Well, the remaining 1% is just the calls that should be sent to the police, fire or ambulance.  Those.  the percentage is very small, but people are usually in a difficult situation when they cannot call directly. <br><br><h4>  About the work of emergency services </h4><br>  For a start, important information.  Calls are sent to the service (or general processing center) <b>where the switch is located</b> .  In other words, if you are somewhere in the region, with a high degree of probability, the call will go to the regional center, and in addition to describing the problem, you still have to explain for a long time where to go.  After that, the call will be handed over to the service responsible for the area where you are located. <br><br>  Therefore, in order to save both your and other people's time, I recommend you to attend to direct emergency numbers in your city in advance (perhaps you will be told about 112, you can find them on the Internet or by calling from a landline).  Then you will have less to explain how to get there, because the operators of this city know it well and can easily understand where you really are. <br><br>  Special problems arise on the highway or in a village somewhere between cities.  Then you will be tortured for a long time, where are you in order to send a car from the point which is responsible for this area. <br><br>  So, if nothing is burning, then it is better to first find out the area of ‚Äã‚Äãresponsibility and then call them about your problem. <br><br>  Now, in fact, about the services themselves, about the attitude that I had for them.  Immediately I warn you that in different cities they can work in different ways, so this is my personal opinion. <br><br><h5>  Ambulance </h5><br>  In her call most often.  But they also send away, too, most often.  Although in fact they find out the details of the problem in order to understand whether it is worth it to rush or not.  However, there are many articles on the Internet how to call an ambulance correctly.  I will not retell them, I‚Äôll just say that at night the ambulance works very poorly, especially in small cities.  They may not be able to answer the phone for a couple of minutes, some subscribers have to explain that they cannot be connected, not because we are so bad, but because they really do not pick up the phone. <br><br><h5>  Police </h5><br>  In my practice, they always answered clearly and quickly.  But they rarely called, usually about drunken people found on the street.  The police asked to clarify whether a person is drunk or sick / beaten / dead to find out who and where to send.  By the way, if you decide to help such a person on the street, then it is better to first call the police and remain on the line to check the person‚Äôs condition so that in case of any problems you are not recognized as the culprit of the whole case. <br><br><h5>  Firefighters </h5><br>  Respond quickly and clearly.  True, they rarely call, but massively.  Those.  if there was a fire somewhere, then 10 people will call (and this is only 112!), in order to facilitate the work of the firemen, I already found out if that fire had already been called and did not forward the call. <br><br><h5>  MES </h5><br>  In my memory, only the Ministry of Emergency Situations called there to report something. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  I tried to talk about how it all works, so that you can imagine how your call goes and what you should expect, what you shouldn‚Äôt, and what internal mechanisms are hidden behind some, at first glance, not convenient and logical solutions. <br><br>  I will try to answer the questions in the comments if my qualification is enough.  I‚Äôll say right away that I won‚Äôt be able to provide details on how <b>exactly</b> this service is done for any operator. <br><br>  Well, I remind you my first post, and even non-core, so do not hit hard. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/66963/">https://habr.com/ru/post/66963/</a></p>
