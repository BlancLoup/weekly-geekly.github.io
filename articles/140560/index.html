  <section class="page js-page"><h1>A small firm has declared its rights to 482 top-level domains.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <a href="https://namespace.us/">Namespace</a> Registrar, a small company from New York, stated that it has rights to 482 top-level domains, and ICANN has no legal basis for registering them at the request of other applicants. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Among the domains ‚Äúowned‚Äù by Namespace were .shop, .hotel, .nyc, .sex, .green and a number of other valuable names that dozens of applicants now claim.  A complete list of names can be found <a href="https://namespace.us/CompleteTLDList.pdf">here</a> .  Namespace director Alex Mashinsky said that the company applied for ICANN to register only some of these domains, but the rights to all other names also belong to Namespace. <br><br>  Back in 1996, Namespace launched an alternative root zone with its own domain name system, in which even then it was possible to register multiple top-level domains.

      The situation seems absurd - there are quite a few alternative (and little-used) domain name systems.  Some company could guess to reserve all vocabulary words as top-level domains.  But Namespace and some other companies have legal grounds for their requirements. <br><br>  The fact is that ICANN began to gradually introduce new top-level domains back in 2000, at the same time the acceptance of applications for new domains was opened.  It was at that time that the .biz, .info, .name and .museum zones appeared.  Thousands of applications were then received by ICANN, but only a few domains were delegated. <br><br>  But you need to pay attention to the fact that ICANN did not give numerous applicants a clear answer about the refusal to register their domain.  Moreover, ICANN did not announce the end of the application period.  Thus, applicants who have applied for ICANN registration since 2000 formally take precedence over those who want to get a domain under the new gTLD program.  Namespace applied for 118 domain names at the time, and also did not receive a response about the refusal.  The company believes that all these names must be registered in its name. <br><br>  With such statements not only Namespace, but also other companies.  For example, Image Online Design, the owner of an alternative DNS, who also applied for the .web domain back in 2000, claims that this gTLD should belong to it. <br><br>  Another point - according to the rules of ICANN, those who submitted an application back in 2000, are given a discount of $ 86,000.  Recall that the cost of applying for a new gTLD is $ 185,000.  But a discount is provided for only one application, and Namespace requires a discount on all 118 domains on the basis of their rights to these domains. <br><br>  Experts warned that the introduction of new top-level domains would entail many completely unpredictable problems, and one of them we are now seeing.  ICANN lawyers have a tough job to do, because from a formal point of view, Namespace and other companies have reason to demand the right if not to names that are similar to the domains from their alternative DNS, then at least to the domains they wanted to register back in 2000 . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/140560/">https://habr.com/ru/post/140560/</a></p>
