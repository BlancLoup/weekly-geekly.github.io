      A year ago, I became interested in this issue and found out that building and promoting a personal brand is not as difficult as it may seem at first.  It is based on simple rules, which I will discuss in this article. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Everyone should not be able to sell, but behind every success is a successful sale. </h4><br>  The technical mind of Steve Wozniak would not have spread throughout the world without proper promotion and positioning.  We do not need to look for a ‚Äúpersonal Jobs‚Äù, because most of us (today) are not going to build a corporation.  Basic skills we can master independently. <br><br><h4>  Two directions of development </h4><br>  We have approved that knowledge is not the only success factor, but you cannot lose sight of them, because without them you will have nothing to tell about.  Igor Mann in his excellent book " <a href="http%253A%252F%252Fwww.mann-ivanov-ferber.ru%252Fbooks%252Fnomer_odin%252F">Number 1</a> " divided the development into professional and personal. <br><br><h4>  How to develop professionally </h4><br>  There are many development channels: books, articles, videos, conferences, master classes and much more.  Cover all fail, and not necessary.  Each industry has its main sources of knowledge.  For example, in IT, books are quickly becoming obsolete and it is preferable to use blogs and forums. <br><br>  Identify for yourself 1-3 main channels of knowledge acquisition and spend several hours a week on them. <br><br><h4>  How to develop personal skills </h4><br>  The ability to speak, write, create and defend ideas is very important.  Sometimes more important than bringing results (unfortunately).  It is on your personal skills that your promotion is built.  I will explain why. <br><br>  How do professionals promote themselves?  They write articles, books, speak at conferences.  All this activity is based on personal skills, and therefore it is important to pay attention to them. <br><br>  A month ago, I set a big goal, one of the criteria for achieving it was public speaking.  I know that this skill I have developed is worse than writing, so I gave him more attention and set the priority in my personal development plan. <br><br><h4>  How to make a personal skills development plan </h4><br>  Personal development plan brings together sources of knowledge and methods of their assimilation.  The main channel for obtaining knowledge, I highlighted the book.  The method of assimilation chose note-taking and application of basic thoughts.  Below I have listed the books that will help me develop the chosen skills. <br><br>  <i>Talk / Negotiation</i> <i><br></i>  <i><a href="http%253A%252F%252Fwww.mann-ivanov-ferber.ru%252Fbooks%252Fmif%252Fconversationstools%252F">Key negotiations.</a></i>  <i><a href="http%253A%252F%252Fwww.mann-ivanov-ferber.ru%252Fbooks%252Fmif%252Fconversationstools%252F">What and how to say when the stakes are high</a></i> <i><br></i>  <i><a href="http%253A%252F%252Fwww.mann-ivanov-ferber.ru%252Fbooks%252Fmif%252Fhow-succeed-people%252F">Communication skills</a></i> <i><br></i>  <i><a href="http%253A%252F%252Fwww.mann-ivanov-ferber.ru%252Fbooks%252Fmif%252Fjustlisten%252F">I hear you right through</a></i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Public performance</i> <i><br></i>  <i><a href="http%253A%252F%252Fwww.mann-ivanov-ferber.ru%252Fbooks%252Fpaperbook%252Fpresentationsecrets%252F">Presentation skills</a></i> <i><br></i>  <i><a href="http%253A%252F%252Fwww.mann-ivanov-ferber.ru%252Fbooks%252Fmif%252F050%252F%253Fbuytab%253Dpaperbook">Kamasutra for the speaker</a></i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Writing skills</i> <i><br></i>  <i><a href="http%253A%252F%252Fwww.mann-ivanov-ferber.ru%252Fbooks%252Fmif%252F025%252F">Minto Pyramid Principle</a></i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Creation</i> <i><br></i>  <i><a href="http%253A%252F%252Fwww.mann-ivanov-ferber.ru%252Fbooks%252Fpaperbook%252Fdisrupt%252F">Coup</a></i> <i><br></i>  <i><a href="http%253A%252F%252Fwww.mann-ivanov-ferber.ru%252Fbooks%252Fpaperbook%252Fpumpkin-plan%252F">Pumpkin method</a></i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Hold meetings</i> <i><br></i>  <i><a href="https%253A%252F%252Fwww.litres.ru%252Fdevid-perl%252Fopyat-soveschanie-kak-prevratit-pustye-obsuzhdeniya-v-effektivnye%252F">Again meeting?</a></i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>How to sell an idea</i> <i><br></i>  <i><a href="http%253A%252F%252Fwww.mann-ivanov-ferber.ru%252Fbooks%252Fpaperbook%252Fproday-svoyu-ideyu%252F">Sell ‚Äã‚Äãyour idea!</a></i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Promotion</i> <i><br></i>  <i><a href="http%253A%252F%252Fwww.mann-ivanov-ferber.ru%252Fbooks%252Fpaperbook%252Fplatform%252F">Platform: how to become visible on the Internet</a></i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Other</i> <i><br></i>  <i><a href="http%253A%252F%252Fwww.mann-ivanov-ferber.ru%252Fbooks%252Fpaperbook%252Ftalant-ni-pri-chem%252F">Talent to do with it!</a></i> <i><br></i>  <i><a href="http%253A%252F%252Fwww.mann-ivanov-ferber.ru%252Fbooks%252Fpaperbook%252Fturnyourselfintoabrand%252F">Turn yourself into a brand!</a></i> <i><br></i>  <i><a href="http%253A%252F%252Fwww.mann-ivanov-ferber.ru%252Fbooks%252Fmif%252Fthepoweroffocus%252F">Whole life</a></i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>In subject: <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/smartprogress/blog/312726/">30 sensible books on business, self-development and creativity, which changed my life</a></i> <br><br><h4>  How to sell yourself online and offline </h4><br>  Sell ‚Äã‚Äãyourself is not so difficult.  Harder to be worthy of selling.  Having mastered the basic personal and professional skills, it is the turn of promotion.  To find out about you, you need three things: <br><br>  - portfolio, <br>  - summary, <br>  - publications, speeches. <br><br>  These things are pretty simple, but extremely important. <br><br>  Portfolio tells about you as an individual.  Here you will need a writing skill.  Tell us why you should be interested in the employer or client. <br><br>  The resume talks about you as a professional.  Show the three best works and briefly describe them.  Resume is built on professional skills.  You can read about my career development experience in the article ‚Äú <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/smartprogress/blog/315106/">From zero to one. How I went from freelancer to chief designer in a year</a> ‚Äù. <br><br>  Publications and speeches show your erudition and experience.  Therefore, companies invest hundreds of thousands in events, and professionals strive to perform as much as possible.  Recognizability is a guarantee of quality. <br><br><h4>  How to start promotion right now </h4><br>  1. <b>Promotion begins with goal setting</b> . <br>  2. Define your professional aspirations and <b>make a development plan</b> based on them.  I brought mine above. <br>  3. <b>Select the main development channels</b> and allocate them a specific time.  For me, these are articles and books.  I give it an hour a day. <br>  4. <b>Collect accumulated information and analyze</b> .  I maintain a knowledge base in Evernote. <br>  5. <b>Start promoting yourself</b> .  Create a good portfolio, write a resume.  Try writing articles and look for opportunities to speak in public. <br>  6. <b>Do not stop</b> and remember that discipline is more important than motivation. <br><br>  <i>PS If you do not have an account in Habr√©, you can express your opinion on <a href="http://smarttalks.club/ru/promotion-professional-skills/">this article in our blog - SmartTalks</a></i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/315916/">https://habr.com/ru/post/315916/</a></p>
