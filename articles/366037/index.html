The post is not designed for experienced users of various media centers, but for beginners - such material would help me save a day of searching for a solution. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  On the migration from Xiaomi MiBox to the Chinese tv-console on Android. </h3><br>  I already had a MiBox TV box on Android from my favorite company Xiaomi (I <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/ifree/blog/237525/">wrote</a> about their fitness bracelet on Habr√©).  For almost a year, I used it in conjunction with an Acer projector and a self <b>-</b> made <b>NAS server from the EeePC 701</b> (the creation of this Frankenstein is a separate story, can be found in my blog).  However, despite the love of Xiaomi products, the prefix had certain drawbacks associated with its focus on the Chinese market: the terrible font of Russian subtitles with wide indents (relevant for watching anime), external sound tracks are not supported, the only sorting is a list with names files;  some BDrip shows with serious artifacts;  Do not play toys.  This is not to mention only the Chinese interface, which pleases not always.  It was not so easy to install another interface without serious picking the device (due to a shredded Android), and the technical characteristics of my version were rather weak - even USB was present only in the form of MicroUSB + OTG.  And even without a monitor connected via HDMI, external audio speakers hissed with a terrible sound (I could not find the reason and solution) ... <br><br>  In short, in my hands was a TV set-top box known in certain circles of the Chinese brand <b>Tronsmart</b> (it was already mentioned on <s>Habr√©</s> Giktimes).  The characteristics seemed quite good: RK3288, full <b>Android 4.4.2</b> , Google services, 1080p ... And there are <b>three USB ports in it</b> :

I even <b>had to plug a wireless mouse</b> into one of the free USB connectors in order to navigate the menu normally. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a46/076/b88/a46076b88aec8f24b62594543a315497.png" width="500" height="281"><br><br>  <i>A small remark: at this stage there was a curiosity that made me nervous, reset the tablet to the factory settings and go to the forums.</i>  <i>All the fault of the <b>extreme right button</b> status bar'a below.</i>  <i>He pressed it out of curiosity, and the <b>buttons below disappeared without a trace</b> .</i>  <i>Shoveling all the settings menu and reading in every letter, I climbed to Google, where I was prompted: to return the buttons, <b>move the mouse to the rightmost corner and pull up</b> .</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5d8/540/7a4/5d85407a49e38b634987809232426ae0.png" width="500" height="281"><br><br>  Benchmark <b>AnTuTu</b> issued the following results: <b>37831 parrot.</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/422/fc1/d5c/422fc1d5cc83054e05b54e0f40667832.png" width="500" height="281"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c1b/5fa/0e7/c1b5fa0e774bfd7326d2d6014ed049bc.png" width="500" height="281"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bba/bf8/cd4/bbabf8cd47b554fdbec08e66ce562ba2.png" width="500" height="281"><br><br>  In addition to <b>Google services</b> and standard software (including useless Camera, for example), a number of unfamiliar software of various degrees of inferiority was pre-installed in the ‚Äútablet‚Äù (as the prefix calls itself in Russian locale): <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0ec/6aa/eb7/0ec6aaeb73348428505f13ffebece2ae.png" width="500" height="281"><br><br>  Of the useful <b>stuff</b> , only <b>XBMC</b> was present here, which I replaced with <b>Kodi</b> (more on that below). <br><br>  What are programs from the manufacturer?  Something like this: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d83/196/69c/d8319669cfc29217f46913dc8f7dd7e5.png" width="500" height="281"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6f3/859/a1e/6f3859a1e827646a0eb18d73ee99d044.png" width="500" height="281"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ec5/611/8a1/ec56118a171da3cd96ef7f821360a8b8.png" width="500" height="281"><br><br>  At this stage, I really wanted to <b>"turn everything back and forth"</b> and return to let the Chinese and simple, but stylish interface MiBox'a.  Previously, I was not familiar with the software for TV set-top boxes, so there was a desire to quit the whole thing. <br><br><h3>  Soft: became </h3><br><br>  <b>‚Äú <em>But there must be a normal launcher!</em> ‚Äù -</b> I thought, and got into the Internet.  I will not long describe what terrible crafts I tried.  As a result, I stopped at the pre-installed <a href="http://kodi.tv/"><b>XBMC</b></a> - the only adequate program that comes with the set-top box, updating it to the latest version (already <a href="http://kodi.tv/"><b>Kodi</b></a> ). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e71/c2c/050/e71c2c050a8de26a75fe9515746268e8.png" width="500" height="281"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/335/cbc/d75/335cbcd75c629f03252427514b9f0b8a.png" width="500" height="281"><br><br>  Everything turned out to be intuitive.  First I switched to Russian, then through the ‚ÄúVideo‚Äù section I added directories to the NAS (via SMB), specifying the content type and selecting the plugin to upload descriptions from IMDB.  He did the same with the music. <br><br>  The second task was to hide the standard user-friendly interface.  This helped the free application <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dse.blunden.xbmclauncher"><b>XBMC Launcher</b></a> .  It is placed on the console through Google Play, and allows you to designate Kodi as a launcher (it is better to do this after completing other system settings). <br><br>  Another great addition was the app on the <b><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dorg.leetzone.android.yatsewidgetfree">Yatse</a></b> phone.  It allows you to fully manage the console from your phone.  Thanks to him, I was able to do something that did not allow MiBox, namely, <b>to control the</b> music <b>with the projector turned off.</b>  Now I turn on the phone completely calmly, and in two clicks I launch the desired song / folder / album.  Films can also be controlled. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/206/678/3f5/2066783f5338177434b2ea4f950bb0bd.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Moreover, through Kodi, you can even <b>control the rocking of torrents Transmission,</b> which works on the NAS.  And even ask her to stop current downloads while watching a movie, so as not to load the channel.  Yes, it is also possible to share content from a set-top box over the same SMB. <br><br>  Do not forget to set a fixed IP address so that Yatse does not get lost! <br><br><h3>  Performance </h3><br>  The prefix easily grinds any formats that are available to me, even a 20 GB 3D BDRip is played wirelessly without problems.  True, the opening of the file takes a few seconds, but the reason is most likely in the NAS (there are four hard drives working via USB 2.0 on a 100 Mbit channel ‚Äî surprisingly, it works at all). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/276/357/f85/276357f853523bf0ebabb041429cfb09.jpg" width="500" height="332"><br><br>  Interface delays have never been seen during the entire use.  100% smooth work of all. <br><br><h3>  Games </h3><br>  Honestly, until I figured out what to play on it.  The most frequent request in other reviews is ‚ÄúPut the Tanks !!!‚Äù, but outside of Russia they work practically in no way, so I didn‚Äôt even try.  Yes, and play without a normal controller is inconvenient.  It was possible to order a branded wireless gamepad from the same manufacturer: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/077/769/a33/077769a339511ac9735583848662a3c5.png" width="500" height="281"><br>  Perhaps in the near future I will. <br><br><h3>  Total </h3><br>  What did I want to achieve with the change of equipment, and what did I get? <br>  1. <b>Powerful iron</b> - yes: no brakes are noticed, it digests everything.  Games should go, but without a normal controller it is inconvenient to do this; <br>  2. <b>Nice interface</b> : out of the box - horror.  After an elementary refinement - great.  To do this, install <b>Kodi</b> and <b>XBMC Launcher;</b> <br>  3. <b>Work "without screen"</b> as a music center - yes, thanks to the free Yatse to the phone. <br>  4. A nice bonus - as many as <b>three USB connectors</b> to connect external keyboards / mice / hard drives. <br><br>  I got even more than I wanted, because I could not even dream of a decent cataloging with loading descriptions of films and music! <br><br>  <b>Minuses</b> : no <b>microphone</b> (I would like to manage the center through Google Voice);  <b>ugly chinese programs</b> .  However, after installing <b>Kodi</b> they will not be visible. <br><br>  To prevent the post from being advertisements, I don‚Äôt leave any links here: all the info you need (like ‚Äú <i>where</i> did you get the <i>prefix?</i> ‚Äù Or ‚Äú <i>what</i> kind of <i>NAS is from EeePC?</i> ‚Äù) Can be found in my blog. <br><br>  Some say that there is no point in the console if there is a DLNA-enabled TV, so I added a poll. <br><br>  If you have something to add or fix - please share.  Surely my implementation can be optimized even more :) <br><br>  UPD: Antutu "info" screenshots and image output options: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e8c/995/9bd/e8c9959bdefe4ac7843670e6780cd6f6.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3a4/8d9/ac7/3a48d9ac720d474cb33565b960227f16.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/54c/1f5/680/54c1f5680d7f4474981e59ddb3c9f00b.png"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/366037/">https://habr.com/ru/post/366037/</a></p>
