      Given that there are more telephones on the planet than all the other devices combined (bent a little, but almost so), materials are catastrophically low.  For example, I still have not really found the descriptions of those operator commands that secretly turn on the phone to wiretap.  Or how do operators and organs fight (and are they fighting) with scramblers? <br><br>  Why there are no hacker / open-source phone projects?

Always enjoyed old xeniums.  It seems that Vladivostok residents have this in their blood - they are too lazy to recharge every day, so they washed down a whole line of 10 models with powerful batteries.  4000 mAh battery (6-8 video reports with DEF CON) and a case thicker than a centimeter.  <i>(Near the old, kind, faithful phone "for bribes", which has served me as a flashlight for over 5 years.)</i> <br><br>  Looking at Boris <s>dick you get the</s> Razor, I come to the conclusion that very often a simple and crude method can be effective.  For example, to protect yourself from a hidden microphone on, you can stupidly put a mechanical toggle switch on / off the microphone. <br><br>  Right on the very top of the photo is a smart <a href="http://www.detsys.ru/catalog/ustrojstva-zashhity-peregovorov/sredstva-zashhity-akusticheskoj-informacii/%3Ffilter%3D61,62,63">phone case for Cocoon</a> (acoustic safe), which I was given to play at Detector Systems when I took from them an armful of field indicators and bug emulators.  (There will be a review soon.) <br>  Acoustic safe - a product designed to protect the voice information circulating in the places where the owner of a cell phone stays in the event of its activation for the purpose of listening through cellular channels.  Protection is provided by automatic acoustic noise transmission of the voice information transmission path during an attempt to tacitly activate the microphone of a cell phone handset.  ‚ÄúLadia‚Äù and ‚ÄúKokon‚Äù products have passed certification tests according to the requirements of the State Technical Commission of the Russian Federation (Certificates No. 697, 698) and can be used in designated rooms up to category 1 inclusive. <br><br>  The cell phone is placed inside the Cocoon.  In the case of tacit remote activation of the phone in the listening mode, the only indication of a unmasking sign is a change in the intensity of the electromagnetic field (i.e., the cellular phone transmitter is unauthorized to transmit).  This change is fixed by the field indicator, which is part of the product, which gives the command to automatically turn on the acoustic noise generator.  At the same time, the entire voice information transmission path is noisy in such a way that there are no signs of speech at the receiving end. <br><br>  Specifications: <br><br><ul><li>  The noise level at the location of the microphone cell phone: at least 100 dB </li><li>  Effective noise signal spectrum: 250 - 4000 Hz </li><li> Time of continuous operation from one set of batteries: at least 6 months </li><li>  Power supply of the Cocoon product: CR 2032 lithium battery </li><li>  Time of continuous work from one set of batteries: at least 2 months </li></ul><br><br></div></div><br><h4>  Story </h4><br>  The first mentions of the confrontation between the special services and ‚Äúhackers‚Äù in the field of telephony appeared in 1993-1995. <br><br>  <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipper_chip">Clipper chip</a></b> (1993) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7a4/a20/f79/7a4a20f79e2d4914b478b4c29249ea37.jpg"><br><br>  NSA made a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipper_chip">chip for encryption Clipper chip</a> .

This is an outdated standard, which, however, is used by a large number of manufacturers, and hundreds of millions of SIM-cards support DES.  So, this vulnerability allows, when sending a fake message from a carrier to a phone, to receive a 56-bit key in the reply message (the answer is sent automatically, and about 25% of DES-cards are subject to such ‚Äúdeception‚Äù). <br><br>  <i>(A small and not very hardcore note that flashed on Habr√©)</i> <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Listening to and protecting mobile phones</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  How do operators protect their networks? <br><br>  In the development of GSM technology, as well as at the stage of its implementation, all requirements from the controlling state were taken into account.  authorities to the level of protection.  It is precisely because of these requirements that the sale and purchase of special equipment, like powerful encryptors, crypto equipment, scramblers, as well as very protected technologies for public communication, is prohibited in many countries of the world.  But mobile operators themselves protect their radio channels using signal encryption methods.  Encryption uses very complex algorithms.  What kind of cryptographic algorithm will be encrypted is selected at the stage when the connection is established between the base station and the subscriber.  The degree of probability of a subscriber‚Äôs information leakage from the operator‚Äôs equipment, as MTS employees assured the journalists, that it is practically zero.  Why to zero, we asked - and all because of the complexity and control over access to the facilities and equipment of the operator. <br><br>  How can you "listen" to mobile phones? <br><br>  In total there are two methods of wiretapping subscribers - this is the active method and the passive method.  When listening to a subscriber passively, you need to use very expensive equipment and have specially trained employees.  If you have money (read - big money) on the ‚Äúblack market‚Äù you can purchase special complexes, using which you can listen to conversations of any subscriber within a radius of up to 500 meters.  Ask why you need to have a lot of money?  The answer is simple - the price of one such set starts from several hundreds of thousands of euros.  What this kit looks like is seen in the following photo.  In the network there are many sites where you can find a description and principle of operation of such sets and listening systems. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/525/99b/75b/52599b75bf0e4609b406e3ee659a4c34.png" alt="image"><br><br>  As manufacturers of such listening systems convince, their systems can track GSM-conversations in real time, because the principle of operation of the equipment is based on access to the SIM card of a mobile subscriber, or directly to the database of the cellular operator itself.  Although, if there is no such access for those who listen to you, they can listen to all your conversations with some delay.  The amount of delay depends on the level of encryption of the communication channel that an operator uses.  Similar systems can also be mobile centers for listening and tracking the movement of objects. <br><br>  The second method of wiretapping is active intervention directly on the air on the authentication process and control protocols.  For this purpose, special mobile complexes are used.  Such mobile systems, which, in fact, are a pair of specially modified phones and a laptop, despite their apparent simplicity and small size, are also an expensive pleasure - their price varies from a couple of tens of thousands to several hundred thousand US dollars.  And again, only highly qualified specialists in the field of communications can work on such equipment. <br><br>  The attack on the subscriber is carried out according to the following principle: since the complex is mobile and is located close to the subscriber - up to 500 meters - it ‚Äúintercepts‚Äù the signals for establishing a connection and transmitting data, replacing the base station of the operator.  In essence, the complex itself becomes a ‚Äúbridge‚Äù between the nearest base station and the subscriber himself. <br><br>  After ‚Äúcapturing‚Äù the desired mobile subscriber in this way, this complex can actually perform any control function over the intercepted channel: for example, connect the listener with any number necessary for those who listen to the number, lower the crypto-encryption algorithm, or disable this encryption altogether for a specific communication session and t .d <br><br>  How about looks like a similar complex - seen in the photo below. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/520/197/201/5201972019d14c8f834c599b6326c1d7.jpg" alt="image">  image <br><br>  As the experts shared, 100% to determine that the subscriber‚Äôs phone is tapped at this particular moment is impossible.  But, it is possible to obtain indirect evidence that may indicate that there is such a probability.  In the recent past, some mobile models (namely, push-button telephones) had in their functionality a special character-icon in the form of a lock.  If the lock was closed, then the signal goes in encrypted form, and vice versa - if the lock is open ... well, you yourself understood everything. <br><br>  But already in the phones over the past 5-6 years there is no such function ... A pity.  Although, for some models of smartphones special applications are provided that will signal to the owner of the phone about the configuration of the settings used in the current communication session.  One of the options is to notify the user about the mode in which his conversation is transmitted - using encryption algorithms or openly.  Listed below are a few of these applications: <br><br>  <b>EAGLE Security</b> <br><br>  It is one of the most powerful applications to protect your mobile from wiretapping.  This program prevents any connections to false base stations.  To determine the reliability of the station, verification of signatures and station identifiers is used.  In addition, the program independently monitors and remembers the location of all base stations and if it detects that a base is moving around the city, or its signal disappears from time to time from its location - this base is marked as false and suspicious and the application will notify the owner phone.  Another useful feature of the program is the ability to show which of the applications and programs installed on the phone have access to the video camera and microphone of your phone.  There is also a function to disable (prohibit) access of any unnecessary software to the camera. <br><br>  <b>Darshak</b> <br><br>  This program is different from the previous one and its main function is to track any suspicious activity on the network, including when using SMS, which can be sent without the permission of the phone owner.  The application in real time assesses how your network is secure and what encryption algorithm is used at that moment, and much more. <br><br>  <b>Android IMSI-Catcher Detector</b> <br><br>  This application also helps protect your smartphone from any connections to pseudo-bases.  The only drawback of this program is that you will not find it on Google Play and if you want to install it yet, you will have to tinker with this procedure. <br><br>  <b>CatcherCatcher</b> <br><br>  The CatcherCatcher program, like its counterparts above, is engaged in identifying spurious base stations that attackers (or special services?) Use as intermediate ‚Äúintermediary bridges‚Äù between the subscriber and the real base station. <br><br>  And finally, experts also recommended using special applications to ensure the security of personal conversations and data, including - to encrypt your conversations.  Such analogs are the anonymous web browsers Orbot or Orweb, for example.  There are also special programs that encrypt your telephone conversations, photos, and many already use secure messengers. <br>  Source - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/238923/">Listening to mobile phones and protecting them</a> <br></div></div><br><br>  <b>Review of solutions for the protection of telephone conversations</b> <br>  <i>(Some materials are taken from promotional leaflets, so common skepticism and comments are welcome)</i> <br><br><h4>  The tubes of the world </h4><br>  <a href="http://cdn.rohde-schwarz.com/pws/dl_downloads/dl_common_library/dl_brochures_and_datasheets/pdf_1/TopSecMobile_fly_ru_3606-6692-38_v0300.pdf">booklet</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/592/169/bc7/592169bc768c352723dedc2e6ef30bfc.gif" alt="image" align="left"><br><br>  TopSec GSM, created on the basis of the Siemens S35 phone by the German firm Rohde &amp; Swartz, provides ‚Äúfull traffic protection‚Äù. <br><br>  The device is a regular phone Siemens S35, upgraded with a special crypto chip.  Encryption is enabled by a special option in the phone menu.  In the protected mode, the phone can work both with the second TopSec phone and with the ISLC-phone ELCRODAT 6-2 of the same company. <br><br>  Protection is provided by encrypting traffic with a 128-bit key, and the session key is calculated using a 1024-bit key, which provides additional protection.  A distinctive feature of this phone is that encrypted packets are created in it in such a way that they are transparently perceived and transmitted over GSM networks, just like ordinary GSM packets. <br><br>  The price of this phone: $ 2,700.  Such a high price, however, did not prevent the high popularity of TopSec GSM.

As far as can be judged from the photo, it is made on the basis of the Sagem MC-850 phone, in the lower part of which a scrambling device is added. <br><br>  The HC-2413 provides a full duplex secure connection not only with similar devices, but also with the stationary telephone terminals HC-2203 of the same company.  For encryption, the device uses a 128-bit key and Crypto AG's own development algorithm. <br><br>  Using such a device allows you to protect your conversations from listening at any part of the transmission (of course, except for direct listening to ultra-sensitive microphones in the immediate vicinity of the subscriber). <br><br>  <b>Sectra tiger</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e4a/988/fff/e4a988fff664ab413fa65898b46399ee.gif" alt="image" align="left">  In April 2000, the Swedish company Sectra Communications launched an export model for its Tiger mobile digital phone. <br><br>  Sectra Tiger models using encryption technology with keys from 56 to 256 bits in length provide secure communication over public GSM networks. <br><br>  Sectra offers both centralized and distributed key management systems, either using SmartKey smart cards of the company itself, or using the KeyBeam infrared communication feature implemented in Tiger models.  Keys can be generated in the phone itself and sent directly to a narrow circle of users.  In the future, Sectra intends to develop versions of its phones for other wireless standards, in particular for the CDMA standard, which is widely used in the United States. <br><br>  Strict government regulation of the import and export of encryption technologies, in the opinion of company representatives, significantly limits the sales opportunities of such mobile phones.  In addition to the permission from the government, buyers also need a lot of money.  ‚ÄúCivilian‚Äù versions of Tiger mobile phones will cost about 5 thousand dollars, the discount is given only to those buyers who purchase a batch of devices of several hundred pieces. <br><br>  The device has the dimensions of a modern cell phone and weighs 197 g, but it is distinguished from traditional devices by the unusual arrangement of the antenna, which is installed at the bottom rather than at the top.  The mobile phone also has a slot for installing smart cards from which the encryption key is read. <br><br>  <b>Blackphone</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/900/993/445/90099344535740638f5ac1fe5681a45a.jpg" align="left"><br><br>  <a href="http://www.computerra.ru/117319/blackphone-2-details/">Blackphone 2: New Crypto Smartphone Details</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.computerra.ru/114062/blackphone-blackpwn/">The most secure BlackPhone smartphone was vulnerable</a> <br><br>  <i>no comments, except perhaps cool, that they create "their own appstore" for secure applications</i> <br><br clear="left"><br clear="left"><br clear="left"><h4>  Russian tubes </h4><br>  <b>Scrambler</b> <br>  <i>(Meanwhile in the <s>USSR,</s> Russia)</i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dd7/abc/561/dd7abc56142849f4bf5da0f261c15de9.jpg"><br>  "GUARD Bluetooth" from the company LOGOS. <br>  I will quote <a href="http://www.securitylab.ru/blog/personal/Business_without_danger/75667.php">Lukatsky</a> : <br><blockquote>  <i>Original sovok device.</i>  <i>There is no design as such.</i>  <i>Headsets tightly "sewn" in the device and replace it only with the device.</i>  <i>But the protection of negotiations is guaranteed - the device connects via Bluetooth to a transmitter - a computer or a phone (not a word about the protection of the Bluetooth channel using E0).</i>  <i>The device is not tested, but on the network you can find its review.</i>  <i>The appearance of ‚ÄúGUARD Bluetooth‚Äù in comparison with the same TopSec Mobile gives a very good idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow domestic and western SKZI relate (both in appearance, and in terms of user experience, and functionality).</i>  <i>But for the operation of this device does not require any external server - it is possible to work ‚Äúpoint-to-point‚Äù.</i> </blockquote><br>  <a href="http://www.mobile-review.com/articles/2009/scrambler-logos.shtml">Description from the user</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.skrembler.ru/prodakt.php">Description from the manufacturer</a> <br><br>  <b>PDA referee</b> <br>  Software and hardware kit for protection of negotiations in GSM networks <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/85f/c9c/d73/85fc9cd73e29c3d26d98e1985619751c.jpg" alt="image" align="left">  The hardware and software product ‚ÄúReferent-PDA‚Äù is designed for devices like a smartphone (communicator) that are running the Windows Mobile 2003/2005 operating system.  The PDA Referee helps prevent interception of negotiations between two communicators.  The kit consists of SD / miniSD - module, software and Qtek-8500 smartphone. <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The program interface contains: dial pad, call control buttons, the button for canceling the last digit and the indicator that displays the number to be dialed, the caller‚Äôs number on the incoming call, the state when the call is established, etc.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The program starts automatically when the SDA mini-SD module is connected, and the icon indicating that the program is launched into the background mode appears on the communicator screen in the lower right corner. To call another subscriber in the protected mode, you must click on the indication icon, and then perform the same actions in the opened ‚ÄúAssistant PDA‚Äù program as in a normal call. When a call comes from another set of PDA Referent, instead of the ‚Äúphone‚Äù program, the PDA Referent program interface automatically opens, then all the actions are the same as during a normal call. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the process of establishing a connection, special information is exchanged for mutual authentication of devices and generation of a session key.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Accepting and making an unprotected voice call is performed using standard communicator software. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The main difference between the product and its analogs is the use of a low-speed data transmission channel (up to 1600 baud), which allows working with a weak GSM signal (in places of poor reception), in roaming, with the use of various operators, etc. </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Let's just call it ‚Äúphone‚Äù</font></font></b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/999/146/78f/99914678f98d40d38ac28689556ae975.jpg"><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> (I ‚Äúsqueezed‚Äù this phone from Kostya, which is represented by </font></font><a href="http://hideport.com/%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D1%2589%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0-%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582-%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25BB%25D1%2583%25D1%2588%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Hideport.com</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> ) </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Chips - mechanical acoustics control (on / off button for microphone), body integrity control (hidden alarm when trying to get inside the pipe)</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It seems that this thing has a means of accessing other networks (cable modem, analog / digital modem, radio modem, satellite terminal or GSM modem). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But I still have to find out about this. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I got into the production of telephones for special services, allowed to make a couple of pictures:</font></font><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c73/b13/898/c73b138987704c3d86e94e15d484a17d.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/240/3f0/61d/2403f061d33c47039ded38cce8c3a405.jpg"><br><br><div class="spoiler"> <b class="spoiler_title"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">crumbs of details</font></font></b> <div class="spoiler_text">       (850, 900, 1800  1900 ),     ,     ACELP 4800 /, ,   ;   ‚Äì    ,  28147 1989  .  ,     ,   ,     ,   10 ,   .      . <br><br>    ,  .      ‚Äì 4 ,    ‚Äì 4,5,    ,         script-. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ccd/a1b/d59/ccda1bd59f06250bfa38a37aeca1a6e1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br> ,     ,       (, ),  ,   ,  ;     850/1900,      ‚Äì 900/1800.         ,      ,         BS26T.        ,    ,         ‚Äì   ,     . <br><br> <b>  </b> <br><br>  ,  GSM   ,         ,     . <br><br>    ,   :        ,    ,   ,    12 .         ,          .    ,    64 , ‚Äì        ,      .          .           ,            .   ,  ,      ,       (         ),      .

This kind of trick is possible because in the GSM standard a mobile phone is obliged to authenticate itself at the request of the network, but the network itself (base station) does not have to confirm its authenticity with the telephone. <br><br>  As soon as the mobile phone accepts the IMSI trap as its base station, this repeater can deactivate the encryption function enabled by the subscriber and work with the usual open signal, transferring it further than the real base station. <br>  With the help of IMSI traps, false calls or SMS can be sent to the phone, for example, with information about the new service of the false operator, which may contain the activation code of the microphone of the mobile device.  It is very difficult to determine that the microphone is on in the standby mobile phone, and an attacker can easily hear and record not only telephone conversations, but also conversations in the room where the mobile phone is located. <br></div></div><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Falsification of personal identification</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  In recent years, the use of a mobile phone as evidence of personal identification has become increasingly popular.  For example, a way to recover a lost account password to Google is to send an SMS with confirmation of the code to the owner of the phone.  Some banks use similar two-step authentication, sending codes to special mobile numbers in order to verify the identity of the client before the transaction.  Mobile versions of trojans were detected that could intercept SMS messages with passwords sent by banks and destroy two-step authentication. <br></div></div><br><br>  <b>Materials:</b> <br>  <a href="http://www.bnti.ru/showart.asp%3Faid%3D717%26lvl%3D04.03.07.02.">Cryptography in GSM networks</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/Garry54/crypto-phones">Crypto phones</a> <br>  <a href="http://archive.hack.lu/2010/Weinmann-All-Your-Baseband-Are-Belong-To-Us-slides.pdf">All Your Baseband Are Belong To Us</a> <br>  <a href="http://downloads.german-pavilion.com/downloads/pdf/exhibitor_20319.pdf">TopSec Product Family.</a>  <a href="http://downloads.german-pavilion.com/downloads/pdf/exhibitor_20319.pdf">Voice encryption at the highest security level</a> <br>  <a href="http://cdn.rohde-schwarz.com/pws/dl_downloads/dl_common_library/dl_brochures_and_datasheets/pdf_1/TopSecMobile_fly_ru_3606-6692-38_v0300.pdf">TopSec Mobile.</a>  <a href="http://cdn.rohde-schwarz.com/pws/dl_downloads/dl_common_library/dl_brochures_and_datasheets/pdf_1/TopSecMobile_fly_ru_3606-6692-38_v0300.pdf">Anti-listening phone calls</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.securitylab.ru/blog/personal/Business_without_danger/39014.php">Officials will be banned from using non-certified mobile phones</a> (2014) <br>  <a href="http://slon.ru/calendar/event/1141826/">How to avoid wiretapping?</a>  <a href="http://slon.ru/calendar/event/1141826/">There is a way</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.znak.com/urfo/articles/19-08-20-15/101089.html">Shh-ss.</a>  <a href="http://www.znak.com/urfo/articles/19-08-20-15/101089.html">This is not on the phone</a> <br><br>  MINISTRY OF RUSSIA.
