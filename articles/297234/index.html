  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Simple document generation for post-soviet entrepreneurs</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  If you are a programmer and an entrepreneur at the same time, then the fact that you are a programmer can greatly simplify the entrepreneurial routine.  And if you are an entrepreneur, but not a programmer, nothing prevents you from contacting a programmer for help. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, for example, I simplified my life by replacing with a single console team a monthly red tape with documents.  The problem was that at the time of receipt of payment from abroad, I needed to confirm the income with three (Karl! - so they say now? :)) documents: in addition to the contract, the act of the work performed, and, in fact, the invoice.  Two of them required the signature of the customer.  I could find out the exact amount that would go to my account only after receipt of this amount, so I could not prepare and submit the documents to the bank in advance.  In addition, the documents were required to coordinate with each other by document numbers, dates, etc.  One mistake - and it was necessary to urgently redo everything and re-sign so that the bank did not reverse the payment.  Needless to say, this is a great stress for an entrepreneur, and a rather unpleasant strain for the client. <br><br>  As a result, for each counterparty, I had a folder with a script modification and my own set of templates.  Modifications mainly differ in configurations, and sometimes it is necessary to add some format conversion functions.  The process is reduced to running the script, entering amounts and generalized work titles, and 10 seconds of waiting.  Then it all is sent by email, then to the printer, and then used for its intended purpose ... And sometimes not for the intended purpose, but this is a completely different story. <br><br>  What else ... You can add to the script sending documents by mail.  It is easy.  But I did not feel this need, since I have different ways of sending documents.  And yet I want to check the amount in the documents before shipping.  Although the error never happened.  You can also add tracking of the response to the letter and sending the received scans with print signatures.  Only sometimes customers send photos taken on a smartphone, which then still need to be cut.  But it does not matter, there is a console utility that can automatically cut photos of documents.  I even enjoyed it and was pleased with the result, but I forgot how it is called, so Google helps me.

      In conclusion, I want to say that having learned to write scripts (not to program, but to write scripts for myself), I got rid of many unpleasant works.  Let the computer work, but for now I will lean back in my chair and drink some coffee. <br><br>  The script can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/artemrizhov/invoicegen">github.com/artemrizhov/invoicegen</a> <br>  Pull requests are welcome. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297234/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297234/</a></p>
