It seems to be working, working, and the effect is small.

      I remembered the same condition while working as a freelancer and thought that I was not alone. <br><br>  I tried to set up an experiment - I took my usual working day and started writing down a report on what I was doing and how much time.  The numbers were not very pleasant.  Over time, he began to write down such reports every day, and as it is not surprising, things went uphill.  Even if no one sees these reports except me, I can see them perfectly and realize the problem.  When it is spinning in your head, you can just take it and dismiss these thoughts.  But when you read the reports for the whole month and see that things are really not going very well, then you cannot go anywhere and you begin to realize that you need to change something. <br><br>  After some time, I started to keep reports in Emacs (org-mode).  I used it, I studied it at a basic level and after some time I abandoned it - it seemed not very convenient, because these reports may need to be shared with superiors or customers, and exporting to the same HTML does not look so good. <br><br>  Actually, something like this was the idea to make your time tracker with <s>blackjack and</s> user-friendly interface and detailed reports. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  A little work in the evenings, a month of self-use to improve usability and was born <a href="https://timty.ru/">timty.ru</a> - the time-tracker of my dreams.  From the very beginning I wanted to make it very simple and convenient.  I hope that I did it. <br><br>  And now a small review. <br><br><h5>  Projects and tasks </h5><br>  To get started, you need to add projects and tasks.  This is done quite simply in this interface: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a46/d77/725/a46d77725432ba3959039bb99f696650.png"><br><br>  You can use the tasks as you wish.  I use them as categories - Front-End, Back-End, Design, etc. You can use, for example, as parts of a project (for a city portal - posters, weather, etc.) <br><br><h5>  Time tracking </h5><br>  Accounting itself goes in this interface: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/51d/cbd/808/51dcbd808507e6ee7e17b2cdac89e370.png"><br><br>  You choose a project and a task, enter a comment if necessary, and time tracking begins: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e11/659/be1/e11659be1c99438bfbf08c6006fae91e.png"><br><br>  If desired, you can immediately fill in the field with time to skip the stage with the timer and just add a certain number of minutes. <br><br>  And you can also choose not to choose a project and task, but write them immediately in the comment field with convenient autocompletion: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cfd/25a/127/cfd25a12716fd3728ed0a4b9f9851166.png"><br><br>  Below you will see a list of the time spent today, and you can continue working on each entry by clicking on the airplane icon. <br><br><h5>  Reports </h5><br>  After some time, you probably want to look at the results of your work and on the reports page you will see the following: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/252/024/97b/25202497b050d93da307a91e5403b833.png"><br><br>  You can see the report for any month or week (for going back and forth, use the arrows in the title).  Every day in the schedule is highlighted in one of three colors - red, green or yellow, depending on your diligence on this day. <br><br>  In addition, you can see the story: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a80/603/555/a8060355501cdbc212e6929c90ecfc6f.png"><br><br>  And of course, download the report in PDF format for the entire month or for certain projects. <br><br><h5>  Is free </h5><br>  At the moment, you can use the service absolutely free! <br><br>  Service address: <a href="https://timty.ru/">timty.ru</a> <br><br>  I look forward to your feedback! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/172535/">https://habr.com/ru/post/172535/</a></p>
