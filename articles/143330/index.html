The team is called DO ( <a href="http://www.wecando.ru/">wecando.ru</a> is a stub site) <br>  We are engaged in mobile marketing, as well as inventing various online services. <br>  There are many areas of development and interesting work with the material exhaust. <br>  I would like to gather like-minded people and try to work in a team with a horizontal scheme (a la Valve) <br><br>  Andrey - motion-designer, entrepreneur (in the past there was his own pizzeria) <br>  I am Sasha - designer and AS3 / JS / HTML coder, working on a permanent basis in LUMATA as a creative ( <a href="http://www.lumata.com/">www.lumata.com</a> ) <br>  There are a couple of friends - great strategists. <br>  There is a huge amount of different international expertise (Coke, Orange, MTS) in mobile marketing and in general in digital communications, but, unfortunately, 2 people are too few to turn the world around. <br><br>  Who is interested - ask, we will answer all questions. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

    <img src="http://www.wecando.ru/img/wcd_logo_green_short.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>UPD.</b> <br>  We would like to follow the Blue Ocean strategy and offer real-life services for companies based on SaaS.  For example: mobile CRM, loyalty programs, offline traffic generators (discounts, couponing, etc.), mobile sync hubs (for example, a bundle of TV and tablets / mobile phones).  This niche is not yet "defined".  We want to create it.  A lot of opportunities, and most importantly - there is a demand from the largest brands (mobile operators, banks, FMCG and even medicine) <br>  As for non-B2B developments, we love games and services that make life easier.  There are many ideas on this topic that require discussion and, of course, ‚Äúdoing‚Äù. <br><br>  On a financial condition: at the moment there are 3 projects under contracts for a total amount of 900k rubles.  The money received from these projects (100%), we, by agreement with all members of the team, want to reinvest in development.  Also, all the money from the next few is also 100% developed. <br><br>  To the question "Who do we need?".  We need everything.  And journalists, and strategists, and developers of any kind and level, and designers, and animators, and operators, and speakers, and even a shoemaker would not hurt.  The main thing is the idea in which people are united.  If, for example, everyone decides that making GPS insoles in a shoe is megacut, then we just take it and do it. <br><br>  <b>UPD 2</b> <br>  It is curious that we have already received 26 responses from people from Russia, Tokyo, New York, Switzerland and Serbia, but the topic continues to fall in the rankings, which somehow tells us that the majority do not even finish reading this point.  Request: if you minus it, then do not be lazy to write at least a comment. <br><br>  <b>UPD 3</b> <br>  Judging by the feedback and comments you need to add specifics. <br>  <b>1.</b> For the time being, we do not require everything to be abandoned and run to us.  If you can devote some of your free time, it's just great! <br><br>  <b>2.</b> The development strategy at the moment is in development, as well as the set of products that we plan to launch by the end of the year. <br><br>  <b>3.</b> For the next week and a half, the plan is as follows: we collect contacts of interested and agree with everyone about the webinar.  It will answer all your questions, as well as the draft strategy and product draft. <br><br>  <b>4.</b> Now we have made it clear which way we will move: <br><ul><li>  <b>Mobile loyalty programs</b> </li><li>  Mobile CRM </li><li>  <b>Mobile games (iOS / Android / WP7)</b> </li><li>  <b>Micro SaaS</b> </li><li>  SaaS advertising and creative solutions (of any kind) </li></ul><br>  What is highlighted in bold - in priority. <br><br>  <b>5.</b> The most valuable people for us at the moment: <br><ul><li>  Mobile developers (Android, iOS, WP7) </li><li>  Back-end developers (preferably PHP, Ruby, C #) </li><li>  Front-end developers (JS, HTML5) </li><li>  Usability (Axure) </li><li>  Strategists (namely digital strategists with experience and willingness to defend their ideas) </li><li>  Marketers (with work experience or theoretical base from retail, e-commerce or social games) </li></ul><br><br>  <b>6.</b> To systematize the responses - please fill out a simple form: <br>  <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform%3Fformkey%3DdG9uVWNBbl9RS3AyZVpaQ1BSTU1hMEE6MQ">docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dG9uVWNBbl9RS3AyZVpaQ1BSTU1hMEE6MQ#gid=0</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/143330/">https://habr.com/ru/post/143330/</a></p>
