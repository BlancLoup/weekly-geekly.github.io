Now, in order to send you any unwanted advertising message, the spammer has to send it from some address present in your address book, which greatly complicates the process of sending such messages, makes it less cost-effective, and sometimes even impossible (with certain Sender Policy settings Framework for the sender's domain). <br><br>  <b>How to receive mail from "unfamiliar" addresses?</b> <br>  What to do if you need to receive a letter from an address that is not included in your contact list?  To do this, Mail.UA provides the following features: <br><ul><li>  You can receive messages to one of the temporary e-mail addresses.  This method is convenient for registration on various web-services where a real email address is required. </li><li>  You can send a message through your personal page of the user Mail.UA.  See more about this method below. </li></ul><br>  <b>User personal page (business card)</b> <br>  Each user of the Mail.UA service receives a personalized web page (business card) at registration, available at <a href="http://www.username.mail.ua/">www.username.mail.ua</a> (here username is the name of the user he chose during registration).

    <img src="http://mail.ua/img/static/help/general/cover_small.gif"><br><br><h4>  Additional temporary mailing addresses to your primary </h4><br>  Very often, when registering on a certain web-service (website, forum, mailing list), you must specify the real e-mail address.  Using your primary address (username@mail.ua) in this case may not be desirable for various reasons, or even simply impossible due to the nature of the anti-spam system at Mail.UA (since you do not know which addresses will be sent messages from this service and, accordingly, you can not add them to your contact list). <br><br>  For such cases, Mail.UA allows you to create an arbitrary number of ‚Äútemporary‚Äù e-mail addresses (aliases) in addition to its main address (user@mail.ua).  The temporary address is: alias_user@mail.ua, where alias is an arbitrary prefix.  All messages that come to any of the additional addresses are automatically sent to your inbox just as if they were sent to the main address. <br><br><img src="http://mail.ua/img/static/help/general/temp3.gif"><br>  The difference from the main address is that you can set separate filtering rules for incoming messages for each alias.  Immediately after creating a temporary address, the system accepts all messages arriving at this address (i.e., the ‚Äúwhite list‚Äù principle does not work in this case).  Later, after receiving a certain number of incoming messages, the system itself determines the addresses from which messages come to this alias and thus creates a separate ‚Äúwhite list‚Äù. <br><br><h4>  Convenient interface, traditional for desktop applications </h4><br>  The developers of Mail.UA have tried to bring the appearance and reactions of the system closer to the appearance and reactions of e-mail programs launched locally on a computer, such as Outlook Express or The Bat. <br><br><img src="http://mail.ua/img/static/help/general/interface_small.gif"><br>  When working with our service, you will find such familiar features as: <br><ul><li>  instant reaction to user actions (without having to wait until the whole page is reloaded); </li><li>  the ability to change the appearance of the system, by selecting one of the pre-installed themes; </li><li>  context menus of objects (called by the right mouse button); </li><li>  pop-up dialog boxes; </li><li>  drag and drop operations (drag-n-drop). </li></ul><br><h4>  Folders, filters, sharing and more that will help you to work effectively </h4><br>  The Mail.UA user can organize the storage of his data (messages or contacts, etc.) in the form of a hierarchical folder structure.  But unlike normal programs (such as Outlook Express), any object can be placed in an arbitrary number of folders. <br><br><img src="http://mail.ua/img/static/help/general/dd_end_small.gif"><br>  For example, you have the ‚ÄúWork‚Äù and ‚ÄúFriends‚Äù folders and the contact ‚ÄúAndrey‚Äù, which is placed in both of these folders because  he is both a work colleague and your friend. <br>  In this case, you can always get a complete list of the necessary objects: so the ‚ÄúAll Contacts‚Äù folder always displays a list of all contacts in your address book. <br><br>  <b>Folder sharing</b> <br>  The Mail.UA user has the ability to open access to parts of his messages or contacts to other users of the service (‚Äúshare‚Äù - as programmers call this operation). <br>  Using this tool, a group of users can create shared contact lists and folders where messages will be available to all users of the group.  This is extremely convenient, for example, for organizing a single list of contacts in the company and folders with general incoming correspondence. <br>  Sharing is possible only at the folder level, i.e.  you cannot open one contact or one message for access - this can be done only for the entire folder. <br><br>  It seems to me that their service deserves attention.  I see a system of pseudonyms especially useful for me. <br><br>  We are waiting for a public opening, but for now registration is only by invite. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/38289/">https://habr.com/ru/post/38289/</a></p>
