  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The history of the introduction of EDS in one enterprise</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The company profile is the production of pharmaceuticals, design, construction and equipment of medical facilities.  Distributed structure: head office and production - in Moscow, a branch in St. Petersburg.  150 employees. <br><br><h3>  As it was </h3><br>  Prior to the project, the enterprise was a classic example of an enterprise with processes that were traditional for post-Soviet office work - running around with papers on offices, sheets for resolutions and approvals, and therefore irresponsible performers.  The manual has been talking for a long time that the current document approval system is not perfect: often documents were lost in the approval process, individual sheets of already agreed documents were substituted just before signing, and it was impossible to find the guilty ones.  Orders for documents were also issued in the old fashioned way: the secretary, receiving an incoming document by e-mail, printed it out on the printer and made a note in the register, then attached a document sheet for the resolution to the document, carried it to the director, and put the resolution on the document with the appointment of the performer.  Then this piece of paper with the document was returned to the secretary, who scanned both the resolution and the document and sent the file to the designated executor by e-mail. <br><br>  With such a system for issuing instructions, there could be no control over their execution.  Files sent to the responsible executives by mail flew to nowhere, and the phrase ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt received anything‚Äù sounded more and more often.  We had to spend time on proving that the files were still sent.  One of the solutions to the problem is to manually monitor the progress of each order execution, but for this you need to have a staff of clerk-supervisors, but it was not foreseen.  Such a ‚Äúsystem‚Äù gave rise to the unlimited lack of control and irresponsibility of performers on the ground.  However, it did not move. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In December 2015, I voiced the thought to management: if we do not begin work on transition to the modern level of enterprise management immediately, we risk falling behind competitors who have already begun to actively switch to modern technologies for managing their business.  Moreover, the necessary regulatory framework in the country has existed for a long time.  To make a decision on the implementation of the system, there were not enough real numbers, and I sat down for calculations.

      On the one hand, it was necessary to understand how much the company loses with the current management mechanisms, and on the other, to estimate the cost of labor while improving management efficiency.  In assessing, I took the processes that I planned to automate, the monthly workload (the number of operations per process), the average salary of employees who participate in these processes.  It turned out that the company lost 2,000,000 rubles annually on the existing procedure for negotiating contracts, 850,000 rubles on processing incoming, outgoing and internal correspondence, 350,000 on finding the necessary information. We didn‚Äôt spend anything on controlling performance discipline, because did not lead him.  And this was at least familiar to the business, but the detrimental consequences were the disruption of the terms of fulfillment of obligations under the execution of contracts, penalties, court proceedings with customers and contractors. <br><br>  Taking into account the potential labor costs for the control of executive discipline, an economic paradox was obtained: in order to save by improving management, we would need to increase labor costs by at least 4.5 million rubles annually.  My figures showed the obvious: in the long term, it was more profitable for the enterprise to switch to an electronic document management system, namely, to automate work with organizational and administrative documents of the enterprise, automate work on negotiating contractual documents, improve the mechanisms for issuing and controlling the execution of instructions from the manager. <br><br><h3>  Choosing a platform and service provider, project protection </h3><br>  SED is chosen not for one year, but with a prospect of at least five years, so at this stage I had to find a technological solution that would fit into the budget of the enterprise;  was the development of a well-known software manufacturer on the market;  the manufacturer had partners for implementation.  In addition to this - select a reliable contractor, prepare and protect the project before the management;  enter into a contract. <br><br>  I began to study the systems market: I ordered presentations, consulted with IT specialists, compared them.  My requirements for the platform were: the ability to administer and maintain it by the enterprise after the introduction, increasing the functionality of the platform as needed, a certain cost of software and licenses, a domestic manufacturer.  In all respects, the Russian-made Docsvision platform came up.  It remains to determine the final implementation budget as soon as possible and find a reliable service provider for the development and delivery of the configuration we need. <br><br>  In order to accurately determine the project budget and avoid financial overspending in the future, I analyzed the source data: I surveyed structural units and determined the types of documents that were supposed to be automated in the project, described internal processes, clarified the number of users of the system.  Based on this data, I requested commercial offers from a dozen Docsvision partners.  When evaluating the proposals, I paid attention to the fact that the supplier had a boxed solution that could be configured in the shortest time possible to meet our requirements.  After conducting a cycle of interviews with potential suppliers, an adequate project budget was formed. <br><br>  I submitted the project budget to management.  Thus, the final cost of the project (taking into account the services of the contractor, the necessary hardware and software) was 3 million, which in the future allowed the company to save labor costs to increase work efficiency of 4.5 million rubles annually.  In April 2016, I successfully defended the project budget to the management and concluded an implementation contract. <br><br><h3>  Preparation for implementation </h3><br>  I, as a representative of the customer, had to establish communication between the departments concerned and the contractor, together with the contractor carefully analyze and formalize the current business processes to be automated.  To automate business processes according to our requirements, it was necessary to expand all the routes for document movement, approve document templates, determine the information access policy and other small but important details.  That's what we did with the contractor for a month.  And by mid-May 2016 the design project of our system was ready.  Development has begun, which was completed by the end of June 2016.  After the acceptance of the configuration and the removal of the identified deficiencies, everything was ready to launch the system into trial operation. <br><br>  In July 2016, I organized group training for 100 system users.  The team and I planned to launch a wide functionality into operation in one fell swoop, so the aim of the training was to train the staff only in basic concepts and skills so that all other features of the system would be mastered by the users during operation.  Another condition for learning was to conduct it as quickly as possible so that users trained in the first groups (5-7 people each) did not have time to lose knowledge by the time the system was launched into operation.  To this end, I united the groups on the basis of age: the younger users were trained first, then the people of older and retirement age.  Thus, older generations did not have time to lose their skills by the time the system was launched. <br><br><h3>  Trial operation </h3><br>  When launching the system into trial operation, we encountered a problem that I had foreseen: some users wanted to work as before, tried to bring the documents for approval in a printout, etc., out of habit. I was ready for this.  In order to dispel all doubts of the dissenters and avoid sabotage, I prepared in advance all the necessary internal regulations that legalize the new and repeal the old order.  In addition, he had previously held explanatory conversations with the management and conveyed the idea that the success of trial operation will depend, inter alia, on the firm position ‚Äúfrom above‚Äù and, most importantly, on their active work in the system.  So it was possible to create conditions under which users have nothing left but to accept the new rules. <br><br>  As expected, as a result of trial operation, we and the contractor identified a number of omissions and promptly corrected the system configuration. <br><br><h3>  results </h3><br>  In September 2016, the system was launched into commercial operation.  During the project, work was automated with organizational and administrative documentation, tender contract work, control of executive discipline.  The following results were achieved: remote structural subdivisions of the enterprise were united into a single information space, the degree of interaction between the divisions of the enterprise was increased in the process of document approval (terms for document approval were reduced 6 times, processing time for incoming documents and issuing instructions for them - 10 times) , the possibility of losing and changing documents in the process of agreeing and signing them is excluded by 100%, the security of access to information is improved, the power is increased by 100%  performing discipline of employees due to improved control mechanisms. <br><br>  According to the results of the implementation and the first three months of the system‚Äôs operation, the management set a new task - to expand the functionality of the system and automate the work of the sales department. <br><br>  <i>About me: The head of the general department, the duties include the management of the unit, including the support and development of documentation support for management in the enterprise.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/320378/">https://habr.com/ru/post/320378/</a></p>
