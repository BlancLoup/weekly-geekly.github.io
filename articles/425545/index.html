  <section class="page js-page"><h1>You should think about the practice hours.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  If you are a musician or you know someone from musicians, then you are familiar with such concepts as "practice" and "rehearsal."  They have <b>completely</b> different meanings. <br><br>  Most musicians have "sacred" practice hours.  They do it not for artists, groups or anyone else.  This is the time to sit down and focus on the technique, the song they want to learn, or what their heart desires. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/3e/fg/jc/3efgjcrvf2i5rmd8xxfnfiezkpy.gif"></div><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Developers also need such time. </h3><br>  When I first started learning programming, I devoted about 60-70 hours a week to programming practice.  This allowed me to learn a lot and gain the ability to learn quickly.  As you might have guessed, I was fascinated by this activity.

      After graduation, I took a break.  I have not spent so much time writing code, as before.  I managed to find a job as a developer with a 40 hour work week.  My company has its own open source JavaScript framework, and we also use Craft CMS.  The first two months I spent on studying our tools. <br><br>  After some time working on the tools of my company, I began to learn about new technologies that I wanted to try.  I also found that I wanted to learn Backend languages ‚Äã‚Äãand their concept.  There was no practical sense of studying them, I just wanted development.  So I got the idea to create my own practice hours. <br><br><h3>  My daily duties </h3><br>  I started by writing arbitrary applications and immediately ran into a problem.  I started to forget what I'm working on.  Hello, GitHub Cemetery!  It was hard for me to concentrate without a project manager or a Trello board.  In the end, I decided to create some kind of analogue of familiar surroundings and bought a notebook on a spiral for daily practical exercises.  In fact, this is just an example and it doesn‚Äôt matter what you choose to make your task easier. <br><br>  Classes begin with a review of what was previously learned.  Next, I write down what needs to be focused on this time.  This roughly corresponds to the formula: <br><br>  <i>Today I want to know more about _.</i>  <i>For this, I need to read / practice _.</i> <br><br>  I take notes in my notebook while I work.  When I finished and feel satisfied with what I learned, the lesson ends with the following sentence: <br><br>  <i>Today I have studied / tried _ and I feel that _.</i> <br><br>  Summing up is very important.  My intention to learn something never coincides with what really was found out.  So that I do not study, I always come to the fact that I need to study something else for understanding the originally planned topic. <br><br>  The description of feelings plays a crucial role for growth.  I can keep track of topics that make me feel successful, depressed, or completely overwhelmed.  Often, I realize that I need someone to help understand some concept.  Only online tutorials can take you so far! <br><br>  When deciding how much time per week you want to devote to practice, consider starting with a small session.  To begin, you need to not lose concentration on the selected topic.  Once you have a habit, you can increase the duration of classes. <br><br>  When you are ready to increase the duration of the practice, you can pay attention to the idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãMalcolm Gladwell about 10,000 hours.  You can read about it in his book ‚ÄúGeniuses and Outsiders.  Why is everything one and nothing for the other? ‚Äù <br><br>  His idea is the key to achieving world-class skills in any field.  This is just a matter of practice for a total of 10,000 hours.  Let's see how to achieve this.  If you practice for 3 hours a day, then the total will take 3333 days, or just over 9 years.  <b>I do not recommend</b> going this way.  Life beyond software development is much more important.  There is a more productive way. <br><br>  <b>I recommend a</b> healthy match for your goals, available time and perseverance.  After that add the idea of ‚Äã‚Äã10,000 hours and mix well.  Of course, your goal may be: to become the youngest senior developer in the world, you have a lot of time and unbending will ... Yes, in this case you can ignore my recommendation. <br><br>  However, if you are an ordinary person who strives to have a fun and fulfilling life, you need to be more realistic.  Strive for progress, not perfection, and I promise that you will achieve your goals. <br><br><h3>  A small test from me to determine your ideal practice session schedule. </h3><br><ol><li>  I am ready to achieve my goals: <br><br>  A) I want this as quickly as possible.  Let's get started already! <br>  B) In a reasonable time.  I am ambitious, but I can wait. <br>  C) I'm not in a hurry.  Success takes time!  It's about travel. </li><li>  I understand that success means: <br><br>  A) Hard work, many hours of work and losses in other aspects of life. <br>  B) Efficient work, timeliness and use of all opportunities. <br>  C) Relationship with other people, make bets long-term achievements. </li><li>  I want to enter the top: <br><br>  A) 2 percent <br>  B) 25 percent <br>  C) 50 percent </li><li>  My life is: <br><br>  A) Concentration on a specific goal. <br>  B) Lack of time <br>  C) here and now </li><li>  I am willing to donate <br><br>  A) everyone <br>  B) Evenings and weekdays as needed <br>  C) No casualties! </li></ol><br><h4>  If the majority of your answers are - </h4><br>  Congratulations!  You are charged for success and do not stop at nothing.  I would recommend you a quick study plan.  4-5 days a week with 3-4 hours of training in one session.  Let's be honest, why are you reading this article?  You already know everything.  Now go and realize your potential! <br><br><h4>  If the majority of your answers are B </h4><br>  Congratulations!  You are ready to achieve your goals.  I would recommend a moderate curriculum for 2-3 sessions per week with classes from 1 to 2 hours at a time.  Good luck! <br><br><h4>  If the majority of your answers - With </h4><br>  Congratulations!  You are ready for success.  Take a breath of air and carefully remember the moment before the upcoming journey.  Then it will only get better.  I would recommend a leisurely practice plan with 1-2 sessions per week from 30 minutes to 1 hour at a time. <br><br><h4>  If you are somewhere in the middle </h4><br>  Take a look at the work schedule, project cycles and free time.  Start with a simple goal and strive not to switch from it.  Next, increase the time classes, be consistent. <br><br><h3>  Finally </h3><br>  Hours of practice is working on what you want outside of your work.  This allows you to focus <b>on your goals</b> .  In fact, I think that it‚Äôs not important that you work as a developer or are just going to become one.  This practice will work equally well in both cases. <br><br>  Hooray!  You did it!  Thanks for reading my article on building a schedule of practice hours! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/425545/">https://habr.com/ru/post/425545/</a></p>
