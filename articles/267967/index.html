  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Watson Health continues to evolve</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d9a/856/df6/d9a856df6e874045ab0c1632cee1196f.jpg"><br><br>  IBM has <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/09/10/ibm-watson-health-unit-begins-to-take-shape/">announced plans to</a> expand its Watson Health division.  In this regard, the company has already introduced two new cloud services related to IBM Watson, plus agreed to cooperate with a wide range of international companies. <br><br>  One of the presented services is the IBM Watson Health Cloud for Life Sciences Compliance, it is proposed to use it to facilitate and accelerate the certification of various biomedical developments.  The second service is IBM Watson Care Manager, which allows the patient to provide personalized care and treatment. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>IBM Watson Health Cloud for Life Sciences Compliance</b> will significantly improve the efficiency and speed of certification of biomedical research.  This, in turn, will accelerate the launch of new medical products on the market.  Now the emergence of a new medical drug on the market is associated with a huge number of procedural and bureaucratic elements, which slows down this process.

      <br>
      In addition, the service helps companies accelerate the implementation of infrastructure and applications that meet security standards for the use of IT equipment for medical purposes, which will meet stringent requirements for hosting, access and data exchange. <br><br>  <b>IBM Watson Care Manager</b> is a combination of Watson Health, Apple HealthKit and ResearchKit.  The last two platforms are Applt Corporation development, which facilitates research using an iPhone smartphone.  The IBM service, which combines all the capabilities of these platforms, opens up a number of prospects for medical companies and medical workers to create an individualized treatment and patient care program. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWatson Health opens up a new era of high-tech healthcare and is able to provide support to entrepreneurs and industry leaders in solving various problems both in the early stages of research and in the period of medical care.  The service covers a wide range of topics from disease prevention to public health promotion.  New partnerships and successful examples of the use of the IBM Watson Health Cloud emphasize the flexibility and scalability of a platform that can improve the quality of healthcare services provided, including preventive ones.  In addition, IBM Watson Health, with the help of new partners and services, and with the opening of the global headquarters, is seeking to expand the use of the platform to solve pressing global problems in the field of health care, ‚Äùsaid Michael Rhodin, senior vice president, IBM Watson Group. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/858/64a/f37/85864af3743e47eb89c8f24ec0221340.jpg" width="620"><br><br>  Watson Health is now working with companies such as Best Doctors, Modernizing Medicine, Pathway Genomics, Socrates and Welltok.  The corporation also agreed on a partnership with Boston Children's Hospital, Columbia University, ICON plc, Sage Bionetworks and Teva Pharmaceuticals.  Some partner projects relate to the pharmaceutical field (the creation of new drugs), individual treatment, monitoring and treatment of chronic diseases, medical gadgets. <br><br>  Five months have passed since the start of IBM Watson Health, and during this time, the software platform has gained hundreds of partners, ecosystem members and users. <br><br>  An important point is the participation of the Columbia University Medical Center in the IBM Watson testing program.  The goal set by the Center's management is to use the patient's genome analysis data to create an individual treatment program.  Here, the early diagnosis of cancer, the identification of mutations in cancer cells and the characteristics of the patient‚Äôs body are of crucial importance. <br><br>  At the international headquarters of Watson Health about 700 IBM employees will work on projects of various types. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/267967/">https://habr.com/ru/post/267967/</a></p>
