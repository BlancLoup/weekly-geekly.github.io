    <h4>  File storage </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/36a/63b/b15/36a63bb150c3a621b7cabe6b4f09a13f.png" alt="image"><br>  The Jahia file storage was completely rewritten in version 6. In Jahia 5, the storage was based <br>  on the use of the library <i>Apache Slide library</i> , which at that time was de facto <br>  standard open source file repositories. <br><br>  But it makes it possible for the rapid development and good quality of <i>Apache Jackrabbit</i> - implementation <br>  Java Content Repository specification, Jahia 6 began to use it as a standard <br>  file storage and build your services on top of this library.  Actually architecture <br>  Jackrabbit does not imply a close dependence on its use, but uses standard JCR <br>  API for accessing various repositories. <br><br>  In Jahia 6, it became possible to have access to <i>CIFS / SMB file storage</i> .  Some others <br>  developing implementations are available in sandbox repositories (sandbox repositories), among them <br>  <i>FTP connectors, Alfresco, Exo Platform, Nuxeo</i> . <br><br>  In the image above, you can note that the content of Jahia (Jahia Content) is available as <br>  <i>JCR provider</i> , this is also a new feature of Jahia 6. So far, in this direction has been held <br>  only initial compatibility work and the interface to this implementation cannot <br>  boast high performance, but work to improve it will be carried out constantly from <br>  version to version. <br><br>  On top of the file storage service, the interfaces submit content using various technologies: <br>  WebDAV, viewing files in templates and in Jahia‚Äôs AJAX user interface.  Together with the repository <br>  Additional portal services can function: <i>Rules engine</i> - to set rules and <br>  file permissions, <i>Thumbnail management</i> - to generate thumbnails of images <br>  (thumbnail), <i>Content extractors</i> - for extracting metadata. <br><br><h4>  Tools and tools (engines) </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/38d/a8b/61c/38da8b61cb09ee704058e862f2651331.gif" alt="image"><br>  Tools and tools in Jahia are called <i>engines</i> .  Jahia engines can <br>  compare with <i>Action</i> objects in Struts.  These are blocks of application logic, each of which <br>  performs a specific task.  <i>Sub-engines</i> are even smaller blocks, <br>  controlling interaction with user interface primitives (for example, controlling <br>  edit field). <br><br>  The most important engine is the <i>Core engine</i> , which is responsible for generating <br>  page content, it is called every time the portal should display the page.  Titles <br>  other engines speak for themselves: for example, the <i>Login</i> and <i>Logout</i> engines are responsible for <br>  drawing the user interface for logging in and out of the system and processing the data entered <br>  user with these actions. <br><br>  <i>Content editing engines are</i> integrated with the validation framework. <br>  (validation framework), which allows integrators to set validation rules entered <br>  user data. <br><br>  The engines are also integrated with a custom AJAX interface.  The purpose of AJAX is to make <br>  modern user interface, built on components that can be repeatedly <br>  reuse.  Integrators will be able to use the already existing numerous libraries. <br>  components when building applications.  Work in this direction started in Jahia 6 using <br>  GWT components. <br><br>  <i>Sub engines</i> in Jahia are used to display container editing interfaces. <br>  A container can contain different types of fields.  When editing a field of any type <br>  Container editing engine (container edition engine) refers to the subdvizhku responsible for <br>  this type of field.  For example, a <i>file</i> type field representing a file will provide a UI <br>  an interface that allows the user to browse directories and select files, while the field <br>  <i>Small text</i> type will simply display a <i>text</i> box. <br><br>  Jahia processes requests to the engines using the <i>‚Äú/ engineName‚Äù</i> parameter in the URL.  If the parameter <br>  without value - the request is accepted by <i>the kernel engine</i> .  String values ‚Äã‚Äãthat are used for <br>  engine naming conventions are declared by the engines themselves, and in the <i>JahiaEngine</i> class, <i>the getName method</i> <i><br></i>  <i>()</i> will determine the key for the mechanism for resolving the / engineName parameter. <br><br><h4>  Search and indexing subsystem </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0c1/d62/9cd/0c1d629cd5320d544969400b46f3e1f4.png" alt="image"><br>  The search and indexing subsystem Jahia in this document will be presented only briefly - this <br>  very extensive subsystem.  Above in the figure we illustrated the main components of this <br>  subsystems. <br><br>  The innovation of Jahia 6 is the integration of the <i>OpenSearch</i> standard.  Jahia can play a role like <br>  <i>consumer</i> , as well as the <i>generator</i> OpenSearch requests.  This means that users <br>  can, for example, integrate Jahia into <i>your browser‚Äôs search bar</i> and directly do <br>  search queries from the browser panel.  On the other hand, Jahia can use the services <br>  different OpenSearch providers and provide aggregated search results on one page. <br>  by Jahia, Google, MSN, etc. <br><br>  As for more traditional web search solutions, Jahia offers <i>tag libraries</i> for <br>  search content either in a simple full-text search format, or using advanced <br>  search queries.  To facilitate the formation of advanced search queries in Jahia UI components <br>  built-in convenient <i>query parameters selectors</i> .  These components are made using <br>  AJAX framework and are similar to those used to enter data in the interface <br>  login <br><br>  Another alternative for querying content objects is to directly <i>embed queries at the level</i> <i><br></i>  <i>templates</i> , and users on the screen will see the result of the already prepared request.  it <br>  called <i>Container Queries</i> and they can be used, for example, <br>  to load the last five content objects from the ‚ÄúNews‚Äù type when displaying the latest <br>  five news. <br><br>  At the heart of all these technologies of forming user requests are server systems, <br>  directly performing content search and indexing.  The search engine portal gives <br>  the ability to perform full-text search, search with refinement queries as the content <br>  Jahia, and file content. <br><br>  The basis of the subsystem search and indexing - opensource frameworks <i>Compass</i> and <i>Apache</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Lucene</i> .  They store their index using file system tools, but also have tools <br>  to store information in databases or distributed file systems. <br><br>  The standard implementation of the subsystem using the file system is currently the most <br>  efficient and production-ready, so Jahia comes with <br>  this implementation. <br><br><h4>  Administration </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/170/036/947/170036947539550220494af0963266d4.gif" alt="image"><br>  <i>The administration interface</i> is a management tool for all the different subsystems of Jahia. <br>  from one place for both site administrators and server administrators.  Interface <br>  administration allows the administrator to perform all kinds of tasks: <br><ul><li>  create, update, delete users, groups, sites and categories; </li><li>  set global permissions; </li><li>  set permissions on templates and portlets, split templates and portlets on <br>  categories; </li><li>  view the internal cache status and reset it; </li><li>  set a password assignment policy; </li><li>  determine the site languages; </li><li>  configure the ability to remotely publish content; </li><li>  perform other functions described in detail in the Administrator‚Äôs Guide <br>  (Administrator's guide). </li></ul><br>  The administration interface is based on a <i>servlet manager</i> and a <i>collection of classes</i> , <br>  controlling UI for various server settings.  Also for the convenience of administrators interface <br>  supports user interface components on AJAX. <br><br><h4>  Spring integration </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/66a/05d/fe6/66a05dfe6400683d893c4a3eae855d5a.gif" alt="image"><br>  Jahia developers love Spring.  Since the fifth version of the system, Jahia has been integrated with <br>  <i>Spring Framework</i> to facilitate the construction of complete, fast and flexible portal solutions. <br><br>  To connect Jahia subsystems to numerous services, integrators now simply follow <br>  use well-known mechanisms for tuning and dependency injection (dependency injection), <br>  which provides Spring. <br><br>  The figure above explains the settings that can be used to initialize everything using Spring. <br>  various subsystems Jahia.  External libraries of the portal: Apache Pluto, Hibernate, Apache Lucene - <br>  also work with Spring, which makes it possible to implement a harmonious portal architecture. <br><br>  The experience of integrating Jahia with Spring was a success, and almost no dependencies on Spring‚Äôs system <br>  appeared, which makes it possible in the future, if necessary, to freely migrate to another <br>  framework <br><br><h4>  Event listeners and rules </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/728/f79/f64/728f79f6469c99c46c4f610a0e3cf756.png" alt="image"><br>  <i>Actions</i> performed by portal users generate <i>events</i> that can <br>  used to perform certain tasks.  Jahia allows integrators to register their <br>  event listeners.  The graph above shows how events are transmitted along various <br>  subsystems and how they can be used by developers. <br><br>  An event is fired when a certain action is performed by the portal.  This could be a <i>command.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>user</i> , <i>scheduled action</i> , <i>background process</i> .  Action causes <br>  <i>event generator (event generator)</i> to create an event object.  This object will be further <br>  transferred to the <i>listeners registry</i> , which is registered listeners <br>  will call the required classes.  Some of the event listeners are <i>gateways</i> to <br>  other listeners using other technologies.  It is possible to use the event listener <br>  <i>Groovy (Groovy event listener)</i> , allowing the integrator to use Groovy's language <br>  listener implementations;  A <i>JSP event listener</i> that does the same for <br>  JSP pages. <br><br>  Another specific listener is the <i>JCR observation manager</i> , <br>  which links the Jahia event mechanism with the standard JCR observation model. <br>  Under this implementation is the <i>JBoss Rules observer (JBoss rules observer)</i> , <br>  allowing integrators to use rules for event handling. <br><br><h4>  Request Processing in Jahia </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/381/daa/7d3/381daa7d3b5f3623977902b71a4cb94f.gif" alt="image"><br>  Above is a diagram of Jahia‚Äôs processing a request from a browser.  Scheme can be used <br>  developers to determine the portal subsystems involved in the processing of a specific <br>  request. <br><br>  The browser request can be sent either to the <i>Jahia servlet</i> or to the <i>WebDAV servlet</i> <br>  (if a binary file is requested). <br><br>  In the second case ( <i>WebDAV servlet</i> ), the request will be redirected to the file storage service, <br>  will be validated for the right to access the requested resource and then the result will be returned <br>  back to the browser. <br><br>  In the first case, <i>Jahia servlet</i> will be called.  Jahia will immediately create <i>a context object.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>(context object)</i> called <i>"ParamBean"</i> .  This will contain all <br>  information about the request, including such things as the requested page, current user, language <br>  view and so on.  Internally, ParamBean uses <i>a pipelined mechanism (pipeline</i> <i><br></i>  <i>mechanism)</i> for user permission.  Mechanism customizable to integrate others <br>  technology user permissions, the details of this mechanism are described in the section "Conveyors". <br><br>  After creating the ParamBean object, Jahia transfers control to the <i>OperationManager</i> object, <br>  which also uses a pipeline.  The action pipeline is described later in this document in <br>  relevant section.  Conveyor operations will interact with Jahia services for <br>  performing the desired actions, and the result will depend on which engines were called in <br>  conveyor. <br>  In the case of using the kernel engine, the action pipeline will create all the necessary content objects, <br>  giving the template developer the content that he will post on JSP pages.  therefore <br>  after forming the content objects, the portal directs the user request to the JSP template for <br>  page rendering. <br><br>  Finally, the final result is sent back to the browser. <br><br>  Naturally, this is a very simplified example of the operation of the portal, but it can serve as a basis for understanding <br>  query processing schemes in Jahia.  Portal interaction with caches has been omitted to simplify <br>  description of the process, but it is obvious that integrators will have to take them into account when developing <br>  their portal solutions. <br><br><h4>  Conveyors </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/066/176/bfe/066176bfe2636eb7abeb96885e8b35a9.png" alt="image"><br>  As mentioned in the previous section, Jahia uses pipelines to provide <br>  custom processing chains.  <i>A conveyor</i> is an ordered list of levels (valves, <br>  valves), which in turn are called one after another.  What is template specific <br>  Pipeline design pattern is something that everyone‚Äôs responsibility <br>  level is to cause the following.  In other words, the level can choose to pass execution <br>  next or not. <br><br>  <i>The authentication pipeline is</i> invoked by the ParamBean object to determine the user <br>  based on current context.  Users can be defined using all <br>  methods: this is a search for information in the saved sessions, if they have been previously defined;  or with <br>  using integrated single sign-on such as CAS, or using container authentication <br>  JEE.  In the figure above, the lower pipeline is the authentication pipeline, it shows various levels for <br>  user definitions.  We will not go into the details of each level, but it is worth noting that <br>  This resolution mechanism is customizable using Spring xml files, which is <br>  integrators apply their own levels. <br><br>  <i>The action pipeline</i> (top of picture) is used in Jahia to provide <br>  connected request processing chains.  Pipeline levels may decide to stop <br>  processing the request at any point, which is especially important when working with the cache.  If the content can <br>  read from the cache, the request processing is suspended in this place, and this frees the server from <br>  performing unnecessary operations, making the request processing process very efficient.  Level <br>  the pipeline that is responsible for reading from the cache in the figure is called <i>"Frame Assembler" (Skeleton</i> <i><br></i>  <i>aggregator)</i> .  The <i>URL history</i> pipeline level is used to record all URLs, <br>  requested by the user in order to build the navigation chain (breadcrumbs). <br><br>  Integrators may find it interesting to customize the action pipeline for expansion. <br>  functionality involved in processing user requests.  It should be noted that <br>  the order of placement of levels in the pipeline is very important, and that it is not recommended to change this order without <br>  deep understanding of the principles of the portal Jahia. <br><br><h4>  Import and export </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5ce/9e4/a34/5ce9e4a34876655d67c70038c0148fca.gif" alt="image"><br>  The Jahia portal import and export subsystem is a powerful mechanism for migrating content to various <br>  ways between Jahia websites or even between different system installations. <br><br>  To export content, the system uses the Jml-170 (or JCR) data storage format, along with <br>  other specific files (such as file hierarchies for exporting binary data).  All these <br>  files are compressed into a zip-archive, which can be used in the import subsystem. <br><br>  Standardized import and export mechanism makes it possible to export a complete installation. <br>  Jahia, a set of sites, a single sat or even one section of the site;  move content between sites and <br>  sections of Jahia sites;  export and import it into non-jahia system. <br><br>  Jahia also uses import and export technology to <i>enable remote publishing.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>content</i> .  In this case, the import (export) of the content is usually called by the scheduler. <br>  tasks.  The import and export technology can recognize when the content has been changed, and in such <br>  case simply updates the content object instead of creating a new one. <br><br><h5>  RELATION TO COPY / PASTE </h5><br>  Although not obvious, the copy / paste function also uses an import and export system.  The <br>  fact clarifies why content can only be copied and pasted between <i>compatible</i> <i><br></i>  <i>content descriptions</i> , since Jahia needs to know how to convert content between source <br>  and a content receiver. <br><br>  <i>Linked copies</i> also use the import and export system when <br>  sending content to the receiver (receiver). <br><br><h4>  Clustering </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/072/233/aec/072233aec96c6eb22b86f2285313cfdf.png" alt="image"><br>  Deploying the Jahia system to a cluster is an effective way to reduce the load on the central <br>  the processor and memory for ensuring work of the high-loaded sites. <br><br>  A typical Jahia installation on a cluster is shown in the figure above.  Jahia nodes exchange directly <br>  each other (direct messaging) and have access to shared resources: the file system and database <br>  data. <br><br>  The file system is used to store the <i>search index</i> and to store the <i>binary</i> <i><br></i>  <i>data</i> (if the server is configured to store binary data in the file system, the <i>configuration by</i> <i><br></i>  <i>default - storage in the database</i> ). <br><br>  Everything else is stored in the database.  Therefore, it is very important to have a high-performance installation. <br>  database to ensure good scalability of the entire system. <br><br>  Jahia can also distinguish nodes by type in a cluster to provide more specialized <br>  processing.  Consider briefly the various types of nodes. <br><br><h5>  NODES VIEWING </h5><br>  <i>View nodes (Jahia "browsing" nodes)</i> are specialized Jahia nodes that are <br>  function as content publishing nodes.  They also interact with portlets for <br>  page rendering.  Using this type of node allows you to separate the load on the issuance system <br>  content from the load on the authorization system and the background query processing system. <br><br><h5>  AUTHORIZATION NODES </h5><br>  <i>Authorization nodes (Jahia "authoring" nodes)</i> are cluster nodes that are also used when <br>  viewing and editing portal content.  This is the <i>most commonly used</i> type. <br>  node in the Jahia cluster, so you need to have several instances of such nodes so that <br>  to distribute the load. <br><br><h5>  HANDLING NODES </h5><br>  In Jahia, long-running tasks (these are document validation actions (workflow validation) <br>  operations), copy / paste operations, content importing and indexing) are performed as <i>background</i> <i><br></i>  <i>processes</i> .  Thus, when performing these lengthy operations, other nodes can still <br>  handle requests to view and edit content. <br><br><h5>  INDEXING SERVER </h5><br>  Indexing content and files can be a very expensive operation. <br>  CPU and load on the server RAM.  For example, to index <br>  pdf file the server must run the scripts that are contained in the file in order to extract <br>  text content.  This requires the execution of a Postscript-like language, including <br>  memory management and processing instructions, just to extract content.  Indexing <br>  large files also require memory that cannot be freed until completion <br>  open file. <br><br>  Indexing is usually referred to as an operation that does not require performing in real <br>  time, so it runs in the background.  In order to reduce the load on the Jahia server, <br>  processing current user requests, it is highly recommended to install <br>  separate content index server. <br><br>  You can even install multiple index server nodes on the system to ensure <br>  uninterrupted performance of this operation. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/81884/">https://habr.com/ru/post/81884/</a></p>
