They have already published my <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/arbeit/41421/">"Higher Time Management"</a> and wanted to continue.  For two years I struggled with management theory, tested it in my business, changed it, reworked it.  During this time, the article turned into a book, which, I hope, will be released in late 2006.  (now the end of 2008, I have one and a half books - and I want to print only one, therefore I am here for thoughts) But I did not forget about the article.  She is in front of you.  It has the same name as my future, not yet born book - ‚ÄúThe Tao of a Businessman‚Äù.  It is not by chance, all this time it seemed to me that harmony should not leave business, that business should strive for inner beauty.  I was very pleased to see this in practice and form a theory of incarnation.  I work in one of the most open and fast spheres of human activity - I manage Internet projects.  In my world, greed and disrespect for people have truly devastating consequences.  I have experience with completely unmanageable employees, many of whom work at night, sleep three times a day and in winter go in T-shirts in the cold.  And I know that this world has no way to live differently, to love differently.  I'm happy. <br><br>  With best regards to all readers of the magazine <s>‚ÄúCompany Management‚Äù,</s> HabraHabra Alexey Mas

Listen to the inner voice of your employees (their unspoken desires). <br>  Stomp the trail into your subconscious.  Trust the intuition.  Use the methods of working with intuition (feed your intuition - indulge her in her desires, trust, educate her). <br>  Create your own privacy.  Work at night, work when privacy is possible, appreciate it (sturdy door, correct secretary). <br><br><h6>  Plans <br></h6>  ‚ÄúGoals should be poured out of concrete, and plans should be written in the sand‚Äù (the one who said - said very true). <br>  Plans absorb your energy - plan to love. <br>  Choose the means after selecting the targets.  When you develop a plan, think about ‚Äúwhat‚Äù you would like to achieve, and only then ‚Äúhow‚Äù (what you want is always different from what you have achieved).  Start from desires, and look for opportunities under them, and not vice versa. <br><br><h6>  Periods: <br></h6>  With proper organization of work, be guided only by monthly or annual plans.  But in anticipation of the ideal - plan every day. <br>  The plans of the main continuity and the absence of cavities - "holes", as well as the relationship of close-ups with detailed.  If the plans will breakdown - then the energy will go there. <br><br><h5>  Way will <br></h5><h6>  Be persistent. </h6>  Good deeds are done over the years, it is only possible to go broke in 5 minutes. <br>  Pre-invest strength, energy, time, money (finish things beautiful).  Do not leave spaces in the cases, otherwise you risk finding them out of shape (like a balloon, the case is blown away).  Let the presence of imperfection in business values ‚Äã‚Äãyour heart, not your mind (harmony is the business of the soul, not of the mind).  Glaziers determine the integrity of the glass by its ringing, intuitive leaders measure the harmony of the matter with the voice of the heart. <br>  Achieve ideality, it is the pursuit of ideality that separates talent from mediocrity (uncompromising ideality).  Talents will not work in your organization if they understand that you are not a fighter for perfection. <br>  Will is a way to keep the right direction at the moments when you need to change course (will is the grip of tires with the road).  Will is very important with vigorous movement.  But the deterrent method (will) is not effective and durable.  A more advanced method is the management of energy (desire).  The will forms walls against which your and other people's energy breaks down, and damages health (I managed to get sick, testing the method of developing my will).  Manage your energy, inspire your employees.  Talented people do not contain walls and do not allow others to build walls in front of them.  Talent is not motivated by necessity, talent is motivated by desire ‚Äî positively (inspiration is all you can do for it). <br>  The head should limit the tasks of his immediate subordinates, and not multiply them.  Leadership is a calling to show the way.  And what is the ability to choose the path, if not cutting off unnecessary roads? <br><br><h6>  Give up. </h6>  <b>Take the most important thing.</b>  Do not read into each page, they are not equivalent.  The meaning is not on every page of the book. <br>  Dismiss employees with the same enthusiasm as you hire them. <br>  Close projects with the same passion as open new ones. <br>  Limit the number of entities - and concentration will come to you. <br><br><h4>  Energy <br></h4><br>  Motivation is the science of satisfaction.  What exactly gives you and your customers pleasure? <br>  Two principles: <br>  - To love everyone (unselfishly and just like that) <br>  - Believe in yourself <br><br><h5>  Love everyone <br></h5>  See your dreams in other people's dreams.  Start the mission of the company with the dreams of your employees and the dreams of your customers.  He who believes in the dreams of others controls everything. <br>  God gave us love, and only our crazy hands made her greed. <br>  If you exude love, love will return to you, if you exude greed, only greed will return. <br>  Love allows the people around us to be themselves, to manifest fully and to the end. <br>  Communicate with people, keep in touch.  In order to be a man of influence, you need only one thing - to listen to other people. <br><br><h5>  Believe in yourself <br></h5>  Others cannot be sure of you any more than you are sure of yourself. <br>  Man exists to believe in himself. <br>  Believe in your employees.  Faith even God makes those who he is. <br><br>  Practice: <br><h6>  Secure success.  Collect victories </h6>  (nothing motivates us as our own success). <br><br><h6>  Study yourself. </h6><h6>  Take decisive action. </h6>  I thought, so I did.  This is an action formula. "I felt = I thought = I said = I did" <br>  Our body is created in such a way that: thinking about one thing, and doing another, it is impossible to stay healthy. <br>  This principle organizes both thoughts and deeds.  To think - this is a string of string.  If you thought, but did not, then the "arrow of action" dug into your heart. <br><br><h4>  freedom <br></h4>  Freedom is a state of mind when any road you go leads you to your goal. <br>  There are only two freedoms: <br>  - Freedom from the past <br>  - Freedom from the future <br><br><h5>  Freedom from the past <br></h5><br><h6>  Use springboards for radical transformations: </h6>  new year, new diary, new thing, all that your subconscious can catch on to push off and fly. <br><br><h6>  Lack of inspiration - there is a drop in the abyss of consumption </h6>  .  Avoid consumption.  What you consume is already dead.  Consumption litters vital channels.  Do not mix matters; every thing like a snake has a tail, in the past and in the future.  You will get a suffocating loop if you put several snakes in one basket. <br><h6>  Create completeness </h6>  so old things let you go. <br><br><h5>  Freedom from the future <br></h5><br><h6>  Love your mistakes. </h6>  Everything that is done with a pure heart can be redone. <br>  Imagine everything, literally everything, but do not let the shadow of sorrow fall on your heart. <br><br><h6>  Be motivated by caring for people, not your own worth. </h6>  Significance can be lost and you can worry about the fact that it can be lost.  Take care of people - you can always. <br><br><h6>  Practice change. </h6>  If you stand, the past will catch up with you from behind, and the future will squeeze you in front.  Get moving to create space for action.  Intuition is that part of the consciousness that is constantly in motion.  Draw, dance, sing - to open your eyes to your soul. <br>  Making a decision frees the mind.  Nothing clutters up the brain like unadopted decisions. <br>  Love the uncertainty. <br>  Create and be happy! <br><br>  Posted by: Alex Mas (alexeymas@gmail.com) <br><br>  The text was published in the magazine "Company Management" 1, 2006 <br>  This text is dear to me to some extent, so I will willingly accept comments and remarks on habrapost in paper envelopes and in any other way. <br><br>  Also <br>  <a href="http://www.mas.kiev.ua/text/UK_01_06_DAO.pdf">read in pdf</a> (or see how it was made in the journal): <br>  on the author's website: <a href="http://www.mas.kiev.ua/dao.html">www.mas.kiev.ua/dao.html</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/44613/">https://habr.com/ru/post/44613/</a></p>
