  <section class="page js-page"><h1>India becomes the center of offshore journalism</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Indian websites are full of vacancies: ‚ÄúA business journalist is required.  The ability to work on the night shift (British time) is welcome. "  In India, Singapore and other countries with cheap labor there appeared a huge number of vacancies for ‚Äúremote editors‚Äù who know English.  All they need for work is Internet access.  The so-called <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/11/19/business/outsource.php">offshore journalism is becoming a fashionable trend</a> in the western publishing business. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Now even medium and small publishers are trying to resort to outsourcing in order to reduce costs.  As you know, the print media industry is <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/lenta/1035/">going through hard times</a> today: circulation is reduced, advertising revenues are falling, so they have to count every dollar. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.wan-press.org/">The World Association of Newspapers has</a> recognized that outsourcing today "plays an important role in the newspaper industry."  Actually, it can be seen with the naked eye.  Even in Russia today, many newspapers have a staff of employees who never visit the office.  If the Hindus knew Russian, then probably half of Moscow journalism would have moved to Mumbai long ago. <br><br>  In addition to editors, designers, photo editors and other creative professions are being transferred to outsourcing.  Customers include not only print media, but also online publications.  In India, the first large firms, such as <a href="http://www.expresskcs.com/">Express KCS</a> , have emerged that specialize in finding personnel for remote work in the field of journalism and publishing.  Some of them even included the prices for writing texts in the <a href="http://hitechexport.com//price.php">general price list for remote work</a> .

      More than two years ago, the largest news agency <a href="http://www.reuters.com/">Reuters</a> opened a branch for 340 jobs in Bangalore, the center of Indian outsourcing.  The branch performs one task: it issues a stream of news about American companies based on their financial statements.  These are standard news about corporate earnings, higher / lower profits compared with the previous quarter, etc.  The Bangalore branch has proven itself so well that its staff has now been increased to 1,600.  Each employee receives five to six times less salary than his American counterpart.  True, not all of these people write about finance: after all, a <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/bb3ac0f6-2e15-11db-93ad-0000779e2340.html">special software has</a> now been released that does an excellent job with financial journalism instead of a person. <br><br>  Some Western journalists are worried that their work is flowing abroad.  But in fact, there is no reason to panic.  This is a natural process, the development of which we observed in the field of software development.  There, too, panic sentiments first appeared, and then the industry adapted and continued normal development. <br><br>  The fact is that only the lowest paid jobs that require the most unskilled labor are transferred to India.  Thanks to this, professional Western journalists (as well as professional programmers before them) can get rid of the routine and get into the real work. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4700/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4700/</a></p>
