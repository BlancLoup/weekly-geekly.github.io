He began to think - why not agree? <br><br>  There was a technical issue, as there are a lot of cameras with the ability to shoot video in 3d at the moment, but no one was going to pay the corresponding costs.  The issue of mounting 4K video is also quite expensive.  Therefore, it was decided to look for an inexpensive solution with FHD resolution. <br><br>  And here I again received another call, customers were satisfied with the FHD resolution video.  Of all the pioneers, I knew the Ricoh theta camera the most - it has YouTube compatibility listed in the description, which means there will be fewer problems.  At the same time let's see how it can give the quality of photos compared to my kit <br>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/272910/">geektimes.ru/post/272910</a>

      I received the camera from the official representative of Ricoh in St. Petersburg, for which many thanks to him and a huge plus in karma!  Then everything is in order. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The kit consists of a camera, a charger and a case. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/71b/2f6/a96/71b2f6a96e7b4d34bd420287dc6fe10b.jpg"><br><br>  A cover made of special fabric and plays a double role: first, protective, since the lenses bulge strongly, and it seems very easy to damage them (I do not advise putting the camera sideways), and secondly, it rubs the same lenses from dirt inside.  The camera is made of a nice touch plastic, it does not slip out of hand under any circumstances, but easily gets dirty and collects prints.  In his hand, he is perfect, looks like such a small toy from the side.  Without knowing the cost, I never would have thought that such a toy could cost 30,000 rubles, but you need to get used to it, which is now ‚Äúonly‚Äù $ 458, and the price is not that big in principle.  There are no complaints about the build quality, except plastic crunch in the hands - apparently, such a construction. <br><br>  Ricoh theta S can work both independently and in conjunction with a smartphone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1a2/70f/03a/1a270f03a1d245d89e86875cf76ff55e.jpg"><br><br>  Together with the phone you can view pictures in live view.  There are a couple of LEDs on the camera itself in order to understand whether the video is being filmed, the photo is on, whether Wi-Fi is on.  Yes, by the way, the camera has a router mode, and to connect a smartphone you will have to disconnect from the Wi-Fi network used.  The pairing is set up quite simply, the application doesn‚Äôt spoil much of the various possibilities: take photos and videos, send them to the cloud or YouTube (which I never did).  For photo editing there is a separate application THETA + <br><br>  In fact, the application is unstable, sometimes it did not work for a few minutes to connect to the smartphone.  In principle, after the first minutes of the hang, it became clear that it was better not to use a camera to work with a smartphone.  I decided to shoot separately, and the material to throw off directly on the PC.  For this, by the way, you need to install a separate driver and a couple of programs. <br><br>  Photo quality <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/99b/19d/787/99b19d7877f9473da5421a10545b385d.jpg"><br><br>  I, of course, not shocked, but pleasantly surprised.  Panoramas are quite working, the stitching lines can be seen only with very small space (for example, with a panorama in the refrigerator).  Light and shadow are great too!  There is no strong glare in the bright sun, the shadows are also extended in some programmatic way.  The most convenient thing for which I adapted the camera at work is a quick survey of car interiors - if there is a central armrest, this is a matter of one minute.  See a comparison of shooting in my kit with a panoramic head and theta s.  Here, of course, one cannot do without a smartphone as a remote control, but then it was possible to connect without any problems. <br><br>  Video quality <br><br>  <a href="https://youtu.be/yN54scj4k1U">youtu.be/yN54scj4k1U</a> - example video <br><br>  Divide full HD by 2 and 4 - something like this is obtained resolution.  If you use the approximation in the video, it is very, very small.  Of course, the camera has a wide tonal balance, but all this is useless.  I did not offer such a video to the client. <br><br>  The bottom line is video for entertainment only. <br><br>  When the camera had to be returned, I had a double feeling.  On the one hand, I broke off the video - there is no budget for 4K equipment, I also deleted this service from the next year. <br><br>  On the other hand, the quality of the photo is worthy for the client, especially for the greedy one) It would be very convenient for me to carry with me a light tripod with a wearing aunt instead of a panoramic head with sony nex.  But then the question of price arises: my nex 3 set with the head and Samyang 8mm cost me about 30 thousand. So I never found any reasons to switch or use theta S in my work. <br><br>  I think that this camera will be a great companion in campaigns and travels in remote places of the planet - you can quickly upload photos to google panoramas.  I personally took advantage of this feature, it has never been so easy to load a panorama onto maps. <br><br>  Well, just a photo camera and examples of panoramas. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/29a/9a4/502/29a9a45029c74a4fac1294fe73473704.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/183/9b9/dc1/1839b9dc1f2b4014acc266c9baea775e.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ad4/2b3/aec/ad42b3aec35b46d28054cc8936963c42.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c44/1d2/554/c441d255408a431aaf68cbc723536805.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ce0/ffd/448/ce0ffd448f2042fda1d2fef8ca54006b.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cd8/407/19b/cd840719b99c409e9998b68521079e38.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/38c/253/56f/38c25356f770477dbde80747a27d0b52.jpg"><br><br>  Panorama - <a href="https://goo.gl/photos/vVLAtVM55jqUhHtf8">goo.gl/photos/vVLAtVM55jqUhHtf8</a> <br><br>  Trofimov Ilya piter360.ru </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/397717/">https://habr.com/ru/post/397717/</a></p>
