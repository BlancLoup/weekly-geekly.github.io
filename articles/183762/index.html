But back in 1995, when the pump was pumped by long-distance calls on a regular phone line, the sceners were already arrested for pirating Microsoft and Novell products.  The sceners themselves wrote about this in the so-called ‚Äúwarez journals,‚Äù which were distributed through the same BBS. <br><br>  One of these magazines was released by the DoD group (Drink or Die), which for a long time was the number one team in the global cutting scene.  They were engaged in hacking and distributing programs.  The group differed from others in that back in 1993 it was not organized by Americans or Europeans, but by a Moscow guy named Misha (aka Jimmy Jamez, aka Deviator).  In 2001, all the main participants in the group were arrested during Operation Buccaneer.  Jimmy Jamez had already retired. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Details about the birth and the best days of the group <a href="http://bugtraq.ru/library/underground/dod.html">wrote</a> mindw0rk in 2005.  I will copy the main part of the article here for convenience:

    <div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">extract from mindw0rk article</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  In April 1993, at the Moscow apartment, where Deviator met with his cracker friends (one of them was the notorious Baphomet), the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating a new group appeared.  Micah already knew all the moves and exits on the warez scene and wanted to make his own label, not to be dependent on anyone.  Since pals, like any Russian, liked to skip a glass, the name became characteristic: Drink or Die.  Deviator then admitted that initially he planned to create not just a group, but a whole underground computer empire.  And even made a plan how to embody an ambitious goal. <br><br>  For the first months, DOD was studying the scene and its representatives in order to take its place among the American and European teams and make them a worthy competition.  In the summer of 1993, Micah changed his nickname to Jimmy Jamez - it was under this name that he was known throughout the following years on the world crack scene. <br><br>  <b>Early years DOD</b> <br><br>  The first official release of DOD was released in May 93rd Krak for the popular BBS PCBoard package.  At that time, most reputable Crack groups specialized in creating a variety of PPE (Packet Processing Engine) for PCBoard.  It could be variations of the BBS interface or useful utilities for admins.  Successful PPE-programmers were considered to be the very unattainable for mere mortals elite.  Drink or Die was no exception, and after a short time it became one of the most active PPE groups. <br><br>  At first, DOD was exclusively a Russian team.  Jimmy rallied his friends around him, many of whom he knew personally.  Everything changed by the end of 1993. Micha realized that for further development it was necessary to build partnerships with foreign sceners.  And the first with whom he established contacts were the Danish Silverado BBS and the German Darkness BBS.  These nodes were the first distributors of DOD releases in Europe, and it was through them that the whole world learned about the group. <br><br>  In addition to PPE-projects, DOD specialized in computer game trainers.  Together with TRSi, it first introduced the cheat options built into the game menu (usually they were either in the bootloader, or delivered as a separate program). <br><br>  Jimmy Jamez's trading talents fed the group a continuous influx of fresh software.  The leader of DOD and his close friends were regular visitors to the legendary cracker boards Mirage, Gates of Asgard, Unlawful Entry, where they communicated with the "elite" and exchanged warez.  Along with the reputation, the number of the group also grew.  In just one year, from a small handful of real-life buddies, Drink or Die has become one of the largest teams on the warez scene, with more than 60 active members.  This does not mean that the group accepted all indiscriminately.  On the contrary, the rules of admission were very strict and almost always into the well-established team they took only old friends who had a good reputation on the stage.  In fact, DOD was a kind of family, closed to outsiders, but friendly to "their".  The group was completely self-sufficient and practically did not use other people's services.  Only internal suppliers, and only their FTP and release distribution sites. <br><br>  <b>Networking</b> <br><br>  In mid-1994, Jimmy Jamez and his friend Abbot Dervish first discovered the Internet.  The guys sorted sites, went through FTP, visited the underground IRC channels ... it was obvious that the network was the future.  And the future of DOD must be inextricably linked to the Internet. <br><br>  First of all, Micah created his channel in IRC, open to outsiders, but known only in a narrow circle.  The second stage was the almost complete transition to the distribution of releases through the network.  At the beginning of 1995 there were a few vareznikov who mastered the Internet and used it in their work.  Most of Krakow still went through underground boards.  Since DOD became, in fact, the pioneers in this, they managed to pick up all the best suppliers for themselves and capture the attention of the first network users. <br><br>  Jimmy Jamez was very careful in all things.  Despite the fact that he lived in Russia, where there were no laws on software piracy, the guy never kept the hacked programs on his computer.  Also as a cover, he registered a private company that produces licensed software. <br><br>  1995 was a turning point for the group.  Drink or Die left a few long-time members to found their own called Prophecy.  At the same time, another Russian guy with the nickname Phoenix, the leader of Krak-Tyma Tyranny, suggested that Jimmy combine their groups for more fruitful work.  The result of this merger was a series of software cracks from IBM, Microsoft and Novell.  These releases quickly spread around the world, and Drink or Die was number one on the cutter stage.  Even people far from computers started talking about DOD, after the team released a hacked version of Windows 95 two weeks before the official release.  This incident was sucked into the press for a long time and the DOD label was advertised at every corner.  More than 380 releases and 3 GB of software in just one 1995th year - no other team could compare with DOD in activity.  But, since 1996, for Drink or Die, as well as for the rest of the scene, not the best days began. <br><br>  <b>Time for a change</b> <br><br>  When the Internet became open to all, the underground began to change rapidly.  The first changes became noticeable in the IRC, the channels of which were flooded with crowds of lamers who had no idea about the scene.  At the same time, a large number of new Krak groups appeared, regularly producing Krakis, serials, trainers and other similar things.  Maintaining the reputation of the best of its kind has become difficult - DOD releases simply drowned in the mass.  Leaders of Drink or Die Jimmy Jamez and Cyber ‚Äã‚ÄãAngel left the stage to professionally engage in web design, in their place came the new leader - Lester.  It took several months to re-form the team and save what was left.  Many began to talk about the end of the DOD era, but thanks to Lester's enthusiasm, the group continued to work, although not as actively as before. <br><br>  In mid-1996, the main suppliers and talented crackers returned to Drink or Die: The Pep, Tawni, Evil Tea, The Punisher.  After this merger, DOD began to quickly gain its former strength and by the winter again took the leading place in the charts.  In February 1997, the group released 54 major releases totaling 890 MB in one month.  And in 1999, the DVD Speed ‚Äã‚ÄãRipper became the most famous release of DOD, a cracker of a DVD copying code.  It appeared shortly before DeCSS - a similar program from the Norwegian cracker Jon Johansen, but received great fame. </div></div><br>  mindw0rk has written many other articles on hackers and on the scene, I recommend anyone interested to read, and we will return to Drink or Die, which, as already mentioned, have again gained popularity under the guidance of foreign leaders now.  One of them was the Englishman Hugh Griffiths (Hew Raymond Griffiths), known as BanDiDo, who lives in Australia, born in 1962, who also came to the scene during the BBS-ca.  I translated excerpts from an interview with him at the end of 1999. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2d4/538/2ca/2d45382ca42f9c80db1f06582eb645e7.png"><br>  <sub>logo DoD "post-Russian" period</sub> <br><br>  <b>Have you ever regretted the time spent on stage?</b> <br><br>  Not.  For many years I have been online 12 hours a day, every day.  I did not regret a single minute. <br><br>  <b>What do you think is the main difference between the scene, what it was like when you started and today?</b> <br><br>  Well, it's simple.  Once upon a time the scene was truly elite.  You should have known someone who knows someone who knows the right person.  Then everything was serious.  And now millions of noobs flooded the scene.  New groups do not check their people, any idiot can join a group, get access to sites, it is very dangerous.  We have largely lost the former charm and secrecy.  I'm afraid the scene is now too open and few people pay due attention to the dangers associated with our business. <br><br>  <b>Have you ever been close to arrest or anything like that?</b>  <b>Were there incidents in your group?</b> <br><br>  There is nothing to arrest me for, I do not keep at home the warez ... And being in a group is not a crime.  However, I knew many who were arrested over the years.  Some because of their own stupidity, but most because of the "narc" -s.  This is another danger from which we suffer. <br><br>  <b>What does "narc" mean?</b> <br><br>  These are disgusting creatures who, for personal reasons, or for pleasure, are engaged in informing the authorities about the activities and / or personal data of those whom they call "friends."  Many sites and sceners have fallen victim to such vile types.  Unfortunately, the network attracts such scum, people with whom in real life no one would talk, and the anonymity of IRC creates an environment where they feel comfortable.  Some of us, however, still adhere to ethics and standards. <br><br>  <b>Did you have or have idols?</b> <br><br>  Oh, great sceners!  Let me tell you a story ... I remember how even in times of local BBS-ok I read nfo files ... all these names, mysterious nicknames ... then, after many years I was invited to the #DOD channel (I made a couple of supplies for them), and I saw some of those tech there.  It was like meeting a pop star, and until today, such legends as EViLTEA, Thepep, bob226 and many others remain my idols.  But I really appreciate my old friends - this is <b>bcre8tiv</b> , PsedO, fo_twenny and many more.  In short, true IRC friends are my idols. <br><br>  <b>What do you want to say in conclusion, or greet someone?</b> <br><br>  I say hello to everyone who still remains faithful to the real values ‚Äã‚Äãof the scene, I hope more people realize that we are playing a dangerous game.  We have ceased to be invisible underground society, and if you play with fire, you can burn yourself.  Remember, you must be damn sure who you are talking to in the chat, check everyone you are dealing with.  Be careful, these are not toys, but prison is a very unpleasant place ... <br><br><h4>  Roundtrip </h4><br>  As it turned out, Hugh was worried for a reason.  ‚ÄúBeing in a group‚Äù is still a crime, and it is called a ‚Äúcriminal conspiracy to violate copyright‚Äù.  As a result of the investigation into the activity of the ‚Äúunderground pirate network‚Äù Drink or Die, in 2003 the USA charged him and demanded extradition. <br><br>  It had a wide resonance.  For the first time in the United States from Australia, they demanded the extradition of not a runaway killer, not a member of an organized gang that stole millions of dollars, but a person who distributed pirated content on the Internet for free. <br><br>  For nearly three years, Hugh fought against extradition, being in an Australian prison, eventually lost, was taken to the United States and sentenced there for more than four years.  But since he had already actually spent three years in his homeland, he had only 15 months to spend behind the American bars.  Six months later, he was released on the occasion of the holiday (Australia Day), but was immediately put in a center for illegal immigrants.  After another 6 weeks, on March 2, 2008, he was finally expelled, and returned home, with a standard requirement, which in this case sounds particularly cynical: never to return to the United States again. <br><br>  But how was the activity of the group revealed?  We <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DrinkOrDie">read</a> about it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DrinkOrDie">in Wikipedia:</a> <br><br><blockquote>  Raids were carried out according to James Cudney, known as <b>Bcrea8tiv</b> .  James spent many years working under cover for the US customs, recording conversations in IRC chats, collecting detailed information about members of the DOD group and other warez groups. <br></blockquote><br>  Like this.  Hugh was afraid of the invasion of noobs, each of which could turn out to be an FBI scammer, and the man whom he considered the best friend had passed him and the whole group. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/183762/">https://habr.com/ru/post/183762/</a></p>
