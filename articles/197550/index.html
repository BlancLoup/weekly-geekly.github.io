      Everything is built on it in computers.  From the very first ‚Äúbinary,‚Äù that is, ‚Äúzero and one,‚Äù from processor technology and memory, from the development of programming languages, from the development of libraries to facilitate this programming, from the creation and development of standards for various interactions (protocols, formats), the Internet itself technologically and even textually - everything is built on this question.  And every programmer, from the most beginner and naive to the most (also beginner) but already ‚Äúmistaken‚Äù most of all - asks every day and works on this issue.  And about this endless debate, and about this holivary, and everything else. <br><br>  Let's leave philosophy aside and more to the point.  When creating a site, this question also arises.  Take a ready-made content management system (content) or write your own.  If you take, what?  And how expensive this choice will be.  If you do not take it, then how to be, and also - how ‚Äúexpensive‚Äù this choice will be worth. <br><br>  And now, just about WordPress.  WordPress allows you to make both choices together.  Of course, we will lose in something.  But choosing another, we will lose and "pay" more. <br><br>  See for yourself. <br><br>  WordPress - # 1 in the world for full meaning.  That is, WordPress "lies" most of the content on the Internet.  He is the most reliable now.  Choosing WordPress in any difficulty will help Google.  WordPress - the least will get in your way when you want to change something or even ‚Äúleave‚Äù it.  In general, WordPress is the lowest entry and exit cost for a developer today. <br><br>  WordPress - if you ‚Äúsell‚Äù websites - this is the perfect product.  It can be sold, calling "ready."  It can be sold, calling the "designer".  It can be sold, called "technology".  It can even be sold, calling hosting.  And it will not be a hoax.  By doing something to a client on WordPress, you never sell ‚Äúeverything‚Äù, you will always have something else to offer.  You will be in the eternal dialogue "I want - done - go to the cashier."  And if you do not want - ‚ÄúI want - we can not - but we know who can.‚Äù  WordPress is the most non-contentious, the most convincing, the most relaxed and the most interesting site you will be working on with your client.  Because it is understandable - both outside and inside. <br><br>  WordPress is in itself a large wholesale store of website development technology.  And this is fantastic.  Relatives of his coolness - probably only Linux, Bruce Willis and Chuck Norris.  On WordPress, you can "resell", "peredel" client thousands of plug-ins.  There is an endless repository!  On any idiotic "Wishlist" you can find two or three ready-made plug-ins.  Or ten.  But not less.  Confused to choose, in short.  This is a problem, yes.  But she decided. <br><br>  Further.  WordPress is a website you can forget about.  And this is the coolest.  Now, the stump is clear, it is already clear that the sites are becoming obsolete.  You can open any "abandoned" site and not even looking at the date below, next to "c copyright" to say when it was made. <br><br>  But not WordPress.  WordPress has been around for 10 years!  The first 10 years!  It will be modern for a long time.  You can ‚Äúabandon‚Äù the client, but WordPress won't.  It just needs to be updated, and again it is new, modern, cool, technologically advanced.  Well, like Linux.  Here it is already clear that I lied a little about Chuck and Bruce.  In short, WordPress taxis. <br><br>  I just want to tell you that I'm working with WordPress now and this is awesome, guys.  I'm just happy, I'm just in love!  All WordPress! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/197550/">https://habr.com/ru/post/197550/</a></p>
