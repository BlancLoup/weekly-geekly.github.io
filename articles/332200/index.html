  <section class="page js-page"><h1>VeeamON 2017: what marketers do not write in blogs</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  For the third time, a data access conference was held - <b>VeeamON</b> .  This year, it was visited by about 3,500 people, and all the action took place in the city of New Orleans, in Louisiana, which, in turn, is in the United States. <br><br>  Below will be a small report about what happened, so to speak, from the mouth of an ordinary engineer, who fell to participate in this event.  Of course, he, being a living person with a violent fantasy, tried in every way to see the maximum, spending the minimum. <br><br><h3>  What will not be here </h3><br>  Pereskazov announcements, press releases and stories about how we all heal in the near future, and the like.  To whom it is interesting - all marketing materials are extremely readily available, and I see them as a very dubious task to retell them.

    <h3>  What will be here? </h3><br>  Impressions of the city and thoughts, so to speak, "gypsy". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/0bb/8b3/ca8/0bb8b3ca8fe349c19d05d350a5398140.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  And why did you get there? </h3><br>  I work on the creation of training courses and certification of engineers.  And within the framework of the conference there were several events directly related to this. <br><br>  First, three days before the main event, our technical courses were read in several streams.  And immediately and in the usual, and on the advanced track, and to participate in this enrolled several hundred engineers.  And to me, as a creator, to see live, what questions people ask, to hear their impressions and simply communicate with the participants is important and interesting.  Yet live feedback from a large mass of people is an invaluable source of data for analysis. <br><br>  Then, when the main event started, my colleagues and I organized a Pearson Vue mobile certified test center, where anyone could get tested and get the appropriate certificates.  The bureaucracy is in its purest form, but only certified Pearson Vue people can do this. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/40b/3f1/31c/40b3f131c6de44e4947c221f8337ff02.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="99999">When almost everything is ready</font></i> <br><br>  And for dessert - Labwarz.  A game in which, using our products, you have to complete a number of tasks.  Who is the best, read - the fastest done, he received $ 10,000 and well done. <br><br><h3>  Getting there </h3><br>  To reach the scene of action was to be from St. Petersburg. <br><br>  Boldly forgetting the train / car options, a strategic decision was made to travel by plane.  After examining the options, we conclude that the journey will have to spend at least 20 hours and make two transplants.  As it turned out a little later thanks to less efficient colleagues, 20 hours is nothing, for some have known the joys of a 30-hour flight with sitting at the airport for 10 hours. <br><br>  Upon arrival, the sciatic nerve, with its shape, resembled the beloved wife's favorite frying pan, so the opportunity to walk with luggage before the taxi was perceived as a blessing on a universal scale. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/d4d/30c/735/d4d30c735c584eb089b9213f27005b9c.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="99999">Sleepy morning Novo-Orleanschina</font></i> <br><br>  About the taxi.  We are simple people, so uber was called, the order was instantly accepted, and we waited.  Five minutes later, we began to guess that something was not quite right, and it turned out that: in the world of victorious capitalism, you can only drive to the airport building just to the departure terminals.  In case of arrival, you can only drive into a special parking lot for those who meet you, where a special chaser for the Uber is allocated, where they are driven by a special person who does not allow them to stand there longer than 10 minutes.  And the cherry on the cake turned out that the colleague, who called for Uber, hammered his name in Russian, and the girl who accepted the order could not understand who to look for.  Well, roaming did not work for him, there was no local connection, and in general we are great. <br><br>  But, noticing a man who frantically ran between groups of arrivals, and could not resist natural curiosity, we asked what was happening and everything ended well - we finally went to the hotel. <br><br><h3>  Hotel </h3><br>  Since for me this is not the first trip to the States, I believe that I have every right to make a small summary of my observations. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/aa6/b38/7b4/aa6b387b4eb34a7e9dfe07ad7fe35330.JPG"><br>  <i><font color="99999">Night views from the height of the 16th floor</font></i> <br><br>  ¬∑ Room with breakfast included is something from the category of fiction.  The roots of this phenomenon are unknown, but the fact is a fact: 9 out of 10 hotels in the states do not include breakfast in the room rate, regardless of star rating.  Do you want to eat in the hotel in the morning - prepare the money. <br><br>  ¬∑ The average American number will always be greater than in Europe.  And the farther from the big city, the more it will be.  Minutes 10 on the highway away from the center, you can easily remove something from the kitchen, a huge hall and two bedrooms for the price of a single room.  The logic here is simple - the numbers should work.  No one want to rent a room as a family?  Then we surrender it to this strange comrade for the price of a single. <br><br>  ¬∑ Ah, and beds.  They are always infinitely huge and are lined with pillows in two layers.  What to do with so many pillows - a great mystery.  But my ninety-meter meter always turns out to be positioned at least along, at least across, at least as if without any problems.  And then also stretch your arms. <br><br><h3>  New Orleans City </h3><br>  We had a chance to live in the very center, which is called the French Quarter. <br>  A place of incredible color and originality.  This is confirmed by the Americans themselves, both local and from other cities, claiming that New Orleans is not like any other city in the United States and confidently keeps aloof. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/728/da0/62d/728da062dba34350b3b6e61aef5a73ab.JPG"><br>  <i><font color="99999">Typical views of the historic center</font></i> <br><br>  The city gives the impression of total carelessness, universal decency and victorious happiness.  This is indirectly confirmed by the city‚Äôs most popular nickname, The Big Easy.  New Orleans is known for its nightlife, carnival, clubs, alcohol, and in general "adulthood", because  You can find any 33 pleasures on almost every corner.  Sometimes you don‚Äôt even need to look for them - they come up and offer straight text. <br><br>  On the other hand, this city has the fantastic architecture of old buildings with amazing cast-iron balconies and beautiful historical areas.  All this is mixed in one place and creates a cocktail of impressions and emotions. <br><br>  Sorry, but the author decided not to stick his nose in poor areas because  locals recommend even on central streets at night especially not to relax if you walk alone.  And, frankly, beyond the boundaries of the historic neighborhoods, New Orleans is an extremely dull sight of a typical American city, so there‚Äôs nothing to do in the square. <br><br><h3>  Climate </h3><br>  I only had time to see the city, either instead of lunch or in the evening, instead of quiet sleep.  Therefore, I found only two types of local weather: the scorching heat of the sun during the day and the pleasant coolness of the evening, which due to the overall humidity of the air settles on your clothes with a sure layer of moisture. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/040/f1a/7f6/040f1a7f6d9f484382b71491c0be2c30.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="99999">We need more forged attic !!!</font></i> <br><br>  Attempting to go out in the afternoon in the sun in jeans in five minutes makes you feel all the pleasures of life of vampires.  Every thought, except the search for the shadow, is instantly burned by the merciless luminary. <br><br><h3>  Local </h3><br>  In this wonderful city it is necessary to send all survivors for the most diverse discrimination, because everyone will find for himself exactly what he is experiencing, or, on the contrary, actively scratch his chauvi or any other isism. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/4f5/1d2/d4d/4f51d2d4d25045a38e34371790db7613.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="99999">The first place for a souvenir, causing an unconscious desire to buy it</font></i> <br><br>  According to statistics, 60% of the population of the city - African Americans.  According to observations, all 80%.  In fact, if you go to any office building, it seems that the city consists of 90% white. <br><br>  The city is stratified as far as it can be imagined.  Recall all that you can, stereotypes and jokes about the racial composition of the United States, what they do, how they say, how they dress and how they should behave.  This is all there is here and splashes out right in your face with a dull attempt to portray tolerance through clenched teeth. <br><br>  But this does not mean that the first oncoming company of black guys will rob you and kill you, after which Asians will fly in and drag your corpse to organs for songs of Mexican mucacho.  No, everyone around is cute, relaxed, smiling and even honestly friendly, but, as I said in the beginning of the paragraph: one or two here you can find confirmation of absolutely any problems or advantages of modern society. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/c1d/e08/66e/c1de0866e4904d05b8251d4bff267902.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="99999">Typical American lineup</font></i> <br><br>  They also treat their personal space very respectfully, which is systematically dying out in big cities.  The American lineup is people standing at a distance of about a meter from each other.  Cuddle up to each other, carefully breathing in the back of the head in front of you - nobody will even come to mind so much.  The American traffic jam is when another one easily climbs between the cars, and the process of rebuilding between the rows enters the stupor of the unprepared Russian into the stupor.  No jerks, jumps and deft maneuvers.  Everything is so smooth and cumbersome that sometimes causes irritation. <br><br><h3>  Food </h3><br>  Traditionally, the States are fed for slaughter here, not forgetting to pour everything with a meter layer of soda with a kilogram of ice.  But here, New Orleans is out of the rut of the standard American city - the food here is really tasty.  Perhaps this is all due to the French roots and slaves from the plantations, but the local Creole cuisine is worthy to refuse to visit the network bigmachies. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/c7f/8fb/4a9/c7f8fb4a91f940b5a6e86bee80002fa7.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="99999">Few skyscrapers for contrast</font></i> <br><br>  The food is dominated by fish, beans and vegetables.  In general, the general thrust is this: the harder it is to understand what it is made of, the better.  The main local to try is called gumbo and jambalaya.  Gumbo is a very thick fish soup, which is more like our goulash than the soup, and jambalaya is a dish from the category "everything in the house should be thrown into a saucepan and stewed until ready." <br><br><h3>  Alcohol </h3><br>  With alcohol, the situation is interesting here. <br><br>  You can buy anything at any time of day.  And drink immediately from the store, because  open drinking is not prohibited here.  But on some streets you cannot walk with glass bottles, so in every pub and shop at the exit there is a healthy shelf with plastic cups, where you can pour just bought and calmly go further.  Amazing place. <br><br>  Now, about club places.  In all the bars, where we managed to visit, be it a jazz club, a regular disco or craft beer factory, the bar card looks like this: long so much, so many shots, so much beer.  And that's it!  It is amazingly convenient and incredibly helps to plan a budget. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/879/eb5/6c8/879eb56c8d6245c5bcaba69ecf6ccc28.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="99999">Learn to call the pubs correctly</font></i> <br><br>  By the way, with beer is even funnier.  The price tag for beer is divided into three parts.  The local is poor, local craft and the most expensive - it is always an overseas beer.  So in the menu and write.  And it is absolutely always a story about ‚Äúred caviar, black caviar, overseas caviar, eggplant‚Äù.  Do you want the Baltic "nine" that way for $ 8?  That way! <br><br>  In general, in institutions of beer here to drink is expensive pleasure.  Cocktails and shots are a much more reasonable investment, so go to them. <br><br>  The main local cocktail is the Hand Grenade, so named solely for the appearance of the container, which is the body of the American MK2, in which they attached the upper part of the bong.  The second most popular is Fish Bowl, which also does not represent anything interesting, except for tara.  As you might guess from the name, this is a plastic aquarium, where you get a liter or two, as much as you carry. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/ee7/790/27b/ee779027bae74ba0b9a63407ed3449e1.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="99999">Monuments to music functionaries right in the restaurant is the norm</font></i> <br><br>  And what I want to note - all local cocktails are complete rubbish!  Ice, incredible cloying syrup and a tiny drop of alcohol on top for smell.  Drinking this is absolutely impossible, although the locals use and even manage to hop. <br><br><h3>  Day life, cultural </h3><br>  I will say once again that for the eyes of New Orleans is beautiful!  The houses in the historic center are two- or three-storey buildings, with huge attic around the perimeter, wrought-iron grilles and permanently high windows.  The colonial bourgeoisie as it is. <br><br>  Next to them are the one-story Bracket Shotgun houses, where there are no attic rooms or grates, but there are extremely cute narrow windows with a minimum distance between them.  The main thing is to have large windows, which means that the light is inside, the attic with balconies, the incredible ingeniousness of the light grilles, and certainly several columns.  A house without columns is somehow not even serious.  And then again begin the elegant mansions, where everything is mixed up, from French to Italian and who knows what architecture. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/a4b/072/147/a4b0721472d5459da4a9ef05fa116fce.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="99999">Under each tree in the park will definitely sleep homeless</font></i> <br><br>  Right next to the main street of all Alkatreeps is Royal Street, the main shelter of art galleries and street musicians.  But a particularly high concentration of creative personalities is located in Jackson Square and the beautiful St. Louis Basilica. <br><br>  There you can rent a horse-drawn carriage and roll it beautifully through the streets.  And when you want to raise the entourage to a new level, you have to go to the Mississippi Embankment and get on an authentic three-storyed wheelboat and under the measured noise of its mechanisms (by the way, you can go to the engine room) to pose as a planter for two hours.  They say that Mark Twain‚Äôs books are especially good at these walks, because  he wrote them on such steamers.  But, to be honest, there is nothing special to look at these walks - an industrial landscape inside and out.  Although if you like the look of a rusty tank farm, the ship is the first place to go. <br><br><h3>  Evening life - clubs and bars </h3><br>  Even if you are an insolent sober-headed and evening with a book for you the best of all the blessings of the world, you just have to walk along the main club street of Bourbon Street in the evening if only to soak up its atmosphere and feel the city. <br><br>  Unlike the institutions we are used to, live music will play in 90% of the places, and there is a very clear division in musical styles, and you can find them for every taste and color.  But reigns here, of course, jazz.  Jazz is here and everywhere. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/e25/5af/762/e255af76283c448a913ebd27106ffba2.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="99999">If there is no live music in the bar, it means that you are doing something completely wrong.</font></i> <br><br>  But there is no problem finding a traditional disco or a rock house here.  Indeed, for any color and taste: wherever you go, there will be a striptease next to, a geeklub opposite, and in the middle of the street there will be a colorful madam offering her divination services on tarot, and she surely knows where the real voodoo shop is located not these tourist fakes. <br><br>  And this whole farce is sparkling and spinning from about noon till the morning. <br><br><h3>  the Internet </h3><br>  If you have heard somewhere that the States are very bad with the Internet, and Wi-Fi is rare, then forget this nonsense!  To find a place in the center of the city, where there is no open grid, it is necessary to try very hard.  Moreover, this is not done at all like ours, when we need to go inside and ask for the password.  No, the networks here are open or with minimal authorization, consisting of one tick. <br><br><h3>  Instead of conclusion </h3><br>  Meanwhile, the conference went on as usual, and we were in this car just in small gears.  New products and solutions were presented, partners were announced, and agreements were agreed.  All this can be read in numerous marketing reports. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/220/3c3/278/2203c3278d1f4884b84dacda1306a853.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="99999">Jazz is everywhere</font></i> <br><br>  As for my part, quite a few pages were written in notes, a lot of conclusions were made, and the seeds of new ideas were thrown into fertile soil. <br><br>  I noted to myself that people treat trainings at conferences as another type of entertainment activity, even though it‚Äôs far from being free to attend.  The result confirming this conclusion was predictable and sad for someone - a few engineers were able to pass the certification test. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/d22/ebf/ffe/d22ebfffe6d64c38904cb3640a82782e.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="99999">When it's over and it's time to leave.</font></i> <br><br>  As for the city itself.  Does it make sense to go to New Orleans across the entire planet on purpose and for your money?  Definitely not. <br><br>  But if you happen to be in the States on occasion \ with an opportunity, then spending a day or two to visit is the very thing. <br><br>  <b>Link at the end.</b>  <b>As without them</b> <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://www.veeam.com/university.html">Veeam University It is</a> fascinating and free to explain why you absolutely cannot live without our software and how to use this disgrace properly. </li><li>  <a href="https://www.veeam.com/vmce.html">Our certifications</a> , which pass far not everyone can. </li><li>  <a href="https://www.veeamon.com/">The site of the whole exhibition</a> , where you can still find marketing materials </li><li>  <a href="https://www.veeam.com/veeamon/free-sessions">Top five reports</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/332200/">https://habr.com/ru/post/332200/</a></p>
