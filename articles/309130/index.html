The formation of this model began before my arrival, it develops with the company and will be improved further. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I must emphasize that these theses are not introduced by the order of the enterprise, they just try to follow them, which allows us to look at things the same way and speak the same language.  These rules are not mandatory, but following them greatly simplifies our work, makes it more expected and predictable, minimizes the possibility of an error and / or annoying oversight with respect to each other. <br><br>  Our corporate standard prescribes the use of Microsoft Outlook, examples and mechanisms are described for this tool, but I admit that for your email client, calendar, you can find opportunities to implement such scenarios.

    <h3>  Email </h3><br>  <b>1.</b> Mail must be checked and responded to it at least 3 times a day: in the morning (upon arrival at work), in the daytime (before lunch), in the evening (one hour before the end of work).  More frequent reactions to emails are welcomed and approved. <br><br>  <b>2.</b> If for any reason it is not possible (vacation, business trip, illness), then it is necessary to put an auto-answer with the persons replacing you in various directions and the date before which to send auto-answers.  If necessary, it is permissible to indicate the contact of your immediate supervisor and the request to send you a copy of further correspondence. <br><br>  <b>3.</b> Having received an e-mail, in case the sender has requested confirmation of the reading, it must be sent.  As a rule, this tool is used when the content of the letter is of particular importance for the sender.  However, you should not devalue the concept of ‚ÄúConfirmations of reading‚Äù; in the default settings, you should not automatically request confirmation for all your outgoing emails. <br><br>  <b>4.</b> If the letter contains an instruction / request and does not indicate the date of execution, in the reply to the letter, indicate the approximate or exact deadline by which you can fulfill this.  If the order does not fit into your current work schedule, then briefly describe the current situation and possible deadlines.  If necessary, discuss the task and priorities with your immediate supervisor. <br><br>  <b>5. The</b> new order does not cancel other works, unless explicitly stated. <br><br>  <b>6.</b> If by the deadline (especially in the case when you yourself indicated it) you do not have time to work out the order at the agreed time, you must, on your own initiative, as soon as you have such suspicions, inform the person who assigned you the task.  It is necessary to clarify the reasons for non-compliance, agree on a new date or change priorities for current work.  If the assignment is completed before the scheduled time - inform the supervisor or the person who entrusted you with the task.  This will reduce the waiting time for others or provide an opportunity to expand the time frame for the implementation of their stages. <br><br>  <b>7.</b> For an additional reminder of the need for a reply, the sender can conveniently use the ‚ÄúAdd a reminder‚Äù function.  In the appropriate fields can be configured in the form of pop-up windows as reminders for recipients and for the sender.  Reminders help us remember to give an answer, are used as an additional external irritant. <br><br>  <b>8.</b> If your address is listed in the Cc: field, the sender wants you to be aware of the discussion.  If you have any suggestions / additions / questions on the merits of the correspondence, you need to write about them to all the participants of the correspondence by selecting the "Answer all" button.  Your suggestions may be consonant with the opinions of other recipients of the letter and you will save time for the rest. <br><br>  <b>9.</b> If you receive a letter and your address is not in the recipients, the sender decided to put your address in the ‚ÄúBcc‚Äù field.  The sender wants you to be in the know, but the one to whom the letter is addressed does not want it to be known.  In this case, it is preferable to conduct correspondence only with the sender, and not to write in the "Reply to all" mode.  An alternative would be to forward a letter from those sent to the ‚Äúsecret‚Äù reader. <br><br>  <b>10.</b> The ‚ÄúSubject:‚Äù field should not be left blank.  It briefly indicates the essence of the correspondence.  In the future, it helps to search and sort messages. <br><br>  <b>11.</b> Do not change the "Subject:" field when replying and forwarding.  This makes it impossible to automatically group letters in M ‚Äã‚Äã$ Outlook in the form of conversations.  Please note that some email clients on mobile devices add and add characters: ‚Äú&gt;&gt;‚Äù, ‚ÄúRe:‚Äù, ‚ÄúFw:‚Äù, ‚ÄúTo:‚Äù, ‚ÄúFrom:‚Äù and some others to the ‚ÄúSubject:‚Äù field. .  When setting up the program, make sure that the display of conversations is not ‚Äútorn‚Äù on a PC in M ‚Äã‚Äã$ Outlook when you reply and forward it. <br><br>  <b>12.</b> If the sender did not receive a response letter from you within three days (or another term is not specified in the text), this is considered your agreement with the content of the letter, its attachments and links to other resources and information. <br><br><h3>  Appointment of meetings, meetings, meetings </h3><br>  <b>1.</b> Using the M $ Outlook calendar is an indispensable tool for coordinating the joint activities of employees in a company. <br><br>  <b>2.</b> When you receive a meeting request, in addition to clicking the Accept button, you must send a receipt notification (if it is not configured to automatically send M $ Outlook to your client). <br><br>  <b>3.</b> It is necessary to get acquainted with the materials for the meeting in advance; it is necessary to come to the meeting prepared on the topic of discussion.  The rule of good taste for the organizer is the placement of protocols, proposals in a letter of invitation to the meeting (file or a link to external resources).  If you have questions on the topic, content, they should be discussed in advance with the person who sent the invitation to the meeting or the employee from whom you can get an answer.  A question to the organizer at the meeting: ‚ÄúI just wanted to ask you ...‚Äù is the least relevant. <br><br>  <b>4.</b> All appointments with tight deadlines should be reflected in your personal M $ Outlook calendar.  This will allow other employees of the company when taking appointments to take into account your employment, to use the Planning Assistant more effectively. <br><br>  <b>5.</b> When setting up meetings within the company, it is imperative to use the planning assistant tool.  This will allow you to choose the most appropriate time for all participants. <br><br>  <b>6.</b> When making an appointment, be sure to set a reminder for the start of the meeting.  When receiving a meeting and confirming participation, be sure to check this date and, if necessary, adjust it in your calendar taking into account the necessary transport accessibility to the venue of the event.  Typically, the default setting is 30 minutes, but this time can be changed in the settings of your M $ Outlook. <br><br>  <b>7.</b> When adjusting the deadlines or canceling periodic meetings, do not delete them!  It is preferable to change the deadline of the ‚Äúold‚Äù meeting and form a new recurring meeting for the future.  This will leave a trace in the history of past events in your calendar and calendars of your colleagues, especially since invitations may contain additional materials for meetings, minutes, etc. <br><br>  <b>8.</b> When setting up an additional meeting on a similar issue, one should not postpone the meeting, it is preferable to create a copy, although this is more laborious.  This will save your ‚Äúmemory‚Äù both in your calendar and in other meeting participants.  Often, when copying (duplicating) a meeting, the reminder time at the recipients is reset.  Pay attention to this before sending the invitation!  However, if you follow rule 6, the recipients will fix it. <br><br>  <b>9.</b> If you have received an invitation to a meeting, but for one reason or another you cannot take part in it, you must inform the organizer and delegate the visit to your colleagues or inform your immediate supervisor and act on his instructions.  In case of receipt of a proposal for a meeting for the already scheduled time, it is necessary to weigh your capabilities, the tasks and priorities facing you, to decide on participation in the event.  If necessary, delegating to colleagues / subordinates, to consult with the organizer or immediate supervisor and act on his instructions. <br><br>  I am almost sure that many people, especially those who support creative work, consider these requirements redundant, but it is important for us to clearly understand how an employee of the company will act in the described situations, what to expect from colleagues. <br><br>  I admit that our ideas will seem interesting, they will help you personally or your company to improve the effectiveness of IT communications, or you will have suggestions for adding / changing this article. <br><br>  Dialogue of participants is welcomed! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/309130/">https://habr.com/ru/post/309130/</a></p>
