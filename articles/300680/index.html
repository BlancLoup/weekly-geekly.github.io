      <b>1 / Telephone interview begins 15 minutes before or after the appointed time - or never at all</b> <br>  What for?  To find a person who is always ready to start working.  Everyone can cope with the questions of the recruiter, if the call occurs exactly at the appointed time.  And if you call a candidate when he sleeps, runs a marathon or sits in the toilet?  How a person responds to an unexpected call will help an IT company select an employee who will be ready to work at any time. <br><br>  <b>2 / The interview plan should be as confusing and unpredictable as possible.</b> <br>  What for?  To find an employee who can do without precise instructions.  When neither the candidate nor the interviewer himself knows exactly what will happen during the interview, one can observe how the person manifests himself in an incomprehensible situation. <br><br>  <b>Well, if you drop everything.</b>  <b>Seriously.</b>  <b><a href="http://icanchoose.ru/blog/pochemu-stoit-nachinat-kareru-so-stazhirovki/">How to try it for the first time?</a></b>  <b>We told <a href="http://icanchoose.ru/blog/pochemu-stoit-nachinat-kareru-so-stazhirovki/">about it here.</a></b>  <b>There is also a great opportunity to have information.</b> <br><br>  <b>3 / Something must go wrong during the presentation</b> <br>  What for?  To see how the candidate adapts to the new non-ideal conditions.  The interview is specifically conducted where something from the technology but does not work.  If a person calmly responded to a small scenario change and was able to adapt to new circumstances, then it will be easy to work with him.  Benefits will be given to those who have a plan B, C or even G - this quality will be of great use in the field of IT. <br><br>  <b>4 / The recruiter will constantly twist the facts of your biography</b> <br>  What for?  To weed out especially irritable.  If a candidate has previously worked on Twitter, they will definitely ask him: ‚ÄúHow long have you worked at Yahoo !?‚Äù The recruiter will pay special attention to the intonation with which he will be corrected.  Thus, it will be clear how a potential employee will behave if something goes awry. <br><br>  <b>5 / The recruiter will ask you to solve the problem that the company recently faced.</b> <br>  What for?  Because they really need.  IT companies often offer candidates to solve one of the tasks they are currently working on.  Free help never hurts. <br><br>  <b>6 / The interviewer and the candidate will change the place of the conversation several times.</b> <br>  What for?  To find a person who does not extinguish the fire in the eyes due to slight inconvenience.  And also one who understands that not a single meeting room is free all day. <br><br>  <b>7 / They will ask the same questions again and again</b> <br>  What for?  To check how the candidate is consistent. <br>  In the IT world, predictability is appreciated.  The recruiter will pretend that he did not understand or has forgotten your answer, and will re-ask you some question in order to assess how consistent and logical you are. <br><br>  <b>8 / The interview will take place in the format of "bad and good cop"</b> <br>  What for?  To find someone who will be able to multitask in stressful situations. <br>  The candidate will be asked to sit in the middle of the table between the two interviewers.  Will the candidate be able to give the same amount of attention to both interlocutors?  Or does he quickly run out of gas and only thinks about the devil he forgot here?  This will help to know how the candidate will behave in the case of trawling. <br><br>  <b>9 / Very.</b>  <b>Loud.</b>  <b>Print.</b> <br>  What for?  To find someone who can concentrate in spite of the annoying knocking of keys - or any other noise that distracts attention. <br>  The candidate will be asked a question, and as soon as he begins to answer, the interviewer will start typing very loudly.  He will apologize and say that he is writing down the answer.  Is the person going to stand up or will he continue to speak as if nothing had happened? <br><br>  <b>Scared already?</b>  <b>:) <a href="http://icanchoose.ru/blog/pochemu-stoit-nachinat-kareru-so-stazhirovki/">Have you thought about going through an internship?</a></b> <br><br>  <b>10/3 months later they will call to offer you the wrong position for which you were interviewing.</b> <br>  What for?  To find someone who really wants to work with them.  This is a great way to weed out candidates who do not really want to get this job.  Will the candidate fight for the position that he originally hoped to take?  Or will he accept the offer, because he believes that he will not achieve more anyway?  Or will he refuse because he has already found another job?  This technique will help to find out for sure. <br><br>  There is a bit of irony in this, but some people have actually come across such checks in Amazon and Square. <br><br>  And how did they check you? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/300680/">https://habr.com/ru/post/300680/</a></p>
