  <section class="page js-page"><h1>20 steps towards a popular community</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Communities are very popular in the blogosphere.  Even more popular is the creation of communities.  Only now it is far from a fact that a huge mass of people will necessarily appear in the community created by you (and you really want it, don't you?).  What is the problem?  Why do you create an "attractive community", but people do not appear in it?  This is what I decided to try to figure out. <br><br>  Initially, the idea was in the "debriefing" of one community ("fragrant community"), to use its example to sort through the process of creating and promoting a community in the blogosphere.  He wrote one and a half pages of "debriefing" and realized that further - laziness. <br><br>  I realized that the most indigestible option for me now is to present thoughts in the form of 20 (or more - as it will) steps along the way of creating and developing your own community.

    <a name="habracut"></a>  <b>1. The name should be simple and clear.</b> <br><br>  Good - "Flavors and smells", bad - "Fragrant community."  In the first case, the user enters the community without thinking, in the second, it is most likely to flip through our community. <br><br>  <b>2. The description in the profile should be made with humor, a pun is useful.</b> <br><br>  Try to abandon the gray "Community of lovers of smells", let it be better to be trite "From the fragrant rose to the armpits of fragrant - we are talking about all the flavors." <br><br>  <b>3. In the interest, it is desirable to specify the maximum possible number of keywords (community bloggers will find them).</b> <br><br>  To set the maximum possible coverage of potential users of the blogosphere, we use the synonym dictionary and English-Russian.  From the first we take all possible synonyms and add ‚Äúinterests‚Äù to the section, from the second - translations of key interests. <br><br>  <b>4. Picture-avatar should not be banal, it should be an element of mystery.</b> <br><br>  An excellent example of a great logo for the community was the idea (by <a href="http://mrfilin.livejournal.com/">mrfilin</a> ) to take soap from the ‚Äúfight club‚Äù and write soap operas on it (for the TV series community). <br><br>  <b>5. Before the next stage - the promotion should fill the community with interesting content.</b>  <b>10-20 posts will be enough.</b>  <b>These could be articles on your community, questions, tests, and more.</b>  <b>The main thing is that they should be interesting and useful.</b> <br><br>  Try not only to take other people's posts, articles and other materials, but also create your own.  Dilute the materials used with your questions, thoughts, advice. <br><br>  <b>6. Enter the community in the thematic catalog of Yandex.</b> <br><br>  <a href="">http://blogs.yandex.ru/add-catalogue.xml</a> <br><br>  <b>7. Create a tag system, on the basis of which select several sections of the community.</b>  <b>In the future, it will help to move around the community in order not to repeat itself and find what you are looking for.</b> <br><br>  First, let's assume 4 sections.  Reflect the presence of a section in the profile and design of the magazine. <br><br>  <b>8. Ask your friends to join the community.</b>  <b>To begin with, it would not be bad if a dozen other participants in the community were consisted.</b> <br><br>  When you enter an empty community, the first desire is to quickly find a more active place to communicate. <br><br>  <b>9. Find communities whose topics will be related to yours.</b>  <b>Become an active member of these communities - write posts, comment.</b> <br><br>  Just communicate, meet people, earn trust. <br><br>  <b>10. Do not begin to participate in the new community by advertising your community.</b> <br><br>  Earn trust with your knowledge, your participation, and not the ability to write advertising. <br><br>  <b>11. In those communities and blogs where you already know who you commented on, you can start mentioning the community little by little.</b> <br><br>  Have you seen a question or topic that is somehow related to your community?  Perhaps there is an answer to your question in your community?  Perhaps in your community the subject reveals in more details?  Fine.  Give a quote and further - a link to the community. <br><br>  <b>12. When there are at least a hundred people in the community, it would not be bad to hold a competition.</b> <br><br>  The competition will help develop the popularity of your community.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe competition should be connected with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe community, but it is worth considering the trends.  For the community about smells, a contest for ‚Äúthe most fragrant photo‚Äù would fit. <br><br>  <b>13. Or post information that can make your community popular using the ‚Äúvirus‚Äù method.</b> <br><br>  This kind of post is generally worth writing regularly.  It can be all sorts of collections of something better, funny, entertaining.  Think what exactly the members of your community might like so much that they will reprint it. <br><br>  <b>14. Regularly maintain community activity (1-2) fasting per day, no less.</b> <br><br>  Search queries on blogs above give exactly this post and the community that were last published. <br><br>  <b>15. Do not forget to inform the community about new friends.</b> <br><br>  Surely they may just join or even be interested in your community.  As you know - ‚Äúmore people - more communication‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>16. Make sure that no spam appears in the community, interesting posts appear regularly, and discussions take place regularly.</b> <br><br>  As a community creator, first of all you yourself should be interested in minimizing repulsive content, conflicts, and everything else that can alienate the blogger community. <br><br>  <b>17. Never forget that fame and popularity do not come all at once.</b>  <b>Creating, developing and promoting a community is work.</b>  <b>And refers to this need applies to how to work.</b>  <b>Otherwise, forget about the desired popularity.</b> <br><br>  In order for the community to become popular, you need to put a lot of effort into it, unless of course you have one or two dozen friends in your friends, who are happy to tell about your community for beautiful denyuzhku eyes. <br><br>  <b>18. Expanding the circle of dating over time, you can directly ask your friends to tell about your community in your blog.</b> <br><br>  Believe me, such seeming arrogance would be allowed if you reciprocate and help those who helped you once in such ‚Äútrifles‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>19. The basic principles of existence in social media are respect and honesty, trust and openness.</b>  <b>Do not forget about it.</b> <br><br>  Without respect, you will not become popular, deceiving, once you find yourself revealed, without trust you will not receive attention, staying closed will not see the world. <br><br>  <b>20. It is important not the number of links - it is important the number of friends.</b> <br><br>  You can put in a thousand links and there will be ten people in your community.  And you can put 5 and it will be a hundred people.  If they don't know you, they won't find out about the community. <br><br>  <a href="http://semyonov-alex.livejournal.com/2557.html">from my journal semyonov_alex</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/51205/">https://habr.com/ru/post/51205/</a></p>
