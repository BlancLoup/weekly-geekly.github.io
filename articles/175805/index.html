      <b>Or do all these resources also secretly advertise me?</b>  <b>:)</b> <br><br>  In this article I want to tell habrazhiteli about headphones Monoprice 9927 (MEP-933) and their brethren.  In our country (both in Ukraine and in Russia) only professional musicians, and only a few, know about Monoprice.  And in the US and Europe, this brand is quite popular for its audio cables, various video converters, adapters, network equipment and other things.  Monoprice's popularity lies in the high quality of its products at ‚Äúnon-brand‚Äù prices.  And for no small part of this popularity, Monoprice is required to own-produced headphones. <br>  Let me immediately dot the i's - these headphones in the US cost about $ 10 with delivery, in Europe about $ 15, and we have about $ 17.  They are not perfect, there are flaws in the design and in the sound too, but they will put many headphones on the blades, which are 2-3 times more expensive.  Therefore, owners of reinforcing headphones, headphones with a price tag of over $ 50-60, I urge you not to write something like ‚Äúmy AKG K340 still sounds better‚Äù. <br><br><h1>  A little background </h1><br>  I, probably, after the breakdown of regular headphones on my first player, looking for headphones that will not disappoint me.  I had the usual Chinese from the market, A4Tech, Koss and the last -Sennheiser MX170, which I was pleased with.  Yes, this is all budget level.  I just did not have the opportunity to spend on headphones more than $ 15 - as they say, to each his own. <br>  So, when my Sennheiser MX170 began to lose one ear, I began to use the Internet for reviews and reviews of inexpensive headphones.  I had several options, but it turned out that we have very little headphones for a budget level with decent sound quality.  But one of the options - Monoprice 8320 (MEP-933) - I found in Ukraine.  Honestly, most of all I was embarrassed by the color ‚Äúchrome‚Äù in them, but I was lucky, and it turned out that quite recently the monoprice began to produce them in black, though they have different markings - Monoprice 9927 (MEP-933).  In addition, the equipment has changed from the one described in the reviews, and served as a minus - they were previously supplied in ordinary plastic bags.  And nothing else, headphones and a bag :).  To me, the headphones have already come in a box and, what is the most important advantage - the bundle included 2 pairs of additional ear cushions (in common ‚Äúrubber bands‚Äù) of different sizes.  Thank God, manufacturers read reviews and take action. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/74c/70d/4a8/74c70d4a899de414abb5da199eed81ee.jpg"><br><h1>  Getting down to business </h1><br>  Headphones, of course, unusually large.  This is due to the fact that they have a large 14.2 mm speaker.  Apparently, I had to sacrifice design for the sake of sound.  The material of the ‚Äúears‚Äù itself is of high quality, something like rubberized plastic, on top there is a metal plate with bolts (which, it seems to me, are unscrewed).  The cord in the fabric winding is quite practical and reliable.  In the pocket of the headphones are confused, but not critical.  By the way, here's a video with fun music and instructions on how to twist the wire so that it does not get tangled. <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/QJKE7m-KEQY%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500004,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700258&amp;usg=ALkJrhj9rEkgmwUAJxMZS6UFQ6qtZoxSag" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Headphones sit a little non-standard - the wire should be lowered in front (or you can pass it around the ear).  Many blame the headphones for the lack of sound insulation due to the design, but it helped me to change the ear cushions for larger ones.  Connector straight, gold plated. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e3f/a67/9b7/e3fa679b780a569f7b9b7a71f9a7ecd5.jpg"><br>  The most important thing is sound.  I don't have cool Ipods or Cowons, I listened on the usual android smart on the PowerAmp player.  The first <s>thing that caught my eye</s> that I heard was a deep and high-quality sound.  I heard in my tracks what I did not hear in old headphones. <br>  Let's go through the frequencies. <br><br><h2>  Low frequencies. </h2><br>  Very wide and deep bass.  With standard ear cushions, I missed it a bit, the big ones got better.  For fans of Drum &amp; Bass, it seems to me, too.  The bass does not rip, does not merge into one ‚Äúbububu‚Äù. <br><br><h2>  Mids. </h2><br>  Probably the average is the strongest side of these headphones.  You simply will not find such a sound in this price range.  The sound is very detailed, clear.  The vocals are simply matchless.  I have not heard this before.  When I received them, I sat and turned over my playlist the whole evening in order to ‚Äúlisten to more, and more, and that song also needs to be included‚Äù. <br><br><h2>  High frequencies. </h2><br>  Everything is audible well, nothing sands and merges into one.  The only drawback I would point to is a bit high-pitched sound at high volume on tracks like Dj Tiesto - She Wolf.  As for me, the composition itself is quite high, and very fast.  True, on my old headphones they are not heard at all :). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bb3/1d6/215/bb31d6215d74e55acbe8ec0da1a92a65.jpg"><br><h1>  Warming up </h1><br>  For me, warming up earlier was something mythical.  As for the warm-up, that after nothing has changed.  After reading the Internet tips, I warmed them.  IsoTek - Full System Enhancer &amp; Rejuvenation Disc can be downloaded from the Internet.  Also, on the Internet you can read the whole FAQ how to do it correctly. <br>  After warming up, I noticed that the tall ones became better, more detailed.  The rest of the sound became more open, the bass became more balanced. <br><br><h1>  Dry residue </h1><br>  I believe that these are the best headphones that you can buy up to $ 20.  Sennheiser, Koss, in this price category, lose at the start.  Some put them next to the Sennheiser CX300 and their siblings, but as for me, the monoprice is more balanced. <br><br><h2>  Minuses </h2><br>  - not all suitable design <br>  - large size of the headphones themselves <br>  - the wire gets tangled <br><br><h2>  pros </h2><br>  - price <br>  - 3 different types of nozzles <br>  - very high quality and balanced sound. <br><br>  <i>My second mistake is the characteristics.</i>  <i>Protupil, I agree :)</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Type of headphones earplugs</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Frequency range 20Hz-20kHz</i> <i><br></i>  <i>32 ohm impedance</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Sensitivity 96 ¬± 3 dB</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Straight plug shape</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Speaker 14.2 mm</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Length 122.5 cm</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/175805/">https://habr.com/ru/post/175805/</a></p>
