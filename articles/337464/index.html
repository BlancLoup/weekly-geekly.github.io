After all, every employer is interested in building a "best team", and this is the main task of the recruitment specialists - to find the same candidate.

      At the same time, we continue to meet people who are wary of calls to HR specialists, and in general are not ready to engage in dialogue with recruiting companies: someone because of his skeptical attitude, someone is lazy or thinks that this is wasted time.  And this article we want to show that we "do not bite" and can really be useful. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Telephone conversation (first contact)</b> <br><br>  We are well aware that there are times when it is not convenient for you to talk on the phone, so we are ready to offer various options: social and professional networks, various instant messengers, email, skype, after all, we can arrange for a call at a convenient time.  Do not give up the opportunity to get acquainted with various vacancies, because often we can offer you 2-5 vacancies from different industries at the same time.  And yes, the search can be confidential, and only we can know about this position) <br><br>  <b>Interview with a consultant</b> <br><br>  Every day in our work, we hear the question: ‚ÄúWhy should I come to you for an interview, you will not tell me anything, you will not check technical skills.  No, I only communicate directly with the manager. ‚Äù  But the reality is that managers simply do not have so much time, and they really need a filter in the person of an internal or external recruiter, because companies often have critical requirements, but not related to the candidate‚Äôs technical experience.  Yes, we will not tell you about the deep technical nuances of the work;  Yes, we will not be able to say how perfect the code you have presented (although I assure you, there are IT recruiters who are slowly starting to code)), but we will be able to give an opportunity to get acquainted with what is on the market now and share our expertise on what companies may be interested in your experience. <br><br>  <b>How is the interview?</b> <br><br>  We are mobile, we are ready to meet not only in person, but also to communicate on Skype.  Little time?  No question, on average, Skype interview takes 30 minutes. <br><br>  All the questions we ask are aimed at understanding your motivation, interests, expertise.  Why do we need this?  We are not conducting an interrogation, we are conducting a dialogue with you, which leads us to a common denominator.  We better understand what is important to you as a future employer, we understand what priorities you set for yourself, what you strive for and what you want to achieve in a professional way.  All this helps us to find an offer that is really interesting for you. <br><br>  It is important that we can tell you about the employer a little more than he can tell about himself) Passwords and turnout, so to speak.  But seriously, we are ready to provide information on the following points - how is the interview going, what questions are asked, what should be ready for. <br><br>  Recall once again about confidential positions, you can learn a little more about the market than there is in open sources. <br><br>  Believe me, it is important for us not only to close the vacancy, it is important for us that both the candidate and the client are satisfied with their choice for many years.  And even if we do not work out the first time (the dialogue on the first position discussed does not lead to employment), you will be provided with vacancies for a long time to come) We have many cases in which we successfully arranged people to work some time after our primary communicate with them.  The market is growing and developing, and IT specialists are always needed. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/337464/">https://habr.com/ru/post/337464/</a></p>
