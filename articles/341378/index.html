Our speakers include leading industry experts from Russia, Europe and the USA.  The main topics of the conference are platform operation insides (CLR, GC, JIT), best practices in the use of tools, profiling and performance optimization, multi-threaded programming, platform innovations, solving complex cases. </p><br><p>  Under the cut - a detailed analysis of the program, a few words about the innovations of this year and the <strong>secret promotional code</strong> with a discount. </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1 id="vozvraschenie-hardkora">  The return of hardcore </h1><br><p>  <strong>First</strong> , the changes affected the composition of the reports. </p><br><p>  Past DotNext in St. Petersburg was held at an amazing time - many new technologies came out or were being prepared for release.  Almost all the reports were about this, which automatically meant a reduction in the complexity of the material.  The survey showed that people were not particularly interested in ideas like digging in the insides of GC and repairing collapsing profilers (javista's favorite activities), but they were very interested in how to implement Docker and Kubernetes into a ready-made .NET infrastructure.  It was just such a time. </p><br><p>  On DotNext 2017 Moscow <strong>hardcore comes back</strong> .  We are still not going to delve into the GC - but we are going to discuss the memory model, performance testing and optimization, debugging subtleties, and even debugging on Linux.  For special connoisseurs, there are two reports on the use of functional programming.  Now hardcore reports - exactly one third of the total. </p><br><p>  However, the discussion of "normal" issues and tools has not gone away.  There is a large block of reports on cluster and cloud infrastructure, there is a discussion of the bodies and methods of their use (such as code generation practice), there is something about devops and security, and so on.  Everyone will find a theme to their liking. </p><br><p>  Obviously, this amount of information will not fit on one day, so now DotNext takes two days and three parallel tracks.  Opening takes place at 10 am (on the first day, check-in is at 9 am), closing - at 7 pm, i.e.  9 hours per track.  In order not to melt the brain from such a volume, you can plan to visit not only the most complex reports, but dilute them with more light ones.  But how to get on everything that is planned - this will be written below. </p><br><h1 id="vkalyvayut-roboty-a-ne-chelovek">  Robots are crammed, not human </h1><br><p>  <strong>Secondly</strong> , we hooked up heavy artillery and analyzed the distribution of reports by track using special samopisny software.  We solve the following problem: suppose a person wanted to go to 3 previously known reports.  How to make them happen at different times so that they don‚Äôt have to choose between them? </p><br><p>  The basis is <a href="http://www.optaplanner.org/">OptaPlanner</a> - a universal solver of business constraints.  It is specially created for solving tasks such as routing cars, distributing employees by tasks, optimizing cloud computing, packaging goods and so on.  All these tasks are united by the fact that they are similar to solving a puzzle in which it is necessary to redistribute limited resources to their respective consumers.  Approximately the same problem arises when planning the distribution of reports. </p><br><p>  On top of OptaPlanner was written its own engine called <a href="https://github.com/vlsi/confplanner">ConfPlanner</a> .  In particular, for this you need to thank <a href="https://jokerconf.com/">Vladimir Sitnikov</a> .  Vladimir is a performance architect at NetCracker and a member of the program committees of the JUG.ru Group.  The result is an open project, the source of which can be <a href="https://github.com/vlsi/confplanner">on the githabe</a> . </p><br><p>  The bottom line is that we set the constraints in the form of a YAML file and at the output we get a ready-made solution. </p><br><pre><code class="hljs pgsql">capacity: <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">400</span></span> languages: -

Those surveys where you indicate what reports are going to go. </p><br><p>  For example, a person wants to go on 3 reports and it so happens that they are lined up "in one line" (coincide in time).  This combination is valid, but penalty points are awarded for it.  The essence of the solution to the problem of drawing up the optimal report schedule is minimization of the penalty function. </p><br><p>  Of course, after ConfPlanner made comments, the schedule is well thought out by real people.  As you can see, <strong>filling out surveys is useful</strong> .  Your opinion is really taken into account, in the most direct sense. </p><br><h2 id="obeschannyy-sekretnyy-promokod">  Promised Secret Promocode </h2><br><p>  At first, I wanted to insert a promotional code somewhere in the final part of the article, or in the middle of the list of reports, so that I had to search for it a little.  It quickly became clear that the number of reports was large enough that no one could find it.  So here, keep the code: </p><br><blockquote>  LastCallPromo </blockquote><p>  Using this code on <a href="https://dotnext-moscow.ru/tickets/">the registration page</a> , you can get a discount before the end of the week. </p><br><h1 id="soderzhanie-programmy">  Content of the program </h1><br><p>  Now let's go through the reports and see what this conference will be about.  Conventionally, all reports can be divided into the following groups: </p><br><ul><li>  Performance and low-level details <br><ul><li>  Network code </li><li>  Debugging </li></ul></li><li>  Clusters and clouds <br><ul><li>  Transportation systems </li></ul></li><li>  Language, tools and programming techniques <br><ul><li>  Functional programming </li></ul></li><li>  miscellanea <br><ul><li>  Machine learning and materiel </li><li>  Security </li><li>  Monitoring, Operation and DevOps </li><li>  Philosophy (!) </li></ul></li></ul><br><p>  It is important to note that this division is conditional.  The reports themselves are not tied to any rigid classification.  It would be possible to group them in some other way, for example, by the framework used.  However, the above structure has an excellent property: it helps to choose which report to go to. </p><br><h1 id="perfomans-i-nizkourovnevye-podrobnosti">  Performance and low-level details </h1><br><h2 id="keynout-pogovorim-pro-performance-testirovaniehttpsdotnext-moscowru2017msktalks6a4afxs2sqmwws0yuoc06s">  Keynout: <a href="https://dotnext-moscow.ru/2017/msk/talks/6a4afxs2sqmwws0yuoc06s/">Let's talk about performance testing</a> </h2><br><p>  <em>Andrey Akinshin, JetBrains</em> </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/we/jc/lt/wejclt_egp0bc_g-hv8lhrdwalw.jpeg" width="200" align="left">  Keynout has several goals, including - to convey the spirit and essence of what will happen next couple of days.  This report will focus on typical performance testing issues and possible approaches to solving them.  Andrey Akinshin is working on the <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/">Rider</a> project, is a manteyner of <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet">BenchmarkDotNet</a> and, in general, knows a lot about micro-optimizations. <br><br clear="all"></p><br><h2 id="patterns-for-high-performance-c-from-algorithm-optimization-to-low-level-techniqueshttpsdotnext-moscowru2017msktalks3dzbwqxenm6eqkai4giygw">  <a href="https://dotnext-moscow.ru/2017/msk/talks/3dzbwqxenm6eqkai4giygw/">Patterns for high-performance C #: from algorithm to low-level techniques</a> </h2><br><p>  <em>Federico Lois, Corvalius</em> </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yj/ae/wt/yjaewtuckklp2jktagk1sjfzhw0.png" width="200" align="left">  In this report, we will look at the techniques and patterns used to write high-performance code ‚Äî from analysis to the specific implementation of optimization.  Let us figure out how to understand what optimization to use, and what problems usually arise when optimizing the database code.  Many of these techniques were invented and polished to a mirror shine when developing <em>RavenDB 4.0</em> - a fresh version of the NoSQL engine for the .NET platform.  <em>RavenDB</em> is a rather complicated thing, in which optimization has been going on for nanoseconds for a long time, and it is necessary to optimize in time, IO and processor simultaneously.  Most of the techniques discussed in this report can be applied anywhere, regardless of language or framework. </p><br><p>  Federico went a long way to be able to tell about his discoveries.  He is not only a co-founder of Corvalius and Codealike, but he has actually worked on the performance of algorithms for the last ten years, using both CPU and all kinds of tricky hardware like GPUs as hardware.  This is a person who is not afraid of working with binary data, registers and low-level optimization, and at the same time fascinated by the technology of parallelism and modern computer graphics.  In general, if anyone can tell a report on low-level optimizations in C #, then this is it. <br><br clear="all"></p><br><h2 id="model-pamyati-nethttpsdotnext-moscowru2017msktalks3g9dliup84imoeeyukce0w">  <a href="https://dotnext-moscow.ru/2017/msk/talks/3g9dliup84imoeeyukce0w/">.NET memory model</a> </h2><br><p>  <em>Valery Petrov, Sidenis</em> </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pk/00/01/pk0001cxzwufgcjfwbvbidp6cve.jpeg" width="200" align="left">  Anyone else have questions after Federico's report?  Maybe someone scares concurrency (and for good reason)?  Valery Petrov will ease our fate with a detailed story about the memory model. </p><br><p>  Interestingly, at work, Valery is mainly engaged in a "bloody enterprise", and there is a myth that "enterprise" programmers are not interested in such things, do not understand them, and in general at work it is not necessary.  Well, the myth is destroyed! </p><br><p>  So what is the matter and why should we be interested in it at all?  Programs are usually written by people, and executed by a computer.  During the existence of a computer, a lot of work has been done to reduce the threshold for entering programming: now it is not necessary to know how a computer works in order to be able to make it do something.  However, nothing is given in vain, and behind the high-level languages ‚Äã‚Äãare hidden many delightful things.  In some cases, ignorance of what is happening ‚Äúbelow‚Äù can lead to sad consequences.  And when it comes to concurrency and cross-platform, then there are dragons with underwater rakes. </p><br><p>  In this report, Valery will tell you what the memory model is, what it is in .NET, what the specifications warrant to us, what the platform gives, what problems can be expected when leaving the comfort zone: moving to lock-free, running on other architectures (for example, ARM).  It will also be shown that some problems can be found by a simple static analysis (the report is not about static analysis, so the details are separate).  Among other things, it will be shown that there are also bugs in .NET. <br><br clear="all"></p><br><h2 id="poedinok-net-core-protiv-javahttpsdotnext-moscowru2017msktalks2une17wri88koasqqwgyek">  <a href="https://dotnext-moscow.ru/2017/msk/talks/2une17wri88koasqqwgyek/">Duel: .NET Core vs. Java</a> </h2><br><p>  <em>Vitaly Yezepchuk, Fast Reports</em> </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qk/sb/ai/qksbaiitzoomktutsp0hswaicyo.jpeg" width="200" align="left">  Even in the performance section there are nice light reports.

Perhaps it should be attributed to the "clouds", about which is written below. </p><br><p>  Maarten has long noticed that users are very strange people.  At least in his project <a href="http://myget.org/">MyGet.org</a> wild things are happening.  If they are very lucky, users will actually <em>use the</em> service, but most likely, they will abuse trust in all possible ways.  They use it strangely and unusually, which increases the workload, fills it with requests immediately after the end of the weekend, etc.  All this is a real danger to the web application, it can interfere with both the work of a single user, and put the entire service.  Therefore, ideally, you need to have some kind of smart filtering system, waiting for the user at the entrance, and controlling the number of requests per unit of time, the amount of traffic, and so on. </p><br><p>  In this report, Maarten will talk about the simple, and at the same time, such a complex world of query terminators.  We have to decide what and where to restrict - in the application, on the server, on reverse proxy like nginx, on external services like Azure or CloudFlare and so on.  As a result, the wolves are fed and the sheep are safe - and the service is working fine, and the users are happy. <br><br clear="all"></p><br><h2 id="debugging-and-profiling-net-core-apps-on-linuxhttpsdotnext-moscowru2017msktalks2dfoltply8kscqeoa6444g">  <a href="https://dotnext-moscow.ru/2017/msk/talks/2dfoltply8kscqeoa6444g/">Debugging and Profiling .NET Core Apps on Linux</a> </h2><br><p>  <em>Sasha Goldshtein, Sela Group</em> </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/5x/ir/1s/5xir1sutgqh5td_ayczr3myy_5e.jpeg" width="200" align="left">  In our hardcore "low-level" section there are two reports related to debugging.  And both - about cross-platform applications. </p><br><p>  The first report is led by Sasha Goldstein - an outstanding performance engineer who invariably occupies top positions at all conferences, no matter where he speaks.  We interviewed him several times, I advise you to familiarize yourself with: a <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/jugru/blog/283582/">couple of videos of 2015</a> , <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/jugru/blog/314224/">videos of 2016</a> , <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/jugru/blog/320620/">interviews about working with a performance,</a> and a <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/jugru/blog/328294/">review of the tools of the .NET performance engineer</a> . </p><br><p>  In this report, Sasha will talk about the following.  Imagine having managed to run your favorite ASP.NET application on Linux or even something with a console interface.  What's next?  A happy ending?  Oh no.  In fact, you will have to face memory leaks, strange crashes, performance problems, and many other troubles - and what to do when it all happens in production?  On Windows, we have a bunch of interesting tools, but they won't work in Linux, and there are no simple alternatives yet.  In this report, Sasha will talk about how debugging and profiling of .NET Core applications on Linux now look like.  How to investigate using <code>perf</code> , how <code>LTTNG</code> used as a replacement for <code>ETW</code> events, how to compile and understand LTTNG <code>LTTNG</code> , and much more.  Sasha will talk about collecting <em>core dumps</em> , and how to get information interesting for the .NET developer using <code>lldb</code> and <code>SOS</code> .  This report will be a very difficult journey through the wilds of unfinished utilities and special command line magic, but in the end we will come to a happy end!  (but it is not exactly). <br><br clear="all"></p><br><h2 id="tonkosti-otladki-mono-prilozheniyhttpsdotnext-moscowru2017msktalks5p07ss2dq46sqoymkkcsae">  <a href="https://dotnext-moscow.ru/2017/msk/talks/5p07ss2dq46sqoymkkcsae/">Mono application debugging tricks</a> </h2><br><p>  <em>Elizaveta Golenok, Gotech</em> </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/4l/w2/0r/4lw20r9ojnz-txeuzhauzdbt6b8.jpeg" width="200" align="left">  The second debug report, and again the cross platform.  However, after Sasha's report, it is already clear that we cannot see a simple life on Linux :-) </p><br><p>  This report is very practical.  One of Elizabeth‚Äôs real work tasks for this year is to make the existing legacy project (WCF, Web API, MVC, Web Forms) cross-platform.  This task is rather classical, however, during the migration process, many problems arise, one of which is the debugging of Mono applications. </p><br><p>  Elizabeth will tell how to make the process of debugging Mono-applications more convenient / comfortable, she will show how the process of debugging actually takes place.

Like any other isolated module, microservice can be easily replaced or rewritten, or even horizontally scaled without the risk of regressions.  Microsevreis can be loosely coupled part of a distributed architecture, but they can be used separately, by themselves.  This architecture has many advantages, and not so many disadvantages.  More importantly, it is more common than it is customary to talk about.  ‚ÄúMicroservices‚Äù is just a special name for anything that is not a well-developed, comprehensive system. </p><br><p>  In this report, Dino will share with us the painful experience of developing a microservice architecture, during which his company built the infrastructure in many stages, having very limited resources, collecting the results by brick and trying to ensure that when adding new Kripikov, the old ones would not fall off . </p><br><p>  Dino is a well-known trainer, consultant and evangelist, a CTO of a rapidly growing IT company.

The abstraction of the distributed log that underlies Kafka makes it possible to use it as a queuing system, but it also provides some very useful advantages that are inaccessible even to ESB-level solutions. </p><br><p>  In this report, under the strict guidance of Denis Ivanov, we will analyze the basic principles on which Apache Kafka is built, we learn how and in what cases its use allows us to solve problems simply and efficiently. </p><br><p>  But most importantly, we will consider the real use of Apache Kafka in a system that has a microservice architecture and the backends of which are implemented on .NET Core and Scala.  It will tell you about the wonderful Reactive Extensions library and show how using a reactive approach allows you to keep the code simple, reliable and extremely productive. </p><br><p>  The report does not forget the features and nuances, which are always very much when we make microservice applications, and even with such a set of technologies.

In the context of the report, it is interesting that Dylan is a system architect who right now is working on building complex modern distributed applications and, accordingly, on developing the right APIs for them.  And he will probably play us on the guitar, at a party after the first day of DotNext with Vagif. </p><br><p>  But back to the report.  The point is that we have been working all our life on systems created by other people.  Starting from a simple UI on the phone, and ending with the cloud infrastructure of the modern Internet - the interaction between systems and users is the foundation for our understanding of the technology and sensations from its use.  If you build the right interaction, users will be happy and will work productively.  If the platform leaves only bad impressions, it only leads to inefficiency, fear and anguish from using such a product. </p><br><p>  Whether we are aware or not, every time we create new programs, we also create user experience.  People will interact with our code ‚Äî as end users, or maybe as members of the development team.  Or maybe they are mobile application developers using your API, or is it someone who needs to go to the night to fix the problems that have arisen.  From the outside, this may seem like quite different cases, but in fact they have something in common.  Dylan calls this the word " <em>discoverability</em> ."  (I do not specifically translate this word, because the report will still be in English, and in English it has more meanings than the Russian equivalent of ‚Äúintelligibility‚Äù). </p><br><p>  In this report, Dylan outlines ideas and discoveries relating to user experience, API design, psychology and psychology of learning, and shows how you can integrate the idea of <em>discoverability</em> at all architectural levels of the application.  There will be illustrations on real big projects, with explanations of how <em>discoverability</em> works with different interaction paradigms.  It doesn't matter if you create databases or system libraries, hypermedia API or mobile applications - one day there will be a moment when someone starts interacting with your code - and when this happens - it‚Äôs better that they are satisfied, right? <br><br clear="all"></p><br><h2 id="provaydery-tipov-bez-boli-i-magiihttpsdotnext-moscowru2017msktalks50ktyyngfsuoqeqmiykkw6">  <a href="https://dotnext-moscow.ru/2017/msk/talks/50ktyyngfsuoqeqmiykkw6/">Providers of types without pain and magic</a> </h2><br><p>  <em>Roman Nevolin, EPAM</em> </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/n5/lr/3w/n5lr3wauaezus5n6ndhha2nkn5q.jpeg" width="200" align="left">  <code>Newtonsoft.Json</code> is the most popular package in NuGet.

You could already hear the first version of the report, and this is not a repetition. </p><br><p>  Version 2.0 of the report will be about the built-in mechanisms for preventing attacks in ASP.NET, <strong>augmented and expanded after the release of .NET Core 2.0</strong> .  We look at the new Microsoft web framework from a security point of view. </p><br><p>  In the report, Mikhail will talk about the differences in security features ASP.NET of different versions and analyze how the built-in protection mechanisms against XSS and CSRF now work, what cryptography features are available out of the box, how session management is organized. </p><br><p>  The report will be of interest primarily to developers writing secure ASP.NET applications, specialists conducting security review of .NET projects, and everyone who wants to understand the implementation of security components using the example of this platform.  ,    ,        . <br><br clear="all"></p><br><h2 id="pobezhdaya-inekciihttpsdotnext-moscowru2017msktalks7alwdnxp0kayquoukwmky8">  <a href="https://dotnext-moscow.ru/2017/msk/talks/7alwdnxp0kayquoukwmky8/">Beating injections</a> </h2><br><p> <em> , Positive Technologies</em> </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zv/gd/-t/zvgd-t9utczlujzq3qt4ukm7nek.jpeg" width="200" align="left">  The second report is about security, and it has exactly the same practical orientation.

What will be considered art?  How will we do the usual things, how will we do business? </p><br><p>  Dino will tell us a story - a fictional story - which can be considered science fiction.  Or a special cellular fiction.  In 2008, one guy made Bitcoin.  To manage Bitcoin, you need to use a common registry - Blockchain.  Blockchain is a public registry for transactions - in the future, transactions of any type.  Imagine that someone went further, on a couple of levels.  Blockchain spread throughout the world, and became the basis for absolutely everything.  Banks, notaries, government - in short, any third-party certifying authorities - were on the verge of disaster. </p><br><p>  Imagine that in 2048 the whole world turned out to be entirely based on Blockchain, and any transaction in it is visible, traceable and verifiable by anyone.  Imagine a world in which people dress in RFID-connected clothing connected to Blockchain.  Any step you take is also monitored (by the way, now they are watching 2017 too!).  Your location is well known to everyone, all the actions I recorded.  Imagine a world in which computers deal with most of the most tedious tasks you‚Äôve ever met in life - they make decisions for you, drive a car for you, order plane tickets for you, buy different things for you - and even write for you programs. </p><br><p>  Imagine a world in which only thoughts and dreams are all truly yours, and they are the only pleasant thing that you still have.  (No, I do not think that computers will have sex for you, even in 2048!).  Will it be utopia or anti-utopia?  A world without deception, envy and crime.  Full of honesty, freedom, love.  (And yes, free love is like the kind that hippies dreamed of in the 70s, but much better).  Time will tell, and time flies very quickly. </p></div>
