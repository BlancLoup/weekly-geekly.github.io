  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Professional 2: Sony Ericsson Xperia pro review</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  One of the last, which reached the hands of the editors of this blog, the new products of 2011 in the Xperia lineup - <b>Sony Ericsson Xperia pro</b> - suddenly turned out to be one of the best.  Introduced in February of this year in Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãthe Sony Ericsson Xperia pro is the ideological heir to the first Xperia smartphones with a large screen and a sliding QWERTY keyboard, the Sony Ericsson Xperia X1 and X2.  A couple in the current "release" of Xperia pro is an entertainment smartphone Xperia neo, identical in characteristics and similar in size, but without a sliding keyboard. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/d9d41bb5/a743b823/e2d346a5/d0a1f9a8.jpg"><br><br>  All Xperia models of this year are built on the same hardware, and Xperia pro is no exception.  In fact, this can be considered a victory of communism within a single line of smartphones: technically everyone is equal, it remains only to choose the design, screen size, weight and form factor to taste.  On the other hand, thanks to the unification, models with top-end filling (like that of the flagship of this year, Xperia arc) are available in a price range of <a href="">less than $ 300</a> .

    <a name="habracut"></a>  Therefore, we will not focus on the technical side of the issue in the case of Xperia pro, we will list only the main TTX models: <br><br>  <b>Weight and dimensions:</b> monoblock size 57x120 mm and 13.7 millimeters in thickness, 140 g weight <br>  <b>Screen:</b> 3.7 inches, 480x854 pixels, capacitive, multitouch, with auto-rotate <br>  <b>Processor:</b> Qualcomm 8255, 1 GHz <br>  <b>OS:</b> Android 2.3.4 <br>  <b>Battery:</b> Li-Ion, 1500 mAh capacity <br>  <b>Memory:</b> 1024 MB internal, 320 MB of memory for applications available, 8 GB microSD card included, up to 32 GB supported <br>  <b>Camera:</b> 8.1 megapixels, with autofocus, flash and 8x digital zoom, <b>shooting panoramas and 3D panoramas</b> <br>  <b>Video:</b> up to 720p (1280x800), 30 fps <br><br><h4>  Equipment </h4><br>  The smartphone comes in a standard box, which indicates the main advantages of this model: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/7ed8d8b6/23b157cd/0ae2b045/2035fa02.jpg"><br><br>  Included with the smartphone are: a memory card of 8 gigs, a 1500 mAh battery, headphones with a remote control, an adapter from microUSB to USB complete with a plug for charging from the mains and a meter HDMI cable, as well as a set of different papers and replaceable earbuds ". <br><br>  By the way, on the adapter for the charger is the GreenHeart logo - the <a href="http://www.sonyericsson.com/cws/company-press-and-jobs/sustainability/greenheart%3Fcc%3Dru%26lc%3Dru">environmental concept of Sony Ericsson</a> - which means, for example, in this case that it is made from recycled plastic.  Buy phones that think about nature!  A trifle, but nice. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/4c66303a/d73b8cb6/eb5c2ffc/8dfd0277.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Body and ergonomics </h4><br>  Xperia pro is a fairly tightly knit side slider.  The thickness of the case and the barely noticeable deflection of the back cover allow it to lie very comfortably in the hand, the back cover does not play, but on my copy it barely squeaks, the keyboard extends with a pleasant effort.  The gap between the moving parts is minimal, so from the side of the pro it looks almost like a candy bar. <br><br>  Connector for the charger / data transfer is located in the most convenient place for this - at the top of the smartphone, and the L-shaped micro-USB adapter is the same as the Xperia arc.  But the power / lock button is not so well located, on the left side, under the 3.5 mm audio jack, which makes access to it with the headphones connected a bit difficult. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/008c5402/9fcee7d9/bab60cb5/6fa49a4d.jpg"><br><br>  On the right is a volume control rocker, a camera button and an HDMI connector, the cable to which is included. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/954eefc7/9acc05d9/a7b65672/1d5eacd5.jpg"><br><br>  In front - the traditional three ‚Äúiron‚Äù keys (Back, Home and Menu) and the front video camera - you can arrange video chats on Skype or in Google Talk and do self portraits. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/eec23357/eb3001f8/563e1da1/80c88753.jpg"><br><br>  A video icon has been added to the Google Talk contact list in Xperia pro, which means that a video call is possible: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/9f34e0b7/339c3ed0/fd4b5964/ed7452ab.png"><br><br>  On the back cover there is a speaker slot, the ‚Äúear‚Äù of the microphone of active noise cancellation and a camera lens with a flash. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/e35ca6b9/1caeec47/fad49746/08127822.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Screen </h4><br>  The 3.7 "diagonal screen holds 854x480 pixels in itself, that is, it contains as much information as it does on the‚Äú big ‚ÄùXperia arc. The picture with the‚Äú improving ‚ÄùMobile Bravia Engine technology is bright and juicy, and the‚Äú grain ‚Äùon this The display is almost impossible to see.The dimensions and resolution of the Xperia pro display make it possible to use it as a regular touchscreen smartphone - in this sense it is not inferior to models with a similar diagonal. <br><br>  Like other Xperia models, it is covered with ‚Äúnon-scratch‚Äù mineral glass, but it never came to check its protective properties for the whole year, because all the phones were still sealed with a protective film at the factory - if I hadn‚Äôt written about it in each review, then many of its users, perhaps, would not have noticed.  As in the old TV ads: if you have scratches on the screen - just <s>wipe it off and</s> change the film. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/6bfd558e/b3ee4617/95292fd5/cf479084.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Keyboard and text input </h4><br>  The main feature of this smartphone is, of course, its ‚Äúfull-size‚Äù (on the scale of mobile devices, of course) keyboard.  It has 42 buttons - as many as on mini pro, but the buttons themselves, of course, are a bit longer and the distance between them also seems a bit larger.  Like on a good laptop, the buttons are separate and therefore, after some practice, they allow ‚Äúblind‚Äù input. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/be94e1c4/900dd418/8985bf2b/8fa934fa.jpg"><br><br>  The full version of the Russian keyboard did not fit in, but the ‚Äúinjured‚Äù letters X, B, F, Y are used quite rarely and therefore it is not necessary to resort to upper case.  But a full-fledged switch unit provides easy navigation through the text, allowing you to quickly navigate through the lines and edit the typed - correct one letter at the beginning of the word using the keyboard, much easier than using only the touchscreen.  In addition, the arrows can be used to navigate the phone menu or application menu. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/a614bce0/d894dd08/48b970b7/d28c966b.jpg"><br><br>  The button for switching the input language is also located separately, another pleasant moment is the individual comma keys and periods in any layout.  Perhaps the only drawback of the Xperia pro QWERTY keyboard is that it generally needs to be pulled out and that the screen orientation changes. <br><br><h4>  Text functions </h4><br>  Smart Keyboard - contextual function that predicts possible user actions when opening the keyboard depending on the application used - in the mail program, for example, the choice is ‚ÄúReply, Reply to all or Forward?‚Äù, In the browser - the address entry and search field opens, in the message menu - A new message or reply message box appears.  However, as long as it works only with the native email client or the default WebKit browser, this function does not work in the Gmail or Opera mini email client. <br><br>  The Type &amp; Send function allows you to type text and then choose where to send it, offering a choice of recently used applications or sending text on social networks or via SMS: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/298b1e6a/129286e8/41c5f813/b1617bb0.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/034ab4b0/3a4d2abe/fd4b006a/e8e697a3.png"><br><br>  Here's how it works: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/a8ceb45d/26182415/814674d4/96991850.jpg"><br><br>  You can open the keyboard at any time and start typing text into the search field, but by clicking on the Google icon next to it, you will see a list of options: in addition to the standard web search and Android Market search, there are more messages, search for music files and support. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/a5ceb6a0/692446a7/ebfb48f9/d7ba2e52.png"><br><br>  Perhaps this is the case when the definition of "business smartphone" fits perfectly - and what else, if not a business?  The keyboard and related software are sharpened by the regularly arising need to write and edit relatively long (for mobile devices) texts ‚Äî for example, letters.  In order to write a book or an article, it‚Äôs still better to use more traditional methods of typing, and regular phones do an excellent job with sending SMS.  But you write a typical business letter in a couple of paragraphs - and you immediately understand why you need a slide-out keyboard with the Type &amp; Send function. <br><br><h4>  Work with documents </h4><br>  Mail handling features are complemented by the pre-installed OfficeSuite Pro application.  It allows you to view and edit text documents and presentations literally on the go, providing all the basic functionality familiar to MS Office: editing and formatting text, searching text and document statistics. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/31c940a7/eb4a971e/408fe0b9/1397b28a.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/dab51f9b/072add40/c86eac44/982c913b.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/abbca572/62feb796/d630ce0c/292392a2.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/8beee944/9b7388d4/4f9d9608/81610cbf.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/079dc3d9/502d0bf0/e5d96ea9/71e02d22.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/e48f9dc5/5347436a/9aed50c1/83c92f07.png"><br><br><h4>  Photo and video </h4><br>  The camera interface of the Xperia pro standard, added only the ‚Äúturn‚Äù button, which allows you to take self-portraits or video yourself. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/7c8f49a0/0f61b814/35e6fe8c/32aa18f5.png"><br><br>  Like other Xperia phones after updating the firmware, pro allows you to take panoramic photos and 3D panoramas. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/dee262dc/a5050781/e1362574/2fb1472d.png"><br><br><h4>  Summary </h4><br>  Basic phone calls look like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/51001ff6/e1845213/530fae75/e93cbebf.png">  Large screen with a resolution of 480x854 <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/51001ff6/e1845213/530fae75/e93cbebf.png">  Enlarged QWERTY Keyboard <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/51001ff6/e1845213/530fae75/e93cbebf.png">  Pre-installed OfficeSuite Pro <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/51001ff6/e1845213/530fae75/e93cbebf.png">  Front-camera <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/51001ff6/e1845213/530fae75/e93cbebf.png">  Low cost <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/d9da1edb/df50d50b/53a69e1f/6c254b3c.png">  Inconvenient location of the power button. <br><br>  In my opinion, now Xperia pro is the best phone in the Xperia lineup.  A bit more compact than the arc, but with the same screen resolution and a slightly longer-lived battery (the screen is smaller!), It always has a trump card in the sleeve in the form of a sliding keyboard and advanced text-processing options.  For someone's taste, it may be too big - but this is a matter of purely individual preferences.  Someone prefer the elegance of Xperia ray, someone needs an unkillable Xperia active, and someone wants the same thing, but in an even more compact Xperia mini pro wrapper.  All smart phones are good, choose to taste. <br><br>  <b>PS</b> ‚ÄúProfessional-1‚Äù is a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/sonyericsson/blog/126949/">review of the Sony Ericsson Xperia mini pro</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/133591/">https://habr.com/ru/post/133591/</a></p>
