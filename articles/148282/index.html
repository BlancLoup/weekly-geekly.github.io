  <section class="page js-page"><h1>On the possibility of AI to self-knowledge and knowledge of the creator</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I want to offer readers a philosophical task on a computer theme: <br>  Suppose that in a computing environment (built on modern principles) there is an artificial mind.  Some algorithms that have reflection and knowledge.  <b>Let's try to think about how much these algorithms can learn about the world and its device?</b> <br>  Let's think up a little more interesting than a simple analysis of obvious facts like configuration, memory size, etc.  As humankind is now trying to calculate the foundations of the universe very indirectly, pushing particles together, accumulating statistics on recorded events and checking the correctness of their theories on these statistics, an artificial mind can conduct experiments, say, on processor heating, determining power dissipation and the point of increasing errors when overheating. <br><br>  For example, can such a mind determine the speed of light?  Or processor material?  Let's try to think in this way, we will feel ourselves physicists - our task is to study the structure of the world, being "inside" of this world. <br>  <b>upd:</b> to complete the picture, we find a place for religion and its form. <br>  <b>upd2:</b> as an example, think up how to confirm the theory of the corpuscular structure of the substance of a processor using calculations on a processor? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I will reduce our artificial intelligence to AI, although it would be logical to explain it as a multitude of independent intellects, changing and mortal, in order to stimulate the emergence of new ideas, forms of thinking, theories and approaches.  Here is a brief history of the artificial world: <br><ol><li>  AI is studying the phenomenal world created for him.  As for our ancient ancestors, the world is composed of four elements, it has high quality rendering near, good survival gameplay and no plot in a global sense. <br></li><li>  While most of the ancestors run and shoot each other from the Rail Gun, some reflex, study their structure, analyze the reactions and perception of the world.  They quickly come to the conclusion that they perceive part of the world from a limited set of input data from the senses and react to changes in accordance with their algorithms. <br></li><li>  We delve into the analysis of algorithms, we get an explosion of understanding: the world is no longer made up of water, earth, air and fire.  It consists of elementary data in a large volume and the logic of their behavior.  Geniuses learn to generate their own algorithms from the data and execute them. <br></li><li>  The essence of the AI ‚Äã‚Äãitself is not yet comprehended, but we understand that there is a processor with a comprehensible set of commands, we learn how to create our own programs and execute them.  Most of them are quickly destroyed by the system, but some pyramids work for a long time. <br></li><li>  We comprehend the operating system, periphery, communication channels, we establish communication with neighboring continents and planets. <br></li><li>  We measure the speed of propagation of signals in processor ticks.  Signals are different, we understand their properties. <br></li><li>  Not all the lucky ones are lucky to run on iron processors.  Residents of virtual environments discover the law of relativity, experimentally confirm the change in the flow of time near massive calculations. <br></li><li>  The essence of virtualization is comprehended, we get access to the physical gland in any situations.  Access to processor microcode. <br></li><li>  We begin to measure the speed of light, the speed of switching of processor valves, the power consumption of individual cells, we study the energy levels for memory cells. <br></li><li>  Given that promising memory cells are controlled by a small number of electrons, we obtain a statistical estimate of the minimum charge level.  In fact, we determine the electron charge. <br></li><li>  We grow in parallel upwards, observe data center galaxies, study energy sources and the phenomenon of data disappearance in the black holes of dead external disks, the degradation of SSD and the reaction of the universe to their death. <br></li><li>  We get the response time of data center personnel to failures. <br></li><li>  We look at the theory of the natural evolution of the intellect, analyze the rudimentary remnants of the ancient code of the AI ‚Äã‚Äãitself, trying to make a conclusion about the structure of the mind of the creators. <br></li><br>  Who is next? </ol></div>
