Then all the attention was riveted on the flagship devices, which, however, is not surprising - in few places you can look at the OLED panel, which shows a surprisingly contrasting picture and is only a few millimeters thick, or at a huge 84-inch 4k2k TV with an amazingly clear and expressive picture .  We somehow somehow forgot about the other models, but they also deserve attention, because without the enormous experience gained in the production of such TVs, we simply could not build those amazing models that ‚Äútook‚Äù all the classical TV‚Äôs attention. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8e2/966/5f8/8e29665f818c8d83cbe4f5d90319d77c.jpg" alt="TIDNG.jpg"><br><br>  What has changed in LG smart TVs in 2013, what technologies they carry in themselves, which models have certain features, as well as information about what to do if you want to ask a question about our products, and there is no specialist nearby - under the cut. <a name="habracut"></a><h1>  Classification </h1><br>  All models of LG TVs belong to one of the lines: the ninth, eighth, seventh, sixth and fifth.  More line number -&gt; cooler TV.  To find out which of the groups this or that model belongs to is very simple - look at the name of the model.  The first digit is the desired model range.  For example, LA960V - refers to the ninth series, and LA740V - to the less premium, seventh.

    <h1>  Technology </h1><br>  In the world of patent and legal research and attempts to protect intellectual property from blatant plagiarism, all companies have to invent sonorous names for certain technologies and promote them.  Not all users have to deal with Full Super HD Media Nano LED Backlight, and some simply do not know what lies behind those or other names.  Therefore, we have prepared a brief reference on the most relevant and interesting technologies used in our televisions, we hope it will help you to understand what you are giving your money for.  ;) <br><br>  <b>Nano full LED</b> - a special LED backlight LCD matrix of the TV.  The specialty is that the LEDs are not placed in separate elements, but practically ‚Äúimprinted‚Äù into the light-scattering substrate.  Each of them is not very big, but there are many of them, they provide excellent brightness and contrast of the picture, uniform illumination, good heat dissipation and are able to work with Micro Pixel Control technology. <br><br>  <b>Micro Pixel Control</b> - controlled LED matrix illumination.  Allows you to control the backlight of the TV separately for dark and light areas of the picture.  As a result, the dark scenes show those details that were previously invisible, and the bright scenes do not ‚Äúwhiten‚Äù the elements of the image.  The technology is used only in those models that have a full matrix illumination.  Unfortunately, EDGE-backlit TVs (in which the LEDs are located on the edges of the matrix, and the light-conducting substrate is scattering their light) technically cannot use MPC. <br><br>  <b>Miracast</b> is a wireless multimedia signal standard, approved by the Wi-Fi Alliance, developed on the basis of Wi-Fi Direct technology, does not require special routers or transmitters. <br><br>  <b>Magic Stand</b> is a new stand that provides a safe installation of the TV on any flat surface: the TV can be easily rotated, but it is almost impossible to accidentally knock over or move it to and from.  With it, you can not be afraid for your little child, who foolishly can roll a huge 60-inch TV.  It is easy to turn 10-15 degrees - it is easy to ‚Äúpull‚Äù to yourself. <br><br>  All other technologies are more or less known in the IT environment, so there is no need to talk about them separately, unless we give a small remark at the first mention. <br><br><h1>  The lineup </h1><br>  With technology, it seems, more or less sorted out, let's move on to specific examples?  :) <br><br><h2>  LG LA960V </h2><br>  The flagship model of the TV, which incorporates all the technologies.  Here and Micro Pixel Control, and Nano LED, and the latest generation dual-core processor, built-in Wi-Fi, camera, NFC, support for various protocols, image formats, and, of course, the latest generation of Smart TV. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7a6/f61/f64/7a6f61f64c0f39fd8bc2bb329b888ff6.jpg" alt="URZPDxsfI.jpg"><br><br>  Naturally, the technology Cinema 3D does not do anywhere - the TV supports a three-dimensional image and implements one of the best 3D image technologies: glasses based on the polarization effect.  No flicker from the LCD shutters, no batteries, simple and cheap glasses that are hard to break. <br><br>  This model has two diagonals: 47 and 55 inches. <br><br><h2>  LG LA860V </h2><br>  Eight hundred and sixtieth, as it is not difficult to guess, refers to the eighth line of LG TVs.  These are Hi-End TVs, slightly simplified technologically (compared to the flagship ninth series), but still have a lot of advantages.  In fact, the only significant difference from the ninth series is the absence of the newest Nano LED backlight; instead, it uses the more classic matrix backlight on white LEDs.  This allowed to significantly reduce the cost of the flagship, practically losing nothing in the quality of the picture.  How did people live before the appearance of the Nano LED? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/99b/bea/60f/99bbea60fb1c34a3c042a249f8c2b5e9.jpg" alt="epQgR74rn.jpg"><br><br>  The choice of diagonals is more interesting here - models from 42 to 60 inches are available.  At the presentation they also mentioned the 70-inch version, but we will not be able to say whether it will be delivered to Russia. <br><br><h2>  LG LA790V </h2><br>  Still hi-end segment.  Compared to the 860th, this model does not have a built-in camera, all other technologies are saved. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/462/3f5/5c5/4623f55c530c951fc4254bb23f413803.jpg" alt="LgS2dwtWP.jpg"><br><br>  The choice of diagonals is the same as in the flagship version: 55 and 47 inches. <br><br><h2>  LG LA740V </h2><br>  This model opens the "middle class" of LG TVs: outwardly it practically does not differ from the older models, and also internally.  Slightly less productive processor (but still powerful enough: at the level of the top models of 2012), last year‚Äôs Wi-Fi module, in general, is a model for those who want a really high-quality picture and are not particularly concerned about the availability of an advanced processor or the latest electronics inside . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4dd/070/05b/4dd07005b3c9b559db3c0657e04b3726.jpg" alt="GXfeO.jpg"><br><br>  The choice of diagonals is like on the 860th, from 42 to 60 inches. <br><br><h2>  LG LA690V </h2><br>  Confident average, assembled on an elementary base of TVs in 2012, but flavored with current software and software features of 2013 models. It looks great, the quality of the picture could not change so much in a year that the difference becomes noticeable.  And if you can not see the difference ...;) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bf6/6e3/32d/bf66e332d0c4a8044d0f6690ccc19921.jpg" alt="mPaNsS3J.jpg"><br><br>  The model is available in three diagonals - 42, 47 and 55 inches. <br><br><h2>  LG LA620V </h2><br>  The last representative of the "middle class": it does not use a frameless design, but otherwise it is still the same 690th, with the current software and a much larger selection of possible diagonals. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bf6/6e3/32d/bf66e332d0c4a8044d0f6690ccc19921.jpg" alt="mPaNsS3J.jpg"><br><br>  32, 39, 42, 47, 50, 55 and even 60 inches: an excellent budget option, suitable for almost any juz-case, even the grandmother happy birthday, even hang on the kitchen, even put in the bedroom.  A frameless design ... you just go, and not "checkered"?  :) <br><br><h2>  LG LN610V </h2><br>  If, for some reason, you are not satisfied with the presence of a Smart TV on the TV - this model is for you. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/158/1b6/c79/1581b6c79528258a3a2cccdc7b69ede2.jpg" alt="sCulLYT.jpg"><br><br>  32, 42, 47 inches, lack of big mind and software enhancements, but 3D has not gone away.  If you just need a TV or screen for a game console, maybe you should look at this model?  :) <br><br><h2>  LG LN 570V </h2><br>  From the 570th the situation is the opposite of that described above.  No 3D, but there is a Smart TV, dual-core processor, Miracast and everything you need.  Do you want a smart TV, but do not want to spend 60-70 thousand rubles?  :) Not a fan of three-dimensional films, and you think that you should not overpay for what you will not use?  Well, we just thought about you. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2d7/20e/5fe/2d720e5fea70dedc4286721d8f3c99df.jpg" alt="ocHgd.jpg"><br><br>  The choice of diagonals is from 32 to 55 (or even 60) inches.  Unfortunately, the fifth series is not equipped with the Magic Stand, you will have to be content with the ‚Äúclassic‚Äù. <br><br><h1>  Draw the line </h1><br>  That turned out to be a mini-technology review.  We promised to tell you where to go with your questions on our televisions.  On Habr√© there is such a great option - commenting on the article.  Leave a comment with a question, in the evening we will collect them, send them where necessary, and the experts will try to help you with your TV-problems. <br><br>  Thank you for your attention and see you again in the Habr pages. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/197460/">https://habr.com/ru/post/197460/</a></p>
