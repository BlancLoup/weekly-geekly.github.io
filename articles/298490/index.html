      Social media expert Dan Zarella, together with KISSmetrics, HubSpot and Search Engine Land, <a href="https://blog.kissmetrics.com/science-of-social-timing-3/">conducted his own research</a> on how to choose the best time to post blog posts. <br><br>  According to the data, the best day to publish materials in the case of American companies was Monday.  At the same time, articles published after 11 am received the greatest coverage. <br><br>  At the same time, the largest number of comments, readers left to the materials published on Saturday after 9 am.  The greatest number of external links get articles that were published on Monday or Thursday after 7 am. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/765/cbe/e26/765cbee260f7437c96e2624d9228ab52.png"><br><br>  In turn, Noah Kagan <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/noah-kagan/why-content-goes-viral-wh_b_5492767.html">analyzed data from the BuzzSumo service</a> for 100 million publications.  He found out that the materials published on Tuesday get the most ‚Äúsheirs‚Äù on social networks and, as a result, the most views.  However, LinkedIn and Pinterest users, by contrast, prefer to share links to blog posts on Monday. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6c1/a7a/e26/6c1a7ae26eba4301bb6bbafe58980893.png"><br><br>  <i>I advise you to read - <a href="http://boosta.ru/content-marketing/kontent-razvedka-zachem-nuzhno-i-kak-delat-16-ekspertnyx-mnenij-2/">Content Intelligence: why you need and how to do?</a></i>  <i><a href="http://boosta.ru/content-marketing/kontent-razvedka-zachem-nuzhno-i-kak-delat-16-ekspertnyx-mnenij-2/">(16 expert opinions)</a></i> <br><br><h4>  The situation in Russia </h4><br><br>  We at <a href="http://www.rockinrobin.co/">Rockin'Robin</a> also analyzed statistics on blog publications and media made by Russian b2b and b2c companies for several years of <a href="http://www.rockinrobin.co/portfolio/">work</a> .  Below is an analysis of this information. <br><br><h4>  As we thought </h4><br><br>  During the study, we analyzed 400 publications of companies operating in the b2b and b2c segment, which were posted on blogs at Habrahabr, Geektimes, Megamind, Spark.ru and other sites, as well as in a number of online media (for example, vc.ru) . <br><br>  Analysts examined 200 publications made by seven companies of the b2b segment, and 200 materials published by three companies of the b2c sector.  All analyzed texts were posted on the Internet from January 2013 to December 2015. <br><br>  <b>Companies whose publications were studied in the course of the analysis operate in various industries:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  SaaS cloud services, </li><li>  Finance, </li><li>  Ecommerce </li><li>  Retail, </li><li>  Email marketing </li><li>  Marketing, </li><li>  Design and usability, </li><li>  Software development, </li><li>  Investment business. </li></ul><br><br>  We wanted to know when companies prefer to publish their materials, and how good results they can achieve. <br><br>  <i>I advise you to read - <a href="http://boosta.ru/content-marketing/kak-uvelichit-kolichestvo-repostov-kontenta/">How to increase the number of content reposts</a></i> <br><br><h4>  Lyrical digression: What do people like more </h4><br><br>  200 materials published by companies operating in the b2b segment, at the time of preparation of this publication, read 1,968,500 times, and the average number of post views was 9,840. <br><br>  At the same time, the publication of companies working directly with private clients caused a much greater response from the audience - the total number of views of 200 posts in the sample was 3,429,100, and the average number of views of one article was 17,145. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c37/492/8ab/c374928ab9464ccebbaa3fc4b6fe5c2b.png"><br><br><h4>  When companies prefer to publish </h4><br><br>  The analysis has shown that b2b companies more often publish their articles on Tuesday and Thursday - 29% and 21.5% of all publications made: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9a8/e12/926/9a8e1292669f49c0adff13ed003a4397.png"><br><br>  At the same time, representatives of the ‚Äúconsumer‚Äù segment more materials are posted online on Thursday (23% of publications) and Friday (19%), although Tuesday (18%) is very popular: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ab2/b0c/1f1/ab2b0c1f197d42529551941694f4a133.png"><br><br>  As can be seen from the statistics, business representatives in our country are still skeptical about the placement of publications on weekends - the total number of publications made on Saturday and Sunday, the company and the segment b2b and b2c do not reach the indicators of weekdays with minimal activity. <br><br>  The dislike of weekends and Mondays can be explained by the confidence that these days the activity of the audience is seriously reduced in anticipation and after the rest.  It also seems that a significant part of the company's full-time marketing specialists post publications only during their working hours and do not carry out any activity on weekends. <br><br>  <i>I advise you to read - <a href="http://boosta.ru/content-marketing/prokachaj-kontent-marketing-16-rabochix-sposobov-chast-1/">Upgrade content marketing: 16 working methods.</a></i>  <i><a href="http://boosta.ru/content-marketing/prokachaj-kontent-marketing-16-rabochix-sposobov-chast-1/">Part 1</a></i> <br><br><h4>  What days are the best read articles? </h4><br><br>  Despite the fact that b2b-companies are much more often publish their materials on Tuesday, according to statistics, on this day the average number of views is at an extremely low level - an average of 6313 views.  Worse articles are read only on Friday.  The second most popular day for publications, Thursday, showed good results with an average number of views (16534). <br><br>  At the same time, the companies that decided to publish their materials on Saturday managed to achieve the best results - the average number of views of such articles was 17,741. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eed/cbe/09c/eedcbe09c06b47f0a1b56b7d330ac508.png"><br><br>  As mentioned above, in the case of the b2c segment companies, the distribution of popular days for publication looks different ‚Äî this is Thursday, Friday and Tuesday.  Here, the best results were achieved by those companies that posted their articles on the Internet on Tuesday (21,383 views on average). <br><br>  However, as well as in the case of b2b companies, the day when the audience read the published materials most actively became Saturday - an average of 35,220 views of one article. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cf6/eb8/b9c/cf6eb8b9c7a84a07b3f2952b330cae0d.png"><br><br><h4>  What does all of this mean </h4><br><br>  An analysis of 400 publications created by Russian companies in the b2b and b2c segments allows us to highlight several key facts. <br><br>  1. <b>Publications of "consumer" companies, in general, read better - this fact can be explained by the fact that it is easier for readers to associate the goods and services offered with their needs.</b>  In addition, there are much higher chances that a person who reads material about some b2c product has encountered it in his life. <br><br>  2. <b>The largest number of corporate publications falls on Tuesday and Thursday (in the case of b2c, also on Friday).</b>  The decision on the choice of the day of publication is influenced by several factors - the final readiness of the material, the presentation of marketers and managers about when it is better to publish it to get the most coverage, the framework of the working week.  Their combination leads to the fact that Russian companies most often place their articles in blogs and online media on Tuesday and Thursday, and in the case of the b2c segment, another popular day is Friday. <br><br>  3. <b>Weekends are undervalued - at this time, corporate publications are almost not published, while the average number of their views are at levels higher than on weekdays.</b> <br><br>  4. <b>Readers are very active on Saturday - and for companies of the b2b segment, and for their colleagues operating in the "consumer" market, the best results of the average number of views of publications were achieved on Saturday.</b>  But there are differences in the behavior of the audiences of these companies - the articles of representatives of the b2b segment are well read on Sunday (the third day of effectiveness), but readers of materials from b2c companies almost never pay attention to them. <br><br>  <i>I advise you to read - <a href="http://boosta.ru/growth-hacking/growth-hacking-27-realnyx-kejsov-chast-1/">Growth Hacking: 36 real-life cases - Part 1</a></i> <br><br><h4>  Conclusion: no need to be like everyone else </h4><br><br>  <b>The important point is that high-quality content ‚Äúcomes in well‚Äù on any day of the week</b> , but with the help of competent timing of its publication, you can further improve the results. <br><br>  The following conclusion can be drawn from the facts sounded above: in order <b>to get the maximum coverage of their materials, companies should not post them on Tuesday and Thursday</b> ‚Äî these days the competition for the attention of the audience with articles from other organizations will be maximum. <br><br>  At the same time, on weekends - in particular, <b>on Saturday - the audience readily consumes textual content, and competition for its attention will be minimal.</b>  People have nothing to read on weekends, and companies in this period almost do not publish anything - the ideal situation is to get maximum coverage for their materials. <br><br>  You can learn not only how and when to publish your materials, but also how companies can create interesting texts from our <a href="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/rockinrobin/RockinRobin_The_Book.pdf">free e-book</a> . <br><br>  If you want your friends and colleagues to learn more about Content Marketing, share this article on social networks.
