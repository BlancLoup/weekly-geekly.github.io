As a rule, recruiters are guided by certificates and skills specified in the resume, without being able to accurately determine the qualifications of the applicant.  The most suitable (in their opinion) candidates are immediately sent for an interview directly to the company that opened the vacancy.  With this approach, the process of recruiting qualified personnel can be very long and take up to six months, while most of the candidates are eliminated inside the company, during interviews with technical experts, distracting employees from work and causing them to be dissatisfied with large then low-qualified candidates. <br><br>  A long search for candidates does not suit either recruitment agencies, neither employers, nor the candidates themselves.  For effective recruitment, we launched a new service for assessing the qualifications of specialists in the field of information security <b>‚ÄúHR lab‚Äù</b> , which allows us to quickly and accurately determine the level of qualification of specialists.  The service is equally good both for recruitment agencies, and for employees of HR departments. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  One of the strengths of our company is customer satisfaction.  In the HR lab, we continue this tradition with the help of special testing techniques.  Their essence is extremely simple and logical: together with the customer, a block of practical tasks is created for candidates, including tasks for the security of web applications, cryptography, network security, etc.  The agreed tasks are implemented in a specialized laboratory that imitates a corporate network with vulnerabilities inherent.  According to the results of the passage of the laboratory, our specialists conduct an interview with a candidate, who asks additional questions to more accurately determine the level of knowledge.  Upon completion of testing, the customer receives a report including test results and prof.  applicant's orientation, as well as our recommendations. <br><br>  Testing areas <br><ul><li>  RF legislation: FZ-152, 382-P, 161 FZ (STO BR IBBS, PCI-DSS); </li><li>  requirements of regulatory and supervisory authorities to ensure information security;  requirements of international standards and best practices for information security (ISO 27001, ISO 22301, CobiT); </li><li>  modern threats and vulnerabilities: technologies, methods and means of GI (including at various levels of the ISO / OSI model); </li><li>  risk assessment of information security breaches;  skills in conducting internal testing of the company's infrastructure and compiling reports indicating the degrees of risk; </li><li>  developing effective security policies; </li><li>  methods and methods of IP protection (including the following technologies: protection against malicious code, DLP, GIS from unauthorized access, security analysis scanners, IDS / IPS, firewalls; </li><li>  monitoring information security events (DLP, SIEM, AntiFraud, etc.); </li><li>  database and database protection technologies; </li><li>  administration of popular operating systems and services. </li></ul><br>  Such an approach enables the applicant to demonstrate in practice the professional qualities required by a potential employer.  In addition, the customer receives complete information about the applicant's level of training in areas important to the customer, saving time (on average, it takes less than ten hours to complete the HR lab, with the possibility of a break at any time).  The final interview with our specialist will not allow the candidate to resort to outside assistance while working in the laboratory.  Our expert, having a detailed report on the work, will additionally perform an oral test on all assignments, focusing on those that occupied the candidate the most time.  Applicants who fail to complete tasks will at least be aware of the gaps in knowledge and, in consequence, will always be able to improve their qualifications in the desired field.  Thus, the HR lab service will allow to quickly fill a vacancy by a qualified specialist, saving the customer‚Äôs time and money.  The average cost of testing specialists for closing a single vacancy is 25,000 rubles and depends on the requirements for candidates.  More information about the service can be found on the <a href="https://www.pentestit.ru/train/hr-lab">website</a> . </div>
