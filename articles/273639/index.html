The Singaporean team that won $ 100,000 became the winner of the daily marathon on December 5-6. <br><br><twitter-widget class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered" id="twitter-widget-0" style="position: static; visibility: visible; display: block; transform: rotate(0deg); max-width: 100%; width: 500px; min-width: 220px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;" data-tweet-id="673647266838614018"></twitter-widget><script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The main goal of all hackathons was to invent and implement new applications for the banking sector and trade, for which participants were given access to the Mastercard API.  In just one year, more than three thousand developers, designers and entrepreneurs took part in hackathons. <br><br>  The winners were announced on December 11th.  They turned out to be 5 people from the <a href="http://www.hackathon.io/moneyremaid">MoneyRemaid</a> team.

At the same time, they are not always able to conveniently dispose of the money earned, and also have to put up not only with high commissions for remittances to their families, but also with the arbitrariness of employers, who can easily not pay the agreed amount. <br><br>  The word <a href="http:">MoneyRemaid</a> itself is composed of the words money (money), maid (maid) and remaid (redone).  The platform's prototype allows you to automate salaries and payments, reduce money transfer costs, and also buy high-yield banking products.  A clear positioning, a correct understanding of the market and the customer, as well as, obviously, the final characteristics of the resulting prototype ensured the victory of the Malaysian team. <br><br>  According to the team member, Gwen Yi, who <a href="http://www.gwenyi.com/2015/12/">in her blog said</a> that, in her opinion, ensured victory in the hackathon, the participants at each stage were given the task of creating a business, and not just a product or a solution.  In the rules it is formulated as " <a href="http://mastersofcode.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Masters-of-Code-Participation-Agreement.pdf">Each project must be a ready-made case</a> ."  The focus on this result, obviously, influenced the composition of the team, in which, apart from the developers, entrepreneurs also had a role, who only recently began to master programming - among them Gwen herself.  They competently distributed their roles - two entrepreneurs, two developers and one designer - and created a prototype of MoneyRemaid solutions for the safety of money earned by Southeast Asian home staff.  The team used Ruby on Rails to develop its platform and - for the mandatory condition of the hackathon - used <a href="https://developer.mastercard.com/portal/display/api/MoneySend%2520API">MoneySend</a> and <a href="https://www.simplify.com/commerce/">Simplify Commerce</a> . <br><br>  As a prize, the team received seed investments of $ 100,000, participation in the <a href="https://www.startpath.com/">MasterCard StartPath</a> start-up incubator <a href="https://www.startpath.com/">program</a> , 6 months of mentoring, as well as interest-free processing of transactions in the amount of up to $ 250,000 in the <a href="https://www.simplify.com/commerce/">Simplify Commerce</a> system. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/zmmyr8G_lrA%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgU0Y2pwUCqbZayNXEZ8CUYtusbcg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <i>Live event report from Mashable on Snapchat</i> <br><br><h3>  Results of the year </h3><br>  It would be wrong to mention only the winners, forgetting about the efforts of other participants of the ‚ÄúMasters of the code‚Äù.  The PaymentEye portal has compiled a list of five more interesting payment projects created on these hackathons: <br><br>  <b>1. <a href="http://www.hackathon.io/cointr">Cointr</a></b> <br><br>  A startup from Sydney, who created a gamified pig piggy bank, where anyone who wants to make a handful of small things, and the user distributes his savings for certain purposes.  It is based on the <a href="https://www.mastercardrepower.com/">MasterCard RePower</a> technology, which allows you to throw at the expense of a handful of little things in the nearest supermarket (provided that it is connected to the system). <br><br>  <b>2. <a href="http://www.hackathon.io/master-your">Master Your Card</a></b> <br><br>  Despite consonance with another initiative of <a href="http://www.mastercard.com/corporate/responsibility/master-your-card.html">MasterCard</a> itself, this startup created a product that allows children to be taught how to manage their budget.  This is a kind of ‚Äúchildren's bank card‚Äù, which can only be paid if it is authorized by its elders - in this case, parents. <br><br>  <b>3. <a href="http://www.hackathon.io/webusking">WeBUSKING</a></b> <br><br>  The winner of the intermediate stage in Tel Aviv, a team of two people - a certain Yuri and Max Shakurov.  They took the idea that the easiest payment is to throw a coin into the cap of a street performer.  And they created a platform for these performers, where they can broadcast their performance, and the audience can make a small donation.  <a href="http://webusking.com/">The project site</a> promises a grand opening in 2016. <br><br>  <b>4. <a href="http://www.hackathon.io/mobil-bayi">Mobil Bayi</a></b> <br><br>  A vital and simple solution that allows you to see the rest of your pass on the Istanbul metro through your phone using NFC.  <a href="http://odemeteknolojileri.com/2015/10/06/nfc-tabanli-yerli-uygulama-mobil-bayi-silikon-vadisinde-yarisacak/">The application</a> used gamification - small games that you can play while you go to the subway.  Coin won in them can also be used to travel. <br><br>  <b>5. <a href="http://www.hackathon.io/51696">FareShare</a></b> <br><br>  Applications like Uber have gained their popularity, including thanks to the new FinTech direction - the ability to split the bill between several payers.  Canadian startup FareShare automatically takes the user's payment history and gives him the functionality to share any of them with someone else.  Hackathon judges especially noted the successful user identification functionality in the system. <br><br>  Which of these startups will shoot - time will tell.  In turn, MasterCard will pay for education and take part in the development of a winning startup, which means that MoneyRemaids will probably take its place in the product line in the local market. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://www.keytree.co.uk/masters-of-code-london-winners/">All of Us</a></b> <br><br>  Well, from myself, we note the application on the organization of evenings with friends and joint payment of the bill from the winner of the London stage, which we <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/edison/blog/240017/">talked about last time</a> . <br><br>  <i>Follow the news of the world of development</i> <br> <a href="http://www.edsd.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/398/998/a96/398998a96bd342d18422b1dbb66a271e.jpg" width="400"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/273639/">https://habr.com/ru/post/273639/</a></p>
