We collected a great feedback and partially corrected the mistakes that you sent us.  And so, back to our latest update, about 15 days ago we released a new version of HackStore 2.0.5, the main innovation of which is the payment system.  Now users of our store can buy applications in one click with a credit card, PayPal, Amazon and several other options.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/246/a83/ee4/246a83ee424447e2a7ff5a98ec244035.png"><br><br>  This was made possible through partnership with the <a href="http://fastspring.com/">FastSpring</a> payment system <a href="http://fastspring.com/">,</a> which is a very flexible solution for online payments.  Many of our partners like <a href="http://macpaw.com/">MacPaw</a> have been using this system for a long time.  In our case, we have a fairly large number of applications and FastSpring turned out to be the only company on the payment system market that allows you to add a large number of applications to their system directly using the API.  But before concluding an agreement with FastSpring, we tried to negotiate with some Russian companies in this area, for example, we communicated with <a href="http://payler.com/">Payler,</a> but as it turned out, Russian banks were not so flexible that we could not agree with them. <br><br>  Unfortunately, Payler does not work directly with banks and waiting for confirmation from the bank took quite a lot of time, besides for Russian banks it is an unknown type of business and many of them are accustomed only to unpretentious online commerce simply decided not to get involved with us.  Returning to FastSpring, I note that they have a slightly higher commission percentage than our banks, but this is all offset by the flexibility in withdrawing funds.  We are pleased to announce that we are ready to connect any developers who wish to distribute their applications through our store to the FastSpring system. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/881/c94/aaf/881c94aaf69c45b0a6998876d42dd09d.png"><br><br>  We also entered into a partnership agreement with <a href="http://www.desktopad.com/welcome.php%3Fvid%3Dwp-2015libz">DesktopAD</a> and now we are ready to offer developers to embed advertising directly into any Mac application.  Together with them we are working on a competitive advertising system, and we are trying to equal the Apple iAD.  In our developer center at <a href="https://hack-store.com/for-developers">https://hack-store.com/for-developers,</a> we are ready to offer a variety of advertising options for your applications.  I plan to write a separate article about our advertising partnership, all the same I would like in this article to tell more about the innovations in the application itself. <br><br>  In the last update, we also added the ability to download trial versions of paid products for sample by our users. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cd8/39d/eeb/cd839deeb9884d7c89e0ad5c7aae66d9.png"><br><br>  We believe that this is exactly what the AppStore lacks, because applications on a Mac are on average much more expensive than for iOS.  CleanMyMac 3 and Hider 2 from MacPaw were among the first paid applications. <br><br>  And in this update, we fixed a lot of minor errors and flaws, we try to become better with each update and we are glad that you are helping us with this!  Of course, it is difficult to describe all the innovations in one publication, we will write again.  I want to say thank you again.  We are waiting for your comments, comments and also your applications in our store! <br><br>  Website: <a href="https://hack-store.com/">hack-store.com</a> <br>  FAQ: <a href="https://hack-store.com/faq">hack-store.com/faq</a> <br><br>  We are in social networks: <br><br>  <a href="https://twitter.com/HackStoreTeam">Our Twitter</a> <br>  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/HackStoreTeam">Our FaceBook</a> <br>  <a href="http://vk.com/hackstoreteam">Our VKontakte</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/291002/">https://habr.com/ru/post/291002/</a></p>
