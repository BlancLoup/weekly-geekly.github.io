They call it <a href="http://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a> . <br>  When, looking back at the success of Facebook, our fellow tribesmen decided that it was worth <br>  repeat, then the path of total cloning was chosen. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  At the moment, the V Kontakte network, like Facebook at the time of its takeoff, <br>  experiencing an avalanche of user activity growth and growth rate <br>  PPU (Pages Per User).  Users "in contact" generate an average of 100 <br>  page views of the social network per day - an unprecedented number in the domestic <br>  the internet.  Advertisers love it!  But Facebook has been like that for a few years. <br>  back, then registrations and pageviews began to decline, but it was invented <br>  something that brought life back to the service and raised its likely cost from $ 750 million <br>  in 2006 to $ 15 billion in 2007.  This ‚Äúsomething‚Äù is a platform for third-party <br>  developers who were able to give their web applications an increase <br>  a huge Facebook audience, and Facebook itself to give a shot of adrenaline, which <br>  so he needed at that moment.  The creators of "In Contact" have not been able to repeat <br>  this step is facebook and yes let's see if they need it at all in the present <br>  moment and will need in the future? <br>  Paradoxically, but our social network has become for its participants total <br>  substitute for almost all means of communication in the modern world.  Network "In Contact" to my <br>  environment, almost replaced the phone (to negotiate group pastime <br>  all became exactly here), e-mail, ICQ and many others.  Many people use the network <br>  to remind yourself of birthdays and just for the usual "forum" communication <br>  in local groups - now you do not need to have a bunch of registrations, as it is now happening <br>  with scattered forums.  Unlike the same "Classmates", there really is <br>  it is convenient to communicate, and nobody cares at all that there is no communication history <br>  search.  If you project all this, at first glance, unsophisticated functionality <br>  on the domestic average internet user then becomes <br>  it is clear that there is nothing more to add here.  What will third-party developers give <br>  of this network, if you let them to the army of the user "in contact"? <br>  If you look at the most popular Facebook applications, it‚Äôs not hard to see <br>  that they are not distinguished by their special adaptability, but are parasitic on desire <br>  users to be noticed, on shyness. <br><img src="http://www.roiber.ru/img/upload/4801b9a6b0930df561aff1a66f01560a.jpg" width="467" height="342"><br><br>  <i>‚ÄúThink your friend is a hot little thing?‚Äù</i>  <i>Tell him about it and raise your</i> <i><br></i>  <i>rating!"</i> <i><br></i>  <i>‚ÄúPoke is not enough for you!</i>  <i>Your friend?</i>  <i>Then use the ‚Äúpush‚Äù tools,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>‚ÄúHug‚Äù or even ‚Äúthrow a sheep‚Äù! ‚Äù</i> <i><br></i>  <i>‚ÄúShow your state of mind with the color of your heart!‚Äù</i> <br><img src="http://www.roiber.ru/img/upload/7b68b9a8a51982cdb38d1b62785addb9.jpg"><br><br>  There are other applications on Facebook that integrate full or partial <br>  functionality of other web services on Facebook.  For example, I have tested applications <br>  to work with Gmail, LinkedIn, Last.fm, Skype, etc. The functionality of these applications <br>  extremely poor in most cases.  Another attack is that users <br>  addicted to adding more and more applications make <br>  your profile so that you can safely call "my dump 2.0".  Fairness <br>  It is worth noting that the creators of these applications have a number of motivational reasons <br>  create on Facebook: <br>  1. Earn advertising, which can be placed according to certain rules <br>  in facebook apps. <br>  2. Grow your user base by Facebook users, because the executable <br>  application code is not stored on Facebook servers - remote services only interact <br>  with it through the API, building your constructions with a special markup language <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook_markup_language">Facebook Markup Language</a> . <br>  Many applications require registration on parent services, even without leaving <br>  Facebook itself. <br>  Now let's go back to the realities of the domestic Internet.  Will the creators <br>  sites to write applications for "in contact".  Certainly, but only <br>  not all and not immediately.  Most domestic services are developed by enthusiasts. <br>  But about millions of development investments, many only read in Western TechCrunch <br>  or Mashable!  In our reality, we should not expect an avalanche-like influx of quality <br>  services, as well as their independent ones are 2-3 orders of magnitude smaller than ‚Äúthere‚Äù.  More <br>  Moreover, the earnings model of the social network ‚ÄúV Kontakte‚Äù itself is not clear.  How is he <br>  will earn something to programmers of third-party services?  And about dominance in our <br>  Pentam spammers and their colleagues and say no - first on the open <br>  they will sit down to the platform, fishing for user data, most of which in <br>  the Internet very recently and will even give up the soul, if you describe the process beautifully and <br>  promise the golden mountains. <br>  Ask your secretary, who is already 100% registered "in contact", <br>  whether she needs to change something or add, whether she needs to watch videos RuTube <br>  on the web pages instead of the built-in player, does it need to integrate with <br>  Flickr or weather display from Yandex (after registering on the latter, of course). <br>  The answer is no, like the rest of the network users. <br>  If you go back to the creators and their strategy of nurturing the service, it becomes <br>  it is obvious that they are waiting for the peak of growth to get or maximum investment <br>  or sell the service with giblets to the next gasman / oilmen / coal miners (remember <br>  what is <a href="http://internetno.net/2008/01/23/gazprom-tube/">ruTube</a> <a href="http://internetno.net/2008/01/23/gazprom-tube/"><br></a>  <a href="http://internetno.net/2008/01/23/gazprom-tube/">was bought by Gazprom</a> ?).  Russia is great and the Internet will long go on <br>  taiga yurts, and yet their inhabitants will give a reporting growth prospect.  Facebook <br>  had a ceiling of growth, the number of Internet inclusions in the USA is almost constant <br>  Yes, and focused on the student audience can only increase the accuracy <br>  forecasts, and therefore, approaching the height of growth, the team was ready to offer <br>  "something else".  In the case of ‚ÄúV Kontakte‚Äù it will be very interesting to watch when <br>  the creators will see this floating ceiling and offer not just another SuperPoke! <br>  users, and an open platform for third-party applications that should <br>  be no worse than the current Facebook. <br>  Vyacheslav Baransky <br>  <strong>Source: <u><a href="http://roiber.ru/articles/11">Royber PC</a></u></strong> <br></div>
