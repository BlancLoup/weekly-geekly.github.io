  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Pro Steve Jobs and fresh solutions</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Sometime early in the morning, Steve Jobs came to work and immediately called in a marketing director. <br>  - Well, what is there with our iPhone?  - Jobs asked pulling out his Nokia from his pocket and putting it on the table.  - How are things going? <br>  - So-so.  Not very successful.  He said it was necessary to make a normal GPS. <br>  - Okay.  That's what I was thinking ... - Steve Jobs sat in the chair and put his feet on the table.  - Long time we did not let out powerful computers.  With these Airy and Fonds, an important market segment was forgotten.  It is necessary to make a very powerful graphics station.  8 gigabytes of RAM at least.  And soon all the designers on the PC will run away. <br>  ‚ÄúGood idea ...‚Äù the marketer thought.  - What do we call? <br><a name="habracut"></a>  - I also thought about it.  Well, since we will have a large computer, I suggest we call it ‚ÄúBig Mac.‚Äù  Just like I heard this name somewhere. <br>  - Yes, so like sandwiches are called in the eatery on the corner, a very dubious look. <br>  ‚ÄúDamn ...‚Äù Steve Jobs stood and walked over to the window.  ‚ÄúThen ... Since the idea is fresh, we‚Äôll call it McFresh.‚Äù  And the slogan: "McFresh - a fresh solution!". <br>  - Also‚Ä¶ <br>  - Which also? <br>  - They have a sandwich and with that name. <br>  - How?  They steal our ideas!  What is this zabigalovka called? <br>  - McDonald's. <br>  - I'll go there, even see what they are.  - Steve Jobs took his Nokia from the table, put it back in his pocket and headed for the exit. <br>  ‚ÄúOnly Steve, would you have it ...‚Äù the marketing director looked excited;  ‚ÄúYou wouldn't eat there ...‚Äù <br>  - Why? <br>  - Well, this is food for the poor.  You never know what ... <br>  - Oh, come on.  You have no idea what I was eating at the time. <br><br>  Two days later, the marketing director went to visit Steve Jobs in the hospital, where he lay with food poisoning.  He walked into the ward, and walked over to Steve, who was lying with his eyes slightly open. <br>  ‚ÄúHi! ..‚Äù the marketer greeted him warmly.  But Steve did not share his good mood: <br>  - Rename. <br>  - What?.. <br>  - Rename our products!  So that the word Mack was not there at all. </div>
