Today it became known that a second data center will soon be built, which will take on a significant part of the load.  This data center will be located in North Carolina.  By the way, this state is loved by many corporations that have their own data centers.  The fact is that the climate here is relatively cool, which saves energy during the operation of the cooling system - there is no need for ‚Äúvoracious‚Äù industrial air conditioners and other types of cooling systems.  And there are practically no climatic disasters, like hurricanes (there are no earthquakes).  And one more plus - in this state, relatively low electricity tariffs, which is another incentive for the construction of data centers here. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  The cost of building a new data center will cost the company $ 450 million, which even by the standards of such corporations is quite a lot.  Geographically, this data center will be located 120 kilometers to the west of the city of Charlotte.  By the way, the first data center is located in the state of Oregon, it is also not ready yet, but it will start working early next year.  Immediately after its introduction, the Facebook company will refuse to lease the production capacity of third-party companies.  It is right - it‚Äôs no good for a company with billions of budgets to use third-party resources.

      In principle, it is clear why this is happening - the company simply simply did not keep up with the growth in the number of users, and no one imagined that they would have to build their own data center.  But, as we see, it was necessary, and not one, but as many as two large data centers.  Number 2 will be built for about one and a half years, and after the readiness of the data center, there will be only about 50 people working in it, including ‚Äúcontract soldiers‚Äù and Facebook employees.  Thoughts on the need to create their own data center in North Carolina arose from the leadership of Facebook about a year ago, since that time, negotiations were held with the leadership of the state. <br><br>  Now the data centers of companies such as Apple, Google and IBM are already located here, so Facebook has quite interesting neighbors. <br><br>  Via <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/11/12/facebook_north_carolina_data_center/">theregister</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/108049/">https://habr.com/ru/post/108049/</a></p>
