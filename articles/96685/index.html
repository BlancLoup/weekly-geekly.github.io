And to be precise, it will be about the methods of communication via email. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  1. I had to somehow order a wardrobe.  Well, as the easiest way to get the most interesting offer, I chose the Internet.  Having visited one of the most popular message boards (it doesn't even matter in which country, I think the situation is the same everywhere) in the section ‚Äúfurniture to order‚Äù I selected about twenty (!) Offers that matched me most and sent them a request for a wardrobe that interests me . <br>  <b>Of the twenty companies I contacted by e-mail, only one answered me.</b>  <b>Subsequently worked with them.</b>

      2. I came across one interesting American online costume shop.  And the costumes are good and the prices are excellent, and taking into account the action (buy one - the second as a gift), my interest was extremely high.  That is, I was ready to give them my money with pleasure.  The question arose regarding international delivery.  In the order form, only States were present, but it was said on the site that they, in principle, are also engaged in international delivery.  Well, as they say, no question - I wrote them a letter with questions regarding delivery.  In general, I will not go into details, but within a month I sent them about four letters, moreover, changing addresses and not to mention my particular whereabouts (that is, an American could be in my place). <br>  <b>Two months have passed, but I have not received an answer to any email.</b> <br><br>  3. By occupation, I had to establish contacts with various companies several times.  The cases were different - somewhere there were common interests, somewhere we just informed the company about something or what it was interested in.  The bottom line is that everything was done via email. <br>  <b>On average, the speed of response to email, regardless of whose interests are discussed - one week.</b>  <b>I have even become an email associated with classic mail</b> <br><br>  <b>findings</b> <br>  I, unfortunately, do not have answers to the questions: ‚ÄúWhy so long?‚Äù And ‚ÄúWhy do not they answer?‚Äù.  But what is described above is common and regular.  It would seem - in the world of financial crisis and companies should cling to any opportunity to earn, but no.  One would think that some people simply do not know how to use electric mail, but then why should it be indicated everywhere?  For order?  It can also be assumed that the company may have a blockage with letters and they are physically unable to cope.  But why then do not set up an answering machine where it is explained in detail, and as an alternative and faster connection, do not suggest to call them? <br><br>  And these are just my rare contacts.  But I can guess how many transactions do not occur in the world, money is lost and misunderstandings arise due to neglect of e-mail as a modern means of communication. <br><br>  And a question on the topic: what, on average, is the maximum time period for receiving an answer to your email? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/96685/">https://habr.com/ru/post/96685/</a></p>
