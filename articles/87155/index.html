  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Computer Management with iPhone</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The topic may not be new, but there is a chance that the proposed options will be useful to someone. <br><br>  No matter how hard modern technologies are trying to transfer all the needs of humanity to one device, it‚Äôs still practically everyone has a home computer besides a smartphone (if there is one at all) and, for sure, a laptop or netbook.  This is a small overview of the programs for remote desktop management.  I remember earlier rAdmin was especially popular, but I constantly had to remember the ip-addresses and what is connected through what.  About 3 years ago I came across TeamViewer, the thing turned out to be much more practical and convenient, I still enjoy using it.  Somehow, over time, it took to manage the desktop of any machine from a portable device, with the advent of netbooks - this business has become easier, but constantly carry with me this small unit just as annoying.  Therefore, I thought about finding more advanced software for more compact devices. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Frankly, I do not use iPhon myself, I do not like it, and it is worth it.  But from time to time it is necessary to help <s>blondes to</s> users at work (set up mail, Internet, etc.).  I thought it would be convenient to use the iPhone to fully manage the desktop computer. <br>  Here is an overview of some of the programs.

The program has a pretty nice interface, and the convenience is not lowered.  You can get acquainted <a href="https://secure.logmein.com/RU/products/ignition/iPhone/">here</a> .  The program is not free, it costs 29.99 green presidents, but I think for that kind of money it is quite suitable for the program.  <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware%3Fid%3D299616801%26mt%3D8">Link</a> to the program in the AppStore. <br><br>  <b>Touchpad Pro</b> is also a good program for Screen Sharing.  Negative leaves only the installation process.  To do this, you need to put the VNC Server on your computer (if it is running Windows, for Macs, the program is already built into the system), configure it to fit your needs and go to iPhon.  The program itself is free, you only need to pay for multimedia buttons. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b55/ccc/b8f/b55cccb8f7b56468facb968cb045a0f4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Unfortunately, I myself did not manage to use it for the time being, so the question remains how the program itself is connected to the computer, because in the settings you need to specify the ip-address of the machine.  <a href="http://www.touchpadpro.com/">Link</a> to the official website of the program (in English) with a description and instructions.  In the network you can find cracks.  Although, the TouchPad Media Server program for managing most of modern media players costs only $ 5.  By the way, everything else, the program also works on the iPod Touch and on Microsoft platforms: Windows Mobile 5 and 6. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/137/e4d/e92/137e4de929d145e79fdfca72e22e07be.gif" alt="image"><br>  <b>Remote Desktop for Mobiles (RDM +)</b> is a program that, like LogMeIn, allows you to control a remote computer through a web browser.  Quite easy to install and maintain.  All you need is to go to the company's website, enter your registration data and select the device you need to connect.  It costs $ 9.99, bought in the AppStore.  Apparently, the program is written in Java, so it can work on almost any mobile device.  <a href="https://www.rdmplus.com/">Link</a> to the official website. <br><br>  In other matters, the presented programs may be a way to Moscow through China, there may be other simpler tools, but the broad functionality speaks for itself. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/87155/">https://habr.com/ru/post/87155/</a></p>
