      This project came about quite by accident.  Namely, after Natalia turned to me, an old friend of mine, who had a small business with a friend, selling plates, cups and other dishes at trade fairs and in her little shop.  She wondered if I knew of any practical program for keeping personal daily accounting, but so that it was extremely simple and at the same time accessible for interaction of several people at once. <br><br>  The task was formulated as follows: each of the business owners should be able to fix the current expense (one-time payment to the loader, daily payment to the seller, payment for the goods, rent of a place, etc.) and income (fixation of the proceeds received).  In short, everything that was previously recorded in a notebook or on pieces of paper that have an insidious habit of losing it would be good to put it in some safe place.  Evaluating the task as a simple ‚Äúone-off‚Äù, I climbed into a search engine to immediately throw Natalia a million links to applications for the iPhone / Android and online services. <br><br>  However, I rather quickly stumbled upon the fact that all the programs that came across did not suggest the necessary interaction in one system of several people.  For one - please.  And in any form.  From the abundance of the functional even the eyes ran.  But how to solve the question: who owes how much to whom, if the first one, for example, paid 12000 rubles for goods, the second - 5000 rubles, but at the same time gave out to the loader Vasya for two days of work 3300 rubles.  and saleswoman Valentina for 3 days of work 7200 r.?  Problem! <br>  It became sad - nothing could be found! <br><br>  Nevertheless, this task in itself seemed to me extremely interesting.  Immediately came up with many uses: <br><br><ol><li>  conducting joint business with friends (with a transparent display of income and expenses); </li><li>  housekeeping with the whole family; </li><li>  Buying in turns with colleagues something delicious for tea or birthday gifts; </li><li>  fixing borrowed money; </li><li>  co-financing of the upcoming party or trip (with a record of who, how much and for what paid). </li></ol><br>  and more darkness of application - depending on the circumstances of life. <br><br>  And in order to finally motivate myself (in the sense of not postponing), I reformatted this intricate task into a beautiful idea, namely, the creation of a certain socio-economic network.  Or rather, a kind of cloud service, which can be used by any user at his own request or at the invitation of his colleagues, business partners and just friends to conduct settlements.  Immediately arose, perhaps, not quite the original;), but the very saying name "In Calculation". <br><br>  How long, short, but after a month and a half, the site has earned.  Natalia, becoming on it the first client, was very pleased.  I advised only on the lack of a version for the phone.  But, as they say, in the absence of a stamp, they write in simple. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e1c/b2f/f8a/e1cb2ff8a172e9c55e6db026eb59c336.jpg"><br><br>  Since nearly a year and a half since, a little less than a thousand people have registered with the service.  Many now have several hundred or even a thousand entries in the system.  By the way, Natalia created as many as 2384 entries in my Vraschete network. <br><br>  What else do you want to say?  The service turned out to be workable, although not without flaws. <br><br>  Vraschete has built what is called ‚Äúfor oneself‚Äù (although it was created by a person trying to bring what he started to the logical end), so there are a number of problems that do not interfere with its use, but may not like much the advanced haber consumers.  The most obvious of them are: <br><br>  1. Not implemented the HTTPS protocol. <br>  2. There is no application for mobile platforms.  Site design allows you to use it from your phone, but there are no native applications.  By the way, if you want to put your hands on the implementation of the application - you are welcome. <br><br>  There are also pleasant moments :) After a long test, another important gap was closed - a convenient, quite universal data export was made for printing and viewing, for example, in Excel, and for uploading to the database.  Due to this, no user data can not be lost. <br><br>  The project is free.  As conceived by the author, the main functionality should continue to remain free.  Monetization is planned due to the provision of additional paid services and the placement of related specialized advertising. <br><br>  <b>UPD</b> Forgot to insert a link, correct;) <a href="http://vraschete.ru/">VRaschete.ru</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/223111/">https://habr.com/ru/post/223111/</a></p>
