She studies the interrelation of various parts of the brain and organs of speech.  Researchers are trying to find out what is happening in the brain during a conversation. <br><br>  The work referred to in the article focuses on the area controlling the larynx, including at the time of changing the pitch. <br><br>  The leading expert in the study was a neurosurgeon Edward Chang.  He works with patients suffering from epilepsy and performs operations that prevent seizures.  Chang monitors the activity of the brain of some of his patients with the help of special equipment. <br><br>  The team recruited volunteers for their research from this particular group of patients.  Connected sensors allow you to monitor their neural activity during experiments.  This method, - known as <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25AD%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2584%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">electrocorticography</a> , - helped scientists find the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe brain responsible for changes in pitch. <br><br>  Study participants were asked to repeat the same sentence out loud, but to emphasize different words each time.  This changed the meaning of the phrase.  At the same time, the frequency of the main tone also changed - the frequency of oscillations of the vocal cords. <br><br>  The team found that neurons in one area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe brain were activated when the patient raised his tone.  This area in the motor zone of the cortex is responsible for the muscles of the larynx.  Researchers stimulated neurons with electricity in this area, to which the muscles of the larynx responded with tension, and some patients involuntarily made sounds. <br><br>  Participants in the study also included the recording of their own votes.  This caused the response of neurons.  From this, team members concluded that this area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe brain is involved not only in changing the frequency of the fundamental tone, but also in speech perception.  This can give an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow the brain is involved in imitating someone else's speech - it allows you to change the pitch and other characteristics in order to parody the interlocutor. <br><br><h2>  Useful in the development of voice synthesizers </h2><br>  Journalist Robbie Gonzalez from Wired <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/one-sentence-with-7-meanings-unlocks-a-mystery-of-human-speech/">believes</a> that the results of the study may be useful in laryngeal prosthetics and allow patients who are deprived of voice to ‚Äútalk‚Äù more realistically.  This is confirmed by the scientists themselves. <br><br>  Human speech synthesizers ‚Äî for example, the one <a href="http://www.hawking.org.uk/the-computer.html">used by</a> Stephen Hawking ‚Äî can still reproduce words by interpreting neural activity.  However, they cannot place accents, as a person with a healthy speech apparatus would do.  Because of this, it sounds unnatural, and it is not always clear whether the interlocutor asks a question or makes a statement. <br><br>  Scientists continue to explore the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe brain responsible for changing the frequency of the fundamental tone.  There is an assumption that in the future speech synthesizers will be able to analyze neural activity in this area and, on the basis of the data received, build sentences in a natural way ‚Äî emphasize the right words with the pitch, formulate questions and statements intonation depending on what the person wants to say. <br><br><h2>  Other studies of speech patterns </h2><br>  Not so long ago, in the laboratory of Edward Chang conducted another <a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2018/05/410606/study-reveals-brain-activity-patterns-underlying-fluent-speech">study</a> that can help in the development of voice-forming devices.  Participants read out hundreds of sentences, in the sound of which almost all possible phonetic constructions of American English were used.  And scientists watched the neuronal activity of the subjects. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kh/gb/g8/khgbg8z2zdwezu0ivse857elefu.jpeg"><br>  <font color="#A9A9A9"><i>Photo <a href="https://pxhere.com/en/photo/345902">PxHere</a> / PD</i></font> <br><br>  This time, co-articulation has become a subject of interest - how the vocal tract organs (for example, lips and tongue) work when pronouncing different sounds.  Attention was given to words in which different vowels follow the same hard consonant.  When pronouncing such words, the lips and tongue often work differently - as a result, our perception of the corresponding sounds is different. <br><br>  Scientists not only identified groups of neurons responsible for specific movements of the vocal tract organs, but also found that the speech centers of the brain coordinate the movements of the muscles of the tongue, larynx, and other organs of the vocal tract, relying on the context of speech ‚Äî the order in which the sounds are made.  We know that language takes different positions depending on what the next sound in the word will be, and there are a huge number of such sound combinations - this is another factor that makes the sound of human speech natural. <br><br>  The study of all variants of co-articulation controlled by neural activity will also play a role in the development of speech synthesis technologies of people who have lost the ability to speak, but whose neural functions have survived. <br><br>  To help people with disabilities <a href="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/wcmc/2018/1013234/">,</a> systems that work in the opposite direction are used ‚Äî AI-based tools that help transform speech into text.  The presence of intonations and accents in speech is also difficult for this technology.  Their presence makes it difficult for artificial intelligence algorithms to recognize individual words. <br><br>  Employees of Cisco, the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology and the Higher School of Economics recently <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.03625.pdf">presented a</a> possible solution to the problem for converting American English to text.  Their system uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMU_Pronouncing_Dictionary">CMUdict</a> pronunciation <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMU_Pronouncing_Dictionary">database</a> and the capabilities of a recurrent neural network.  Their method consists in automatic preliminary ‚Äúcleaning‚Äù of speech from ‚Äúsuperfluous‚Äù overtones.  Thus, in terms of its sound, speech approaches that of spoken American English, without distinct regional or ethnic ‚Äútracks.‚Äù <br><br><h2>  The future of speech research </h2><br>  Professor Chang in the future <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2018/07/27/632298300/how-the-brain-helps-you-sing-or-say-what-you-mean">wants to explore</a> and how the brain of people who speak the dialects of Chinese.  In them, variations in the frequency of the fundamental tone can significantly change the meaning of a word.  Scientists wonder how people perceive different phonetic constructions in this case. <br><br>  Benjamin Dichter, one of Chang‚Äôs colleagues, <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2018-06-music-speech-linked-brain-area.html">believes</a> that the next step is to go further in understanding the brain-larynx relationship.  The team now has to learn how to guess what frequency the tone will choose the speaker, analyzing his neural activity.  This is the key to creating a natural speech synthesizer. <br><br>  Scientists <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/one-sentence-with-7-meanings-unlocks-a-mystery-of-human-speech/">believe</a> that such a device will not be released in the near future, but the study of Dichter and the team will bring science closer to the moment when the artificial speech apparatus learns to interpret not only individual words, but also intonation, which means adding emotion to it. <br><br><hr><br>  <i>More about sound in our <a href="https://t.me/audiomaniaRU/">Telegram channel</a> :</i> <i><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xq/5o/_r/xq5o_rmc8w8juvbckkxdgn5adaw.png"></i>  <i><a href="https://t.me/audiomaniaRU/621">How Star Wars Sounded</a></i> <i><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xq/5o/_r/xq5o_rmc8w8juvbckkxdgn5adaw.png"></i>  <i><a href="https://t.me/audiomaniaRU/607">Unusual audio gadgets</a></i> <i><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xq/5o/_r/xq5o_rmc8w8juvbckkxdgn5adaw.png"></i>  <i><a href="https://t.me/audiomaniaRU/624">Sounds from the world of nightmares</a></i> <i><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xq/5o/_r/xq5o_rmc8w8juvbckkxdgn5adaw.png"></i>  <i><a href="https://t.me/audiomaniaRU/625">Cinema on the plates</a></i> <i><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xq/5o/_r/xq5o_rmc8w8juvbckkxdgn5adaw.png"></i>  <i><a href="https://t.me/audiomaniaRU/610">Music at work</a></i> <i><br><br></i> <hr></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/422709/">https://habr.com/ru/post/422709/</a></p>
