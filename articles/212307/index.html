This was reported by a leading specialist of the department of information and public relations of the Internal Affairs Directorate of the Brest Regional Executive Committee Irina Blokhina. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      A 30-year-old resident of the city of Pruzhany, a player in a popular game dedicated to the tank theme, who had his account stolen, addressed the police with a statement.  In the police, the man explained that he had spent not only a lot of effort during the virtual battles, but also over 1,200,000 Belarusian rubles on the purchase and modernization of his IS-8 tank. <br><br>  After the appeal of a citizen, employees of the High-Tech Crime Disclosure Department of the Brest Regional Executive Committee contacted the game developers.  Thanks to their help, it was possible to establish that the missing tank is active and continues to "participate in battles." <br>  True, now they are not governed from Pruzhan, but from the Moscow Region. <br><br>  As a result, the attacker's account was blocked.  At the moment, the question of restoring the access of the affected player to his account is being resolved. <br><br>  According to the police, a player from Pruzhan suffered because of his own carelessness, since the ‚Äúhacker‚Äù managed to get access to his game account via e-mail, the password to which was quite simple and consisted of a combination of numbers in order. <br><br>  According to this fact, Pruzhansky ROSK opened a criminal case under part 2 of Article 349 of the Criminal Code - unauthorized access to computer information.  This is the third case in the last two years, but the criminal case is being initiated for the first time.  In addition, there is reason to believe that the Interior Ministry of the Russian Federation will be interested in the virtual hijacker, since there is a similar article in the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation.  It provides for punishment of a fine, or deprivation of the right to occupy certain positions or engage in certain activities, or arrest for a term of three to six months, or restriction of freedom for up to two years, or imprisonment for the same term. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/212307/">https://habr.com/ru/post/212307/</a></p>
