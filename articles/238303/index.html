This article is a little about something else - how to make it even safer to protect and about fail2ban still unknown in a wide range of new functions.  I will add right away - for the time being we will talk about the development branch, although it has been tested in combat for a long time. <br><br><h4>  Brief introduction </h4><br>  In the majority, fail2ban is installed from the distribution kit (as a rule, it is some kind of <s>stable</s> old version) and can be configured from the Internet in a few minutes.  Then it works for years without the intervention of the administrator.  Often, even logs that fail2ban seems to follow are not viewed. <br>  So, I was forced to write this post by a case that happened to one server of my good friend.  Classics of the genre - an abuse came, and the second followed it.  Well, the attacker was still lazy - he did not lose the logs, and he was lucky that logrotate was set up to keep logs for months. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It turned out to be pretty trite, they picked up a password for his admin mail, which was also a password for ssh (of course, without a key).  Not a root, but a vessel, with all that it implies.  His first question was: how to pick up - I have the same fail2ban there.  And here is just an ambush: not everyone imagines that it is not individual computers that are now engaged in the selection of passwords, but entire bot networks, by the way, they are wiser.  So, according to the logs, we found out that there is just such a case: I went through the botnet, and in practice, I found out its settings in fail2ban (maxRetry = 5, findTime = 600 and banTime = 600).  Those.  To avoid a ban, the network made 4 attempts within 10 minutes from each IP.  For a minute, the network has about 10 thousand unique IP = something more than 5 and a half million passwords per day. <br>  In addition, his mailer did a great folly - namely, a pause of up to 10 seconds, with a login with the wrong name.  Those.  find out that some names, including the admin, really exist, this grid was not difficult.  Then there was a targeted search for only passwords for existing names. <br>  I will not dwell on ‚Äúrepair‚Äù in more detail - this is a long story, and in general a topic for a separate article.  I can only say that everything was cleaned and everything was resolved with a little blood, and he got off with almost ‚Äúslight‚Äù fright. <br><br>  So, the idea to write an article arose after I (partially deserved) were expressed: ‚ÄúSo you knew about this and did not say anything, did not warn you.  Yes, and the solution is there and not shared.  Well, you bastard.  In short, therefore, the post - to be.

    <h4>  My fail2ban </h4><br>  I take security of ‚Äúmy own‚Äù servers extremely seriously.  In addition to the same fail2ban, always very custom, I have monitoring there and a whole lot more.  It just really pisses me off that because of the stupid gray mass, which allows you to take control of your botnets with your hardware, you have to kill a lot of time for protection (and constant maintenance and control in the future).  By the way, to minimize this control, I actively participate in development and fail2ban, and other projects from security. <br><br>  So, my latest enhanced version [sebres: ban-time-incr] allows you to display this annoying zoo once and for all (well, or until they adapt again).  This feature was often discussed by all the members of the community, but somehow they did not reach.  I lived in the form of separate scripts and some custom changes, until it was formed into a ready-made functional. <br><br>  In short, the system, remembering bad IP addresses, allows each time to dynamically (exponentially) increase the blocking time (banTime) depending on the number of previous bans (banCount).  In addition, each time reducing the number (maxRetry) of possible failures (failure) to the next ban.  It can be clearly seen in the following example: <div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">[Click to view LOG]</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><pre><code class="bash hljs">2014-09-23 20:05:31,146 fail2ban.observer [named-refused] Increase Ban XXX.XXX.XX.XXX (10 <span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment"># 5 days, 8:04:55 -&gt; 2014-09-29 04:10:24) 2014-09-23 20:05:31,120 fail2ban.actions [named-refused] Ban XXX.XXX.XX.XXX (_ # 0:15:00 -&gt; 2014-09-23 20:20:29) 2014-09-23 15:30:32,625 fail2ban.actions [named-refused] Unban XXX.XXX.XX.XXX 2014-09-20 23:24:14,620 fail2ban.observer [named-refused] Increase Ban XXX.XXX.XX.XXX (9 # 2 days, 16:06:18 -&gt; 2014-09-23 15:30:31) 2014-09-20 23:24:14,569 fail2ban.actions [named-refused] Ban XXX.XXX.XX.XXX (_ # 0:15:00 -&gt; 2014-09-20 23:39:13) 2014-09-20 21:10:36,708 fail2ban.actions [named-refused] Unban XXX.XXX.XX.XXX 2014-09-19 13:03:03,377 fail2ban.observer [named-refused] Increase Ban XXX.XXX.XX.XXX (8 # 1 day, 8:07:34 -&gt; 2014-09-20 21:10:36) 2014-09-19 13:03:03,361 fail2ban.actions [named-refused] Ban XXX.XXX.XX.XXX (_ # 0:15:00 -&gt; 2014-09-19 13:18:02) 2014-09-19 12:38:17,743 fail2ban.actions [named-refused] Unban XXX.XXX.XX.XXX 2014-09-18 20:13:23,647 fail2ban.observer [named-refused] Increase Ban XXX.XXX.XX.XXX (7 # 16:24:55 -&gt; 2014-09-19 12:38:17) 2014-09-18 20:13:23,620 fail2ban.actions [named-refused] Ban XXX.XXX.XX.XXX (_ # 0:15:00 -&gt; 2014-09-18 20:28:22) 2014-09-18 20:07:06,053 fail2ban.actions [named-refused] Unban XXX.XXX.XX.XXX 2014-09-18 12:03:53,282 fail2ban.observer [named-refused] Increase Ban XXX.XXX.XX.XXX (6 # 8:03:14 -&gt; 2014-09-18 20:07:05) 2014-09-18 12:03:53,266 fail2ban.actions [named-refused] Ban XXX.XXX.XX.XXX (_ # 0:15:00 -&gt; 2014-09-18 12:18:51) 2014-09-18 11:22:40,704 fail2ban.actions [named-refused] Unban XXX.XXX.XX.XXX 2014-09-18 07:11:12,200 fail2ban.observer [named-refused] Increase Ban XXX.XXX.XX.XXX (5 # 4:09:43 -&gt; 2014-09-18 11:20:54) 2014-09-18 07:11:12,160 fail2ban.actions [named-refused] Ban XXX.XXX.XX.XXX (_ # 0:15:00 -&gt; 2014-09-18 07:26:11) 2014-09-18 06:47:46,618 fail2ban.actions [named-refused] Unban XXX.XXX.XX.XXX 2014-09-18 04:37:29,972 fail2ban.observer [named-refused] Increase Ban XXX.XXX.XX.XXX (4 # 2:02:16 -&gt; 2014-09-18 06:39:44) 2014-09-18 04:37:29,967 fail2ban.actions [named-refused] Ban XXX.XXX.XX.XXX (_ # 0:15:00 -&gt; 2014-09-18 04:52:28) 2014-09-18 04:32:49,491 fail2ban.actions [named-refused] Unban XXX.XXX.XX.XXX 2014-09-18 02:55:05,706 fail2ban.observer [named-refused] Increase Ban XXX.XXX.XX.XXX (3 # 1:23:31 -&gt; 2014-09-18 04:18:35) 2014-09-18 02:55:05,698 fail2ban.actions [named-refused] Ban XXX.XXX.XX.XXX (_ # 0:15:00 -&gt; 2014-09-18 03:10:04) 2014-09-18 01:18:37,976 fail2ban.actions [named-refused] Unban XXX.XXX.XX.XXX 2014-09-18 00:40:09,592 fail2ban.observer [named-refused] Increase Ban XXX.XXX.XX.XXX (2 # 0:38:30 -&gt; 2014-09-18 01:18:37) 2014-09-18 00:40:09,548 fail2ban.actions [named-refused] Ban XXX.XXX.XX.XXX (_ # 0:15:00 -&gt; 2014-09-18 00:55:07) 2014-09-17 22:47:05,872 fail2ban.actions [named-refused] Unban XXX.XXX.XX.XXX 2014-09-17 22:32:05,804 fail2ban.actions [named-refused] Ban XXX.XXX.XX.XXX (_ # 0:15:00 -&gt; 2014-09-17 22:47:05)</span></span></code> </pre> </div></div><br>  It is clearly seen here, as each following ban prolongs the blocking time from 15 minutes (0:15:00) for the first time, up to more than 5 days (5 days, 8:04:55) after the tenth blocking.

When I finished this logic and rolled out into production, in a matter of days I got rid of almost all the evil that I used to see in my logs for years.  For example, now the average normal daily increase of my auth.log is somewhere around 20-50 lines, earlier on some servers it was hundreds and thousands of times more. <br><br>  So far this is a development branch, there is a pull request, the release is planned for now in version 0.9.2. <br>  Who cares, read more about the implementation and solution history here - <a href="https://github.com/fail2ban/fail2ban/pull/716">Ban time incr by sebres ¬∑ Pull Request # 716 ¬∑ fail2ban / fail2ban</a> . <br><br>  However, while this version will be updated to your server, a lot of time will pass - until the release is released on the mainline, while it is taken to the distributions ... The story is long, for example, the same debian still uses 0.8.x - that's why the article itself.  So shake hands, set ... profit. <br><br>  You can <a href="">get</a> this version here <a href="">fail2ban-ban-time-incr.zip</a> (sebres master branch). <br>  Port for debian-s: <a href="">ban-time-incr-debian.zip</a> (merged master debian branch, and although not the main line - I will try to keep it up-to-date if possible). <br><br>  Installing it is quite simple.  If you already had fail2ban installed from the distribution, save the old ‚Äúfail2ban.local‚Äù and ‚Äújail.local‚Äù from ‚Äú/ etc / fail2ban /‚Äù (Well, the old ones are better than the ‚Äúfail2ban.conf‚Äù and ‚Äújail.conf‚Äù ).  I would just in case (due to possible personal changes in filter and action) save the entire directory "/ etc / fail2ban /" somewhere. <br><br>  Next, we demolish the old distributive fail2ban, for example: <pre> <code class="bash hljs">sudo service fail2ban stop sudo apt-get remove fail2ban</code> </pre><br>  Actually installation: <pre> <code class="bash hljs"><span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">cd</span></span> /tmp unzip ~/downloads/fail2ban-ban-time-incr.zip <span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">cd</span></span> fail2ban-ban-time-incr/ sudo python setup.py install</code> </pre><br>  [UPD] Sometimes on some distributions, with a manual installation, for some reason the service is not installed (for example, there is no <code>/etc/init.d/fail2ban</code> file) - and accordingly the service does not (auto) start, only through <code>fail2ban-client start</code> . <div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">[What to do...]</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  This can be corrected by copying from the distribution kit or, for example, from the archive (then do not forget to correct the rights): <pre> <code class="bash hljs"><span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">cd</span></span> /tmp/fail2ban-ban-time-incr-debian sudo cp /etc/init.d/fail2ban ~/init.fail2ban.org sudo cp ./files/debian-initd /etc/init.d/fail2ban chmod u+x,g+x,o+x /etc/init.d/fail2ban</code> </pre>  And check inside the path to fail2ban-client ( <code>which fail2ban-client</code> ): <br>  - with <code>/usr/local/bin/fail2ban-client</code> - <code>DAEMON=/usr/local/bin/$NAME-client</code> <br>  - with <code>/usr/bin/fail2ban-client</code> - <code>DAEMON=/usr/bin/$NAME-client</code> <br>  Do not forget to check the autostart service (update-rc.d, rcconf, file-rc ... favorite substitute). <br></div></div>  [/ UPD] <br><br>  Now, in order for the new functionality to work, you need to add an option in your jail.local in [default] (or for each specific jail): <code>bantime.increment = true</code> .  An example and description can still be found in " <a href="">jail.conf</a> ". <br>  Some here are brief: <br><ul><li>  <code>bantime.rndtime</code> is the maximum time used to add random time to <code>banTime</code> to prevent smart botnets from calculating the exact time when the IP is unlocked again.  Example <code>bantime.rndtime = 10m</code> </li><li>  <code>bantime.factor</code> - coefficient for calculating the growth exponent for the formula <code>bantime.formula</code> or multipliers <code>bantime.multipliers</code> , the default value of the coefficient is 1, which corresponds to an increase in the ban time for 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 ... By increasing this parameter for some jail, increase blocking time more aggressively. </li><li>  <code>bantime.formula</code> - used by default to calculate the next value of the ban time, the default value: <code>bantime.formula = ban.Time * (1&lt;&lt;(ban.Count if ban.Count&lt;20 else 20)) * banFactor</code> <br>  The same increase in the ban time will be achieved using the factors <code>bantime.multipliers</code> equal to 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 ... <br>  An example of a more aggressive formula for factor "1" and has the same growth values ‚Äã‚Äãonly for a factor equal to "2.0 / 2.885385": <br> <code>bantime.formula = ban.Time * math.exp(float(ban.Count+1)*banFactor)/math.exp(1*banFactor)</code> <br> </li><li>  <code>bantime.multipliers</code> - the parameter can be used instead of the formula discretely to calculate the next value of the time of the ban.  The value of the multiplier is "-1" (can only be at the end of the list) and puts the address in a permanent ban (before manual unlocking). <br>  Example 1: <code>bantime.multipliers = 1 2 4 8 16 32 64</code> - increases the ban time by 1, 2, 4, ... and if the last ban count was more than the last multiplier index, the last multiplier will always be used (64 in the example), which with a factor equal to "1" and the original time of the ban (10 minutes) - corresponds to 10.6 hours. <br>  Example 2: <code>bantime.multipliers = 1 5 30 60 300 720 1440 2880</code> - can be used for a small initial ban time (bantime = 60) - because  the increase becomes more aggressive, we have bantime equal: 1 min, 5 min, 30 min, 1 hour, 5 hours, 12 hours, 1 day, 2 days, respectively. </li></ul><br>  If during the trial or in production any (good) IP accidentally repeatedly flew to the ban (and became correspondingly bad), it will be forgotten (it will become ‚Äúwhite‚Äù again) itself after the three times last ban and dbpurgeage (located in fail2ban.local) , or if with his hands to remove the ban, using: <pre> <code class="bash hljs">fail2ban-client <span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">set</span></span> <span class="hljs-variable"><span class="hljs-variable">$JAIL</span></span> unbanip <span class="hljs-variable"><span class="hljs-variable">$IP</span></span></code> </pre> <br>  I use fail2ban-regex for testing regulars, and for the performance test something like this: <pre> <code class="bash hljs">logger -t <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">'test:auth'</span></span> -i -p auth.info <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"pam_unix(test:auth): authentication failure; logname= uid=0 euid=0 tty=test ruser=admin rhost=1.2.3.4"</span></span></code> </pre><br>  Do not forget about the start: <br><pre> <code class="bash hljs">sudo service fail2ban start</code> </pre><br>  That's all, now I hope your server has become a little more secure.  Well, you do not be lazy and look all the same in the logs (trust, but verify). <br><br>  PS Standard postscript: WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY.  In short - use on health, but at your own peril and risk ... <br>  And may your servers be safe. <br><br>  PPS Yes, I almost forgot, I have something planned here to finish something, something is already ready, you just need to arrange it normally and post it, and so - the poll ‚ÄúWhat do you have to do (before) in the first place‚Äù. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/238303/">https://habr.com/ru/post/238303/</a></p>
