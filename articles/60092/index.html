After each change, of course, <br>  run all the tests. <br><br>  Two design patterns were named: ‚Äúfaked‚Äù and ‚Äúobvious implementation‚Äù, often used in TDD.

      After that there was a report ‚ÄúTraining of software engineers (experience of stolen)‚Äù. <br>  The report described the changes in the program and structure of education that are designed to ensure <br>  Ukrainian IT necessary professionals.  I must say that sounds reasonably reasonable, although <br>  there were skeptics. <br><br>  The following weaknesses in the training of specialists were noted: <br>  1. group dynamics and communication, roles in the project <br>  2. software engineering process <br>  3. quality assurance <br>  4. software engineering systems and tools <br><br>  I would refer everything except P4 to our IT education.  P4 I think is simply not necessary - means <br>  mastered along the way, if there is a theoretical base, it is very easy. <br><br>  It was told about the transition to a two-stage education (master and bachelor), and about specialties <br>  and about other official nonsense, which is interesting mainly to aunts and uncles from the ministry <br>  education.  I do not know who else.  Well, the teacher and the developer from the plow did not see much meaning in many important words. <br><br>  There was one interesting point - internships for IT teachers in leading companies, of course, large ones. <br>  There is an opportunity to hold such an internship for teachers of our department, <br>  although in a small version, in one of the oldest Minsk companies (not EPAM :). <br><br>  There was a report with a loud name "Application Integration".  Told about the transfer process <br>  customer on MS BizTalk Server.  The title of the report does not correspond at all, and about the problems <br>  application integration was not told at all. <br><br>  There was a very interesting and lively report on MediaWiki - an open system on which wikipedia is written. <br>  They even gave a free flash drive with it.  What is on the flash drive, while not looking. <br>  The system is really interesting, using the case for documenting the project. <br>  And the interesting phrase ‚ÄúCommunication is not information‚Äù was uttered, <br>  who walked through my corns - for some time I had the stupidity of working in an organization, <br>  where ICQ logs were the only project documentation. <br><br>  The report "Automation of enterprise project management processes."  Ha, changed the schedule and <br>  There was another report about the .NET implementation of solving a specific XML problem.  Fe to the organizers. <br><br>  Then I missed a couple of reports, and only came to "Organizing the application design process <br>  in a software company. "  The report, in principle, is not bad, but it does not correspond to the title.  About <br>  interfaces, usability and user experince.  Liked the division of professionalism: <br>  1. Newbie <br>  2. Master <br>  3. A man with his own style of work. <br>  Such of p3 are moving the industry, or at least just prominent personalities, like that. <br>  It was said about the organization of interaction on the project, about the role of designers and other brethren, <br>  which I do not pay special attention. <br><br>  Report "Typical problems of identifying requirements and their solution."  Good report. <br>  1. The gap between the Analyst and the Customer <br>  2. "Yes, but ..." syndrome <br>  3.  does not know what she wants <br>  4. No access to W <br>  5. W and protect each other <br>  6. No W <br>  7. No documentation <br>  8. Changing Requirements <br>  9. Undiscovered requirements <br>  10. Distributed team <br>  11. No need for anything. <br>  12. Leadership drives ahead <br>  13. Many W eats <br><br>  This is how it is.  Solutions were shown, and problem-solving techniques.  The speaker is a member of <a href="http://uml2.ru/">uml2.ru.</a> <br><br>  The latest report is ‚ÄúAnalyst in Agile‚Äù.  About analyst's prol in Agile, about what he <br>  can do and how to help the team, about its interaction with the Product Owner and so on. <br>  Interesting and lively. <br><br>  All reports will be published, perhaps, and the video will be.  Only where it is not clear. <br><br>  I won't go to SEF tomorrow.  I will go to "Sun Open Network Systems: strategies and resources of the new time." <br><br>  Do not kick much for an inaccurate code, it's time to sleep, and get up early - you have to take the exam in the morning. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/60092/">https://habr.com/ru/post/60092/</a></p>
