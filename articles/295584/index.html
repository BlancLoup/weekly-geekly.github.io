In this article I will try to briefly review each method of applying presentations from different points of view on this concept. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><ol><li>  <b>Presentation as an offer.</b> <br><br>  One of the most common types of presentations, because it allows a company to directly make a profit.  This may be a personal offer addressed to a particular customer or a fairly general description of the company's main goods / services intended for a wide audience.  The main purpose of this presentation is sales.

      Slides are usually created for screen reading rather than speaking to an audience and distributed by mail or laid out on different platforms for viewing presentations (for example, SlideShare) to simplify access to materials.  The content of such presentations usually includes a description of the company's core services, a personal offer (if the presentation is made for a particular client), the benefits of working with this company and a call to action.  When dealing with cold sales or mass segments, the main problem that potential buyers face and its solution can be described. <br><br></li><li>  <b>Presentation of the project to investors, accelerators or partners.</b> <br><br>  Such a presentation, as a rule, contains information about the company's services, but the focus is on various internal indicators.  This may be information about the market, target audience, sales channels, the team and many other things that will be interesting for a potential business partner.  The purpose of such presentations can also be called a sale, but not the services / goods (as in the first case), but the company itself.  The result of such work should be the desire to cooperate with this company, invest in it or buy it. <br><br>  The format of such interaction with investors, accelerators or partners usually involves several stages.  For the first contact, more detailed slides can be used, which imply independent study of materials and making decisions about further work with the company.  In case of successful completion of the first stage, the presentation can be reworked specifically for a personal meeting, where it will already play a supporting role for the person speaking with it. <br><br></li><li>  <b>Presentation within the company.</b> <br><br>  This type is most often used in large companies to report on the work done before superiors or approve new projects.  All presentation parameters (time and format of the presentation, slide design, etc.) must comply with the approved standards and templates.  In such presentations, a large number of numbers, tables and graphs are often used, which contributes to cluttering up slides.  It is very important to highlight the main idea, to make it simple and understandable. <br><br></li><li>  <b>Presentation of the work done to the client.</b> <br><br>  This type of presentation is very similar to the previous one, but provides more opportunities for self-realization, due to the absence of such strict frameworks and rules.  The format of such presentations can be any, but usually is a speech to a small audience using slides that play a supporting role.  The main goal is the same - simply and clearly show the volume results of the company.  Any visualization of data, from simple graphs to complex infographics, is perfect for this purpose. <br><br></li><li>  <b>Useful materials for potential customers.</b> <br><br>  This type includes any presentations at conferences and seminars, where company representatives share their experience and knowledge, as well as various research and training materials.  Such works usually contain references to the company's activities in order to increase brand awareness and create an image of an expert in this field.  The main criterion for such works is the usefulness of the content for viewers or readers.  The presence of unique content allows the company to achieve its goals, get new customers and partners. <br></li></ol><br>  There are several other ways to apply elements of presentations in the company, it can be various cards, calendars, sites in the format of presentations and much more.  Borders of application of this tool are limited only to imagination of the person who is engaged in it.  In this article I reviewed only the main types of such presentations, which, based on the experience of our studio, are used more often than others.  This is the first article in our blog, so it describes only the general characteristics of these species.  In the following articles we will definitely consider them in detail, based on your comments and suggestions. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/295584/">https://habr.com/ru/post/295584/</a></p>
