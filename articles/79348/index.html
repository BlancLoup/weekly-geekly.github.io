    <a name="habracut"></a>  Currently, the e-commerce market is experiencing an unprecedented rise.  The number of proposals for certain categories of goods is striking in its diversity. <br><br>  But, if you think about it, we, opening our online store, in most cases are going to sell almost (or absolutely) the same thing as our competitors, but absolutely (or almost) at the same price ... It is in this situation that the skill to notice important little things may be key in the competition for the buyer. <br><br>  Many owners of online stores, trying to attract the attention of potential buyers and distinguish themselves among competitors, rely on the loyalty program - they make discounts to regular customers, organize all sorts of promotions and hold contests with prizes.  Of course, this is an important point in attracting visitors, buyers like to buy goods at a discount and receive gifts. <br><br>  In pursuit of originality of the offer, many online stores absolutely forget about the more important, in our opinion, things: careful attention to the buyer, speed and quality of work, quality of the goods.  But it is precisely these factors that are crucial for creating the reputation of an online store and a good attitude of potential buyers. <br><br>  Now, in fact, let us tell about the very "little things" about which the owners of many online stores forget, with the result that their potential buyers go to more competent competitors: <br><br>  <b>1. Order processing speed</b> <br>  Most of the buyers, ordering goods in the online store, hopes for the fastest possible resolution of their issue.  The optimal response time for an online order is 10-15 minutes.  But, in fact, the faster you respond to the received order, the better the impression from the purchase in your online store will remain with the buyer. <br><br>  <b>2. Communication with the buyer</b> <br>  On this issue, you can select a few simple rules, following which you can significantly position a potential buyer to your online store: <br><br>  - Start a conversation. <br>  A conversation with a potential buyer on the phone should always begin with the words "Hello,% name of online store%".  Alternatively, you can use the greeting by the time of day ("Good morning / afternoon / evening ...").  The main thing to remember is that in no case should you start a conversation with the words ‚ÄúHello‚Äù, ‚ÄúYes‚Äù, ‚ÄúListening‚Äù, etc. <br><br>  - Brevity is the soul of wit. <br>  The ability to briefly, and most importantly, understandable to the interlocutor, to present all the information about the requested product is one of the most important qualities of a good manager. <br><br>  - "Smile gloomy day brighter." <br>  Smile while talking to a customer on the phone.  Your voice should always sound confident, cheerful and fun.  In a telephone conversation, the interlocutor feels a positive touch in the manager‚Äôs intonation, and he adjusts himself to a more positive mood. <br><br>  - Helping people is your primary concern. <br>  Help the customer.  Find out what goals the customer pursues by purchasing this particular product.  Perhaps his choice does not match the goals.  Your task is to explain why you should not buy this product, but rather take another (perhaps even more profitable for the price). <br><br>  - ‚ÄúTell me how it works?‚Äù <br>  Increase the overall competence of sellers in all matters related to the product and the operation of the online store as a whole.  Remember, the level of knowledge of one seller is one of the main indicators of the level of the entire company. <br><br>  <b>3. Quality delivery</b> <br>  Courier delivery - one of the most delicate moments of the online store.  I even think that this topic deserves a separate topic in the corresponding blog.  But to designate several abstracts on the topic of courier delivery is still worth it: <br><br>  - Fast delivery is not the main thing.  The main thing - to deliver on time. <br>  In my opinion, I even saw a similar slogan in one of the online stores in St. Petersburg.  If the buyer ordered delivery at 12:00, then the courier must be in place at 11:55. <br><br>  - Train your couriers. <br>  Appearance, good manners and knowledge of the characteristics of the goods for the courier are very important.  The client will undoubtedly be pleased to receive the desired thing from the hands of a neatly dressed person who will always be able to answer in an accessible way any of their questions related to the goods. <br><br>  <b>4. Force Majeure</b> <br>  If due to the fault of the online store there are significant deviations from the original agreement with the buyer, be sure to inform him about it.  Believe me, it will be much better if the buyer finds out about unexpected circumstances from you, rather than face him alone.  In addition, many people who have already made an order in this online store are ready to make small concessions in favor of the seller. <br><br>  <b>5. Feedback from the buyer</b> <br>  The buyer will have a good impression of your online store, if after a while after receiving your order, you call him and ask if he is satisfied with the purchase and service in your online store.  You can accept any comments or suggestions.  The buyer, for sure, will be satisfied that the owners of the online store are worried about their customers. <br><br>  It should be noted that all these rules will never bring results if the employees of your online store do not want to do their job 100%.  Remember that the motivation of your employees is the key to quality work and the development of the entire company. <br><br>  In conclusion, the topic I want to say the following.  Nowadays, all successful large companies keep in touch with their customers through large-scale promotions and beautiful voices of support service girls.  The success of small and medium businesses directly depends on the relationship between customers and sellers.  Therefore, when opening your own online store, you should always rely, first of all, on the quality of the goods and convenience of service for customers.  And you will be happy in the form of the number of orders and the number of grateful buyers :) <br><br>  The main thing to remember - the little things decide everything ... :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/79348/">https://habr.com/ru/post/79348/</a></p>
