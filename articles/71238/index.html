And I still can not break through all these tax, legal entities, business plans, negotiations with partners and investors, sales organization, unit testing and GAE features.  But here, meet, we released the next version of Web Optimizer ‚Äúsailfish‚Äù ( <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D1%2583%25D1%2581%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA_(%25D1%2580%25D1%258B%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B0)" rel="nofollow">speed up to 110 km / h</a> ): more, more powerful, more reliable. <br><br>  Web Optimizer - an application to automatically accelerate sites.  Download: <br>  <a href="http://code.google.com/p/web-optimizator/downloads/list">code.google.com/p/web-optimizator/downloads/list</a> <br>  Read about Web Optimizer <br>  <a href="http://www.web-optimizer.ru/">www.web-optimizer.ru</a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  What's new </h3><br><ul><li>  <strong>Separation into paid and free versions</strong> .  Yes, the most discussed "improvement" :) Let me clarify the situation a little: <ul><li>  <strong>The authors have completed the development and decided to cut the dough?</strong>  Far from it.  The current monetization is an old and planned step (for we have no means of developing a product for several years, as I went to vkontakte before starting to turn banners) to improve the quality of the product.  Look at the majority of free open source utilities: almost all of them are developing (if they are developing at all) extremely depressing.  One new feature can be added for months.  We do not want such an outcome, we want to make our product much better than it is now.  And do it in a short time.  But for this you need at least ten times more time than you already spent on it.  And we will invest this time, but without financial support this cannot be done.  Therefore, we focus on the market and are looking for support in it. </li><li> <strong>Why are there so few features in the free version?</strong>  We analyzed thousands of real product installations and selected the most efficient parts (on the one hand) and the most difficult configurable and problematic (on the other).  Naturally, we left all the first group and bring the second to the paid version.  The free version is now the best of all its free counterparts (due to a carefully crafted file merge algorithm, compression logic, caching logic, and a set of rules for <code>.htaccess</code> ).  In fact, we have secured most of the users from themselves and left the maximum acceleration for professionals. </li><li>  <strong>No more innovations?</strong>  We have very far-reaching plans for creating an integrated tool to speed up websites ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/webdev/70880/">some of them have already been announced</a> ): this includes competent server-side caching processing at all levels, maximum improvement of file processing algorithms, and a set of profiling tools ( <a href="http://webo.in/">webo.in</a> functionality) and a set of tools for "manual" optimization, and using the advantages of <a href="http://clubs.ya.ru/yacf/">quick layout</a> , and much more.  We are not going to rest on our laurels, we just laid some foundation for future productive work. </li></ul></li><li>  Okay, back to the new opportunities.  Now Web Optimizer is available as a plugin for Wordpress, Joomla!  1.5, Joomla!  1.0.  We are working on integration in Drupal and Bitrix.  All plugins work the same way: they wrap the Web Optimizer functionality into system calls and interfaces. </li><li>  Improved compression.  The gzip, x-gzip, deflate and x-deflate methods are now fully supported.  In addition, a correct separation was made at the HTML caching level for all these types, which significantly increased the reliability of the product. </li><li>  Improved caching of static resources.  Now CSS and JavaScript files can be written without additional GET parameters (necessary for correct flushing of the cache).  Thus, the cache of proxying servers gets clogged up faster, and even less traffic leaves the server. </li><li>  Many improvements in the logic of CSS Sprites.  In particular, the algorithm for integrating images from <a href="http://spriteme.org/">SpriteMe was integrated</a> , which resulted in a smaller size of the final files.  Also improved algorithm for translucent images for compatibility with weak servers. </li><li>  Improved style merging algorithm.  Now they "break" (if at all this happens) in units of cases out of tens of thousands. </li><li>  Added Server Configuration tab (on the main page).  Now you can check all the features of the system without additional analysis of the settings and the result of their application. </li><li>  Improved accessibility and ease of use of the graphical interface (a large number of small innovations, some of which delivered two sleepless nights in a row). </li><li>  Improved unobtrusive JavaScript conversion.  Now supports more counters and ads. </li><li>  The number of external integration features of Web Optimizer technology has been increased.  Now you can simply send the HTML code for optimization and get the result at the output.  <a href="http://code.google.com/p/web-optimizator/wiki/Integration%3Fwl%3Dru">Read more in the wiki</a> . </li><li>  Improved compatibility with HTML / XHTML / XML documents (we don‚Äôt add <code>xml:lang</code> to the first, <code>xml:lang</code> to the second, and skip the third). </li><li>  Added German and Spanish localization, now Web Optimizer is already in five languages, still Russian, English and Ukrainian. </li><li>  Added a bunch of CMS to the list of supported: <br><ul><li>  ExpressionEngine </li><li>  Open slaed </li><li>  Website baker </li><li>  XOOPS </li><li>  Xayara </li><li>  osCommerce </li><li>  MaxDev Pro </li><li>  4images </li></ul><br></li><li>  Yes, the site is <a href="http://web-optimizer.ru/">completely dedicated to the product</a> .  There are many materials in Russian (previously, almost all of this was only in English). </li></ul><br><br><h3>  What's next </h3><br>  You can absolutely free to download the product here. <br>  <a href="http://code.google.com/p/web-optimizator/downloads/list">code.google.com/p/web-optimizator/downloads/list</a> <br>  As I said, the demo version provides very great functionality, for ordinary sites it is more than enough.  If you want to speed up your website professionally, you <a href="http://www.web-optimizer.ru/web-optimizer/buy-now.html">can send a request</a> .  We are always glad to cooperate.

      For developers (who are going to implement Web Optimizer for their clients' projects) special conditions apply.  Please <a href="http://www.web-optimizer.ru/web-optimizer/buy-now.html">contact us</a> if you are interested. <br><br><h3>  Plans for the near future </h3><br>  The current interface will definitely be reworked (it has outlived itself and requires a cardinal replacement, we think about it :), the caching at the server level has been improved, the documentation has been reassembled (otherwise it is in a somewhat chaotic state) and a debug-branch has been compiled (for full debugging of the application, but sometimes it is not enough).  Most likely, a couple of dozen improvements requested by the community. <br><br><h3>  Some statistics </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d1d/06e/0cd/d1d06e0cd055ee408b77683723127a37.png" alt="Web Optimizer Downloads"><br>  This is the current situation with the distribution of the product.  It is clearly seen that in September we grew by 60% compared to the previous 6 months.  And we are going to maintain such a pace. <br><br><h3>  Finally </h3><br>  We work every day to make your sites better and faster.  We are debugging various algorithms, conducting load testing, applying the best practices from around the world and are not going to stop.  And at the same time, all that we ask is the acceptance of the fact that a high-quality and successful innovative web application can be created in Russia. <br><br>  Download Web Optimizer <br>  <a href="http://code.google.com/p/web-optimizator/downloads/list">code.google.com/p/web-optimizator/downloads/list</a> <br>  Read about Web Optimizer more <br>  <a href="http://www.web-optimizer.ru/">www.web-optimizer.ru</a> <br>  Twitter feed: <a href="http://twitter.com/wboptimizer">twitter.com/wboptimizer</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/71238/">https://habr.com/ru/post/71238/</a></p>
