As a first stage, the SLS booster from the launch pad gives the initial impulse to the spacecraft, taking it out of the atmosphere.  To launch rockets, SLS will have 8-9 million pounds of thrust. <br><br>  Right now, SLS can lift 70 tons into space, but ultimately will be able to lift 130 tons.  This is important for a long-term mission that can take several months.  ‚ÄúWhen we fly to the moon, we don‚Äôt need heavy rockets,‚Äù says Bolden.  "But we need significantly more weight [for traveling to an asteroid or Mars]." <br><br>  Why does 3D printing help SLS?  It turns out that lightweight plastic components handle the stress of high launch speed better than some heavy welded materials. <br><br>  While Mars is still a distant future for SLS, asteroids are most likely in the first place.  One of the advantages of this rocket is the ability to reach the Earth-threatening asteroids before it is too late.  This task became even more urgent after last week the meteorite in Russia became a surprise, and then the asteroid passing too close to the Earth. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe further you intercept the asteroid, the less effort you will have to drop it from a dangerous orbit,‚Äù indicates Bolden.  "If we can detect and characterize an asteroid, we can get to it faster, and there will be less work to change its path." <br><br>  How would NASA stop an asteroid from crashing into the Earth?  Although there have been proposals for the use of nuclear warheads, Bolden does not agree with this strategy, saying that it will create more small asteroids.  Instead, he suggests pushing the asteroid off a dangerous course. <br><br>  ‚ÄúAll we know is that an asteroid has magnetic properties.  So if we can find a way to be near an asteroid, we can transport or push it away, ‚Äùhe says. <br><br>  Perhaps 3D printing one day will save planet Earth, but now this process satisfies more pressing needs: domestic production. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWhen the president highlighted manufacturing progress in his address to Congress, our ears were reddened,‚Äù says Bolden.  "We have been working on it for several years." <br><br><img title="Frank Ledbetter (right), Non-Metallic Production Manager, Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) NASA, discuss with Nancy Tolliver, an engineer, 3D partition printing, which is part of the main SLS engine - RS-25" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b37/67a/39c/b3767a39c894b5882fa88826a24b18c1.png"><br>  <i>Frank Ledbetter (right), Non-Metallic Production Manager, Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) NASA, discuss with Nancy Tolliver, an engineer, 3D partition printing, which is part of the main SLS engine - RS-25</i> <br><br>  Based on <a href="http://mashable.com/2013/02/22/nasa-3d-printed-rocket-parts/">Amanda Willis</a> and <a href="http://mashable.com/">mashable.com</a> <br>  Photo MSFC / Emmet <br><br>  Note <br>  In early November, I translated the article ‚Äú <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/157469/">Will Americans Fly to Mars - how does this depend on the results of the election of the President of the United States</a> ?‚Äù <br>  And right after the election <a href="http://mashable.com/2012/11/07/obama-nasa-asteroid/">, it was said</a> that plans to reach the asteroid belt in 2025, and Mars in 2030 remain in place, and that NASA hopes that the SLS-Orion combo (Orion <a href="http://www.space.com/12942-photos-nasa-giant-rocket-space-launch-system.html">space launch system</a> ) will launch astronauts by the end of 2021.  Creating this rocket becomes a priority for the agency. <br>  NASA is focusing efforts in deep space, planning to deliver people and cargo into near-earth space to be fully serviced by American commercial space companies, the agency has spent $ 1.4 billion on the development of which over the past two years.  The agency has already signed contracts for the delivery of goods with the company SpaceX for 1.6 billion dollars, and the first Dragon have already delivered the cargo to the ISS and back.  In addition, the agency has signed a $ 1.9 billion contract with Orbital Sciences to make eight unmanned flights of the Antares rocket and the Cygnus spacecraft. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/170435/">https://habr.com/ru/post/170435/</a></p>
