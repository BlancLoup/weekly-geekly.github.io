I spend every morning under the ground at least 54 minutes - and the same in the evening.  It is easy to calculate that, recalculating my ‚Äúunderground‚Äù time into standard 40-hour weeks, I will receive (or rather lose) this year: <br><br>  ((54 minutes * 2 times a day) / 60 minutes per hour) * 5 times a week * ((365 days a year / 7 days a week) - 3 weeks of vacation) / 40 hours in a work week = 9 hours on the subway per week * 49 working weeks per year / 40 hours per working week = 11 working weeks or almost <b>3 working months</b> .

      Someone in the subway is trying to imitate a dream, someone is reading, listening to music (a year ago I did a small survey on this topic: <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/metro_life/119742.html">community.livejournal.com/metro_life/119742.html</a> ) ... Can I somehow use this ‚Äútrash ", Most wasted time with benefit?  The answer is yes. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Do not think, I am not a workaholic, ready to sculpt the code day and night.  I love to fully live, relax and have fun.  Previously, my time was divided, as in most of us, into 3 categories: working time, rest time (which constantly had to be sacrificed in favor of work) and ‚Äúgarbage‚Äù time.  The last category is the time that we lose in queues, transport, waiting for the bus or friends ... Usually they try to kill this time.  I managed to find a way to use it to complete the work.  And turning ‚Äúgarbage‚Äù time into working time - freeing up really valuable time for LIFE.  Now, in the evenings and on weekends, I have been busy with myself, family, friends, allowing myself the luxury of going on vacation (which I could not afford for 6 years until last year).  And at the same time, I‚Äôve got enough time to deal with the main tasks of the work, and conduct my own projects. <br><br>  How it all began ... <br><br>  Several years ago I had to constantly travel around Moscow and the Moscow region.  In order not to waste time, I took a laptop with me - a three-kilogram 15 ‚ÄùDell Latitude. programmers), conduct business correspondence, program. How I hated this coffin with a processor for 2 years of constant dragging on myself! Moreover, after an hour of work, it literally turned into a dead weight. And I began to look for something more compact  ie, that could cope with the challenges that I've done on the road. <br><br>  Soberly assessing my financial potential, I, holding back a tear, put an end to the newfangled platform "Origami", OQO and other full-fledged pocket PCs cost from 2-3 thousand dollars (let me remind you about 2006). <br><br>  I love Nokia for a long time and not without reason.  I had Siemens and Samsung, so I had something to compare with.  So, I decided to take a Finnish smartphone, and not exotic models of the 80th and 90th series, but the most common one - the 60th.  I was going to use the phone for working with texts (and server script texts as well), while I had to work from time to time in places that were not the most suitable for this, and I limited the budget for the purchase to 15t.r., so I had to choose between these models: 7710, E70 and E61.  The choice was painful.  On the one hand - a luxurious, not on the phone, a huge screen 7710, on the other hand - compactness and a QWERTY-keyboard E61.  I had to hold back the big and beautiful, to make myself think pragmatically.  Judging by the reviews that I read on the Internet, the 7710 is the latest model of the 90th series, which Nokia, according to the same reviews found, is discontinuing.  Nevertheless, the E61 fits better with the size of my handbag, being neatly placed in one of the pockets, and even in a subway car, train or on the street, such a machine will attract much less unhealthy attention than the E70 in the unfolded form.  For the last two years, it was in such places that I had to use a laptop from time to time (time trouble! I am going to hand over the project, and I have to finish the project on the road!).  Although fatal incidents did not happen, but unhealthy attention from all sorts of crumpled subjects ("Girl! ... ik ... Do you like working like this? Let's go have a better drink!") - to my lot abound. <br><br>  So, I chose the Nokia E61. <br><br>  At first, the miniature qwerty-keyboard of the smartphone seemed to me totally unsuitable for work - and I bought a wireless bluetooth-keyboard Nokia SU-8W for more comfortable printing.  To my surprise, I rather quickly got used to the smartphone keyboard - and the blue-tooth folding miracle has been collecting dust for about 2 years in the drawer. <br><br>  Using a smartphone on the road, I was able not only to edit very voluminous texts, communicate with customers and developers, but also administer my web servers, test our programs for mobile.  Moreover, working with text on a smartphone turned out to be quite convenient so that you could write articles for dozens of kilobytes on it, work along the road between the house and the office, standing at rush hour on the subway, waiting for the bus at one o'clock in the desert, standing in line in a supermarket - where I couldn‚Äôt have been able to risk a laptop ... In general, I received not 108 daily minutes, but at least three hours. <br><br>  I will give a list of programs for the Nokia E61, which seemed to me the most convenient for work: <br><br>  <a href="http://www.lonelycatgames.com/%3Fapp%3Dxplore">X-plore</a> <br>  File manager with many additional features - working with zip / jar-archives, viewing files in various encodings, sending files via Bluetooth, working with attachments sent in messages. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.jbak.ru/">Dedit</a> <br>  Definitely the best of mobile text editors - from a programmer's point of view.  It allows you to work comfortably with large source files (in different encodings), to keep several windows with files open at the same time - and other standard text editors that are missing in mobile under-editors: navigating by line number, search / replace, etc.  No syntax highlighting - but this is a delight. <br><br>  <a href="http://s2putty.sourceforge.net/download.html">PuTTY</a> <br>  This program needs no introduction.  We work through GPRS over SSH on remote servers.  The minus of the mobile version is that the file transfer is not implemented, so it‚Äôs worth having a program like <br><br>  <a href="http://www.bermin.net/mobyexplorer.html">MobyExplorer</a> <br>  This is a globular FTP client.  If after the end of the trial 15-day period to demolish this program and install it again - we get the next 15 days of the trial.  But it is more correct to pay the author. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.opera.com/mini/">Opera Mini</a> <br>  Good browser.  With its glitches, but allows at times to reduce not the cheapest GPRS-traffic when surfing the web. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.opera.com/mobile/">Opera Mobile</a> <br>  It seems to be - what is the need for Opera Mobile with Opera Mini and a pre-installed browser?  But Opera Mobile was the only product able to open local HTML files.  No, I did not do the HTML layout on the smartphone.  But the J2ME documentation is just a collection of HTML files. <br><br>  <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pys60">Python for Series 60</a> <br>  Allows you to write python programs directly on your smartphone.  True, a mobile python is an incomplete subset of the ‚ÄúBig Python‚Äù, but it is a very real tool that allows you to literally ‚Äúwrite‚Äù the necessary utility ‚Äúon the go‚Äù whether it is backing up telephone information, communicating with a computer via bluetooth ... <br><br>  <a href="http://www.mobi-systems.com/">Officesuite</a> <br>  It is a worthy editor (and not just a viewer!) Doc-files.  But - paid. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.jimm.org/">Jimm</a> <br>  ICQ client. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.talkonaut.ru/">Talkonaut</a> <br>  Jabber client <br><br>  <a href="http://www.fring.com/fring_is/what_is_fring/">Fring</a> <br>  Allows you to communicate in networks Skype, MSN Messenger, Google Talk, ICQ, SIP, Twitter, Yahoo !, AIM. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.mbrainsoftware.com/S60_3rd/Pdf/Pdf.htm">PDF +</a> <br>  The pdf viewer is much more stable than Adobe Reader LE.  True, the trial version has many annoying restrictions.  And for more or less acceptable work with the documentation, I bought myself this program. <br><br>  <a href="http://symbianon.com/page/Security3rd.html">Securitygenius</a> <br>  This watchdog program checks each time the smartphone starts, whether the SIM card has been changed in it.  If there has been a SIM card replacement, the phone starts sending SMS text messages to the numbers you specified in advance - and it‚Äôs easy to find out who your device is from now. <br><br>  Well, for fun - <a href="http://www.lonelycatgames.com/%3Fapp%3Dsmartmovie">SmartMovie</a> <br>  Having bought N-Gage once, I tried to watch a video in it.  The initial delight of the ‚Äúcinema in your pocket‚Äù was replaced by disappointment: the video on the screen with a resolution of 176x208 created the feeling that 70 percent of the pleasure of the film passes by me - as if I were watching a movie through a keyhole.  My first phone video experience ended with an absolutely clear feeling that a mobile video player is nothing more than a means to demonstrate the coolness of a smartphone: ‚Äúbut my mobile is still able!‚Äù Watching movies on the phone is not intended to impress friends or neighbors car subway, namely, in order to watch the movie - it is meaningless.  When I bought the Nokia E61, I decided to try to launch a film on it - just to be convinced of the capabilities of my phone and once again state that the video on the mobile is nothing more than a high-tech rattle for teens of all ages.  I'm glad to note that I was wrong.  The popular expression ‚Äúsize matters‚Äù in the case of mobile video works ‚Äúone hundred percent‚Äù.  The resolution of 320x240 pixels exceeds the resolution of the computer screen when watching movies about 15 years ago - we also watched movies on the screen 320 * 200 (256 colors) and enjoyed it!  And the size of the screen of the Nokia E61 is over the edge beyond which the show ends and the movie begins :) In any case, I did not regret $ 25 for the official version of the program, which I liked. <br><br>  But the smart could not completely replace my laptop on the road.  Having tested my j2me-program and found bugs, I could not immediately, without delay, deal with the correction of errors.  I spent a year unsuccessfully searching for a java-compiler that could work under Symbian, tried to port javac, write the byte-code compiler myself, tried to make a translator from python to java ... The only option that worked was a compilation on a remote server.  But this is the second part of the article ... <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/53010/">https://habr.com/ru/post/53010/</a></p>
