The view of the marketer on the features of the currently popular types of communication on the Internet is interesting for me, because I, as a developer, simply ignore some obvious things.

      score: 4 <br><br>  <strong>JavaScript and accessibility of web applications (Vladimir Agafonkin)</strong> <strong><br></strong> <br>  An interesting topic about how to implement web projects that are available not only to the modern browser.  The author has well classified the main problems, and ways to solve them.  In my opinion, not all of them are very easy to release, but if the project really requires it, or the developer knows that it is really ‚Äúaccessible‚Äù to do any part of the functionality, without making much effort, then why not try it.  Also, after the report, I wanted to touch the sites of large and popular companies for such things (for example, apple.com :) <br><br>  score: 5 <br><br>  <strong>Layout independent blocks (Vitaly Kharisov)</strong> <strong><br></strong> <br>  A report on how a large company (Yandex) in the implementation of large projects seeks to increase the reuse of not only software components, but also presentations.  Agreement, the development of rules for creating HTML-representation pays off with a vengeance, making it flexible and more understandable (for team members). <br><br>  score: 5 <br><br>  <strong>Comfortable site development on XSL (Nadezhda Strohankova)</strong> <strong><br></strong> <br>  A good overview and recommendations of the correct use of XSL as a template engine. <br><br>  score: 5 <br><br>  <strong>Using GWT to build Web 2.0 (Valentin Shibanov)</strong> <strong><br></strong> <br>  Review of powerful technology from Google.  The author has well classified all the advantages that a developer gets using GWT.  It is pleasant to listen to a person who really loves what he is talking about :) <br><br>  score: 5 <br><br>  <strong>Request - answer?</strong>  <strong>This is not our method!</strong>  <strong>(Alexander Kostyuchenko)</strong> <strong><br></strong> <br>  A good overview of the methods and techniques when the client part of the web application requires (in view of greater efficiency) a permanent connection to the server part.  The data are well broken down by the methods of implementation, the features of cross-platform and relevance are indicated (which is already outdated, what is new in the latest releases of modern browsers). <br><br>  score: 5 <br><br>  <strong>Web development on django (Ilya Hamushkin)</strong> <strong><br></strong> <br>  An example of using a very popular framework for developing web applications.  And not only django is interesting, but also the python language.  There were no holivors (for 10 python programmers - 10 good ones, for 10 php - 2 :), but I, unfortunately, agree with the author.  For me, the report is a new energy charge in order to bring the project started on django to the first version. <br><br>  score: 5 <br><br>  <strong>Application Development with NetBeans (Andrey Rodionov)</strong> <strong><br></strong> <br>  More marketing report, but still quite interesting and useful.  An overview of Sun's solutions for developing web projects in all the most fashionable areas. <br><br>  score: 4 <br><br>  <strong>Optimization of complex RubyOnRails applications (Sergey Smetana)</strong> <strong><br></strong> <br>  Very powerful report.  I made it into the top three of the most interesting and useful.  He shows with a real-life example that a programmer can not only read tutorials and study technology, but also use a different view and squeeze out of it a lot more analysis of bottlenecks.  OpenSource is not a barrier, but a contributing concept (though sometimes in practice these are trivial corrections of other people's mistakes).  Based on the above examples, I think many about themselves once again all the same noted that ROR is still damp. <br><br>  Rating: 5+ <br><br>  <strong>Data replication in PostgreSQL (Alexey Klyukin)</strong> <strong><br></strong> <br>  A fairly complete and accurate report (as far as time allotted allows it) about the PostgreSQL DBMS.  I have not had enough time to work with this product, so I learned a lot of interesting things for myself.  Donated for his part of the dinner :) <br><br>  score: 5 <br><br>  <strong>Usability testing in real environment (Paul Gokin)</strong> <strong><br></strong> <br>  I really liked the report.  Describes usability testing tools, practical examples, as well as the types of recommendations for improvement. <br><br>  Rating: 5+ <br><br>  <strong>Testing Vulnerabilities of Websites and Web Applications (Alla Kuchmar and Yuri Kozlov)</strong> <strong><br></strong> <br>  The faster the web and the number of applications develop, the more vulnerable they are.  Statistical data, a review of utilities and examples of their use for auditing web applications were given. <br><br>  score: 4 <br><br>  <strong>Raising capital in Start-Up (Yuriy Boyko)</strong> <strong><br></strong> <br>  Excellent educational program on the topic.  I liked the presentation of the material by the author, as well as the answers to the many and varied questions of the participants of the conference. <br><br>  Rating: 5+ <br><br>  In conclusion, I wanted to thank the organizers for organizing and holding the conference.  It is very useful when there is an opportunity to learn about many promising and powerful technologies with which I am familiar, but not used in practice. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/22567/">https://habr.com/ru/post/22567/</a></p>
