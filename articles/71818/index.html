  <section class="page js-page"><h1>I resent. Utel (Russia, Ural Regional Operator) - kidalovo!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good day, community! <br><br>  In this topic, I want to tell you how a large regional wired communication operator (and cellular communication too, but in this topic I‚Äôll tell you about their wired communication segment) throws its subscribers.  Many subscribers Yutela this topic is close.  I myself have been a subscriber of this operator for three years.  I also had problems of a technical plan and a financial one, but everything was always solved fairly quickly. <br>  Now I have left Utel, but I cannot not write on this subject - after the lawlessness that is happening now. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>The first story.</b> <br>  It all started a couple of months ago.  At our enterprise (rather large industrial enterprise) posted ads.  The essence of the ads is as follows: employees of the enterprise are invited to connect to the Internet (ADSL) at a corporate rate (namely, 300 rubles per month, unlimited, 1 megabit).  Many figured and connected.

      Thunder struck out of the blue when one of my employees, going into her personal account, found a negative balance.  The first thing I thought was that it was just a misunderstanding.  Phoned to other colleagues, she found out that they had the same situation.  Then there was a call to the TP provider, where they were told that they were not corporate clients, that there was no such tariff at all. <br><br>  Given the size of the enterprise, I can only guess how many people suddenly turned from corporate customers into throwing. <br><br>  <b>Second story</b> <br>  The second story is even cooler.  The actor is my employee.  He connected before this story with under-corporate tariffs, at a more expensive and faster rate.  Honestly paid all the payments, sometimes experienced problems that were solved the same way as I did, rather quickly. <br>  In August, the Internet suddenly stopped working for him.  The call to the TP revealed that the balance was somehow negative.  There were fights, swearing, in the end, TP apologized for the shoals in billing, offered to deposit money to the account, so that the Internet could start working now and write an application for recalculation, so that the incorrectly debited funds could be returned.  So did.  A few days have passed.  Internet has not earned.  Again the call to the TP, and again a negative balance.  Let me remind you that at this moment the monthly fee was already paid in double amount.  Again, swearing, again disassembly, again an apology from the TP and a proposal to deposit more funds into the account.  So I would stop at this place and go to court.  The person urgently needed an Internet and he again made money in the hope that now everything will work out.  Naive. <br>  As a result, after the next wait, the person never got the Internet.  The balance remained in the red.  And the next time they called the TP, they said something like the following: they were refused recalculation, and we generally hear for the first time that you are contacting us with this problem.  Like this. <br><br>  How this story ends, time will tell.  The subscriber, who has all the receipts on hand, went to court.  I am sure that many of the "corporate clients" will do the same, or at least the crowd terminated the contracts. <br><br>  I would like to ask a question to the official representatives of the office.  What's happening?  What is it?  General insanity employees?  Hard kidalovo?  On off.sayte even have a page where you can allegedly ask a question.  That's just the moderators work fine, and for the remaining questions the management of the office answers in the following ratio: 2 answers to 20 questions. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/71818/">https://habr.com/ru/post/71818/</a></p>
