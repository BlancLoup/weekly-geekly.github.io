      <strong>How to avoid self-motivation</strong> <br>  The best way to motivate yourself is to arrange your life so that it does not have to be done.  If your work for you is a constant struggle, it's time to think about a new job.  The idea is that techniques of explicit motivation should be used only as an aid, and not everywhere. <br><br>  Here are a few things that more naturally help in the workflow: <br><br>  <strong>Zeal.</strong>  Do things for which you have a real zeal.  We all sometimes have to do what we don't want to do.  But if life turns into an endless series of boring exercises, then this problem must be solved. <br><br>  <strong>Habits</strong>  All your business can not be trusted autopilot.  But I found that if you take a few main habits and put them in their place in the daily routine, it will become more orderly and productive.  If you wake up at the same time, work at the same time and perform similar actions while working, the next day will be much easier. <br><br>  <strong>Concentration.</strong>  Concentration is a state in which your thoughts are fully focused on the current task.  Although there are a lot of factors creating such a state, the most important role is played by the factor of correct awareness of the complexity of the current task.  Find ways to optimize your activities so that all tasks are at this optimal point between boredom and irritated concern. <br><br>  <strong>Motivation tips</strong> <br><br>  Contrary to all your efforts, zeal, habits and creating a better environment for concentration, they may not help.  Then it's time to find out which of the emotional accelerators you need to use to get to work.  Here are some of them: <br><br>  <strong>1. Return to finding out the reason</strong> - Concentration on an unnecessary task will not make it more valuable and attractive.  But to be distracted and ask yourself why, in general, you are doing this, in the end - definitely worth it.  If you can't figure out the reason, it‚Äôs probably not worth doing it at all from the very beginning. <br><br>  <strong>2. Make it five</strong> - Start working for 5 minutes.  Usually this little push is enough to continue more efficiently. <br><br>  <strong>3. Move</strong> - You can simply make your body move, as if you are really strongly motivated and you are trying to do everything.  This "deceitful" feint is possible and looks and sounds silly, but it works for sure. <br><br>  <strong>4. Find the next step</strong> - It is impossible to work on the entire project at once.  All that can be done is to focus directly on the next step.  Fighting the amorphous structure of the entire project as a whole will only cause a slowdown.  Divide him so that they can be controlled. <br><br>  <strong>5. Identify interference</strong> - What prevents you from working?  Do not let this continue its disastrous effect, isolate the interference and get rid of this problem.  You have no motivation because you are tired, afraid, you are bored, thirsty for rest or evils?  Or maybe this is due to the fact that you are not sure whether you have enough time for a task or are there no pending tasks? <br><br>  <strong>6. Kill your fears</strong> - I am sure that you do not have a phobia of well-done things.  But at the same time, hidden fears or discomfort can interfere with the actual work.  Get rid of the uncertainties and make sure that you are able to cope with the problem, even if things go according to the worst scenario. <br><br>  <strong>7. Find a partner</strong> - Find someone who will motivate you when you are lazy.  I have a friend with whom I go to the gym.  In addition to determining the loads, it can also motivate you to work more when, in the normal case, you would have already quit the job. <br><br>  <strong>8. Accelerate Your Day</strong> - Plan Your Tomorrow.  Wake up early and do all the most important things early in the morning.  The task of the impulse in the morning usually helps to pace all day. <br><br>  <strong>9. Read books</strong> - not only on development, personal growth and motivating books, but any books with new ideas.  New ideas turn the wheels in my head and can contribute to motivation.  Learning new ideas makes your brain work, so less time is needed for overclocking. <br><br>  <strong>10. Get the right tools</strong> - Everything that surrounds you can have a strong effect on your enthusiasm.  Slow computers, inefficient applications or constantly breaking down a car can ruin your motivation.  Creating motivation is almost as important as skillful trapping traps that can stop this creation. <br><br>  <strong>11. Small problems do not happen</strong> - Facing a problem that only seems small, greatly reduces motivation and creates endless frustration.  Rethink small problems to apply the same solutions to them that you apply to large ones, or they will kill your drive. <br><br>  <strong>12. Develop a prayer</strong> - It is necessary to find a few statements that focus the thoughts and motivate you.  It does not matter whether you take this statement from a reminder sheet or it will be just a few words that tell you what to do.  If you don‚Äôt know where to start, a great personal prayer will be ‚ÄúDo it now!‚Äù <br><br>  <strong>13. Strive for success</strong> - Success leads to success.  When you have just won, it is very easy to feel motivated to anything.  Emotions do not depend on the specificity of the situation, so a small victory, be it a compliment from a colleague or the completion of two thirds of your work before dinner, can awaken your strength instantly.  There are many ways to use early small successes to motivate yourself later.  This will help structuring lists of necessary cases or placing tasks such as charging at the beginning of the day. <br><br>  Source <a href="http://www.lifehack.org/articles/productivity/thirteen-tricks-to-motivate-yourself.html">Lifehack.org</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/31259/">https://habr.com/ru/post/31259/</a></p>
