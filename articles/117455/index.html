It is this saying that leads me through life and allows me to get acquainted with certain products at the stage of their initial development.  My old acquaintance appeared in Moscow, who brought a lot of news about Nokia and Windows Phone 7, and he also had one of the prototypes of such a device.  Especially for Nokia lawyers I will add that this device does not belong to me.  I would venture to share with you a number of impressions, as well as additional information that I learned from our communication. <br><br>  <b>Nokia plans for WP7 - 4 devices in development</b> <br>  Inside MS there are specifications for WP7 devices, the so-called chassis (chassis - I'm not sure what I am writing, but the word is just that - chassis).  At the moment, all the variety of devices available on WP7 is very similar to each other - they have the same functionality, thanks to WP7 and the lack of customization, the same processors, the Qualcomm platform, as a result, very similar impressions and performance.  Today, there is no difference in the device of which manufacturer to buy, they all look alike, the differences are minimal (screen type, battery, case materials, and so on). <br><br>  At the end of the year, a second wave of devices comes out, the so-called chassis2, there are certain indulgences in relation to the performance of the devices (the processor may not be so fast).  But at the same time, chassis2 allows you to add new form factors - for example, QWERTY all-in-one PCs with touch screens, which Windows Mobile was known for at one time.  All manufacturers create such models today, these are HTC, Samsung, LG and a number of other companies, even the SE conducts similar developments and studies the issue.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  For Nokia, this trend is absolutely new for many reasons, but the main and main one is that the company has been suing Qualcomm for many years and is historically an antagonist.  The deal with MS and the requirements of the manufacturer forced Nokia to use Qualcomm chipsets, today's prototypes are built on them, do not use any other solutions (although Nokia really wanted not to use Qualcomm, but MS‚Äôs position is tough on this issue). <br><br>  Nokia was left with the freedom to choose what they would do on the chassis2 and the company very briskly began to build prototypes, and this was done before the official announcement of a possible deal with MS.  Elop really wants the first products to appear by Christmas 2011, but most likely it will still be the end of January, February. <br><br>  The time limit caused the need to use ready-made developments in the field of design, in particular, the prototype that was held in the hands of your humble servant, nothing more than the Nokia X7 with another screen (WVGA), the QSD8250 chipset.  I have the use of the same chipset as in a pile of other products already on the market has caused many questions.  Why not actually something new from Qualcomm?  The answer was quite expected - it was necessary to start from something, this chipset was initially available, so we started the work, literally, from the wheels.  At the moment, this model and, accordingly, the prototype are most ready, they are alive and you can see what WP7 plus Nokia is. <br><br>  We even joked that the X7 was chosen simply by the numerical index, as the model that best suits the requirements of MS - we need a seven in the name.  But this is only a joke. <br><br>  The case from Nokia X7, the screen from the new supplier (this is not Samsung, the screen is not AMOLED, but everything can change, and the screen quality is very good, I liked it).  The design of the device is memorable, so there are no complaints.  I emphasize that this prototype was actually important in order to get very fast working samples and starting from them to do the rest. <br><br>  There are no miracles in the world, and this model reminded me of all the impressions HTC Mozart, exactly the same functionality.  The camera is installed, by the way, with 8 megapixel autofocus and there is a flash.  In principle, at all WP7 from Nokia more expensive than a certain level of the camera will be with autofocus, this will be different from Symbian products and this is a conscious decision. <br><br>  This model is planned to be the first to launch on the market.  In fact, it is already ready in a certain condition, so that in the standard form, it can be launched even in the fall.  And here comes the main question, whether MS will allow to customize the Nokia phone software or not.  At the moment, the position of MS is very simple - no special preferences will be made for Nokia.  If the possibility of customization appears, it will be given to all.  Something like this. <br><br>  Therefore, W7 is used as a test device, the company's engineers stuff their bumps on it, learn and so on.  In general, according to my friend, there are many new experiences that need to be accumulated; they study many small, but time-consuming questions.  Learn in one word.  And studies probably better on proven things. <br><br>  <b>Three other devices from Nokia - camera, QWERTY, cheap touchscreen</b> <br>  I didn‚Äôt see other devices, I could write something wrong, because I have a little confusion in my head, so much information fell out on me.  But let's try to tell what hit the memory. <br><br>  <b>Nokia N8 version for WP7</b> .  Nokia quite logically suggested that transferring a 12-megapixel camera (or similar module) to WP7 would give them an advantage, since there are no photoresolutions on this platform.  It will be interesting for a certain part of the audience.  The design of the model will be based on the N8, but it will be made noticeably different, this is one of the tasks (at the moment there is no design, the model is only at the initial stage of construction).  The second ideological solution looks like this - to make it the most powerful smartphone on WP7 by the time it was released at the end of the first, the beginning of the second quarter of 2012.  This involves the use of a new platform from Qualcomm, a dual-core processor and an Adreno 320 accelerator. But as they say TBD, as long as Nokia doesn‚Äôt understand what solutions and when they can use Qualcomm.  Chances are that you will have to create this device in a hurry on the "old" chipset and then release another version.  To understand what is happening inside, it is enough to say that the specifications of the phones change weekly depending on the information that comes after studying certain issues.  For Nokia, this is a completely new theme. <br><br>  In any case, the priority is to work on the camera for WP7, this work is already underway.  That is, the company, regardless of the specific product, adapts the camera from the N8 for the platform, which is not bad, as it will give Nokia a real advantage. <br><br>  <b>QWERTY monoblock with touch screen</b> .  Another model that is created on the basis of the prerequisites that the Nokia E72 and this line are quite successful in the market, respectively, it will be quite easy to switch their users to Nokia solutions.  Touch screen, QWERTY-keyboard.  Metal case.  The design is currently unknown, apparently it will be one of the models that was originally developed for Symbian. <br><br>  The chips as such in Nokia can not add to the OS.  Therefore, it is necessary to invent something new, apparently there will be a lot of marketing terms that will explain the existing technologies in the Nokia version.  This, by the way, is a key move in the field of WP7 and marketing for Nokia products (W8 is an exception, since there objectively the camera will be an asset). <br><br>  The company is actively developing a service for corporate users with a certain subscription system.  Apparently it will be a feature of this device (whether it will be available everywhere, I did not understand, as well as the meaning of the service, my interlocutor did not fully understand this question for himself).  In fact, this kind of mythical service should be the USP unique selling point for the device.  Given that it can not be an app store, then most likely something related to the cloud, mail, and so on.  But I do not know what exactly. <br><br>  The release date is around March, April.  They promise a very competitive price of 350 Euro.  This is the target for this model. <br><br>  <b>"Cheap" touchscreen</b> <br>  In this model, the bet is on the cost.  Most likely there will be the same hardware solution as in W7, cheaper case materials, but also significantly lower cost.  The device will have to compete with the first generation of the device, as well as the second from other manufacturers, but in its price group.  Very affordable WP7 phone.  The camera will be trimmed, to what state it is not yet clear, most likely it will be a ‚Äúfull‚Äù focus. <br><br>  The model should appear very quickly.  In fact, this is the beginning of the year and reasonable cost.  While more about it is not known. <br><br>  <b>Other models</b> <br>  On the basis of W7 they will make a flagship, this is clear and understandable, a different design, an acceptable and good camera, but this is already the second wave of devices (if they don‚Äôt have time to change the chipset and make it different, then there are a lot of ambiguities - they will have time and will be able to, but chances are 50 by 50 for now).  For the photo solution, exactly the same story, they want to be in time with the new chipset, how it will turn out to be unclear.  If you have time, then the model will be one.  If not, then, like for W7, a sequel will appear, an update with a more powerful hardware. <br><br>  A total of 12 devices are planned for 2012, in addition to those I described.  Their development has not begun, a model line is currently being formed, which is being shattered with the fact that it will be released on Symbian.  The maximum priority is given to WP7, while there is a study of models on Android (the company has not refused this option, it all depends on WP7 sales in the first half of 2012). <br><br>  In Nokia, the main task at the moment is to find options for how to differ from other manufacturers of WP7 phones, as this is the basis for success.  So far, nothing has been found except the camera.  I keep quiet about the service, because I don‚Äôt understand that it can be in what form.  A sort of spherical horse in a vacuum. <br><br>  A lot of effort on marketing, on popularization, an explanation of already existing technologies under the names that will be associated with Nokia and only it.  The way out is this. <br><br>  Unfortunately, Symbian has been rejected, in fact, we saw the rise of this platform at the beginning of this year (in the sense that the number of models, their interestingness, and so on), later models will be derived, the main developments on WP7 or other platforms.  About 6,000 Symbian / Maemo developers will leave the company in the coming year, the largest reduction.  Until the end of the life cycle, three major updates are planned for Symbian ^ 3.  So, in July, in some markets in August it will be PR2.0, then at the end of autumn an ‚Äã‚Äãintermediate version and by mid-2012 PR 3.0.  Terms may vary.  A critical mass of changes for Symbian ^ 3 is not planned, the company believes that they will sell phones at the expense of low prices.  At the same time, similar WP7 products will cost more than their counterparts on Symbian.  Which is understandable. <br><br>  PS I specifically want to emphasize that at the moment, apart from one model, Nokia does not have prototypes of future devices, the development is at an early stage.  Short deadlines force us to use already known solutions (design).  It changes a little, but it is cosmetic things.  Also, the company is constantly changing plans, depending on what Nokia learns about the products, their compatibility and so on.  Timing, price, positioning, product specifications can change quite a lot.  But I think you were able to endure the direction of the thoughts, the development of the company. <br><br>  If you liked this text, tell the author thanks, I will be pleased.  And thank you for reading. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/117455/">https://habr.com/ru/post/117455/</a></p>
