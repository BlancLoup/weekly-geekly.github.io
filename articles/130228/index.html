It is difficult to attach one's head to another person and things that are obvious to one can be a secret behind seven seals to another. <br><br>  Interestingly, in 90% of cases, all these situations are resolved by only one personal meeting, when in words (and not in ICQ, breaking fingers or breaking voice in Skype), clear arguments in favor of a decision are made.

      Indeed, in every field, be it web-design or production of fittings, everything is subject to well-defined and strict laws.  These are usually the laws of harmony and expediency. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  And to explain to the customer and the buyer that in fact we are not ‚Äúcreative‚Äù and not ‚Äúinventing‚Äù, but doing it this way, not ‚Äúbecause it is fashionable and cool‚Äù, but because it is a necessity justified by the goals set, the technology used, the standards and laws of work.  But you need to explain calmly and in simple words. <br><br>  If there is already a conflict for various reasons, you do not need to prove your point of view, you need to find out and explain the reasons for the situation, because  the negative is not directed to you personally, but to the company.  And take on the special control of such customers.  This is an invaluable experience in our work. <br><br>  We all work with people and various kinds of situations of discontent are inevitable.  In this case, your task is to smooth the conflict and treat the problem with attention, show that you do not deny its existence and are ready to solve it. <br><br>  Often just one call and one ‚ÄúI apologize for not being able to contact you for a week‚Äù can defuse the situation.  After all, situations really happen to be very different. <br><br>  PS Although in fact, customers still come across those :).  Thank God, in my practice it is a rarity.  You need to think about the reasons for this or that behavior of your customers. <br><br><h4>  In relation to site building (ideal). </h4><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/d4baf682/3f145590/2bbae55b/e12adbe6.jpg"></div><br>  <b>Frequent customer questions:</b> <br><ul><li>  And competitors have the same, but cheaper </li><li>  And I was told that flash is cool and that everyone should have it </li><li>  ... (continue by yourself) </li></ul><br><h5>  Explain the essence of the work on the site can and should be simple words </h5><br>  Everyone wants to get a site like a product.  Website development is a service and they pay not only for the web resource, but also for the work process itself.  One of the main cost items is communication, during which the customer (if you are a professional) understands what he really wants.  This helps him save time, money and nerves.  And you - get another good project in the portfolio, which is not a shame to show. <br><br>  Those.  in the process of work, the customer must understand that for someone the site is a free template and Joomla, plus domain registration and 20 minutes to place leaflets copied from Word, and this is 3,000 rubles and 2 days of work, and then six months nerves and search artist, <br>  but for someone a <b>successful site</b> = <br>  analysis of the target audience and its interests + <br>  search for company benefits, products, services + <br>  writing texts, their design for the convenience of people (if the text is written, then it should be read) + <br>  drawing layouts and design justification + <br>  management system selection and design integration + <br>  filling the site with ready materials + <br>  audience attraction + <br>  web analytics + <br>  a lot of time to learn and convince the customer. <br>  and in the end - a resource that works without major problems for a couple of years, which completely pays for the costs. <br><br><h5>  Technology and Fashion </h5><br>  Most companies want to be fashionable and with cheers sign bills for the Internet, thinking that they are really modern. <br><br>  In fact - they spend the advertising budget, because the effectiveness of the methods used to attract attention, no one tracks in reality.  Maximum - numbers on counters and positions in search engines.  See behind the numbers of living people is not given to many. <br><br>  The technology itself does not give any advantages if you cannot apply it and correctly evaluate its work.  You can install new machines at the factory, but without having trained employees to work with them, it is foolish to wait for the result.  You can put Skype on the site, but if no one answers the call ... <br><br>  The site is the same machine.  And it is necessary to explain to the customer that it is necessary to change themselves under the application of a particular technology, or to find those technologies with which at this stage they can work and get the same result. <br><br>  It is possible that for him it will not be the Internet at all. <br><br>  That is why sites are not considered as a source of income, because  No one binds the picture on the Internet with the money that he earns.  But then there is a certainty that the Internet is full of money and all who work there are either shamans and lucky people or fraudsters. <br><br>  <b>You need to communicate</b> , you need to justify your point of view and always keep in touch with your customers in order to understand what problems exist between you.  <b>And they are always there</b> .  We are people. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/130228/">https://habr.com/ru/post/130228/</a></p>
