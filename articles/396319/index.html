  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Sony Xperia XA review. Beautiful smartphone at a nice price</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  As you know, the newest line of Sony smartphones includes four models: Xperia X, X Perfomance, XA Ultra and XA.  The latter is the youngest, the most inexpensive and at the same time the most attractive.  At least, this smartphone has a number of unique features that are not peculiar to other models.  This is a great choice for those who want to get a stylish device at a good price.  Well, let's take a closer look at the new product and see what else it might appeal to the sophisticated user. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b01/e0c/98b/b01e0c98b2264fe78718d52f22128c63.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Design </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/744/a42/66b/744a4266bcd446528523908e5c87be5f.jpg"><br><br>  Sony Xperia XA is equipped with a five-inch display (1280x720) with 2.5D glass, which smoothly rounded closer to the edges and even barely walks on the side faces of the case.  There is practically no frame on the sides, and this has a great effect on the design of the smartphone.  Despite the five-inch screen, the device case remains very narrow (only 66.8 mm wide) and fits perfectly in the hand.  Even in the female palm, the smartphone will not seem to be a "shovel."  You can easily type text with one hand, although in models with five or more inches this is usually a problem.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/284/43d/c56/28443dc564e54ebda3e1fdd6adc70a60.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0ac/f9d/4a5/0acf9d4a5726498a9c72e3560c5f1026.jpg"><br><br>  On connectors, everything is standard.  At the top is a 3.5 mm headset input and an additional microphone that is used to operate the noise cancellation system.  On the left side there is a cover that hides the nanoSIM SIM card slot and microSD card slot.  The maximum amount of memory card can reach 200 GB.  In addition, there is a version of the Xperia XA Dual, which has two slots for SIM-cards. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b41/902/998/b41902998fe44d15aa8422c653447c4d.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8c1/ee1/710/8c1ee17102124961b9d91320a1472a73.jpg"><br><br>  On the right is the volume rocker, next to it is the shutter button and quick start button, and there is a round metal power button.  Just like on past Sony Xperia models.  And finally, at the bottom there is the main microphone, external speaker and microUSB connector, which is used to connect the charger and connect it to the computer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a63/e4d/bcf/a63e4dbcffdd49ed83b4df4cf899a26d.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eda/620/683/eda62068360042f5b963e4a03fa664f6.jpg"><br><br>  The model is available in four colors: white, graphite black, lime gold and rose gold.  The last two shades are exclusively female, but the tastes are certainly different.  The side trim is metal, but the back cover is made of pleasant matte plastic, but in appearance it can not be said - the material looks very similar to metal.  Assembling the case, as always, on top. <br><br><h2>  Filling </h2><br>  The model is based on an eight-core MediaTek Helio P10 processor with 64-bit architecture, which has already become the norm, including for low-cost smartphones.  For processing video chip is responsible ARM Mali-T860 MP2.  RAM - two gigabytes, this will be enough in any applications.  The smartphone was not easy to load.  Running standard applications and widgets, watching videos, heavy 3D games - the device is all for nothing.  The model comes out of the box with smart Android 6.0.  Xperia XA is equipped with 16 GB of internal memory, about five gigabytes is occupied by the operating system, and about ten are available to you. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e94/269/555/e942695555fa4421974a91f334093835.png"><br><br>  Xperia XA test results in popular benchmarks confirm all of the above.  The smartphone perfectly copes with office and multimedia applications and not bad shows itself in games.  I believe that in the resolution of FullHD or QHD, many games would go slower, but in the native resolution for a smartphone of 1280x720, everything works exceptionally smoothly. <br><br>  The battery capacity of 2300 mAh is held on one charge for about two days during normal use: not denying to work with a mobile phone when it is needed, but not playing on it from morning to evening.  In the worst case scenario, you can count on the day of autonomy. <br><br>  Let me remind you that Sony is actively cooperating with the company Qnovo.  The Xperia X family of models, including the XA, received Qnovo Adaptive Charging Technology, which is designed to reduce the natural deterioration of the battery when charging, controlling the current supply process. <br><br>  We should also mention Xperia Tips.  This is a kind of intelligent assistant who monitors your actions and gives various clues.  Say, in the winter, the device itself will offer to turn on the screen with gloves - it seems to be a trifle, but it's nice that the device itself seeks to make your life easier. <br><br>  The sound is also given more attention.  Technologies implemented Clear Audio +, Clear Stereo, Clear Bass and Clear Phase, as well as xLoud, which increases the volume of the speakers without sacrificing quality.  All together it gives a clear and rich sound that using headphones, that when listening to music through the speakers. <br><br><h2>  Camera </h2><br>  Sony has equipped the Xperia XA with two excellent cameras.  The front 8 megapixel module is equipped with autofocus, it helps a lot when shooting selfies.  The lens is wide-angle, at 88 degrees. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2d2/340/138/2d234013806141199d69d4995e9b5b68.jpg"><br><br>  The main camera is even better - 13 megapixel, quick start and hybrid autofocus.  As well as the front, the rear camera supports HDR, and besides it can automatically recognize the types of shots.  This is useful when you need to quickly make a frame and do not have time to deal with the settings.  Images are sharp and sharp.  And although the Xperia XA is considered the youngest in the line, no one saved on optics.  Below you can see examples of shooting with the main camera with maximum quality settings. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2a8/e1c/d66/2a8e1cd66f144a60b06764f519539d0c.JPG"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e23/ee5/fbf/e23ee5fbf41d499f94704fac15bd132f.JPG"><br><br><h2>  findings </h2><br>  Xperia XA came out successful and at the same time inexpensive, its price is only 21,990 rubles.  The optimal diagonal of the device with good dimensions, the lack of side frames, productive stuffing - Xperia XA is so good that it is time to think whether it is worth overpaying for top models.  If you absolutely need a Full HD screen, you will need to contact the older Xperia smartphones.  Otherwise, you can stay on the younger model and be completely satisfied with the purchase. <br><br><h2>  Key Sony Xperia XA specifications </h2><br><ul><li>  <b>Display</b> size: 5 inches; </li><li>  <b>Display resolution</b> : HD (1280x720 pixels, density ~ 294 ppi); </li><li>  <b>Chipset</b> : Mediatek MT6755 Helio P10 (8 cores, 2 GHz); </li><li>  <b>Memory</b> : 2 GB operative, 16 GB non-volatile, slot for microSD memory cards up to 200 GB; </li><li>  <b>Main camera</b> : 13 megapixel, LED flash, video recording in Full HD resolution; </li><li>  <b>Front camera</b> : 8 megapixel with wide-angle and high-aperture optics; </li><li>  <b>Battery</b> : Li-ion, 2300 mAh, non-removable; </li><li>  <b>SIM card format</b> : nano-SIM; </li><li>  <b>Optional</b> : fingerprint sensor, NFC </li><li>  <b>Operating system</b> : Android 6.0 Marshmallow </li><li>  <b>Dimensions and weight</b> : 143.6 x 66.8 x 7.9 mm;  139 g; </li><li>  <b>The price in Russia</b> : 21 990 rubles / 22 990 (Dual SIM) </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/396319/">https://habr.com/ru/post/396319/</a></p>
