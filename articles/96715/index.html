  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Commercial support for open source software, or the fight against the soviet mentality</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> The company, in which I have been working for a long time, is engaged in the commercial support of open source software Asterisk. <br>  Asterisk is a software telephone exchange (IP PBX) distributed in source code.  Powered by Linux and FreeBSD. <br><br>  The system got its name from regular expressions, in which an asterisk (*) means any characters, with a hint that Asterisk will be able to do everything.  As the ship was named, it floated in the same way - Asterisk really can do everything (let's keep silent about the quality with which it does this ‚Äúeverything‚Äù, this is beyond the scope of this article).  This ‚Äúall‚Äù has a downside - it is not easy for a newbie to deal with Asterisk.  Graphical interfaces (FreePbx, for example) and ready distributions (TrixBox) for dummies, on the one hand, lower the entry barrier to Asterisk, but on the other hand, they only make things worse.  To install and configure ‚Äúclean‚Äù Asterisk without ‚Äúwrappers‚Äù, you need to read the documentation, after which there is at least a basic understanding of the principles of the IP telephony system, and the problem of connecting the IP PBX to the communications provider does not enter into a stupor.  Those who install the system with one click, then in a panic call for help in the forums, formulating questions in such a way that they do not want to be answered.  And on such questions forumchane usually send for commercial support.  Thus, commercial technical support is needed by everyone :-) But!  Our people in the majority do not know how to calculate the imputed costs.  Instead of buying the attention of a specialist to his problem, quickly learn from him, and ‚Äúgo‚Äù further, our man will spend a lot of time and nerves (his own, the director and other employees), but he will ‚Äúfight on the ice‚Äù on his own.  And all because there is no mass culture of one-time attraction of consultants and payment for their time.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm wondering, but I won‚Äôt cry‚Äù - here it is the first ‚Äúcockroach‚Äù of a typical post-Soviet IT person. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Someone may argue, they say, it‚Äôs better to figure it out yourself than to spend money.  I agree, if you are a provider (it doesn't matter whether small or large), and telephony issues arise constantly.  But for an ordinary company, the principle ‚Äúeveryone does his own business‚Äù is more appropriate.  Modern telecommunications is a very complicated and ‚Äúvoluminous‚Äù business, and quick problem solving requires a wealth of experience and knowledge.  The time spent on the development of this business is not comparable with the cost of attracting a specialist.  But even if the Customer understands this, and comes for commercial support, or even a turnkey solution, we are faced with the following post-Soviet ‚Äúcockroach‚Äù - distrust.  Let us consider a specific example.  Without names, addresses.  Therefore, the person with whom this correspondence took place should not be offended.  It is the same as many others.  Simply, he became the ‚Äúlast straw‚Äù that overflowed the cup of silence :-) Moreover, it is possible that he will help others to realize their misconceptions and make the world more positive: :-) <br><br>  So.  Correspondence.  Initial request from the city of Tyumen:

      Hello, Maxim.  Asterisk setting required: <br>  1. A greeting (our voice) <br>  2. Minimum IVR (our voice is the ability to select the caller‚Äôs manager) <br>  3. Internal communication - 5 phones <br>  4. External output via local provider sip (provider-name.ru) <br>  5. Through the prefix - intercity via sipnet.ru <br>  6. Call Transfer <br>  7. Call Pickup <br>  8. Fax to email. <br>  Maybe something else ... <br>  Conditions: <br>  Installation on my hardware, (computer + 2 PAP2T gateways) will be freshly installed Elastix, the gateway configuration will not be required - it will be already configured. <br>  FXO ports are not. <br><br>  Comments: nothing unusual, everything is done trivially.  Unless of course, know how.  But let's take a look.  In this project, two risk factors are an unknown ‚Äúshtetl‚Äù provider and installation on Customer‚Äôs hardware.  The customer does not know how much time it is possible to ‚Äúkill‚Äù to butt with a provider who does not miss calls, and claims that everything is normal on his part, and he refuses to recognize logs proving the opposite.  Also, the Customer had no experience installing Linux on a motherboard with a cheap RAID controller SASMF8I (http://asteriskpbx.ru/wiki/intel-raid-sasmf8i-install-howto), and what kind of hardware the Customer will have to learn in the process.  The customer really wants to save money, so he takes noname iron, even himself (imagine yourself, in one click), puts Elastix on him (which takes about 10 minutes).  Oh yes!  Fax!!!  The customer does not know that there are such fax machines that respond to work with interface cards, and also ... fax over IP ... The customer does not know what T.38 is, support for it or not, and generally passing a fax over VoIP ... It‚Äôs nothing does not know, and therefore wants to do everything for him.  Fine!  Here it is a model of open source business!  We all know, we will do everything.  Everything would be fine if not ... money.  ‚ÄúName the estimated cost of setting‚Äù - this is how the Customer ends his letter.  And now I will describe the evolution of our answers to this key question. <br><br>  So, the first approach is TK.  Yes, Terms of Reference. <br>  The Terms of Reference is a comprehensive comprehensive document drawn up by the Contractor (!) According to the requirements of the Customer, where all aspects of the project are worked out in all the smallest details.  It takes a lot of time to write and approve TK! <br>  The task of the TK is to shake out all his wishes from the Customer, formulate them, describe the method of implementation, estimate the time spent on their implementation, and make a calculation that will be the answer to the question ‚Äúhow much and when‚Äù.  Once before, we were engaged in the development of software, and automatically transferred the ‚Äúdeveloper approach‚Äù, namely, ‚Äúpay first the writing of the TK, and then we will find out how much‚Äù.  But only the software development approach began to slip from the very beginning.  Well, the potential customer didn‚Äôt want to understand what we want the money for ... Arguments that we spend time on it did not touch him much.  He said, ‚ÄúSo I sent you the TK (as in the example above), what else to write?‚Äù.  In response, they sent him an example of the TK of another project, he responded in detail to commenting on it (‚ÄúWell, here's to you TZ‚Äù), with details of his environment, which gave rise to a counter letter, where he was clearly shown that there was still a lot of questions to which he again gave Answer :-) Thus, in a dispute with the Customer about whether he needs TK or not, it turned out TK, and there was nothing to pay for - the requirements were discussed, analyzed, described, time was spent.  But not paid.  And the project does not include it.  But only 20% of Customers got involved in the dispute.  The rest after the offer to pay the TZ merged forever, and attempts to return them sometimes stumbled upon rudeness and rudeness :-) <br><br>  Then we thought up to write off TZ for production costs.  And implicitly scatter the time spent writing it on the project.  Received orders became more.  The download has grown so much that it suddenly became noticeable that the time it took to create a technical task, to approve it, to rework it, to approve, it took significantly more than the time spent on the project.  And we deeply thought - and do we need TK at all?  they do not want to pay it, a lot of time is spent.  Of course, TK is a great thing, it allows you to minimize the risks of unjustified expectations and deadlines.  It allows you to display an honest assessment of the cost of the project - the Contractor does the agreed work within the stipulated time and the Customer regularly pays for them.  Without TK there can be three situations: <br>  1) an approximate estimate at the initial stage coincides with the real costs of labor resources - a rare case; <br>  2) an approximate estimate of labor costs, given at the initial stage, exceeds the resources expended (the project is overvalued) - the Contractor is happy, the Customer has been deceived. <br>  3) The initial estimate is less than the actual time spent - the Customer is happy, the Contractor is angry, forcing him to work for free.  About the quality of services provided in this version keep silent. <br><br>  But, nevertheless, the specificity of the implementation of Asterisk is that it is easier to rely on statistics.  Print the average cost of the project ‚Äúwe will do everything for X thousand rubles.‚Äù, Sign a contract, invoice for 50%, make a project, get the rest.  And at the initial stage it worked.  But then precedents appeared.  Customers changed the requirements several times in the implementation process, drafted with the signing of acts, came up with new requirements, and in response to unequivocal hints, they poked their fingers into a contract that, under conditions of unclear initial requirements, was more like a gentlemen's agreement.  In short, almost falling into slavery, we covered this shop, went out on the porch, and again thought.  And they remembered the distant 2004, when we were just starting to deal with Asterisk, when nobody knew anything about it in runet, and we did projects for the Western bourgeoisie.  Raised the correspondence.  And they were shocked.  We did not have any problems with the evaluation of the project.  Her (evaluation) was not there.  Everyone had a tariff - $ USD / hour.  The first letter of the burzhuin answered that everything is possible, the cost of such an hour, to pay at max@paypal.com, prepayment for at least 3, 5, 10 or more hours.  The customer paid the same day, we did the work.  Further, the Customer either took an advance again or paid after the fact.  After the first ‚ÄúKidos‚Äù, we learned to do the ‚Äútime bomb‚Äù, which was hidden in the init scripts, and if it was not de-activated after payment, at a certain moment it took down all the results of our work, packed them into the archive, and hid in the depths file system.  The careless Customer gladly paid the balance, and additional recovery time :-) We also remembered that when the demand for commercial support Asterisk began to take shape in Russia, we also tried the old hourly approach, but he ‚Äúdid not go‚Äù right away, and we quickly abandoned it, applying the approach of developers.  But everything returns to normal :-) <br>  And we, knowing the alternative approaches to pricing Asterisk projects, again began to offer customers to pay for our, time spent on its tasks.  And you know, something has changed!  Some even began to agree!  The best client (hello, Oleg!) Immediately paid for 50 hours (a year ahead), perfectly understands Asterisk and IP telephony, but for all tasks that go beyond simple support (‚Äúdraw‚Äù new functionality, or decide ‚Äúrake‚Äù), refers to us.  So I am sure that we will do it better and faster, and he is able to appreciate his time.  But, nevertheless, such dialogues most often occur (original text): <br><br>  - Hello.  The cost of an hour is 2,200.  Approximately 3 hours.  Prepay.  Invoice? <br><br>  - Maxim, while the computer is not assembled.  As soon as - I will appeal to you.  Thanks for the quick response. <br><br>  - Maybe while we solve the commercial issue?  We allow a periodic loan, but do not start without prepayment. <br><br>  - Maxim, I am ready to work with you, but what's the point of starting work without a computer on which there will be an asterisk?  We still do not physically have a computer for an asterisk :) You can, of course, issue an invoice for an advance payment of 50%.  Tomorrow I'll take off the details. <br><br>  - Sergey, 3 hours, this is the minimum time.  No 50%, not enough for another 10 thousand. Two bills to expose ... <br><br>  - I just did not understand your phrase about going on credit.  I understand the conditions are: our payment is 3 hours, then you work until you finish?  Those.  it could be four and five o'clock ... and six ??  I will give you the exact settings of our sip provider, I will write the most understandable to you TK.  I am a very good customer and I know what I need.  I think we go to bed at three o'clock.  :) <br><br>  - Sergei.  The cost of our services is 2,200 rubles.  at one o'clock.  No matter what it is spent on.  3 hours - the minimum cost. <br>  It will take more time - the next package is purchased on those.  support, 3 hours minimum.  And so on until your Wishlist is exhausted. <br><br>  - Maxim, for you of course this form of payment is very convenient, but for me as a client - not very.  "3 - hour minimum costs" - for what?  I want to know what will be done in the allotted time, what they will be spent on, what will be set up during this time ??  (You can add extensions to 5 phones in 15 minutes, or you can set them up and 2 days at 6600 in three hours) You can tell how much time you need to set up: <br>  1. Greeting (our voice) (5 minutes) <br>  2. Minimum IVR (our voice is the ability to select the caller‚Äôs manager) (10 minutes) <br>  3. Intercom - 5 phones (work for 15 minutes) <br>  4. External output via sip (Tyumen provider) (trunk setting) <br>  5. Through the prefix - intercity via sipnet.ru (you have 100% ready config, or you remember it from memory) <br>  6. Call transfer (dial-up) <br>  7. Call Pickup (Dialline) <br>  8. Fax to email. <br>  Security setting (change default passwords, etc.) <br>  If you can‚Äôt answer the above question, I have a new one - Does your company have a questionnaire (brief) to study my website and calculate the approximate cost of development? <br>  PS I‚Äôm sure you have a lot of work, please don‚Äôt let me down for a while, but tell me how much money I need for this job <br><br>  - Hello, Sergey.  Not ready to get involved in correspondence and disputes.  This is our approach and point.  I can only say that your risks are limited to 6600 rubles.  Do not like the pace of work and results - stop cooperation.  Subject to good faith, this form of work is ideally suited to both the Customer and the Contractor, at least everything is fair - the work is done and paid in full.  Decide. <br><br>  - Hello, Maxim.  I understood your approach quite clearly: I buy your time, and you can use it as you wish, for example, drinking tea for 40 minutes.  You can‚Äôt give me any time limits in my TK and it makes me angry.  I don‚Äôt know anything about your work rate and you don‚Äôt want to tell me anything about it (I‚Äôm interested in what works will be completed in 3 hours?).  I understand you correctly?  Is this your personal position or the position of the company? <br>  PS <br>  If you have a car - you know that the cost of repair / replacement is made clearly at normal hours.  But the total cost of repair / replacement does not depend on the amount of time spent, since  the time of the works of the workshop master depends on his qualifications, experience and salary.  those.  if the replacement of the hub is worth 2 thousand rubles a normal hour, I will give 2 thousand!  And if the master will tinker with her for half a day - because  these are his personal problems.  So why can't you tell me what will be done in three hours? <br><br>  ... I do not know what to answer to the last letter of the Customer.  To write that Asterisk to fully implement is not oil change?  That often there are various unforeseen situations arising due to the nuances of the customer's environment ... Give examples of how dozens of hours were put to solve the problems of voice rattling, and tiredly asked to change the network switch The customer swore obscenities, and then changed, and it all worked ?  Why do we need to convince the customer that he should pay for our work.  It seems to me that the principle of outsourcing lies in the fact that the Customer temporarily hires an external specialist who solves his tasks and leaves, and the Customer is engaged in his core business, without being particularly distracted.  After all, you can "take the risk" to pay a few hours, see how it goes ... After all, most often "go"!  The customer does not appeal to students, and this is immediately clear.  Where does mistrust, suspicion, and ridiculous assumptions about tea, coffee and nose picking come from?  The risk is limited to several thousand ... Try it ... You can finally find negative reviews on the Internet ... <br>  How!?  How to expel these cockroaches from the mentality of Russian IT managers and system administrators !? <br>  Hourly pay is the ideal form of cooperation with professionals.  You pay - we honestly do our job like you never do, because you will not catch up with us for 6 years.  Why is this the norm for the bourgeoisie, and the explosion of the brain for our people?  Nipanyatnaa ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/96715/">https://habr.com/ru/post/96715/</a></p>
