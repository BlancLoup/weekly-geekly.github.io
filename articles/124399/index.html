(theory)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h4>  Question: How to create an e-economy in Russia? </h4><br>  Let's dream.  Agree, it would be great when choosing the right product or service to use a single source of information, and not to scour the entire Internet in search of the necessary? <br>  Would you use Google for this purpose if you knew that the Catalog [1] gives you the opportunity to filter by the location of a product (country, city), manufacturer, brand, grade, weight, size, color, taste, smell - whatever product properties? <br>  Here you will see a photo (for example, images of the vacuum cleaner being sold, first from the side, then from above, then with the dust collector removed and, finally, in the hands of an attractive vacuuming girl), and a video clip (for example, how to assemble a sold bicycle in 15 minutes) and audio recording ( for example, the sound of a starting motorcycle)!  And besides - the most detailed description from the manufacturer about all the charms of the goods. <br>  And most importantly - the ability to compare!  If you need a cell phone without bells and whistles, just call and sms - why is the Siemens A45 "brick" necessary?  Just customize your search using filters - and select the appropriate ... <br>  The saddest thing about this is that this Catalog is not yet ... [2] But this article is about this: how to create such a Catalog in Russia? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  What do we want? </h4><br>  Wikipedia gives us this dry formal definition: <br>  Electronic (networked, digital) economy - an environment that exists thanks to digital telecommunications networks (the World Wide Web, the Internet) in which subjects can carry out any economic activity, as well as an economy that operates on electronic goods and services produced by electronic business and electronic commerce.  Payments for services and goods of the e-economy are made by electronic money.  [3] <br><br>  Translated into Russian, this means: <br>  a) <b>Electronic catalog of all goods of Russia</b> <br>  b) <b>Fast and convenient search with multiple filters</b> <br>  c) <b>Delivery options</b> : filters by weight, size, distance, delivery time, price, do you need movers, etc. <br>  d) <b>Reviews, ratings, comments of other users</b> <br>  e) <b>Online availability information</b> <br>  e) <b>Ease of calculation</b> : without any details, p / s, etc.  (nothing needs to be entered constantly; maybe only the 1st time);  instantly;  with the ability to check and prove payment;  transactions are irrevocable (important for sellers), but with the possibility of arbitration and compensation (important for buyers).  Compensation means that the purchase transaction is not canceled, and a new one is created - compensation - in the opposite direction.  (In this case, the commission for making a transfer is like a fine imposed on a dishonest company.) <br>  g) <b>Personal data security, anonymity</b> : no passport data. <br>  h) <b>Independence from hard</b> : it is highly desirable that the system be as cloudy as possible and even better, the extreme option is distributed.  This would eliminate the ‚Äúserver dependency‚Äù, that is, the danger of data loss in case of failure, theft, abuse and other things. <br>  i) <b>Software independence, open-source</b> : a project of this magnitude should be based on open source.  This again is dictated by security considerations, thus preventing abuse by software developers. <br><br>  <b><u>So</u></b> : To create a full-fledged electronic economy in Russia, a system is needed that satisfies the conditions listed above.

    <h4>  What does it mean? </h4><br>  1) We need a website that supports fast and convenient connection of offline enterprises [4], with synchronization via XML and an online store. <br>  2) Need a payment system: decentralized and anonymous. <br><br><h4>  What we have? </h4><br>  1) Prototype sites already exist.  Consider a few. <br>  - <b>Yandex.Market</b> [5]: a beautiful and functional solution - but to fully meet our needs, it lacks a simple mechanism for engaging offline enterprises.  Yandex.Market works with any company that has its own website: "Any store that has a website can place its offers on Yandex.Market." [6] - but does not offer anything for online sales. <br>  - <b>Google Checkout</b> [7]: we consider it solely out of respect for Google, since this service is not available in Russia.  [eight] <br>  - <b>Advertising directories (list.mail.ru, bis077.ru, tiptop.su, showbrand.ru, finatica.ru and others)</b> : the abundance of options does not correct the main <b>thing,</b> namely: the lack of a mechanism for engaging in the online trading of offline enterprises. <br>  In addition, based on the personal impression of the author, who had a conversation with the director of one of the leaders among advertising directories, it can be argued that the involvement of offline enterprises in Internet sales is not part of their long-range plans. <br>  2) The only acceptable option: BitCoin.  Keeping in mind a number of correctable system flaws (they were written about earlier: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/infosecurity/122935">How the bitcoin network will be destroyed (practical tips with examples)</a> ), do not forget about its ‚Äúinborn‚Äù positive properties: decentralization, anonymity, low commissions.  In addition, it should be noted that BitCoin is open-source, which further increases its value in our eyes. <br><br>  <b><u>Conclusion</u></b> : Without a mechanism for engagement, none of the listed companies will achieve notable success in creating a full-fledged e-economy in Russia - and this is confirmed by the current state of things: Russia still does not have an e-economy. <br><br>  <b>Judge for yourself:</b> <b><br></b>  <b>- Gross Domestic Product of Russia for 2010 is approximately 44,939.2 billion rubles.</b>  <b>[9]</b> <b><br></b>  <b>- The turnover of e-commerce for 2011 (forecast) is about 18.2 billion rubles.</b>  <b>[ten]</b> <b><br></b>  <b>This means that the share of Internet sales in the country's total GDP is equal - just imagine!</b>  <b>- 0.04%!</b> <br><br>  <b><u>Answer</u></b> : Based on the Conclusion, we conclude that the creation of the e-economy in Russia is our task, our hands. <br><br><h4>  How? </h4><br>  Here is the prescription: <br>  - We take a flexible and ‚Äúdeeply customizable‚Äù CMS, and better CMF. <br>  - We provide synchronization of the Directory with 1C via XML. <br>  - Turn on accepting BitCoin payments. <br>  - Attracting Sellers to place goods in the Catalog and Buyers - to sell them these goods. <br>  That's all you need to start. <br><br><h4>  Practice </h4><br>  Read about the fate of the project that used this recipe a bit later in the Startups section: it turns out that there are pitfalls along the way, forcing a sharp change of course ... <br><br><h4>  Notes </h4><br>  1. Hereinafter, the Catalog is a system that satisfies the listed conditions. <br>  2. Just look at <a href="http://www.google.ru/">the search results for the e-economy query</a> - emptiness! <br>  3. <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25AD%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D1%258D%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0">Article "Electronic Economy" in Wikipedia</a> <br>  4.
