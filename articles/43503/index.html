Anyway, I‚Äôve been doing web development for quite a few 5 years, but, unfortunately, I don‚Äôt think that I‚Äôve achieved a lot during this time and I rate my level as average.  The main focus in PHP, I think that I know it well, but in the PLO so far it‚Äôs not like a fish in water, although I try to improve myself in this and plan and constantly replenish my knowledge. <br><br><h4>  The essence of the problem. </h4><br>  The fact is that there are always a lot of tasks, but not enough time.  Often you need to add functionality to sites that work without any CMS at all, or with a very conventional management system.  It turns out how you sit and think about the structure / logic of a simple script, you start writing, debugging - everything seems to be ok.  You do everything on time, but at the end, the client usually wants some corrections and has to put all sorts of crutches in an emergency mode, breaking the original structure that does not imply such an extension, and thereby producing a lot of bydlokod. <br>  And so, from time to time - the experience is growing, I am doing more and more flexible and more scalable scripts, but still the feeling that something is wrong does not leave. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Statement of a question. </h4><br>  Since we constantly have to perform standard and single-type actions: <i>write interfaces for adding / editing records to the database, working with forms, creating and outputting content</i> , a reasonable thought is born - ‚ÄúYou can use tools that will save my time and energy spent on the implementation of these tasks ".

      But here, in general, two options: <br><ol><li>  Write your "bike" </li><li>  Use existing practices </li></ol><br>  The second option is now more rational for me, although the first one also has its advantages, in the form of accumulation of experience. <br>  Yes, there are frameworks, but those that I know are too monstrous, and within my tasks it will look like a cannon on sparrows.  I need a small toolkit so that it is not difficult, and it is not expensive to use it to implement simple functionality, and that in the end it was a <b>flexible and high-quality code</b> . <br><br>  That is, I have two goals: <br><ol><li>  Time saving </li><li>  The use of funds that, one way or another, would oblige to monitor the quality of the code (or, simply, by their simplicity, excluded the creation of a bydlokod, there are many options) </li></ol><br>  I ask the Habrasoobschestvo to give good advice on this topic. <br><br><h4>  The essence of the post. </h4><br>  I understand that such questions were raised, in one form or another, on Habr√© more than once, but I would like to collect more information and, as a fee for attention, collect it all in one good and high-quality post. <br><br>  Thank. <br>  ps: on the topic of ‚Äúformation and output of content‚Äù - everything seems to be clear, we must look in the direction of template engines, of which, fortunately, there is more than one post on Habr√©, but if you have something to say, then I will be happy to hear. <br>  pps: so far there is little experience in writing posts, so I apologize for some confusion. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/43503/">https://habr.com/ru/post/43503/</a></p>
