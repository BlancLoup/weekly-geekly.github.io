This statement was made today, and from it it became known that someone had received unauthorized access to the Nintendo server in the United States, but no data was stolen, and the server itself, and Nintendo services were not affected. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  According to a statement made by the same Nintendo representative, neither corporate nor personal data was affected.  As you can see, only now it became known that not only Sony was subjected to attacks by hackers.  True, with respect to Sony, a separate conversation, as the company suffered very, very seriously as a result of the attacks, while Nintendo does not seem to have serious problems.

      It may well be that the Nintendo servers were not of particular interest to hackers, while the Sony servers were a very attractive target for hacking.  After making one successful attack, the Sony servers responsible for the operation of various services attacked again and again.  Now all this is more like the action "Hack Sony server and tell the whole world about it." <br><br>  I would like to hope that Sony will come to his senses, but now this company is still learning to protect its servers in the way the situation and the Internet community demands.  Yes, and I would like to see other companies reliably protect the data of their users.  As we see, after the hackers sensed the "smell of blood", the Sony server, as it turned out, was not so hard to hack.  I wonder if the same massive attacks were carried out on Facebook servers, or would Google have withstood protection? <br><br>  Via <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20110605/ap_on_hi_te/as_japan_nintendo_data_breach">yahoo</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/120627/">https://habr.com/ru/post/120627/</a></p>
