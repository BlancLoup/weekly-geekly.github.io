We are here and continue to write insights from the life of the kubish.ru Cashback service, which allows you to get a cashback in more than 2,000 online stores.  In this post we will tell about a trip to Silicon Valley in June of this year, share the results for the whole three months (May-July) of our service, and also conduct analytics through two channels of attraction: Habr and VK, through which we have a question to indifferent readers. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <i>Previous reports can be found here:</i> <i><br></i> <ul><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/cloverr/blog/248057/">1 month</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/cloverr/blog/10584/">2 month</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/cloverr/blog/11462/">3 month</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/cloverr/blog/14606/">4 month</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/cloverr/blog/15908/">5 month</a> </li></ul><br><br>  Although our company is based in Silicon Valley, most of the team is located in the CIS, because it is economically feasible, as well as significant growth goes exactly here.  A trip to the Valley allows you to see the latest trends, refresh acquaintances with other entrepreneurs, recharge your batteries.

      In June, we attended a significant part of events in Silicon Valley, some of which were organized by ourselves. <br><br>  <b>1. SVOD</b> <br>  <a href="http://www.svod.org/">SVOD</a> (Silicon Valley Open Doors) is an annual conference where very interesting people from the Valley and the CIS always join. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/316/0d2/ae3/3160d2ae302f4945b8efca3ac34aeecc.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/efb/af8/60e/efbaf860ec0143b3b8fc7e5a4c82d0df.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dfa/5f5/1c2/dfa5f51c24824c999eefe5daafb9885d.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a59/cce/e00/a59ccee009574352b40cdc7c3c74d0c2.jpg"><br><br>  The conference never ceases to delight in its scope and quality of the audience.  If next June you are in the Valley, be sure to go to the next one. <br><br>  <b>2. Private parties</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9f5/956/c74/9f5956c74b7b4f27b68c838db2f829d1.jpg"><br><br>  <b>3. Own events</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9cd/7d1/7e9/9cd7d17e9da044e4a3f50e1525104ce6.jpg"><br><br>  <b>4. Meeting with friends and partners</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2a3/493/ab8/2a3493ab84e149379ca886258353efcd.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ecf/dbd/830/ecfdbd8301014a578e33e7a51c3da6cc.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9c1/8dd/8cb/9c18dd8cbd9a4630a910c6cc3df704ed.jpg"><br><br>  <b>5. Hiking to big companies like NASA</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e73/ba6/c37/e73ba6c37b7c41a695c11bd17e81097e.jpg"><br><br>  For a month in the Valley managed to meet with a very large number of old friends, new friends.  Some of our friends received investments from $ 1.5 to $ 20 million, with whom it was very pleasant to talk.  We received a positive feedback on the project, as well as several commitments on investments.  On the one hand, we are doing a sustainable business that is growing every month, as the report below will testify; on the other hand, investors from the Valley are more interested in ‚Äúclubs‚Äù of growth, which grow exponentially and often even without profit.  We still hold on without external investments, as many advise, in order not to give a share ahead of time, but we also continue to accept partnership proposals that can be sent here: alp@clovrr.ru <br><br>  However, let us return to the company's report, this time for the whole three months (May-July 2015). <br><br>  <b>1. Attendance</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/70c/a71/c79/70ca71c792314706bc0e80b4e09b3cb8.png"><br><br>  For three months, we were visited by 14516 unique users, when in February there were more than 18 thousand people in one month.  This is easily explained by the fact that we almost do not pour money into paid traffic. <br><br>  <b>2. Registrations</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e5b/31b/be7/e5b31bbe7f584c4c875b4e247738c972.png"><br><br>  Despite the decrease in attendance, the dynamics of growth of registered users remained at an average of 10% per month, which is explained by a good understanding of the customers of the service, as well as an understandable referral program.  We have 4110 registered users at the end of July. <br><br>  <b>3. Referrals</b> <br>  The number of referrals is 1010, which is 24.5%. <br><br>  <b>4. Shopping</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/024/419/6c1/0244196c162f43b68be544060c612ea4.png"><br><br>  The dynamics of purchases became even higher and reached 300 purchases per month and 1,412 purchases for all the time.  Over the last month, 27% of all purchases of previous periods were made. <br><br>  <b>5. Revenue</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cee/c35/373/ceec3537355c4fa18816db73a8105e8f.png"><br><br>  Revenues for the three months amounted to 67021 rubles.  It is too early to talk about self-sufficiency, but we are moving smoothly in this direction. <br><br>  <b>6. Revenue by user cohorts</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a2a/a42/b79/a2aa42b795734b27b9a736642f599965.png"><br><br>  It can be seen that revenue is distributed across all cohorts and the share of new users in the last month is only 12%, while the share in revenue of the most distant cohort (December) is 14%, which indicates a fairly low Churn Rate. <br><br>  <b>7. Number of active clients</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/389/8c7/6cc/3898c76cc00f4acfad020af19e4980e1.png"><br><br>  <b>8. Number of clients by cohort</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9d2/814/6a6/9d28146a6ca147cab20cab4c99088100.png"><br><br>  <b>9. Gross profit per registered user</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9da/c90/935/9dac909358694c9d92ac34c537deb3bd.png"><br><br>  <b>10. Cumulative gross profit per registered user</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f3e/848/3dd/f3e8483dd17243e490c29a560d25ad85.png"><br><br>  We see that with each month each registered user brings us more and more profits.  And now the promised question on filling: <br><br>  <b>Comparison of users from Habr and VK</b> <br>  We launched an active advertising campaign in VK from March 1, 2015 and invest all free earned money in this channel of attraction.  The mechanics are very simple: we show advertisements to people who subscribe to the groups we set up.  On the other hand, we are keeping the account on Habr√© in the old manner in the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/cloverr/blog/248057/">concept of openness</a> we have indicated.  Therefore, the results of comparison of users from VK and Habr (Habr + Megamind) are lower.  We consider only the period from March 1 to July 31, 2015: <br><br>  <b>1. Registrations</b> <br>  VK: 340 new registrations. <br>  Habr: 146 users. <br>  It seems that the result of VC is better by 57%, but let's go further and see how many referrals have come in each of the channels. <br><br>  <b>2. Registration with referrals</b> <br>  VK: 350 users.  It turns out that the referral users came only 10. <br>  Habr: 304 users.  158 referrals came from Habr (304-146). <br>  So far, VC still wins in absolute amount by 13%, but let's look at the revenue. <br><br>  <b>3. Revenue users without referrals</b> <br>  VK: 1336.11 rubles <br>  Habr: 9575.61 rubles <br>  Habr wins more than 7 times. <br><br>  <b>4. User revenue with referrals</b> <br>  VK: 1360.11 rubles.  Referrals given by users from VK earned 24 rubles. <br>  Habr: 11972.64 rubles.  Referrals earned 2397.03 rubles. <br>  Habr exceeds VK almost 9 times. <br><br>  Our conclusion is that on Habr√© and Megamind a very cool and solvent audience that regularly makes purchases on the Internet and actively advises the service they like to their friends.  And what conclusion would you make?  We will be happy to answer in the comments, or simply register in the <a href="http://kubish.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg%26utm_medium%3Dlink%26utm_content%3Dfooter%26utm_campaign%3D3hmesyachn%26utm_term%3D3hmesyachn">cashback service kubish.ru</a> , to get a piece of money from purchases in any online stores. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/293898/">https://habr.com/ru/post/293898/</a></p>
