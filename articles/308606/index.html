    <h3>  Psychology </h3><br>  Over the past couple of years, I have spent a lot of time negotiating with clients in different roles.  When you have 5-6 meetings a week with potential clients or partners, the brain learns very quickly.  The most important thing that I learned from these lessons was that I learned to force the interlocutor to do something I need, either to draw the most terrible or the most pleasant picture in his head from his point of view.  Some call it ‚Äúsophistry‚Äù.  Now it sounds strange and not clear, but perhaps, I will show with examples what this means. <br><br>  When I ask: <br><br><blockquote>  Vasya, I hope the camera works, otherwise my last experience led to the fact that the video was recorded, but there was no sound.  What do you think I will do next time if it turns out that the sound or video is lost? <br>  Are there designers who would like to try to make landing pages? </blockquote><br>  When I asked the first question ‚ÄúVasya, what do you think I will do if the camera does not write‚Äù - then the <b>most terrible picture</b> from his point of view that he can imagine was <b>drawn</b> in his head at that moment.  Moreover, I do not know what exactly he presented there, how much he is afraid of me or not.  But the fact that he was a little scared - that's for sure. <br><br>  When I asked the second question about the web designers, I <b>sowed hope in your heads</b> .  It seemed to you that there is a vacancy that you can ask about it.  Although pay attention, I obviously did not say that.  But you thought so. <br><br>  Look at the reaction of people to the announcement: at the event in iHUB Chernigiv we called the topic ‚ÄúHow we took the TOP in 2 days‚Äù.  All SEOs pounced on comment, check our sites.  Technically, I did not lie, but did not finish it either: I did not say which site, in what way, when.  This is what the power of the word means. <br><br>  <b>The behavior of people is almost the same and predictable.</b> <br><br>  Imagine that I take a glass and drop it on the floor.  What will happen?  It breaks.  What will happen next?  It will be necessary to remove it, etc., the chain of events will start.  And you may not believe it, but the chain will be the same for almost everyone. <br><br>  Do an experiment: come home and break a glass on the floor in the kitchen.  I can say right now what you will do: go to the pantry, take a scoop and a broom and go clean up, throw it into the trash bin that is under your sink.  Your behavior will be predictable. <br><br>  These were examples that show how a simple phrase or action can influence a person: what he will think and what he will do.  Remember this story, it will be key in our mosaic today. <br><br><h3>  Issue personalization </h3><br>  Have you noticed that sometimes you enter a high-frequency query into the search engine, and the search engine gives you a site in the top that is not even a site?  For example, a couple of years ago, if you enter the query ‚Äúbuilding materials Kiev‚Äù then in the TOP-3 there was an epicenter site.  More precisely, not even the site, for the stub: the logo of the epicenter and contacts.  And no SEO texts, no title is written.  Just a clumsy cap, and it is in the TOP. <br><br>  Do you know why this is happening?  Because if a very large number of people enter ‚Äúbuilding materials the epicenter‚Äù, ‚Äúbuy the epicenter,‚Äù and so on, requests per day.  These requests are a mixture of high-frequency and branded ones.  That is, they introduce what they want, and add to this the name of the brand, in our case the epicenter.  And the search engine somewhere in their connection makes that building materials and the epicenter are related, or synonyms, or similar.  This is a kind of projection of personalized issue. <br><br>  What I want to say is that there is another factor that everyone neglected: this is <b>how much people are searching for your brand on the Internet.</b> <br><br>  What do you think is the difference between your company and Apple in terms of marketing?  Yes, Apple is at the hearing, they are being talked about, but not about you.  So, the essence of any PR campaign is <b>to make people talk about you</b> .  Because at first they talk about you, and then you have clients.  Not the opposite, as it seems to everyone.  Famous brands Apple, Audi, ... - they are very much looking for and discussing.  In the beginning it is created artificially.  Apple fans see positive posts about Apple, haters - see negative.  People see what they want, the issue is somehow personalized almost everywhere. <br><br><h3>  Mass mailing </h3><br>  A couple of years ago, I decided to deal with mass mailing services.  I looked SendPulse, UniSender and similar.  Cool stuff, a lot of things allow. <br><br>  But there is one nuance that does not allow good use of such services in mailing lists ‚Äúfor heating‚Äù: when mailing to you comes through MailChimp, SendPulse and the like, you understand that.  You scam it.  Because the letter is beautifully designed, because there is a signature at the bottom, because there is a link to unsubscribe at the bottom, an HTML letter. <br><br>  And imagine that I will write a letter to you: I will open my email client and just write ‚Äúhello, when can we call you?‚Äù.  It will be a regular text letter, there will be no tracking pixels in it, it will be from an ordinary person, and it will arrive exactly at the moment when I send it.  It does not burn.  People are not fools, they understand when it‚Äôs a mass mailing, and when it‚Äôs an individual letter. <br><br>  Two years ago, we decided to conduct an experiment, and on the New Year all customers were sent such a letter automatically: <br><br><blockquote>  Hello, &lt;customer name&gt;! <br>  Happy New Year, bla bla bla. <br>  Regards, &lt;name of manager&gt; </blockquote><br>  A plain text letter, the sender was the manager's box, which last communicated with the client.  Such a letter seemed individual.  It did not seem spam.  And we received a lot of positive feedback and ‚Äúthanks for the congratulations.‚Äù <br><br><h3>  ‚ÄúGoogling‚Äù </h3><br>  Previously, our product was not searched at all.  Neither the phrase OneBox nor the phrase CRM-system.  We just put it on the market and we had to do something about it. <br><br>  Two years ago, we collected a database of designers, programmers and layout designers.  About 100,000 people.  Name, email.  For six months I did not know what could be done with it.  But at some point it dawned on me how you can play just an incredible multi-path, and I was not afraid to use it. <br><br>  Since at that moment we had our own hosting provider, our own mail servers, we did not experience any problems with the delivery of letters at the right time.  I counted: <br><br><ul><li>  This is 100,000 letters per month. </li><li>  In the month of 25 working days </li><li>  That is, you need to send 4000 letters per day </li><li>  One employee is able to send about 20 letters per hour, only 8 working hours per day </li><li>  It turns out that you need about 25 employees. </li><li>  That is, such a mailing will be real if it will be sent by 25 people, 20 letters per hour each. </li></ul><br>  And we did it. <br><br>  Inside OneBox there is a special functionality of ‚ÄúPlanned Mailings‚Äù, which once per hour for a given group of contacts from through real SMTP server, through real mailboxes of employees sends N emails per hour.  Regular text letters.  (Initially, the functionality was designed not to send subscribers all at once, because the support and call center covers). <br><br>  The text of the letter was something like this: <br><br><blockquote>  Hello, &lt;name&gt;! <br>  We are looking for an interface designer.  Our product is a OneBox CRM system.  This is a complex product on 3000 screens. <br>  Tell me, do you do such designs? <br>  Thank. </blockquote><br>  And most importantly - <b>we did not leave contacts in the letter</b> .  At all.  Unless it was possible to respond to the letter. <br><br>  <b>When you are offered a job, you are looking for an employer site.</b>  The text of the letter was designed so that people copied the phrase ‚ÄúCRM-system OneBox‚Äù and inserted it into Google.  Do you know what this led to?  20 people per hour began to search for our product in search engines.  On the day we received about 1000 visits from SEO for branded queries: weproduction, onebox, crm onebox.  We were looking for. <br><br>  Someone answered the letters, some did not answer, someone asked ‚Äúwhere did you find me from‚Äù.  If a person sent us a letter in response - OneBox formed one of the prepared answers.  That is, our CRM-system talked to a large number of people itself, and they did not even understand.  Behavior is predictable, it is clear who and what will ask.  OneBox behaved like an under-HR.  In fact, it was the beginning, because of which we believed that it was possible to automate the correspondence with people - and it was the great-grandfather of OneBox Next. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c07/4e6/0a0/c074e60a0ec64b388712587686d0dec4.png"><br><br>  After 2 days of such a ‚Äúwalk through‚Äù - we were on the 9th place on the first page on Google.  A month later we were in 3rd place.  In fact, we adjusted the personalized issue, and it indirectly affected the issue as a whole.  (The effect lasts for about six months, then falls.) <br><br>  By the way, we not only made a narrow audience look for our product, but also found a couple of smart designers.  And probably a couple of people from the readers just received our newsletter.  The phrase ‚Äúcrm-system‚Äù was not the most successful, it still has little targeted traffic. <br><br><h3>  Epic finish </h3><br>  Making people google our brand is not the most interesting.  In marketing terms, this is called ‚Äúheating.‚Äù  When you are all looking for you, you have a lot more leads (product requests) and you go to the OS, get distracted by customers. <br><br>  The nuance is <b>what you will do next when everyone is looking for you</b> .  Because the audience is heated - they have your brand in their head, they are looking for it, trying to understand why you offered them a job, how did you find out why you are not responding to their letters or are responding strangely, they are expecting something from you.  The question was formulated in such a way that he sowed hope. <br><br>  Next you need to do the "seeding".  One fine day, on Friday at 10:00 pm, we publish viral content on social networks: a screenshot that <b>our system has learned to fire people</b> .  It was a very functional beta curve, it almost did not work normally, it could not even be demonstrated. <br><br>  We are very lucky that several people immediately made reposts.  If this did not happen, it would be necessary to hire someone who has a great deal of contact with our heated audience.  After 2 days, on Monday, we had a coverage of more than 100K, hundreds of reposts, and a distribution to journalists was launched.  We just sent them a link to this post on facebook. <br><br><h3>  results </h3><br>  You saw the results: everyone who wanted and did not want wrote about us. <br>  This promotional campaign has given us: <br><br><ul><li>  lead growth by 5 times, we are simply overwhelmed by those who want to see our product </li><li>  we found designers </li><li>  we are in the top google in the audience we need </li></ul><br>  A couple more facts: <br><br><ul><li>  The company's budget is 0. Although technically, it took a lot of company resources to prepare all this. </li><li>  Do you know how many people burned that this is an artificial virus?  ten. </li><li>  This case is about 1% of the methods that we now use in promoting our product.  There are other ways, but about them another time. </li></ul><br>  Thank you all for your attention! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/308606/">https://habr.com/ru/post/308606/</a></p>
