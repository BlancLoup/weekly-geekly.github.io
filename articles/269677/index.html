An innovative solution is the <a href="http://www.smart-soft.ru/ru/products/StableStream/">Stable Stream</a> transport protocol, a technology for streaming video content over the public Internet channels. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f12/ea3/d77/f12ea3d7764f4f2f8f17f2eff06655a4.jpg" alt="image">

      Below are five stories about how Stable Stream equally successfully helped to solve business problems of varying complexity and a visual demonstration of the transfer of video content. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Links and circuses</b> <br>  <i>How Stable Stream helped attract a million customers to a European mobile operator</i> <br><br>  A large European mobile operator offered additional services to subscribers - rental of movies, music and audio books.  Sometimes the quality of the final picture was lost during transmission over loaded communication channels during peak hours, especially over long distances.  We suggested using the Stable Stream transport protocol to use it to output video content from the broadcast servers to the end mobile devices of the clients.  As a result, the telecom operator was able to consistently transmit content without losing quality to more than a million subscribers. <br><br>  <i>Scheme of delivery of video content to the end user using Stable Stream</i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c7d/b2a/619/c7db2a619f264965a0ede1e217fff497.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Moscow says and shows</b> <br>  <i>How Stable Stream brought a project to sell TV content from Moscow to the regions of Russia</i> <br><br>  A large Russian federal retail chain has launched a project for the sale of legal television content and its online viewing using TV set-top boxes or using mobile devices.  However, during the implementation of the conceived problems arose with the transfer of content from Moscow to the regions, even to not so distant ones (for example, from Moscow to Voronezh).  Data transmission using the sstp protocol made it possible to deliver video content from servers located in Moscow to servers in Voronezh in their original (read - guaranteed high) quality.  As a result, subscribers received a high-quality signal, the retail network improved the quality of the service and lowered the cost of the project. <br><br>  <b>Content delivered to hand</b> <br>  <i>How the Stable Stream protocol helps improve the competitiveness of OTT-TV</i> <br><br>  A European company providing OTT-TV services faced the problem of loss of quality when broadcasting video content to remote world regions.  We suggested using the Stable Stream protocol for unstable Internet connection and organizing the signal transmission from the site to the broadcast server using the Stable Stream protocol.  This made it possible to establish uninterrupted signal transmission and get the original picture quality on the user's end devices.  As a result, the customer company increased the competitiveness of its product and for several months was able to attract more than 5,000 new subscribers. <br><br>  <b>Non-random connections</b> <br>  <i>How to use the Stable Stream protocol to expand the subscriber base of the IPTV operator by one and a half times</i> <br><br>  The Russian regional IPTV operator set out to expand the network and offer its services to subscribers located at a great distance from it and in areas of unstable Internet connection.  However, it was not possible to deliver video content to the consumer in such conditions without loss of quality.  Our specialists used the Stable Stream transport protocol and ensured uninterrupted data transfer, organized a billing system and customer access to a personal account for subscription management.  As a result, the IPTV operator expanded the database of its subscribers by one and a half times - by increasing the coverage area and providing quality services to the end user and significantly saved on network expansion. <br><br>  <b>From Russia with content</b> <br>  <i>How to transmit a television signal from Russia to Asia without a satellite and loss of quality</i> <br><br>  The Asian cable cameraman faced a problem when transferring licensed content from Russia and Europe through open channels.  The signal was delivered without the use of satellite communications, so the quality of the video content at the output was very low, and stable real-time broadcasting was impossible.  To solve the problem, our specialists have created a system for transferring content from broadcast servers in Russia to client end stations in Thailand and other countries of Southeast Asia based on the Stable Stream protocol.  We have not just established an uninterrupted transfer of content to consumers, but also provided the highest quality at the output, not differing from the quality from the original source. <br><br>  In the end, I would like to visually demonstrate the transfer of media content, suppose, from point A to point B <br><br>  Received flows on the client side (point B) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e0e/e37/080/e0ee370807bf4fd69411fa9cfe1551bf.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Monitor in client mode (point B) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c02/077/043/c02077043efe45c29ba937377841bcb6.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Flows that get to point A (server mode) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ce4/01a/fc5/ce401afc56034b758217297295bfda3d.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Tunnels from point A to point B <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f5a/938/164/f5a938164ae94a7e9e72a18007da9241.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>PS</b> If you have any questions or comments - write in the comments, we will answer all!
