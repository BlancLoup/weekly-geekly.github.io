Although this watch does not know how to view sms, but it can pay for your favorite cookies in the store.  So, we will talk about the clock for contactless payment with the power of technology <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/MasterCard_PayPass">PayPass</a> . <br><br>  Under the cut analysis of hours, the pros and cons, "but what if you do ...", a little constructive criticism, and of course a lot of pictures. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Briefly about the device </h3><br>  Recently, I became the proud owner of a <a href="http://watch2pay.com/">Watch 2 Pay</a> watch made by a large Russian bank.  Of course, the name of the bank, I will not tell you, otherwise it will be advertising.  This watch differs from the original only in the presence of the bank's corporate emblem and engraving on the side metal surface.  The rest is a completely original device.  I will not argue about tastes and just briefly say that the design of watches is designed in a strict style and looks decent and high quality.  The natural rubber strap is very pleasant to the touch, it has a standard watch strap, so it can be easily replaced with any other. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/75a/8c4/363/75a8c4363dd94321b391010ae4024b07.png" alt="image"></a>

      The Austrian company <a href="http://www.laks.com/">LAKS has</a> developed this miracle device (well, of course, it is going to be in China).  This idea is <a href="http://www.google.com.tr/patents/US8235586">patented</a> and therefore it is unlikely that you will see a watch from other manufacturers with this functionality in the near future.  Soon we will return to this patent. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/728/9b4/74e/7289b474e7c346438d6c6a05dd99a8ca.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  On the left side of the side panel there is a lid that covers the card insertion compartment. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8b5/46e/4ad/8b546e4ad864423b8c636fc9208976fc.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  The card is made in the form factor of a regular SIM card.  This is MasterCard Standart which is not serviced at an ATM.  But there is a PIN code, and in the kit is attached a second standard MasterCard card with a chip and a magnetic stripe, tied to a common account, for depositing and withdrawing money. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0e9/97c/39b/0e997c39bdf6441d905e54b46acecd87.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br><h3>  Parsing </h3><br>  There are no difficulties with access to the internals of this device - four small screws holding the back cover of the watch open access to a completely standard card reader. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/607/567/f04/607567f047f04ae18cc1470035ddd14a.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  From 10 contacts (8 contacts for reading data from a card and 2 determining the presence / absence of a card) only 8 for reading data are decoupled.  But the surprise was hiding on the back of the board. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fa9/206/fe4/fa9206fe4ca84ce891a00d7c2a8942e9.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  On the printed circuit board along the two main round contacts for the antenna (red) there are two other contact pads (green and blue), although there are no other microcircuits in the case of the clock anymore.  Obviously, we see a groundwork for the future.  Also characteristic is the location of these sites - to the left and to the right of the watch adjustment head.  In the main case inside, under the "green" contact pad, a recess of square shape is retracted, and under the "blue" - a hole in the plastic case up to the outer metal insert. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/44d/0ec/f7f/44d0ecf7f30b4b8d89d978223e0d8111.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  Following common sense, we can assume the connection of a microcontroller for additional functions.  It's time to look at the patent.  And indeed in paragraph 9 of the patent formula, we see the possibility of connecting external devices via USB.  The second hole prepared apparently intended for the LED indicator.  Correlating the patent and what was seen as a result of opening the device, we can assume a large reserve for the future, since the internal space is practically not used and it is even possible to install additional microcontrollers or even a battery inside. <br><br>  The main thing in parsing is not to lose the two springs located on the contacts of the external antenna (marked in red). <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Springs</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Micro USB next to them seems just awesome. <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9b3/136/718/9b31367189a84667b09749b4ff53dde5.png" alt="image"></a> <br></div></div><br><h3>  Criticism </h3><br><ul><li>  The PayPass technology itself is theoretically vulnerable and it is possible to steal data from a card without contact, imperceptible to you, and as a result the card is cloned.  From this, it would seem, a simple and obvious precaution is to make a small toggle switch / button to turn on the external antenna in the clock (when you need to touch and pay, turn on when there is no need to keep the clock passive).  But the manufacturer left a lot of free space and did not do it. <br><br></li><li>  When conducting an operation up to 1000 rubles (in some terminals), there is no authorization in the payment system and a PIN code request.  Those.  the purchase is literally on parole (by analogy with Imprint for classic cards).  And if such a watch is stolen from you, then the thief will be able to pay for purchases in stores (no more than 1000 rubles at a time) before the expiry of the card without the threat of being caught. <br><br></li><li>  Since the card is not serviced at an ATM, you cannot change the PIN code of such a card in a standard way. </li></ul><br><h3>  "What if you do ..." </h3><br><ol><li>  Since the chip from the card is standard, you can insert it into the ATM in order to change the pin code.  This will require a piece of plastic of a suitable shape and some glue (the card from which the flash drive was ‚Äúbroken out‚Äù is available).  The truth is, in the event of an emergency situation at an ATM, then it will take a long time to explain to the bank employees why it was done. <br><br></li><li> With the help of the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.nxp.taginfolite%26hl%3Dru">NFC TagInfo</a> program and an <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.nxp.taginfolite%26hl%3Dru">NFC-enabled</a> phone, some information was read.  It most likely does not represent useful information, but it gives an opportunity to think about what kind of information the map stores. <br>  Also, the user <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/kraleksandr/" class="user_link">kraleksandr</a> suggested an interesting <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.github.devnied.emvnfccard">application</a> for reading data from such cards (including data on the latest transactions).  This card does not provide storage of recent transactions. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Screenshots</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f71/6b1/f67/f716b1f670544503b1aece5e08f622df.png" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eef/ca6/28a/eefca628ab5341a6ab07669dcd90f7b6.png" alt="image"><br></div></div><br></li><li>  Of course, I myself want to pick up a drill with a drill, a soldering iron and drill a small hole under the button to open the antenna circuit.  But this is probably the next time. </li></ol></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/375479/">https://habr.com/ru/post/375479/</a></p>
