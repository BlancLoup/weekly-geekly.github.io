In this area, applications and services interact with a person on an intuitive level, helping to live and work. <br><br>  Watson Analytics is a tool that provides advanced analytics, free from unnecessary complexity.  Data is collected and processed in the cloud, structured and provided in a readable form.  It uses predictive analysis, graphical tools and everything else that may be needed.  In the sequel - 8 examples of how <a href="http://www.ibm.com/analytics/watson-analytics/">IBM Watson Analythics</a> helps to change the efficiency of companies for the better. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Predictive models.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/428/b69/f80/428b69f80d164908ab82514496e1be0d.jpg"><br><br>  Paschall Truck Lines is a freight transportation company.  The company uses Watson Analytics to identify factors that affect staff turnover.  Prognostic models created with the help of a cognitive system, allow you to avoid problems with the staff before they appear.  In addition, when recruiting new drivers, Paschall Truck Lines analyzes their experience, work history and other things to help them understand what kind of person they are. <br>  All this allows you to maintain a balance of labor and not have problems due to lack of personnel. <br><br><h3>  Mear group </h3><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c4f/fd6/989/c4ffd69896054f8a94e5278bffb0a407.jpg"><br><br>  Mears Group is a major provider of healthcare services in the UK.  She is now using analytics from IBM to analyze reports of injuries to company employees, and the results of research are used to improve labor protection measures at enterprises.  Currently, the company‚Äôs database contains more than 600 million records, all of which are added to the system thanks to IBM, analyzed and structured. <br><br>  Analysis of the data made it possible to understand in which sphere and at what time unreasonably many injuries of workers occur.  Now this information is used by the company's clients to introduce additional security measures, which allows reducing the number of injuries of employees at workplaces.  Moreover, Watson Analytics helped determine the strategy for shaping the company's security policy for the next year. <br><br><h3>  Minter ellison </h3><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/747/9ef/acd/7479efacdb754ca2a5df1104947f41de.jpg"><br><br>  Minter Ellison, one of the largest law firms in the Asia-Pacific region, uses IBM analytics to identify new business opportunities.  At the entrance to the system - the financial data of the Australian Stock Exchange, mainly - customer data.  At the exit - information about the dependencies between the decrease in the level of customer profits and the cessation of growth in certain areas (industry, medicine, financial institutions, etc.).  The Watson Analitycs service helped to identify the most profitable and fast-growing areas, which allowed us to more effectively interact with customers, increasing the profitability of their investments. <br><br><h3>  Caliber Patient Care </h3><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/974/613/bc5/974613bc540b42759a9771bc866e9c86.jpg"><br><br>  Another health care company is Caliber Patient Care.  It provides transportation services for patients.  This is a professional transportation of passengers who are hospital patients.  Clients are helped to move from home to hospitals, hospices, sanatoriums.  Drivers of the company pass about 150 thousand kilometers every month, collecting data about each trip. <br>  Watson Analitycs processes this data and determines the optimal directions and trajectories of vehicles.  As a result, the work is carried out by drivers more efficiently, the number and duration of downtime has decreased, and profit growth has noticeably accelerated.  By the end of the year, the company hopes to get $ 750,000 more than last year. <br><br><br><h3>  Kristalytics </h3><br>  Kristalytics, a marketing and analytical company, works with Watson Analytics to conduct consumer behavioral analysis and build customized reports with data visualization for their customers.  Thus, the company identifies the main trends in the market and helps its customers keep up with the times. <br>  Watson Analytics, using data such as age and gender of consumers, as well as working with proprietary data of the company, helped one of Kristalytics clients find out that the focus was on customers - women.  With a male audience work was carried out, but not too active.  As a result, it was the men who did not buy the client‚Äôs goods too eagerly.  Now, after correcting the problem, both men and women are equally interested in the products of this company. <br><br><h3>  Legends </h3><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9bf/ba7/c84/9bfba7c848bb410b93c99deedbf5eec1.jpg"><br><br>  Legends organizes sports events for both professional teams and amateurs.  Watson Analytics helped the company improve its work and increase the efficiency of interaction with customers, with data being analyzed in real time.  It is quite difficult to organize any more or less large-scale competition, a championship or even a friendly meeting of sports teams - very much affects the time and place of such an event.  Injuries to athletes, ticket sales, terrain, weather conditions - this is only a small fraction of such factors. <br><br>  Identifying the links between event attendance, weather conditions, venue and other data, Legends identified the main success factors for such events.  And now the efficiency of the company has increased significantly.  Accordingly, increased profits. <br><br><h3>  Iowa state university </h3><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0cb/54b/de2/0cb54bde2ada481ca24d03f934e01b68.jpg"><br><br>  The university, with the help of Watson Analytics, conducted a series of classes for students, teaching them to use data from Twitter and other social networks to make more informed decisions about sales proposals for various products and product lifecycle management.  Students received a vivid example of working with Big Data - data from hundreds of millions of microblogging services.  The information was used by students to make changes in the launched marketing campaigns in real time. <br><br><br><h3>  University of Memphis </h3><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c77/ea0/70a/c77ea070a8d1462dbded918d7bcc52c0.jpg"><br><br>  Hundreds of university students use Watson Analytics as a tool for teaching business intelligence skills.  In particular, students learn how to work with Watson Analytics during the course ‚ÄúCritical Thinking and Project Management‚Äù.  The course gives students the opportunity to see the effectiveness of analytical tools for working with business projects. <br><br>  As you can see, <b>IBM Watson Analytics</b> is a universal service that is capable of analyzing huge amounts of corporate data, identifies links between various factors, and ranks them according to the degree of their impact on business efficiency.  Using this information, any company can increase the efficiency of its work, and very significantly.  The service can be used not only by business units, but also by scientific organizations, administrative structures, as well as interested persons from a large number of different industries. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/392375/">https://habr.com/ru/post/392375/</a></p>
