The number of daily working 3D-printers and machines is constantly growing.  The same can be said about robotics, equipment for three-dimensional scanning and vacuum casting. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/g7/ts/d1/g7tsd1u6xuckkoqecwcvmfxchcs.jpeg"><br><br>  Like any technically sophisticated equipment, all these devices need maintenance, repair and upgrade.  In this article, we describe how the service of the service of Russia's largest 3D printing and engineering company Top 3D Shop works.

    <div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/v2/oq/5p/v2oq5pafphfs8ahqnjhc7nhsp5w.jpeg"></div><br><h3>  How does this happen </h3><br>  For maintenance, the client contacts his problem with technical support, by mail at supportmsk@top3dshop.ru or by phone 8 (499) 322-23-19.  In the course of communication, information about the printer is requested, as well as a description, photo and video of the malfunction - to provide primary advice on its elimination.  Often it is possible to troubleshoot even during the consultation.  This is convenient - the client does not need to carry his equipment anywhere. <br><br>  If the equipment still needs qualified repair, it is possible to order the necessary spare part from a remote warehouse in advance, find out the approximate timing of diagnostics and repair. <br><br>  Upon receipt of the equipment by the service center, an acceptance certificate is issued, which will need to be presented upon receipt. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ak/v2/tk/akv2tk8bjck1qakwqway_vaaotk.jpeg"><br><br>  Diagnosis is carried out within three days after receipt, in some cases a little longer.  After the diagnosis, if the repair is warranty, it starts immediately. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gr/e_/2t/gre_2tdlana2susvil5cxzljnhy.jpeg"><br><br>  If the guarantee is over, or the equipment was purchased not from us, which is also often the case, the cost (in accordance with the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rY54aU1MTuxal33w3woEhi_3YBxvrCmQTLpEnjre7co/"><b><u>price list</u></b></a> ) and the terms of the repair are agreed with the client.  If the client is satisfied with everything, the service engineer proceeds to repair.  After the repair is completed, a test print is carried out and a statement of the repair work completed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/in/xa/yb/inxaybqcqkp-t5kpdlo9t2snjm4.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  What does service do besides repair </h3><br>  In addition to repairs, the Top 3D Shop service also deals with equipment diagnostics, modification of printers and CNC machines, as well as pre-sales preparation and installation of equipment.  All of this also applies to robotics, 3D scanners and ancillary equipment, such as molders, ultrasonic washers, high-temperature furnaces and vibrating tables, injection molding furnaces and injection molding machines. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rs/gi/qe/rsgiqe6nzlcc46jskx0dv3k7rqe.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  NDP (commissioning) </h3><br>  The service of the Top 3D Shop carries out the commissioning of 3D printers, CNC machines - laser and milling, as well as other equipment supplied by the company. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mu/eh/j9/muehj9lyegodwrvgs8i1g2bljy0.jpeg"><br><br>  Our engineers go to the buyer in order to install the purchased equipment, test its work and train the client in handling it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/eo/rb/gc/eorbgccddgkrajewmwvijk8amb8.jpeg"><br><br>  This service is provided to both individuals and organizations. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/a5/xh/hy/a5xhhyuqrjb0voh8xxn6xdwdeea.jpeg"><br><br>  For example, we recently made a selection of equipment, pre-sale preparation, installation and instruction of client personnel at a factory engaged in the production of electronics for river and sea vessels. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/7w/qv/nf/7wqvnfbxxzjkcjztobeskmurfu4.jpeg"><br><br>  You can read more about this <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/blog/kejs-sla-kulakova/"><b><u>here</u></b></a> . <br><br><h3>  What kind of breakdown you have to face most often </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0l/ua/qm/0luaqmyobp76nqg15nkmf6bd_j8.jpeg"><br><br>  The most common problems associated with the print head: plastic jams in the thermal barrier, clogged nozzles, fusing plastic on the print head, insufficient pinch gear, loosening gear on the motor shaft, temperature sensor malfunctions and so on. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sx/y8/tv/sxy8tv189bdnl5h1ydysc-r5wp4.jpeg"><br><br>  Next come the problems with the belts, the calibration of the table, with the sensors of the end of movement and electronics. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kb/_i/nx/kb_inxelfsq2jpfnnpxwwm819qc.jpeg"><br><br>  As for photopolymer printers, their most frequent problems are related to calibration and resin spillage into the printer body. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/9i/zv/6s/9izv6skvjhehno7mju9r88gujjs.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  What problems may arise during the repair and how they are solved </h3><br>  During the repair, problems may arise with nodes that the customer did not indicate during the printer registration for repair.  For example, they can bring a printer with a completely disassembled print head, or any other failed node, and after its restoration, a malfunction will be revealed with anything else. <br><br>  Before performing repair work, the client is warned that such a situation is possible. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0x/c5/wp/0xc5wpml9ywrnmn1brygfvarlia.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  Do I need to improve my equipment </h3><br>  New printers and machines usually do not require any modifications and work fine out of the box, or after a small initial setup.  People who purchase such equipment want to get results quickly, without wasting time studying the technical part. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kh/va/fi/khvafiutb8x-7v5pl5kije9r_cs.jpeg"><br><br>  RepRap and DIY kits are usually modified, the quality of the components in which often leaves much to be desired, and the assembly by an inexperienced user can lead to malfunctions. <br><br>  The modification allows you to replace or supplement some nodes to improve the operation of the device.  For 3D printers, for example - add a heated table, blow up models, a closed chamber, replace sensors, guides, strengthen the frame, etc., on machines - replace a spindle or laser tube with more powerful ones, add a cooler or compressor more powerful, install optional knots. <br><br>  Sometimes the manufacturer produces additional kits for modification.  Such kits allow you to optimize equipment for specific tasks. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/g1/s9/rt/g1s9rtakh5gdysrhuj0m_p89dpk.jpeg"></div><br><h3>  The simplest and most difficult cases of repair in our practice </h3><br>  The simplest thing that happens is fitting and switching loose or incorrectly connected contacts, replacing components and calibrating the printer. <br><br>  Sometimes, after the elimination of such problems, the problems appear more complicated. <br>  The complex can be attributed to work with printers of unknown origin. <br><br>  Non-standard design solutions, lack of documentation and the use of unknown spare parts make the maintenance of such a printer an interesting but long and laborious quest.  Often, it is necessary to refine the design, functionality and firmware of the printer so that all nodes work correctly. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/e5/vu/3g/e5vu3ge43g--01q2havqzeyggeg.jpeg"></div><br><h3>  Interesting and informative cases </h3><br>  Any complex repair is interesting in terms of experience.  Repair of printers of unknown origin and making improvements to the design of printers - just from this series. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-u/am/tk/-uamtksdrd7v_phhlvjxfx4pky0.jpeg"></div><br><br><h3>  How do Top 3D Shop maintain quality of service? </h3><br>  Any equipment, upon completion of work on it in our service, is calibrated and test printed.  During work, all actions are recorded, which are then recorded in the act of completed work.  There is a photo report - before and after the repair work.  All work and deadlines are negotiated;  if something changes, the new information will be consistent with the client. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/uh/jo/db/uhjodbvlye-szjygubpbi9jxlig.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  How do we improve skills </h3><br>  The company successfully operates a system of initial employee training and advanced training.  We design training programs for all positions, including engineering, in the company's arsenal dozens of current courses, from theoretical to practical. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/m8/xl/dx/m8xldxnw88uzi9a75x0bghiit1u.jpeg"><br><br>  We make sure that our engineers are ready for any problems that customers may have. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/md/dj/o1/mddjo13b-qzpa0accj7wix0a-io.jpeg"><br><br>  Service employees carefully study the new equipment, both independently and in cooperation with suppliers, including at the manufacturer‚Äôs enterprises, where they have the opportunity to communicate with the people who created this equipment. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cd/uh/lr/cduhlrk_jpgjwpmuzkhgv3hlisg.jpeg"><br><br>  Study visits, including abroad, allow not only to study the equipment according to the manufacturer‚Äôs program, but also to personally get acquainted with the developed production culture. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vs/w4/s4/vsw4s4evyx3ohz8bzjgepd_bhyk.jpeg"><br><br>  Last year alone, our engineers went to Germany and Poland, Italy, China and the USA several times to study. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zz/cg/fj/zzcgfj1nwrvak-i99s8ofamoiiw.jpeg"><br><br>  During these trips, we obtained the necessary knowledge of equipment and certification from HP, Omni 3D, Apium and Sinterit, Shining 3D, DWS, and other manufacturers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/oj/5u/gd/oj5ugd5ebhaoqhldvtfvbpk7wjm.jpeg"><br><br>  As part of the training, the engineers familiarized themselves in detail with the products of these companies and considered possible problems and ways to solve them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ix/nf/gt/ixnfgtwolbhcbgjzwact_ez3v38.jpeg"><br><br>  Another plus of such international communication is the opportunity to share experiences, compare approaches.  Not every engineer can boast that he has to work side by side with specialists from other countries.  This communication is useful not only for engineers - the manufacturer itself can receive useful feedback on its product and, possibly, improve something in its design. <br><br><h3>  Advice to owners of 3D printers and CNC machines from our engineers </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kl/kb/43/klkb43_jrwzdzp2teggdlyexouo.jpeg"><br><br>  Like any complex technical device, 3D printers and CNC machines require careful handling and timely maintenance.  It is necessary to monitor the cleanliness of the surface of the working platform, the print head and moving parts, to lubricate and clean in a timely manner.  Observe the rules of operation and safety. <br><br>  Novice users must read the instructions that are attached to the equipment in paper or electronic form or taken on the manufacturer's website.  The manual contains most of the information that will help make the first confident steps in the work. <br><br>  If you did not find the information you need, contact the manufacturer directly, and in case of a breakdown contact the service center, then your printer will work long and productively. <br><br>  Top 3D Shop service is always happy to answer your questions about the repair and maintenance of CNC machines and 3D printers - write to us at supportmsk@top3dshop.ru or call the phone numbers listed on the <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/contacts.html"><b><u>site</u></b></a> . <br><br>  Want more interesting news from the world of 3D technology? <br><br>  <b>Subscribe to us in the social.</b>  <b>networks:</b> <br><br> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/top3dshop/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b25/fce/eff/b25fceeffa904b06ba0818fdef351e77.png"></a> <a href="https://vk.com/top3dshop"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c76/ee9/037/c76ee903753346c29abaa49280dfd828.png"></a> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/top3dshop/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f91/396/101/f91396101d2b4579bb273636bc6283fd.png"></a> <br> <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/925/e7a/3b7/925e7a3b7e02499e833866f3b09f7674.png"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/417895/">https://habr.com/ru/post/417895/</a></p>
