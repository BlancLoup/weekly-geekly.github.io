In this case, I propose an addition to what I saw in the news feeds from freewaresoftware.ru. <br><br>  - <br><br><blockquote>  The company ‚Äú3Klikru‚Äù, representing the international holding Qlikworld BV in Russia, has begun to distribute NewsReader news receiving program.  Now the program can be used free of charge not only by simple readers, but also by site owners. <a name="habracut"></a>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

        </script>
      <br>
      Recall that the presentation of the program in Russia took place in May of this year.  At the same time, the head of Qlikworld's strategic development, Torvald Kik, told Webblanet that this RSS aggregator is intended not for ‚Äúgeeks‚Äù, but for ordinary citizens who are not familiar with the intricacies of working on the Internet.  User NewsReader (actually ‚Äúnews reader‚Äù) lives on the user's computer and allows you to add news feeds to your taste - in particular, from the database of Russian and foreign media, as well as through RSS search (Qlikword has its own search engine Plazoo). <br><br>  More interestingly, Qlikworld NewsReader allows companies and online communities to create their own websites with RSS feeds on a given topic for a certain circle of their readers / employees.  The creator of the site can customize your site-translator for various types of multimedia content.  In addition to text / photo / audio / video, it can be information about the movement of mail, information about tickets to offline events, etc. <br><br>  In this case, NewsReader becomes something like a ‚Äúnews CMS‚Äù.  And community members or company employees get a branded news reader.  In this case, the site publisher receives statistics on the number of installed and used readers, the most readable news, as well as gender and age of users. <br><br>  It was originally planned that only the NewsReader user reader would be distributed free of charge, and companies would pay for installing their own services and translators.  This is how Qlickworld works in the West, earning money from a licensing service, as well as advertising in it. <br><br>  However, the other day, Andrei Rastolny, Deputy General Director of the company ‚Äú3Klik.ru‚Äù, told ‚ÄúWebplanet‚Äù that now the concept has been changed - the program has become free on the Runet not only for end users, but for website owners interested in distributing their information on the Internet: <br><br>  ‚ÄúInitially, we planned to earn money by selling the right to distribute the program under our brand to various resources and use their management system capabilities, but now we decided to receive income only from the sale of advertising space in the program.  Due to this, we comply with the trilateral benefit: users get the program for free, website owners get all the features of the management system and a branded reader for free, and we earn money from advertising that we show in readers, ‚Äùsays Andrey Rastolny. <br><br>  An already working example of NewsReader in Runet can be viewed on the Euro-football.ru website.  In the West, Qlikworld BV holding operates in eleven European countries.  The NewsReader service is used on the sites of the DHL postal service and the RTL channel, as well as on several European sports sites.  More information about the work of the service, and in particular, about how to deal with high loads, you can read in an interview with Torvald Quick. <br>  peeped on <a href="http://freewaresoftware.ru/%3Fcat%3D15">freewaresoftware.ru/?cat=15</a> </blockquote><br><br>  - <br><br>  From myself I can add only that 3klik turned around in earnest.  I know about projects not by hearsay.  Well, the Big Ship is a great swimming ... you can download the program for testing here: <a href="http://in-web.kz/%3Fp%3D437">in-web.kz</a> or in any other place.  On the Internet there are already many advanced companies that have adopted.  I met on: Moskovsky Komsomolets, Odnoklassniki, Comedy Club, Spartak Football Club, <a href="http://www.fd-service.kz/">www.fd-service.kz</a> , <a href="http://www.rss-reader.kz/">www.rss-reader.kz</a> , <a href="http://www.3klik.kz/">www.3klik.kz</a> and many, many, many more.  search, use, ship. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/28894/">https://habr.com/ru/post/28894/</a></p>
