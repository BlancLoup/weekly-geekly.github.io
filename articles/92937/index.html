The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe project intersects with <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/i_am_advertising/76993/">Avto-Imkho announced on Habr√© on December 2, 2009</a> , but we were not even aware of it. <br><br>  The project is only a week long, and its attendance now covers the indicators of the ‚Äúoriginal idea‚Äù, despite the fact that at this stage this is a local implementation of a relatively small city (350 thousand people).  I want to tell you how it all turned out in comparison with Avto-IMHO. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d77/f24/850/d77f248502f22040b31174589305db71.jpg" alt="image">

      The essence of the project ‚ÄúFeedback on drivers‚Äù is that every driver and pedestrian in the country can share impressions with other drivers about what is happening on city roads.  Very often one has to deal with traffic violations or obvious rudeness on the roads.  It happens, I want to thank the correct and polite driver, on drive.s13.ru this can also be done. <br><br>  The project is social and is designed primarily to improve the culture of behavior on the roads of the country due to the fact that people will give marks to themselves, and they themselves will respond to criticism and praise in their address.  It was declared from the very beginning, with this we went to the local traffic police, where we received support. <br><br>  As a result, the Grodno State Traffic Inspectorate has already connected to the project, information about traffic jams, traffic jams, repair of certain sections of roads, promotions and traffic police activities in the region began to appear.  Also punished and the first unfortunate drivers who received fines for violating the rules of parking based on the project.  But the most important thing is that while we are deliberately not going to go beyond Grodno. <br><br>  Despite the fact that the potential audience is an order of magnitude smaller than that enjoyed by Avto-Imkho, success (weekly attendance of up to 1,300 unique users per day) lies precisely in it.  In such projects, ‚Äúparochialism‚Äù plays a very large role - it is much more interesting for people to find out what happens next to them than with someone else in another city. <br><br>  The project ‚ÄúFeedback on drivers of Belarus‚Äù was born from several topics on the most popular forum in the region.  These are ‚ÄúFreaks on the Roads‚Äù, ‚ÄúI Park Like an Idiot‚Äù and ‚ÄúAccidents‚Äù.  In fact, drive.s13.ru is a battery of all these themes, plus a small amount of ‚Äúoff load‚Äù functionality.  It is logical that this platform was used for a normal start, where the main audience of the site ‚Äúsits‚Äù. <br><br>  ‚ÄúInject‚Äù the news about the new project, it was decided with the help of a reputable moderator avtovetki.  Otherwise, everything written could be perceived as an advertisement, which would have a negative effect on the site‚Äôs image and idea.  As a result, over 8 hours, the project was visited by 90 people, the base was replenished with a dozen of topical messages, and the link, apparently, went for a walk into the light - transitions from the ‚Äúbookmarks‚Äù and from ‚ÄúVKontakte‚Äù. <br><br>  The next day, the project was presented on the main site (4K + traffic), on the subdomain of which the ‚ÄúFeedback on the drivers of Belarus‚Äù is placed.  In parallel, a contest was announced for the day and the month, for the prizes of which the real ‚Äúslashing‚Äù began.  At the same time, I sent about five press releases, of which three were immediately published.  By the end of the day, three more sites made repost news. <br><br>  The mention of the very fact of cooperation with the traffic police was already a definite trump card.  As a result, daily traffic amounted to just over 900 people, and the base was replenished with 15 messages.  People came from all of the above sources. <br><br>  The launch day was marked by two other equally important events - shooting a report for the country's most popular state television channel ONT (the agreement with the traffic police played a role) and contact with Yandex, who offered cooperation (press releases played a role). <br><br>  In general, Belarus, <a href="http://drive.s13.ru/">u and well</a> ! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/92937/">https://habr.com/ru/post/92937/</a></p>
