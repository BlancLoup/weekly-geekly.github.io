    <h4>  What is it? </h4><br><br>  Several fan theories regarding the Nolan trilogy about Batman.  If you come across such an article for the first time, <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/270748/">here</a> and <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/270240/">here are</a> two previous articles, and <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/270306/">here</a> you can read about why fan theories are interesting.  This time I tried to cover a wider range of theories, regardless of personal preferences.  Let me know if you do not like this approach. <br><br><h4>  Are we only talking about movies? </h4><br><br>  The DC Universe is a fairly spacious place, and the story of Batman has been dragging on for over 70 years.  To cover such a volume in one article is impossible, not to mention the fact that in the comics themselves there is an unimaginable number of contradictions and restarts.  Because theories will relate exclusively to the three films Nolan.  This does not mean that I will not make references to comics, just theories themselves will be based on films. <br><br><h4>  Spoilers? </h4><br><br>  Films, games, comics about Batman + spoiler from the book Fight Club. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/969/131/9bd/9691319bd126432a9cb436bdd40001cc.jpg"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h3>  Nolan's Universe </h3><br><br>  For a start, a small digression.  As I said before, the DC universe is a fairly heterogeneous place.  Apart from the fact that numerous <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D1%2583%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B2%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_(DC_Comics)">crises have</a> confused the plot lines to impossibility, so also, in 2011 there was a massive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_52">restart</a> , and in June 2016 a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hOFXITBuLMA%3Ffeature%3Doembed">new one</a> is coming.  All this is a bit confusing, but at the same time, it makes it possible to invent alternative stories.  If they somewhere do not fit into the canon - this is just an alternate reality, another world, in which everything is the same except for a few differences.  Speaking of the Nolan trilogy, they use the word <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Nolanverse">Nolanverse</a> .  Some go further and manage to weave into the narrative also the rest of Nolan's films.  I personally did not manage to build / find any interesting theory on this topic, but you can search by yourself.  Before moving on to the most interesting, in fairness, you need to point out a few popular theories that I personally don‚Äôt like. <br><br><h3>  Who is the villain? </h3><br><br>  In principle - a fairly common thing.  Often a hero or a villain is a matter of perception.  Especially if we are talking about the universe of comics.  In the case of the Nolan trilogy, I'm not sure about this interpretation, but theories are quite popular, so they are worth mentioning. <br><br><h4>  Joker - Gotham's Hero </h4><br><br>  <sup><i>‚ÄúTo bring a person to complete insanity, you need only one bad day.</i></sup>  <sup><i>That's how far from the rest of the world I am.</i></sup>  <sup><i>Just one bad day.</i></sup>  <sup><i>I'm right?</i></sup>  <sup><i>I know that yes.</i></sup>  <sup><i>I can tell.</i></sup>  <sup><i>You had a bad day, and everything changed.</i></sup>  <sup><i>Otherwise, why dress up like a Flying Rat? ‚Äù</i></sup> <sup><br></sup>  <sup>Joker.</sup> <br><br>  In the film, we perceive the Joker as a terrorist psychopath who wants to distort all good things, which he will reach and destroy everything else. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/85d/5bf/abd/85d5bfabdf1a489e8a49aebd33eb5c64.jpg"><br><br>  But let's look at his actions and their results. <br><br>  The first bank robbery, as we know, had to be done not at all for the sake of money, but in order to lure Lau and deprive the mafia of all means.  Later, it allows Batman to steal Lau from China and bring him to Gotham.  At the same time, during a robbery, the Joker destroys all his people, but leaves the bank employee alive, putting a fake grenade into his mouth. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e07/9b8/f77/e079b8f770c647ed9bc973a0fde1b8f1.jpg"><br><br>  Also, he convinces the mafia to give him the money and burn it.  In fact, this is, if not forever, then certainly for a long time, but will stop the mafia, which acts through bribery and intimidation. <br><br>  In parallel, the Joker saves the city from corrupt officials. As a result, Gorodon heads the police.  There is a problem with corrupt cops, but later the Joker, with the hands of Dent, solves it. <br><br>  As for his ideas with the ship, this is one of the main points of his plan to save the city.  First of all, he created a mixture of two known dilemmas.  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2594%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BB%25D1%258E%25D1%2587%25D1%2591%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE">Prisoner</a> and <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8">trolley</a> .  But, Joker adds a point that takes the problem to the extreme, he promises to blow up both ships in case of inaction. <br><br>  It would seem that the original plan of the Joker is terrible.  But we can't know for sure that he was telling the truth about detonators?  What if pressing a button activated a bomb on the same ship?  Or more.  What if nothing would have happened.  For the whole movie, the Joker hardly speaks the truth a couple of times.  He circled around the fingers of the entire mafia (which is not bad), the police of Gotham and the Dark Knight himself.  Moreover, his manipulations and multiple moves always work out perfectly.  He does not just lie skillfully, he does it like a textbook. <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/HE4o2FJvHa4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhLKQ59uDGZjvWtG1hxG0hSXDvhoA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  See how he does it.  He looks pointedly into the upper left corner, in accordance with the populist idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe liar‚Äôs manners.  He seemed to want to be caught. <br><br>  It would seem that he kept his word when he promised to blow up the hospital if the city didn‚Äôt kill Kolmen Reese, who threatened to reveal the secret of Batman‚Äôs personality. Harvey Dent.  He could not find out if Reese was killed.  Those.  in any case he would have blown up the hospital, showing that the terrorists cannot be trusted.  At the same time, he blows up the hospital only when it is completely empty. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/628/946/ba6/628946ba625044bdb0cd2b190a5d4f27.jpg"><br><br>  Also, thanks to the Joker.  The avenger who was molested, mutilating everyone who came to hand, resigned (and, as we know, disappeared for the next 8 years) <br><br>  And finally, the most important thing is his confrontation with Dent.  Here the Joker plan worked wrong.  If we proceed from the fact that the Joker seeks to restore order in Gotham, then perhaps he wanted Dent to die.  After all, it would help push through the act of Dent, to which we will return. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Why would the Joker die?</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  At the hospital, Joker gives Dent a gun and points himself in the forehead.  It is clear that he wants to corrupt Dent, but it is not clear why so to risk.  I really liked this explanation: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d7a/90c/077/d7a90c077e30400aba871a0b2facde20.jpg"><br><br>  Joker holds his finger on the hook, which would not give the gun to shoot. <br><br>  UPD. <br><br>  It looks like it's just a good shot.  See the <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/manucan/" class="user_link">manucan</a> comment <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/271740/">here</a> <br><br></div></div><br><br>  Since everything went the other way around, the Joker at the end, realizing that he was caught, warns Batman about Dente, hoping that he will succeed in what the Joker failed. <br><br>  My opinion is that this theory lacks grace.  For the most part, it is based on the logical error <a href="https%253A%252F%252Fru.wikipedia.org%252Fwiki%252F%2525D0%25259B%2525D0%2525BE%2525D0%2525B3%2525D0%2525B8%2525D1%252587%2525D0%2525B5%2525D1%252581%2525D0%2525BA%2525D0%2525B0%2525D1%25258F_%2525D0%2525BE%2525D1%252588%2525D0%2525B8%2525D0%2525B1%2525D0%2525BA%2525D0%2525B0%2523.C2.AB.D0.9F.D0.BE.D1.81.D0.BB.D0.B5.C2.BB_.D0.BD.D0.B5_.D0.B7.D0.BD.D0.B0.D1.87.D0.B8.D1.82_.C2.AB.D0.B2.D1.81.D0.BB.D0.B5.D0.B4.D1.81.D1.82.D0.B2.D0.B8.D0.B5.C2.BB%26usg%3DAFQjCNGBF-0mAaDxrQBMuIlt6xFLmahA-Q%26sig2%3D2qf9B-q3iOcpTmP-tDuqwA%26bvm%3Dbv.116636494,d.bGQ">"in consequence, therefore due to</a> . <a href="https%253A%252F%252Fru.wikipedia.org%252Fwiki%252F%2525D0%25259B%2525D0%2525BE%2525D0%2525B3%2525D0%2525B8%2525D1%252587%2525D0%2525B5%2525D1%252581%2525D0%2525BA%2525D0%2525B0%2525D1%25258F_%2525D0%2525BE%2525D1%252588%2525D0%2525B8%2525D0%2525B1%2525D0%2525BA%2525D0%2525B0%2523.C2.AB.D0.9F.D0.BE.D1.81.D0.BB.D0.B5.C2.BB_.D0.BD.D0.B5_.D0.B7.D0.BD.D0.B0.D1.87.D0.B8.D1.82_.C2.AB.D0.B2.D1.81.D0.BB.D0.B5.D0.B4.D1.81.D1.82.D0.B2.D0.B8.D0.B5.C2.BB%26usg%3DAFQjCNGBF-0mAaDxrQBMuIlt6xFLmahA-Q%26sig2%3D2qf9B-q3iOcpTmP-tDuqwA%26bvm%3Dbv.116636494,d.bGQ">"</a>  Despite the fact that the city really became calmer after the events of the Dark Knight, but there is no reason to believe that the Joker had such an intention.  Practically in any, even the most terrible events, you can find positive notes.  But this does not mean that the events themselves have acquired a positive connotation.  If the Joker decided to hide his "heroism", then he did it perfectly. <br><br><h4>  Bane believed in Batman </h4><br><br>  This theory, it seems to me, is even weaker than the previous one. <br><br>  Proponents of this theory believe that all of Bane‚Äôs actions are aimed at bringing the Dark Knight back.  Moreover, according to different versions, Talia Al Gul knew / did not know about the plans of her right hand. <br><br>  For a start, Bane gave the city an enemy worse than Batman.  Having enticed the bat, Bane showed him that he was not strong enough for a new time. <br><br>  In the movie Batman: The Beginning, Ra's Al Ghul tells Wayne that his father is to blame for the fact that Wayne is orphaned.  Bruce replies that his father did not know how to fight, to which Ras says that not training, but spirit is important. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bc2/345/376/bc2345376ec94b4e906b8fa1e0d71f6b.jpg"><br><br>  Ra's Al Ghul, among other things, was a mentor to Bane.  And his student largely adopted the views of the teacher.  He knows that the spirit of Batman is broken and comes up with a plan to help him. <br><br>  To do this, he breaks his back and throws him in a hole, showing that only an overcoming pain can survive.  In order to give Wayne the motivation to not give up, Bane begins to smash Gotham. <br><br>  The next stage of the test is the pit, or rather, the ritual of climbing the wall.  At the same time, the insurance on which the ascent rises, is thrown over something outside the well.  It turns out insurer can help, just lifting a person to the top.  The question is why no one escapes from prison in this way. <br><br>  In fact - this is a rather incomprehensible bloop in the film.  There are several unconvincing theories about this, but this one is one of the strangest.  According to her, the prisoners are accomplices of Bane.  Their only task is to do so that Batman could get out of the well on his own.  Thus, the insurer, in fact, delayed the jumping at the last moment.  Therefore, to rise with the rope was simply impossible. <br><br>  As a result, Batman returns to Gotham stronger than ever.  The truth about Dente becomes famous and the city again gets the hero it deserves. <br><br>  The theory, as I said, is rather weak and basically it is built on two statements: <br>  1) Everything Bane did ‚Äî he did to bring the Dark Knight back. <br>  2) He ‚Äúbeat‚Äù with all his strength, because he believes in Batman and could not allow him to remain weak. <br><br>  The only, relatively interesting point in this theory is that Bane practically kills Batman at the end, despite the fact that the latter has already returned to life.  According to this theory, from the very beginning, Bane wanted to become Batman himself.  To do this, he lured out Batman, found out who it was, gave him a good name, and was going to kill and save Gotham under his mask. <br><br>  Unfortunately, even this assumption is rather flimsy.  Indeed, after Bane learned the identity of Batman, he could immediately kill him, put on a mask and save the city. <br><br><h4>  Arkhem Hospital Patient </h4><br><br>  This theory is in the class of the most disliked theories, and in its pure form, I would not insert it into the article at all.  But the more I thought about her, the more details I recalled in her support. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a7d/775/d6c/a7d775d6ce0b4ef4bdcc8bd3ba0f542b.jpg"><br><br>  According to the theory, Bruce Wayne, in whose eyes his parents were killed, went insane and retired to himself.  Since then, he is in Arkham.  Wayne's injury is associated with the inability to save his parents, because in his imagination, he draws himself a hero, able to stop any criminal.  At the same time, he cannot defeat all enemies, otherwise for his fantasy, there will simply be no reason.  His imagination draws enemies more and more dangerous and the battle goes not for Gotham, but for the mind of the hero. <br><br>  At the same time, he complements his fantasy with real people and objects.  All his enemies are doctors and other patients.  Say scarecrow - writes pills, two-faced - this is a guard, who is kind to patients, then cruel.  A female cat is a patient from a neighboring ward who dreams of escaping prison.  Gordon - head of the hospital.  Alfred, in my opinion, the same Alfred.  Many of their dialogues are that Bruce must abandon Batman and become Bruce Wayne.  Alfred's biography, unlike the rest, is known to Bruce since childhood.  Because Alfred presented in the film, most likely, as close as possible to the real. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Batman for batman himself</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Alfred is a former military man and, perhaps, it was from him that Wayne heard the word "Batman."  The fact is that in the US military so called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman_(military)">batmen</a> .  According to <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2594%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%2589%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA">Wikipedia</a> , the functions of batman: <br><br>  1) The transfer of orders officer subordinates as a parade. <br>  2) Cleaning officer uniforms and boots, taking care of officer luggage. <br>  3) Driving an officer's car, including in combat conditions. <br>  4) The duties of the officer bodyguard. <br>  5) Perform other orders of the officer, to save his time. <br>  (!) At the end of the service, the orderly officer could continue to perform his duties with a retired officer as a domestic servant. <br><br></div></div>  . <br><br>  Bruce's first therapist was Henri Dukart (Ra'c Al Ghul), he helped to overcome the blame for the death of his parents and, for a while, Wayne was on the mend.  Then Ra's took decisive steps and tried to make Bruce "destroy" the fictional city of Gotham and return to reality.  This worsened and, despite the help of Dr. Crane (the scarecrow), Bruce closed again, and his alter ego only became stronger. <br><br>  Despite the fact that Bruce was no longer guilty, he was still scared.  He was frightened by the uncertainty of what might be hiding behind Gotham.  He was frightened by the possibility of losing loved ones; he was frightened by people.  At the end of "Batman Beginning," Gordon and Batman communicate on the roof (in fact, at the end of each part, there is a dialogue between Gordon and Batman).  Gordon tells Batman that a new character has appeared in the city and shows a map.  If you look at the questionnaire, you can notice the name: J. Kerr. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7e7/39c/01d/7e739c01da094c70b646245a380b89ef.jpeg"><br><br>  In reality, Gordon tells Bruce about a new therapist, whose name is Joe Kerr. <br><br>  Joker uses a variety of treatment methods to reach Bruce and he almost succeeds.  From this point of view, the scene of interrogation at the police station is seen in a new light.  In fact, this is the therapy that Gordon is watching.  By the end of the film, the Dark Knight is ready to believe people, but here, the new security chief, Harvey Dant, shows his second face.  Suppose one day, Wayne found Dent for a conversation with Gordon.  Gordon was with the children and clearly worried about something.  Bruce, knowing what Dent actually looks like, rushes to help Gordon and accidentally kills Dent. <br><br>  Due to the incident, Joker is dismissed, and Wayne is transferred to a solitary ward, where he has been in the next eight years, losing his human appearance.  Here, only Alfred visits him, who dreams of someday seeing Bruce recover.  The third part is Bruce‚Äôs entire struggle with himself.  Bane is his pain of loss.  Therefore, his name is consonant with the word pain (pain is the main theme of the third part).  The city is trying to seize power while Bruce struggles with pain.  In this way, the scene with the rise does not look silly, because it is only a metaphor.  Bruce is finally ready to meet his pain and come to terms with it.  At this time, he often remembers Ra's, as he was the one who tried to help him out of his imprisonment.  A female cat is a neighbor in the ward, who somehow somehow manages to get into his ward.  Waist is a new therapist. <br><br>  At the end of a bomb blast closes the circle.  He found another way.  Gotham is intact, but he no longer needs the hero.  The world is quiet and peaceful, one that Bruce Wayne needs. <br><br>  The final scene in the cafe is either a happy ending in which Bruce and Selina left and left, or Wayne's new fantasy. <br><br>  There are some more popular theories that I don‚Äôt like, but I think I have spent enough time, you can move on to the most interesting. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Batman vs batman</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  A bit of absurdity before turning to theories.  In 2009, the mayor of Batman, a small town in Turkey, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/harut-sassounian/bizarre-lawsuit-embatmane_b_153175.html">sued</a> Nolan for illegally using their town‚Äôs name in the film. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dae/bf7/eb4/daebf7eb47324de5bb32da2018044bda.jpg"><br><br>  He claimed that the film somehow caused an outbreak of murders and female suicides in the city.  Also, residents of the city had problems with registering their business in Europe.  In particular, a native of the city could not name his restaurant in Germany in honor of his native city. <br><br></div></div><br><br><h3>  Agent Joker </h3><br><br>  Joker is probably my favorite comic villain.  And one of the reasons why I like the Nolan trilogy so much is how well they conveyed the character.  The character first appeared in April 1940 and for the entire time of its existence, its prehistory has not been disclosed.  The fans came up with many different theories about the origin of the Joker, but regarding these films, as for me, the theory that the Joker is the best ... James Bond <br><br>  Well, not Bond himself, of course, Joker, obviously, has no English accent.  But still.  Remember the movie "Die but not today." <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/df7/1da/31e/df71da31e855472d8728999d31467734.jpg"><br><br>  In the prologue, we see Bond being tortured for a year.  When it is finally released - it is in a terrible state.  Now imagine that he was never traded.  Imagine that he was tortured for so long, and with such inhuman methods, that he lost all human appearance.  I can easily imagine how once, the investigator asked him: "Why so serious", - and spent a knife from ear to ear.  And now, let's see why this may be true. <br><br>  1) The joker can use a variety of weapons and vehicles. <br>  2) He can handle explosives. <br>  3) He makes plans so unthinkable that it seems as if there was no plan <br>  4) He is a connoisseur of poisons and prefers silent ways to kill. <br>  5) In the famous scene "this is magic", he kills a person with a pencil.  The use of pencil and other household items as a weapon is a frequent sign of special training in the world of cinema. <br>  5) He uses a variety of gadgets, wears costumes, knows how to disguise. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2a7/80d/55c/2a780d55c6194c37aaa6705cda9c7760.jpg"><br><br>  6) He is not inferior to Batman hand to hand. <br>  7) When Batman beats him at the police station, the Joker calmly endures it, the pain is familiar to him.  Moreover, when Batman hits him for the first time, the Joker says: "Never start with the head, the victim is lost."  It can be assumed that he knows about torture not by hearsay.  There are other hints in this scene. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/X7LsBMA-rKg%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiowfOgpLJQvdCRXOEwQMABo-tbXw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Still not convinced?  Then remember how he tells two versions of the origin of scars.  He does it quite convincingly and each version fits perfectly on his image.  Just as Bond uses different legends in each mission.  It is also strange that neither Alfred nor Gordon could find absolutely no information on the Joker.  At the same time, the Joker somehow managed to assemble a gang, penetrate the highest criminal circles, and buy a lot of weapons.  A person who previously had no problems with the law could hardly know how to turn it all up. <br><br>  The theory that the Joker is a former special agent explains all his skills very well, and it also explains why there is no information about him.  If he was left to die, the government most likely denied his existence.  Interestingly, although the word joker is usually perceived as a prankster, it is also the strongest card in the deck that can adopt the characteristics of any other card in many games.  Great codename for cool agent, as for me. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Do you know Tyler Durden</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  But this theory is simply amazing.  In the movie "Fight Club", at the end, we see the narrator shooting his cheek.  But in the book, shortly before this, there is another scene.  The narrator comes to the fight club and calls on all the participants.  In the end, during the battle, he punch his cheek. <br><br>  <i>The bullet from Tyler's pistol tore my second cheek apart, so that I had a grin from ear to ear.</i>  <i>Like an evil halloween pumpkin.</i>  <i>Like a Japanese demon.</i>  <i>Like a Miser Dragon.</i> <br><br>  The character of the Joker, especially from the movie, is so much like Tyler that you start thinking that this is no fiction. <br><br>  <i>I wanted to burn the Louvre.</i>  <i>Crumble with a hammer into small pieces the Greek collection in the British Museum and wipe Mona Lisa.</i>  <i>From now on this world belongs to me!</i> <br><br>  He does not need extra motivation to do what he does.  Alfred, at some point, tells Wayne: "he just wants to see the world on fire." <br><br>  <i>One has only to imagine that we can burn like tobacco in this flying cigar case, as my insomnia passes, and I begin to nod happily.</i> <br><br>  Tyler also understands explosives and weapons, makes large-scale plans, wears flashy clothes and easily endures torture. <br><br>  You can even notice the similarities in how they react to beatings.  They pretend to laugh. <br><br><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/76222473&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhnPTqbZPeYT965-XMeH2i3F-y8_w" width="560" height="234" frameborder="0" title="Fight Club Lou VS Tyler Durden" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Finally, the Joker has a whole army of subordinates who will fulfill any of his orders and never surrender them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/48c/7d5/3a5/48c7d53a5a4b4cceb67115d8e4705e99.jpg"><br><br>  Thus, "Fight Club" is a prehistory to the Dark Knight in the world, where Tyler finally took over <br><br></div></div><br><br><h3>  Political Allusions </h3><br><br>  Attention!  I just point to certain references in the film, and do not express any opinion.  I beg you, refrain from political discussions in the comments, we are talking about the movie. <br><br>  The very image of Batman is similar to the political image of the United States: rich, technologically advanced, cruel (although not recognizing this) and self-righteous.  Accordingly, his enemies are historical enemies of the United States. <br><br><h4>  1. Batman: the beginning.  Fascism </h4><br><br>  The League of Shadows in this film is shown as a brutal military group, unquestioningly executing any, even the most terrible orders.  Naturally, they believe that they act with the best of intentions and, in the end, will be able to rid the world of dirt.  At first, Bruce listens to them, being deceived by Ra's, he learns from him, but having recognized what the League of Shadows is going to undertake, he turns against them.  Also, as the USA, albeit with a delay, turned against fascist Germany. <br><br>  In fact, Bruce Wayne, in this case, personifies Franklin Roosevelt, and Batman is a new course designed to save the country / city, despite the fact that many of his actions are undemocratic. <br><br>  When Bruce asks Ra's attackers of Gotham before, he replies that their weapons improved over time and in Gotham they experienced a new one: the economy.  We know that the difficult economic condition of the city is the cause of almost all the ills of the city.  Similarly, the Second World War was preceded by the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2592%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">Great Depression.</a> <br><br>  In the end, Bruce destroys the train, which was shown to us as a symbol of the economic transformations of his parents.  He had to cancel some accomplishments in order to save Gotham from a new, terrible external threat.  Just as Roosevelt had to tighten the screws to save the country from the effects of the Depression. <br><br><h4>  2. The Dark Knight: Terrorism </h4><br><br>  In the second part, we are shown the US opposition to terrorism.  The fact that the Joker is terrorism is a rather obvious idea, but what‚Äôs funny is that in Bruce Wayne you can see references to George Bush (they wrote a lot about this in due time) <br>  1. He announces the fight with the Joker above all.  (One of Bush‚Äôs achievements is his anti-terrorism policy) <br>  2. In order to calculate the Joker, Batman began to listen to every mobile phone in the city, which could be a reference to the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582">Patriotic Act</a> .  In both cases, the issue of ethics is raised. <br>  3. In real life, Bruce Wayne is a reveler and drinker.  This may be a reference to recognizing Bush about his problems with alcoholism. <br>  4. The sign of Batman in the film resembles the letter W, which is Bush's nickname. <br><br><h4>  3. Revival of the legend: Communism </h4><br><br>  When I first watched this movie, I laughed for a few minutes over this frame.  I don‚Äôt know if this is intentional reference, but it‚Äôs very similar. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c84/20a/34b/c8420a34b96749a8a87fcae0c240b974.png"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you do not remember, in this frame, Bane, standing on an armored vehicle, tells us that the city should belong to the citizens, not the rich and politicians. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After that, pogroms and trials of aristocracy begin throughout Gotham. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For this theory, says that the heroes are fighting for the possession of nuclear weapons. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Also, it's funny that one of the movie trailers was released on May 1st. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Each of these theories, by itself, looks weak, but all together are pretty convincing.</font></font><br><br><h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Whom does Batman protect? </font></font></h3><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I did not know this when I watched the movie for the first time, but when I found out, this fact struck me. The revival of the legend, inspired by the </font></font><a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%258C_%25D0%25BE_%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B2%25D1%2583%25D1%2585_%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B0%25D1%2585"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"Tale of two cities" by</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Dickens. The events of the film refer to the </font></font><a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25AD%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D1%2585%25D0%25B0_%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0_(%25D0%25A4%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D1%2586%25D1%2583%25D0%25B7%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D1%258E%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F)"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">era of terror</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , and Batman is Sydney Carton, the main character of the book. In both cases, at the beginning we see the main character - descended and living aimlessly his days. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">... what could be more sad than a person with rich talents and noble feelings, who could not find a real use for them, could not help himself, take care of his happiness.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At the end of the book, Sydney Carton sacrifices himself for another man, an aristocrat who should have been unjustly executed. Before ascending the guillotine, he says: ‚ÄúWhat I do today is immeasurably the best I have ever done; I am happy to find peace that I did not know in life. ‚Äù The same text, word for word, repeats Gordon at Wayne's funeral.</font></font><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/aQo0xqhVXb8%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiVaaN8AIprlaJnclF1nrY_c9y27g" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">All this led me to certain reflections. What is so good does Batman and whom he actually protects. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Let's take a look at Gotham, torn apart by various problems based on corruption and poverty. We know that Wayne's parents tried to help. Ra's al Ghul says plainly that they prevented him. As a symbol of their achievement, we are shown a monorail across the entire city. The monorail that Batman destroys during a fight with Ra's.</font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fa7/794/59e/fa779459ee34497eb8fd70a027473508.jpg"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Remember, the Dent Act, which I mentioned earlier. Its essence is casually explained in the film. Members of organized crime are denied bail and the penalties for them are more brutal. Leaving aside the fact that this is unconstitutional. In one of the dialogues, Gordon tells Dent that the rich top of the mafia can easily get away from it, to which Dent replies that their poor minions cannot. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It turns out, the act is directed against poor people, the very bottom of the mafia. People, most of whom became criminals just because of the disastrous economic condition of Gotham.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Now back to the beginning. Bruce Wayne, a multi-billionaire who owns the largest company, returns to the city. He is obsessed with understanding and destroying crime. But what is he doing for this? Sews a suit and worn around the city brutally beating criminals. At the same time, he spends a lot of money on the purchase of hotels and cars, delves into the department of applied developments of his company and rivet his cool gadgets. At the same time, in fact, he uses the speed of his company to finance his hobby, which is already criminal.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In fact, philanthropist Bruce Wayne could do much more for the city than Batman. At the very least, he could follow the path of his parents, who were fighting poverty in the city and curing a disease, not a symptom. But he did not even try to keep track of the affairs of his company, which was originally built to help people. As a result, he lost all the money and the company (let us leave aside how improbable this was done, in the end this is a parallel reality, maybe the exchange works differently here) His support for Dent and his act also says that Batman clearly preferred protect rich friends, not the population of Gotham.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Wayne's only actions that speak well of him are to help an orphanage and an attempt to create a compact thermonuclear reactor, which, as a result, he did not dare to use. The first is a consequence of the fact that Wayne himself is an orphan, the second is a clear sign that Wayne prefers to set himself ‚Äútough‚Äù tasks rather than solve problems consistently. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And, although he stopped the destruction of the city several times, it is obvious that he himself was partly to blame for the troubles. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">1) To Batman: The Beginning, the League of Shadows uses a microwave installation to deliver gas (again, let's leave aside its unrealism). The weapons that were developed by Wayne, just because Bruce himself decided to go in search of adventure</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">2) In The Dark Knight, it is obvious that the Joker is obsessed with Batman. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Gordon even warns Batman about this at the end of the first movie, saying that a special hero will attract special criminals. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">3) The bomb was created by Wayne himself, not to mention the fact that all events were revenge for the killing of Ra's. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">4) "Killing" Batman, Bruce Wayne did not stay to help rebuild the city, and went to Europe to sip cocktails with Catwoman.</font></font><br><br><div class="spoiler"> <b class="spoiler_title"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And about the ending of the third part</font></font></b> <div class="spoiler_text">      ,         . ,    4     ,      . -      ,        .     . <br><br>     ,     . <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/ohQY7kpOc50%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjk77gjWlV0rpVMc--Uy6L0Hmnvkw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>      ,       (1:33).  ,  ,      ,    . ,      ,     ‚Äî ? <br><br>  ,    ,  .    ,        ,  ,        . <br><br>  ,       ,     .      ,          (2:00).        ,     (2:11).      ,  ,      . <br><br>  ,       ,    . <br><br></div></div><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">On this, perhaps, everything. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I apologize for the article being so late. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Because of the heavy workload, I barely had time to pay the article a couple of hours a week, because of this, the integrity was lost and the text, as for me, turned out to be more boring. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It was no longer possible to pull further, so I decided to set it as it was. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I hope more of this will not happen. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In any case, do not be shy in criticism and thank you for reading to the end.</font></font></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/391117/">https://habr.com/ru/post/391117/</a></p>
