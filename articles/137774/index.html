  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How OnLaym got me on digital tv</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Four years ago, I did not think that I would switch from the local Chertanovsky Kaban-Net to some other provider.  I bought myself a huge pile of cheap traffic and spent at top speed.  In 2008, the NCC in Moscow just appeared Onlime - if anyone remembers, it all started with a funny virus on telecomfort.ru.  I liked their approach, I liked the green color:) ... the only thing that didn‚Äôt please At those times at that time was speed.  So I stayed ‚Äúby inertia‚Äù at the local provider for another three years, saying to myself: ‚ÄúSo what if there are breaks for a day, but when it works, everything flies!‚Äù However, even such a sloth as I finally decided that Enough to wear things to the nearby entrance of the guys who do not develop the network.  I wanted, you know, stability!  No sooner said than done.  I called "green", the next day the uncle comes, cheerfully cutting the cable that leads to my apartment somewhere under the roof, and shoots into Onlayma equipment.  Ta-dam!  Inet works, happiness, dedicated ip and other joys. <br><br>  But it was just a long backstory!  The essence of the post is not at all in accessing the web.  After all, I had been thinking in the same way for a long time that I would not connect to any particular TV package.  And not here it was!  Six months ago, the bell rings, I pick up the phone, and "at the end of the wire" - a pleasant girlish voice <a name="habracut"></a>  , with whom we have a dialogue: <br><br>  - Ivan, would you like to test Onlayme digital television for two months? <br>  - Yes, I somehow TV and do not watch almost.  Discovery except that.  I am probably not your target audience ... <br>  - Well, we have a bunch of popular science channels in the package, so I advise you to try.  You'll like it! <br>  - Well, ooook, let's, especially since I have already connected your Internet ...

      Then everything happens as fast as in the case of Internet connection.  The courier arrives, gives out a small box, and all the work on the ‚Äúinstallation‚Äù is laid on the client himself.  They are reduced to the fact that you need to get out of the box CAM-module <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/12e/3e2/a92/12e3e2a924fbb7815a57c38be3fb5ed4.jpg"><br><br>  plug in a smart card module <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/877/478/7a4/8774787a4c394196b39e1f9f6cfd89f0.jpg"><br><br>  insert it into the slot (Cl, Cl + (the latter in the future will be able to provide more buns to the user) on the back of the TV set that supports the digital cable broadcasting standard - DVB-C <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7b0/d22/bce/7b0d22bced7d8f7c6cbbf85194bd9354.jpg"><br><br>  and connect the antenna cable, which Onlayma engineers have already carefully attached to the media converter.  The latter divides the signal from the provider into two parts: one goes over the aforementioned coaxial cable to the TV set, the other - in the form of IP packets over a twisted pair - to the home router or directly to the network computer. <br><br>  If you just want to watch the channels and, maybe, switch the language from time to time, you can limit yourself to a minimum package with 95 channels for two and a half hundred rubles a month.  If you want to feel yourself in the 21st century and watch TV in HD quality, if you please pay the same amount for unlocking 13 channels in high resolution. <br><br>  At this point, you could finish the story, save the dock on a Google server and not show the respected habrovans in view of dubious interestingness.  But just before the New Year, the baggage of impressions from the Onlaym services was replenished with new details, so I am telling you further! <br><br>  The guys from Onlaym suggested that users try to feel like law-abiding citizens and refuse to download torrents.  To do this, instead of the CAM module, use an external HD receiver to which the twisted pair with the Internet is connected (naturally, from the same provider :).  Thus, the user also has a data channel through which you can order video for yourself.  Video on Demand (or, in the terminology of Onliam, ‚ÄúVideo Rental‚Äù) offers about ‚Äúthree thousand hours of movies, TV shows, cartoons and TV programs‚Äù.  So it is written on their website, although I, of course, did not consider it myself. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/67b/c79/e35/67bc79e355011ff5b50f2cc38508ba2d.jpg"><br><br>  This service is based on the OnLime.net portal using Over the Top technology and for six months (that is, until May 2012) it will work in test mode.  The subscription fee for it all this time will not be removed.  As for filling with content, then, of course, this is not a fountain ... The most recent films are dated 2010, and for the time being, the majority of films are Soviet classic known to everyone.  In terms of television programs - better: if someone likes all kinds of talk shows, then they are there with a shaft wali.  However, there are also quite a few interesting educational programs from channels like My Planet. <br><br>  In addition, representatives of the company say that the plans for the development of "Video Rental" is the possibility of using the received content on multiple devices.  More specific data about this could not be found, but I personally doubt that I mean the ability to download video from the set top box to, for example, a mobile phone.  But there is accurate information that within this service weather widgets, traffic monitoring, the possibility of paying bills, etc. will also be implemented.  etc.  In short, Onlaym, before it is too late, wants to gain a foothold in the market of intelligent TV, which is gradually emerging.  Google TV, the upcoming Apple iTV (or what will they call them?) Is, of course, good, but in Russia and even in Moscow smart TVs are unlikely to become commonplace soon.  I think many will prefer not to spend money on new hardware, but to pump out old TV with the help of such services. <br><br>  Meanwhile, the two-month testing of TV from Onlaym ended a long time ago, and I decided to fork out an additional 250 rubles a month: let me watch only a couple of programs in the evening / at night, but the household is happy with the abundance of channels.  I won‚Äôt be ready to buy a Full-HD telly, but when I mature, I think that I‚Äôll be spreading another 250 rubles per month.  for the HD-picture, although the general 500 rubles per month for TV in my understanding is a bit too much.  It is hoped that the services will continue to develop, and the subscriber will decrease slightly by increasing the number of users. <br><br>  Well, the global conclusion from all this sheet is this: it's easy to get used to the good and it's hard to refuse it later :) <br><br>  Have you had this? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/137774/">https://habr.com/ru/post/137774/</a></p>
