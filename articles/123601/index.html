      Let's see how it was. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><h4>  Platform 2000 </h4><br>  The history of the well-known in Russia and abroad conference “Platform.  Defining the Future ”began in 1999.  Then the conference had a short name and was held under the name “Platform 2000”.  The main audience of the first “Platform” became the directors of informatization (a term of that time) and IT managers. <br><br><img title="image" alt="image" src="http://vyunev.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/image16.png?w=549&amp;amp;h=173" width="549" height="173"><br>  <em><sup><em>Photos from the</em> <a href="http://www.osp.ru/cw/1999/46/38830/"><em>site osp.ru</em></a></sup></em> <br><br>  The themes of the first “Platform” are interesting, in 1999 Microsoft told about: <ul><li>  corporate implementation of Office 2000; </li><li>  Features and methodology for implementing Windows 2000; </li><li>  strategic issues of enterprise information management and the reduction of TCO; </li><li>  Preparation of computer software organizations to the format of the dates of the 21st century, that is, the solution to the “2000 problem” </li></ul>  As you can see, the first “Platform” raised the pressing problems of IT departments and could not boast of a large scale.  But that was only the beginning. <br><br><h4>  Platform 2001 </h4><br><img title="image" alt="image" src="http://vyunev.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/image17.png?w=189&amp;amp;h=59" width="189" height="59"><br><br>  In November 2000, the “Platform” was repeated, and this time the main theme was a completely new at that time Microsoft .NET application development platform.  The conference has grown considerably; it has already been held for three days from November 22 to November 24 at the Radisson-Slavyanskaya Hotel.  More than 750 people took part in the second “Platform”. <br><br><img title="image" alt="image" src="http://vyunev.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/image18.png?w=438&amp;amp;h=201" width="438" height="201"><br>  <em><sup><em>photo from</em> <a href="http://www.pcweek.ru/themes/detail.php%3FID%3D56234"><em>pcweek.ru</em></a></sup></em> <br><br>  Five parallel tracks of reports were presented on “Platform 2001” in each of the three days.  In total, more than 70 reports, 4 round tables, 14 laboratory works (for 300 participants) were held at the conference. <br><br>  In addition to .NET technology, the conference discussed the topics of upgrading enterprise information systems and increasing efficiency, Exchange 2000 and SQL Server 2000 server technologies, and Windows 2000 operating system. <br><br>  And now a little excursion into the history and web 1.0.  The Platform 2001 website has been preserved to this day.  You can find it at <a title="http://platforma2k.ru/" href="http://platforma2k.ru/">http://platforma2k.ru/</a> .  I think many people with nostalgia remember the words “To view this site, you must install Internet Explorer 4.0 or higher.”  True, according to eyewitnesses, this site is not entirely official, but is a copy of the disc published by one of the conference participants.  However, this resource does not diminish its rarity. <br><br><h4>  Platform 2002 </h4><br><img title="image" alt="image" src="http://vyunev.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/image19.png?w=131&amp;amp;h=72" width="131" height="72"><br><br>  The third “Platform” was held in November 2001.  This time the target audience of the conference was leading experts and heads of IT departments of various enterprises in Russia and the CIS. <br><br>  The themes of the conference “Platform 2002” were new fundamental technologies: Windows XP, 64-bit Windows architecture, server solutions of the company.  And although the volume of reports was somewhat reduced (the conference lasted two days), more than 850 people took part in the conference. <br><br>  The conference continued the discussion of the .NET platform and the new Visual Studio .NET application development environment.  In addition, the key topics of the conference were the recently released Office XP, BizTalk Server, Exchange Server, SharePoint Portal Server, Microsoft AppCenter, Content Management Server, and preliminary versions of Windows .NET Server and SQL Server “Liberty”. <br><br>  A big step forward was the reports from representatives of the company from the headquarters in Redmond and the European office. <br><br><h4>  Platform 2003 </h4><br>  The next, fourth, conference “Platform 2003” was held in November 2002.  This time more than 1000 people took part in the conference.  The number of streams of technical reports was again increased to five: <ul><li>  Information Infrastructure: Windows 2000 Server, Windows .Net Server, Systems Management Server, Operations Manager, Application Center, Internet Security and Acceleration Server, Exchange Server and Mobile Information Server; </li><li>  Business application building platform: BizTalk Server, SQL Server, .Net Framework, Commerce Server, Content Management Server; </li><li>  Business Productivity Systems: Office, SQL Server, Project Server, Sharepoint Portal Server, Content Management Server; </li><li>  Information security technologies: security, public key infrastructure, building a VPN; </li><li>  Development of applications in the .Net architecture: Visual Studio .NET, ASP.NET, Visual Basic .NET, C #. </li></ul>  As you can see, the number of reviewed technologies has increased and the conference has become much more saturated.  And a very important step in the development of the conference was that participation in it was paid.  It was the first “Platform” for the money.  And in spite of this, the number of participants not only did not decrease, but also increased, which demonstrated the great value of the “Platform” as an IT event. <br><br><h4>  Platform 2004. Defining the Future </h4><br>  In 2003, another fifth platform took place, which this time acquired an additional slogan “Defining the Future”.  This is indeed a landmark slogan, since the name of the conference always featured the next year, which indicated that the technologies presented at the conference are technologies of the future, nearest or slightly distant.  The conference for hundreds of participants opened a laser show. <br><br><img title="image" alt="image" src="http://vyunev.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/image20.png?w=336&amp;amp;h=250" width="336" height="250"><br>  <em><sup><em>Photo from</em> <a href="http://www.sql.ru/articles/mssql/Conferenc/patform2004/index.shtml"><em>sql.ru</em></a></sup></em> <br><br>  By tradition, “Platform 2004” was held in November.  The conference was opened by Kirill Tatarinov, vice president of Microsoft Corporation, who had come specially to the event in Moscow.  Other guests at the conference were: David LeBlank - security architect, one of the main ideologists of the Trustworthy Computing secure information systems initiative, and Eric Van Bever - chief application architect at Microsoft's European headquarters. <br><br>  The themes of the conference this time were new products and initiatives: Exchange 2003, Office 2003, Dynamic Systems Initiative, Windows Server 2003, Longhorn, Microsoft Operations Manager, SQL Server Yukon, the next version of Visual Studio “Whidbey”, BizTalk Server 2004 and others. <br><br>  The conference took a step further and in 2003 it was already visited by about 1,500 people. <br><br><h4>  Platform 2005. Defining the Future </h4><br><img title="image" alt="image" src="http://vyunev.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/image21.png?w=373&amp;amp;h=139" width="373" height="139"><br><br>  The sixth “Platform 2005” was held from November 30 to December 1.  This “Platform” is particularly notable for the fact that for the first time the conference was opened by a new director of the Microsoft office in Russia - Birger Sten. <br><br><img title="image" alt="image" src="http://vyunev.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/image22.png?w=335&amp;amp;h=250" width="335" height="250"><br>  <em><sup><em>photo from</em> <a href="http://www.thg.ru/business/20041130/microsoft_platform-01.html"><em>thg.ru</em></a></sup></em> <br><br>  The conference presented the traditional five streams of technical reports: <ul><li>  Technologies for creating managed information systems; </li><li>  Technologies for building secure information systems; </li><li>  Modern enterprise business platform: Microsoft ERP and Microsoft CRM; </li><li>  Solutions to improve business efficiency; </li><li>  Creation and integration of applications for a modern enterprise. </li></ul>  Microsoft shared information about new products released in 2005: .Net Framework 2.0, Windows Server 2003 64-bit, Windows Server 2003 R2, Windows Server 2003 HPC, SQL Server 2005, System Center 2005, Visual Studio 2005, and others. <br><br>  One of the announcements of “Platform 2005” was the announcement of the official Russification of the new at that time Office OneNote product. <br><br>  In total, the conference in 2004 was attended by over 1,200 people. <br><br><h4>  Platform 2006. Defining the Future </h4><br><img title="image" alt="image" src="http://vyunev.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/image23.png?w=302&amp;amp;h=126" width="302" height="126"><br><br>  The seventh conference “Platform 2006. Defining the Future” was held from December 7 to December 8 in Moscow in the building of the Presidium of the Russian Academy of Sciences.  The central theme of the conference was the close integration of the company's latest products: SQL Server 2005, Visual Studio 2005 and BizTalk Server 2006. <br><br><img title="image" alt="image" src="http://vyunev.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/image24.png?w=314&amp;amp;h=250" width="314" height="250"><br>  <em><sup><em>photo from</em> <a href="http://www.thg.ru/business/20051209/index.html"><em>thg.ru</em></a></sup></em> <br><br>  In 2005, 1,900 specialists came to the Platform.  There were so many visitors that the plenary report in the hall did not have enough seats and some participants had to listen to the report standing.  During the plenary report, Birgen Sten recalled that in 2005, the 15th anniversary of the first Microsoft product in Russian - MSD DOS 4.1. <br><br>  By tradition, several tracks were presented at the conference: <ul><li>  Creating applications for a modern enterprise </li><li>  Building managed information systems </li><li>  Corporate databases </li><li>  Modern systems of collective work </li><li>  Enterprise Application Integration </li></ul>  In addition, for the first time for the Russian community, the capabilities of the next generation Office “12” were demonstrated on this platform. <br><br><h4>  Platform 2007. Defining the Future </h4><br><img title="image" alt="image" src="http://vyunev.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/image25.png?w=320&amp;amp;h=143" width="320" height="143"><br><br>  In December 2006, the eighth “Platform” conference was held in Moscow at the Olimpiysky Sports Complex.  At this time, Microsoft has focused on the conference on its new products: Windows Vista, Office 2007, Exchange Server 2007 and Microsoft Dynamics AX 4.0. <br><br>  The conference has grown significantly in volume, in 2006 it already contained 8 technical tracks, on which about 50 reports were read.

Defining the future </h4><br><img title="image" alt="image" src="http://vyunev.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/image26.png?w=403&amp;amp;h=141" width="403" height="141"><br><br>  The ninth conference “Platform 2008.

As a special guest at the conference, Eric Radder, Vice President for Technical Strategy at Microsoft, spoke. <br><br><img title="image" alt="image" src="http://vyunev.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/image27.png?w=400&amp;amp;h=250" width="400" height="250"><br>  <em><sup><em>photo from</em> <a href="http://www.pcweek.ru/idea/picture/detail.php%3FID%3D104610%26amp%3BPICTURE_ID%3D104609"><em>pcweek.ru</em></a></sup></em> <br><br>  At the conference in 2007, more than 1,500 experts gathered to listen to more than 50 reports.
