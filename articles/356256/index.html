      As can be seen from the above text, clause 41 of the Decree of the Government of the Russian Federation of March 28, 2005 No. 161 ‚ÄúOn Approving the Rules for Interconnecting Telecommunication Networks and Their Interaction‚Äù and the requirements for the Agreement on interconnection and interaction of telecommunication networks, including, transmission of information about subscribers, however, the contract requirement does not contain the obligation of operators to transfer the specified information between interconnected communication networks and does not oblige the communication operator to provide information on callers  Hm account in detail. <br><br>  <b>2.</b> On the issue of account details, we report the following.  The legislation in the field of communication does not oblige telecom operators to provide subscribers with detailed incoming calls. <br><br>  In the Resolution of the Government of the Russian Federation of December 9, 2014 No. 1342 ‚ÄúOn the Procedure for Providing Telephone Communication Services‚Äù, paragraph 26, the Subscriber is entitled to: receive additional information about the telephone services provided (account details), including indicating the date and time of connection establishment, their duration and subscriber numbers. <br><br>  The telecom operator bills (account details) for outgoing connections, as incoming connections are free, but Rostelecom PJSC provides the ability to view the details of incoming calls in subscribers' personal accounts. <br><br>  After analyzing the listing of incoming calls, and receiving information from Rostelecom PJSC, we give explanations about the ‚Äú8663 POST‚Äù symbol in your printout: the number of lines corresponding to each incoming call depends on the number of telephone communication nodes participating in this connection and can be from one to four.  The detail of each incoming call in one or more lines of the printout contains information that allows you to uniquely set the number of each caller. <br></div></div><br>  Information from the answers of Rostelecom of one of the regions, the letters are signed by electronic signature. <br><br>  IMHO one of the options: <br><br><ul><li>  There is a gap in legislation </li><li>  Rostelecom does not fulfill the norms of the current legislation and the Roskomnazor closes its eyes to this. </li></ul><br>  The answer was received prior to the entry into force of the Federal Law of December 5, 2017 No. 386-FZ, but even after the entry into force, the subscriber has no reason to receive the detail of incoming connections. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/356256/">https://habr.com/ru/post/356256/</a></p>
