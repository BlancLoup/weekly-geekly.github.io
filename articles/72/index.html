I don‚Äôt know the exact author, but she matured in the depths <a href="http://www.triz-ri.ru/trizchance/">of the TRIZ-Chance System</a> , and I heard it from the mouth of <a href="http://www.triz-ri.ru/authors/sychev_bio.asp">Sergei Valerievich Sychev</a> . <br><br>  Since several years have passed since then, I could be mistaken in details, but it was approximately like this: at one of the seminars, as an example of the principle ‚Äúthe system is perfect when the tool is missing and its function is performed‚Äù, the problem of payment systems via the Internet .

      The disadvantages of existing payment systems are well known - low prevalence, relative difficulty of use for an ordinary user, as well as problems with depositing and withdrawing funds into the payment system. <br><br>  On the other hand, there is a ‚Äúside effect‚Äù of work on the Internet - the traffic generated by this.  So why not use it as a universal payment instrument? <br><br>  If we consider an ideal system in which all Internet users are connected to it according to the payment scheme for megabytes of downloaded information, it is very easy to imagine payment schemes for any content on the principle ‚Äúdownload this 3 megabyte file - this will be your payment for its content ".  And if the file itself is incommensurably small compared to the price that the author wants to get for it, then it is artificially ‚Äúweighted down‚Äù, or there is a special ‚Äú3 megabyte money‚Äù next to it, which must be downloaded to access the file. <br><br>  The introduction of such a system would immediately solve many questions: <br>  - in use the system is easy to pain, because  in order to use it, you only need to pay the provider‚Äôs bills on time; <br>  - it would be easy to resolve the issue of selling a variety of digital content - not only audio and video files, but also just pictures and texts that are freely available; <br>  - for popular authors of digital content, there would be a hunt among providers - after all, providers themselves according to the plan also make payments for mutually consumed megabytes according to the test principle - i.e.  paying dry balance.  accordingly, it is beneficial to keep projects that are not overgrown with a folk trail.  Bloggers, columnists and online journalists would flourish. <br><br>  Of course, the system has a limited scope of application - these are, first of all, mini- and micro-payments on the Internet.  But in this area she would have made a revolution. <br><br>  Why did I post this concept here? <br>  Yes, I am aware that it is utopian and unrealizable in real conditions.  But there is in her some inner beauty, which I appreciate in ideas.  This is like a beautiful program code that no one but its author sees and cannot appreciate, but this makes its beauty less significant. <br><br>  And those who do not see this beauty - please consider it just another strange thing that you met today. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/72/">https://habr.com/ru/post/72/</a></p>
