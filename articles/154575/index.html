There are quite a few ‚Äúvirtual tours‚Äù around the offices of well-known IT companies on the site.  So I decided to invite you to the office OZON.ru, where I work myself. <br><br>  I think most of the inhabitants of Runet are aware of what kind of company it is, but I will explain just in case.  OZON.ru is a huge online megastore where you can buy almost anything from socks to the fridge, but above all, of course, the most interesting books and great gadgets.  Well, let's not get distracted - rather on the way, walk around the Moscow offices of the company! <br><br>  And - carefully: under the cut traffic. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The first on our way is an office on Chapaevsky Lane, in the Sokol Place business center.  It is located in a small cozy courtyard, away from the hustle and bustle of the city, next to the wonderful park on Novopeschanaya.

    <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2fd/526/bae/2fd526baeb43ef01f3f072078b03767e.jpg"><br><br><br>  Here are three floors of ours.  That is, of course, rented, but we have become attached to them with our soul and heart. <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a9d/c06/2b1/a9dc062b100a36fba90f205bd7efcb3b.jpg"><br><br><br>  At the entrance, all modestly.  No garlands to you, halogen signs and the like.  We somehow do not really like pretentious greetings. <br><br>  But we welcome guests cheerfully and friendly!  Welcome to us! <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5e0/400/ce7/5e0400ce7f10b709c73a94031b7760f0.jpg"><br><br><br>  At the reception, as usual, you will be met by the ‚Äúmost charming and attractive‚Äù girl in the world. <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f7a/255/d7c/f7a255d7c8ac9fea08d762b9b60dc429.jpg"><br><br><br>  And, as it should, next to the girl should be flowers.  In our case, it is a company logo made from dried flowers. <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/130/99b/4ed/13099b4ede2b13a4f2f832ad8487e870.jpg"><br><br><br>  For those interested and those who just love to read, here is a booth with information about the company. <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/797/9d4/902/7979d4902b3a383b91d15a26464717cb.jpg"><br><br><br>  We have open space - it's more convenient for us, and more fun all together.  Only executives are forced to sit in offices, because otherwise they will sit in meeting rooms at regular meetings.  Hard life of a superior, in short. <br><br>  Let's quickly go through the floors and see where and what. <br><br>  Sales department <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2a2/1be/8a2/2a21be8a2bee5c78c1e15d2e6cbf3354.jpg"><br><br><br>  As you can see, continuous creativity and fun. <br><br>  Most of the employees are passionate about their work, they are immersed in it ‚Äúwith their heads‚Äù, they also sink their workplace, photos of friends and, from time to time, glasses of coffee. <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e74/86b/85a/e7486b85ac7ffbf543c8b255b6e40290.jpg"><br><br><br>  Advertising department <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/296/9f7/6e0/2969f76e04b2d00acbaa067a6ce6257d.jpg"><br><br><br>  We can‚Äôt find boring jobs here, but God ordered the advertisers to prove themselves! <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fe2/f96/b13/fe2f96b13b7d18973cb9cbea25c8ce8d.jpg"><br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/01d/285/3f4/01d2853f4ff0d00267f126b61df9874a.jpg"><br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c9a/b87/602/c9ab876025825e41d7529e9a73780b88.jpg"><br><br><br>  Near some jobs you can stand for hours studying them. <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/694/8c1/90a/6948c190af229809f5ae650681a4ede8.jpg"><br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/95e/a8f/fc3/95ea8ffc3ea3a4dfdd04667c5baebc74.jpg"><br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f63/84a/951/f6384a95141ad0a5e2626f8a9f9fa793.jpg"><br><br><br>  Like most friendly families in which love reigns, OZON is constantly growing.  HR managers are responsible for adding them to our family - charming girls who know best of all where to find first-class specialists and how to help them realize themselves in our company later! <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/72e/1df/77d/72e1df77df46ed27c5ade11b143f8d97.jpg"><br><br><br>  And this is the office of our CIO.  As you understand, it will get the necessary technology even from under the ground! <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2ef/a4f/965/2efa4f9655a4027d9c3c1199598c4b15.jpg"><br><br><br>  Our friendly OZON-family. <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/62f/520/054/62f520054d9417defca3922a638ed598.jpg"><br><br><br>  On this journey we will finish the 4th floor and go to the IT department. <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e3b/87b/c5e/e3b87bc5e82cec31e28c989b3487e34b.jpg"><br><br><br>  Scrum is practiced here!  Development teams in the company live according to Scrum - all attributes of this methodology are present, namely: iterations, daily rally, planning and presentation of project releases.  All developers are divided into teams, each team has its own dedicated project, which lasts from several months to a year or more.  The composition of the team is usually: 1-2 web developer, team lead, dedicated database developer, tester, analyst and ‚Äúresponsible for the project‚Äù - usually this is the project manager and project owner in one person. <br><br>  The company is developing on the Microsoft stack. <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ee0/0e2/4d9/ee00e24d9264a261095f754fabf7ab13.jpg"><br><br><br>  Working issues are usually discussed in the meeting rooms so as not to interfere with the rest of the work. <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ceb/f05/5aa/cebf055aafab1ad815794571fd978bae.jpg"><br><br><br>  However, even with such a simple and completely office phenomenon as a meeting room, we approach with humor: <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/01b/8a0/2f5/01b8a02f5866138dc2f5aa887e844a04.jpg"><br><br><br>  This is where the so-called Scrum of Scrum - the meeting of all developers. <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/98b/a68/a60/98ba68a60f844af48698717d4eb9b712.jpg"><br><br><br>  All developers in the company have 2 monitors on the desktop <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c4c/c10/904/c4cc1090434689915a37db689c3cca0a.jpg"><br><br><br>  And, of course, all sorts of figures that make working life brighter and more fun. <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0ba/524/8d7/0ba5248d7e7834a61b5c8828006c13ad.jpg"><br><br><br>  ‚ÄúLife posters‚Äù and passing pennants of labor drummers are popular here. <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2f2/227/09e/2f222709eade5b8c59b5116b420f89ec.jpg"><br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/686/fa7/035/686fa7035d8a4227cadf1d587a431a2f.jpg"><br><br><br>  On the 5th floor, where the developers are sitting, the walls are painted by the marketing department (on one of the drawings you can find the secret formula of the Ozone logo).  In other matters, looking at the walls here and without any secret formulas is interesting! <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d5d/35e/aa6/d5d35eaa69801963b060370ffd9b1961.jpg"><br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9c1/72f/124/9c172f12475b5f1398badb26ff40d5aa.jpg"><br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/292/86c/662/29286c6621908dc7759c4cbc902dabfa.jpg"><br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/63f/32e/58b/63f32e58b1367ea0474a2109489ea2f2.jpg"><br><br><br>  Next to the IT department is the marketing department. <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e5b/6c1/0fc/e5b6c10fc2a293079f6de8068a750e21.jpg"><br><br><br>  This is where all sorts of interesting promotions and specials are born.  offers for our favorite customers! <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0ea/488/6be/0ea4886be3c558a3b98e191e06117028.jpg"><br><br><br>  And this is parking for those who prefer to get to work on their iron horses!  There is also a parking for bicycles, which, by the way, is always in demand! <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/683/a7e/857/683a7e857b1f96337d3915afa4e3f691.jpg"><br><br><br>  And next to the office there are open sports grounds, where you can play basketball at lunchtime in the summer and skate during the winter. <br><br><br>  On the 6th floor, which is also an attic floor, the technical support department, the security department and our cafe are located! <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4de/120/dd5/4de120dd5e636b16acac8e4c46e459d6.jpg"><br><br><br>  And here is the security department.  As you can guess, they can not take pictures <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b1c/ebd/6a4/b1cebd6a4b4b6c892fd6fa12d4118aed.jpg"><br><br><br>  This is a cafe for employees.  Here you can relax and chat with colleagues or arrange a heated argument and find the truth! <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/257/83c/1a4/25783c1a4dfb7adb06441ee2f5859e04.jpg"><br><br><br>  The photo is not visible, but the cafe is located vending machine, recently set. <br><br><br>  Interesting fact: they say that in one day, 120 liters of water, 3 kg of coffee are drunk in the company, 5 kg of sugar are eaten and an incalculable amount of tea bags is brewed. <br><br><br>  Here there is such a sunny mood that even cucumbers grow on the windowsill! <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4cf/4af/7ec/4cf4af7ecc7e670917a310b6e8b009de.jpg"><br><br><br>  Here, in the cafe, celebrate various joyful events: birthdays, delivery of the project, anniversary of work in the company.  On such days, the tables of our cafe just burst with cakes, fruit, ice cream and other goodies.  What is not on the holiday table is alcohol: we are for a healthy lifestyle! <br><br><br>  Let's finally go to the office on the Khodynka field <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b5c/960/61a/b5c96061ac04b7b2351b9d800d5276ee.jpg"><br><br><br>  There is a special route taxi for employees from the ‚ÄúAirport‚Äù metro, which is very convenient to get straight to work! <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2b8/541/ee2/2b8541ee2893ea90ced849e9df43f175.jpg"><br><br><br>  This is how our second office looks like, here too open space <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6bb/1e4/ab2/6bb1e4ab2d72adff4093ed3170ce626b.jpg"><br><br><br>  From the window there is a wonderful view of the Khodynskoye field - by the way, this is where the rehearsals for the Victory Day parade take place. <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0df/2fb/499/0df2fb499351cf0b7c36895362d72998.jpg"><br><br><br>  Here we have mobile application developers. <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/328/307/200/328307200e0bd893ed1eef865516607f.jpg"><br><br><br>  Employees of this office have an amazing opportunity to get out on the balcony and get some fresh air. <br><br>  Naturally, I also used this opportunity! <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/496/b99/44d/496b9944dd7ea2b3cf39a98fd985a7d0.jpg"><br><br><br>  Offices are geographically located close to each other, and along the way from one to another, you can even meet some of Moscow‚Äôs sights.  (For example, the highest residential building in Europe - Triumph Palace) <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f7d/ede/aaf/f7dedeaafc597844601aacb1bb23dc0b.jpg"><br><br><br>  So we came back to the office on Chapayevsky.  In conclusion, I will say: we have no bars, rooms with exercise machines and video games, but there are comfortable workplaces, a productive atmosphere and a real working family - OZON Family! <br><br><br>  Thanks for attention. <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/154575/">https://habr.com/ru/post/154575/</a></p>
