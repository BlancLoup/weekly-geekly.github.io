In that article, I expressed a desire to cross the resulting device with virtual reality glasses.  Oddly enough, everything did not stop at the expression of desire.  I, of course, would prefer to use the Oculus Rift, but this is too big a blow on the budget of the provincial loader, especially a blow that is not supplied to Ukraine.  In addition, knowledgeable people say that in our "metropolis" to look for this wonderful device is useless.  Well, I‚Äôll get out of the box a classic loaf of black bread, a screwdriver and threads, and together we will look at the many photos that we can get from this. <a name="habracut"></a>

    <h4>  Construction times </h4><br>  Before studying the topic, it seemed to me that such a device should have a complex optics that cannot be realized at home, but Google has dispelled these fears.  It turns out in order to spoil your eyesight, just a pair of lenses from a clerical store.  In this implementation, biconvex lenses with an outer diameter of 54mm are used.  The packaging shows an increase of 10x, the price is about $ 1 apiece. <br><br>  I literally stuck the first version about half a year ago.  Just to see if you can see the stereo effect.  This freak looked like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bda/d63/60d/bdad6360da8147eb9e826ef0b9d79a1a.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/228/5e5/2e7/2285e52e74464288948d7d91c9e71a31.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Construction two </h4><br>  The effect manifested itself, but literally in a pair of android demos, the rest did not allow <s>setting up the</s> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpupillary_distance">IPD</a> <s>inter-eye</s> , which is important for a 7 'screen.  In addition, in my case, it is necessary not to launch the applications on the tablet, but to stream the image from the computer that drives the electric fabric.  In these matters, I was not able to make tangible progress, so the high-tech virtual reality glasses were abandoned to gather dust on the cabinet.  But after reading the above materials from Habr, I decided to kick the corpse a little more.  I liked the idea of <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/plazmx/" class="user_link">PlazmX to</a> use in the device a <s>box from tools for an</s> industrial production case.  But I decided that it is simpler and better to use a food container: <br><ul><li>  it should be easier; </li><li>  The range of containers is very extensive, it is easier to find the right size. </li></ul>  I stocked up a suitable container, spending $ 1.5 in blood. <br><br>  After the experience of using the first design, I was firmly convinced that rubbing my face against cardboard brick was not very convenient, so I bought such safety glasses for $ 1 at the hardware store (I don‚Äôt know the second where I took it).  I didn‚Äôt like the green ones less, I vivisected them. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5ca/206/3a0/5ca2063a0ed5412e8eee943ab0713e24.jpg"><br><br>  He drilled a hole in his glasses, container and in general in everything he could reach with a crown drill.  I uncovered a soplemet, not sparing the contents, glued the lenses in place, and glued all the design elements together. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Process photos</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9f4/1bd/a15/9f41bda151cd43a5901ea005d2a13091.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/63d/14b/18e/63d14b18e6c940df88a21bc58a849cb7.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/039/e0b/533/039e0b53353c4420967fef6c78168450.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bdb/fa8/4bf/bdbfa84bf6a341b1857c54d0a489fb8b.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/606/354/23e/60635423e65845ee8c5781b1c7fd59e5.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/120/58f/d77/12058fd779494059b69217f5b8180392.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/25b/1d0/62a/25b1d062af2f4da68280c5188693fbe2.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e9b/8e2/bfa/e9b8e2bfa8a14d02b7c5e3d0dff2cb0e.jpg"><br><br></div></div>  Got the following: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dd5/b5e/068/dd5b5e068c644accbc78e239586c1412.jpg"><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Probably I add too many photos, but once the film is still used, do not disappear as good</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/070/5c4/61a/0705c461af7046558c5c93b802b8dcc9.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e36/c4d/085/e36c4d085cdc4dfc991a90f246675763.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f36/4ad/384/f364ad384a784395a973970cd490d4d5.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/839/0c1/b7f/8390c1b7fc784b11b4ac3ff73c005dc0.jpg"><br></div></div><br>  The most attentive readers probably noticed that the source of the material for the very first design was the box from the screwdriver with which I drilled holes for the lenses.  I believe this is a sign.  It remains to find out what it means. <br><br><h4>  Tracker </h4><br><blockquote>  - Girl, here you are bald, how do you hold a bow on your head? <br>  -How nailed, and keeps </blockquote><br>  <s>Strange, but the</s> accelerometer does not work in the tablet from birth.  Despite the fact that the auto-rotate screen works, some (all?) Applications do not see the accelerometer.  I read somewhere that for an auto-turn, eastern friends sometimes put something like a pendulum.  I do not know the reason or not, do not want to dig.  Because of this, and also because I already dealt with <a href="http://www.free-track.net/english/">FreeTrack</a> , I used it.  Also a nice bonus is that this software is natively supported in my car simulator. <br>  FreeTrack determines the position of the head by three points.  To work, you need a web camera aimed at three contrasting markers: for example, LEDs nailed to the head.  As a more humane option - to the cap.  In the normal (average) position of the head markers should not be on the same vertical plane (in this place in this implementation of points I sfilil).  It is better to use LEDs as markers, but you can also use reflectors with external illumination.  I used infrared LEDs.  To power the LEDs, we had to modify the microUSB-OTG cable.  For this, two additional power wires were additionally removed from the cable, to which three LEDs are connected in series through a current-limiting resistor.  According to the idea, the cable functionality should have been saved. <br>  We also had to modify the camera by removing the IR filter from it.  After that, it is desirable to use a visible spectrum filter on the camera.  In this capacity, the fully illuminated color works remarkably well (I did not get the trick from a black-and-white one) film if someone else remembers how it looks. <br><br>  <s>The next version of the bike is assembled, but the wheels were square.</s>  It turned out not so great as seen from the mountain.  The device is assembled, tested, but it turned out to be rather heavy, too big, it was inconvenient to open and, according to tradition, I did not guess a little with the focal length.  The main reason for these jambs was the poor choice of the container.  My tablet is a little asymmetrical, which made it necessary to take a larger container, and the depth of the container suddenly turned out to be less than necessary, but this issue was partially resolved using an additional insert (a piece of white plastic lining in the design).  In addition, I incorrectly screwed the tracker head, setting all the LEDs on the same vertical plane. <br><br><h4>  Design two.one </h4><br>  Having suffered a couple of days, I decided to change the design and buy another container, with convenient snaps, a little deeper and larger.  I bought it, and then it suddenly dawned on me that it was decently heavier.  Fail.  Another ingeniously squandered $ 2.  Well at least did not have time to peel. <br><br>  You probably thought that since I have already described the production of two and a half points, this is all over, I will calm down, and you will start reading comments ?!  Not so simple. <br><br><h4>  Construction three </h4><br>  In the next fit of design, I decided to repeat the first attempt and build a homemade corrugated cardboard case.  It would be possible to use more technological material, but there was no such handy.  The role of the donor agreed to play this box: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b44/534/ec5/b44534ec56394290aa2ee5ba8690f83d.jpg"><br><br>  I cut, glue: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0e3/a0e/2d2/0e3a0e2d25874ce28af0248ee65b0152.jpg"><br><br>  I fasten the attachments for the gum from a piece of tin that is tucked under my arm: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/71f/27b/3d4/71f27b3d452940768622ff407162e708.jpg"><br><br>  As you know, having one marker, you can paint everything except the marker itself.  And with two markers, you can paint everything.  So, in principle, I had the opportunity to paint everything in two layers, but I limited myself to some surfaces of points. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a6c/45d/800/a6c45d8002ca46739a79f2ec1bb0be0d.jpg"><br><br>  I receive: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/659/184/0b1/6591840b180c4d2b9e0e80615e3153c7.jpg"><br><br>  We replace the mutilated container with a freshly assembled cardboard structure.  We change to the correct location of the LED tracker. <br>  Last option at the moment: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d1d/0e6/bc4/d1d0e6bc468a485b9e4fe2d4c882e948.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/799/57a/ee6/79957aee6fb9492ba83f07644898775d.jpg"><br><br>  About software, I will probably write a separate article.  In principle, everything works, but it is crooked.  I even took a <a href="http://youtu.be/xSQyA9YPnvQ">video</a> , but you need to finish the piece of iron to a sane state. <br><br>  And if someone decides to repeat, I will <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/228501/">quote the</a> warning of <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/meklon/" class="user_link">Meklon</a> : <br><blockquote>  The only thing I want to say to those who will repeat is that homemade products are very different in accuracy from factory production.  The result of inaccuracies will be a severe spasm of accommodation and overwork with prolonged use. </blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/233725/">https://habr.com/ru/post/233725/</a></p>
