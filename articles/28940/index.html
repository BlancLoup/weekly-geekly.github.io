How this can end in practice can be seen in the case of Savva Terentyev and the events in Arkhangelsk. <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúThe General considers it necessary to recognize the Internet as a mass media‚Äú with all the legal consequences.  ‚ÄúThe Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Federal Security Service must be more persistent in working with deputies to legally recognize the Internet as a mass media with all the legal consequences for holders of subversive sites.‚Äù </blockquote><br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  <em>¬ªYou have 1000 friends and you have not registered your LJ?</em>  <em>Then we go to you!"</em>

      In addition, the minister decided to take care of young people: in his opinion, on the path of xenophobia, extremist sentiments, legal nihilism and criminal subculture, it is necessary to put a hard barrier. <br><br>  However, the absence of statutory ‚Äúcensorship‚Äù on the web does not prevent law enforcement agencies from fighting bloggers.  In Syktyvkar, on July 7, a court verdict was issued for commenting on LiveJournal on blogger and musician Savva Terentyev.  The court agreed with the highly controversial allegations of the defense and the "experts."  Terentyev was found guilty of a crime provided for by part 1 of article 282 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation for inciting social discord through the Internet. <br><br>  Surprisingly, hundreds of posts and comments, for example, clearly stimulating racial strife, in blogs of various neo-Nazis avoided a similar fate.  No less surprising is the social group "cops", against which, according to the investigation, Sawa spoke. <br><br>  In fact, it is one of the first convictions that created a precedent for restricting freedom of expression on the Internet.  However, in the case of Savva the point has not yet been reached, the defense will appeal the verdict of the court. <br><br>  An attempt by bloggers to organize a flash mob in Arkhangelsk led to an unexpected reaction.  On July 9, LJ had <a href="http://sholademi.livejournal.com/913653.html">news</a> that bloggers from Arkhangelsk were preparing a flash mob for Putin‚Äôs arrival, during which about 200 people on the Prime Minister‚Äôs route would line up and wave white scarves and bow to a passing cortege in a belt, to the northern office of Regnum Received a call from law enforcement. <br><br><blockquote>  According to <a href="http://www.novayagazeta.ru/news/291314.html">Novaya Gazeta</a> , the young man introduced himself as Sergey Zharikov, an operative for the Economic Crimes Department of the Arkhangelsk Region, and asked about the agency‚Äôs source of information.  The agency‚Äôs employees told him that according to the law ‚ÄúOn Mass Media‚Äù they have the right not to disclose information sources.  To this, the security officer admitted that he did not know the law ‚ÄúOn Mass Media‚Äù. </blockquote><br><br>  When asked by the editorial board, how does the EVEC relate to the issue of organizing a flash mob, Zharikov responded that in connection with Putin‚Äôs visit, he was asked to find out who is organizing this action in order to prevent it.  After refusing to call the source of information, the security officer stopped the conversation. <br><br>  How the next initiative to ‚Äúcontrol‚Äù the global network in Russia will end, we will be able to find out soon.  And well, not from the materials of the next case against bloggers. <br><br>  The original version of here <br><br>  <b>UPD</b> <br>  The Live Journal published a survey on the case of Savva Terentyev.  The defense side of Sawa wants to find out how his case will affect the discussion environment in the Russian blogosphere. <br><br>  The survey consists of 5 questions.  Participate in the survey can be <a href="http://sholademi.livejournal.com/915048.html">here</a> . <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/28940/">https://habr.com/ru/post/28940/</a></p>
