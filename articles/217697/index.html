I'm just a C ++ developer.  Some even say good.  And then a nuisance happened to me - I wrote a program, but I can not talk about it sensibly.  Tell people to want to use it.  No, you do not think, this is not my first program, I have eight years of experience in C ++ behind me, ten years of programming in principle in many languages.  It‚Äôs just now that I wanted to develop not for the sake of development, but in order for people to use my program so that it would be useful to someone other than me.  So that I know that I do this not only for the sake of gaining experience, although this is also very valuable in itself, but also so that someone, maybe in the next house, or at the other end of the planet, clicks on the icon of my program .  I would, from realizing this, be damn nice.  And it does not matter what kind of task this program performs, what matters is that it works.  Works for the benefit of people.  After all, the developers precisely for this purpose are in the world so that their creations benefit other people. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I would like to show you one of those programs that I will distribute for free.  It is called <a href="http://neonmercury.github.io/PJournal">PJournal</a> (Eng. Private Journal - personal diary).  Yes, you were not mistaken, this is a personal diary in which you can keep your records.  Moreover, their character is unimportant, they can be both for everyone and only personal, which can only be seen by you.  For the latter, by the way, the entry in the diary is organized through an account. <br>  Why did I choose a program of this type?  Because I want to keep a diary for a long time, but notebooks didn‚Äôt fit in principle, because they have absolutely no protection against those eyes, and all those programs that I tried to use.  were either too overloaded with functions, or too simple.  I just wanted to keep records without any censorship and corrections, otherwise why is a diary needed, right? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c19/764/621/c197646211011e30f8a834bb41164889.png">

      <em>Yes, bootstrap, but better this way than the vigorous design of a single developer without a designer, isn't it?</em> <br><br><h2>  How is the diary useful for IT'shnik? </h2><br><h4>  1. You can add new ideas to the diary. </h4><br>  How many times have you had a great idea?  And how many of these ideas you remember now?  I am sure that these numbers differ by an order of magnitude.  A diary for this can be used - to write down a beautiful idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa startup, in order to return to it later, to work it out in much more detail.  Then, re-reading this very idea, you will be able to re-enter the state in which you thought up it, to re-experience this increase in strength, to get a surge of inspiration. <br><br>  Having formulated the main goal of your idea, you can not retreat from it, keep it always in front of your eyes.  In the same place, you will be able to note progress towards this idea, what you have achieved.  You will be able to formulate the sub-goals, what exactly you need to achieve.  In any case, you will be able to stick to the intended course. <br><br><h4>  2. The diary helps self-organization </h4><br>  If you decide to take on your discipline, you can train it with the help of a diary.  If you try every morning to paint yourself a plan for the evening, and in the evening to mark those points that are fulfilled, you will notice how you will become a more disciplined person.  And if you also write comments, why this or that problem was not solved today, it will be generally wonderful. <br><br><h4>  3. Introspection </h4><br>  Touching on the topic of discipline and self-improvement, we can mention self-analysis.  A person will unwittingly analyze everything that he writes.  And analyzing the day passed, you can see exactly the mistakes that you made.  And after seeing them, you can try not to commit them again. <br><br><h4>  4. Look at yourself </h4><br>  Is this really what I wrote half a year ago?  Strange what a fool he was.  Often a sober look at yourself from the side allows you to discipline yourself and cope with life's troubles. <br><br><h4>  5. Learn to make decisions </h4><br>  If you recall the student or school days, you can see that any difficult and complex tasks were solved on paper.  It is understandable, it is impossible to keep in my head a huge amount of data needed to solve.  And who told you that life is such a simple thing in which you can achieve success on a whim?  You do not think over the architecture of a large system just in your head (I hope not :))?  Expressing the idea on paper, you can make the most suitable decision for you, because you will not operate with the most recent data, but see the whole picture. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dec/81e/2e9/dec81e2e992074f49e1e5bd6b07bc105.png"><br><br><h2>  What features does PJournal offer? </h2><br>  Today it is possible: <br><br><ul><li>  Write notes in a convenient, I hope, text editor. </li><li>  Use markdown syntax. </li><li>  Export to HTML, preview notes. </li><li>  List of all notes with search (by title, by text, by date). </li><li>  Calendar with time to create notes and time editing them. </li><li>  Web interface. </li></ul><br><br>  Further plans: <br><br><ul><li>  The implementation of the script system (in the comments I would like to know which is better to use: Lua or Python). </li><li>  Online database storage of notes (in our cloud, in your cloud, using Dropbox). </li><li>  Increase the comfort of editing notes. </li><li>  Themes design, including custom. </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/82a/80d/ba2/82a80dba25e28ebb7bf6ac4161fd4432.png"><br><br><h2>  What do I want from you? </h2><br>  If PJournal is useful to you, I will be happy.
