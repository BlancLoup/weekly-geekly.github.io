  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to turn all visitors to your site into buyers?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  How to turn an online store visitor into a buyer?  The question is relevant not only for a small site, but also for a huge portal with a long history.  What makes a visitor to choose and order a product from you?  Website usability, adequate product price, availability of delivery and customer support are the most important factors, but based on statistics, this is by no means all. <br><img src="http://www.payu.ru/sites/russia/files/pictures/eshopping.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Up to 50% of buyers do not complete the purchase process.  What is the reason for this, and how to make the percentage of completed payments equal to 100% - questions that we will try to answer in our publications. <br>  Since an important factor in creating an attractive online store is its design, sellers need to be able to integrate the provided online payment system taking into account the design of the entire store.  Therefore, it is important for sellers to have the opportunity to make changes to the design of the payment page independently and at any time.  For this, the payment system should include the ability to change the color scheme (page color, text and link color) either manually or using CSS, the ability to add banners, logos, as well as video files and Java Script (for example, to support an online consultant) . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In addition to the attractive design of the payment acceptance page, it is also important to maximize the simplicity of its interface and to make sure that the payment procedure is understandable to anyone, even a novice user.  To do this, the page must contain the minimum number of required fields.  At the same time, the store owner, in turn, should be able to change the number of additional and mandatory fields, add explanatory information for each of them, and post a video explaining the filling procedure.  The presence of these opportunities will help create a page that will be clear to everyone, and at the same time will allow the store owner to get all the necessary information about their customers.  For example, in order to increase the effectiveness of store advertising campaigns, its owner can mark the ‚Äúcity‚Äù or ‚Äúhow did you hear about us?‚Äù Fields as mandatory, and, based on the information collected, make adjustments that will increase the effectiveness of your store's advertising campaigns. <br><br>  Often, buyers, choosing a product in the online store and starting to fill out a form on the payment page, are distracted and do not complete the purchase.  For example, a study by Bronto Software Inc showed that 50-70% of American online shoppers for various reasons, abandon the filled "basket" and have not completed the order.  However, many of them return to making the same purchase later.  In this regard, a function will be very useful, allowing the buyer to complete the initiated purchase without completing the entire order procedure, but only by supplementing the previously entered information.  This function notifies the buyer via e-mail that he made an order in the online store, but did not pay for it.  In order to make a payment, just click on the link in the letter and enter personal data.  In this case, there is the possibility of completing the payment by another available payment method other than the method of the first attempt.  The presence of the described functionality will certainly increase the likelihood that the buyer will still acquire the previously selected product, and the seller, accordingly, will receive a profit.

      Based on various statistical data, one of the most popular methods of online payments in Russia today is payment by means of a bank card.  In this regard, an important characteristic for an integrated payment system on the site is to ensure the minimum response time of the issuing bank when paying by credit card, as well as the largest possible number of acquiring banks that cooperate with a company that provides Internet processing services. payments.  This will allow buyers who are holders of cards of various banks to quickly make transactions to the online store. <br><br>  Of course, the list of the above functions and opportunities for changing the payment acceptance page is not exhaustive, and when choosing a processing payment center for an online store, other criteria must also be taken into account.  However, the development of a payment page with their account will allow to achieve the best result. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/143781/">https://habr.com/ru/post/143781/</a></p>
