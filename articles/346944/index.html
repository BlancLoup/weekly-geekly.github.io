  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The best white hackers earn 2.7 times more than average programmers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/my/jx/ch/myjxchn1h7ibcb0epgg-qrt2cn4.jpeg" align="left">  The <a href="https://www.hackerone.com/">HackerOne</a> community, which has more than 160,000 hackers registered and which has already paid $ 23.5 million for the found vulnerabilities, has published a report <a href="https://info.hacker.one/2018-hacker-report/">The 2018 Hacker Report</a> .  This is the largest ethical hacker survey in history, which was attended by 1,698 respondents.  Along with the results there is an interesting statistic. <br><br>  <b>Key results:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Awards for found bugs provide a decent life for top hackers.  On average, in all countries of the world, the difference in the "salary" of a top hacker and the median average salary of a programmer is 2.7 times, but the situation is different in different countries.  For example, in India the difference reaches 16x, in Argentina - 15.6x, in Latvia - 5.2x, in the USA - 2.7x, there is no salary statistics for Russia. </li><li>  Money is not the most important motivation of ethical hackers, this is only the fourth most popular (13.1%) reason for the work of hackers.  For more hackers, more important is the opportunity to learn technologies and tricks of work (14.7%), the ability to solve interesting problems (14%) and to have fun (14%).  Although back in 2016, money was the number 1 cause. </li><li>  India (23.3%) and the USA (19.9%) are two world leaders in the number of registered hackers.  They are followed by Russia (6.3%), Pakistan (4%) and the United Kingdom (4%). </li></ul><a name="habracut"></a><br><ul><li>  Almost every fourth hacker did not inform the company about the found vulnerability, because the company did not provide an opportunity (communication channel) how to report vulnerabilities. </li><li>  Almost 58% of all hacking specialists are self-taught.  Although 50% studied computer science / programming at the university, and 26.4% studied at school, only 5% said that these classes gave them at least some knowledge useful for hacking.  Until now, information security remains a rather rare specialty in universities, but on the Web you can find enough free information for self-education, including full-fledged textbooks on hacking sites (the HackerOne <a href="https://leanpub.com/web-hacking-101">Web Hacking 101</a> tutorial is distributed free of charge).  A great way to self-education is to study <a href="https://www.hackerone.com/blog/top-20-upvoted-reports-on-hacktivity">reports on real hacks.</a> </li><li>  Approximately 37% of survey participants engage in hacking as a hobby in their spare time, but 12% receive at least $ 20k per year from reward programs, and more than 3% earn from $ 100k per year, which is enough for a normal life in any country in the world.  1.1% earn more than $ 350k per year - and such a salary is almost impossible to get on a normal programmer‚Äôs job.  A quarter of hackers said that remuneration amounts to at least 50% of their income, while 13.7% have a 90-100% annual income. </li></ul><br>  It is interesting to look at the distribution of cash flows by country.  On the left of the chart - companies from which countries paid remuneration.  And on the right - the people from which countries received it

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lm/ib/ea/lmibea230udyitiebx02t7ohoyc.png"><br><br>  As we see, Russians are among the leaders and for the year earned $ 1,296,018. <br><br>  A typical hacker is a young, talented IT professional under 35 years old.  Almost half of all hackers have not yet reached 25 years.  In 75.1% of the hacking experience is only 1-5 years. <br><br>  46.7% of hackers work professionally in their field (IS specialists or programmers), and 25.3% are students.  About 13% said that they are engaged in hacking full time, that is, more than 40 hours a week. <br><br>  Interesting statistics on tools that hackers use.  Mostly now everyone specializes in a web platform, that is, hacking websites and web applications.  So, the most popular tools: <br><br><ul><li>  Burp Suite, an integrated platform for performing tests for web application security, which is included in the Kali Linux hacker OS suite - 29.3% </li><li>  Self-developed tools - 15.3% </li><li>  Web proxy / scanners - 12.6% </li><li>  Network vulnerability scanners - 11.8% </li><li>  Fuzzers - 9.9% </li><li>  Debuggers - 9.7% </li><li>  WebInspect - 5.4% </li><li>  Fiddler - 5.3% </li><li>  ChipWhisperer - 0.8% </li></ul><br>  After websites (70.8%), APIs (7.5%) and technologies, where the data of the hacker itself or where it is the user (5%), are followed by a hacking interest.  Operating systems are no longer as popular as a hacking target (3.1%), even behind Android applications (4.2%). <br><br>  Favorite attack vectors are XSS (28.8%), SQL injections (23.1%), fuzzing (5.5%) and brute force (4.5%). <br><br>  Most prefer to work alone, although many publish the results in their blog to get feedback from colleagues, and read their blogs. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/346944/">https://habr.com/ru/post/346944/</a></p>
