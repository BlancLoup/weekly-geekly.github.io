      For a start it is worth saying that the conference is international and Sun brings people of the most different.  Many reports in English.  Last year, they made simultaneous translation for free for those who have problems with languages.  For the sake of interest, I once took a plain stray to listen to the translation and ... turned off five minutes later.  You can listen, but the benefit of the level of English allows you to understand and live.  At the stands you can ask questions and chat with developers. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  On the subject of the conference </h4><br>  All reports go in three sections: <br>  1. ENTERPRISE COMPUTING - here you can listen about J2EE, Application Servers and other Enterprise solutions. <br>  2. CLIENT TECHNOLOGIES - here probably everything that was not included in other sections: JDK, Ajax, Web ... <br>  3. SOLARIS - here you can learn about OpenSolaris and administration. <br><br>  Mansion go MASTER CLASSES.  To my regret, I never hit them, but I heard that there‚Äôs really nothing to catch there.  It seems like there are a couple of small halls with Sanovskiy workstations on which everything shamelessly slows down (judging by the feedback from the visitors). <br><br><h4>  About the organization </h4><br>  Here we must pay tribute to the organizers.  Everything is usually on the highest level.  Yes, there are queues for registration ... but if we consider that in 2009 there were about 3,000 visitors, this can be taken as an inevitable evil.  When registering, they give out a questionnaire with standard questions who / from where / what technologies you use and at the end of the day you can exchange the questionnaire for pleasant souvenirs with symbols (backpacks / T-shirts / caps / scarves ...) In general, they give out souvenirs everywhere and a lot.  During reports to the crowd, they throw rubber ducks (Java mascot) just for good or for good questions.  During the break for lunch you can have a snack (free of charge) in the lounge-zone.  Food, of course, can be called a stretch, but still it is necessary to feed such a mob with something edible - you should try :) Be sure to invite some interesting musicians to entertain the crowd after the presentations.  Last year, invited Alexei Arkhipovsky.  If the name does not say anything - I recommend google and watch the video.  You even have little idea what he is doing with the balalaika :) <br><br><h4>  About useful :) </h4><br>  In addition to all the cute trinkets at the conference, you can find a lot of useful things.  To begin with - live communication with people involved in the development of fairly large and well-known products.  This year, James Gosling himself comes by the way.  Very smart guys at the booth MySQL.  It's fun to talk to the Indians :) They somehow clustered in the JavaME booth, JavaCard, SunSPOT and other hardware.  This year there will be a lot of reports from Oracle. <br><br>  I recommend to register in advance, registration is free but mandatory.  <a href="http://developers.sun.ru/techdays2010/registration/">developers.sun.ru/techdays2010/registration</a> <br><br>  And finally, a bit of PR :) On one of the stands this year there will be my report. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/85955/">https://habr.com/ru/post/85955/</a></p>
