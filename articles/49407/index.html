Interview with the creator of retaggr.com.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Personality 2.0.  Part One: Putting up a profile.  Interview with the creator of retaggr.com. <br><br>  In the ‚ÄúPersonality 2.0‚Äù series of posts we will try to figure out what a digital person is at the moment, what tools are there to work on your online look and get acquainted with the developers of interesting resources. <br>  In this post, we‚Äôll understand what the digital person still represents, how to collect all the bytes about you scattered in the network and, as a bonus, an interview with <a href="http://www.retaggr.com/">retaggr.com</a> founder Nick Smith. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  We collect the profile. </h3><br>  From <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_identity">Wikipedia</a> : <br><blockquote>  A digital identity is a social Internet identity that users use in online communities and on websites.  Although some people prefer to use their real name, most Internet users prefer fictional pseudonyms, which may contain some reliable data. </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7a3/815/ae5/7a3815ae5b82cc5280b999793c7958f5.jpg"><br>  However, the last statement that most individuals are fictional, has recently been losing weight.  Business is gradually filled with ‚Äúgeneration Y‚Äù, moves to the Internet and the whole thing is in trust.  If your profile does not inspire confidence in other Internet users, then it is not possible to use it in your career or personal goals. <br><br>  What are the components of a digital identity? <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/659/d83/aa5/659d83aa5ad320d1db06eb6156b6c681.jpg"><br>  You 2.0 is a set of specific components that make you recognizable to other users on the network: <br><ul><li>  avatar; </li><li>  content that you create on various resources; </li><li>  your contacts in various social networks; </li><li>  Profile - information that you voluntarily provide so that other people can identify and trust you when communicating online. </li></ul><br>  With the active use of the Internet and social networks, and at the moment the number of adult social network audience reached 35% in the US (Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project, January 2008, <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/pdfs/PIP_Adult_social_networking_data_memo_FINAL.pdf">http://www.pewinternet.org/pdfs/PIP_Adult_social_networking_data_memo_FINAL.pdf</a> ), sooner or later you have more than one profile.  In the same study, it was found that slightly more than half of users have more than one registered profile.  83% of them have profiles on other social networks. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/433/4b2/06f/4334b206f7bd6eccf51bd6e4c9697818.jpg"><br>  A simple example is, say, you are registered on facebook.com, vkontakte.ru, habrahabr.ru and flickr.com.  Each of these profiles and your content in these networks is an integral part of your digital ‚ÄúI‚Äù, but it is separate and inaccessible to users of ‚Äúalien‚Äù networks.  This is a nuisance.  If you decide to build a strong and true digital entity, then you need to know how to collect all the information about yourself, actively monitor what happens to your personal brand and influence its development.

      Let's start with how to collect all the information about yourself in a convenient place. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/aed/c51/b72/aedc51b721d078c6d5eb7085c51183e4.jpg"><br>  There are three types of services to do this: <br>  1. Collect your content (lifestreaming services): <a href="http://www.friendfeed.com/">www.friendfeed.com</a> , <a href="http://www.storytlr.com/">www.storytlr.com</a> , <a href="http://www.kakuteru.com/">www.kakuteru.com</a> , etc .; <br>  2. Collect your profiles: <a href="http://www.onxiam.com/">www.onxiam.com</a> , <a href="http://www.comwat.com/">www.comwat.com</a> , <a href="http://www.otherego.com/">www.otherego.com</a> , <a href="http://v2.profilebuilder.com/">v2.profilebuilder.com</a> , <a href="http://www.profileomat.com/">www.profileomat.com</a> , <a href="http://www.socialurl.com/">www.socialurl.com</a> , <a href="http://venyo.org/">venyo.org</a> , <a href="http://www.zoolit.com/">www.zoolit. com</a> , etc.  (open all sites at once <a href="http://krunchd.com/profile_management">krunchd.com/profile_management</a> ); <br>  3. Collect both profiles and content: <a href="http://www.retaggr.com/">www.retaggr.com</a> . <br><br>  The first type of aggregator presents your content as a stream of Internet activity.  However, on the same friendfeed profile, scanty and does not provide sufficient information about the user.  The second type collects information from your profiles, but is inconvenient to use, because  it is not known what you do on the Internet after all.  Facebook is trying to fill the third type of digital identity collector niche, but it doesn‚Äôt make it easy to import other profiles. <br>  Retaggr solves the problem quite easily - ‚Äújust give him your nickname, and they will do everything for you‚Äù (Nick Smith, the creator of retaggr.com).  This service not only collects content and profiles, but also allows you to contact you by any convenient means. <br><br>  There are several ways to use the retaggr hyper profile. <br>  1. <a href="http://www.retaggr.com/card/SashaKovaliov">www.retaggr.com/card/SashaKovaliov</a> <br>  2. Widget: for example, as on my <a href="http://nlupus.tumblr.com/">tag</a> <br>  3. Signature for letters: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b49/eb8/34d/b49eb834d3c1518a779614b92d4a0c10.jpg"><br>  4. Button "add me": <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e11/025/7b9/e110257b92238dfe24eba3852174edc2.jpg">  which will help users find you on all services where you are registered: <a href="http://www.retaggr.com/AddMe/SashaKovaliov">www.retaggr.com/AddMe/SashaKovaliov</a> <br>  5. Personal profile page that you can transfer to your domain, for example, <a href="http://www.sashakovaliov.com/">www.sashakovaliov.com</a> . <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/102/056/1cf/1020561cf71b487594a16e62c48e20a6.jpg"><br><br>  Advantages of the hyper profile: <br>  1. All information in one place, i.e.  There is no need to visit additional sites. <br>  2. Clear and inclusive personality 2.0. <br>  3. The ability to contact you by any convenient means. <br>  4. Easy to advertise. <br><br>  Disadvantages: <br>  1. All information about you can not be good, so you need to expend efforts on additional monitoring. <br>  2. If you have several digital personalities, you will have to decide who you still want to be. <br>  3. If you do not have paranoia, then there is no third paragraph.  ;) <br><br>  I am sure that many faced the problem of fragmentation of personal information.  Sometimes to collect everything in one convenient place we take a lot of time and effort (development of custom private sites).  Having always on hand a business card 2.0, which on the move will stun your new employer or client is undoubtedly an advantage. <br><br>  Where and how do you aggregate personal information?  Do you work on your online image?  Leave comments after the interview. <br><br><h3>  Interview with the creator of retaggr.com <br></h3><br>  I found the retaggr.com service quite a long time ago, and helped in testing new features (widget, button, and hyper-profile page).  We met with creator <a href="http://niksmit.me/">Nick Smith</a> on <a href="http://twitter.com/niksmit">twitter</a> .  The following is a translation of the Skype interview: <br><br>  <strong>In short, what retaggr is and how it helps internet users.</strong> <br>  - Retaggr is an aggregator of social activity and user profiles.  With it, you can learn about a person almost everything in a few seconds.  You can also contact him using the built-in widgets. <br><br>  <strong>How is retaggr different from other similar services?</strong> <br>  - Retaggr collects not only user information (profiles), but also its Internet activity.  We provide various ways of locating a precast profile online, and not just using a website. <br>  <strong>Whose idea is it and how was it born?</strong> <br>  - Facebook has a function with which you can tag your friends in photos.  The first feature of retaggr.com was precisely this feature (it is available now).  Later, as the project grew, we came to the conclusion that we need to create a more comprehensive and convenient profile for active Internet users. <br><br>  <strong>Are there any technical problems when dealing with such a huge variety of resources?</strong> <br>  -Oh yeah!  These are primarily various APIs that vary across all services.  Having implemented functionality for one site, you have to learn the API of another site from scratch.  We use <a href="http://gnipcentral.com/">gnipcentral.com</a> to use other services' APIs as much as possible.  And they greatly facilitate our work! <br><br>  <strong>How many people work on the project and what methodology do you use?</strong> <br>  - There are 4 people in the team.  3 developers and one person involved in marketing.  We use different agile methodologies, because today it‚Äôs simply impossible to develop a quality resource in another way.  The user is always right!  When opening retaggr, we started receiving just a myriad of letters with feedback and offers.  Well, you know on our own how quickly we fix the flaws in retaggr and add new functionality :).  Interestingly, we have a very large number of users in Italy, although we are an English site.  From them comes a huge amount of information on how to improve the resource.  Many users ask to add retaggr versions in other languages. <br><br>  <strong>Well here to help crowdsourcing?</strong>  <strong>After all, this is the fastest and most efficient way to transfer now: facebook.com, myopera community ...</strong> <br>  - Of course.  This is what we plan to do in the near future. <br><br>  <strong>The most acute problem for web 2.0 services is competent monetization.</strong>  <strong>Does retaggr have a plan?</strong> <br>  - Yes, as you see today we opened a personal profile page, which will be free for the first two months for everyone, and then we will start selling this functionality.  In the future, we are planning several more ways to monetize, but so far I can not tell about them. <br><br>  <strong>Do you plan to release a mobile version?</strong> <br>  - Yes.  Mobile industry is one of the most developing and is of great interest in terms of controlling a digital personality.  The traditional business card, in the form in which it exists now is undoubtedly good, but there are some points that I would like to improve. <br><br>  <strong>Do you plan to integrate retaggr into Firefox via the plugin and Outlook or any other mailer?</strong> <br>  - Yes.  This is also in our plans.  But now I can't tell you about them either :).  Firefox ... probably Flock will be the most efficient browser for retaggr implementation.  At the moment we have Greasemonkey scripts for sites like twitter and friendfeed, and they are very popular.  In general, yes, it would be great to make a plugin for Firefox. <br><br>  <strong>OK.</strong>  <strong>What are your plans for the near and distant future?</strong> <br>  - As you already know, we launched a personal profile page and premium service.  These two months, we will monitor how users are satisfied with their profile.  We want the hyper profile page to be something that you can be proud of and you would include it in your paper business card and link to anyone interested in you.  So we will work on that. <br><br>  - We also plan to introduce Facebook Connect and become an OpenID provider, develop a mobile version.  Our next steps are aimed at everything related to the digital identity and user presence on the Internet. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/49407/">https://habr.com/ru/post/49407/</a></p>
