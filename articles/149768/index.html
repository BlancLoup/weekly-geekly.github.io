R2D2 turns on its projector, and a three-dimensional image of a princess in distress appears in the air.  Do you think this is fantastic?  However, such technologies are available now.  And they were not created somewhere abroad, but here in Russia. <br><br>  In 2011, the <a href="http://www.displair.ru/">DisplAir</a> project became the winner of the Technovations Cup.  Its essence lies in the projection of the image on the treated air flow.  The result is a three-dimensional picture that can be rotated using multi-touch gestures.  But it is better to see once than hear a hundred times: <br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/QSCO4di-E3U%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgIM_ZgR18m76rabxyr8Ucb44V-kw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The project is now actively developing.  A couple of months ago, he received a million dollar investment.  In the fall, it is planned to launch active sales of equipment and services.

      I talked about the main stages of the development of the project and the peculiarities of technological entrepreneurship with Maxim Kamanin, the founder and leader of the project: <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Yuri Bryzgalov: How was the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe project born?</b> <br>  Maxim Kamanin: In 2009, I talked with my colleagues and classmates about the technologies of the future, what awaits us.  Among other things, one of the topics that caught the minds was a discussion of airborne imaging technologies, holograms and other such things.  As usual, everyone talked and forgotten. <br><br>  A few days later, in the temple, where I served as a sub-deacon with the bishop, looking at the fluctuations of air over a hot candle, I got the idea to develop a project in the field of projecting an image on a stream of treated air. <br><br>  <b>Yuri Bryzgalov: An unexpected source of ideas.</b>  <b>What were the first steps?</b> <br>  Maxim Kamanin: I began to study existing technologies in the market and competitors.  At that time, there were already American Io2technology and FogScreen. <br><br>  There were several speeches at the Astrakhan scientific conferences, where professors said: ‚ÄúMaxim, you are an idealist.  Can't project images in the air. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Yuri Bryzgalov: And when was the practical implementation?</b> <br>  Maxim Kamanin: On the eve of 2010, I had a theoretical base, and a project was formed.  I registered with him on the Seliger Forum.  They called me and said that if I make a working prototype, they will put it in a tent, which President Medvedev will visit.  Before the forum, there were literally a couple of weeks, there was almost no practical experience, but the challenge was accepted.  With the help of his father and brother, the first prototype was assembled.  It was a rough sample, but it was already working, and some kind of picture in the air flickered. <br><br>  At Seliger, my wife Svetlana sneaked past the FSO to Medvedev himself and invited her to look at DisplAir.  He liked the project very much.  Due to this, he received all-Russian publicity, support from the regional government.  And from that moment began its active development. <br><br>  <b>Yuri Bryzgalov: How was the project team going?</b> <br>  Maxim Kamanin: Mostly from the contacts I had in Astrakhan, and also appeared in the course of communication on forums and conferences.  At the beginning there was no money.  The main part of the guys worked on enthusiasm.  It was the developer who made the first version of the multi-touch, the designer who left his job and became our technical director, and others. <br><br>  Financial difficulties were very hard.  Fortunately, the wife and relatives understood and supported everything. <br><br>  Now we have 52 people.  Mainly software developers, design engineers and hardware builders. <br><br>  <b>Yury Bryzgalov: What key stages can be distinguished in the development of the project?</b> <br>  Maxim Kamanin: The first is Seliger in July 2010. <br><br>  The second is the autumn of 2011, when the project won the Technovations Cup, the Sarov-2011 competition, won the Zvorykin Prize, etc. The main thing in these victories is that we were able to publish in the international media, tell people about our project.  We watched YouTube statistics about our video.  He was looked everywhere, except for the countries of Central Africa, Pakistan and Antarctica. <br><br>  After these publications, our mentor and advisor Adrian Henny, editor-in-chief of <a href="http://ewdn.com/">EWDN.com,</a> came to us.  He did a great job of preparing presentation materials and attracting first investors. <br><br>  The third stage is May 2012, when we closed the first million dollar investment round. <br><br>  <b>Yury Bryzgalov: What is the business model of the project now?</b> <br>  Maxim Kamanin: This is the sale and rental of equipment, as well as software development.  Together with the device comes a set of software, but if the user wants a personal wow effect, then additional development is needed. <br><br>  <b>Yuri Bryzgalov: And who are your customers?</b> <br>  Maxim Kamanin: First of all, these are companies, not users.  We enter the market through a niche advertising business.  Now there are negotiations with large companies in France, which are ready to order thousands of devices at once. <br><br>  <b>Yuri Bryzgalov: How do you plan to spend the investment?</b> <br>  Maxim Kamanin: First, this is the revision of the prototype to the commercial version.  Secondly, the preparation of the market in order to form an international network, and not to sell for two devices in its region. <br><br>  <b>Yuri Bryzgalov: What helped to get the investment?</b> <br>  Maxim Kamanin: Publications have played a big role.  When we invited to the investment session, the first persons of the companies came to meet with the already well-known project, and not just a startup.  They could already make decisions on the spot. <br><br>  We have a situation where there is no shortage of investors.  We can choose smart money, that is, those who are willing to grow the project, have sufficient experience and contacts. <br><br>  But it is now.  And we started with the spirit of ‚ÄúWho would give us at least something‚Äú.  We asked for 30 million rubles and were ready to give almost 50% of the company.  But with the growing understanding of European standards, not Russian, we realized that there is better.  If we then gave 40% to one investor, then no European would have invested in our project.  Then it would be difficult to agree on the next round of investment in the project, where one of the investors already has the lion‚Äôs share.  Good investors, it is important that the team itself retains control on the project. <br><br>  <b>Yuri Bryzgalov: What are your plans for the next six months?</b> <br>  Maxim Kamanin: Now we are finalizing the equipment.  Commercial project should be more reliable.  Plus, we develop a module of odors.  The processed air stream with particles of moisture can be flavored to be used in cosmetics advertising.  It will be not just a set of modules, but a blender type, where the user can create his own blends. <br><br>  By November, we should launch a semi-industrial series and the sale of the first DisplAir. <br><br>  <b>Yuri Bryzgalov: And where are you going to produce equipment?</b> <br>  Maxim Kamanin: We are fundamentally positioned as a Russian company.  The assembly remains in Russia.  Naturally, we simply have to buy components abroad, because we do not have them, or they are too expensive. <br><br>  We plan to apply for accommodation in the special economic zone of Zelenograd to accommodate production there. <br><br>  <b>Yuri Bryzgalov: Is this patriotism or economic calculation?</b> <br>  Maxim Kamanin: In many ways, patriotism.  In the beginning there was an opportunity to sell the project for decent money, for example, to the United Arab Emirates or a large European concern, but it was decided to develop the project as a Russian development that will be used all over the world. <br>  = = = <br><br>  On August 20, a DisplAir for developers on programming for multi-touch interfaces is held in Astrakhan.  It is also available in webinar format. <br>  You can learn more and submit a request by mail d.tikhomirov@displair.com. <br><br>  In addition, until September 3, there is a competition for product design.  The winner gets a contract for the design and iPad with a retina display. <br>  More in the first message. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/149768/">https://habr.com/ru/post/149768/</a></p>
