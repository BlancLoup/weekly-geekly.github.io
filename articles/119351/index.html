HOORAY!  In fact, this is a regular application, it is available through the App Store, it can be easily downloaded and installed on any iPad.  But it looks like an e-book with live interactive pictures, so you can not just read it, but also take an active part in the life of the characters. <br>  We were inspired by the highly acclaimed Alice for the iPad book in the App Store.  You must admit that it is very nice when the illustrations in the book are not just alive, but also interactive, when you can tap on them and change something there. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/02a22475/19e75378/da958182/ce5365a6.jpg"><br>  The tale ‚ÄúThe Egoist Giant‚Äù was not chosen by chance, we were guided by a number of facts: the popularity of Wilde‚Äôs tales, the lack of copyright to the original text, and the opportunity to make our own translation into Russian, plus this book perfectly suited the style of our artist‚Äôs works.  And if the first project succeeds, we still have the opportunity to release a whole series of Oscar Wilde's fairy tales. <br>  So, as they say, God himself commanded. <br><br>  The development itself did not take us much time, since the fairy tale was chosen short and we did not set ourselves some absolutely insane goals.  More difficulties were encountered on the path of comprehending and fighting the Cocos2D engine, on which the application was made.  But our programmer did an excellent job with them.  Although some nice baubles still had to be abandoned.

Tenniel, but we created our unique art with more interesting plot animation and it‚Äôs worth a lot. <br>  The main artist of the project Andrei Klenin - <a href="http://www.itales.ru/">iTales</a> - has been working in the world of MMPORG for a long time, and he draws very coolly in the style of Oscar Wilde. <br><br>  You can personally verify this: <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/bRDDgcuFsZw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhiK1dnGb82VOLTY8dBaICDUxdS16Q" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  ‚ÄúAlice‚Äù has one plus - the general stylistic unity, to which we aspired, but from which in a number of small details still moved.  However, unlike Alice, we have our own unique features in animations.  In addition, we added elements of the game to the fairy tale, although we tried not to overdo them - because the book should still be a book, and Wilde‚Äôs text should be the main character.  That is Wilde is a soloist, and we, in fact, have tried to be good accompanists. <br><br>  Unfortunately, in the gaming industry, much is determined by commercial considerations, i.e.  Much has to be done reluctantly and stepping on the throat of his own song.  The same project was made by us simply ‚Äúfor the soul‚Äù.  He is our attempt to sow "reasonable, good, eternal."  And what will come of it - time will tell. <br>  The result of our team can be viewed in <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/selfish-giant/id432309257">iTunes</a> . <br><br>  And better to <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/selfish-giant/id432309257">download and install on your iPad</a> .  (the first few pages are available for free, which give a general impression of the book) <br><br>  We will be extremely grateful for any feedback and advice :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/119351/">https://habr.com/ru/post/119351/</a></p>
