At that time, "Ritmer" was presented as a budding medical technology, which came from the military sphere and was part of the outfit of the future "Warrior" soldier. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fv/fe/ay/fvfeayjt7mon8csd_xvr9gfycbc.jpeg"><br><br>  Much has been declared ... The official site still has the ‚Äútable of advantages‚Äù that does not include the civilian version.  In general, we wanted to create a wearable holter, but it turned out Ritmer.  Nevertheless, we offer a closer look at it. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  First of all, it‚Äôs worth the price right away.  <a href="https://medgadgets.ru/shop/ritmer-personal-nyj-kardioregistrator.html%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dritmer%26utm_campaign%3Dritmer">12 290 rubles</a> .  And if the functionality was fully implemented by the current moment, it would be justified.  In particular, in the table where they are compared: Cheap fitness trackers |  Expensive fitness trackers |  Medical Cardiac Monitors |  Ritmer can meet this column:

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ho/tl/pz/hotlpzdx9ca0blfdx6t3retmp0c.png"><br><br>  However, this is far from what one would expect after such words.  For example, the level of stress that is analyzed for you ultimately looks like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sf/3b/p5/sf3bp56ka8w5rk3nfdlrm7ffowi.jpeg"><br><br>  In other words, you get some description of the parameter + traffic light scale with a range of numbers and a short explanation of what these figures could indicate.  It is clear why and why this was done, but it is not clear why this is called ‚ÄúClear recommendations‚Äù. <br><br>  Also under the recommendations gets a paragraph on the main page of the application, which goes immediately after the statistics. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0r/ga/3s/0rga3s0jkbtejnjw9mora3iuo94.png"><br><br>  But this again: ‚ÄúKeep up the good work!‚Äù However, here you can also find a mobile phone number for deeper detailing, where you will be consulted, and this also seems to be appropriate for ‚ÄúClear Recommendations‚Äù, but there is nothing in the application. <br><br>  Total "Ritmer" analyzes the body in 6 ways: <br><br><ul><li>  Heart rate </li><li>  Cardiac activity </li><li>  Stress </li><li>  Power reserve </li><li>  Recuperation speed </li><li>  Backup power source </li></ul><br>  All these parameters are stored on the main screen, and access to specific dates and specific results is ‚Äúturned over‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jv/ld/xs/jvldxsrf2bhobnlhhc6fgaxllxk.gif"><br><br>  Inside each individual parameter can be accessed by clicking: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/21/7n/o-/217no-xvd49vu-z_dnydzoet3nq.gif"><br><br>  There is also a scale by day from measurement to measurement and an explanatory ‚Äútraffic light‚Äù with a general description of the parameter. <br><br>  It is curious that the number of measured parameters varies depending on how you perform the measurement. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wo/w0/uy/wow0uy_v9qva2ual59pnx4a3xek.jpeg"><br><br>  As can be seen from the explanation, an incomplete schedule is built up due to the fact that a person can be in a state of activity.  And in this case, there is another question to the so-called monitoring 24/7, which is stated in the benefits. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/5k/np/5g/5knp5gjfhl38zox2qxx5evpwsfg.png"><br><br>  Firstly, it should be clarified that this type of monitoring should be understood that you can wear a ‚ÄúRitmer‚Äù 24 hours a day, but at the same time only two options are available for automatic monitoring: once every half hour and once an hour.  This can be controlled in the settings. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/l-/nx/o5/l-nxo5c8jv_aapnicscwjwhzone.png"><br><br>  And, of course, the value of incomplete analysis is somewhat reduced, and it is also quite difficult to spend the whole day lying in bed for half-hour intervals.  At the same time, the smartphone to which the Ritmer is connected must be located nearby, otherwise: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ak/vv/bw/akvvbwlytfi0ldxifaprycxh8aa.png"><br><br>  However, the device works not only at a given interval.  By clicking on the "Record" button you can manually start the measurement mode.  It lasts 5 minutes, during which it is required to remain in a motionless state. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/i3/q9/9p/i3q99pfar4qmcl2ji2b2ras5q4o.gif"><br><br>  In this case, as a result, you will receive, for example, on the HR parameter - one averaged figure for the given period and, in addition, it is also impossible to monitor the pulse in real time for 5 minutes. <br><br>  Wishing to protect themselves and shield them from unnecessary questions from the registration authorities, the developers of the civilian version have removed quite a lot of competitive advantages from Ritmer, which would make it unique and promise that everything will be fully operational with the RU.  We are waiting, sir. <br><br><blockquote>  And while we wait, we have: an episodic heart rate monitor, which, according to the results of five-minute studies, provides statistics on six parameters of health, which are detected on the basis of the pulse and heart rate variability for 12,290 rubles. </blockquote><br>  Fastening "Ritmer" in two ways: there is a chest strap and electrodes included. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Ritmer mount</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/6a/vj/jc/6avjjckib3uucoaodln425l9huy.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rp/hx/on/rphxon19bthwvl3ci3lg9z4yldu.jpeg"><br></div></div><br>  But more comfortable, oddly enough, to fasten it with a belt: the electrodes are terribly sticky, so tearing them off your chest is still a pleasure. <br><br>  The package bundle, it should be noted, is not bad, Ritmer is packed soundly. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qq/tg/qz/qqtgqzwcb2swcvhgv5aspb6xwom.jpeg"><br><br>  Inside the box are instructions and consumables.  In addition to the belt and electrodes, there is also a docking station, cable and adapter. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hb/52/wi/hb52wiyuhimxzgqxhq4aknu-nb4.jpeg"><br><br>  The gadget is placed on the docking station after which it connects to the network.  The solution is quite cumbersome, given that constructively Ritmer could easily accommodate another connector. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1z/gq/jg/1zgqjgp6rpicn-ybqmklilgvrke.jpeg"><br><br>  And, by the way, there is such a connector, though its purpose is not explained in the instructions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/i8/uk/ki/i8ukki0fbwe8nmcwrulx6oll9z4.jpeg"><br><br>  In general, in the end, we have a rather strange heart rate monitor, which performs simple analytics in automatic mode or on request.  The gadget was really represented to the president: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pz/v0/zb/pzv0zbt3h6hnq7vohno_v2jgmlq.gif"><br><br>  However, if you look closely, then in the plot the device is not white, and therefore, probably not the civilian version of ‚ÄúRitmer‚Äù, which has reached us. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/s2/n4/uc/s2n4ucfbnhvgmgobktpgb98lby4.png"><br><br>  We still have a rather controversial device, which works under certain conditions, and also guarantees clinical accuracy, without being formally medical equipment. <br><br>  Oh yes.  One of the features of "Ritmer" is that you can assign observers to your indicators by adding them to the menu of the gadget. <br><br>  Take care of yourself! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/422901/">https://habr.com/ru/post/422901/</a></p>
