      Alas, today it is <b>problematic</b> for residents of the CIS countries <b>to</b> start a crowdfunding company on the well-known Kickstarter platform for a number of requirements of the platform itself. <br><br>  According to the Kickstarter Terms of Use, the creation of a project on the platform is available to individuals from the USA, UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Denmark, Ireland, Norway, Sweden and Germany who meet the <b>following criteria:</b> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><ul><li>  Age - 18+ </li><li>  The presence of permanent residence in the country where the project is created (see list of countries above) </li><li>  Local address (analogy of our registration, ‚Äúregistration‚Äù), in the country where the project is being created </li><li>  Having a local bank account in the country where the project is being created </li><li>  Having a passport of the country in which the project is being created (for EU citizens, the EU passport) </li><li>  Presence of a credit or debit card </li></ul><br>  Many entrepreneurs are mistaken in thinking that by creating a company in one of the countries listed above, they will be able to satisfy Kickstarter‚Äôs requirements and launch a project there. <br><br>  No, it is not.  Shareholders / founders of companies on whose behalf a crowdfunding company will be initiated <b>are subject to the same requirements as those described above for individuals.</b> <br><br><h4>  Solutions </h4><br><ol><li>  Search for a business partner abroad that meets the requirements of Kickstarter and will launch a crowdfunding company on its own behalf.  You need to find a person or a company, and it's not that difficult.  It is more difficult to legally arrange everything in such a way that you are not "thrown".  There are both legal and technical capabilities.  Contracts, restrictions on access to a bank account, etc. <br><br>  <i><u>Comment:</u> It is hard to find, easy to lose and impossible to forget (c) the Internet</i> </li><li>  Search for intermediary services that post projects on their own behalf.  It is easy to find such services, but you shouldn‚Äôt trust everyone.  Carefully read the documentation and get legal guarantees that you will not be deceived.  From my own experience, I know that there are a lot of dishonest services spinning around crowdfunding, which offer ‚Äúpromotion to the top on Kickstarter itself‚Äù, ‚Äúlarge-scale tweeter and FB publications‚Äù, etc.  - Of these, 99% are Internet fraudsters, who for the most part, unfortunately, operate within the law. <br><br>  <i><u>Comment:</u> I have not done in-depth analysis of such services and will not advise any of those encountered.</i>  <i>If someone has a negative or positive experience, I will be glad to hear about him in the comments.</i> </li><li>  Moving to another country and obtaining permanent resident status. <br><br>  <i><u>Comment:</u> not sure what it is worth doing to launch a project on Kickstarter</i> </li><li>  Use of other crowdfunding platforms.  As for me, the same IndieGoGo is quite convenient and popular.  In fact, there is little point in relying on the organic traffic of the platform itself when launching a crowdfunding project.  All popularity depends on how demanded your project is and what kind of audience you have covered and notified.  The same Skully showed good results on IndieGoGo. <br><br>  <i><u>Comment:</u> It seems to me that it is better not to waste time on meeting the requirements of Kickstarter and run on another platform.</i>  <i>But I will be glad to hear your opinion.</i> </li></ol><br><br>  Thanks for attention. <br><br>  I hope the information will be useful! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/290354/">https://habr.com/ru/post/290354/</a></p>
