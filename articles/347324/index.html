If the user wants to get a number that will not be displayed to everyone, you will have to pay for it.  The price depends on the rental period of the number and country code - and can vary within very wide limits from a couple hundred rubles to $ 30 and above. <br><br>  It is clear that an ordinary user who does not want to ‚Äúshine‚Äù his number and receive spam in the form of SMS, at the same time underestimates security and uses free, temporary and <i>publicly available</i> services.  Usually, this is motivated by ‚Äúe-mail is enough for me to recover the password‚Äù, ‚ÄúI will not use it anyway,‚Äù etc. <br><br><h3>  Risks and description of the attack </h3><br>  The risks in this situation are obvious: an attacker can read SMS, like any other visitor to the site of free numbers.  This means that the password recovery procedure can be initiated on the account page by sending the code to the associated phone number ‚Äî after which access is easily obtained. <br><br>  After gaining access, an attacker can easily change email addresses and phone number, and thus completely seize the victim‚Äôs account. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dt/2u/yr/dt2uyrc88c29dmcf8rtjvtofwnu.jpeg"><br><br>  Since updating the list of free numbers is sometimes done quite rarely - every few months - an attacker can find a lot of quite interesting information accumulated by the victim during this period. <br><br><h3>  Our little analysis </h3><br>  We tried to use the specified mechanism and get access to some accounts. <br><br>  We found the following main cases of the use of free SMS services with the ability to gain access. <br><br><ul><li>  Social networks and dating services.  In this case, access is fairly easy, especially if the user has not installed an additional security check.  It should be said that most of the accounts were used for fraud and were blocked, but in some cases they were fully used, sometimes even with activated paid services.  Especially in this case, users of dating services, such as <a href="https://www.mamba.ru/">Mamba</a> , are vulnerable, since additional security on these resources is simply not provided, and the correspondence contains quite a lot of sensitive information that can easily be used for blackmail. </li><li>  Register Viber, WhatsApp, etc.  Despite the obviousness of the fact that after the ‚Äúobsolescence‚Äù of a toll free number the user can easily lose access to his account, we found quite a lot of actively used accounts.  Risks in this case are completely analogous to social networks - all delicate correspondence, as well as photos can be prey to the attacker. </li><li>  Use of various Internet services.  Very often the username and password were sent to the number, and therefore access was obtained absolutely without problems.  We did not set the task to break the record for the amount of money on services, moreover - we did not use a single penny, but the money was: </li><li>  Fraud  Especially in this regard, taxi drivers were pleased: the overwhelming number of uchetok, which were obtained using free virtual numbers and tested by us, matched the drivers, but not the passengers.  It seemed logical to us: it is unlikely that the passenger wants the driver to get through to him, but the driver very often dials from another number, ‚Äúbecause the phone has sat down,‚Äù etc.  Such schemes allow you to re-zero the rating, use several cars, etc. <br><br>  We also noted a lot of text messages related to issuing credit cards, obtaining loans, etc. </li><li>  Registration of insurance policies, loyalty program cards, etc. </li></ul><br><h3>  findings </h3><br>  Apparently, users are not sufficiently aware of the criticality of using free virtual numbers for registering various accounts and other services.  This can be somehow explained in cases where the number is used to test such registration (although the testing process itself cannot be convenient, since anyone can ‚Äústeal‚Äù the accounting record obtained in this way and interrupt the course of work), but it cannot be justified in any way. cases where such registration will be seriously used later. <br><br>  It's funny that despite the fact that many services check the association of a number to VoIP services (for example, it will not be possible to register using numbers associated with Google Voice / Hangouts), but we don‚Äôt know such verification of binding to toll-free virtual numbers ‚Äî although such verification could easily be carried out by simply calling the number. <br><br>  This applies not only to social networks, but also to banking and credit organizations - of course, they use other methods of checks, but in terms of free SMS services - a complete breach. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0n/ad/_d/0nad_dbfkonn3o837c4equoabdo.jpeg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/347324/">https://habr.com/ru/post/347324/</a></p>
