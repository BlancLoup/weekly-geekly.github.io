  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Licensed movie appeared on Rutube</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today, the video portal <a href="http://rutube.ru/">Rutube.ru</a> and the Russian film company Russian World Studios (RWS) have announced the signing of a strategic agreement on the joint promotion of film production.  The partners agreed on an exclusive announcement of the films produced by RWS in the partner network of the Russian clone YouTube. <br><br>  Now users can see fragments of future Russian blockbusters, working moments from film sets and scenes not included in the movie several months before the premiere.  The first trial clips from the upcoming comedy action movie ‚ÄúAntidur‚Äù produced by RWS have already been included in the list of the most popular stories on the site: they were watched by several thousand people. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Why did RWS take such a step?  The fact is that this film company had previously differed in a not very typical approach to the distribution of its films.  In particular, some of her films, which have already been broadcast on TV, several months ago were fully posted on the Internet at the initiative of the company.  As a result, they were watched by tens of thousands of Internet viewers, which contributed to maintaining high ratings during repeated demonstrations of this content on TV in high resolution and convenient viewing mode for a mass audience. <br><br>  Galina Kononova, head of the affiliate program at Rutube.ru, says: ‚ÄúWe are very pleased that our partners, representatives of such a traditional industry as the film industry, have taken such a progressive position in distributing their content on the Internet.  Studio RWS before their Western colleagues realized that video portals do not compete with cinemas.  As a result, we received exclusive materials from film sets, shots that were not included in the final version of the film, and a regular partner in the field of the most current visual art, which for us is cinema. ‚Äù

      Askar Tuganbaev (producer Rutube.ru): ‚ÄúThe people always wanted bread and circuses.  With bread, everything is clear: eating homemade food, fast food, restaurants, etc., and with shows until recently, it was more difficult - there is a home theater, multiplex too, and television was more like a Soviet-style diet cafeteria.  Now we have agreed with filmmakers, and sell their products to take away.  Nobody can help - to watch a movie in high quality, a gourmet will buy a DVD or go to the cinema, and you can try the video to taste and decide whether it is worth your attention on Rutube.ru.  It is very honest and courageous. ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/b57/62c/7b8/b5762c7b81319d3a4590d49fb3e86ec1.gif" width="422" height="394" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  <i>According to the press release of the company</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/12758/">https://habr.com/ru/post/12758/</a></p>
