Such fines are sometimes issued unfairly, but it is difficult to challenge them to an ordinary person on their own, and the services of a lawyer will cost more than the fine itself.

      At the moment, the chat bot has successfully helped to challenge more than 160 thousand fines in London and New York.  At the same time, this ‚Äúlawyer‚Äù works absolutely free of charge, demonstrating the benefits that chat bots can bring.  The creator calls his service "the world's first law robot."  The interface here is quite simple - in fact, a child can work with it. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  First, the service asks the user a series of suggestive questions that allow you to find out whether in the current situation it is possible to appeal the fine.  Such questions include, for example, the item ‚ÄúAre parking signs visible?‚Äù.  After the user answers all the questions, and it turns out that you can appeal, the service helps you go through this procedure. <br><br>  The results of the bot are really impressive.  Of the 250,000 appeals, 160,000 were successful. Thus, the effectiveness of the service is 64%.  The amount of successfully challenged fines is already $ 4 million. <br><br>  ‚ÄúI think that people who receive parking fines are the most vulnerable in society.  These people do not break the law.  It seems to me that the government uses them as a source of income, ‚Äùsays Joshua Browder.  Every year in the UK they collect fines of about a billion dollars. <br><br>  Browder knows what he is talking about.  A year ago, he himself received about 30 fines.  Then the developer was only 18 years old, and he just started driving around London in his own car.  Browder argues that the process of filing an appeal is a template, this procedure is ideal for the bot to work. <br><br>  "Hello.  I would like to tell you that I successfully returned a parking penalty to Bromley using this site.  The designations [parking - ed.] Were confusing.  The officials stated that they did not receive my appeal and demanded to pay the fine in full.  However, I applied for a personal presence at the appeal hearing.  After I received a written confirmation of the possibility of being present at the trial, I received an official letter from Bromley, which said that the officials would appeal the appeal.  Perseverance helped win the process!  Thank you for your help, ‚Äù- says one of the letters of thanks received by the creator of the service. <br><br>  Indeed, thanks are for what, since the appeal procedure takes only about half a minute. <br><br>  Now Browder plans to expand the geography of the presence of his <a href="http://www.donotpay.co.uk/home.php">DoNotPay</a> service in Seattle.  But now, apart from challenging the parking fines, he decided to take on the airlines.  The bot is scheduled to train the submission of applications for compensation for flight delays.  Also, the developer is going to help people with HIV to learn their own rights, and refugees - to understand the intricate legislation of other countries. <br><br>  At the same time, Browder is working on creating a platform that will allow anyone to develop his own bot who understands the law.  Such a platform can be especially useful for lawyers. <br><br><twitter-widget class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered" id="twitter-widget-0" style="position: absolute; visibility: hidden; display: block; transform: rotate(0deg); max-width: 100%; width: 500px; min-width: 220px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"></twitter-widget><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="ru" data-twitter-extracted-i1551433095034702426="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">  Yes!
