On the experience of using the service, on the so-called.  ‚ÄúCheck-ins‚Äù, about the institutions and the people who visit them, are increasingly written by Russian bloggers.  And now, it seems, representatives of the Russian business have gradually begun to turn their eyes on this social network. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Offline companies of all calibers, in the days of the emergence of social networks, did not seriously consider them as a marketing or business tool.  But as the popularity of social networks grew, the situation gradually changed, and now there is hardly a person who will deny the impact of social networks on consumers and the companies themselves.  And geosocial networks, in particular, become a link between a society living in a network and a business in real life. <br><br>  The Foursquare geosocial network brings together consumers in different cities, and is a mixture of geolocation and game service.  Each institution can have its address on the social network, thereby announcing its existence to other users.  After that, the owners of the institution will be able to announce special offers and new products, as well as simply communicate with their visitors.  An ordinary person service will offer to visit interesting places or places that are nearby.  When visiting these places, the user is invited to make marks (‚Äúcheck-in‚Äù), for which points are awarded.  Visitors who celebrate at the establishment will be able to share information with each other about the quality of the service, advise each other to try delicious dishes, watch interesting films, etc.  The most active users of the service receive various bonuses and discounts from the owners of the places they visit. <br><br>  In Russia, Foursquare has not been widely distributed for a long time.  An important role in this was played by domestic businessmen, who are often reluctant to accept innovation.  As well as the domestic equivalent of the service - AlterGeo, which has more than 1,000 partners in Russia.  But in the near future everything can change drastically.

      Now Rosgosstrakh, Denis Simachv Shop &amp; Bar, Radisson Royal Hotel, Shashlychnaya No. 1 and several other Russian companies have their own representative offices in Foursquare, which offer bonuses and discounts to users of the social network.  And now the first really big ‚Äúplayer‚Äù has joined them - the MTS company.  According to available information, in the near future, within the framework of cooperation with 4sq, the company plans to launch a number of shares aimed at promoting the geosocial network in our country. <br><br>  The red and white telecom operator has its own <a href="http://foursquare.com/redenergymts">Red Energy</a> channel, which previously announced a discount on the MTS 916 Android communicator, to everyone who will make a ‚Äúcheck-in‚Äù in the MTS salon.  All stores in Moscow and St. Petersburg already have their addresses in foursquare, and if a special offer appears in the nearest to the user's location of foursquare, he will know about him first.  In the coming days, the company will announce on the same channel the opportunity to get a valuable prize by making a ‚Äúcheck-in‚Äù at the designated place.  It's nice that being an MTS subscriber is absolutely not necessary for this.  The prize will go to the one who will be in the right place first, will be marked in foursquare, will find the promoter of the company, and will show him the mark. <br><br>  The first stage of the action will be held in Moscow, under which 10 valuable prizes will be awarded.  But one can hope that in the near future, the residents of other cities of our immense one will be able to get a prize for ‚Äúcheck-in‚Äù  Information about ongoing promotions will appear on the company's channel in Foursquare.  The list of special offers promises to constantly expand, and the most active users of foursquare will be awarded additionally. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/114398/">https://habr.com/ru/post/114398/</a></p>
