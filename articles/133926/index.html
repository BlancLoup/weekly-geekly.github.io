It seems to be, why even make out such a confused thing?  But the fact is that with the proper approach, a badge can turn from useless pieces of paper on a participant's neck into a bridge between two worlds: the real and the virtual. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      To begin with, let's think about what functions the badge performs now.  I see two main ones.  The first of them is for the needs of the guard, in order to weed out strangers and take them out of the hall (therefore, the badge is asked to be worn in a visible place).  The second is for participants to understand with whom you are talking on the sidelines. <br><br>  If the badge still copes with the first function back and forth, then it copes with the second one is lousy.  Firstly, the name on it is so small that you have to peer in order to read with whom you speak.  Secondly, he dangles somewhere on the belly, and when you stand with a person face to face you have to bend your head in order to read the information. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/c4e91183/68fb3063/5c14f1d6/ebea940a.gif"><br><br>  Therefore, the first thing to do is to move the badge from the belly to the chest.  But you can not use pins or clothespins for this - they spoil the clothes.  One solution would be to print a badge on self-adhesive paper, on which, for example, stickers are printed at airports for passengers in transit.  This will make it easy to glue the badge to any fabric and also to easily unhook it after the conference. <br><br>  Next, fill the badge with additional functions.  One of the problems at IT conferences is that most people know by their nicknames and avatars, and not by their first and last names.  Therefore, meeting with a person in person, it does not work out.  To overcome this problem, you need to print an avatar and a nickname in addition to the name on the badge.  In the case of Habr conferences, you can also print the topic of the last most famous post.  :) <br><br>  The next question that is always interesting is the profession of a person.  In particular, it would be useful to make it easier to find the right person (for example, a designer or technologist).  Just writing a specialization text is not enough, the text needs to be read and finding the right person in the crowd will not be easy.  Therefore, you can resort to color display.  For example: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/54b1ab69/7146541f/4778fc05/2c7a5c72.png"><br><br>  In addition to the fact that such a strip will be useful to participants who are looking for someone, it will also be useful to the organizers, as it encourages to fill out a profile in more detail during registration. <br><br>  And in order to make it easier to exchange business cards and to give a greater spirit of workability, you can also place a QR code on the badge with a link to a Facebook profile or another social network (yeah: ‚ÄúEverything's better with QR-code‚Äù). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/f92e1a86/e14e713f/93faabb6/546788a5.jpg"><br><br>  The presence of such badges would make it easier for people to communicate, meet, break up into groups of interests. <br><br>  For those who do not want to meet anyone, on the other side of the badge you need to provide an option only for protection, without personal data. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/133926/">https://habr.com/ru/post/133926/</a></p>
