      Startup Tweatfor, which has placed its project to attract funding <b><a href="https://vcstart.com/%3Fref%3Dhabr0014">on our</a></b> crowd-investing <b><a href="https://vcstart.com/%3Fref%3Dhabr0014">platform VCStart</a></b> , has found such an idea, in the opinion of its author.  And let it be, for its implementation there is still a lot to do, the initiative itself is sympathetic. <br><br>  Tweatfor is a social weather monitoring service, thanks to which you can track weather changes in a specific period of time in a particular city.  The data source is the user audience, which is also the target - the service will be useful for travelers, tourists and everyone whose life is associated with frequent trips. <br><br><h4>  How it works </h4><br>  By registering on the project website directly or through social networks, the user can view weather data based on selected criteria, such as, region, city, district, date, time.  The results of the search are presented in the form of a message feed, which resembles the Twitter service tweets in appearance. Registration, along with the current location, automatically gives the user the right to add the information to the service feed, in addition to receiving the information. <br><br>  The process of adding itself takes a few seconds.  In addition to the geo-location, the user should mention the presence of precipitation (a choice from the available options), cloudiness, windiness, and other personal or visual impressions of the weather.  The temperature is taken either automatically or specified by the user on the basis of data obtained from other sources, a thermometer outside the window or according to his own feelings.  Since the temperature is not easy to determine by feeling with a high degree of accuracy, the user is initially prompted to substitute the default temperature when adding a new weather condition.  The data is taken from popular meteorological services based on your current location, after which an average value is inserted in the corresponding service field.  However, if you are sure that your feelings are more true, you can use the substitution of values ‚Äã‚Äãor enter data manually.  You can add to this your comment, the format of which is similar to the length of the message on Twitter (143 characters), after which your information appears in the stream, where it becomes available for searching and filtering and sharing on social networks. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/59G-ApAwfkk%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiwbptWvMweMDFsA4Y3cbZszDQ2Cw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Of course, social services of this kind can not do without protection from spam.  In Tweatfor, it consists of several filters, including an obscene filter, a link filter, and a restriction on the temperature entered.  It is worth noting that Tweatfor is not a weather forecasting service, it only monitors its state.  However, forecasting as an experiment is also provided here.  Data from user messages are analyzed, and based on them, a forecast for a day, week, or month is generated for a specific location. <br><br><h4>  Possible ways to monetize Tweatfor </h4><br>  The main and most realistic model is the paid SMS information function.  Data is collected by collecting weather conditions for a specific location.  When a critical mass is collected from the same location from the location, an SMS with a pre-prepared template is sent to the subscriber database with the indication of this geolocation (for example, ‚ÄúIt's raining in Moscow, do not forget to get an umbrella‚Äù).  The second method is symbolically paid access to the weather report tape under the condition of high attendance.  The flip side of the coin is the motivation to get free access for those who have made more than 50 weather reports in their region.  In addition, the proposed sale of traffic and advertising space for resources of similar subjects and a paid app for iOS and Android. <br><br>  The last probable, according to the author of the project, ways, the truth is still in doubt.  At the launch stage, the effective sale of advertising space is far away, and a mobile application, on the contrary, would make sense to use it as a crowdsourcing tool for data collection and expansion of the user network, which provides for a free distribution model. <br><br><h4>  Perspectives </h4><br>  The project's creator, a young IT entrepreneur from Nizhny Tagil, Alexander Anischenko, believes that his weather monitoring service may become part of the regional information services.  Such services use in their basis a network of informants who provide data for customers about actual information on key requests - weather conditions, queues at gas stations, traffic information, queues at stores, etc. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1e0/234/829/1e02348297644a53bf6c9b78dfb22d68.jpg"><blockquote>  <i>Alexander, how did the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating Tweatfor come?</i> <br><br>  <i><b>‚ÄúOnce I was sitting at a laptop and suddenly it started to rain.</b></i>  <i><b>At the same time, nothing was said about the weather forecast, and I thought that it would be cool to know about such abrupt changes in the weather.</b></i>  <i><b>As a result, the idea was implemented in the demo version of the Tweatfor service, which implements the main functions. ‚Äù</b></i> <br><br>  <i>What is the current stage of the project?</i> <br><br>  <i><b>‚ÄúFor the end user and the investor, there is a ready demo version, a video overview of working with it, and a description of the main functionality, there is a website for the‚Äú clean ‚Äùversion of the service.</b></i>  <i><b>A team is currently being formed.</b></i>  <i><b>Since this is my first project, I encounter difficulties, and a lack of understanding of some issues, and so on. But everything is solved, and I am sure that soon Tweatfor will become a full-fledged service. ‚Äù</b></i> <br><br>  We also hope so and present you this startup as a possible investment object among dozens of other projects hosted on <a href="https://vcstart.com/%3Fref%3Dhabr0014">our platform</a> .  <a href="https://vcstart.com/project/servis-monitoringa-pogody-tweatfor/%3Fref%3Dhabr0014">You can</a> buy a share in Tweatfor <a href="https://vcstart.com/project/servis-monitoringa-pogody-tweatfor/%3Fref%3Dhabr0014">here</a> . </blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/235303/">https://habr.com/ru/post/235303/</a></p>
