In the near future, a number of publications will be released, where the new HPE strategy in terms of software solutions will be discussed.  We present to your attention an introductory article. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/384/89c/1c9/38489c1c96044a829d6c3fb7201ffcbf.jpg"></div><a name="habracut"></a><br>  According to industry experts, 2016 will be the ‚Äúyear of digital transformations‚Äù.  Obviously, the delay is fraught with many negative consequences, among which are the untimely response of the business to the market requirements, as well as the problems associated with the need to retain customers and maintain their loyalty.  To achieve significant success, it is necessary to accelerate the integration of technology and new ideas in the framework of digital transformation.  At the same time, managers of enterprises often regard transformation projects as ‚Äúdigital roulette‚Äù, considering them to be extremely risky, and the result - unpredictable. <br><br>  Indeed, the success of digital projects is hindered by their complexity: in addition to technological problems, organizational problems arise, including a conflict of interests.  Only one of the four companies that have embarked on the path of digital transformation is truly confident in the decisions taken, and two companies out of three openly admit that such projects implemented by them are rather an adventure.

      The reason for doubt is clear: the cost of the error is extremely high.  This fact predetermines the growing demand for consulting services.  According <a href="http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp%3FcontainerId%3DprUS40978116">to</a> IDC <a href="http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp%3FcontainerId%3DprUS40978116">estimates</a> , by 2019 the digital transformation market will reach $ 2 billion. <br><br>  Digital transformation, as defined by IDC, should include innovative reforms in at least one of the following areas: in approaches to managing an organization (for example, working with personnel) in cooperation with customers, operating model, information management.  The largest investment in transformation ‚Äî almost half of the planned volume ‚Äî will be associated with supporting changes in operational models.  They contribute to the achievement of high business performance, providing connectivity to the digital environment of products and services, assets, people and trading partners.  The information generated at the same time not only improves the quality of the decisions made, but is itself monetized. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#00b882">Everyone will have to change</font> </h2><br>  The economy is undergoing constant changes, and in fact we are dealing with a new style of doing business, a new reality.  In these conditions, IT turns out to be the main engine, allowing enterprises to change and work using advanced approaches.  You can give a lot of examples. <br><br>  See how the telecommunications industry has changed with the advent of Viber, WhatsApp, and other communication and content services.  The market turned out to be redrawn: the main stream of profits moved from voice services to data transfer.  No less radical changes have occurred in the taxi business with the advent of Yandex.Taxi, Uber, Gett services: prices have fallen, and the processes themselves have undergone transformations.  We had to restructure the hotel and tourism industries: with the advent of aggregators, the behavioral model of both service providers and their customers changed. <br><br>  These vivid examples speak of revolutionary changes that will continue, and this process affects a variety of areas.  All of us will have to change. <br><br>  It can be argued that corporate business is much more stable, but this is not quite so.  Most client companies most often receive major revenues in a particular segment of the consumer market, and users very quickly respond to the emergence of new technologies.  And although large organizations are not so agile a priori, they also have to change, since everything is interconnected in the current digital whirlpool. <br><br>  Corporate examples are very simple and illustrative: it is often easier and more profitable for a business unit of a bank to purchase IT services from a third-party company, from the cloud, than to entrust the development to full-time employees.  And it happens more often.  The reason is simple: the IT department will probably answer any initiative of the business unit: ‚ÄúWe have to wait, it will take a long time to complete this task.‚Äù  But business is ready to wait less and less. <br><br>  Indeed, the capabilities of IT departments - monopolists in the provision of IT services for their companies - are significantly limited, especially in the speed of providing new services.  That is why the clouds began to be perceived by users as an attractive alternative to traditional services.  Business customers "vote with a ruble," and money goes directly to cloud providers, often bypassing IT budgets. <br><br>  This is a simple example of what Gartner analysts call ‚Äúbimodal IT‚Äù that exists in two ways: the centralized part that exists in each company and the flexible part that comes from outside. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#00b882">Four Transformation Problems</font> </h2><br>  The first problem of digital transformation of a modern company is to change its IT infrastructure.  This is a reality that will have to be taken: very soon all large enterprises will ‚Äúlive‚Äù, if not completely in the cloud, then in the hybrid infrastructure, receiving some services within their organization, and some from the outside.  And the problem is that the quality, safety and integrity of the services purchased from different sources is different. <br><br>  All services consumed by the company must be equally safe, integrated, controlled.  Ideally, the IT department performs the role of a service broker in such a hybrid infrastructure, controlling all external services, integrating them internally.  Its task is to optimally distribute the load between the physical infrastructure, private and public clouds, providing business units with services with a predetermined quality that meets corporate standards.  At the same time, quality means not only reliability and fault tolerance, but also security, as well as a host of other requirements, up to the standard appearance, when each application for users looks like all other information systems, and not something alien. <br><br>  The second problem is the protection of digital assets.  This is an understandable and increasingly urgent task: the number of assets becomes larger, and their value and complexity increase.  Moreover, hybrid infrastructure also implies distribution - assets can be located outside the organization‚Äôs perimeter. <br><br>  We should not forget that the armament of modern criminals has grown greatly.  If before the weight categories were different - hackers could not afford to use the capacity of the corporate level, now the botnet, comparable in power to corporate resources, costs a penny.  It became harder to defend, and this issue has to be given great attention. <br><br>  The third problem is the effective use of information available to companies.  Data is becoming the main currency of the digital economy, and the key issue is their monetization.  The implementation of the data-driven enterprise management concept has become an integral part of the digital transformation, and interest to the Big Data projects for many organizations has long been transferred from the theoretical to the practical plane. <br><br>  Separately, it should be said about the role in the digital transformation of employees.  New business processes will require a fundamentally different corporate culture.  Digitalization implies full transparency of the processes, which places new demands on the interaction and use of information in current work. <br><br>  Thus, the staff is again in the spotlight.  As Accenture analysts emphasize in the <a href="https://www.accenture.com/ru-ru/company-news-release-techvision-2016">Technology Vision 2016</a> study, very often companies that adopt technology formally are exhausted by the ‚Äúdigital race‚Äù.  They are experiencing a certain cultural shock from the realization that they cannot be left behind in any way.  Those who rely on people are given the opportunity to create new business models that allow them to change the rules of the digital game in their favor. <br><br>  The competitive advantage of quickly adapting staff is obvious to everyone.  For successful work in the digital environment, its characteristics are required, such as the presence of deep expertise in specialized areas, fast learning and the ability to quickly switch between different tasks. <br><br>  It is important to ensure the productivity of users.  The employee should be able to use the same functionality both in the workplace and in any other location.  We must strive to build business processes, information systems and access to them in such a way that the high efficiency of his work is maintained even during remote work. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#00b882">Walk the path together</font> </h2><br>  Anyway, any modern company will have to face the challenges of digital transformation.  However, they are all interrelated.  The desire to resolve issues in a comprehensive manner makes it relevant to use external services: all problems can be closed, both in terms of receiving consulting services and in terms of access to software products. <br><br>  Understanding the need for change is growing, and individual industries are actively seeking to provide this kind of services.  For example, many of the largest Russian banks are already showing considerable interest in them.  However, it should be understood that the success of transformation is primarily determined by the company's willingness to change, not just the desire to try something new and the availability of appropriate opportunities from external suppliers.  When we offer our help, we are talking primarily about interaction.  We have the knowledge and experience, but companies, as a rule, already have plans to develop their own business, so each transformational project is unique.  We can go this way with you, and we are confident that it will be completed successfully. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#00b882">Transformation as a strategy</font> </h2><br>  Hewlett Packard Enterprise's corporate strategy defines four key areas of digital transformation, namely: transformation into a hybrid infrastructure (Transform to a hybrid infrastructure), protection of digital assets (Protect your digital enterprise), solutions based on enterprise data (Empower the data-driven organization) and productivity (Enable workplace productivity). <br><br>  Transformation into a hybrid infrastructure means the provision of transparency, manageability and service management.  HP has always specialized in developing solutions for managing IT and services and in this discipline feels like an old-timer, quite comfortable.  Now there is a systematic development of these technologies, with which the HP software portfolio began to form.  It is appropriate to apply to them the term "ERP for IT".  If the IT department is presented as an organization, then the HPE portfolio contains a complete set of technologies for managing all its components - from infrastructure to finance and interaction with vendors.  HPE solutions are distinguished by the fact that they are equally well able to manage both physical and virtual infrastructure, and with a hybrid infrastructure, this capability is extremely necessary. <br><br>  As for the protection of digital assets, we are talking about the portfolio of Enterprise Security Products and, first of all, the creation of IT security management centers (SOC), as well as software testing for vulnerabilities from the earliest stages of development, when the application code is analyzed, and during deployments ‚Äî when checking the resilience of a complete application or portal to all currently known vulnerabilities.  In addition, the HPE portfolio has a range of solutions to ensure business continuity, improve data availability, back up and restore data if necessary. <br><br>  To provide support for the direction of solutions based on enterprise data, a platform for processing the HPE Big Data Platform Big Data was created, which provides many customers with the opportunity to build effective analytical systems to work with both structured information and unstructured information ‚Äî with data from social networks, voice recordings or video. <br><br>  Speaking of productivity, we primarily mean managing mobile applications and ensuring their quality - resiliency, load resistance and functional compliance with expectations.  Often this becomes critical to achieving success across the company, especially if mobile applications are one of the means of attracting additional customers.  Separately, you should pay attention to the security of mobile applications: they process huge amounts of personal user data and financial information, which leads to a rapid increase in the number of customers interested in security issues. <br>  In subsequent articles, we will discuss in more detail about each of the mentioned areas of transformation and the means that can be used to support this process. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299354/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299354/</a></p>
