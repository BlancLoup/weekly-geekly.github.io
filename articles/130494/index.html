  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How I tested samsung galaxy s 2</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/593d1d39/a0a45f13/97334bff/9f3bac40.jpg">  In this article I will talk about my subjective feelings from samsung galaxy s 2 and how I could get it for testing from samsung. <br><br>  A little background, in this life I had 4 phones on the android htc hero, htc desire, zte blade and samsung galaxy tab 7, there were also all iphone except 4s.  When I thought about transferring myself to the cloud and moving from a regular mobile to smart (I don‚Äôt even know how to call it another way), and the choice was between android and iphone, before that I switched completely to google services and the choice fell on android, and apple There is still not enough full support for working with google services (although gmail for ios came out this week). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Once in the icy winter time, I wanted a new tablet galaxy tab 10.1 and wrote <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/samsung/questions/46/">questions to the company samsung</a> on Habr√©.  I received a positive response and the time went, after three months of negotiations at the end of September, I received a long-awaited galaxy s 2 instead of a tablet (but at that time I was already captured by ipad 2). <br><br>  The first impression of the phone is its rather cheap appearance, it is completely made of plastic and, in addition to the cheap look, won a lot in weight (the lightest device I kept), and its average price on the market is 22,500 rubles, I think the Samsung company should release one flagship that would have looked more impressive.  The back cover is very thin and if you shortly cut your nails you can‚Äôt take it off.  Under it are hidden slots for SD cards, SIM cards and batteries for 1650 mah.  The battery lasts about 8 hours of active use of the phone and this is the main disadvantage of the phone compared to the iphone.

      The screen is the same size as the htc hd2, but because of the thinner case, my thumb reaches to any point on the screen.  The off button is located on the top right and it is convenient to press it with your thumb, the most successful solution compared to the top buttons on iPhone 4, htc desire and buttons in a row at htc hd 2. In the figure I drew a schematic layout of the buttons of these devices. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/62517604/318fe315/92453240/35054ded.png"><br><br>  I was also pleased with the sensor of the attachment of the phone to my ear, I don‚Äôt know what it is called according to science, but here it‚Äôs done well and I didn‚Äôt throw a single phone call with my cheek, which I can‚Äôt say about other phones (maybe the situation with iphone 4 is also good, but I used it very little). <br><br>  I was very pleased with the speed of the phone, this is the only device where Skype does not slow me down during intensive chats (and Skype manages to slow down and fall even on ipad 2).  Everything opens very quickly, the Internet is flying, toys are playing.  The only thing I will note is that there is still a sticking google reader, but then the developers of the good company are apparently to blame. <br><br>  It also pleases that in the new android there is an opportunity to share 3g internet via wi-fi with just five clicks of a finger.  If someone knows a widget that by one click fumbles 3g internet write in the comments, I unsuccessfully searched for it in the market (quick wifi not to offer, one click would be desirable). <br><br>  The 8 megapixel camera shoots well only in good lighting, shoots slower than the camera on the iphone 4, so there is much to do with Samsung.  Two photos from the phone: the first lop-eye, the second master class on creative from red keds. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/2f8622b9/678197af/a4b49d13/d562a44d.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/5785259b/d5f66d1e/cc6156a4/d8d08f7d.jpg"><br><br>  Touch buttons become the scourge of all devices, I honestly hate them, and the only thing that at least somehow forgives this device is that it has one of the three buttons not touch.  I think the device, which will be at the same level as this one, but without the touch buttons, will be very popular. <br><br>  The screen looks great, on auto-adjusting it looks great in the dark and in the sun, the resolution is enough for viewing pages on the Internet and for video. <br><br>  From what I didn‚Äôt talk about and what I didn‚Äôt manage to use: the radio (I usually listen, but then my headphones are lost somewhere), mini-hdmi (I just have no place to stick it), technical characteristics (processor frequency, etc., to me as a user not at all interesting). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/130494/">https://habr.com/ru/post/130494/</a></p>
