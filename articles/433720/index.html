With more than a dozen certified hardware providers and cloud service providers, choosing the right partner can be very difficult. <br><br>  We decided to collect the top 10 reasons why you should choose a solution for SAP HANA from the company Hewlett Packard Enterprise and divided our article into two parts.

      If you want to learn how not to lower the budget for IT infrastructure into a black hole, choosing a solution under SAP HANA - welcome under cat. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rt/yi/br/rtyibrswzu7hx_dphvelkdjvnwo.jpeg"></div><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <s>Unfortunately,</s> fortunately, in this article we will not touch upon the aspects of sizing solutions for SAP HANA, but we are always ready to help during the discussion to tell more about sizing and help choose the best platform option. <br><br>  The most important thing is that you don‚Äôt need to think that systems for HANA are large servers that occupy a whole cabinet.  We already live in the world when we say ‚ÄúSAP HANA‚Äù, and we understand both a regular virtual machine on a two-socket server and huge cubes in memory of several hundred terabytes - it all depends on your appetite! <br><br><h2>  <font color="#00b882">1. Total number of deployed systems under SAP HANA (as per Gartner report)</font> </h2><br>  On clothes meet!  Therefore, for many customers, when they choose a rather expensive solution, it is important to understand what vendor‚Äôs track record is.  Well, the HPE's track record in designing, implementing, and supporting SAP HANA solutions is a matter of genuine interest, and this is clearly reflected in the latest Gartner report for 2018: ‚Äú <a href="https://www.gartner.com/doc/reprints%3Fid%3D1-4Q1FS9L%26ct%3D180131%26jsp%3D%26ActivityID%3DNA%26AssetID%3DNA">What is the</a> need to know about <a href="https://www.gartner.com/doc/reprints%3Fid%3D1-4Q1FS9L%26ct%3D180131%26jsp%3D%26ActivityID%3DNA%26AssetID%3DNA">SAP HANA Server Vendor</a> ?‚Äù when you select a server platform provider for SAP HANA).  This study demonstrates HPE's high rankings in several categories at once.  Solutions from HPE, according to the report, are popular, as for those customers who follow the proven path to SAP HANA, using certified solutions (appliance), as well as for those who prefer to collect everything from the designer (TDI).  HPE and SAP have had close partnerships for more than 30 years, during which time we have gained invaluable experience, which we pass on to our customers.  The report snapshot is sure that the report itself will also be interesting to read: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/st/i2/of/sti2ofildipsmbtbdkwp4zwdiuw.png"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Fig.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">1 Deployed systems under SAP HANA in the world, a breakdown by vendor</font></i> <br><br><h2>  <font color="#00b882">2. The most scalable solution on modern Intel Skylake processors</font> </h2><br>  Today, HPE is a supplier of the most scalable and powerful SAP-certified HANA solutions using the latest Intel Skylake architecture processors.  The HPE Superdome Flex Server offers a unique modular design that allows you to easily and flexibly scale from 4 to 32 sockets and 48 TB of RAM.  About the architecture and how it is arranged "under the hood" we <a href="https://habr.com/company/hpe/blog/415463/">wrote</a> , I recommend.  Based on this platform, the widest range of configurations is certified for both architectures - ScaleUp and ScaleOut, up to 24 18 TB processors, and for both SoH / S4H and BWoH / BW4H.  And this is not the limit. Together with SAP, we are ready to support those users who need large volumes of configurations under SAP HANA.  Pss!  If you need a smaller server, we will have such configurations in our portfolio :) <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0b/qr/hn/0bqrhnb8azlwrq2sb_5ngmheqws.jpeg"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Fig.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">2 Scaling HPE server solutions under SAP HANA based on Intel Skylake</font></i> <br><br>  For a complete list of certified for SAP HANA configurations, do not forget to check on the Certified and Supported SAP HANA Hardware portal at the <a href="https://www.sap.com/dmc/exp/2014-09-02-hana-hardware/enEN/index.html">link</a> . <br><br><h2>  <font color="#00b882">3. The most resilient business-critical x86 platform with advanced RAS properties</font> </h2><br>  When we come to a car dealership - it is always interesting for us to sit in the coolest car, to feel this attention to detail, ergonomics and appearance.  We will not deviate from the rules and tell you about the important and useful features of our flagship. <br><br>  The HPE Superdome Flex adds additional benefits to our x86 solution by providing unique resiliency properties (RAS).  Ensuring high availability has always been a conceptual philosophy when developing HPE Superdome servers.  Functions such as the adaptive memory error correction mechanism Adaptive double device data correction (ADDDC), the HPE Superdome Flex Grid system switching matrix with adaptive routing, the Intelligent Error Analysis Engine, the microcode correction technology, the HPE Firmware First just a few of the unique features built into Superdome Flex, which sometimes are unique to x86 platforms, and which make this server the most reliable server for implementing SAP HANA. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xc/es/wm/xceswm1qoqlaiux_6mncaguzc5w.png"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Fig.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">3 bugs?</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">No, you can forget about them with HPE Gen10 servers.</font></i> <br><br>  HPE Fast Fault Tolerance is a unique technology for all HPE Gen10 systems, including Superdome Flex: continuous analysis of the state of memory chips and, in case of a risk to data, the allocation of ‚Äúspare‚Äù memory areas on the same channel.  The uniqueness of the technology lies, among other things, in the fact that integrity control does not incur significant overhead (up to 1% performance drop) and prevents the system from crashing if uncorrectable errors are detected. <br><br>  Did you know that any HPE Gen10 server also has a built-in mechanism for checking firmware for the presence of malicious code even before this firmware is delivered to the server? <br><br>  Learn more about HPE server security mechanisms: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IndTm4xrLdQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><h2>  <font color="#00b882">4. HPE solutions are based on open standards and Intel x86 processors.</font> </h2><br>  HPE solutions are part of a large and growing ecosystem based on open industry standard solutions based on Intel architecture.  Intel processors and the SAP HANA platform evolved together ‚Äî Intel was and remains the original reference architecture for the SAP HANA platform.  This collaboration is still strong today, which makes Intel the most widely used processor for SAP HANA, with a big advantage over other architectures (over 95%).  The most important thing is that Intel systems have a clear roadmap for the next generation of processors, indicating benefits for SAP HANA transaction systems, for example, support for nonvolatile Persistent Memory in the next generation of Intel Cascade Lake processors: <a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/news/intel-shows-59-percent-performance-improvement-upcoming-intel-xeon-processor-scalable-family/">announcement by Intel</a> . <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/5f/hn/y5/5fhny5ulaocjlwc7sayxvaswu4u.jpeg"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Fig.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">4 Intel processors roadmap for SAP HANA</font></i> <br><br><h2>  <font color="#00b882">5.

HPE offers the widest range of solutions for HANA: from certified fully integrated solutions to individual TDI modules, using a wide range of certified or supported computing systems and storage systems, including 2-processor entry-level systems, a set of products for the composable infrastructure or our line of business-critical systems for the most demanding environments HANA.
