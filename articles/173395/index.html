Watch: Now Through 2018 (February 07, 2013).</i> <br><br>  In recent years, many technologies have appeared that significantly change the world around us.  The main changes in recent years have been: <b>banking industry</b> (under the influence of mobile devices, the Internet, virtual reality);  <b>transportation</b> (with the advent of sensory systems and smart cars);  <b>health care</b> (genome analysis currently costs less than $ 1000, which allows you to create qualitatively new drugs adapted for a particular person). <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      Cloud computing will be widely used in most enterprises.  Today, from 30% to 40% of companies keep public information in cloud systems.  In the coming years, their number will increase significantly due to ease of use and cost-effectiveness. <br><br>  Tablets will replace personal computers.  By 2016, the number of tablet computers will be 760 million (with almost one third of these devices will be used for work).  Such a number of tablet computers will change not only the mechanism of interaction with customers, but also existing business processes. <br><br>  <b>The list of 15 most promising technologies compiled by Forrester analysts:</b> <br><br>  <i><b>End user computing technologies</b></i> <br><br>  <b>1. New generation devices and user interfaces (Next generation devices and user interfaces).</b>  The evolution of personal devices, mobile technologies and personal computers.  The direction also includes the expansion of forms of interaction between the device and the user (recognition of voice commands, gestures, movements, location in space). <br>  <b>2. Technologies for collaboration and information sharing (Advanced collaboration and communication).</b>  A set of technologies providing the ability to work effectively anywhere in the world.  The direction includes the system of interaction between employees, working with information and documents in real time, communication systems and communications. <br>  <b>3. Systems of social interaction (Systems of engagement).</b>  Social interaction systems are built primarily for employees to optimize the accumulation, transfer, search and analysis of unstructured information.  The direction includes: social platforms and applications (to support and expand cooperation);  integration of disparate systems, which should work as a whole (supply chain management, personnel management). <br><br>  <b>Sensors and remote computing</b> <br><br>  <b>4. Smart products.</b>  The boundaries between products and services are beginning to blur.  This is not just a transition from products to services, it is about a number of new ways in which companies interact with customers through social and mobile technologies.  An example of such a product is the B2C service, which allows the client to track information on the delivery status of the goods and adjust it in accordance with certain parameters (time, quantity). <br>  <b>5. Positioning services (In-location positioning).</b>  Positioning services built on the basis of determining the current location of a user's mobile device can be used not only for solving navigation tasks and entertainment, but also directly in the company's business processes. <br>  <b>6. Machine interaction (Machine to machine networks (2)).</b>  The common name for a set of technologies that allow machines to exchange information with each other, or transmit it unilaterally.  These can be wired and wireless monitoring systems for sensors or any device parameters (temperature, inventory, location, etc.). <br><br>  <i><b>Process data management</b></i> <br><br>  <b>7. Applications supporting intelligent processes (Smart process applications).</b>  A new category of applications designed to support processes that are heavily used by people are poorly structured and subject to frequent changes.  It should be noted that the direction of Smart process applications can be viewed as a development of Business Process Management Suite (BPMS).  According to analysts, such processes exist, primarily in the financial sector (for example, the issuance of loans, claim work). <br>  <b>8. Advanced analytics.</b>  Advanced analytics can be viewed as a set of analytical methods used to predict customer behavior in real time.  Modern methodologies allow: to predict competitive initiatives;  identify hidden market demand;  predict customer behavior.  It should be noted that these analytical models are currently used in projects such as IBM's Watson and Blue Brain. <br>  <b>9. Ubiquitous use of business analytics (Pervasive BI).</b>  Business intelligence technologies are not just a collection of standard reports.  The main goal is to provide real-time data processing and minimize the delay between analysis results and specific actions. <br>  <b>10. Cloud services and processes (Process and data cloud services).</b>  New technologies allow companies to organize new interaction mechanisms.  Software as a service (Software as a Service) and processes as a service (Process as a Service) are a prime example of such technologies.  They can significantly reduce entry barriers in some industries, greatly simplifying the emergence of new players. <br><br>  <i><b>Infrastructure and application platforms (Infrastructure and application platforms).</b></i> <br><br>  <b>11. Platforms for working with big data (Big data platforms).</b>  Big data platforms are a set of infrastructure tools for processing extreme amounts of data in various formats at high speeds.  They provide more efficient possibilities for collecting, processing, analyzing these data in comparison with traditional technologies. <br>  <b>12. Breakthrough storage and compute technologies (Breakthrough storage and compute).</b>  The new generation of high-performance servers and data storage facilities allows enterprises to move to a new level of information processing. <br>  <b>13. Software defined network (Software defined infrastructure).</b>  New data networks, in which the level of network management is separated from the data transmission devices and is implemented by software.  This approach is currently regarded as one of the forms of computing resources virtualization. <br>  <b>14. Platform for cloud applications (Cloud applications frameworks).</b>  A set of cloud technologies that deploy and operate applications in a cloud environment.  By 2018, private clouds may disappear, as their support may not be economically viable.  Corporate applications of large enterprises will be placed in hybrid clouds or on the infrastructure of service providers. <br>  <b>15. New methods of identification and protection (New identity and trust models).</b>  Modern identification methods include several new standards that provide a high level of reliability when authenticating devices.  Modern systems of protection against fraud should provide: identification of the device (the ability to instantly distinguish customers and employees from intruders);  protection against malware (devices of customers and employees must be constantly checked for viruses to ensure safe operation). <br><br>  <a href="http://blogs.forrester.com/brian_hopkins/13-02-07-forresters_top_15_emerging_technologies_to_watch_now_to_2018">blogs.forrester.com/brian_hopkins/13-02-07-forresters_top_15_emerging_technologies_to_watch_now_to_2018</a> <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/173395/">https://habr.com/ru/post/173395/</a></p>
