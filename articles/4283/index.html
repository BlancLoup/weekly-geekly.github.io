  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Give us a gossip! Right now!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Harvey Levin, <a href="http://tmz.com/">head of TMZ.com‚Äôs</a> yellow blog, shines like a polished penny: ‚ÄúWe kicked ass for everyone with Mel Gibson's story!‚Äù  In a telephone conversation, he told the San Francisco Chronicle journalist that his blog was the first to tell about the hottest scandal of this summer.  ‚ÄúHarvey was pretty buried in triumph in her ears,‚Äù the journalist shares her impressions. <br><br>  In late July, Mel Gibson had the imprudence to get behind the wheel drunk, and at the time of detention - to speak out sharply in an anti-Semitic vein.  Mel's speech did not like either the traffic police or the general public - he suddenly became persona non grata.  The topic was exaggerated in newspapers and on television, and in blogs it was <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/article/516/">one of the most popular</a> .  The editorial with the news about the TMZ.com scandal was updated earlier - a blog and collected some raspberries. <br><br>  Traditional journalism has only recently realized that blogs can give a fever and chop off a good part of attention.  The race for the exclusive is getting tougher, and its rules are transformed - the example of TMZ-Gibson clearly demonstrated this.  Apparently, journalists will have to quickly get in shape - especially those who are engaged in a profitable yellow business.

      Bloggers are developing their own techniques in the production and distribution of gossip.  This is almost an entire school, in which the tabloid press will certainly need to enroll, says Neva Chonin, author of the article ‚ÄúGive us a gossip!  Right now!".  At the same time, ‚Äúgossip‚Äù on blogs differs dramatically - it is dynamic, fresh, sometimes absurd, and extremely disrespectful.  The found form desperately likes modern society.  Tabloid on its background seems to have returned from the Jurassic period. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe do not have a specified update cycle, are not burdened with production and editorial processes,‚Äù says Levin.  ‚ÄúThis is our huge competitive advantage.‚Äù <br><br>  Competitors are large television corporations or branched publishing houses with offices around the world.  Well, worthy opponents of blogs, whose authors, shod in slippers, sit at their homes.  TMZ, however, does not apply to these - the resource is supported by AOL and Telepictures, and a large staff has been hired to manage it. <br><br>  ‚ÄúNo one is interested in official releases about the next round of relations between Nick and Jessica,‚Äù says Neva.  - It is much better to find out what they ate for breakfast and how they communicated from the blog of the waitress who served them in the cafe.  About the fact, for example, where they went next, tell, writing a blog, a taxi driver. " <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe are witnesses of the‚Äú democratization ‚Äùof popularity because the distance of observing celebrities has decreased, says Joshua Gamson, a professor of sociology at the University of San Francisco.  ‚ÄúI go online and say I saw Gwyneth Paltrow and she looked good.‚Äù  Information in this case will not be descending - it runs directly from person to person. ‚Äù <br><br>  ‚ÄúSociety is in the development phase when people who are not included in the hierarchical system of media institutions become popular newsmakers.  The degree of freedom has increased unprecedentedly, because everyone says exactly what he has to say. ‚Äù <br><br>  The question of whether or not what is happening with celebrities deserves separate consideration. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4283/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4283/</a></p>
