The event is almost confined to an important date for Sberbank - Sberbank of Russia was founded on November 12, 1940.  ‚ÄúSince then, we believe that we are serving this country.  We try to make people happier. ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bc7/9c2/c7e/bc79c2c7e7b74e86a5a54534aa8e81d4.JPG" width="600"><br>  <i>Mikhail Enerburg</i>

      In 2014, the Sberbank venture fund invested in eToro.  Ehrenburg spoke about the reasons for the transaction.  ‚ÄúWe, firstly, expect it to be financially efficient.  Secondly, in our mission it is written: we are always there.  eToro makes financing more intimate and understandable; this is the same thing that Sberbank does, only with the help of other technologies.  We are grateful to Yoni Assia for the work. ‚Äù <br><br>  The first question from the audience is why Sberbank invested in this project.  The main reason is to make it easy to invest in Russia.  For this reason, the largest bank in Russia invited eToro to this country.  ‚ÄúThis is an awesome job and an awesome product.  Our investment does much what Sberbank is for. ‚Äù <br><br>  Ehrenburg said that Sberbank currently does not plan to withdraw from eToro capital.  ‚ÄúFor us, this investment is a venture capital, but we do not see the horizon when we want to exit.  This is not a question of finance for us. ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/820/b24/3e0/820b243e0f144735b851dd922d16b657.JPG" width="600"><br>  <i>EToro Investors</i> <br><br>  Yoni Assia, founder and CEO of eToro, revealed a new product that the company had been working on for 18 months and spoke about the company's vision for the financial market. <br><br>  Now in the hands of professionals are 117 trillion dollars.  These professionals, who are responsible for Money Management 1.0, do not actually participate in the creation of technologies, but work in the industry through personal relationships.  Nothing has changed in this market over the past twenty years - most people still do not have the ability to manage fiances, since a lot of money is needed to enter the market.  The eToro project aims to change this situation and create Money Management 2.0, give everyone the opportunity to invest in Google or Facebook shares, buy oil or gold.  The platform is intuitive, it is not difficult to master its functionality.  You need to invest not thousands and tens of thousands of dollars - you can buy stocks for fifty dollars.  And with the help of eToro, anyone can become a professional trader, either by making deals on their own or by copying other players. <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúIf you want to change the world, change yourself,‚Äù said Mahatma Gandhi.  And we say: "Invest in the changes you want to see in this world." </blockquote>  Technology changes orders that seem old, like the world.  They exempt from middlemen.  Why is Uber successful?  It is cheaper and easier than traditional taxis.  Uber, eBay and Airbnb are changing entire businesses.  The same eToro tries to do with finances - it unites people who want to manage money, and gives them the opportunity to share their experience and knowledge for free, as happens in Wikipedia.  The main goal of each eToro user is to make a profit.  People share strategies. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/cfe/f88/ceb/cfef88ceb440cecda169bbb12cbdc7d5.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br>  <i>Yoni Assia</i> <br><blockquote>  80% of 124 million eToro traded transactions were closed at a profit. </blockquote>  Then Yoni Assia spoke about the possibilities of the eToro platform and about the translation of the site into Russian.  Users invest their own or virtual funds, copy other traders, share news and information in the tape.  There is no commission for copying.  In the search on the platform, you can select a trader to copy by country and profit, chat with him, find out details about transactions.  After selecting the amount to copy, you can assign a stop loss and take profit.  You can tell about your deals in the tape or on external sites. <br><blockquote>  The product is unique in its functionality.  For each transaction, you can choose any trading conditions from leverage to stop loss.  You do not pay any commission.  You get dividends that you receive on shares.  This is an analogue of investing directly in the largest companies.  Soon we are planning to add shares of Russian companies to the listing.  <i>Pavel Salas, head of eToro in Russia</i> </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2ca/1b7/675/2ca1b76758604523bb54278a615d6bf1.JPG" width="600"><br>  <i>Russian site</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5ba/53a/d8e/5ba53ad8ed634714a41cb435063e873c.JPG" width="600"><br>  <i>EToro performance</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296294/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296294/</a></p>
