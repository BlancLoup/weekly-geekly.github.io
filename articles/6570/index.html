Is a corporate website an e-business?  And the online store?  Try to make a search in the search engines, and you will learn a lot about e-business centers, but finding information about the e-business itself will not be so easy.  Most web developers are still limited to template solutions: a representative site, a catalog, an e-shop, etc.  But is it enough to build effective e-business solutions? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  First of all, let's take a look - at whom e-business can be sent.  Today, the classification is known, according to which the Internet solution can be focused on doing business with consumers (B2C), with employees within the company (B2E), with other companies (B2B), on transactions between companies and government organizations (B2A / B2G) and business between clients (C2C).  Theoretically, there is also a category of C2A to ensure transactions between consumers and the state.  Further, e-business can also be classified into such categories as: internal business systems, corporate communications and interaction, electronic commerce. <br><br>  E-commerce, as a rule, is represented by solutions such as an online store, logistics management systems, online marketing and others.  It can be focused both on consumers (B2C) and on other companies (B2B).  In the first case, there are three basic models: a model based on advertising, a model based on community and a model based on rewards.  Nowadays, international standards of UN / EDIFACT are actively used in e-commerce solutions, which allow ensuring the ‚Äútraceability‚Äù of goods, unification of their nomenclature, synchronization of databases, and so on. <br><br>  To ensure interaction within the company's e-business space, technologies such as voice telephony, voice mail, Email, web conferencing and content-oriented Internet solutions are used.

      Internal business systems are based on applications such as CRM (customer relationship management), ERP (enterprise resource planning), EDM (electronic document management), HRM (human resource management).  In e-business, knowledge management and e-learning systems also become traditional. <br><br>  As you can see, we can hardly talk about a full-fledged electronic business, when a company has only one or two Internet solutions that are ‚Äúcut off‚Äù from the corporate information system.  It seems that achieving a real effect, at least for large and medium-sized companies, is possible only by deploying corporate information systems based on the Web. <br><br>  Is it so?  Let's also look at the latest trends in the global web development market, baptized by Tim O'Reilly as Web 2.0.  First of all, the Internet is beginning to be viewed as a single platform.  This is something like a global operating system whose applications are websites.  It‚Äôs fundamentally that access to any applications of this comprehensive platform is carried out according to the same principles, through a web browser.  Moreover, for the users of this platform, it does not matter at all what hardware is working and where the platform's applications are geographically located. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/bba/981/9c1/bba9819c1c997ef161cc0dc0e3e1f1a6.gif" width="440" height="508" alt="Internet as a platform" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  Thus, we see that the information space of the company's e-business is also represented as a platform, which includes both e-commerce applications and interaction systems, as well as applications of internal business systems.  Those.  The user of a corporate Web-based information system should be able to work with the system's applications, regardless of where he is physically located: in a remote office, in another country, at home or even on an airplane.  Moreover, the device with which it will work if it has a web browser and the ability to access the Internet is not particularly significant.  This approach still looks like an idealistic utopia, but the widespread adoption of SOA technology (service-oriented architecture) makes the described model not only real, but also obviously standard in the near future.  There are more and more companies specializing <a href="http://www.rglab.ru/technologies/web_integration/">in web integration</a> .  They actually organize software bridges between web applications and business programs of the company's local networks and its partners.  Thus, existing applications of local information networks become Internet applications as a platform. <br><br>  E-business trends driven by Web 2.0 technologies have transformed the principles of corporate interaction so much that they got their own definition of Enterprise 2.0.  They embody the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa user community that has become dominant in the past year in e-business.  This idea is based on such provisions of Web 2.0 as the architecture of encouraging users to participate (architecture of participation) and the principle of owning their own data within an application. <br><br>  It remains to mix all the ingredients, generously fills the <a href="http://www.cmsdevelopment.com/ru/articles/ria_cms/">RIA (technology enriched Internet applications)</a> and voil√† - here it is an effective e-business, e-business of the new generation. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/6570/">https://habr.com/ru/post/6570/</a></p>
