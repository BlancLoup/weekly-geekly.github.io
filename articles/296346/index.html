Now Apple has announced the closure of the service.  Users of the service company offered to transfer their accounts to Apple Music.  Is it too high a price for expanding an audience? <br><br>  Apple will close the Beats Music service on November 30, 2015.  If users of the service do not transfer their accounts to Apple Music before this time, their subscriptions to Beats Music will simply expire.  As a consolation, representatives of the corporation noted that Apple Music actually offers even more functionality than Beats Music: in addition to the DJ playlists, it contains improved recommendation technology and broadcasting from Beats 1. <br><br>  For incredulous users, information about the closure of the service with the proposal to switch to Apple Music is duplicated right on the main page of <a href="http://www.beatsmusic.com/">the</a> Beats Music <a href="http://www.beatsmusic.com/">website</a> . <a name="habracut"></a>

      Apple introduced its music streaming service on June 8 at the <a href="http://9to5mac.com/2015/06/08/wwdc-liveblog-2015-ios9-osx-apple-music-watch/">WWDC</a> conference.  Apple Music claims leadership among similar projects.  The service offers options such as native integration with the iOS music app, playlists selected by various criteria, including a selection of the most popular artists. <br><br>  The user can listen to music from his own iTunes library and service catalog, which includes more than 30 million songs.  Apple Music is integrated with Siri voice search.  The application also includes the online radio Beats 1 with a 24-hour broadcast from New York, London and Los Angeles. <br><br>  One of the strengths of the service is the ability to communicate listeners and performers through a special portal Apple Connect.  It is integrated with Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, and also allows you to share content via email and iMessage. <br><br>  The Apple Music service was created based on the Beats Music service owned by Beats Electronics.  Beats Music transmits "the right music for the moment."  The user is invited to choose in the mobile application where he is, what he feels, and with whom he is now: ‚ÄúI am on a boat‚Äù, ‚ÄúI have a feeling that I am back in time‚Äù, ‚ÄúMy family is with me‚Äù.  Beats Music, receiving this information, includes playing the appropriate tracks, based on the user's musical preferences. <br><br>  Apparently, Apple believes that now is the time to take advantage of its "trump card" and drag the user audience from one asset to another.  The fact is that competing services are not asleep. <br><br>  In early September, the streaming service <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotify">Spotify</a> launched a new feature - Discover Weekly.  This is a special weekly playlist containing songs selected based on customer preferences. <br><br>  Google on October 27 <a href="http://recode.net/2015/10/27/google-brings-podcasting-to-play-music-swinging-at-apples-dominance/">announced the</a> support of podcasts, which after some time will appear in the music service <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Play_Music">Google Play Music</a> .  This step will significantly expand the audience of the service.  Both Apple Music and Play Music offer a music library of more than 30 million audio recordings.  But in the application from Apple managed to find some albums that are not in Play Music.  The quality of playback is slightly different: Google offers the standard MP3 format with a digitization rate of 320 kbps, and Apple - AAC 256. <br><br>  Apple Music also <a href="http://www.techtimes.com/articles/106233/20151113/youtube-music-vs-apple-music-vs-spotify-say-hello-to-the-new-king-of-music.htm">has a</a> new competitor - <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.google.android.apps.youtube.music">YouTube Music</a> .  On November 12, the popular video hosting service decided to bring one of its functions into a separate application.  YouTube Music is created for streaming music videos, has licenses for more than 30 million tracks (like Apple Music or Google Play Music) and is able to search for music by artist, album or title.  At the moment, the application is available only in the United States. <br><br>  In the search results, YouTube Music provides a wide range of related results: from live broadcasts from concerts to options for karaoke.  YouTube Music picks up music based on the interests of the user, given his likes and views, and then adds to personal stations. <br><br>  In Russia, the monthly Play Music subscription will cost 189 rubles, and Apple Music - 169 rubles.  On the service from Apple, you can arrange a "family" subscription for six participants for 269 rubles. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296346/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296346/</a></p>
