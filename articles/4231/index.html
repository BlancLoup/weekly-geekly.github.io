  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Yandex.Direct - five years</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The interface for self-placement of search advertising on keywords on Yandex <a href="">was launched</a> exactly five years ago: it happened on July 31, 2001. Direct‚Äôs ads were paid for on-show then, the fixed price was $ 20 per thousand impressions, <a href="">recalls</a> advertising technology.  There was no auction then, and all the ads were simply rotated randomly.  There was not even a geographic targeting.  But the main thing is that the management of Yandex had the right idea - the advertising turnover on the Internet will grow by small and medium-sized businesses, since this thesis has fully justified itself in the Western market. <br><br>  Keyword advertising was invented by Goto.com in 1997. This company was later renamed <a href="http://www.overture.com/">Overture</a> and sold to <a href="http://www.yahoo.com/">Yahoo</a> .  In 2000, a similar Google AdWords program opened, for which <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a> paid a large fine to the inventors.  A year later, Yandex, the largest search site in Russia, copied an automated search advertising system from its Western colleagues and began to use it successfully (there were no penalties here).  In Russia, however, all Western innovations were introduced very carefully: and the auction system did not appear immediately, and the placement of advertisements on partner sites has not yet been properly implemented and is not automated. <br><br>  Nevertheless, in five years, Yandex.Direct has grown very significantly.  Monthly traffic on the links from ads increased by more than 1,800 times, and the number of advertisers doubled annually.  In June 2006, Yandex.Direct turnover exceeded one million dollars a week.

      Every day, Yandex.Direct clients create more than 1,000 new ads with more than 10,000 keywords and place bids per click about 80,000 times. <br><br>  Over time, ‚ÄúDirect‚Äù not only grew, but also grew wiser - he began to promote advertising with a higher CTR, lowering her price to hit a particular position, the first in Runet offered free geo-targeting, he got an autobroker the best possible position at the lowest price) and autofocus (the system for automatic keyword refinement is perhaps the only function of Yandex.Direct, which does not have a Western prototype). <br><br>  Now the support and development of "Direct" is engaged in a group of ten developers (although most of them work not only on "Direct").  Calls and customer letters are answered by four support staff.  Moderation of applications for advertising is carried out by four moderators.  Sell ‚Äã‚Äã"Direct" (tariff "Carefree") two dozen account managers only in the sales departments of "Yandex" (Russian and Ukrainian), and also - a lot of advertising agencies throughout Russia.  However, the bulk of the revenue is still brought by orders placed directly through the web interface by the advertisers themselves.  These are people who came themselves, figured it out themselves, did everything themselves.  Especially for them on the birthday of "Direct" organized action.  All customers who paid for their advertising on August 1, 2006, will receive a <a href="http://help.yandex.ru/direct/%3Fid%3D951681">bonus of 20% of the payment</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4231/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4231/</a></p>
