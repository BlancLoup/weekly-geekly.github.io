  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Six questions that lead to the conclusion of the transaction</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I offer you a universal questioning scheme that will give you significant advantages in the negotiations.  This scheme can be used not only for sales, but also for any other purposes that involve receiving something from the interlocutor: consent to continue interaction, additional information, and so on ... <br><br>  <font><b>1</b></font> Question of opinion.  Ask a question about the opinion of the interlocutor on any question that does not imply a decision.  Expressing one's attitude does not obligate or disclose confidential information to anything.  While telling, a person begins to see an interested person in you and begins to trust you. <br>  So, the interlocutor expressed a certain opinion, began to see in you an understanding interlocutor and you can go directly to the topic of the meeting. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  <font><b>2</b></font> Questions about the facts.  This is a very effective tool, using which you can lead the client to the idea that we want to tell him at the very beginning of the meeting.  Of course, we, as competent sellers, will not offer to immediately buy our goods.  The chance to hear "no" in this case, strive for 100%.  We will focus the customer on the necessary facts so as to bring him to the idea that our offer is exactly what he lacked.  And the price that we request for it corresponds to the value that our customer has determined for itself. <br>  The meaning of the sale can be formulated with the phrase: help the client to approach the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe need to cooperate with you.  No need to prove anything, let him prove it to himself.  If you are doing everything right, then the next step is to ask a guiding question. <br>  <font><b>3 The</b></font> leading question we, so to speak, stimulate the mental activity of the client in the direction you need.  Start the question with the phrases ‚ÄúIf I understand correctly ...‚Äù, ‚ÄúAre you sure that ...‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhat if we assume ...‚Äù <br>  When asking questions, we need to lead the client to an idea that is central to your future presentation.  It‚Äôs best to ask informed questions.  That is, before you set them, you explain why you set them.  Try it and you will see that much is much easier and calmer.  When your interlocutor understands the meaning of what is happening, he feels safe, and safety is one of the most effective incentives.  So do not be afraid to explain the reasons for your actions.  And we turn to the next item and ask a reasonable question. <br>  <font><b>4</b></font> We ask a justified question in order to find out any details that we cannot find out from open sources.  ‚ÄúWhat is your average monthly consumption ...‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhat suppliers have you worked with (or are you working with) ...‚Äù and so on. <br>  During the conversation, we can alternate between suggestive and substantiated questions in order to get as much information as possible about what difficulties the client has, what he is dissatisfied with and bring him to the point that our proposal will remove some (and maybe all) problems from him . <br>  Now it is important to go directly to the presentation, the story of our proposal. Remember that you must first obtain the consent of the client to the presentation. <br>  <font><b>5</b></font> Question about the presentation.  When a client agrees to a request to listen to your information, he assumes obligations.  After all, the client has agreed not only to you, but also to himself, and now he simply needs to fulfill his obligation. <br>  At the time of the presentation you should show yourself as advantageous as possible.  Preparing for the presentation is a very important stage of the sale, it is necessary to prepare for it responsibly.  This is a topic for another conversation.  I'll come back to him. <br>  When you have said enough for a client to make a certain decision, it is time to ask a question about consent.  You can set different goals for a meeting, signing a contract, arranging a meeting with a decision maker and so on.  In any case, ask a decision question and wait for an answer. <br>  <font><b>6</b></font> Question of consent.  It is very important to pause.  Ask the right question and wait for the answer.  We must get the consent of the client.  Agree with what?  With a view to your presentation, naturally.  If we get agreement, then follow the usual procedure for the completion of the transaction (contracts, bills, acts and other pleasant troubles), but what to do in case of refusal?  If not, it makes sense to analyze the causes of failure.  Understand whether to continue to deal with objections or to give the client time (a month or two) to ‚Äúmature‚Äù.  This can only be clarified by asking questions. <br><br>  Crosspost from <a href="http://prodavai.blogspot.com/">my blog</a> </div>
