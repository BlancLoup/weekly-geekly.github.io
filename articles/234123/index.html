  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How does attracting money to a startup on Visistarte</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Crowdfunding differs from traditional forms of venture financing in that the start-up does not appeal to professional investors, who are incomprehensible and often alien to the audience, but to people like him - and often to future users of his product.  No elevator pitches, a simple conversation on equal terms in comfortable conditions for both parties.  Of course, in order for the conversation to take place, an appropriate platform is necessary.  At VCStart, startups can run a fundraising fundraising campaign in exchange for a stake in the project. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/601/f7d/7bf/601f7d7bf33444afb6edd5b799be9b2b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In this post we will describe how the process of collecting money for VCStart is arranged.  From the decision to sell the share directly to users to directly receiving the money, there are only four steps. <a name="habracut"></a>

      1. Determination of parameters of attracted investments <br><br>  Having decided to raise money on <a href="https://vcstart.com/%3Fref%3Dhabr0006">Visistarte</a> , a startup first of all must determine the investment parameters: the share that the project sells, and the actual target amount that it expects to gain for it - because the whole further campaign will be built on these parameters, and they will be changed no longer possible.  Therefore, at this stage it is important to correctly calculate your needs, to lay all possible expenses, including marketing, taxes, and even the commission of the project. <br><br>  We recommend how to think about the size of the attracted amount and the size of the share that you are ready to give to investors. <br><br>  The attracted amount should be enough for <br>  ‚Ä¢ implementation of the technical part of the startup; <br>  ‚Ä¢ payment of marketing, advertising and PR-activity; <br>  ‚Ä¢ payroll for you and hired staff; <br>  ‚Ä¢ payment of rent and utility bills; <br>  ‚Ä¢ payment of taxes and accounting; <br>  ‚Ä¢ payment of organizational costs for the creation of a legal entity and raising funds; <br>  ‚Ä¢ and many many others. <br><br>  The size of the share to be withdrawn to investors can be any, but we recommend to obey the internal toad and keep in the range of 10-25%.  This will allow you to remain motivated even after subsequent rounds of investment. <br><br>  At the same time, according to the rules of the project, at least 3% of the target amount should be reserved for redemption in startbucks.  For example, a startup collects $ 100,000 and sets a share in startbaks at a rate of 5% - in this case, investors will be able to buy a share equivalent to $ 5,000 for startbaks, and the remaining $ 95,000 are collected in cash. <br><br>  What are startbucks and why is it necessary <br><br>  In order to support investors, we have released Starbucks - a virtual currency that gives a real share in the project, but at the same time is cheaper.  The startbucks rate is equal to the dollar and gives the corresponding share in the project.  A startbax costs half of a real dollar, and gives you the right to claim a share equal to one dollar.  For the investor - that is, for any person - this is a lightweight entry into the business, allowing you to buy a share, conditionally, at $ 1,000 for $ 500 or less. <br><br>  You can also get a gift for certain services to the project: <br>  ‚Ä¢ 5 Starbucks for inviting an investor by referral. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Real investment gives +50 startbaksov <br>  ‚Ä¢ Contests and project promotions <br><br>  At the same time, the main currency of the project remains real US dollars.  Money entered into the system can be withdrawn without any commissions from the project.  In contrast, startbacks are not transferred back to money.  It is possible, for example, to sell a share bought in startbaks for real money. <br>  For investors, this is a pleasant opportunity to buy a share with a substantial discount for start packs.  For a startup, the first investors interested in the success of the project, and a quick start, because having $ 3,000 collected, even if startups, is in the account at the beginning of the collection is better than not having anything.  More can be offered - to stimulate the formation of a loyal community. <br><br>  This is an important point - from the experience of a kickstarter and other similar projects, the sooner users deposit the first sums in favor of the project, the more chances for successful collection of the entire amount - this is a purely psychological aspect.  Therefore, by the way, some startups make a certain amount of money in favor of their project in order to stimulate the rest.  In the case of VCStart, the starbucks are cheap and, therefore, easy to enter. <br><br>  2. Collection of community <br><br>  Register on Visistarte, and launching a campaign, the startup moves into a phase of self-presentation, active PR and communication with the audience.  In order to cut off dummy projects, the project rules specify the need to form your own community.  To go directly to the collection of money, a startup needs to collect 2,000 subscribers on Visistarte.  In terms of this stage is not limited - how much time does a startup need to dial 2,000 users who are carried away by the project, and it will spend so much.  VCSTart is ready to help projects at this stage with all its resources - the ability to create video presentations, tips on communicating with the audience and even advertising on the blog in Habrahabr. <br><br>  At this stage, a startup may offer users not only to subscribe to it, but also to start buying out a share in startbaks.  And as soon as the necessary amount of likes is gathered, the stage of collecting live money starts. <br><br>  3. Attraction of financing <br><br>  Now the startup has 90 days to collect the target amount.  If it was not succeeded to collect it - the transferred money simply comes back to investors.  If the collection was successful, then it remains only to take their money. <br><br>  4. Registration of the transaction <br><br>  When the target amount is successfully collected, an investment contract is entered into with the startup according to the initially stated parameters.  Investors' interests are represented by <a href="https://vcstart.com/%3Fref%3Dhabr0006">VCStart</a> , more precisely - IPC JUMPSTART VENTURE CAPITAL CORP., Registered in St. Vincent and the Grenadines.  When concluding a contract, the procedure for transferring funds is already discussed (if a startup, for some reason, is interested in receiving finance in queues). <br><br>  Project commission is 7% of the target amount.  In a project with a budget of one million dollars and a share in startbaks set at $ 50,000. (5%), the project receives 1 000 000 - (1 000 000 * 0.07) - 50 000 = $ 880 000. taking into account all requirements of the legislation of the Russian Federation, and guarantees both the interests of investors and the rights of a startup.  From a legal point of view, we will analyze its contents in the next post. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/234123/">https://habr.com/ru/post/234123/</a></p>
