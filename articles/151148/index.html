Having never visited,  All my friends say it is a must see. <br><br>  ‚ÄúI can't wait to see this city.‚Äù  Never been here, so I look forward to a completely unique architecture and rich history.  All my friends say that this is a must see. <br><br>  <b>What would you like to see here?</b> <br><br>  - But it‚Äôs a bit different.  I‚Äôve seen historical landmarks.  The older the better. <br><br>  - I know, everyone says - the Kremlin and Red Square, but I actually would like to see some cathedrals as well.  I live in a country whose history barely spans two centuries, so I will be glad to see historical places.  The older the better. <br><br>  <b>What do you expect from a meeting with Russian developers Ruby?</b> <br><br>  - I expect a vibrant community development center.  When developers, especially ideas are in close quarters, ideas and ideas. <br><br>  - I expect to see a dynamic community, as in other big cities.  When developers, especially rubists, are side by side, ideas float in the air, followed by programs. <br><br>  <b>What project / open source are you working on?</b> <br><br>  - I'm working on making the GitHub API more awesome.  I‚Äôve been the one who was in the GitHub API team. <br><br>  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm working to make the GitHub API even better.‚Äù  I have written more Ruby API wrappers than I would like to admit, and I hope to bring a client to the GitHub API team. <br><br>  <b>What do you consider your main achievement in life or career?</b> <br><br>  - Six years ago.  It goes a little bit more at a glimpse at the SXSW, but it‚Äôs not a problem. <br><br>  - My main achievement in life is that I persuaded my wife to marry me 16 years ago.  My career is developing, I was lucky to speak at a variety of conferences, to receive an award at SXSW, but nothing beats the fact that I became part of the GitHub.com team. <br><br>  <b>What do you like to do in your free time from Ruby?</b> <br><br>  I still love APIs, but I‚Äôve developed an obsession with text mode.  I‚Äôm always on line with the command line interface.  My latest favorite is <a href="https://github.com/sferik/t">Erik Michaels-Ober's t gem</a> <br><br>  - I still love the API, but I have an unstoppable passion for the command line.  I constantly monitor the emergence of new tools.  My last favorite gem <a href="https://github.com/sferik/t">t is from Erik Michaels-Ober</a> <br><br>  <b>What would you like to achieve in your profession?</b> <br><br>  - I'd love to stay technical, keeping a balance between learning and doing my love for programming. <br><br>  - I would like to remain technical, to maintain a balance between studying, doing and sharing until I retire without losing my passion for programming. <br><br>  <b>When and why did you start programming?</b> <br><br>  - I've always loved computers.  I started with Logo in elementary school.  I was doing high school homework when I was in the sixth grade.  I started web development with HTML and JavaScript in 1996. I've been doing something web-related ever since. <br><br>  - I have always loved computers.  Started with Logo in elementary school.  When my brother was in high school, I did homework for him at BASIC.  I myself was in 6th grade then.  In 1996 I started to do web development in HTML and JavaScript.  Since then, I have been constantly doing something related to the network. <br><br>  <b>What would you like to become if you didn't become a programmer?</b> <br><br>  - I'd probably be an author, a writer of extremely bad fiction. <br><br>  - Perhaps I would become a writer.  I would write terribly bad fiction. <br><br>  <b>What book would you recommend to read to any programmer?</b> <br><br>  - ‚ÄúDon't Make Me Think‚Äù for anyone doing user interface design. <br><br>  - It's hard to make a mistake by advising Steve Krug's ‚ÄúDon't Make Me Think‚Äù to someone who designs the interface. <br><br>  <b>Russia has strong literary traditions.</b>  <b>Have you read any of the Russian writers?</b> <br><br>  ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt yet  Over the past few years <br><br>  ‚ÄúNot yet, but there are several books on my list.‚Äù  Last time, after ten years, devoted mainly to scientific and technical literature, I devote much more time to fiction. <br><br>  <b>Our sponsors</b> <br><br>  We remind that the general sponsor of our conference was the company <a href="http://undev.ru/">undev.ru</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8e4/bc8/536/8e4bc85362c29e29b879248da2aeb028.png"><br><br>  UnDev is a unique company that develops large and complex projects.
