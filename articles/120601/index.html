Part two</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  After the 11-hour flight, I was again in Moscow, and I took all the impressions and emotions of the Taiwan Computex 2011 with me.  Those who have not seen the first part of the story, you can read it <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/120410/">here</a> .  Compared to the previous time, I will not give up the general principle of the construction of the material, so look at the photos of the girls below. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/c9c19b36/a02998ec/7c512453/62def09d.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The girls from the Thermaltake booth are twenty years old, but for us they look, perhaps, only for fifteen or sixteen years.  For four days, the girls helped the organizers in the prize draws, posed for the insatiable journalists, and started the public dancing.

Its total output power was 1275 watts, and the model is called the Toughpower XT Platinum 1275W. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/d6690d87/7c68b380/38d93967/c7c54355.jpg"><br><br>  Frio Extreme is a new Thermaltake super cooler.  In structure, it is similar to its counterparts from Thermalright and Noctua.  Due to the separation of two parts of the radiator independently of each other, this already refers to the category of one of the best coolers, since this form has proved its viability and competitiveness. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/dbadd035/465e661c/340fce9d/7659c443.jpg"><br><br>  At the Tt eSPORTS stand, all gaming machines were assembled in Thermaltake Chaser MK-1 packages.  This is the latest novelty of the company, and its creators are especially proud of it because of the appearance and very high functionality. <br><br>  Looking from the outside, I can say that in Taiwan (and therefore throughout the Asian region), the gaming industry is gaining very great power.  Tt eSPORTS - one of the first to draw attention to the growing need for gaming devices and released to the market a number of gaming devices. <br><br>  I especially liked: <br><br>  - headphones Tt eSPORTS Shock <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/2ac89047/0d701e4c/940f2a5c/441f6bfa.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/4f1182a9/eaf10209/d3c9eec6/e907bca4.jpg"><br><br>  - Tt eSPORTS Azurues Mouse <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/1c8a4ce5/48737ae0/70a9725b/9451410e.jpg"><br><br>  - Tt eSPORTS MEKA keyboard <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/08ef83fd/c9082871/d3eb3a2a/0d2a6782.jpg"><br><br>  - Tt eSPORTS MEKA G Unit backlit keyboard with built-in memory <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/bd45521b/3f388f63/445fa4c6/c8b74482.jpg"><br><br>  I am not a gamer, and I can not judge their gaming capabilities, but in terms of design and color options of the device, there are no complaints about the products. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/3bcb9191/3cdc405e/2ff1532d/d29ca23c.jpg"><br><br>  But the Starcraft II world champion Alexey, known by the nickname White-Ra, told me about the functionality.  According to him, Tt eSPORTS devices are very well suited to both novice gamers and professional alike.  The convenience and correctness of the form during the game allows you to almost forget that you have a mouse and keyboard in your hands, allowing you to fully immerse yourself in the gameplay. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/93bcefc9/4b96438c/c24ba09b/854b1ee2.jpg"><br><br>  Tt eSPORTS plans for the gaming device market are very serious.  At the company's office, a special training room of its own team is allocated - Tt Apollos.  Children aged 16 to 22 years old after school or college come to workouts every day and receive a monthly salary.  I wanted to learn to play Stracraft II myself. <br><br>  From the gaming industry, I propose to return to the world of iron and run through the stand of AMD, which presents motherboards on the new top-end AMD 990FX chipset. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/fe9db3c2/6e122092/6b646f62/1fa708fd.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/5c8d7b87/2a158bd0/eb14f713/2a96ff0b.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/72d3ae1b/47441527/2d6b2fc8/7066fbac.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/4473ff63/eedf3cd4/45d11a33/da6be936.jpg"><br><br>  All the boards have got a powerful CPU power cooling system.  Probably the buldozer can be hot.  And of the innovations of the chipset, it is worth noting the built-in support for USB 3.0, and fans of NVIDIA video cards will be able to combine video cards in SLI and on AMD platforms too. <br><br>  And at the stand of G.Skill, overclocking legends were demonstrated by high megahertz people. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/d985789a/6c7c3864/768db69f/56153146.jpg"><br><br>  Star composition: Shamino, YoungPro, Fredyama, Coolaer for several days showed crazy results.  Especially, it is worth noting the result of overclocking the processor Intel Core i7-2600K to 6050 MHz.  This is the world record for overclocking Sandy Bridge.  And at a frequency of 6040 MHz, they managed to pass the Super Pi 32M test in 5 minutes 33 seconds.  It was possible to achieve high results not only because of the high frequency of the processor, but also due to the excellent overclocking of the RAM.  The G.Skill memory kit functioned at a frequency of 2400 MHz !!!  True, it was possible to achieve such frequencies only when the memory was cooled with liquid nitrogen, but for the guys it did not cause any particular difficulties. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/a2a89f27/183a7f94/ef2f9b5e/cbb5b455.jpg"><br><br>  And at the PowerColor booth, we found some interesting products.  For example, PowerColor Radeon HD6970x2: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/7e1787ea/9a05d662/5b0fb5aa/14263a19.jpg"><br><br>  With the help of a special Lucid Hydra chip, two graphic processors from the Radeon HD6970 were able to be placed on a single PCB.  Radeon HD6970x2 due to the use of this chip has some differences in the exchange of data between the GPU in comparison with the Radeon HD6990, so while it is very difficult to say about the superiority of the new product. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/39d56359/7a1b321e/a054eef2/4f8680b8.jpg"><br><br>  Another interesting product noted PowerColor, but already in the field of cooling systems.  This CO allows you to adjust the height of the fan.  According to the developers, this can be more efficient.  But again, no tests can be judged. <br><br>  Interesting ideas: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/6a4fd042/e57b4c0f/f8a923bb/3abf9c16.jpg"><br><br>  To demonstrate the capabilities of their coolers, one of the companies put them in water bottles.  During all 4 days they successfully drove water. <br><br>  Or take off: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Tx1H6YK0iWg%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgUCQDhCuvIjTFBppZYZmkc2d0fLQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  And this is how the fan looks from the inside: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/ae32fa7b/1af72643/24976220/3458bdb8.jpg"><br><br>  And a selection of girls: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/baf0bb94/747a74f6/a8bccfe6/da6ba60c.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/4737ecd3/abded067/32bc63b8/306f3f51.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/ca181869/1fca520b/ab50bab7/393fb58d.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/4cf511e4/d22a2197/53e11cb5/9628a471.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/21acd0f7/c4c11f2f/9fdb4565/65c3c60b.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/5ab0d7e3/0f0ade85/f55a6b08/1942fccb.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/120601/">https://habr.com/ru/post/120601/</a></p>
