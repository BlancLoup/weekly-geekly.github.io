  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Internship retrospective</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello!  I am Vera, and for the fourth year I have been studying student internships at JetBrains.  I have long wanted to tell Habra about this, but do not bore you with <a href="https://jetbrains.ru/students/internship/">reference information</a> !  Therefore, I will tell you about one of my first interns.  Meet Valya Kiryushkina, the developer of <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/education/">Educational Products</a> , the head of the academic practice of JetBrains and a student at the <a href="https://compscicenter.ru/">Computer Science Center</a> .  It all began with him. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/72/j-/es/72j-eswaea5bk_zqsx9lfc8n8mw.jpeg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Valya graduated from the bachelor degree in IT at Tomsk State University, where, according to her, only a very organized and independent student could get the maximum benefit from education.  After that, she moved to St. Petersburg and entered the ITMO magistracy in business informatics, which looked like an interesting addition to the development experience from a distance.  In fact, it turned out that without programming, Valya is bored.  So in her life happened Computer Science Center, about which she is now joking that she managed to make another bachelor from a two-year program. <br><br>  And once the CS center happened, the <a href="https://jetbrains.ru/students/practice/">practice</a> in JetBrains inevitably happened.  Although ‚Äúinevitably‚Äù is not the exact word: Valya won the competition for the implementation of one of the most popular projects and, as they sometimes say, ‚Äúthey do not return from there‚Äù.

      Spring 2015  Plugin integration project for <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm-edu/">PyCharm Edu</a> &amp; <a href="https://checkio.org/">CheckIO</a> .  Several dozen people were interviewing Katya Tuzova. <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúI was preparing for both interviews [the second was in <a href="https://stepik.org/">Stepik.org</a> - Note.</i>  <i>auth.], repeated Java, looked at what PyCharm Edu and CheckIO are.</i>  <i>I imagined how to make the integration of these two pieces.</i>  <i>At the interview I was terribly nervous, it seems that I mixed all the words, but apparently I managed to convey the meaning. ‚Äù</i> <i><br></i> <br>  Katya, the <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/">PyCharm</a> environment developer, was at the time leading the creation of her Educational Edition.  I remember very well how pleased she came from this interview.  For the spring semester basic things were implemented.  Then, during the summer internship, the plugin was brought to a working state, and it became possible to solve tasks from CheckIO in PyCharm Edu.  But Valia was not limited to this - as part of the project, she also managed to transfer to PyCharm Edu the presentation of test results beautifully implemented in CheckIO and the display of other people's solutions and hints.  In October 2015, the release of the <a href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/pycharm/2015/10/announcing-pycharm-edu-2-0-2-checkio-integration/">plugin</a> . <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúAt first I was scared on an internship, everyone around was so serious, they were programming, they all understand this!</i>  <i>I did not know anyone, it was a lot of new things and it was hard.</i>  <i>After all, <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IDEA</a> is a very large project, there is a code base that should get into your head.</i>  <i>You feel so small, and around - a big complex world.</i>  <i>At the spring internship there was not much time for socialization, you come a couple of times a week, hang out with other trainees, and you do not have time to fit into the team.</i>  <i>In the summer, another feeling has already appeared when you go to work, like everything you do, you listen to what others do, you tell what you do.</i>  <i>You begin to understand that you are like all these people, and you start talking to them. ‚Äù</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/af/np/lf/afnplfmajwltqznjg-s6dljgcfw.jpeg"><br><br>  After the summer internship, Valya remained in the team and for some time engaged in CheckIO support, gradually mastering other tasks: for PyCharm Edu - integration with Stepik.org, for PyCharm - Code Insight and <a href="http://jupyter.org/">Jupyter Notebook</a> support.  The last project interested Valya after a trip to the <a href="https://scipy2016.scipy.org/">SciPy</a> conference in the summer of 2016 in Austin, USA, and the implementation did not take long to wait. <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúI heard a lot about the company before the internship and was already pre-configured that it was very cool and my expectations were met.</i>  <i>It's nice when there are so many smart, enthusiastic people around who do very interesting things, some kind of parallel projects that are not related to the main work.</i>  <i>I saw very interested people, and at first I was very surprised, then inspired, then I got used to it and I just began to like it. ‚Äù</i> <br><br>  Now Valya continues to work under the leadership of Katia Tuzova, but already in the team that develops <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/education/">Educational Products</a> educational tools that allow to solve programming problems in Python, Java and Kotlin directly inside <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/products.html%3FfromMenu">JetBrains IDE</a> , and also enable teachers to create programming tasks with attached to them automatic code verification tests.  This is an actively developing project that has many ambitious plans both for the support of other programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãand for the implementation of various ideas within the framework of modern educational trends. <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúI like what I'm doing now.</i>  <i>And I always want to learn something.</i>  <i>This successfully coincides with the fact that I am doing exactly educational tools.</i>  <i>I can combine work and my new experience.</i>  <i>I would like to learn more about what approaches to learning exist in general, to look at how they fit in with what is in our tools.</i>  <i>The CS center now has a course on interfaces, where you can take your project and play in the interface designer.</i>  <i>For me, this is a look at my work from a completely different perspective.</i>  <i>When you are a programmer, you are mostly busy with some kind of ‚Äúeveryday‚Äù problems, but here you have a more general view of things: what this tool does, how to classify it.</i>  <i>I'm very interested".</i> <br><br>  JetBrains has the concept of a 20% project, when you can use part of your working time for teaching, supervising interns, developing useful non-commercial projects.  Becoming a full-fledged member of the JetBrains team, Valya decided to try her hand at guiding students, and this is what happened to her on the other side of the internship program. <br><br>  Autumn of 2017  <a href="https://jetbrains.ru/students/practice/themes/pycharm-2/">Cells in the PyCharm code editor</a> .  Several dozen applications for the project. <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúThis year I have my own intern.</i>  <i>I had, it seems, 5 interviews, before that there was a test task asking why you want to work on this project.</i>  <i>This eliminated a few dozen people who applied for my project just like that, without much motivation.</i>  <i>At the interview I had a sample code from IDEA, I had to say what he was doing, just to check how a person can read the code.</i>  <i>Still it was necessary to find an error in the code and correct it.</i>  <i>The main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe project itself was to check how you can implement block-wise code execution in PyCharm.</i>  <i>We did everything we planned.</i>  <i>We still had time to look at some cool features, about which we wanted to understand what it is, whether we should do it at all.</i>  <i>The very idea for such a project came to me after the SciPy conference.</i>  <i>Someday I will definitely take another intern! ‚Äù</i> <br><br>  At this, our program comes to an end, then - an advertising pause.  This is exactly how internships at JetBrains are.  We are trying to come up with such projects so that the trainee would end up with the feeling that he didn‚Äôt just work, but that he did something useful, and developers around the world would use it.  Any serious wording on this topic can be read in my recent interview <a href="https://jetbrains.ru/students/events/popast-v-jetbrains/">here</a> .  And the next set for summer internships will open very soon - <a href="https://jetbrains.ru/students/events/se-is-2018-start/">April 20, 2018</a> .  If you are a student programmer, here's some good advice from Vali for last: <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúDo not be lazy and get ready for an interview!</i>  <i>Read about the project, think about why you want to do exactly that.</i>  <i>Go to the presentation of projects and try to understand whether you can negotiate with one or another manager, because communication with him is very, very important.</i>  <i>Try to assess what kind of independence the leader wants from you, and whether you can work in this format yourself.</i>  <i>You can even ask directly about it at the presentation! ‚Äù</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ix/ga/5c/ixga5cj8iderxuoixf_jww8ugiq.jpeg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/353400/">https://habr.com/ru/post/353400/</a></p>
