  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Impressions of PHPCONF'07</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The conference was held at Telecom Hall MMTS-9, which provided excellent sound, almost simultaneous translation, a wide screen for presentations and occasionally working WiFi.  Dull landscapes in the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãButlerov Street, slightly diluted with impressive parabolic antennas, suspiciously covered in bushes were compensated in a spring-like cheerful design of the conference room.  The organizers traditionally equipped participants with colorful badges indicating nicks from the phpclub forums, everywhere ‚Äúunscrewed‚Äù a-la slideshow ‚ÄúPHPCONF in faces‚Äù to the fiery rhythms of ‚ÄúGorky Park‚Äù and the eternal problem of the crowded ‚ÄúWho is who?‚Äù Conferences seemed solved like never before. <a name="habracut"></a>  Perhaps it is clubbing, the atmosphere of a friendly company - PHPCONF stands out from a number of other conferences.  I was all wondering why the organizers are not launching a tangible large-scale advertising campaign before the next conference.  And they really have something to push off - they are 6th year gathering PHP specialists from all over the CIS, including the authors of PECL, PEAR and various popular projects, last year PHP founder Rasmus Lerdorf and a bright figure in PHP Core Team Andrei Zmievski took part in the conference, This year came no less the venerable guru Derick Rethans.  However, the organizers limited themselves to some activity on habrahabr.ru and modest announcements on a number of thematic sites.  No new / rich media, millions of banner impressions, AdWords, media support and viral marketing.  But now I think the organizers simply chose a crowd of extras, a circle of developers really close to the PHPClub community who knew each other in absentia.  They did everything possible to encourage participants to communicate with each other and exchange experiences. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/62c/0b1/700/62c0b170018aeff5facebddccdf78956.jpg" width="450" height="600" alt="Flipchart with Derik" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  One of the successful solutions in this direction was the organization of flipcharts with experts in coffee breaks.  A good attempt to stir up the audience were contests of anecdotes from the life of developers.  Upon my return, it even inspired a corresponding <a href="http://blog.redgraphic.ru/humor/">section in the corporate blog</a> .

Judging by the T-shirts dazzled in the hall, many wished to designate themselves as the leader of web development.  By the way, I was pleased with the mini-fair of IT-books for 150 rubles.  each <br><br><video>  http://rutube.ru/tracks/66896.html?v=bf23d463db3d38a6d1ff6ab1d68365fa &lt;/ rutube&gt; Video fragments of my performance As for the reports themselves, Pavel Schevaev told me about the prospects for the use of &lt;a href = "http: / /phpaspect.org/"&gt;phpAspect &lt;/a&gt; in PHP programming.  I myself published a lot in 2005 about aspect-oriented software development, but looking at the advantages of the approach through the eyes of &lt;a href="http://agiledev.ru/"&gt; "extremals" &lt;/a&gt; is always very informative and useful.  &lt;img src = "https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/e09/9a9/cff/e099a9cff5fa8908c4a9e87b66af4a8d.jpg" width = 450 height = 337 border = 0 alt = "Pavel Shcheev" hspace = 10 vspace = &gt; Later, through the report came the turn of Igor Sysoev.  It was enough for him to just go on stage - the audience literally burst into applause.  The author of the world's fastest web server, NGINX, kept modestly and even somehow shy.  &lt;img src = "https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/d10/c51/d73/d10c51d73d8eccfb297374794e1ded5e.jpg" width = 450 height = 337 border = 0 alt = "Igor Sysoev" hspace = 10 vspace = 10 &gt; Andrei Ivannikov managed to ‚Äúshake up‚Äù the audience, and later on many coffee breaks one could hear discussions on the topic ‚ÄúFlex vs AJAX and which of them will be more popular in the future.‚Äù  I would like to mention the speech of the editor PHPInside NW (Andrei Olishchuk).  Not that the topic ‚ÄúSurvival for freelancers‚Äù itself was particularly close to me, but its presentation ... The author really annealed, and it was easy, easy and natural for the speaker to be ‚Äúaerobatics‚Äù.  &lt;img src = "https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/d36/a13/f5b/d36a13f5b2a4b143c09eb7df1871c50b.jpg" width = 450 height = 337 border = 0 alt = "Andrey Olishchuk" hspace = 10 vspace = 10 &gt; Of course, you can not ignore the report of Derik Retans (Derick Rethans).  It seems that, following the master, it is as if you are watching the work of the smallest mechanisms in a huge device.  This is PHP from the inside.  &lt;video&gt; http://rutube.ru/tracks/66996.html?v=c71eaf1abf7fe25ee9b027b6650046bd &lt;/ rutube&gt; Video fragment of the performance of Derik Retansa By the way, then Drew Robbins spoke from Microsoft (yes it is).  I can‚Äôt say that I‚Äôm excited about the prospects for developing PHP on IIS, but submitting the report to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_evangelist"&gt; "evangelist" &lt;/a&gt; is unforgettable.  &lt;img src = "https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/310/696/cc4/310696cc4aa41851d1a0eb989287d04e.jpg" width = 450 height = 337 border = 0 alt = "Evangelist Drew Robbins" hspace = 10 10&gt; Maxim Rossomakhin once again told about microformats.  In the hall, universal support was not particularly felt, and in my opinion nothing.  HTML is what world content is wrapped up now, no matter what we want.  So let this content now acquire at least some semantics - this is in our hands.  It's funny that after the conference, when Maxim Baryshnikov and I looked at the recursive reporters at the transition from the Kitay-Gorod metro station, the definition of ‚ÄúThe semantics of the Moscow metro‚Äù arrived. In conclusion, Alexander Anokhin once again surprised me with patterns of overcoming psychological inertia at such a large enterprise as AVTOVAZ .  This time they took, and they started their countless corporate applications on LDAP.  PHPCONF has traditionally left enough food for thought and something has already been included in the outline of future projects.  I talked to various participants and heard a lot about the fact that every year the conference gives such a shake up, makes them optimize their approaches, introduce new technologies, gives a hint of further development.  This is a real salvation from creative stagnation.  &lt;/ habracut&gt; </video></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/9006/">https://habr.com/ru/post/9006/</a></p>
