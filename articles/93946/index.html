The old <a href="http://habr.ru/">habr.ru</a> and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/">habrahabr.ru</a> addresses <a href="http://habr.ru/">are</a> now used exclusively for redirection.  Habr begins a new great and exciting story. <br><br> <a href="https://habr.com/company/tm/blog/93946/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-4/ez/f_/-4ezf_enxvxyaphobmwtmv_hie0.png"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  What's happening? </h2><br>  Habr was conceived as an industry project, interesting to those engaged in the high-tech industry.  When it started in 2006, few people imagined that with time a small industry website would turn into a market giant.  In a fairly short period of time, Habr gained popularity, rose and influenced other online projects using similar mechanisms for creating and filtering content, as well as rating users. <br><br>  Years passed, Habr passed through the stages of maturation, changed and every year became more and more extensive.  Now the audience of Habr and the projects that have emerged from it at different times is 12-14 million unique users per month.  This is a large audience, according to our feelings, the largest possible audience of Russian-speaking users who are interested in information technology.  No one, not only in Runet, but throughout Europe, has such a concentrated audience.

      A few years ago, we began to wonder more often ‚Äúwhat is next?‚Äù.  The unique audience of the project has reached its extreme point, our current monthly audience is, of course, a lot, but we are not only idealists by nature, but also maximalists, and this is not enough for us.  Therefore, in order to find new growth points, shake things up and get ourselves involved in a new big story, we decided to go to the global Internet. <br><br>  And we have everything for this.  Firstly, our audience is fluent in English, because it is impossible to program without knowing English, if you're a 1C developer.  Secondly, our users actively read English-language sites, and thirdly, they still seek to share knowledge with other users.  And fourthly, on the <a href="http://toster.ru/">Toaster</a> every month they ask the same question that interests many: <a href="https://toster.ru/q/30415">what are the analogues of Habr abroad</a> ? <br><br>  You will be surprised, but there are really no analogues, not counting clones.  Moreover, there are examples that demonstrate that the project created in the likeness of Habra, focused on the global audience of developers in a certain aspect can be successful.  For example, the site named kukuruku.co, named after chocolate bars of the same name, where translations into English of the most interesting publications from Habr are not regularly posted.  Using this project as an example, you can see that the idea to translate cool Russian texts into English and sow them in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/">reddit</a> and <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">hackernews</a> works.  For example, the popular publication " <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/251451/">USB killer</a> ".  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/dark_purple/" class="user_link">Dark_Purple</a> placed it on Habr√© in 2015, currently it has 366 thousand views.  While the <a href="https://kukuruku.co/post/usb-killer/">text translated into English has</a> now 787 thousand views.  Feel the difference?  And this statistic best illustrates our motivation to start big changes: <br><br><div class="oembed"><twitter-widget class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered" id="twitter-widget-0" style="position: static; visibility: visible; display: block; transform: rotate(0deg); width: 500px; margin: 10px auto; max-width: 100%; min-width: 220px;" data-tweet-id="981260045542334464"></twitter-widget><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br><h2>  Search for a way to enter the global market </h2><br>  Initially, we considered launching a stand-alone project exclusively for an English-speaking audience.  We did not want to start under the brand Habrahabr, suggesting that this name will be difficult to understand among native English-speaking users.  The year 2018 is in the courtyard, Tesla flies in space, Roskomnadzor deliberately breaks the Internet‚Äôs performance and creates difficulties for thousands of companies, but so far even Russian-speaking users do not always correctly write / pronounce the name of our main project (HabrHabr).  It is easy to imagine what will begin when we are with this - by the way, cool and cool despite all the name - we will operate on the global Internet.  Another reason is that we did not want to associate the project with the so-called "Russian hackers", who in the West at that moment were seen literally everywhere.  Therefore, we planned to start on a separate project that would repeat the functionality and ideas of Habrahabr.  We decided to test the hypothesis, can we repeat Habr, but among the English-speaking public? <br><br>  We searched for different variants of the name, but all the good and most suitable ones turned out to be expensive for us.  For example, we really liked the domain pushpull.com, but the owner requested an excessively high price.  There were other options, but I couldn‚Äôt find a suitable one until one day I came across an ad for the sale of the domain name habr.com in the store for nic.ru. <br><br>  Seeing the ad, I thought.  Why not drop all these prejudices about ‚ÄúRussian hackers‚Äù and enter the market with the Habr brand already established in the minds of developers?  I immediately wrote <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/umputun/" class="user_link">umputun</a> , one of the oldest users of Habra from among those who live in the USA, and asked them to clarify with native Americans how they would read the name Habr.  As I expected, it turned out "Hebr."  Then I wrote to my mentor, the founder of <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/badoo/">Badoo,</a> Andrey Andreyev, and asked to ask the British in the London office how they would read the name Habr.  ‚ÄúHabr, Habr, Habr‚Äù, - voices were heard from the audio recording, which Andrew sent in response message. <br><br>  So, this is exactly Habr.  The name is already known to a large audience of developers, it can be recognized by hearing and glance with little or no error and any misunderstanding, so it was decided.  It remains only to buy the domain name.  Having bargained with the seller, we made a deal and after a few weeks we became the owner of the domain habr.com.  Now it remains to update the identity and you can start releasing long-awaited releases. <br><br><h2>  What's next? </h2><br><h3>  Internationalization </h3><br>  Now we are engaged in the internationalization of Habr and plan to begin rolling out new features in the coming months.  This is a big stack of tasks, we are moving through iterations and as soon as we are ready to submit a new functionality, we can start <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/tm/blog/347068/">testing it</a> .  Simplified, the internationalization scheme will look like this: users will be able to choose not only the interface language (rus, eng), but also the content language (rus, eng) they want to see on the site.  Publications in tapes, hubs and user profiles can be read in several languages, similar to company blogs.  Habr will be a truly multilingual project with extensive features *. <br><br><h3>  geektimes.ru ‚Üí geektimes.com </h3><br>  Yes, <a href="http://geektimes.com/">Giktayms</a> will receive similar opportunities and will also be localized.  In addition, in the near future we will transfer part of the hubs from Hiktaimes to Habr.  There will be only uchpopop, gadgets, astronautics, science and others that do not intersect with Habrom subjects. <br><br><h3>  Team </h3><br>  Over the past year, our team has almost doubled, now we have about 45 people, including remote employees.  But we are growing and are happy to see in our ranks new people with burning eyes.  We need developers, translators, editors, managers and people of other professions needed to create successful projects.  If you want to join, just email us at <a href="">job@habr.com</a> and tell us what you can do best and why we should invite you to the team. <br><br><h3>  Investment attraction </h3><br>  Despite the fact that we have long been a profitable company and we have funds for development, we are now considering the issue of attracting investments for a vigorous expansion into the global market.  If you are interested in moving with us towards this goal, write to us at <a href="">welcome@habr.com</a> . <br><br><h2>  Appeal to users </h2><br>  Users are the most important thing on Habr√©.  Together we have already built the largest technology product development community in Europe.  It is time to make Habr known not only among Russian-speaking, but also among English-speaking developers.  We have everything for this: strong brand, product, users and unique content. <br><br>  You can recall not many companies that have successfully got into the big Internet, reaching the ceiling in the local market.  But we decided to try;  we are sure that we will succeed.  We want to get a new and interesting experience, we will be telling in our blog about how we are moving towards our intended goal.  So support us.  If you are the author of Habr, think about the translations of your publications;  Very soon you will have a reason to place them on the site for a new audience.  If you have not yet become an author, then soon there will be another reason for dedication to favorites. <br><br>  <font color="999999">* - <i>After talking with colleagues, we decided not to talk about all the plans, so that there was a slight touch of understatement.</i></font>  <font color="999999"><i>This text is an explanation of why and why we decided to become a global company.</i></font>  <font color="999999"><i>Stay tuned for updates, they will follow very soon and you will see what we have in mind.</i></font> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/93946/">https://habr.com/ru/post/93946/</a></p>
