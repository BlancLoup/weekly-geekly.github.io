  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why do I need to use the php-framework'i, for example codeigniter</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It was inspired by yesterday's night talk in the ace with one non-programmer.  Having learned that I use codeigniter in my projects, he doubted my professionalism ... And, as I understand it, this is not only his opinion, many do not recognize the framework, and I will tell you that this is not from a great mind!  Take, for example, windows programmers, why does someone advise them not to write on pure Pascal, instead of Delphi, and how did it happen that si-shniki use visual studio?  Today I will tell you about the benefits of the php framework, using the example of my favorite codeigniter, highlight the main advantages of this programming method, tell you how easy it is to learn, and show you where to read more. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Before you start </h4><br><ul><li>  Attention!  It is important to understand that codeigniter makes life easier only for those programmers who know php very well!  If you are just starting to program, while you learn ... </li><li>  Codeigniter implements only basic functions, such as working with a database, CNC, paginated output of records, output of a calendar, upload files ... That is, the most common, most of the functions you still have to write yourself. </li><li>  Codeigniter does not do your job for you, it only helps you ... as far as possible ... </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Why use codeigniter. </h4><br>  In every programmer's life, there comes a time when speed and quality of development come to the fore.  This means that the programmer has become a professional.  That is, I can‚Äôt give anyone the thread from friends a link to my last project, and say ‚Äú <i>Look, what kind of CNC I implemented in the project</i> ‚Äù, because this CNC implemented for me codeigniter, but I saved a couple of three hours, a lot of nerves, and confident in the quality of implementation.  So what's good about framework in general, and codeigniter in particular? <br><ul><li>  Allows you not to bother with the little things, and focus on the logic of the project. </li><li>  Saves a lot of time </li><li>  All your projects will have the same structures in the files, which rejects questions like: ‚ÄúDamn, where did I put the config for the database, half a year ago, when I wrote this fucking script ?!‚Äù </li><li>  Many functions in it are implemented more intelligently than you would implement them yourself. </li><li>  Extensibility  If you need an implementation of some kind of function, and you are too lazy to write it yourself, it is highly likely that you will find the necessary plugin for codeigniter in the Internet.  Also, if you have your own implementation of the function you need, which you constantly use in your projects, nothing prevents you from arranging it as a plugin (Helper). </li></ul>

      Of course, this is not all virtues, this is so, what immediately came to mind.  Express the above list in three words: <b>Speed, convenience, quality.</b> <br><br><h4>  Switch to codeigniter </h4><br>  Many programmers are afraid of everything new, because mastering a new technology takes time, better old, but familiar, than new, unknown and not always the best.  I will say right away that the codeigniter is better, and it took me no more than a day to study it.  Here, it should be noted that we are talking about the codeigniter, because  the development of zend'a will take much more time.  The transfer to my Cms codeigniter took me only a couple of days, and that, of course, was worth it! <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  ‚ÄúH <i>y and cho?</i>  <i>He absolutely did not reveal the topic!</i>  <i>Not a line of code!</i>  <i>No specific example!</i>  <i>What for!</i>  <i>I'll go to Google, try more in detail, cho for codeigniter ...</i> " <br>  And if it's your thoughts, then I got my way.  The purpose of this article was not to teach you to program on codeigniter, I just wanted to interest you, tell you about this technology, and other sites will teach you: <br>  <a href="http://code-igniter.ru/">http://code-igniter.ru/</a> - CodeIgniter in Russian. <br>  <a href="http://codeigniter.com/">http://codeigniter.com</a> - Official site. <br><br>  Program intelligently. <br>  Your voff. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/38696/">https://habr.com/ru/post/38696/</a></p>
