Owners of previous versions can upgrade for free.  In this post I would like to run through the innovations that pleased me the most. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/132/c8f/87f/132c8f87fc8625a4de75bd37441b6acf.png" alt="image"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  It was nice to see how during the beta updates with enviable periodicity came out that made the program even better.

    <h5>  Ui </h5><br>  Close attention was paid to the interface.  There was a huge number of hotkeys for basic actions, a quick transition was added using tabs between elements of a separate screen or between the screens themselves (ctrl + tab).  The number of switching between the keyboard and the mouse has decreased, the distance between the controls has decreased within the framework of common user scenarios. <br><br><h5>  Interactive </h5><br>  Added a lot of actions that the user can perform in the generated prototype and get feedback.  Double click, long click, mouse over an item, swipe, keystroke.  Events with a browser window: resizing, scrolling, right-click and so on.  All these and many other actions are now at the service of designers. <br>  The list can be impressive, but I promised to tell only about the most interesting. <br>  Actions with dynamic panels: <br>  - You can pull the first state of the dynamic panel on the workspace; <br>  - With all the widgets now you can do what you could do only with dynamic panels: hide, move, change z-index; <br>  - In the event ‚Äúshow‚Äù for the widget, you can specify one of the types of behavior, the emulation of which used to take a lot of time: lightbox, a drop-down menu, move to the top layer of the scene.  And now you can make it so that when a hidden widget appears, all the others are shifted down a distance equal to the size of this widget. <br><br><h5>  Prototype generation </h5><br>  Added button "Preview".  Now you can view intermediate results in the browser without generating a prototype.  Moreover, the changes are applied instantly. <br>  Added the ability to attach any fonts, but this is more for the UI than for the UX.  But many will be pleased, yes! <br>  In the generated prototype, you can highlight all clickable elements. <br>  Now all the links in the browser row look like human beings.  You can give the client a link to any prototype page, no longer bothering with a special button in the site tree. <br><br><h5>  Styles </h5><br>  Since now prototypes are generated according to the html5 standard, the corresponding styles have appeared: internal and external shadows for widgets (including text), the level of transparency of any widget (including pictures), the background for dynamic panels, and so on. <br><br><h5>  Widget properties </h5><br>  Almost everything turned out to be useful here. <br>  - Default values ‚Äã‚Äãfor text fields that disappear when you click on them; <br>  - Types of text fields (email, phone, url, and so on).  This is necessary so that the desired keyboard appears on mobile devices when you click on them; <br>  - Automatic width and height of text widgets.  This was not enough for us from the very beginning.  Now you do not need to set the width of the text widget by eye with a small margin for different browsers; <br>  - Actions in the dynamic panel can now access objects outside this dynamic panel.  That is, now I can do without a tambourine, so that when I click on a button in one of the states of dynamic panels, something happens in one of the states of another dynamic panel on the same page (or in the wizard, if you like). <br><br><h5>  Adaptive species </h5><br>  Yes, now you can make adaptive prototypes.  For each adaptive view, you will need to draw a separate version and specify at what width of the browser window it will be displayed. <br><br><h5>  Repeaters </h5><br>  Probably a good thing, but so far I do not see any way of applied use.  In a nutshell: they allow you to emulate lists with filters and page-by-page navigation.  But in practice, it is faster to draw up lists in the old manner in statics and on masters. <br>  I want to finish the review on the fact that I listed only a tiny part of the changes in the seven.  I work with this version from the first beta and compared to 6.5, the speed of work has increased by no less than 40%.  This is a decent figure. <br><br>  The cost of the standard version of the product is $ 289 and this time it is worth the money.  As usual, you can use the free version for 30 days. <br><br>  Oh yes, I almost forgot!  The <a href="https://share.axure.com/">axshare</a> prototyping <a href="https://share.axure.com/">service has</a> now become free and all restrictions imposed on non-pro accounts have now been removed.  You can publish 1000 prototypes up to 100 megabytes each, customize the input page and domain on which the prototypes will be placed. <br><br>  In connection with the release, the <a href="http://www.axure.com/">official website of Axure has been</a> completely updated.  <a href="http://www.axure.com/learn">New video tutorials appeared</a> (for the time being, the total duration is about an hour) and old articles are rewritten. <br><br>  If you have difficulties with English and have questions about work, contact me in the <a href="http://vk.com/axure">group</a> , it is warm and comfortable there and everyone is ready to help each other. <br><br>  Also, from time to time I post tutorials on common tasks on my <a href="http://www.youtube.com/ekamelev">YouTube channel</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/206574/">https://habr.com/ru/post/206574/</a></p>
