Today I will talk about our experience on ProductHunt after reading the publication <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/pibox/blog/19138/">‚ÄúHow we went on Product Hunt‚Äù</a> and what we got from it.  Those wishing to familiarize themselves with our experience, please under the cat. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Almost immediately after reading the first publication in the corporate blog of Pibox, I contacted the head of <a href="https://megamozg.ru/users/soul2007/" class="user_link">Soul2007</a> and we talked a bit about marketing, promotion, and our experience in this area.  I was very interested in ProductHunt, since my colleague already had a successful experience and, most importantly, it seemed to me at that time, the promotion on this site should give a certain information surge at minimal cost.  As it turned out, my expectations were somewhat high. <br><br>  After reading the article in the Pibox blog, the first thing my team contacted ProductHunt moderator <a href="https://twitter.com/erictwillis">Eric Willis</a> and for several days we discussed the content of our page on ProductHunt, its requirements for our landing page and the time of publication.

      By Friday, we did a few important things that were mentioned in the publication on the Megamind and about which Eric told us. <br><br>  Landing page - <a href="http://hack-store.com/producthunt">http://hack-store.com/producthunt</a> <br>  We prepared Mediakit - <a href="">http://hack-store.com/Screensots/HS_MediaKit.zip</a> <br>  Made a description of our project <br>  Conducted additional testing <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d28/aec/2a9/d28aec2a963446afb767e9e20693e4b2.png"><br><br>  As soon as everything was ready, as agreed we were published on the morning of Friday, September 11.  Immediately after the publication, it became clear that the ‚Äútraffic explosion‚Äù about which Ruslan spoke was rather ephemeral.  Taking into account that Top Hunter published us and at the start our friends from MacPaw and Pibox put about 30 likes, we immediately hit the top 10. On average, in an hour we received about 10 likes.  By the middle of the working day, we were able to get to the top 5 and gain 105 likes, during which time we received about 100 downloads of our application.  Unfortunately, the amount of traffic was several times less than what I expected - for all the time I stayed on ProductHunt, we received only 567 downloads of our application and about 3,000 transitions to the site.  The dynamics of transitions and the geography of clicks can be viewed at the <a href="http://bitly.com/HS_PH%2B">link.</a> Also, a strong information surge was not noticed, as well as offers from investors and media attention.  I note a negative point, by the end of the day we were overtaken by useless but ‚Äúfunny‚Äù projects such as <a href="http://www.producthunt.com/tech/jony-jive-2">Jony Jive</a> , <a href="http://www.producthunt.com/tech/cat-street-view">Cat Street view</a> gaining 200 or more likes on the first day, I think that this is the main minus of ProductHunt, every day a lot of informational garbage is published. <br><br>  So, we received 200 likes on the first day, 8 hours kept in the top 5 and remained in the top 10 with 206 likes.  Received 600 downloads and about 3000 transitions as well, I was invited to Slack chat with administrators of ProductHunt.  What will come of this, time will tell. <br><br>  In conclusion, I would like to draw conclusions from our experience: <br><br>  1) ProductHunt is almost useless for a successful project. <br>  2) If on the day of publication any big event is planned for Apple, Google or other giants you will not get to the top 5 <br>  3) Do not think that immediately after the publication to your project there will be a lot of attention, be able to wait <br>  4) Keep your finger on the pulse and try to respond promptly to users to get feedback. <br>  6) Even if you type 10,000 likes of unlikely traffic with ProductHunt will be more than 40,000 <br>  7) Get ready for the fact that you will be overtaken by useless but "funny" projects <br>  8) You will get a lot of feedback and be able to understand the expectations of your audience. <br><br>  Thank you for reading, waiting for your thoughts and comments.
