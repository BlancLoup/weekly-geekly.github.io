Her sister's friend apologized for his mistake.  Many people laughed at the fact that this story once again shows how confusing and confusing the settings on Facebook are, and that ‚ÄúEven Zuckerberg really doesn't know how to use it!‚Äù <br><br>  This would have ended the case if Randy had not brought history to a new level by posting on her twitter: ‚ÄúDigital etiquette: Always ask permission before publishing other people's photos!  This is not about privacy, this is about Human Decency! ‚Äù

      Yes, she said "Human Decency."  This stupid story about her muddy photos is very important. <br><br>  So important that Randy Zuckerberg, who by the way is the vocalist in an obscure rock band with the amazing name FeedBomb, is also the producer of the terrible reality show about Silicon Valley (see Bravo's Silicon Valley: The Painful Truth Behind A Caricature Of Excess), she same - the sister of the guy who created the beacon of morality on the Internet, better known as Facebook, decided to use this story as a teaching moment, by the example of which, she will teach the world ‚ÄúBasic Human Decency‚Äù. <br><br>  Let's admit that Randy Zuckerberg is not Mark Zuckerberg.  But let's also acknowledge that she gained enormous benefits from the creation of her brother. <br><br>  And what did he create? <br><br>  A company that earned billions by collecting personal information from people and using it to sell advertisements; <br>  The company, whose initial confidentiality agreement was one sentence, but now has become more than the US Constitution and requires a law degree to understand the meaning; <br>  A company that constantly pushes people to ‚Äúshare‚Äù their personal information in order to use Facebook; <br>  The company, which only four days ago was criticized by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, for another creepy experiment that will allow people to pay money to send an email to your email inbox; <br>  The company, which claimed that it does not follow the users who logged out from Facebook, then acknowledged this fact, and now has applied for a patent describing the system that does just that; <br>  A company that has fallen upon a clumsy attempt to launch a secret slanderous campaign against Google; <br>  A company that has already received and settled claims from the FTC about misleading users and violating federal laws; <br>  A company that conducted a dirty IPO, misleading investors; <br>  The company, which is still under investigation by the authorities of the state of Massachusetts, which has already led to banker fines, and how this will end is not yet known; <br>  The company, which first changed the Instagram user agreement, but received a flurry of discontent quickly changed everything back; <br><br>  Yes Randy Zuckerberg, tell us about Human Decency. <br>  Because the photo you posted on the Internet was retweeted. <br>  How terrible it is!  What a brazen invasion of privacy!  This is unpleasant when someone can simply take and use someone else's personal information for their own purposes without asking permission! <br>  What kind of world is it, in which someone can use your personal data, just because you posted it on the site? <br><br>  Oh, wait ... <br><br>  Original: <a href="http://readwrite.com/2012/12/26/yes-randi-zuckerberg-please-lecture-us-about-human-decency">readwrite.com/2012/12/26/yes-randi-zuckerberg-please-lecture-us-about-human-decency</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/164797/">https://habr.com/ru/post/164797/</a></p>
