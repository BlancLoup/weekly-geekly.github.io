And for a long time I was going to sketch a note on the topic indicated in the title.  Moreover, this topic during the holivars practically does not rise.  There is a lot of talk about how network piracy kills the publishing, film distribution, music business, about how copywriting, hiding behind the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcopyright, pushes completely surrealistic laws such as Mikhalkov‚Äôs ‚Äúdiscounted percent‚Äù.  But it seems to me that in these disputes behind the trees we do not see the forest. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3f4/92a/da2/3f492ada2abc2d1cd97384dde10c0821.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      Both pirates and copywriters (rightholders) are, in most cases, only intermediaries between content creators and its readers, viewers, listeners.  They, like intermediaries, have their own tasks, their own problems, and most often they only hide behind the interests of authors and consumers. <br><br>  Pirates, in particular, talk about freedom of information dissemination, and the fact that any content (cinema, game, book, music) can be downloaded from the network freely and free is presented as an indisputable benefit and happiness for users. <br><br>  But is it really? <br><br>  In due time, having connected the broadband Internet and having got a terabyte screw, I was also pleased with a couple of months, like an elephant.  But gradually began to receive disturbing "bells". <br><br>  For example, on a computer installed more than 30 games, not counting the petty casual heresy ... And there is nothing to play.  You start the game alternately, every half an hour, and throw.  In the folder "Video Library" - dozens of films "in reserve".  But when you sit down to watch a movie, sort through this list and you cannot choose.  Again you climb into the Internet to download something new.  And so on and so forth. <br><br>  So, imagine that you love ... for example, candy.  And you suddenly put a hefty room in the room ... not even a vase - but a bottomless bath filled with a wide variety of sweets.  Take what you want, when you want what you want.  What will happen after a while?  That's right, you don‚Äôt want to see these sweets anymore.  You will poke around in the bath, take one candy, then another, biting, discarding, scattering candy wrappers, picking on the pick ... In general, this can be described in one word - <s>"zazhralis".</s>  are fed up. <br><br>  Here is the question of elementary psychology. <br>  1. A person does not appreciate what he just gets. <br>  2. The person feels uncomfortable in conditions of excessive choice. <br>  3. The conditions of unrestricted access to everything desired leads to a spoiled child syndrome. <br><br>  Personally, my opinion - movies, books, music, games should be downloaded from the network only for a fee - even if only symbolic. <br><br>  If a person downloads a film for a reason, and at least for 10 rubles - he begins to approach his choice more consciously.  He ceases to be a spoiled child who goes online with the attitude of ‚ÄúGo, entertain me.  And you should be grateful to me for the fact that I downloaded your crappy game and played it.  So - what else money?  Am I an idiot to pay for the pixels? ‚Äù  (By the way, I myself have seen quite a few real-life comments in this spirit, so this is not a far-fetched position at all). <br><br>  If a person pays at least something - he becomes a normal, sane, discriminating consumer who ‚Äúvotes with a ruble‚Äù. <br><br>  In the 10-12 years of its existence, network piracy has already transformed watching movies, reading books on the Internet, etc.  into one impetuous, mindless and soulless consumption. <br><br>  We <s>zazhiraetsya</s> become more sated and picky. <br><br>  We stop thinking that content creators should be rewarded for their work. <br><br>  More and more often, we simply ‚Äúbite on sweets‚Äù - that is, we don‚Äôt even get to know the film or the book properly - so, we glanced diagonally, and we can write another angry review on the tracker.  As they say "downloaded and crap." <br><br>  I'm not talking about teenagers, "brought up by the Internet."  For most of them, all these trends are no longer trends, but an established fact. <br><br>  PS It is not necessary to consider this post an unequivocal argument in favor of the copywriter, and I would not want it to be reduced to the old holivar again.  (Although holivars are fun, of course). <br><br>  I just want to draw attention to a specific aspect of this problem, which for some reason is rarely covered.  I repeat - the pirates and the copyists have their own problems.  And I want to talk about how piracy affects us, the users.  The fact that absolutely free and free access to any content is not always as great as it seems. <br><br>  It is interesting to hear what the habrovtsy think about this. <br><br>  - <b><b>UPD:</b> Due to the abundance of comments in the spirit of "you yourself are a ram that you cannot deal with downloaded ones and don‚Äôt transfer your problems to others", you have to make an addition.</b> <b><br><br></b>  <b>I gave my own example solely so as not to be unfounded.</b>  <b>I decided this problem for myself long ago.</b>  <b>Now I have not saved up 30-40 games on my computer for a long time - I play 2-3, and those are licensed.</b>  <b>In the folder ‚ÄúVideo Library‚Äù there are mostly cartoons for the daughter, and mostly Western sitcoms like ‚ÄúThe Big Bang Theory‚Äù or ‚ÄúHow I Met Your Mother‚Äù began watching.</b>  <b>Well, in general, in general, my 1.5 terabyte screw is now replenished mainly due to family photos.</b> <b><br><br></b>  <b>The post is not about me, but about the problem as a whole.</b>  <b>Let's in this vein and discuss.</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/152271/">https://habr.com/ru/post/152271/</a></p>
