A brief photo review of <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/muk/blog/118323/">habrahabr.ru/company/muk/blog/118323</a> told about the main properties of the e-book.  Guided by the need for a more detailed account of our device, as well as relying on the deep and informative comments made on this review, it was decided to tell the public about those features of our e-books that few people know about.  The review will discuss the important features of the e-book ABC 618. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bae/bae/f78/baebaef789cdcc64ae49c49d18366c5c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  From the experience of using email.  books from different manufacturers can be said that the most important thing in e-books is software, because if there is a good screen, but the display of the text will suffer because of non-quality software, the hardware will not save the situation.  The <a href="http://www.the-ebook.org/">www.the-ebook.org</a> portal has the ‚ÄúIdeal Book‚Äù section, where there are 24 sections with readers' wishes for what they would like to see an e-book, we tried to orient ourselves partially to these requirements when developing the software <a href="http://www.the-ebook.org/forum/viewforum.php%3Ff%3D18">www.the-ebook.org/ forum / viewforum.php? f = 18</a> .  So, here we will list all these pleasant ‚Äútrifles‚Äù that are in our e-book ABC 618. The advantages of the ABC 618 are made up of parts, which we will talk about.

      <b>1000 nice little things</b> <br>  As Jan Chihold said, a good book is a work of art that few people can see.  No matter how beautiful the book is, the whole beauty is lost in electronic form.  Electronic texts nullify all the efforts of paper book makers, all beauty disappears.  We want a person using our e-books to have the opportunity to visually customize "his" book, "his" reading, so that it is as comfortable as possible for the eyes, and not just a text display, as the bare text itself is without customization not always convenient to read.  We were guided by the fact that a person reading our book would see in front of him an almost paper book - as far as possible.  In our e-books, all these tools for flexible and full customization of text display are.  The main goal was to bring e-books as close as possible to paper editions.  It is this principle that we followed when developing software for the ABC 618, as well as for the Lbook V60 (this model of the e-book should be published in August, which will be a more detailed review, with all the characteristics). <br><br>  In particular for this email.  The books of the ABC 618 have support profiles.  Using profiles, the user can set up various text displays for himself on all occasions.  In our e-books it is possible to install additional fonts yourself.  Large selection of font sizes.  It is possible to adjust the width of the left / right, up / down margins.  If there are lovers to read in small print, you can turn on anti-aliasing - for a better display.  A necessary element of any books is correct hyphenation, hyphenations in the text should be displayed according to the rules of the Russian language, as well as according to the accepted rules of other languages.  In the ABC - 23 hyphenation tables, including for such languages ‚Äã‚Äãas Finnish and Georgian.  One click of the "ok" button in the ABC 618 removes the status bar, for example, the user wants to see what time it is and read on without any extra elements on the screen.  In the alphabet, an induction touch screen that allows you to flexibly customize the interface without additional buttons (more about the menu in the video review below).  There are initial letters in the ABC 618 - unfortunately, no one noticed this, and this very much brings the electronic text to paper editions.  In addition, after its settings, and personal profile settings, all text files are displayed in accordance with your personal layout of your personal e-book. <br><br>  In the ABC 618 program for reading - alReader, since we believe that this is the best program for reading text files.  Therefore, for the work of this program and was chosen as the platform Win CE.  The ABC 618 is the reader of one alReader program. <br><br>  In the ABC 618 there is a built-in database through which you can rank the files: by author, by genre - a virtual library is created in ABC 618, by name, by extension, by type (music is not music).  For example, I just want to listen to music now ‚Äî turn on by file type ‚Äî only music files are displayed to me, or just read ‚Äî I only see books.  Another time, for example, I want to see what kind of fonts I have - I only see fonts, etc. <br><br>  The device has the ability to edit the interface without entering the menu.  You can draw a vertical line through the entire page with the stylus and change the font size (up - increase, down - decrease).  The horizontal line changes the line spacing (from left to right - to increase, from right to left - to reduce).  And pressing the stylus at the bottom or top of the screen turns the pages. <br><br>  When you select a word or part of the text with the stylus, the context menu pops up: Add bookmark, Create a quote, Copy, Edit, Marker (about this option below), Cancel <br><br>  <b>Work with files</b> <br>  Our books are omnivores - throw there whatever you want - they will open everything.  No dancing with a tambourine, i.e.  with converting is not necessary.  In comparison with other devices where conversion is needed, it must be said that after conversion there are no references in the text, footnotes, table of contents and other very valuable elements for any book, even e-books. <br><br>  <b>Work with heavy formats</b> <br>  Even very heavy text files in the ABC 618 open quickly.  Supports covers, hyperlinks, footnotes and table of contents.  Footnotes are shown at the bottom of the page, as in paper books. <br><br>  For example, you can take a large doc-file, for example, ‚ÄúOdyssey of Captain Blood‚Äù - 2.2 MB ( <a href="http://www.pupsam.ru/sabatini/capitan_blud">http://www.pupsam.ru/sabatini/capitan_blud</a> ), and see how quickly the ABC opens it.  In addition, this file was not the table of contents initially.  After the ABC parsit file, there appears a full table of contents, the contents of the book - with the headings of the first, second levels and sections. <br><br>  The second example: a very good file format for directories - chm, a familiar lawyer uploaded the entire legislative base of Ukraine to ABC 618 (somewhere around 29 MGB - <a href="http://www.nau.ua/index.php%3Fpage%3Dmob">www.nau.ua/index.php?page=mob</a> ) - the file opened and could easily use clicking on the links, and using the search.  Attempting to open the same file on a reader of another manufacturer did not succeed, the reader refused to open the file, saying that it was too big. <br>  We decided to check everything personally: <iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/7c7CdcBE3cM%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhhE8uoJtAdqAJptU-MgINX5PsN6Cg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  If there are fans of audio books and music, then the question of space on the hard disk and removable memory cards and their volume will be very relevant.  On our books you can simultaneously listen to music and read. <br><br>  Our books are Russified.  When using the English-language menu, this is not so important, but when working with mail it is not very convenient - after all, it is not convenient for everyone to write in transliteration. <br><br>  In ABC 618, when a memory card is inserted and when the USB cable is disconnected from the PC, automatic file indexing is enabled. <br><br>  In the ABC 618 there is the possibility of marking, you can select the necessary words or quotes with a marker - the selection is saved when you re-open the document.  For example, a person reads a book in English, does not want to go straight into the dictionary, selected all the words with a marker, and then immediately looked at everything.  Or unfamiliar words he can save as quotes, they are all saved in a memo file, then this file can be opened and you can see the entire tape of saved quotes. <br><br>  For our books, you do not need to buy a cover separately - everything is included.  In conclusion of the review of the ABC 618 software, it must be said that constant updates of the software with bug fixes are being developed for our e-books. <br><br>  <b>Screen name marketing tricks</b> <br>  Vizplex and E-ink are confused as a whole, talking about three generations of electronic ink.  In fact, there are only two true generations of E-ink.  The first - it did not have a name, it can be found only on the very first Lbook V8.  The second generation - Vizplex.  Modification Vizplex at number 220 carries the marketing name Pearl.  An important role is played by the screen controller.  Even if the controller on a good screen is not of very high quality, then the screen will show poorly.  There is an email.  books without a controller, but then there must be a powerful processor. <br><br>  Here is the Vizplex and Pearl screen (NB: we only compare screens, not devices). <br>  Opened the same text - not counting the different fonts. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bae/bae/f78/baebaef789cdcc64ae49c49d18366c5c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Not Photoshop: <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/BAwDDS58xK8%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhj-j4jfDZkJhpvu0QVx1PCmA7ukkw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  But the speed of reading the alphabet and not the alphabet. <iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/FEaXnhurg8s%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhiocNgdIGcDSctUgteLDegxBx-s2g" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/c_MYRxN1ulw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhj2cn6cd482pUQxccjNk81gmgZofQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  To say that one screen is objectively better than the other is impossible - this is already a subjective matter, who likes what more.  Still need to take into account that different fonts have different perceptibility.  At first glance, it seems that Perl is, of course, cooler, but at second glance you can see that the Vizplex screen is warmer, the Perl screen is of cooler tones.  By the way, we have not forgotten about Pearl fans - in the new Lbook V60 there will be a Pearl screen. <br><br>  <b>Eat a pill, Neo!</b> <br>  It is necessary to say about this kind of device as a Foreign Ministry, or a tablet.  These devices are quite simple in contrast to the electric books.  For many potential buyers, greed is triggered - you can watch movies, play games, play ‚Äúwork‚Äù and sit in the net, and color screen and ‚Äúgive tablets of greed, only more, more‚Äù.  In the device, where there is a lot of things, each function separately is not implemented very much.  What can I say: if you want to surf the Internet, read mail, read the news - then yes, but this device is not designed to work with multi-page documents.  In el.  books screen without flicker, you can read in the sun.  E-book - a device specifically for reading, and sharpened for reading multi-page documents, it must be remembered when solving the existential question "tablet or e-book?". <br><br>  It should also be said about those general expectations from e-books in general.  Using computers, PDAs, tablets, mobile phones, where the response speed is much higher, people often expect the same speed from electronic books, which is not entirely correct. <br><br>  All of these features may seem trivial, but from them formed what is called a good device for reading.  All these "little things" are a titanic work, and in fact they often think that "it should be there." <br><br>  Where to buy: <a href="http://rozetka.com.ua/azbuka_n618/p152749/">rozetka.com.ua/azbuka_n618/p152749/#</a> <br>  <a href="http://ebooks.computerland.kiev.ua/azbooka__n618_n618.html">ebooks.computerland.kiev.ua/azbooka__n618_n618.html</a> <br><br>  Well and not to write 2 posts - a small video review of the ABC 618. <br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/W1XK5WbZzXI%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjI5pgTVmFI2qhlroBPgA2JFhtZ8A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><hr><br>  <a href="http://www.service.muk.ua/">MUK-Service - all types of IT repair: warranty, non-warranty repair, sale of spare parts, contract service</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/123024/">https://habr.com/ru/post/123024/</a></p>
