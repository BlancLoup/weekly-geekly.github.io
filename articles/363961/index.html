When you are completely absorbed by the gameplay, a rare bore will take a pulse or measure EEG. <br><br>  However, given the general passion for monitoring their own health - the benefit of the number of wearable gadgets is increasing every day - such indicators may be of interest not only hypochondriacs.  In general, we will not pull the tires - in the near future you will have the opportunity to track such information in real time: meet - NAOS QG gaming mouse ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The manipulator is equipped with sensors that measure the pulse rate, the skin-electric reflex and reaction - the measurement results are displayed on the display.

      ‚ÄúJust as athletes collect and analyze data, we want to do the same for gamers.  So to say, provide them with a deep understanding.  To give you the opportunity to understand your reactions and improve the gameplay, ‚ÄùMionixLabs, which collects money for the project through <a href="http://kck.st/1w5cTeS">Kickstarter</a> , describes its own goals.  - Players using NAOS QG will be able to share information and compare their own results with their game world partners, friends and community.  This opens up new opportunities for those who play games, shares their achievements, and also broadcasts gameplay. ‚Äù <br><br>  Sensors that track heart rate and skin-electric reflex (by measuring perspiration) are built into the optical mouse - they are located on the back of the manipulator, where the player‚Äôs palm is placed.  The mouse also measures the number of clicks per minute and the data on its movement - speed and accuracy.  During the game, the accompanying software displays this data on the screen over the main image - the displayed interface does not distract from the process and can be customized.  In addition, you will be able to receive sound notifications in case the level of stress has exceeded a specified amount. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e99/601/381/e996013814524f7f99999566da66a378.jpg"><br>  <i>This is what Counter-Strike: Global Offensive looks like when playing with NAOS QG.</i>  <i>The information is displayed on the right, but can be reconfigured depending on your preferences.</i> <i><br></i> <br>  All results are saved and you can not only analyze physiological processes, but also understand which game aspects make you react one way or another. <br><br>  MionixLabs believe that the most useful feature of their development is the ability to share your data via Twitch.  But an unusual mouse has much more interesting potential - now you can integrate biofeedback into games, for example, as promised in the horror game <a href="http://kck.st/1w5d2zb">Nevermind</a> , which tracks your heart rate and changes gameplay accordingly - the more frightened you are becomes a game. <br><br>  The company does not mention this possibility, but the API for their NAOS QG will be open and free, so any third-party developers will be able to use the unique features of the manipulator in their own software.  It should be noted that the attached software can work with almost any games and programs - as is done, for example, by FRAPS. <br><br>  At the moment, the collection of money for Kickstarter continues and for the "early birds" the mouse will cost $ 79.  At retail, the NAOS QG will cost $ 129. <br><br>  PS Article prepared on the materials of the <a href="http://cnet.co/1w5cFoi">portal Cnet</a> <br><br>  PPS We do not have NAOS QG, but there is an Xbox One, which we <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DRMJenvDnjUM">will give to the most erudite</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/363961/">https://habr.com/ru/post/363961/</a></p>
