      For me, it all started in 1969, when an experiment on the transfer of information between computers using packet-switching technology, called APRANET, was initiated by the United States Agency for Defense Advanced Research Projects (DARPA). <br><br>  DARPA was at the origin of a whole range of packet-switching technologies, including the transfer of information via radio and satellite communications, but the developers faced a serious problem: the networks ‚Äúspoke different languages‚Äù.  Each network used its own communication protocol and its own standards and formats for transmitting and receiving packets, so it was impossible to establish communication between the networks. <br><br>  To solve this problem, Robert Kahn and I developed a new communication protocol specifically designed to support communication between different networks.  We called it TCP (Transmission Control Protocol, Transmission Control Protocol) and in 1974 described it in a document called ‚Äú <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall06/cos561/papers/cerf74.pdf">A Protocol for Packet Network Intercommunication</a> ‚Äù.  Later, for more efficient transmission of information in real time, including voice communication, we divided the protocol into two parts, one of which was called the Internet Protocol (IP).  The combination of these two protocols is called TCP / IP. <br><br>  After testing TCP / IP on three different types of networks, DARPA decided to make it its main protocol.  In 1981, John Postel published a plan to transfer 400 hosts from the old NCP protocol to TCP / IP.  The deadline for the transition was set to January 1, 1983, when all devices that did not switch to the new protocol would be disconnected from the network. <br><br>  On this day there were no celebrations.  The only thing that we felt, especially the system administrators who barely managed to meet the deadline, was a deep relief.  And in memory of this event, we have only badges with the inscription "I survived the transition to TCP / IP", which everyone who has passed this difficult ordeal can proudly wear. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/334/d35/4f1/334d354f165986c02948181fb9be2d0f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  At that time, this event did not seem to be significant, but now we can say that it was then, on January 1, 1983, that the modern Internet was created, which we use.  TCP / IP was adopted as an international standard, and now it is the basis of the entire World Wide Web. <br><br>  Almost forty years have passed since the time when Bob and I developed TCP / IP, and although we had high hopes for it, we could not even imagine that the Internet would become a worldwide network in the form in which it now exists.  It is a great honor for me to be directly involved in its development, and, as a happy parent, I am glad to watch the Internet grow and develop.  I continue to do everything I can to protect his future.  I hope today you will raise a toast to the Internet with me - so that it will unite us over the coming years. ‚Äù <br><br>  Vint Cerf (1973) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c3f/102/7bb/c3f1027bb334a4c3fc9409dd1f554dbb.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Robert Kahn (1970s) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/170/169/908/1701699085ae994e6f599ef7104958f0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  John Postel <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2d8/9e9/616/2d89e96160ccc7acca8d8264f9491a7c.jpg" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/164587/">https://habr.com/ru/post/164587/</a></p>
