Americans make an exoskeleton based on "Iron Man", the film "The Game" by David Fincher inspires the creation of ARG, and "Fort Boyard", "Saw" and smart home technology - on the construction of quest rooms.

      For the first time, this game was transferred from computer to reality in 2006.  A team of several people is locked in a room, and they need to get out of there (usually in one hour), opening caches, searching for hints, applying found things, calculating codes and extracting keys.  Very similar to a computer game, but in a real room with real objects. <br><br>  The idea was in the air, so it was implemented in the USA and Hong Kong at the same time.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-life_Room_Escape_In_Hong_Kong">An article on Wikipedia</a> says that some programmers made an escape-room based on Agatha Christie by the sights of Silicon Valley, but I could not find confirmation.  In Hong Kong, these were originally campus student games.  In 2008, several colleges even merged to hold a big game for 60 people. <br><br>  But in 2007 - really "went away."  Since its opening, the Japanese company SCRAP has played games for 200,000 people (including large-scale games for several hundred people at stadiums). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In the video you can see how the Japanese are going crazy.  In general, this is similar to our domestic <a href="http://runcity.org/">Running City</a> , but SCRAP also has classic escape rooms.  Photo at the beginning of the post just from this room. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/jbPW10koNj0%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700002,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjXG5yufQnIvHv5qFYX61dvo7ELqQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  As usual, the Japanese even made a separate reality show about these games, and in 2012, SCRAP came to the United States.  From 2008 to 2012, escape rooms opened in China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia and Taiwan.  At the same time, there are more than five such companies in Hong Kong alone. <br><br>  In 2011, the escape the room appeared in Europe, and further developed independently of Asia.  The pioneer was the Hungarian company Parapark (they, unlike the encrypted majority, have a <a href="http://parapark.hu/index.php">video</a> showing what awaits the players in the room).  Since then, about 10 different companies have appeared in Budapest, offering tourists and locals to try to get out of the room in an hour.  According to Tripadviser, all these are sights from the category of must-see. <br><br>  In addition to Hungary, there are escape rooms in the UK (London), Switzerland <br><br>  In December 2012, the first escape-room was opened in Moscow - phobia.ru, in the near future we should expect the opening in other cities of Russia. <br><br>  If you like the material, I will continue to write about escape-rooms. <br><br>  Who was in rooms outside Russia - write your impressions in the comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/213073/">https://habr.com/ru/post/213073/</a></p>
