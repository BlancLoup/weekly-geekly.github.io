Not everyone believes that everything is already clear.  The British company New Medium Enterprises today introduced its new development - HD VMD (High Density - Versatile Multilayer Disc) discs. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The novelty is capable of playing videos of the same quality and in the same volumes as Blu-ray, however, all other things being equal, HD VMD costs almost 2 times less.  The only disadvantage of the system is that it is not compatible with Blu-ray.  However, the company does not see a big problem in this, as the equipment for HD VMD is comparable in price to high-quality DVD players.  The average HD VMD player will cost $ 199, despite the fact that there is no Blu-ray system at a price below $ 300. <br><br>  From a technical point of view, on one side, an HD VMD disk places up to 5 GB of data, but due to the fact that the disks are multi-layered (up to 20 layers), their capacity reaches 100 GB, which is 2 times more than Blu-ray. <br><br>  In New Medium Enterprises they say that trying to unleash their development on the well-established American market, where buyers are willing to give an extra hundred or two dollars per player, is a thankless task, and therefore the company intends to vigorously promote HD VMD in the markets of Asia, Eastern Europe, Africa and South America, where buyers have significantly lower incomes.

      New Medium Enterprises notes that the players for HD VMD are almost 2 times less, because they use not the blue laser used in Blu-ray or HD DVD, but the red one, which is used in ordinary CD and DVD. <br><br>  Directly with Blu-ray New Medium Enterprises does not intend to compete so far and in the near future does not plan to take its market share.  ‚ÄúWhile we are not positioning HD VMD as a cheaper analogue of Blu-ray, we intend to promote the development as a natural extension of a regular DVD, which has received full HD-quality support,‚Äù said Shirley Levich, vice president of New Medium Enterprises. <br><br>  This format is already interested and large sellers.  According to New Medium Enterprises, in six weeks the sale of HD VMDs and gamers for them will begin on Amazon and in some offline stores. <br><br>  In addition, this format, as an economical carrier, became interested in Hollywood.  One of the largest producers and distributors of film production Michael J. Solomon (ex-president of Warner Brothers International Television) will promote HD VMD in the film industry. <br><br>  According to Solomon, in the near future, some issues related to the licensing of films and their release on HD VMD will be closed, after which Hollywood products on new media may appear on the shelves. <br><br>  Another remarkable detail concerning HD VMD: the company plans to promote its development in markets where, as noted above, the low purchasing power of citizens, as well as vacant niches in the market of HD carriers, along with China, Australia and the Scandinavian countries New Medium also places Russia on the markets where there is no widespread demand for expensive Blu-ray discs and media. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.cybersecurity.ru/hard/43611.html">www.cybersecurity.ru/hard/43611.html</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/21570/">https://habr.com/ru/post/21570/</a></p>
