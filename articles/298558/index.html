      I meet profitrolling when <a href="http://supereon.ru/services/%3Fe%3D14">introducing</a> productive communities, corporate portals and corporate social networks.  Sometimes it is found in the comments on my blog.  As a rule, carried out by long-serving employees of the organization.  The basic meaning: ‚Äúthis social network has not given up to me / us / anyone‚Äù.  The main argument: "we are already doing well."  In general, savory stuff for those who are trying to make corporate communications more open.  Let's see why people tend to exercise it.  Here is my point. <br><br>  I single out two main approaches to intracorporate social communications.  The first approach to building communities is used by organizations that unite employees in some way, but <b>without affecting business processes and work tasks</b> .  In the framework of the second approach, a <a href="http://supereon.ru/blog/korporativnaya-set-chto-ili-gde/">productive online community is</a> used as a means <b>to solve business processes and tasks</b> that require operational mass interaction. <br><br><h2>  Reason number 1.  The person is not a target audience. </h2><br>  The ‚Äúno business processes‚Äù approach is more common in organizations where ordinary employees have a lot of routine work and lack of diversity, and the staff must be involved in the work.  For example, in city-forming industrial enterprises.  In this case, the corporate social network or portal is implemented as a social superstructure over the working life of the team in combination with traditional offline events.  Offline events here are amateur contests, events for employees' children, sports competitions, help for orphanages, social funds and others.  Online events are electronic corporate media, non-business communities (see offline events), contests, and awards.  These are all necessary, useful and good deeds.  But it‚Äôs very likely that an informational employee in such an organization will see this as a second Facebook.  Because it is not about his direct work. <br><br>  In this case, I recommend to make sure that the portal is available exactly to the people for whom it is intended.  For example, if we are talking about an industrial enterprise, pay attention to the mobile application.  Yes, yes, a mobile application for workers without a PC, for example, <a href="http://www.zentranet.ru/">Zentranet</a> .  And the main thing is that the audience is already there, 70% of the population of Russia walk with smartphones, and the penetration of smartphones in the Republic of Sakha is already more than 100%. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Reason number 2.  The person was not explained why. </h2><br>  Organizations from information-intensive industries are trying to build an online community for solving business problems.  For example, discussion of quality issues, <a href="http://supereon.ru/cases/index.php%3Fe%3D1386">acceleration of organizational changes</a> , optimization of technical support, and so on.  The difficulty is that they are introducing another information system.  And they are confronted with the fact that the employees already have a head swelling from the information: customers call, email goes off scale, they get meetings, chats are distracting, the boss is itchy and there are other delights of working life.  People perceive the corporate social network as a burden, because it requires their additional attention.  And what in return?  As a rule, this was not explained to people. <br><br>  In this situation, <a href="http://supereon.ru/services/%3Fe%3D1380">look for business benefits</a> before you start developing the community.  Here are <a href="http://supereon.ru/blog/our-collection/">some examples</a> of how this happened to others.  Success in implementation can <b>only</b> be achieved <b>by replacing</b> one way of working with another.  And with a kind word and a revolver you will achieve more than with one kind word. <br><br><h2>  Reason number 3.  Corporate social network changes the structure of influence. </h2><br>  The main boss can go to his several direct subordinates.  People two levels lower can ask their question to the boss through their supervisors.  People at several levels of the hierarchy down to see their boss on TV.  Non-standard issues between different employees are solved through a common leader.  People coming to the organization have been acquiring their horizontal connections for several years.  Looks like what's going on in your company?  We have a majority of such organizations. <br><br>  According to my estimates, on average it takes up to three years to build up your contact network.  Now imagine that you have spent your years on this and are trying to squeeze you into the corporate portal / forum / group so that you can solve your questions there.  Well, what questions can you ask if you have already figured out everything you need, and you know who you need to smoke with, to find out the latest gossip?  Or imagine that a young employee no longer comes to you with his question and pleading in his eyes, because now he is asking the question to the thematic group and is building up his contacts many times faster than you.  Moreover, now your subordinate is technically able to ask an open question to your boss!  What if something is not right? <br><br>  I believe that most of you think differently and it is even better for you if for the same question you are not jerked five times a day, but will simply find your answer in the corporate social network or corporate portal (by the <i>way, I consider corporate social network the best search engine in the company or organization, I will write about it next time</i> ). <br><br>  However, there is a cultural conflict with which to work.  And this thing is much more serious than the first two. <br><br><h2>  What to do? </h2><br>  First, we must accept the fact that it is impossible to avoid profit-rolling at all. <br><br>  If profitrolling happened, you need to work with it.  Personally, if possible, in person.  If you try to dig deeper - you get good advice from an experienced employee, and he will think about the fact that maybe the online community is not such a bad thing. <br><br>  But it is even more important to find those people who support you in the development of a corporate social network or portal.  It is more efficient to invest time and energy in achieving results with allies than in arguing with opponents.  So we continue to look for allies. <br><br>  <b>Vladimir Ivanitsa</b> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ivanitsa"><u>Facebook</u></a> |  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vivanitsa"><u>LinkedIn</u></a> <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298558/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298558/</a></p>
