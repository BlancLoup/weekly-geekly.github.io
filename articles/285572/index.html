  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How I hire programmers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I go to the githab, looking for project repositories that are similar in profile to those for whom we are looking for programmers. <br>  I look through the issues, choose the right ones - those for which it does not take too much time (ideally - evening) and for which you will need to understand the project itself. <br><br>  For each job seeker, I ask for a link to a profile on a githab (or other services) or some other ways to look at what the job seeker did.  If the applicant doesn‚Äôt have a way to show his code (or, for example, there is only one repository on the githaba and the one with configs) - I throw him a link to one of the issues and ask me to send me a link to pull request when done. <br><br>  By pull request, I can immediately see how the applicant knows how to understand someone else's code and how he writes the code.  I do not give classical test tasks - this is killing time to nowhere, this code will be thrown away, it will not help anyone solve any problem. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I do not ask why the hatches are round and I will not ask until I see a scientific study that proves the link between a person‚Äôs ability to answer such a question and how well he will perform the tasks we need.

      I do not ask why you chose our company, because it will not show how well you will work. <br><br>  I do not focus on your personal qualities.  Because building a model of work in a team that takes into account the personality of each of the workers is the task of the manager, and filtering candidates by personal qualities is managerial impotence. <br><br>  When you come to an interview - you are already taken.  Because I already know about your knowledge and capabilities.  I can only show you the future place of work, and you - to sign an employment contract. <br><br>  Every month I look at what you did.  What they worked with, what they learned.  I make a sketch, in some kind of "resume" on you.  And then I look for vacancies under this ‚Äúresume‚Äù.  It helps to understand how you look in the market, it is important.  I need to know what others will offer you for your skills and change the working conditions so that you do not even think about changing jobs.  You simply work, perform assigned tasks, create products.  You do not need to be distracted by going and ‚Äúknocking out‚Äù an increase from the authorities - the salary itself grows along with your skills. <br><br>  But everything is simple: get rid of duck syndrome, get out of your head all that you have ever known about hiring employees and develop a model for hiring the employee you need.  And before that, do not forget to think about who you really need.  Anyone who gives beautiful answers to logical problems?  Anyone who can write a dozen sorting functions on a piece of paper and otdebazhit them there?  Do you have such serious tasks?  What do you do? <br><br>  Not all things that are accepted in society are rational.  The best solutions are those that throw away everything except the truly rational things. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/285572/">https://habr.com/ru/post/285572/</a></p>
