  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Apple iTablet Tablet News</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Now there are a lot of new tablet PCs, for example, see the article <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/47138/"><strong>‚ÄúStylistic ST6012 Tablet PC‚Äù</strong></a> . <br>  But I think that tablet PCs can achieve popularity only if they are not reworked laptops, but fundamentally re-designed, the main goal of this project should be: <br>  1. Compactness;  2. Low weight;  3. Energy efficiency. <br>  Tablets should take all the best from smartphones like Apple iPhone and from NetBooks like Asus EeePC 900. They should have low weight and low prices (especially since there is an economic crisis in the yard). <br>  And for a tablet PC you need to develop a fundamentally new interface!  The fact is that the MS Windows XP / Vista interface was designed for Desktop PCs, and the tablet computer is not designed to stand on the table and it will be much more convenient to use it if the program interface looks more like the interface of Smartphones and cell phones. <br>  What is the conclusion: in the Tablet PC, you can effectively use the OS type: <br>  1. Apple <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_OS"><b>iPhone OS</b></a> (on the core of Apple OS X); <br>  2. Google <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_%2528operating_system%2529"><b>Android OS</b></a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Chrome_OS"><b>Chrome OS</b></a> (both on the Linux kernel); <br>  3. Nokia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maemo"><b>Maemo 5</b></a> (on the Linux kernel); <br>  4. Intel <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moblin"><b>Moblin for MID</b></a> (on the Linux kernel); <br>  5. Palm <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebOS"><b>webOS</b></a> (on the Linux kernel); <br>  6. MS <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Mobile"><b>Windows Mobile 7</b></a> or <b>Windows CE for MID</b> (both on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows_CE">MS Windows CE</a> core). <br>  I think that most likely the first truly comfortable and popular tablet will be able to release only Apple!  It will most likely come out in 2009, with a new OS (based on the Apple iPhone OS), and its hardware will not have an Intel CPU, but a processor developed based on the ARM core! <br><br>  In September 2008, I published an article on "Habr√©" <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/iTablet/40069/">" <strong>Steve Jobs again trying to invent Dynabook!</strong> "</a> In which he tried to prove the above ideas. <br>  And today, I propose to see and discuss the review of news that has accumulated over the past 2 years, in which rumors or indirect confirmations of the upcoming release of the Apple iTablet Tablet PC or Apple iTouch Tablet have surfaced. <br><br>  The news is located from the bottom up - the most recent on top: <br>  <strong>40. <a href="http://deepapple.com/news/36061.html">‚Äú</a></strong> Will the <strong><a href="http://deepapple.com/news/36061.html">Tablet Poppy be shown on January 26?‚Äù</a></strong> - 24/12/2009: <br>  "... Well-informed sources from Silicon Alley Insider reported on Cupertino‚Äôs plans to present a tablet with a 7-inch screen in January next year. <br>  And the Financial Times technical analyst David Gelles reported - Apple bought squares for several days at the notorious Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, which has already been used several times to conduct Apple‚Äôs special ‚Äúspies‚Äù. <br>  The estimated date of the new presentation is January 26, 2010. <br>  Almost simultaneously with all this, it became known that Apple had contacted a number of iPhone-developers with a proposal to prepare their programs for demonstration in a certain ‚Äúfull screen‚Äù mode, which will make it possible to successfully pass the usual limit on the screen resolution of 320 √ó 480 pixels. <br>  The final touch to all of the above: according to Nick Bilton from New York Time, in Cupertino, work has been going on for many years on the tablet Mac, but only now the coveted device has been brought to the level of a full-fledged product.  Quoting a nameless high-ranking Apple employee, Steve Jobs is ‚Äúincredibly pleased with the new gadget‚Äù ... ‚Äù <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <strong>39. <a href="http://lenta.ru/news/2009/10/27/apple/">‚ÄúApple told about the Internet tablet to Australians‚Äù</a></strong> - 10/27/2009: <br>  ‚ÄúApple sent the specifications of its tablet device to several Australian media companies, The Sydney Morning Herald newspaper reported.  The corporation has offered addressees to supply their materials for the tablet using a special application. <br>  The device specifications are not disclosed, and Apple has not officially confirmed its existence.  The authors of some publications believe that the development of Apple is a device with a 10-inch touch screen, similar to the big iPhone. <br>  It is assumed that Apple intends to conquer the e-book market using a tablet.  Some journalists argued that the device would allow viewing color magazines, bringing their reading as close as possible to scrolling through real paper editions. ‚Äù

It will not be based on an Intel processor, which means that the standard assembly of Mac OS X will not work for the device.
