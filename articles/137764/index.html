  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Sociological aspect of the problems associated with copyright</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The recent hype associated with SOPA, PIPA, ACTA and reading a number of online articles analyzing copyright issues made me think a bit about this issue and consider it from an amateur sociologist's point of view as well as from a person's point of view and semi-professionally engaged in creativity as a programmer and screenwriter.  I will immediately say that a number of conclusions outlined below may seem naive, since I have not conducted any in-depth research, and build a logical chain only on the facts glimpsed by me from the information flow for many years. <br><br>  Let's start with the output.  And the conclusion I got next ... <br><br>  Problems with copyright, caused by the proliferation of the Internet and means of digital data processing are insoluble in principle within the framework of the modern civilization structure.  It is civilizational, and not technological, market or legal.  No technological, no legal and no market methods to solve the problems will not help - all this, speaking in common language, "that the dead poultice."

        </script>
      <br>
      And now we will try to justify this conclusion point by point. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  The nature of creativity and money </h5><br>  Any person who has read at least a little literature on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethology">ethology</a> , as well as himself engaged in creativity, it is obvious that creativity is based on two instincts - the game and the sexual.  And if the first of them is used (or can be used) to enhance social status only indirectly, or not at all, then the second is directly related to a set of hierarchical and territorial instincts. <br><br>  And since in the modern world, money is the ultimate materialization of hierarchical instincts, practically all technological, legal and market-based methods for solving problems with copyright ‚Äúfrom below‚Äù (from the people) can be reformulated in one phrase - <i>‚ÄúDear authors, immediately stop using sexual instincts for creativity, and from this point on use only play! ‚Äù</i> <br><br>  This is possible.  But only in the following situations: <br>  a) sexual instincts are blocked at the physiological level - for example, due to overpopulation; <br>  b) the most sexually active individuals in the population are destroyed through spontaneous or planned genocide; <br>  c) there is a massive substitution of concepts on the instinctive, at the physiological level in order to break the link "sex = hierarchy" and introduce the link "sex = game"; <br>  d) legislative and tax restrictions on the accumulation of money by private individuals. <br>  This whole set of situations could be observed in different countries throughout the 20th and early 21st centuries. <br><br><h5>  Industrial Revolution </h5><br>  If we briefly delve into the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright">history of copyright</a> , we find that its appearance is clearly connected with the beginning of the industrial revolution, and the appearance of its modern problems is clearly connected with the end of the industrial revolution in developed countries and the beginning of a discussion of the concept of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-industrial_society">"post-industrial society"</a> . <br><br>  That is, copyright and the industrial revolution - these are two concepts that go side by side.  Although here, of course, I can be objected to, recalling the old joke about the correlation between the number of pirates and global warming (which, with in-depth analysis, may still not be a joke). <br><br>  Accordingly, the peak of problems, as everyone can see, is on the borders of social strata in developed countries and on actual and virtual borders between countries that have passed the industrial revolution and countries that are at different stages.  So, it is not worth expecting any progress in this regard until the end of the industrial revolution around the world.  But the ‚Äúgolden billion‚Äù cannot drive the rest of the world into eternal slavery! <br><br>  But as soon as the industrial revolution is completed on a global scale, all copyright restrictions will look as ridiculous as the demand now looks like to bow to a person with an aristocratic title. <br><br><h5>  Oh, brave new world! </h5><br>  Here we come to the picture of the world in which current problems with copyright are either absent or strictly isolated socially and geographically (modeled on the ghetto).  What are its main parameters? <br><br>  1. The birth rate either for reproduction of the population only or negative. <br>  2. Socialism and socially-oriented capitalism on the entire planet in options from "soft-Chinese" to "hard-Swedish." <br>  3. Approximately uniform distribution of industrial production throughout the world.  Some kind of new technological revolution, allowing to solve modern problems of this production. <br><br>  If we reject the apocalyptic scenarios, then I think the majority will agree that this is the direction in which humanity is moving.  The only question that remains is when will we come to this world? <br><br>  <i>This article is distributed under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">the Creative Commons BY 3.0 license</a> .</i> <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/137764/">https://habr.com/ru/post/137764/</a></p>
