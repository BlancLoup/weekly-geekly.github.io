The very next day, a friend of mine, in which, by the way, dofiga recruiters and Eycharov, was bursting with reposts from the article and reposted with reposts of the article.  To be honest, such a full house is a bit surprising, because on the topic of ‚Äúteaching recruiters‚Äù to something has already been written dofig and troshki of every kind of posts, articles, trainings and books, and the techniques described in Habr√© are not new.  And some so even controversial.  And now, in fact, argue and ask my darling.  And by the way, to argue not only because I am on the other side of the barricades, i.e.  I‚Äôm sending these stupid job descriptions, no.  By the way, I am sending smart letters.  I also argue because I also often receive letters of work, and I can also talk a little about which sentences are being excited and which do not even fall into my memory. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  ITEM ONE - BANNER </h4><br>  Guys, remember once and for all: a banner is not an ad, but an advertisement.  Did your eyes remember the Yandex brand?  Well, that's half the battle.  Banner caused you some emotions?  Excellent!  So, you remember him, and the recruiter is already up to the small thing - to write you the correct letter with answers to all the questions listed in the article. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ffc/c59/cfd/ffcc59cfdab587e2bb67788d07dc1bcf.png" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  SECOND ITEM - DESCRIPTION OF VACANCIES </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a3a/032/553/a3a032553cb3693363fcdd5417026f8c.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Let's think about why jobs are being created?  Usually they are published on job boards and in various social programs for finding work.  The logic of their work is quite simple. <br>  Jobboard Algorithm: a programmer, who is all overwhelmed, he is under stress, he hates everyone and goes to work sites to see what other work there is in principle in the market.  Or the programmer, who soon ends the contract, goes to work sites to see if he should extend the relationship with the current employer or you can visit a couple of interviews before that.  Or the programmer knows several companies, wherever he would like to come to meet, he goes to work boards, enters the name of the company and looks at what vacancies for these companies are relevant now.  Same thing with social programs to find work, like my circle.  What are we dealing with in this case?  Since the person is already in search, he is already potentially interested in changing the employer, and now he just needs to understand how his profile coincides with the profile of an ideal programmer in a vacuum described in the requirements of a particular company. <br>  So, does the task of attracting a candidate face a job description?  It has long been gone.  It seems to me that the only task for a job is to give the candidate as much information as possible about the proposed job.  Because the one who is not looking, he will not find this job.  Accordingly, the one who reads it is looking for work. <br>  But if you go back to the question of ‚Äúenticement,‚Äù tell me, is it at all possible for a vacancy to ‚Äúsell‚Äù a position?  Actually, okay, I agree, I saw one vacancy, described in such a way that it sold, it sold the work!  Here is a <a href="http://hh.ru/vacancy/8836588">reference</a> , if anyone is interested, the only drawback of this description is that only the most persistent are able to pass this text to the end. <br>  But in general, what is it possible to write in the text of a vacancy to attract a candidate for a job? <br><ul><li>  1. Brand.  You must admit that sometimes companies have such a reputation that one name can either fall in love forever or permanently discourage a candidate for a job. </li><li>  2. Tasks.  It's harder here.  Tell me, what are the tasks facing the programmer, except for ‚Äúwriting code‚Äù or ‚Äúteaching a junior‚Äù (God forgive me!)?  Although you can include, for example, a solution to problems with sound and video, but who could expand this list? </li><li>  3. Area of ‚Äã‚Äãresponsibility.  Basically, this is relevant for such positions as team leaders or project managers, respectively, and this item can attract those who want to develop in the direction of management. </li><li>  4. What skills can be developed at this job?  And here you can enter just all the requirements for technology. </li><li>  5. Address, description of the office, buns, team.  By the way, I talked on this topic with my children, so they told me that with a large social package they don‚Äôt care, but the fact of its presence is definitely a plus for the employer.  Therefore, I think it‚Äôs not worth bothering about the description of the buns. </li></ul><br>  All these factors are undoubtedly important, but the key point for the applicant is not whether his future boss is a moron ‚Äî unfortunately, it will not be possible to describe the vacancy in the vacancy.  But there is also good news - everyone can solve it for himself, having come to the interview and having personally met the future leader. <br><br>  And the last.  About sore.  Guys, tell me honestly, how often do you send your resume on a vacancy announcement?  I would like to know how many answers will differ from "never."  For the sake of a social experiment, a colleague and I prepared job descriptions for two samples ‚Äî requirements and proposals, i.e.  accordingly, what we expect from the candidate, and what we can offer.  So far, I look at the statistics of the responses for a week, and I confess to you honestly that these descriptions work exactly the same, i.e.  no way.  But you can look at them and form your opinion <a href="http://jobs.tut.by/employer/1005038">here</a> .

    <h4>  THIRD ITEM - RECRUITMENT LETTER </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/90d/0d9/e12/90d0d9e12de29ccd150bef983153304c.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Here it is, here is what should "sell" a job!  For in his letter, the recruiter can tell something that can not be described in the text of the vacancy.  I always adjust the templates of my letters to candidates in accordance with the wishes of these same candidates, which, admittedly, is not easy, because these wishes are often different, and sometimes radically opposed, or even simply unfeasible.  For example, some do not want to read mnogabukf, while others need to know all the details.  Some people think that the conversation should be started with a specific sentence, others that it is necessary to be public and generally make it clear who I am and why I am writing to this person. <br>  And there is another question, how enticing should a recruiter's letter be?  On the one hand, the vacancy should definitely like it, but on the other hand, not every candidate who receives it will be selected by resume or interview?  Those.  there is even such a question, at what stage is it time to sell? <br>  If you sell everything at once, then it turns out an awkward situation when the candidate sends me a resume with the words ‚Äúan interesting vacancy, in the attachment is my resume‚Äù.  Agree, here it is, happiness!  And then it turns out that the candidate does not fit the resume, or even the resume is ok, but in fact (that is, according to the results of the interview) is not ice.  And how to act after this?  After all, if the description does not immediately seduce, then the summary will not come.  Not only from those who are not very suitable, but also from the most desirable. <br><br>  As for the recruitment letter itself, I would like to express myself from the point of view of the applicants as well.  Here I personally have a profile in linkedin and my circle is full of people.  If you spend 15 minutes, you can find my strengths and weaknesses without an interview.  But here I have never received a letter or proposal saying: ‚ÄúI looked at all the information about you and I see that you are very good at this and that, and these are exactly the places where we have in the company / the team lacks competence / has problems / there are white spots.  Let us come to us to work and will do what we do best with us, and we will receive from you what we lacked the most. ‚Äù <br>  In fairness, I note that I myself have never written such letters either.  The closest thing to this is admiration for the candidate‚Äôs profile, his active lifestyle, or an interesting blog.  Well, i.e.  rather compliments than matching the strengths of the candidate and our needs.  And I wisely understand that basically everyone, of course, needs the appropriate specialist to, say, recruit or write code, that's it.  But I think everyone will agree that such an individual approach would be pleasant.  Of course, it is precisely in those cases when it is possible to make certain conclusions about his work even without direct communication with a person, and in those cases when it is clear which areas in the company's work ‚Äúsubside‚Äù. <br><br><h4>  ITEM FOUR - RIDER </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dc1/ecf/028/dc1ecf0285b26c0bddb184e1de11eaee.jpg" alt="image"><br>  It‚Äôs good to start a conversation with what is interesting to a person, but at first it is still worth finding out what is interesting to him, or interesting to him, right?  Moreover, even earlier it is necessary to find out, in general, is it worth it to spend all these interesting things with him for hours, and what if he initially does not fit? <br><br>  Next on the list, I would like to discuss the wishes of the programmer, which can persuade him to change jobs. <br><ul><li>  - An interesting project - send to cart.  This is about nothing.  At this point, every particular person should be asked what interests him, because how many people, so many opinions, moreover, all the markers taste different.  To one, give the development of a new functional, to another, the scale and complex tasks, to the third, diversity.  Therefore, even if your project is interesting to you, it may not be interesting to 2/3 of other developers of the highest direction.  But this is still cool.  But what about those who have an honest project?  Here, I think, all that we can do is either to describe in detail what we have, or to speak individually with each of his wishes. </li><li>  - Work close to home.  Well, maybe in Moscow it is a criterion, but not in Minsk for sure.  At least, I would rather regard it as a strange criterion, in relation to the development of a career, skills and the size of s \ n.  Depends, of course, on the level of the candidate, the middle thread of a popular technology can choose from 10 offices, where it is convenient to get, yes.  A little more dependent on ambition.  I will repeat my opinion that there are really very few companies where I really would like to work as cool guys.  And the myths about the oversaturation of the market with such offers are very, very ... myths.  Although again, this is a matter of personal priorities.  A person has children and a wife who want to see him not only on weekends.  This, too, can be understood. </li><li>  - Large spacious office.  Of course, this is important for comfort, but applicants have never asked me about it.  They asked only about open space or the cabinet system.  This is probably even more important than spaciousness.  =) </li><li>  - Friendly team.  Any Eychar will say this to you, and so on, this is about how ‚Äúan interesting project‚Äù everyone has. </li><li>  - Worthy cash compensation.  Well, I think everyone already knows that the recruiter does not name forks, this is the norm.  And no, I do not think this is stupid.  Already written, rewritten about one job, but different levels, about the agreement to overpay and the fear of scaring away, and all that.  If you still do not agree, read <a href="http://dev.by/blogs/main/kak-prosit-deneg-na-sobesedovanii">Masha Makarov</a> . </li><li>  - Business trips.  Here again, everything is twofold.  It pleases some programmers, it pleases family not always.  And also the places of sending, and also the frequency and duration, everything is very, very individual. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  ITEM FIFTH - INFORMAL MEETING </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/632/a27/f28/632a27f2815dee526f840c1d5af2de78.jpg" alt="image"><br>  This is generally a masterpiece.  If you look a little ahead and imagine that someday in this company the specialist already hired will hold such dinners, how will he react to this?  To the fact that the company does not have life / working balance? <br>  Well, and that still confuses me at this point.  It turns out that the company seems to promise nothing good to a person, since it is so pleasing at the initial stage.  And I would understand if a specialist didn‚Äôt have any profit at all from a job change, but this way the whole market raises his salary!  And the programmer, in any case, asks for more money during the transition, if he himself was not going to leave before, so the question is, is it really that an individual approach to employment really benefits the company?  Those.  if a person is not really wanted, maybe not really needed?  After all, everyone knows that motivation is sometimes more important than competence. <br>  The question of the bonus for the transition.  I would consider such a thing, if we are talking about a transition in a short time, i.e.  days of the week.  In other cases, and what, promotion on s \ n does not count? <br><br><h4>  ITEM SIXTH - PAY OVERTIMES </h4><br>  It seemed to me that this is a legislatively grounded thing and is understood by default, no? <br><br><h4>  WELL, AND THE FINAL ITEM IS AN IDEAL WORKPLACE </h4><br>  Unfortunately, this is nothing more than a cherry on the cake. <br>  Yes, I agree, all programmers are dragged away from cozy little rooms and home furnishings.  But ... This will never be the decisive factor, that's sadness. <br><br>  What I wanted to say to all of this.  Guys, let's not fool each other.  If everything suits you at the current workplace, be a recruiter even Sasha Gray, you will stay where you feel good and comfortable.  But if the vacancy proposal made something move in your soul, it means that life is not so smooth.  Some guys, dissatisfied with their current work, are looking for good from good and not only do they want to quit themselves, they also show off.  And this is just unpleasant, because we all know what is really happening and why.  Therefore, I would just like to offer one part of the IT industry to be smarter and kinder, and the second part to be honest, and grow together and improve professionally. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/216031/">https://habr.com/ru/post/216031/</a></p>
