  <section class="page js-page"><h1>OTOPOT - a mug that will save your voice</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Welcome to the pages of the blog <a href="http://www.icover.ru/">iCover</a> !  The space of smart things that flies into our life at the speed of a hypersonic train Hyperloop every day gives a person more and more opportunities.  Smart watches, vacuum cleaning robots, fridges with touch screens and a hologram in the living room are unlikely to surprise anyone today.  But to find a popular new product that would be able to pleasantly surprise the public not only with the functionality, level of technical characteristics and build quality, but also with the original design and simplicity of the proposed solution is often an order of magnitude more complicated. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0fc/fa3/881/0fcfa38815aace7c29678d49891e26cc.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The young inventors and graduate students of Tokyo University and the University of Hosea Takeshi Katayama and Shota Kumiji creatively approached the problem and demonstrated at the recent SXSW 2016 conference in Austin, the last prototype of the Otopot decorative ceramic cup that you can find. time to ‚Äúput‚Äù your voice and remove it as easily and quickly as you pour out the remnants of an unclaimed drink.  Despite the rather modest presentation, the novelty aroused the genuine interest of a very sophisticated audience, which means there is a chance that with the start of commercial sales Otopot will find its target audience. <br><br>  It is worth noting that in 2014, Otopot was nominated for a Grand Prix and received an award at the largest national competition of original electrical equipment <a href="http://arch.gugen.jp/contest2014/entry/0033">GUGEN</a> , held in Japan annually.

In addition, it is really very convenient.  The design and principle of operation of the Hosei Takeshi cup is not technologically based on anything new - the same principle is used as in the standard voice recorder when recording voice.  But nevertheless, the authors managed not only to preserve, but also somewhere to supplement the functionality of familiar devices, while implementing the concept as nice and user-friendly. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/41f/312/a5d/41f312a5dc614ac1b1893b6f6304e46a.png"><br>  <i><sub>Embedded Capsule Design</sub></i> <br><br>  Today, an already existing and fully capable prototype of the novelty is being improved in search of an optimal and final solution.  In accordance with the preliminary plan, the final announcement is planned to be held on the Kikstarter crowdfunding platform in 2016.  Now pre-orders are accepted on the <a href="http://otopot.jp/index.html">website of the</a> Rhombus <a href="http://otopot.jp/index.html">company</a> created for the project. <br><br>  Perhaps the most striking features that distinguish Otopot from everything that has already been presented in this direction earlier are the simplicity and originality of the proposed solution.  In order to record your voice message addressed to home ones, just lift the lid and say the necessary phrases.  The total length of the message is up to 1 minute.  And you can determine the presence of the message by typing inside.  The authors of Otopot initially excluded complex circuit solutions.  The functionality of the device provides sensors brightness, sensitivity, light and movement. <br><br>  Arriving home, the addressee will also lift the lid and listen to the message, then close the cup again in case you need to listen again.  You can listen to the message within the battery charge as many times as necessary.  If you want to clear the memory of the gadget, then you just need to turn and shake the cup a little as you do, getting rid of the remnants of yesterday's tea.  The only not very fundamental limitation is the ability to save only one message at a time. <br><br>  This funny wireless and convenient concept can be successfully used not only at home but also in the office.  So the enterprising leadership in the person of directors and senior managers, who value their time, can include Otopot as part of the mandatory individual office configuration and place each employee on the desktop.  This will allow them to set their personal operational tasks ‚Äúon the go‚Äù, and for the specialists to exchange current messages with each other leaving the office as needed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/63e/1ca/c3c/63e1cac3cffc889d930346dde50ae566.png" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  <font color="¬´#6aa400¬ª">Short summary</font> </h2><br>  The disadvantages of the solution are the complete lack of confidentiality and the insecurity of saved messages, which can cause many abuses - jokes from small home-minded people who are eager to join the world of high-tech, ‚Äúwell-wishers‚Äù among office staff or among home guests, etc. <br><br>  Pros - convenience and ease of implementation, lack of wires, autonomy, compactness, the ability to preserve the unity of interior style, without sacrificing the functionality of the solution.  This is a great reason to diversify and revive emotions and charge with a positive for the new day and, finally, the opportunity to change the design and material of the mug at will, simply by moving the capsule of the Otopot Core. <br><br><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/132342242&amp;xid=17259,1500002,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhghPuhNo74nSfg54l1dA5AVOm5JtA" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" title="OTOPOT - As If Voice is Water -" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The authors promise to form the final cost of a smart cup for voice messages by the start of the company on Kickstarter, which they plan to hold this year. <br><hr><br>  Dear readers, we are always happy to meet and wait for you on the pages of our blog.
