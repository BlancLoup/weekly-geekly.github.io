  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Rostelecom: Elections Behind the Internet</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The largest Internet forum ‚ÄúRIF + CIB - 2012‚Äù did not disregard the hottest topic of the season - the presidential elections, where for the first time in the history of Russia voting could be observed in real time on the Internet.  On the nineteenth of April in the section ‚ÄúElections and the Internet‚Äù a discussion of a large-scale technological project on the organization of video broadcasts from polling stations took place, the developer of which was Rostelecom. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Boris Stepin, head of the Rostelecom's head office for long-distance communications and television, said the project, which was successfully implemented in a short time (just 2.5 months), is worthy of the Guinness Book of Records.  In the process of its preparation, Rostelecom specialists installed, configured and tested more than 91.7 thousand software and hardware systems in all regions of the country;  about 53 thousand new ‚Äúlast miles‚Äù were organized, over 9 thousand km of new communication lines were built.  In the shortest possible time 19 central earth stations of satellite communications (CZSSS) were upgraded, 4 new CSCUs were installed and about 4 thousand subscriber satellite terminals were connected.

      In addition, according to Boris Stepin, work was done to increase the capacity of 7 regional data processing centers (DPCs), which provided for the collection, processing and storage of video surveillance data.  595 specialized servers were installed in data centers, and over 142 thousand units of telecommunication equipment were installed on the company's network. <br><br>  The statistics of video connections on election day was presented by Andrei Andreev, PR and Communications Director of Digital October Group.  There were a total of 2.5 million users who went to watch videos from the sites, and 1 billion views of online broadcasts.  At the same time, the whole system worked in normal mode, without failures.  There was no overload on the network. <br><br>  According to Andreev, Internet users had access to all polling stations, except one - in the village of Chaybukh (Severo-Evensky district of the Magadan region), where the equipment was not delivered due to difficult weather conditions. <br><br>  Representatives of various volunteer election observation projects also took part in the discussion.  In particular, Roman Udot, coordinator of IT projects of the association of non-profit organizations Golos.  He noted that, according to the association, the number of observers for video broadcasts during the presidential election was ‚Äúabroad‚Äù, followed by Moscow, Chechnya and Chukotka.  According to Rostelecom, the voting procedure on March 4 at the portal <a href="http://www.webvybory2012.ru/">www.webvybory2012.ru</a> was observed by 3.5 million people who watched 7.9 million broadcasts. <br><br>  The participants in the section ‚ÄúElections and the Internet‚Äù expressed different opinions about the feasibility and future prospects of a new method of observing voting.  However, all, without exception, agreed that the tremendous work of Rostelecom to create a large-scale telecommunications infrastructure for organizing video broadcasts from polling stations deserves the highest expert marks and great human respect. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/142644/">https://habr.com/ru/post/142644/</a></p>
