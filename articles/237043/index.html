  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Java Collections Framework Reference</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> This publication is not a complete parse or analysis (does not cover the <code>java.util.concurrent</code> package).  Rather, it‚Äôs a handbook that will help novice developers understand the key differences between some collections and others, and more experienced developers simply refresh the memory. <br><br><h4>  What is the Java Collections Framework? </h4><br>  Java Collection Framework is a hierarchy of interfaces and their implementations, which is part of the JDK and allows the developer to use a large number of data structures from the "box". <br><br><h4>  Basic concepts </h4><br>  At the top of the hierarchy in the Java Collection Framework are 2 interfaces: <code>Collection</code> and <code>Map</code> .  These interfaces separate all collections included in the framework into two parts according to the type of data storage: simple sequential sets of elements and sets of key-value pairs (dictionaries).

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/65c/d6d/ce5/65cd6dce50e84d659152c482e5565f3c.png" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b><a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Collection.html">Collection</a></b> - this interface is included in the JDK c version 1.2 and defines the basic methods of working with simple sets of elements that will be common to all its implementations (for example, <code>size()</code> , <code>isEmpty()</code> , <code>add(E e)</code> , etc.).  The interface was slightly refined with the arrival of generics in Java 1.5.  Also, in Java 8, several new methods were added for working with lambdas (such as <code>stream()</code> , <code>parallelStream()</code> , <code>removeIf(Predicate&lt;? super E&gt; filter)</code> , etc.). <br><br>  It is also important to note that these methods were implemented directly in the interface as <code>default</code> medodes. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Map.html">Map</a></b> .  This interface is also included in the JDK c version 1.2 and provides the developer with basic methods for working with key-value data. Like the <code>Collection</code> , it was supplemented with generics in Java 1.5 and in the Java 8 version additional methods for working with lambdas, as well as methods that were often implemented in the application logic ( <code>getOrDefault(Object key, V defaultValue)</code> , <code>putIfAbsent(K key, V value)</code> ). <br><br><h4>  Interface Map [ <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Map.html">doc</a> ] </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/40a/eca/09a/40aeca09ac1c4cc7bdbd475a3c12fd95.png"><br><br>  <b><a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Hashtable.html">Hashtable</a></b> - the implementation of such a data structure as a hash table.  It does not allow <code>null</code> to be used as a value or key.  This collection was implemented earlier than the Java Collection Framework, but was later included in its composition.  Like other collections from Java 1.0, <code>Hashtable</code> is synchronized (almost all methods are marked as <code>synchronized</code> ).  Because of this feature, it has significant performance problems and, starting with Java 1.2, in most cases it is recommended to use other implementations of the <code>Map</code> interface due to their lack of synchronization. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/HashMap.html">HashMap</a></b> - the collection is an alternative to <code>Hashtable</code> .  The two main differences from <code>Hashtable</code> are that <code>HashMap</code> not synchronized and <code>HashMap</code> allows you to use <code>null</code> as a key and as a value.  Like <code>Hashtable</code> , this collection is not ordered: the order in which items are stored depends on the hash function.  Adding an element is done in constant time O (1), but the time it takes to delete, to receive, depends on the distribution of the hash function.  Ideally, it is constant, but it can also be linear O (n).  More information about <code>HashMap</code> can be read <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/128017/">here</a> (relevant for Java &lt;8). <br><br>  <b><a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/LinkedHashMap.html">LinkedHashMap</a></b> is an ordered implementation of a hash table.  Here, unlike <code>HashMap</code> , the order of iteration is equal to the order of adding elements.  This feature is achieved through bidirectional links between elements (similar to <code>LinkedList</code> ).  But this advantage also has a drawback - an increase in memory that the collection will occupy.  More information is provided in this <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/129037/">article</a> . <br><br>  <b><a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/TreeMap.html">TreeMap</a></b> is a <code>Map</code> implementation based on red-black trees.  Like <code>LinkedHashMap</code> is streamlined.  By default, the collection is sorted by keys using the principle of " <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Comparable.html">natural ordering</a> ", but this behavior can be customized for a specific task using the <code>Comparator</code> object, which is specified as a parameter when creating the <code>TreeMap</code> object. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/WeakHashMap.html">WeakHashMap</a></b> is a hash table implementation that is organized using <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/ref/WeakReference.html">weak references</a> .  In other words, the Garbage Collector will automatically remove an item from the collection at the next garbage collection, if there are no hard links to the key of this item. <br><br><h4>  Interface List [ <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/List.html">doc</a> ] </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/187/da1/649/187da164972c4519b6affbc4a2c6fda1.png"><br><br>  Implementations of this interface are ordered collections.  In addition, the developer is given the opportunity to access the elements of the collection by index and by value (since implementations allow storing duplicates, the search by value will be the first occurrence found). <br><br>  <b><a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Vector.html">Vector</a></b> - implementation of a dynamic array of objects.  Allows you to store any data, including null as an element.  <code>Vector</code> appeared in the JDK version of Java 1.0, but, like <code>Hashtable</code> , this collection is not recommended, unless thread safety is required.  Because in the <code>Vector</code> , unlike other implementations of the <code>List</code> , all data operations are synchronized.  As an alternative, the analogue is often used - <code>ArrayList</code> . <br><br>  <b><a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Stack.html">Stack</a></b> - this collection is an extension of the <code>Vector</code> collection.  It was added to Java 1.0 as an implementation of the LIFO stack (last-in-first-out).  It is a partially synchronized collection (except for the <code>push()</code> addition method).  After adding the <code>Deque</code> interface to Java 1.6, it is recommended to use implementations of this interface, for example, <code>ArrayDeque</code> . <br><br>  <b><a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html">ArrayList</a></b> - like <code>Vector</code> is an implementation of a dynamic array of objects.  Allows you to store any data, including null as an element.  As the name suggests, its implementation is based on a regular array.  This implementation should be used if in the process of working with a collection, frequent access to the elements by index is suggested.  Due to the nature of the implementation, an indexing call to the elements is performed in a constant time O (1).  But this collection is recommended to be avoided if frequent removal / addition of elements in the middle of the collection is required.  A detailed analysis and description can be found in <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/128269/">this</a> habratopic. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/LinkedList.html">LinkedList</a></b> is another implementation of the <code>List</code> .  Allows you to store any data, including <code>null</code> .  A feature of the implementation of this collection is that it is based on a bidirectional linked list (each element has a link to the previous and next).  Due to this, addition and removal from the middle, access by index, value occurs in linear time O (n), and from the beginning and end beyond the constant O (1).  Also, due to the implementation, this collection can be used as a stack or a queue.  To do this, it implemented the appropriate methods.  On Habr√© also there is <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/127864/">an article</a> with a detailed analysis and description of this collection. <br><br><h4>  Interface Set [ <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Set.html">doc</a> ] </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aca/208/428/aca20842816a48628772bd23d2bb0f24.png"><br><br>  It is an unordered collection that cannot contain duplicate data.  It is a program model of the mathematical concept of "set." <br><br>  <b><a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/HashSet.html">HashSet</a></b> is a <code>Set</code> interface implementation based on a <code>HashMap</code> .  Inside it uses a HashMap object to store data.  The key to be used is the added element, and the value is the dummy object (new Object ()).  Due to the nature of the implementation, the order of the elements is not guaranteed when added. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/LinkedHashSet.html">LinkedHashSet</a></b> - differs from <code>HashSet</code> only in that it is based on <code>LinkedHashMap</code> instead of <code>HashSet</code> .  Due to this difference, the order of elements when traversing a collection is identical to the order of adding elements. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/TreeSet.html">TreeSet</a></b> - similar to other implementation classes of the <code>Set</code> interface, contains the <code>NavigableMap</code> object, which determines its behavior.  Provides the ability to control the order of items in a collection using the <code>Comparator</code> object, or save items using " <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Comparable.html">natural ordering</a> ". <br><br><h4>  Interface Queue [ <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Set.html">doc</a> ] </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3ee/116/dc0/3ee116dc0d6e4775a72187f551001869.png"><br><br>  This interface describes collections with a predefined way of inserting and extracting elements, namely the FIFO (first-in-first-out) queue.  In addition to the methods defined in the Collection interface, it defines additional methods for extracting and adding items to the queue.  Most implementations of this interface are in the <code>java.util.concurrent</code> package and are discussed in detail in <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/luxoft/blog/157273/">this</a> review. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/PriorityQueue.html">PriorityQueue</a></b> - is the only direct implementation of the <code>Queue</code> interface (it was added, like the Queue interface, in Java 1.5), not counting the <code>LinkedList</code> class, which also implements this interface, but was implemented much earlier.  A feature of this queue is the ability to control the order of the elements.  By default, items are sorted using ‚Äúnatural ordering‚Äù, but this behavior can be overridden using the <code>Comparator</code> object, which is set when the queue is created.  This collection does not support <code>null</code> as items. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ArrayDeque.html">ArrayDeque</a></b> is an implementation of the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Deque.html">Deque</a> interface, which extends the <code>Queue</code> interface with methods that allow you to implement a LIFO view (last-in-first-out).  The <code>Deque</code> interface and the <code>ArrayDeque</code> implementation were added in Java 1.6.  This collection is an implementation using arrays, like an <code>ArrayList</code> , but does not allow accessing elements by index and storing <code>null</code> .  As stated in the documentation, the collection is faster than the <code>Stack</code> if it is used as a LIFO collection, and also faster than LinkedList if it is used as a FIFO. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  The Java Collections Framework contains a large number of different data structures available in the out-of-the-box JDK, which in most cases cover all needs when implementing application logic.  Comparison of the temporal characteristics of the main collections, which are often used in application development, is given in the table below: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/364/d7e/419/364d7e41907e453b8e60128cdac459dc.png"><br><br>  If necessary, the developer can create his own implementation by expanding or redefining the existing logic, or by creating his own implementation of a suitable interface from scratch.  There are also a number of ready-made solutions that are an alternative or addition to the Java Collections Framework.  The most popular are <a href="https://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/">Google Guava</a> and <a href="http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-collections/">Commons Collections</a> . <br><br>  In addition, I would like to indicate, as an additional material, a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/luxoft/blog/157273/">link</a> to the review of the <code>java.util.concurrent</code> package.  Which is a great addition to the stated material. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/237043/">https://habr.com/ru/post/237043/</a></p>
