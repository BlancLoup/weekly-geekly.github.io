  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Riddles resume. Part 2. Font also matters.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fn/tc/j7/fntcj7rzdlysdkbpkszkke1bjpm.png" alt="image" align="right">  Some time ago, one of my clients, the director of a large construction company, showed me a resume of applicants for the position.  In this stack were mini presentations of various specialists: accountants, lawyers, sales managers and IT specialists.  When he was asked what information he needed about these people so that he could decide whether to hire them or not, he replied that, in general, he himself was well aware of who was worth it.  He needed only confirmation of his guesswork.  To this end, he came to me.  From a pile of papers, he took out those with whom I would like to personally communicate and, handing me into my hands, asked my opinion about these applicants.  Having received leaflets with resumes, I thought that the director would like to receive from me not just confirmation of his thoughts, but also an understanding of what these candidates need to ask at a personal meeting in order to verify the correctness of his choice. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Asking him about which of the nominated candidates should be called for an interview and what points in the summary brought him attention, he replied: <blockquote>  Look, in the lawyer‚Äôs resume, I see his very clear understanding of the subject in which he deals.  He is a good lawyer.  I determined this by the logic and structuredness of the information presented in the summary. <br><br>  A payroll accountant is likely to be honest and manageable.  I think that this follows from the fact that the data on it is enclosed in a table.  The sales manager will most likely not sell, but he will be faithful.  I do not know why, but I feel this way.  I think that this can be concluded from the fact that the candidate wrote the resume too much about himself at first.  He even stated what they usually hide (the director meant that the applicant had two marriages, and he paid alimony to his children).

      But about an IT person, I have conflicting thoughts.  On the one hand, the completely inconsistent fields in the summary (the field on the right was very narrow, 0.6 cm, and on the left more than 2 cm), which for me means that he will listen to what he is told, and then do what he thinks necessary. </blockquote>  After listening to him, it came to mind that the director of this company is trying to save his time and not spend it on those who, from his point of view, are not needed by his company.  He draws conclusions not only on the basis of his feelings.  Though a bit haphazard, he still uses nuances that are worth paying attention to. <br><br><h3>  From general to private </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vi/22/di/vi22difmm86msqroqyefvxpq2s0.jpeg" alt="image" align="right">  Let me remind you that in the <a href="https://habr.com/post/354696/">previous article</a> some nuances of choosing the resume form were described.  It was shown what information the recruiter subconsciously reads while reading this document.  Now let's talk about the font.  The font chosen and its size matters and you can also determine from it how a newcomer will manifest himself in an organization. <br><br>  Thus, the font chosen by the applicant in the text of the summary tells us how he will do his job, how easy it will be to join the team, the degree of his conflict, the subconscious career level in the structure of the organization (to which he claims), the degree of independence in the process work.  Let's take the next resume of IT specialist. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Summary</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/el/yv/o1/elyvo16mdyqsohvynbrysx-kglc.jpeg" alt="image"></div></div><br>  In the presented summary it is clear that the candidate wrote his surname, first name and patronymic name in highlighted font size 14 pt.  In this case, below in parentheses is the name in English in italics, 12 pt.  The rest of the text of the summary also has a font size of 12 pt, but already a direct font.  This means that this person most likely subconsciously considers himself an ordinary specialist, for whom the role of a subordinate is not entirely comfortable.  He will probably seek to occupy a leadership position in the organization.  However, due to the fact that he is afraid and tries to leave work, in which he will have to bear responsibility for the result, he may not claim to be a high career position in the organization. <br><br>  Taking into account that the main points of the resume and the title of the position are written in highlighted font (these phrases also have an italic type in a compartment with a highlighted font), it can be assumed that on the one hand this employee will be well integrated into the proposed rules during the execution on the other hand, he will be a good subordinate.  Just sitting and pretending that he is not interested in working. <br><br>  By the way, this may also mean that this employee has a subconscious desire to optimize his duties, improving processes and creating more optimal patterns of interaction at the junctions between departments.  At least, it would not be surprising if such an employee would receive such offers. <br><br>  Now I will reveal some aspects of the above information.  According to the rules of interpretation of the handwriting, it can be concluded that the selected font is ordinary (not italics) - this is the author‚Äôs desire to emphasize the important for him.  People who highlight the main points of the resume, often try to follow the rules of labor regulations and the unwritten requirements adopted in the organization, which have been established and are fulfilled by the majority.  These workers try to be disciplined and are rarely late for work. <br><br>  However, this does not mean that this specialist will stay at work longer than the allotted time.  In most cases, he will try to leave work on time and not linger without a substantial reason after the end of working time.  As a rule, such workers are hard on processing.  But the presence of italics in the post (not in the word post, but in the wording of the post) indicates that in this variant it is possible to give the characteristic used in oblique handwriting.  In the writings of D.M.  Zueva - Insarov on psychographology quite well shows the difference in the assessment of handwriting without inclination and handwriting with inclination. <br><br>  Depending on which phrases in the summary will be written in italics, conclusions can be drawn about which activities for this specialist are interesting, depending on which of the summary points the author uses in italics, we will keep in mind his subconscious desire in these matters be independent and move.  That is, his internal motivators in the process of performing official duties. <br><br>  The font does not provide much information, but it complements the picture that can be obtained by analyzing the resume form.  Choosing this or that form, we do not think that subconsciously as if we are adopting other people's character traits, even some aspects of our professional career.  It's as if you came to a masked stranger to you. <br><br>  I exaggerate a little, making a similar analogy.  And, nevertheless, there is something to think about.  Considering that the <a href="https://habr.com/post/354696/">previous article</a> caused a heated discussion in the comments, let's take a closer look at the conclusions and analysis of the reasoning on which they were made. <br><br><h3>  Face to face not to see.  Large seen in the distance. </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/a0/5i/by/a05ibyl-pyyr3ql5t9ojhzq2fss.png" alt="image" align="right">  I want to slightly open the veil of secrets, which, in my opinion, give an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãsome of the approaches that I use in the preparation of the conclusions set out earlier. <br><br>  <i>So far, a resume evaluation system that I apply is not in common sources of information.</i>  <i>I would like to emphasize that the system was created on the basis of a large sample of documents.</i>  <i>It was created not for someone's order, but as a way to reduce the time when parsing a huge number of resumes in the shortest possible time.</i>  <i>For further interviews, it is important to see not only the education and experience stated in the vacancy, but also to determine which of them most closely matches the vacancy in terms of its business qualities and possible potential.</i>  <i>In my opinion, in this assessment system, there is no subjectivity because analyzing only the information provided by a potential employee, there is no sympathy for a person.</i>  <i>A personal paper is unlikely to have a personal relationship.</i> <br><br>  In order to understand some approaches to the analysis of information summary, analyze one of those presented in the previous article as a sample. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Summary Basis</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pp/0e/ni/pp0eniqx6brn8dbegxcll9x3ua0.jpeg" alt="image"></div></div><br><blockquote>  This document gives us a person who chooses a small company, a person up to 100, of a family type. </blockquote>  If you viewed not only your resume, but many similar documents passed before you, then you may have noticed that people place personal data about themselves both on the left and on the right (as a preamble from whom to whom).  Left-sided placement of data about yourself at the beginning of the document and a simple resume form listing the main points, without inserts and breakdown of data, is in most cases typical for people choosing small organizations. <br><blockquote>  I would like him to be accepted into this family and treated him with understanding. </blockquote>  Please note that in the structure of the summary some blocks are marked with headings, and some are not.  The data block about yourself is not marked at the beginning, which may mean that it is not important for the author of the document.  Most often, this is characteristic of people who are accustomed to a fatherly attitude toward themselves on the part of those with whom they interact at work.  But the second block of information about himself at the end of the resume, indicating the presence of family and children, indicates that he has good reasons for which he may not participate in corporate events if he does not want to.  He has, as it were, objective reasons for refusal, and those with whom he works should understand this. <br><blockquote>  He is not professionally defined, but he would like to have a profession in which few office workers understand.  Thus, doing the work as he pleases, no one can determine the quality of the work done.  The main thing is that in the process of work he could, without leaving the office, go about his business.  At the same time it is important to create the impression that you are doing something. </blockquote>  This conclusion can be made if we analyze the order in which the following blocks of information are written: <b>Information about yourself</b> , <b>Purpose</b> , <b>Education</b> , <b>Additional education</b> , <b>Experience</b> .  From the sequence in which these blocks of information go into the resume, it can be concluded that the author subconsciously considers himself to be a professional. <br><br>  If a person at the beginning of the document, after <b>Information about himself</b> and the <b>Goal,</b> describes in detail the education received, and immediately after that the additional education he received, then it can be assumed that he does not rely on his experience because he does not consciously consider himself to be a professional in what he does.  Either this is some subconscious desire to emphasize their superiority over their colleagues, the desire to hide behind existing knowledge, which those with whom it interacts do not have.  Perhaps there is still some interpretation of why a person who has rich professional experience puts into the forefront not the acquired skills, but the initial knowledge obtained once. <br><blockquote>  According to the selected resume form, it is also possible to say with confidence that this is an ordinary specialist who will try to occupy a privileged position in the company.  But, the main thing is that he will not be a good employee, as he is not an IT specialist, but a consultant.  It will tell you and show you what you must do in order for the system to work.  But he will be reluctant to carry out specific works.  Will delay the time, or seek help from organizations that under the contract will perform his direct work. </blockquote>  The choice of a pattern in which a person first describes the goal, then education, and not work experience is usually peculiar to graduates of schools or people who do not yet take into account their professional experience, because they put education in the first place.  What does it mean on a subconscious level: I am not yet an expert, but how can I hide it?  For them, it is important that they learn a lot, which means they can afford to give advice.  And according to statistics, this form is chosen by those who are trying to shift their work to other employees of the organization or to perform it with the help of third-party organizations.  This conclusion can be made only for those employees who have experience in the specialty for at least a year. <br><blockquote>  It is desirable that he has one leader, and this should be the head of the organization, who also should not understand what this employee does, but who trusts him.  He will be loyal to the head of the organization.  But the rest of the employees, he will make it clear that he does not work for them.  The work of employees, or the needs that arise in the process of doing the work, are not at all interesting for him. </blockquote>  So imagine the following situation: you want to buy a car.  You come to a car dealership, a consultant comes to you and tries to offer you a car, placing accents solely on the type of car, ignoring the date of issue, manufacturer and performance characteristics.  Most likely, it will cause you some confusion and discomfort.  And now think, what is the catch here?  The fact that you have a bad consultant or that this person simply does not want to reckon with your needs and selection criteria. <br><br>  The same can be observed in the summary of our it specialist.  Pay attention to a piece of the layout of his resume, in which he described the data on his professional experience.  There is a block called <b>Experience</b> , in which first comes the name of the position, then the time period, and after the name of the organization.  More often, this means that in the presentation of our applicant, they should be led by only one person.  And this person is the first person in the organization.  Indeed, in any organizational structure there are divisions and positions accordingly.  There is no indication of the name of the department and, accordingly, there is no information about it, which may be a sign that this worker is, as it were, divorced from the organizational structure.  For him, it is more important that there is a company manager who knows how to burden this worker.  The fact that his position is part of the structure of the organization, and the fact that employees must work in cooperation with the rest of the units, does not seem to matter. <br><br>  In addition, instead of official duties, he uses the phrase <b>Functional Responsibilities</b> .  The difference is obvious - for him the more significant is the function that he plays in the hierarchical structure of the enterprise, and not official duties.  Functions - the predicted or expected result of labor of workers.  This concept is general and extremely broad.  Responsibilities - the process, both duties and recommendations to the employee.  They are secondary to the functions, as well as more detailed and specific.  From what was concluded that the employee does not want to know about their responsibilities, since he is not interested. <br><br>  And in order to realize this, it is necessary to go into a rant with colleagues on various topics in order to distract them from the fact that he does not fulfill the requests of the staff.  But the result must be executed.  So, the work needs to be done either by yourself or with the help of a third-party organization that performs the task for you.  So that no one is outraged and did not indicate this circumstance, he needs to be in trust with the head of the organization. <br><br>  I think that from the above analysis it will be more clear how the conclusions were drawn on other summaries in the previous article.  You know, there is an expression: a good person is not a profession.  Therefore, in order to understand how the newcomer will manifest himself in a team and how to use it as much as possible for the organization and for the organization, it is necessary even before the interview with him to compile for himself a number of questions that will allow to reveal it.  The rating system makes it possible to determine at least tentatively what is worth clarifying at the interview with the applicant in case the information provided coincides with the applicant's expectations. <br><br>  To listen to what I am writing in my articles or not is up to you.  I do not urge you to consider what I have written as ‚Äúultimate truth‚Äù.  You can treat resume writing as a process based on your own flair.  The choice is yours! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/359465/">https://habr.com/ru/post/359465/</a></p>
