We are Anonymous. <br><br>  In your recent publication, you presented Anonymous as a threat to "the state and the people."  You also stated that secrecy is supposedly an ‚Äúinevitable evil‚Äù and that transparency is not always the right way to develop.

      Anonymous would like to remind that the state and the people, in contrast to the so-called "democratic" organizations, are different from each other and often have opposite goals and desires.  Anonymous's position is that when a conflict arises between the interests of the state and the interests of the people, the will of the people should have greater priority. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The only threat that transparency bears for the state is the threat to reduce the ability to do something that the people disagree with, without democratic consequences and responsibility for their behavior.  An excellent example is given in your report - Anonymous's attack on HBGary.  HBGary's actions could aim to benefit from security or military gain, it doesn‚Äôt matter <font color="gray">(HBGary employees tried using social engineering and fraudulent methods to identify Anonymous participants to sell this information and enhance their reputation in the security market; in addition, HBGary commissioned by Bank of America prepared falsified documents for Wikileaks in order to compromise the authentic leaks before they were publicly available, HBGary was <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/infosecurity/113296/">severely punished by hackers</a> for all of this - ln.)</font>  - the main thing is that their actions were illegal and worthy of blame.  Anonymous does not accept that the government and / or the military would put themselves above the law and use the fake clich√© of ‚Äúnational security‚Äù to justify illegal and deceptive actions.  If the government must break the rules, it must also be prepared for the democratic consequences of its actions in the next election.  We do not accept the current state of affairs when the state has two versions of events: one is secret and the other is for the public.  Lies and secrecy completely undermine the concept of self-government.  How can people decide who to give their votes to, if they do not receive complete information, what course does one or another politician actually pursue? <br><br>  After the election, the government is considered the "representative" of the nation.  In essence, this means that the actions of the state are not the actions of individuals in the government, but actions on behalf of every citizen of the country.  An unacceptable situation is when people often have no idea what is done on their behalf - behind closed doors. <br><br>  Anonymous and Wikileaks are different organizations.  Wikileaks does not promote or even ask for any actions by Anonymous.  However, Anonymous and Wikileaks share one common quality: they pose no threat to any organization until the organization does something wrong, trying to hide it. <br><br>  We do not want to threaten someone‚Äôs lifestyle.  We do not want to impose our will on anyone.  We do not want to terrorize any nation. <br><br>  We only want to take power from interested persons vested with authority, and give it to the people - to whom, in a democracy, it should belong. <br><br>  The state makes laws.  It does not give him the right to violate them.  If the state does not do anything secret or illegal, then it has nothing to fear from exposing Wikileaks and nothing to be ashamed of, as was the case with scandalous documents leaked from the local network of HBGary.  These scandals are the result of not being exposed by Anonymous or Wikileaks, they are the result of keeping those same leaks.  And the responsibility for this content may lie solely with those who made these decisions.  They, like any corrupt person, naively believed that they could stand above the law and that they would not be caught. <br><br>  Many government officials and commercial companies are worried about how they can protect themselves from such leaks in the future.  They are given various tips, from increasing security to reducing the levels of access to documents, from tougher penalties for informants to press censorship. <br><br>  Our message is simple.  Do not lie to people - and you do not have to worry that a lie will pop up.  Do not give bribes - and do not have to worry that your corruption will be made public.  Do not break the rules - and you will not have problems. <br><br>  Do not try to correct your duplicity by hiding one of the faces.  Instead, try living with one person - honest, open and democratic. <br><br>  You know that intimidate us not because we threaten society.  You intimidate us because we threaten the established hierarchy.  Over the past few years, Anonymous has proven that having a guide is not a prerequisite for achieving your goals - it may be that the proof of your own uselessness in an era when society has grown and no longer needs your support is really scary in our work.  Your real nightmare is not at all in the activist group, but in the fact that you yourself and all your principles, in the new era and thanks to the perfection of technology, are redundant conditions. <br><br>  Last, don't make the mistake of challenging Anonymous.  Do not make the mistake of trying to chop off the head of a headless snake.  If you cut off one head of a hydra, then ten new ones will grow in its place.  If you catch one of us, then ten new activists will join us solely out of anger at your attempt to suppress dissent. <br><br>  Your only chance to defeat the movement that binds us all together is to accept it.  This is no longer your world.  This is our world - the national world. <br><br>  We are Anonymous. <br>  Our name is legion. <br>  We do not forgive. <br>  We do not forget. <br>  Wait for us‚Ä¶ </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/121091/">https://habr.com/ru/post/121091/</a></p>
