Today's my article will be devoted to the topic of "alternative energy" - more precisely, the power supply system of a village house from solar panels. <br><br>  I am not some kind of ‚ÄúGreenpeace‚Äôs bruised head‚Äù who lives in the world because the pigs are made of pigs.  Because I engaged in alternative energy, I can say forcibly, I seriously engaged in it.  ‚ÄúChildren's games‚Äù in the form of buying and bringing to mind garden lanterns on solar panels that are charged in a flowerbed or on a fence in the afternoon, and are brought into the house in the evening to work as nightlights - this has been since they started selling them in stores in a nearby city.  Now I will tell you what garden lanterns should be taken and which ones should not be taken, and what should be done with those that they took so that they served you at least a couple of years. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Relatively speaking, garden solar lamps for me are divided into four types according to two strictly defined features. <br><br>  The first sign, the key to the performance of the device.

      1) With a flooded transparent epoxy photovoltaic panel. <br><br>  Here is a photo of the most typical representative of this "breed". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/575/026/5e2/5750265e2883eb7f3d91816dd04c0e79.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  As they say - "In all the stores in your city!" <br><br>  It would seem that everything is great - the solar panel is protected from everything and everything, use and rejoice.  But - in fact, such a flashlight will serve you well if the season, by next year with a probability of 146%, the transparent fill of the photocell will lose transparency under the influence of environmental conditions.  Even if you remove the flashlight into the pantry by removing the battery, it will still go to the garbage. <br><br>  2) With openly located photocells as on the old calculator. <br><br>  These are already worth looking at, since after simple refinement they can serve for several years. <br><br>  The most typical representative, similar to the first. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/03c/11d/3e4/03c11d3e43383fc41432d9789166b107.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Actually exactly the same as the first - "There is everywhere." <br><br>  The simplest refinement of this device, so that it lasts at least one season - to seal the gap around the solar panel on the lid with a transparent sealant.  Otherwise, when it rains, water will freely penetrate under the solar panel and further into the device, onto a defenseless electronic board, a small battery-pill, flow through the LED and accumulate in a plastic canopy.  The circuit does not have those currents and voltages for a colorful firework to happen, but electrochemical corrosion will quickly eat the circuit - when you open the dead device, you will be pleased with green copper oxides. <br><br>  A more complex revision involves disassembling the device and smearing the printed circuit board with electronic components with varnish to protect them from moisture.  It is impossible to smear only the battery holder, it will still have to be changed about once a year.  If you want to ‚Äúabsolutely everything was cool‚Äù - it is desirable to settle a bag of silica gel inside the device, which is periodically changed.  Then the transparent ceiling of the flashlight will not fog up when the temperature drops. <br><br>  The second sign, responsible for the "consumer properties" of the device. <br><br>  1) The type of batteries used. <br><br>  In some solar torches, tablet batteries are used, in others, little finger and finger batteries, both types of Ni-Cd or Ni-MH.  It is clear that a pinky or finger-type battery has a large capacity, and in addition to replace it, as a rule, the device is not completely disassembled, it has a battery compartment with a lid on the latch.  While the flashlight with the "tablet" must be disassembled with a screwdriver in hand. <br><br>  2) The size and number of solar cells. <br><br>  The size of solar lanterns is also different, there are small and cheap ones, and there are quite large ones, which have 2-3-4 brown solar panels of amorphous calculator-type silicon on the lid and a nickel-metal hydride finger-board battery, usually 600 mAh. <br>  Here is their brightest and most intelligent representative of those that have been in my hands. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5e7/5ba/2f7/5e75ba2f7c0e6bea6e00eb990c13a27f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  As they say - "We must take!" <br><br>  The design allows both to install it on a peg in the box and hang it by the ring, 3 solar panels, a finger-type battery and a convex mirror reflector at the bottom of the ceiling.  Improvements are the same - sealing the lid, covering the board with varnish, silica gel and to taste - replacing the white-blue LED with a white or white-yellow LED for a more pleasing to the eyes of the spectrum.  It shines for a long time, it shines brightly, it looks beautiful, after revisions it serves for a long time, it is inexpensive. <br><br>  This is all that is worth knowing about solar garden lanterns to make the right choice and for a long time to use as lighting devices.  I used such big lanterns as table lamps and night lamps for two years and was pleased with the result.  Although if you are a collector and simply collect these devices for the soul - my advice will extend the life of your "pets." <br><br>  But the games ended when, as a result of a thunderstorm, a transformer burned out at the entrance to the village - the wires overwhelmed the wind and the protection failed.  In the village for a week there was no light - the electricians did not have a spare transformer and until they brought him, they had to wait.  A week without electricity, no MES, we were driven by a mobile diesel station - all the refrigerators melted, the incubators with eggs also ‚Äúcovered with a copper basin‚Äù, personally my damage resulted in about 20 thousand.  After such a ‚Äúpeck of a roasted rooster from the waist down‚Äù, I had to start building an autonomous energy system for such cases. <br><br>  As a result of analyzing the costs and benefits of different options, I stopped the photovoltaic.  And I will not hide - I was strongly motivated to embark on this path of my colleague ‚Äúpeling‚Äù, whose YouTube channel: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/SolFanify">www.youtube.com/user/SolFanify</a> and its website: <a href="https://peling.ru/">peling.ru</a> <br>  At first I watched his videos - quite affordable and fairly technical literate, then I read the forum of his site and publications about experiments with various devices related to alternative energy.  Along the way, in practice, taking up the construction of its first solar system, which is still alive despite the past 3 years. <br><br>  I started with the lowest possible and cheap configuration.  Two solar panels Exmork FSM-5P polycrystalline panels 12V 5 W, at that time they cost 900 r <a href="https://invertory.ru/">each</a> on the website <a href="https://invertory.ru/">invertory.ru</a> .  The PWR Solar 80 12 / 24V 80A charge controller with Ali is Chinese for 4 thousand rubles - on the controller I decided not to save immediately, it was painfully good according to reviews, a 12V 10 Ah battery from an uninterruptible power supply and a DC-AC converter 12-220V 150 W car purchased at the flea market a year earlier.  I had a battery and a converter, I bought the MS4 connectors and splitters, the wires were also of sufficient cross section and the whole system was out at that time - about 6-6,5 thousand per circle.  You will say - it is very expensive for a 10 W system!  And you will be right and wrong at the same time.  I still use the Solar 80 charge controller in my modern powerful system. <br><br>  I received my first 5 W solar panels ‚Äúwith adventures‚Äù.  They refused to send them to me by the Post of the Russian Federation and sent them to the TC PEC.  And they lost them.  When the delivery time has expired, and the goods were not tracked - I contacted the manager.  Which turned out to be a young Moscow girl, who began to fight off "from some kind of outside Moscow Ring Road", first in the correspondence by mail, and then by phone!  Even the threat of going to court did not help - the money was transferred, I had all the confirmations, but there was no goods!  It only helped to appeal to her superiors - I found the phone of the senior manager and called him, described the situation, sent the screenshots all the necessary and even recorded a conversation with an arrogant girl manager.  I did not even have to threaten with the court - the next day the panels were sent again with an apology and a request not to advertise what happened. <br><br>  Finally the panels were received, everything was connected and the system took on a practical look, only the battery was small. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d3d/e4c/44e/d3de4c44e7153bd31f77301a9de20bee.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In the photo - the further development of the system, the MonBat 170 Ah 12V AGM traction battery, the Solat 80 on the bench, 25 mm2 copper wires to the controller and outdoors - a pair of Singfo 100W 12V poly panels.  The panels were purchased on Ali with delivery from a warehouse in Russia and came out at 7,000 apiece.  At that time, Poli Inverters of FSM-100 W were delivered in small batches, most were bought up by dealers or wholesale buyers in advance, and the rest were swept away in minutes.  I had to buy Chinese and more expensive.  They sent them to the same TC PEK, without crates only in carton, but intact. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a17/d58/ac8/a17d58ac8bdb7199a2481e34b5e07af4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Those panels, on a self-made stand from laths 2040 at a wall of the house.  They are longer and narrower than 100 watts of the Exmork panel. <br><br>  But the photo of their stickers with the characteristics. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/963/5a4/680/9635a4680b67ac486cfc4e0bc07e86f3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The next iteration of the system was the purchase of an inverter at 12-220 V 1600 W.  For financial reasons, it was necessary to stop at the ‚Äúbeggarly version‚Äù of the company A-Electronics.  The Pure Sine DUALDSL-12-3000 UPS was purchased from 13 tr.  together with delivery. <br>  Here is his photo. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/89b/1cb/ace/89b1cbace5d4ac1fea587a203bde3016.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  This inverter is positioned as a bespereboynik for gas boilers and is able to work in the broadcast mode and charge the battery from the network, but it is also possible to work as an inverter for alternative energy.  As I actually used it.  The device is not the ultimate dream, but for its price it has a decent functionality and so far it still works after almost three years. <br><br>  Here is a photo of the connected inverter in the test version. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/98f/e29/2cb/98fe292cb1ddef38b0d692522015682d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It gives out its 1600 W, when a 1700 W oil heater is connected, the protection begins to squeak.  But so much I did not usually load it up to a kilowatt.  One 170 Ah battery in my personal experience is about 1 kW of stored power and is quite consistent with a pair of 100 watts of solar panels without undercharging or overcharging, and the 10 watt panels with the 10 Ah battery of the first test system are exactly the same.  Which is now with the Chinese PWR 30A charge controller for 500 r with dostvkoy "lives" in the hen house, providing autonomous illumination to chickens. <br><br>  A photo: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4b8/0cd/249/4b80cd2494d5d9ab569f8abe122deed6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Those same 5 watt panel, the rest is inside. <br><br>  Further, the system developed quantitatively, and then qualitatively. <br><br>  Batteries and solar panels were added, this time only Exmorc. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7e5/f61/550/7e5f61550dfe556ead4fca8e9e21039b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Here is a photo of their stickers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f23/54d/611/f2354d611982bf8b86f1dcf1790ea327.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  First, 4 to 100 watts to a pair of those that have already been, while I switched to a system of 24 volts.  Already two 170 Ah batteries were installed in series, the controller was reconfigured, the panels were re-connected and the DUALDSP-24-3000 was bought, which already quietly yields 2000 watts.  The second inverter turned out to be a little worse, noisier fans, but it works and suits me for my money. <br><br>  The next iteration of the expansion is 4 more panels of Exmorco 100 W poly, the 24 V system is the same.  Now all 8 Exmork panels look at noon, the first two look at sunset. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6bc/057/2e8/6bc0572e85981288b413774aaf369217.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  They add to the battery charge in the evening when the sun "goes around the corner of the house." <br>  In the final version, I have 12 panels, 10 Exmorc panels + 2 Singfo panels.  8 panels at noon, 4 at sunset, 2 batteries 170 Ah, PWR 80A charge controller and 2 kW inverter. <br><br>  Here is a video about my solar system: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/i78iaCJ4xQM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  The story about the system itself. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K2wZX_-1vDU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  The story about the elimination of the effects of the storm when the panel was blown away, breaking the stand and breaking the connectors MC4.  Fortunately, I have a stock. <br><br>  Future plans include increasing the number of batteries so that ‚Äú170 Ach per pair of 100 W panels each‚Äù and installation of 400 W of a Chinese wind turbine that has already been purchased, but the mast has not yet been made.  There is a lot of work, it is not for the panels of the racks of the stand to unscrew. <br><br>  I am satisfied with my system and the cost of it, too, given the regular blackouts in the village due to periodic accidents and some work on the lines.  I didn‚Äôt give a close to counting the exact return on investment, but thanks to the solar system that is actively used to power household appliances, I pay 500-600 r per month for electricity, while my neighbors have 2.5 thousand billboards for gas stoves.  If you count 2000 rubles a month in savings - the payback period already invested is about 5 years, 3 years have already passed.  And the main thing for me is that when there is no light in the village, I have it. <br><br>  At this point I will finish my story, I hope it was interesting and useful to readers.  Anyone who is interested - subscribe to my channel, there is the latest news and videos about my projects and reviews of interesting devices that can hardly be met in everyday life. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/455154/">https://habr.com/ru/post/455154/</a></p>
