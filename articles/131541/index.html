  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Wizee Shopping - transformation of consciousness</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Just over 4 months ago I <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/startup/121037/">wrote</a> about the project of my friends ‚ÄúWizee Shopping‚Äù, a mobile application that allows you to always have shopping mall cards at hand, be aware of promotions, discounts, shopping center events, memorize a parking place, see which of your friends is located in the shopping center, to find out the movie schedule to view the photographs of the collections ... Now the project team wants to share with the residents of the habr about what happened during these 4 months after the habra effect))) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/24368d47/8434c92d/c9d750d4/da5136af.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Our company is developing.  During the last publication on Habr√©, something has changed (for example, the application itself and our attitude to certain things), something is not (we still think that we can do better and more).  That's what we have today. <br><br>  We have added to the application almost everything that was promised.  For example: <br><ul><li>  Now you can see which friends of Facebook and Vkontakte are next to you in the shopping center, and also find out which shopping centers your friends go to when and in principle.  You can meet and shop together, you can just have fun shopping stalking - someone that is more to their liking. </li><li>  Using the application, you can view photos of collections of individual brands.  An indispensable thing when, for example, a girl drags you into the next ‚ÄúZara‚Äù - ‚Äújust to see‚Äù.  Poke her button in the smartphone, let him look, without leaving the food court. </li><li>  Recently, a schedule of film shows with a detailed description of films is available in the application. </li><li>  Improved design.  Smartphone users can appreciate such things. </li><li>  A number of small functions have been added, for example, selected discounts and shopping centers, keyword search, and overall performance has become better. </li></ul><br>  At the moment, 45 shopping centers in Moscow, St. Petersburg and Novosibirsk are available in Wizee. <br><br>  We actively cooperate with more than 80 brands that provide us with photographs of collections and any other information.

      And we made a video. <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/t6QW6ygBLHk%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhhQxu726xP9u17xHB2X39ZyyUeq0A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  But what are we all about Vaizi and Vaizi, and talking about myself is much more pleasant.  Now we will talk about how the work on Vaizi has changed us and our attitude towards certain things. <br><br><h1>  Users </h1><br>  When the application was just launched, we tried in every way to lure every passing person with an iPhone and an android into our application.  We thought that, on average, the most courageous members of the team on their way to and from work could find 2 people a day.  We have three brave ones.  Thus, it turns out 2 users * 30 days * 3 = 180 users per month.  Of course, we understood that 180 users per month is a bit.  However, for us it was our very first users - music for the ears of any startup. <br><br>  We recruited in public transport and on the street, in cafes and cinemas, in clubs and in libraries, even pestered in elevators and processed in doorways.  If earlier we chose girls with whom we would like to meet, because of prettiness, then at that time the glance slid over passers-by in search of a suitable handset.  We even learned to recognize the phone model by the face of a person! <br><br>  Today, the application downloads more people than we could for several months.  Therefore, it makes no sense to run through the streets for all the owners of iPhones and androids.  However, even now, if you understand that the application will be useful for a person, you want to take away his phone and quickly install Waiza there. <br><br><h1>  Recognizability </h1><br>  It also happens that you approach a person to tell about Wizee, and he shows you the application already installed in his phone.  Some even claim to actively use it. <br><br>  Once we (the development team) were even recognized in some Moscow cafe.  Perhaps the matter is that the word ‚ÄúWaisy‚Äù is too loud and often pronounced, but we still attribute this success to our own account. <br><br><h1>  Our comrades </h1><br>  Each of us tells friends and acquaintances what we do, and, of course, great demand from them.  If someone after the second reminder does not install the application, it is dead for us.  However, he can easily come to life by setting Wisey, but still they are not joking with such things.  If someone does not know how to install applications, we do it ourselves.  If someone does not have a suitable phone, we buy one for him. <br><br><h1>  User Reviews </h1><br>  During the existence of Wisey, we received about 500 reviews in the upstate and android market. <br>  The most critical in the App Store is: <br>  ‚ÄúIt is doubtful out of 100 [excellent] grades 4 fours and 1 triplets along with my 2 well, it doesn't happen that way‚Äù <br><br>  The most incomprehensible in the App Store: <br>  ‚ÄúOlychka, here I also wind myself up with this !!!  And if for him this means nothing ... I‚Äôll suffer again !!!  But from the fact that there is a possibility of intimacy with him does not leave me !!!  I want his step to the meeting !!!  If this happens, I will be in seventh heaven !!!  Only his step is needed ... at least a small one ... A modest little step like that !!!  Then I will do everything myself !!! "(this is about Vaisi, most likely) <br><br><h1>  application </h1><br>  I would also like to note how people's attitude towards our application has changed.  When we started working on Wisey, many people were skeptical about him - experts, investors, shops, shopping centers (in general, everything except users and relatives).  Like, the application will be useless - and so there are maps and navigators.  However, now the stores and shopping centers themselves ask us to add them to our application.  Experts and investors also lost the question of relevance.  What will happen next, will soon see. <br><br>  At last, it would be desirable to share information on a habraeffekt.  On the day of the article, the application downloaded over 1000 people. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/941240f0/379a6c26/1a251eba/f0ce8eb5.png"><br>  (DundasChart) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/131541/">https://habr.com/ru/post/131541/</a></p>
