Of course, it's fun to code, develop, or design a mega-service or start-up, but this requires powerful brain work. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/9cb/c44/db5/9cbc44db549b840db0c90529a8c6c365.jpg" width="377" height="384" alt="Powerful ASM Programmer Brain" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left"><br><br>  The athlete works with the body and the programmer with the head.  The whole team works on the athlete - a trainer, a nutritionist, a neuropathologist, a psychologist, etc. Does such a team work with programmers?  If you do not take Google into account, then usually the programmer is presented to himself and he has to work on himself on himself.  And this is despite the fact that the brain is busy with the project, new technologies, deadline, bugs and a bunch of other problems that require immediate resolution.  In addition, there are problems in your personal life that are not easily solved. <br>  One of the main tasks for any athlete is the ability to rest, especially when there is a match, a game, a battle - to use every opportunity for rest, as little as possible unnecessary movements to keep himself in a fighting state. <br>  A programmer, I think, should treat myself the same.  It would even be wonderful if people could get expert advice on rest and the daily routine.  The poorly developed skill of relaxation can lead to a variety of problems. <br><br>  Typical complaints: <br><ul><li>  I rest on vacation, but I only have a rest for a month, then again like a robot </li><li>  Frustrated not on the case of relatives and friends.  I can not force myself to do simple housework - clean up, wash the dishes. </li><li>  I avoid communication, it does not bring pleasure. </li><li>  It seems to work like an ox, and the results are insignificant. </li></ul>

      What to do, how to be?  If you have similar problems, then the most correct would be to contact a neuropathologist.  He will assess the depth of the problem and prescribe treatment.  If everything is started, then you may need a long rest and taking various medications, including  antidepressants.  Excellent assistance in this matter has a rest in specialized clinics in the German Alps.  Silence, tranquility treats many mental illnesses.  Many writers and poets loved to rest there.  <a href="http://health.mpei.ac.ru/sindrom.htm">Burnout</a> sufferers - welcome! <br><br>  But I would like to dwell on the hygiene of mental labor.  How to work with your head and always be cheerful, contented and happy! <br><br><h3>  My thoughts are my horses </h3><br>  First of all, you need to pay attention to what is going on in your head. <br><br>  The fact is that the human brain consists of cells that have a charge and which transmit it to each other during mental activity. <br><br>  Many devils in my head that are going on.  Thoughts appear to induce noise, they are clogged by others who do not understand where they are from.  A person constantly thinks about something, analyzes something, reflects on something - and so on all day and even in the evening.  As a result, the cell charge is depleted and a powerful feeling of fatigue rolls around.  Also disturbed sleep.  For example, it is impossible to fall asleep because you think and think about something.  You wake up in the middle of the night.  Even when you eat, you think about any garbage, for example, how fun it is to implement 3D in Fallout. <br><br>  This must be fought with two methods. <br><br><h4>  Rest from thoughts </h4><br>  Those who practice yoga will quickly grab.  For a rest, meditation is needed.  For those who do not know what meditation is, I will describe a simple exercise. <br><br>  In a room in which it is calm and quiet and no one will interfere (turn off mobile phones and turn off the computer) we lie down on a comfortable bed.  The body is straight, arms at the seams, the muscles are relaxed.  We are trying not to think about anything, but to feel calm and serenity.  Bams, the first sassy thought appears.  Imagine in the head of such a powerful blunt guard 2x2, which blocks the thought and broadcasts to her "Goodbye!" And then sends it out of your quiet, serene head.  So you need to get rid of all thoughts and soon you will learn to do it with a simple volitional effort, without a guard, thereby plunging into meditation.  Focus on peace and tranquility in your head. <br><br>  So then you can meditate even on the bus, but the best thing to do is in some beautiful, pleasant place.  Find it yourself! <br><br><h4>  Prevention </h4><br>  Now in the work, enter control over thoughts.  Excess - away.  You are engaged in the code - think about the code, and not about Masha, friends in ICQ, vain roommate.  Eat in the dining room - think about food.  Less extra, repeated as a plate, weed thoughts.  This is the same meditation, only on a specific case. <br><br><h3>  Information Society and Plyushkin </h3><br>  Nowadays it is necessary to process a huge amount of information, which, as we know, Cthulhu generates (at 21:00 on the First).  A large amount of brain resources is spent on its digestion, but do you need it?  If you have a free minute, you do not need to spend it on reading Habr, Dirt, Tapes (take special time for this), but rather drink a tea with a cookie.  Some come home from work watching TV or sitting in the internet - a bad way to rest.  You are still loading your brain (more suitable "litter") weed load, which leads only to fatigue and does not bring anything useful.  Do you have Wasserman or an idol, I want to ask?  "I want to know everything" - you do not need this, I am sure. <br><br><h3>  Fiz-ra in the fresh air </h3><br>  If you do not make at least 30 minute walking tours a day, then you are waiting for bad news.  In general, first solve the problems described above.  Because exercise also strains the brain, and if you have brain strain, neurasthenia, then exercise will be superfluous, take up meditation.  However, meditation can also be combined with exercise, if the brain is not very tired.  Running, lifting heavy rods, cycling through the woods will drive away all extraneous thoughts (three more circles, damn, I won‚Äôt run one, let's run body-machine).  By the way, it is necessary to burn fat from the abdomen only in the open air (in the hall it is inefficient). <br>  Charging in the morning (or riding to the office on a bike, as I do) makes a sleepy slug, a vigorous bull.  Putin is doing daily pen and hour exercises.  All because then you have to sit on the chair for 8 hours, and this is unnatural.  By the way, you should not sit on a chair for more than 40 minutes.  You need to get up and walk for 5-10 minutes. <br>  In addition, physical education (you don‚Äôt need sports, you also like to program) teaches you to live, develops useful personal qualities, personality itself, confidence, a beneficial effect on the psyche as a whole. <br>  It is necessary to make the movement a part of your life, so that at your sight this would be immediately obvious, and not that you drink a lot of beer on weekends.  Health and clean energy will come immediately. <br><br><h3>  Do not disturb the diet </h3><br>  That's it!  Some megamena save on lunch.  Better sell your organs right away!  But seriously, everything should be done gradually.  Therefore, to achieve high results, do it regularly.  Regularly run, regularly go out into nature, eat regularly, sleep regularly.  It is desirable to do all this also in due time, but not so today at 12, tomorrow at 14. Remember that everything in this world is subject to RHYTHM. <br>  Sleep is very important.  No wonder they say - sleep heals.  That is, its effect on the body is very extensive and it is not worth saving.  They say that Artemy Lebedev sleeps 11 hours a day.  In this case, Donald Trump assures that it is enough for him to five.  First of all, you need to determine how much is enough for you and sleep enough.  Lack of sleep is the surest path to degradation in physical and mental abilities.  You may be able to build your regime in such a way that it will take less time to sleep, perhaps with age people sleep less - this is individual and is established through experimentation. <br><br><h3>  be happy </h3><br>  Another and final aspect of a good holiday is pleasant emotions.  Nothing prevents you from being happy and happy right now (I hope).  Do nice things for yourself, do not be too strict with yourself and do not expect anything from yourself and others.  Accept yourself and others as they are.  Love yourself and women.  Do not try to take a loan for a car when you already have one.  Thing - who needs it.  Remember that the main thing in life is beauty and desire! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/30006/">https://habr.com/ru/post/30006/</a></p>
