The second novelty is "explosive" in nature - this is <a href="http://go.veeam.com/endpoint-ru">Veeam Endpoint Backup FREE</a> , a free tool for backing up data from <u>physical</u> machines - laptops and desktops - based on Windows.

      What else will be remembered for the first conference for administrators of virtual infrastructures?  While the memories are fresh, and the jet-lag does not let go (the 11-hour time difference is still not a joke), I will give you a reportage from the scene and try to convey the atmosphere of the event. <br><br>  Follow the White Rabbit! <br><br>  <i>I apologize in advance for the quality of the photos in this post - most of them are shot on camera in the phone and not suitable for glossy covers.</i>  <i>A beautiful photo report can be viewed <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/%3Fset%3Da.10152829219960799.1073741889.48046820798%26type%3D1">in the group on Facebook</a> .</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Three days of the conference in the chic Cosmopolitan Hotel are best described by the buzz, the modern English word - several floors of the hotel looked like a beehive with green bees.  Guests and organizers with all sorts of attributes of green color scurried through the corridors, flowed from conference rooms to the exhibition complex, gathered in the halls with cups of coffee, talked, shared impressions, exchanged experiences, and made business contacts. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/189/099/97c/18909997c5ea41b99a2bb984411dd9e5.JPG" alt="image" width="320"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2ae/4e5/c6b/2ae4e5c6b4e64922920c2ffded878cb4.JPG" alt="image" width="320"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/108/dea/1f9/108dea1f9ab2498285a04d9703271990.JPG" alt="image" width="320"><br><br>  ‚ÄúFollow me‚Äù - with such signs, we, people-signs, met VeeamON guests in the lobby of the Cosmopolitan hotel in order to simplify navigation and speed up their movement to the hall where the session was held.  In total, more than 55 technical and business sessions took place, and some of them were held twice - the halls could not accommodate everyone.  Many presentations were held in collaboration with Veeam customers, who shared practical experiences with the audience on data recovery and backup infrastructure organization based on Veeam solutions.  In my opinion, such an emphasis on practice and real-life stories became a qualitative difference in VeeamON sessions.  By the way, restoring a data center in less than 15 minutes is not just beautiful words from our site, but a real result, which one of the customers cited as an example, speaking at a session on replication strategies and automatic transfer to backup copies of data. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/87b/bc2/77f/87bbc277fd1a403c8e2e985b22da599e.JPG" width="320"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8ed/e1b/e55/8ede1be550f74d46b02889123899e0cc.jpg" width="320"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/950/468/3ce/9504683cee204bd3949328f8ed50f15e.jpg" width="320"><br><br>  Starting from the first day, in parallel with the sessions in the main hall, it was possible to observe focused people at the monitors - these were the participants of the ‚Äútitan battle‚Äù of LabWarz competing by solving the proposed scenarios of tasks for the implementation and use of Veeam products on the end-user side.  The winner, Ideen Jahanshahi from the USA, was solemnly awarded the title of ‚ÄúThe Best Veeam Engineer in the World‚Äù and presented a well-deserved reward of $ 10,000 (I wonder if he went to the casino later?) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/af3/204/892/af32048923d64eeba7f5269c0dc2f9a3.JPG" width="480"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c38/875/001/c3887500128642e2badf3e394dbbae35.jpg" width="480"><br><br>  With difficulty, waking up after the super-mega-party Veeam ("work hard, party hard", if you know what I mean), hosted in one of the nightclubs of Vegas ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/75f/cfb/8d2/75fcfb8d2b4e423bbb6eee6c1392f9fa.jpg" width="320"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/39a/12c/8fd/39a12c8fda8f4d0fa07cebcff522b981.jpg" width="320"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/91b/f4f/603/91bf4f603b51470399957fe5729b13a8.jpg" width="320"><br><br>  ... Early in the morning, with a group of <s>survivors of the</s> most persistent and curious, we grabbed cups of coffee and went on a tour to <a href="http://www.cobaltdatacenters.com/technology/cheyenne-specs/">Coalt's Cheyenne</a> , a modern data center that provides server rental services (co-location) and located almost in the desert.  The contrast in comparison with the usual average Russian server was amazing: seven levels of access to the data center, perfect pharmacy cleanliness, cool N + 2 HVAC ventilation and air conditioning and power up to 6.7 kW per 1 sq. M.  However, I do not know how the rest of the tourists, and I was most impressed by the generator.  A cube is built under the open sky, there is a door in the cube, there is no ceiling - the sun is shining.  On the platform in the center of the cube is a large metal container;  open the door - there is something gigantic, complex, green and 7.5 MW.  It was not possible to refrain from asking the data center owner: ‚ÄúIs this a time machine?‚Äù <br>  I was strictly forbidden to photograph there ‚Äî I am posting the only photographs that the severe censorship missed: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/26f/7f1/044/26f7f104479240c1aaced6b75949048a.jpg" width="400"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/316/e48/ce3/316e48ce32db4d6ea8b9ea95ae4de9d0.jpg" width="300"><br><br>  For dessert, all the guests and participants of VeeamON were given a brilliant performance by the charismatic <a href="https://twitter.com/alexisohanian">Alexis Ohanian</a> , co-founder of <a href="http://www.reddit.com/">reddit</a> .  The story of the rapid development of reddit from an unknown startup to one of the most popular sites on the Internet involuntarily caused an association with the story of Veeam, which for 8 years has gone from <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/veeam/blog/187388/">three desktops</a> to a billion-dollar company. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/256/6ce/320/2566ce32028a48049536aae9a331a8fa.jpg" width="600"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b35/4c3/d2e/b354c3d2ec6346d5be3c46222b8b5307.jpg" height="347"><br><br>  Instead of concluding, I will say that no photos or stories can still convey the main thing that VeeamON will remember - the warm atmosphere of the event and the openness of people to communicate.  Outside of this story, there will be a huge amount of interesting conversations between partners, customers, Veeam employees - conference participants, as well as jokes, exchanging opinions and discussing hundreds of topics from organizing a Hyper-V infrastructure to the optimal <s>blackjack</s> strategy <s>for</s> building a data center in your company. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/241157/">https://habr.com/ru/post/241157/</a></p>
