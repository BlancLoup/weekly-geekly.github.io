Did I have a medical examination?  Definitely yes, although I don‚Äôt remember this, but this is not a reason not to pay 1,400 rubles for such a ‚Äúservice‚Äù to the state to the medical institution.

It turned out that it was a bad idea to use our own ES (issued, of course, by the accredited Ministry of Communications TC) when signing the declaration.  As a result, one of my declarations with the attached files did not "pass", because  The attached files were somehow crookedly signed.  I had to delete my ES from the office, ‚Äúgenerate‚Äù ES from the FTS, with saving to their servers (securno, yes) and after that the declaration was sent to me without problems and registered with the FTS also without problems.  But in the end, time is still lost, because the FTS, by law, reviews declarations for no more than 3 months.  So with each re-sending of the corrected declaration, the term begins to be re-considered.  By the way, one of my declarations just disappeared, and when I sent it again I received a message that such a declaration already exists, although it is not displayed in my account.  It was necessary to indicate the correction number in order to resubmit the declaration.  In general, the quest for the return of a couple of kopecks eats so much time that it would be easier to earn this money at the weekend, carrying Yandex.Edu. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Need more declarations!</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-2/se/wp/-2sewpajomji8ojnvgenj2jhoyg.png"><br></div></div><br><a name="02"></a><h1>  <b>Getting a second passport</b> </h1><br>  You can also <a href="https://www.gosuslugi.ru/10051/1">apply online for a second passport</a> , edit the photo for 2 hours, and then come to the MFC and find out that the required window is open until 17:00 and only on weekdays.  Perhaps this is the most useful service, because  allows you to get at least something tangible, while at the time of registration online you can <a href="https://www.gosuslugi.ru/10005">save</a> 1,500 rubles by <a href="">spending 3,500 rubles instead of 5,000</a> if paid through public services.  Of course, collecting information for an international passport is a whole story.  In particular, it is necessary to indicate all your places of work / study for the last 10 years, addresses of institutions and so on.  Doing it at home is still easier than sitting somewhere else.  In fairness, it is worth noting that on August 18 (Saturday) I submitted an application, on August 21 (Tuesday) I received an invitation to take photographs, took a photo, on September 5 I received a notification about sending a passport to the seal in the State Sign, and on September 10 I arrived and received it.  Thus, the passport was made within 24 calendar days, or in terms of working days - 15 working days. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Case closed, colleague!</b>  <b class="spoiler_title">(c)</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/s3/8f/df/s38fdfpplvavybnidumpgud4dee.png"><br></div></div><br><a name="03"></a><h1></h1><h1>  <b>Getting an extract from the Unified State Register of Real Estate (USRN)</b> </h1><br>  You can get an extract from the USRN (information about your apartment / house / cottage), for your own 300 rubles, and then google for half a day how to open the data, and open it, find out why the picture is not displayed with the layout.  The history with this system is generally beautiful - to get an extract from the Unified State Register of Real Estate (USRN) about your house / apartment / cottage, you need to select your property in <a href="https://lk.rosreestr.ru/">the Rosreestr personal account</a> (authorization through State Services) and create a request for the necessary data.  Payment occurs through some strange intermediaries, which you can choose.  In general, it is opaque and not userferndli, but as it is.  After payment, the electronic certificate was ready in a couple of days (to collect information in the packages, too, because the work), after which a surprise will be waiting for you: you will be given to download a zip archive, which will contain: folder ‚Äú1‚Äù, * xml file and the disconnected electronic signature in * xml.sig format.  But how to view an honestly paid statement?  It is necessary to upload the received xml file and the disconnected signature on the <a href="https://rosreestr.ru/wps/portal/cc_vizualisation">special</a> Rosreestra <a href="https://rosreestr.ru/wps/portal/cc_vizualisation">page</a> , enter the captcha, after which the service, or rather the ‚Äúservice‚Äù, will offer a link, I quote, ‚ÄúShow in human readable format‚Äù.  The human-readable format turns out to be quite human, but not very readable - the apartment plan is <a href="">not loaded</a> .  It turns out that it is necessary to save the html-page that opens after clicking the button ‚ÄúShow in human readable format‚Äù -&gt; Save to the root of the response-xxxxx folder, which Rosreestr gave to download.  And only after that it will be possible to read this unfortunate statement relatively calmly, but the picture in it is still on such a scale that you can‚Äôt see anything on it, so it‚Äôs better to open the picture separately, at least in the same Paint. <br>  PS You can get very scarce, but free, information in Rosreestre by <a href="https://rosreestr.ru/wps/portal/online_request">reference</a> , if you know, for example, the cadastral number.  But the information is so scarce that it is almost useless. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Screenshot from Rosreestr personal account</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/uf/rc/z0/ufrcz0qz5pd9empgvgjns_l-3ua.png"><br></div></div><br><a name="04"></a><h1></h1><h1>  <b>Information from the GIS system of housing and communal services about the house and services from the management company</b> </h1><br>  You can try to get information from the <a href="https://dom.gosuslugi.ru/">GIS utilities</a> about your home, utilities services, etc.  Alas, for the residents of Moscow, the portal‚Äôs functionality is almost inaccessible, so if someone from the supported regions from the supported regions can tell and show that the portal is able - write in the comments. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Screenshot from personal account GIS utilities</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/3x/t6/c6/3xt6c6pftkgjta0_9un7ea6ffpc.png"><br></div></div><br><a name="05"></a><h1></h1><h1>  <b>Getting a credit history</b> </h1><br>  It is possible to get free of charge 2 credit histories per year from each credit bureau (even if you did not take loans!) In which your file is kept.  From the <a href="https://www.gosuslugi.ru/329476/2">link,</a> you can find out in which credit bureau your history is stored, so that later you can request your history through the personal account of a specific credit bureau.  It is necessary to dwell on this service, since  it is divided into 2 stages: you need to understand in what (what) credit bureau your history is stored, and when they found out in which bureau it is stored - send there a request for the provision of your credit history.  Earlier, before adopting amendments to the law on credit histories, it was necessary to somehow find out your ‚Äúcode of the subject of credit history‚Äù (I never found it), then through the <a href="https://www.cbr.ru/ckki/">website of the</a> Central Bank to find out in which credit bureau your history is kept , then on the website of this bureau, if it supported online requests, request your credit history.  Now, thanks to the amendments made to the ‚ÄúFederal Law of December 30, 2004 N 218-‚Äú On Credit Histories ‚Äù(article 13), there is a technical opportunity to receive information on the State Bureau in which credit bureaus are kept, after which register on the bureau's website, or log in through the State Services and get your credit history. <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> It turns out, according to <a href="http://www.consultant.ru/document/cons_doc_LAW_51043/602f589cb0d8d7b7127f3446189d6e399778eabb/">clause 2, article 8, FZ of 12/30/2004 N 218-FZ (as amended on 08/03/2018) ‚ÄúOn Credit Histories‚Äù (as amended and added, entered into force on 01/31/2019)</a> You can legally receive <b>from each bureau</b> in which your credit file keeps your credit history <b>2 times a year for free</b> .  For some reason I thought that in principle I can only order my credit history free of charge twice a year.  So, if the credit history is kept in 3 bureaus, then you can request your history 6 times a year for free.  Initially, I indicated in this post that no more than two credit histories per year can be obtained free of charge regardless of how many bureaus it is stored.  This information turned out to be incorrect, I apologize. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.consultant.ru/document/cons_doc_LAW_51043/602f589cb0d8d7b7127f3446189d6e399778eabb/">Clause 2 of Article 8 of the Federal Law "On Credit Histories":</a> <br><blockquote>  2. <b>The subject of credit history has the right to each credit bureau in which the credit history is kept about it, no more than twice a year (but no more than once on paper) free of charge</b> and any number of times for a fee without giving reasons to get a credit report on its credit history, including the individual rating of the subject of the credit history (if any), including information accumulated in accordance with this Federal Law on the sources of credit history and credit history users who  ydavalis credit reports. </blockquote><br>  An interesting moment - in Russia there is the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259D%25D0%25B0%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25B1%25D1%258E%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE_%25D0%25BA%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D1%2585_%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9">largest</a> Russian bureau of credit histories called the <a href="https://www.nbki.ru/">National Bureau of Credit Histories</a> .  Having studied almost the entire site, I still did not find how to enter a private office as an individual.  As a result, thanks to devious ways, through forums-chat-correspondence, thanks to <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/slash_id/" class="user_link">SLASH_id,</a> I found the <a href="https://person.nbki.ru/">person.nbki.ru</a> link through which you can create a personal account, and already through it request your credit history.  By the way, there is an opportunity for ~ 700 rubles to request your credit history at Sberbank and Tinkoff Bank, but at Tinkoff (for 60 rubles) it is slightly more than completely useless - there are no details, and at Sberbank it is more complete than at Tinkoff, but still does not reach the full-fledged report that gives the credit bureaus. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">An example of the information received about the place of storage of credit history</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bs/xv/ko/bsxvkodi3vuuw5dzl7q0d8yxgym.png"><br></div></div><br><a name="06"></a><h1></h1><h1>  <b>Information about retirement savings and work experience</b> </h1><br>  Get information about your retirement savings, as well as about the number of points thanks to which you can live a healthy retirement, full of new impressions, you can live your life either on the State Services <a href="https://www.gosuslugi.ru/10042/1">link</a> or on the <a href="https://es.pfrf.ru/">website of the</a> Pension Fund of Russia in my head?).  This service is quite informative, because  allows you to understand which employer made contributions to the fund, and who did not.

Separately, it is worth noting the portal <a href="https://gorod.mos.ru/">Our city</a> (only for Moscow, apparently) - it is through it that you can report a particular problem (broken stop, fallen trees, inscriptions in transitions, etc.) and get a surprisingly quick solution to the problem, and the result of the corrections is often quite normal (although it is not complete without the work done by the hoo-man). <br><br>  However, in spite of the carriage and the small carriage of shortcomings associated with the implementation of certain State services, some basic, but often used, public services work quite correctly and conveniently.  But the rest of the services, unfortunately, are either not translated into electronic form, or for one reason or another are not usable for the average computer user (which is an example of an extract from the USRN).  It would be interesting to hear how public services are developing in the regions outside the Moscow Ring Road, because  in Moscow, the situation is not as bad as I suspect. <br><br>  PS In the new version of the State Services, alas, it is impossible to check the validity of the EA, or to check the legitimacy of the file with the ES disconnected.
