And it does not matter at all what it is about - a similar classification is found almost everywhere, from telephones and other equipment, to automobiles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/506/44d/a27/50644da27d2025da5beabd2d6396604e.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  However, the market credibility of some companies allows you to add to the above-mentioned segmentation another item - <b>exclusive</b> ( <a href="http://bit.ly/igZVfq">VIP</a> , IT, 31337).  Outstanding performance here is not the most important thing, the main thing - the price tag is higher and the label "limited edition".  Otherwise, it could be anything - a photoframe with briants, an even more meaningless bauble, but autographed by a well-known design studio or a sofa made of leather from the president of some small country (or even big).  Everyone puts their own meaning in it, supporters and opponents of this issue will again distort themselves, however, there is always a buyer for such things. <br><br>  For several years of my review activity, I had to deal with everything except the sofa - trying not to dwell on any one topic, I wrote about the low and hi-end, I used the mainstream, I breathed in premium fluids ... Perhaps, thanks to this variety, I it's all still interesting.  Okay, not the point - I never did it with introductions)

      Today, on my best-looking desk, there was an unusual netbook from a well-known company to you) What makes it unusual?  Yes, as a matter of fact, a netbook is like a netbook - a screen, a keyboard, connectors ... everything is just like that of people.  Just released it ... no, wait, wait a minute, grumble) In general, it was released jointly with another equally well-known company producing sports supercars ... well, today I will share my three-day experience using the netbook <b>ASUS VX6 Lamborghini</b> .  Looking ahead - there are no precious tsatsek in it and the price is quite adequate, so you can continue to read ... nevertheless, let's greet the new flagship netbook.  For the mood you can watch (in HD, with sound) <a href="http://bit.ly/gjAwKH">this</a> video. <table><tbody><tr><td> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/630/04b/382/63004b3824642f220cdbc839867e4101.jpg" align="left" alt="image"></a>  <b>Automobili Lamborghini SpA</b> (briefly: Lamborghini - correctly read ‚ÄúLamborghini‚Äù, erroneously - ‚ÄúLamborghini‚Äù) - an Italian company, manufacturer of expensive sports cars and gas equipment;  located in the village of Sant'Agata Bolognese, near Bologna.  The company was founded in 1962 by <b>Ferruccio Lamborghini</b> (Ferraccio Lamborghini) (1916‚Äì1993) as a subsidiary of its tractor factory Lamborghini Trattori SpA Lamborghini cars are one of the most powerful, expensive and exclusive vehicles of serial assembly. <br></td></tr></tbody></table>  Once I was asked to write specifications at the very beginning of the article.  Done <br><br><h2>  Specifications of ASUS VX6 Lamborghini </h2><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/45c/0e8/820/45c0e882021b8e35863fcb8ba3069b32.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Processor:</b> <a href="http://ark.intel.com/Product.aspx%3Fid%3D49490">Intel¬Æ Atom ‚Ñ¢ D525</a> (two cores, 1.83 GHz, 1MB L2, 45nm, TDP 13W, Intel¬Æ 64) <br>  <b>Chipset:</b> Intel¬Æ NM10 <br>  <b>Graphics subsystem:</b> NVIDIA Optimus: (IPG) Intel¬Æ GMA 3150 + (GPU) Next Generation NVIDIA¬Æ ION ‚Ñ¢ (N11M-PT2) with 512MB of GDDR3 memory <br>  <b>RAM:</b> 4 GB DDR3 800, 2xSO-DIMM <br>  <b>Data storage:</b> hard disk (250 GB / 320 GB) + 500 GB ASUS WebStorage <br>  <b>Operating system:</b> Windows 7 Home Premium <br>  <b>Display:</b> 12.1 ", 1366x768, with LED backlight <br>  <b>Connectors:</b> 1xVGA, 1xHDMI, 1xRJ-45, 2xUSB 3.0, 1xUSB 2.0 (with the function of recharging external devices when the netbook is off), 2 audio jacks <br>  <b>Wireless interfaces:</b> Bluetooth 3.0, 802.11b / g / n <br>  <b>Card reader:</b> MMC / SD (SDXC) <br>  <b>Camera:</b> 1.3MP <br>  <b>Speakers:</b> Stereo, Bang &amp; Olufsen ICEpower¬Æ + Sonic Master Premium <br>  <b>Battery:</b> Li-Ion (6 cells, 4400 or 5200mAh), battery life up to 7 hours <br>  <b>Dimensions:</b> 297x204x29 mm <br>  <b>Weight:</b> 1.45 kg <br><br><h2>  Equipment </h2><br>  It all starts with a black box of matte cardboard, on which are glossy inscriptions of both brands - about the same intriguing beginning was my old man <b><a href="http://bit.ly/dO3RUY">EeePC 1002HA</a></b> , which still serves me faithfully. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/36d/e9d/352/36de9d3525d4b3c79a787a9060e5d03a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The box opens like a small case - there is even a special ribbon so that the top of the lid does not open more than necessary.  From this point on, it begins to smell deliciously with freshly packed iron - such as those moved like me, it warms no worse than mulled wine) I am aware that this is just a package, however, it looks at least presentable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/70a/11f/e78/70a11fe78d00f6ba7611b9a13de10a2b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  But, unfortunately, the joy was not complete - except for a netbook in the box there was absolutely nothing) No, of course there were charging, power cord, instruction, battery ... but no additional accessories - not a mouse, nor a fashionable key fob, nor even a case!  But if they were included, the price probably would have been very heavy.  But in general, for the VX-series there are original and quite interesting accessories - mice, covers, bags and backpacks ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e4a/555/567/e4a555567c51ba7d76c0c27e489c2a5b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b49/803/238/b498032388a3cd1a6edeae8e5cf04479.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The network adapter is quite small - exactly the same as in all the company's recent netbooks.  Accordingly, the power plug remained unchanged - it is all the same dead "needle", which, if it is careless, can very quickly become unusable.  Subjective disadvantage, s. <br><table><tbody><tr><td>  Ferruccio Lamborghini was a big fan of sports cars, in particular, Ferrari.  He noted that the clutch of these cars was similar to what Ferruccio used in his tractors, but was distinguished by low reliability.  That is why he criticized Enzo Ferrari (the founder of Ferrari).  Ferruccio was greatly shocked by Enzo‚Äôs statement that "the tractor manufacturer has no right to criticize such cars."  Offended, he set about trying to create a better Ferrari than Ferrari‚Äôs. <br>  To this end, in 1963, he founded his Automobili Ferruccio Lamborghini SpA factory near the Ferrari factory and invited his former Ferrari engineers, Gianpaolo Dallara and Bob Wallace, to work. <br></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>  Appearance </h2><br>  It is simple, but at the same time elegant.  The case comes in two colors - white (ID Code = <b>1A</b> ) and black ( <b>1B</b> ).  I got exactly the dark model, although, of course, I wanted a white one - as practice shows, the light body is much less easily soiled;  black really was very susceptible to prints. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/817/259/b6b/817259b6b120b20f3e362156b8180aa1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ae4/f49/e7a/ae4f49e7a9817845372837df747a0691.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b62/9a8/5ef/b629a85ef4cadaaef719f9b99ed5fd32.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The relief of the "hood" is very distinctive and recognizable - if you google it, there really is something in common with the <b>Lamborghini Murcielago LP640</b> ... for example, an emblem with a bullhead) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3f4/f66/67c/3f4f6667ccb9f79e98d1bc1f68268621.jpg" alt="image"><br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/abf/e4b/65c/abfe4b65cf361bd2e9d4be8c20eea4b6.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><table><tbody><tr><td>  Born under the sign of the calf, Ferruccio Lamborghini adorned the company logo with a bull.  By the way, Gallardo (Spanish brave, courageous) is one of the famous breeds of fighting bulls. <br></td></tr></tbody></table>  The layout of the elements is identical to the model 1215N - on the left there is a network connector, VGA and HDMI, one USB (2.0), air vents and a memory card slot with support for the SDXC format. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bc1/f3d/6f7/bc1f3d6f735d0b6b064c125c58d9ad76.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the right - two audio, two USB 3.0, RJ-45 for 100 Mbps and a hole for the anti-theft lock. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d61/4ad/19c/d614ad19c966ded67b949e9ed635b6f3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  There is nothing behind, in front there are a couple of LEDs that are not visible when working, which means they will not be annoying with their light (it is not even clear why the CapsLock LED is there). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b3e/47b/e7a/b3e47be7a9fd095366cccc18a28f732f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the reverse side are two massive rubber legs and two smaller ones near the battery compartment.  I had a model with a lithium-ion battery (model A32-1015, compatible with vx6xxx, 1015xxxxx 1016xxxxx and 1215xxxxx) at 5200mAh (+ 10.95V, 56Wh) with it the netbook seems somewhat thick ... although there is a less capacious option (4200mAh ) - it may be more compact.  The weight of the device with battery is 1.45 kg.  Among other things, on the bottom of the netbook there are two speakers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0ca/a9b/862/0caa9b862252b09d641301b4672255b6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b41/76d/e1c/b4176de1c53b45987cbf31051d78fc2e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I open the lid.  I see materials that are very uncharacteristic for a netbook - the case itself is aluminum, which can be felt in a pleasantly cool way.  Inside the aluminum is a black matte insert from a material that is very similar to a soft touch.  There are exactly the same matte inserts under the keyboard - it's great that you don‚Äôt have to tear off the factory stickers, since all the stickers are on protective shipping films) a couple of movements and here it is, beauty! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7d7/649/18c/7d764918ce0b9e180672a9d91a76e0fa.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/73b/f78/4a2/73bf784a2654ada2137062445bfeb598.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The keyboard is exactly the same as in 1215N, the only difference is that the VX6 has a matte underneath the buttons, and the metal case itself gives it additional strength, thanks to which there are no clangings during fast typing (I, by the way, began to master the ten-finger method - I decided that This is a useful skill.  To appreciate the convenience of the keyboard, I try to print at least a little on it, and not just press a couple of keys.  So, more than half of this article was written on an unusual layout for me - this is how I wrote down the main points in the course of using the device.  And the layout, by the way, turned out to be very convenient!  It has two large Shift keys (with no duplicate slash to the left), large Enter, Backspace and Tab.  And most importantly, there are no tricks with arrows - the most common arrows, the location of which we are all used to.  The English letters are white, the Russians are sea green, and the FN functions are blue.  The key illumination would be very useful. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/19d/1c2/fda/19d1c2fda827b1cbfcb4867c817410b8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The touchpad is framed with a metal frame and is no longer highlighted in any way.  As in the previous model of the VX-series, these are stylish ceramic buttons, cool ... but otherwise the touchpad ... not, it‚Äôs not that bad at all, it‚Äôs even multi-touch) But it‚Äôs awfully awesome!  Another of its features is that the working surface is somewhat smaller than the physical dimensions of the touch panel;  It does not cause any inconvenience, but this logic is incomprehensible to me.  In general, the touchpad is quite responsive and it is pleasant to use it.  The touch panel is shifted slightly to the left relative to the center of the case. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c29/738/436/c29738436b469a535e991669bfbb3540.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Above the screen is a beautifully styled 1.3 megapixel webcam.  <a href="">An example of the image</a> in low light conditions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bad/822/329/bad822329469e3e9e620e31025d87a09.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The camera has a rubberized insert, thanks to which it is somewhat easier to open the laptop + there are no prints left. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/327/15a/4d2/32715a4d2f0a7cc9ad7aca60823a13c7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/277/33e/34b/27733e34bdaedce05a45dfb589ca4703.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  Netbook work </h2><br>  On the netbook, Windows Home Premium is preinstalled - it takes about 20-25 seconds (without optimization) until it is fully loaded from the moment you press the power button.  In addition to the WHP, the device is pre-installed with the Linux distribution of <b><a href="http://bit.ly/9ZgyUn">ASUS ExpressGate</a></b> (an exclusive OS from ASUS, which provides quick access to the network and key applications without loading Windows), to download which has a corresponding button on the case (it manages performance profiles in Windows).  While working, it glows with unobtrusive white light: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/191/1ba/3ac/1911ba3aca8e2f0578b613f956da99b1.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  It is noteworthy that when you start from the audio system of the netbook, the fervent sound of the Lambo motor is heard - at first it is very remarkable, but, I think, it can get annoying over time.  If desired, the sound can be turned off in the BIOS (in the same place its volume can be adjusted).  Another surprise was that at the very beginning of the download, the screen displays a high-quality and full-color emblem of the car, while even in the most expensive laptops and motherboards pixel bitmaps are still used. <br>  Few people know that after pressing the F9 key from the hidden disk partition on most new netbook-laptops from ASUS during the bootup, you can restore the guaranteed OS distribution with the factory settings.  But even fewer people know that backup can be done the same way on an external USB flash drive or disk. <br><br>  On the desktop, all shortcuts are more than standard - as always there is a lot of excess among them (well, or unnecessary).  Dark wallpapers with sports cars and the corresponding screensaver - besides this there are no program differences from the same 1215N. <br><br>  Honestly, I didn‚Äôt have time to test everything entirely, play toys ... But overall performance will surprise anyone - the dual-core <a href="http://ark.intel.com/Product.aspx%3Fid%3D49490">Intel¬Æ Atom ‚Ñ¢ D525 processor</a> paired with a discrete video adapter gives the once-primitive device class really great possibilities, which are on ordinary 10 ' '' netbooks never happened.  FullHD-video goes without problems (this is true if you output video to a large panel via HDMI, the wires for which are not normally put in the package), you can play many modern toys (of course, not at maximum).  The resolution of 1366x768 allows you to work comfortably in the same photoshop. <br><br>  Filling and performance in numbers: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/386/8a4/fdd/3868a4fdd05335cf5d6c437367d9858c.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/682/562/7e6/6825627e602fbe75a8fc583cf3f38bd1.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d7a/744/5db/d7a7445dbdd738fa69710c526e6a134b.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/621/40f/0a3/62140f0a35e132548b8e301c38886572.png" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/049/4e8/477/0494e847732c0bb0e047e5a9507771a4.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/870/8fe/3a1/8708fe3a161f3e59a6bd47de7d66751c.png" alt="image"><br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bc4/a86/be2/bc4a86be26470d0cb39ed69ea2a841e5.png" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8e0/b30/571/8e0b30571f2210fb50a5a176c9089a0e.png" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9bb/434/d8a/9bb434d8a899947b98ee7def3a8b49dd.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  The system index is <a href="">3.2</a> .  At maximum speeds, the netbook in the PCMark05 test scored a little less than 2400 points, and in the synthetic 3DMark06 - 2550 on the default settings.  More details about performance can be found in this video: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/_guKHCTZxDA%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700043,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjjCbTLkZ2eSGar2CelxNmLYsAL3g" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  To whom a little - <a href="http://bit.ly/ffI2IR">here is a link</a> to a truly professional review.  He is so meticulous that if you can handle English, then there will simply be no questions left. <table><tbody><tr><td>  After an oil crisis, in 1978 the company declared itself bankrupt - an Italian court was forced to sell the company.  It was bought by brothers Mimram from Switzerland.  A little later, the company was bought by <b>Chrysler</b> , at the time when work was done on a follower of the Countach - Lamborghini Diablo.  Considerable technical and financial resources were involved in the modernization of the company and the cars produced, and the end result was another success - very quickly the Diablo model brought the company to the world level again. <br>  In 1994, Chrysler, due to financial difficulties, was forced to sell the company Lamborghini to an investment group from Indonesia <b>M'tec</b> (Megatech).  For the same reason (financial problems), the company changed its owner again in 1998, this time <b>Audi AG</b> became the new owner. </td></tr></tbody></table>  On the video, it is difficult to assess the sound quality - it's like advertising high-definition video on a regular TV screen :) However, ICE Power and certification from Bang &amp; Olufsen, as practice has shown (using the N and NX series of laptops as an example), is not just an inscription.  Here, the sound may not be ambitious (as in the <b><a href="http://bit.ly/dR3E4z">ASUS NX90</a></b> , in which there is a similar technology ASUS Sonic Master Premium), but anything better than budget netbooks! <br><br>  In the Furmark test, the GPU temperature did not exceed 65 degrees, while the processor warmed up to 76-78.  Nevertheless, the device continued to work and made it fairly quiet.  The case itself was almost not heated - the temperature mode changed only at the keyboard, on the left side, where hot air is blown out.  The lower part of the case is slightly warmer, but completely uncritical - if you put the netbook on its feet, then you can play or watch movies without any problems. <br><br>  The battery life will depend on the battery capacity and operating conditions.  At maximum brightness in the load mode, the netbook works just over 3.5 hours, while the minimum brightness and the Wi-Fi module turned off allows you to stretch the pleasure for more than 6 hours. <br><br>  Useful pleasant trifle - <b>USB Charge +</b> function for USB 2.0 connector.  As it is not difficult to guess, it allows you to charge the connected external devices, even when the netbook itself is turned off - many people can, but even when it is not plugged into an outlet.  As far as I know, this is no longer found in any other company's netbook. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/305/1d1/1b2/3051d11b2e39333ee3aee36521070b33.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/af2/94a/228/af294a2281f2c106ec7aac2f877a8602.png" alt="image">  Check weighing </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/881/117/ccb/881117ccbc836c685868fb19a2bf46c1.png" alt="+">  Appearance is beautiful, non-standard materials <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/881/117/ccb/881117ccbc836c685868fb19a2bf46c1.png" alt="+">  High-quality assembly, body partially metallic <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/881/117/ccb/881117ccbc836c685868fb19a2bf46c1.png" alt="+">  Screen diagonal 12 '', comfortable resolution 1366x768 <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/881/117/ccb/881117ccbc836c685868fb19a2bf46c1.png" alt="+">  Convenient keyboard, while printing, the case under it does not bend <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/881/117/ccb/881117ccbc836c685868fb19a2bf46c1.png" alt="+">  Very quiet operation, even in load mode;  the case is almost not heated <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/881/117/ccb/881117ccbc836c685868fb19a2bf46c1.png" alt="+">  Opportunities enough for all tasks prescribed netbooks <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/881/117/ccb/881117ccbc836c685868fb19a2bf46c1.png" alt="+">  HDMI, two USB3.0, USB Charge +, Bluetooth 3.0, Wi-Fi n, excellent Bang &amp; Olufsen acoustics, 1.3MP camera <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/881/117/ccb/881117ccbc836c685868fb19a2bf46c1.png" alt="+">  High enough battery life <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/24f/0ae/920/24f0ae920b085ead2e6d649649177122.png" alt="-">  It seems to be premium, and no grade <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/24f/0ae/920/24f0ae920b085ead2e6d649649177122.png" alt="-">  Thin power plug - subjectively at risk <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/24f/0ae/920/24f0ae920b085ead2e6d649649177122.png" alt="-">  Glossy screen, frame and touchpad;  the cover too but there it is not so scary <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/24f/0ae/920/24f0ae920b085ead2e6d649649177122.png" alt="-">  Not very big display brightness;  the screen "goes blind" in the sun;  small viewing angles <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/24f/0ae/920/24f0ae920b085ead2e6d649649177122.png" alt="-">  RJ-45 only 100mbit;  not enough keyboard backlight <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/24f/0ae/920/24f0ae920b085ead2e6d649649177122.png" alt="-">  High price (from 27,000 rubles) <br><br>  As you may have noticed, I periodically experiment with the format of articles (have ideas? Write!).  In the germ there is such an element as ‚ÄúA glance from the side‚Äù - most likely it will be small independent opinions from people ‚Äúin the subject‚Äù.  I didn‚Äôt prepare for this time, but <b>Igor Makienko</b> prepared something - he wasn‚Äôt registered with Habr√©, but that didn‚Äôt stop him from becoming one of the first owners of the white VX6 - we discussed this model with him a lot, argued and eventually made a lot of useful contribution to my article.  His own thoughts and all-all-all about the netbook, he quite interestingly laid out almost a <a href="http://besho.narod.ru/reviews/eeepcvx6/white.doc">separate article</a> <a href="http://besho.narod.ru/reviews/eeepcvx6/white.doc"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/711/8c9/73b/7118c973b888c5c34ebf0da077cacded.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/90a/e01/b9d/90ae01b9dabb055249ab9cad35023040.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  Buy it!  ) </h2><br>  Night, outside the window of the rain <s>bangs on in the twilight gray shadow</s> , I finish this article, but I am hampered by the feeling of deja vu.  I remember very well the moment when ASUS presented its first netbook to the general public (it was an EeePC 701 with a screen diagonal of 7 '') - truly IT residents of Habrahabr orgasm was literally, and the site itself was filled with a bunch of topics about discussions, all kinds of life hacking and other experiments with the new machine.  Some phones cost two to three times more expensive - indeed, a full-fledged ‚Äútypewriter‚Äù with a price of 9999 rubles was available to virtually everyone and very soon became ‚Äúpopular‚Äù.  However, the snobs were right - the line between the netbook and the <s>combine</s> ‚Äújust a small laptop‚Äù was erased quickly enough, with the growth of the diagonal and the appearance of other buns the price grew - as a result we have what we have.  Such a course of development was then suggested in the comments and, in fact, this is exactly what happened ... although there is nothing surprising, everything is predictable.  On the other hand, why not make a premium segment in netbooks) <table><tbody><tr><td>  <b>Deja vu</b> ?  (fr. deja vu - already seen) - a strange garbage mental state in which a person feels that he once was in a similar situation, but this feeling is not associated with a certain point in the past, but refers to "the past in general."  The opposite term <b>jameisu</b> (jamais vu) is never seen;  a state when a person in a familiar environment feels that he has never been here.  There is also deja vecu (‚Äúalready experienced‚Äù), deja entendu (‚Äúalready heard‚Äù). </td></tr></tbody></table>  ‚Äú <i>Burum, help a netbook to choose?</i>  <i>I type texts, check mail, ICQ there ... well, movies sometimes are primitive toys.</i>  <i>I am up to 15 thousand desirable ... well, or 20 - the ceiling, but it‚Äôs better if something is cheaper</i> ‚Äù- almost daily in my life (especially with the advent of twitter) dialogues began to emerge, starting with a similar phrase.  In this case, I have a universal answer (in which there is no model name), which, oddly enough, suits many :), but this is not about me now.  Indeed, netbook manufacturers slowly but surely sneaked to this ‚Äúpsychological edge‚Äù of users to give ‚Äú15-20 thousand‚Äù (precisely for a netbook; for laptops such a bar is slightly higher, 25-30) - most models lie in this range, and its limits are only the best.  Probably, because of this habit, the price of 28 thousand for the VX6 seems to be incredible, especially in the regions.  But, in fact ... the price is quite adequate, isn't it?  If you remember how much the first models of the VX-series (and similar ones from a competitor) cost, it becomes obvious that marketing is slowly coming down from heaven to earth.  No offense will be said, but the same Vaio P or Galaxy Tab seems to me a lot more unjustified investment of funds - yes, they are compact, but unlike them, "traditional" netbooks give much more ... these ... as their ... possibilities, in. <br><br>  <b>ASUS VX6 Lamborghini</b> is an image model, which by its characteristics is very similar to the previous leader <b><a href="http://bit.ly/eee1215n">ASUS EeePC 1215N</a></b> (the price of which lies in the range of 20-25 thousand).  Accordingly, the overpayment of 3-8 thousand in the VX6 is not only for the wallpaper and screensaver: increased the amount of RAM to 4GB, guaranteed Wi-Fi n and two USB3.0 ports (another 2.0 with USB Charge +), 1.3 megapixel camera, much a higher quality Bang &amp; Olufsen certified audio system, a partially metal body with a stylish design and, of course, the label itself.  Such an investment will only alienate you from the Italian car industry, because this money could be deferred to buy a new Diablo or even Reventon;) However, the Chinese Harley Davidson jacket and the toilet water of the same name will not make the owner closer to the legendary motorcycle.  Eh, why not release devices with the same BMW?  After all, it would be more close to the people - nevertheless, sports cars on our roads are not so often found even in Moscow. <br>  In general, an exceptionally elegant device turned out - as elsewhere, there are flaws in it, but at the moment it is the only netbook that I would like, despite the fact that I am quite indifferent to Lamborghini.  It seems to me that the device is worth it ... well, or it will be worth it.) You have to get a discount from the asus, buy a matte film on the screen and frame, a 128 gigov SSD disk (which would fly) - to hell with the family budget, but your birthday will be soon!  ) But on hand there will be a universal miniature assistant who will always be pleasing to the eye. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5c7/17c/e4d/5c717ce4d02d28454be51bf41950eb2a.jpg" alt="image"><br> <i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The very first picture is taken from the site </font></font><a href="http://www.notebookcheck.net/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">www.notebookcheck.net</font></font></a></i> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> * Motor sound *</font></font></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/108906/">https://habr.com/ru/post/108906/</a></p>
