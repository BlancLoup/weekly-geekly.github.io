Where robotized systems produce the bulk of goods and services, and people, all possessing high self-awareness, are engaged in family, increase their knowledge in different directions, move deeper and deeper into space and study the Universe, travel.  I want to live in technocommunism.  So I want, that already decided to actually achieve this.  I am sure that we can touch this bright future, feel its achievements in the coming years.  We can, if we strain our ass so that it will be possible to sharpen knives about them.  But at the same time, we must rest, cultivate.  Is it possible to combine all this, not to demand from people to die heroically and at the same time to achieve?  With a properly built system of life this is possible.  As a result of 12 years of my research of life, practical tests, various work, throwing myself into all sorts of "death zones", etc., today I see such a way of clarity that I have never seen before.  At the same time, I am not a ‚Äúguru with divine revelation,‚Äù so I don‚Äôt know the magic phrase that will change your life, but I know magical actions that change life - to work, to achieve, <s>not to go to work forge</s> . <br><br>  This article is a reflection and a story about what technocommunism is as a social formation, and what I do to achieve this goal is described in the article I publish simultaneously with this, but on Habr√©, article on the <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/303124/">worldwide automated system "Technocommunism"</a> .

      I want to warn everyone at once: the way of building a bright future offered by me is experimental in everything and has not yet been run in on any civilization I know.  There are no interplanetary GOSTs yet.  Even more, I am acting without a license from the galactic council for the construction of a bright future.  And now, when everyone is completely convinced that I am really crazy, you can continue. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Part 1 (what is he talking about? Not exactly about the elections?)</b> <br><br>  Let's start with the name of the bright future ‚Äútechnocommunism‚Äù that I use.  Why not technocracy or something else?  In short, it is simply because from the perspective of how I see a bright future, namely: universal social equality, automated production systems everywhere, and they belong to the entire working people, people did not fully withdraw from labor and did not become pure energy, the institute was preserved families, etc.  - this is all, according to the dictionary, is called technocommunism, that's why I call it so. <br><br>  Here is a video presentation with common words about technocommunism.  It has dynamic music and lyrics flying at hyper speed through the stars.  If you set the playback speed to 0.5, then instead of dynamic music you get interesting meditative music. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/HWGTNjSmJoM%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiGUyRM0VR9um-HNoZ1N0rOR8Lc5g" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  As it should be clear from the video presentation, this is not about elections <s>to the assembly for cutting the budget</s> , not about political parties, but talking about creating a new system of interaction between people, achieving new public formation, through extra-political mechanisms.  Someone here can reproach me, say that there is no change in the world without elections, parties <s>and other ways to steal money from people</s> , and I will answer that even the classics of Marxism-Leninism and history itself have confirmed that the "election" does not establish the power of the working people.  In previous times, this issue was solved by revolutions with the deaths of different numbers of people, but this time we will try to do with the technical revolution.  I will write more in detail separately, based on my experience I will answer a bunch of ‚Äútricky‚Äù questions like ‚ÄúWhat makes you think that they won‚Äôt break your legs or head,‚Äù etc.  For now, let's just establish that as part of our current experiment to create a brighter future, we decided not to kill anyone, and send the oligarchs and their minions to reeducation in the taiga to cut and re-plant the forest (nature needs to be cherished), after re-education (and science will help to re-educate) all will become full participants in our bright future.  No, I am not a snotty romantic who rarely goes out, my life is very full, including blows to my head, but this is not a reason to give up on people, this is the motivation to change the world for the better. <br><br>  <b>Part 2 (why and who needs it?)</b> <br><br>  My motivation to change the world for the better is built on two pillars.  First: I do not want to just live, I want to achieve the highest, the most important thing that will give people eternal or almost eternal life, and as I said, as a result of more than 12 years of research on this issue, I am sure that this is technocommunism.  Secondly, but no less important: my son is 11 months old, I want so much that he doesn‚Äôt have to plunge into shit as many times in my life as I can (it is possible to temper iron will in other ways), and my wife has a headache that we reduced to minimum size, but she regularly tries to grow again.  My parents are no longer young, although they are fine, including financially, but this is achieved by the fact that my father (‚Äúsysadmin‚Äù of combat aircraft), for example, performs tasks in Syria, and even when he does not work in such extreme conditions, it is all the same he (and his mother often together with him) have to travel to different cities of Russia and the Soviet space, which is given more and more difficult every year.  I have worked all my life, working hard, trying to find ways to act even more efficiently, but now I have no choice.  Do not rush to scold me, saying that you would not suffer from the garbage about the future, but to hurt the loot.  I'm talking about the fact that the right way to technocommunism does not require you to give up everything, to sacrifice yourself and your loved ones - this is a delusion.  The true path to technocommunism helps a person to live here and now.  Only 100% acceptance of reality makes it possible to act as efficiently as possible.  Every step towards technocommunism should make people's lives better, then it is based on reality, then it is effective.  See below for a list of materials that I plan to write; in them and other materials I will reveal this question in detail and show the effectiveness of the technocommunist way, its benefit for everyone here and now. <br><br>  I have to remind you once more of what the world is like now.  While we are talking here, people are now rotting there without simple medical care, and this is not somewhere in Africa, but there are many people in the Soviet Union who don‚Äôt have free time and free resources.  So, too, should not be!  Giktayms is a place for developed, smart people, so I am sure that you understand all this without me.  I want to live in a bright future, I repeat: I want the whole of humanity to unite in order to preserve the main value - human life. <br><br>  There is no system built around us, living in which we save our precious lives as much as possible, around us there is a system that every minute strives to shorten our lives.  You do not want to be so?  I am sure that you have unrealized ideas that could help people live better.  The system of organization of human society should contribute to the realization of the potential of every human being himself. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8f5/a56/5d1/8f5a565d1fe44996beeae9524d690b06.jpg" width="560"><br><br>  <b>Part 3 (who and how beats for technocommunism?)</b> <br><br>  In fact, if you dig around here and there, many projects are moving towards this goal by someone understanding, someone not understanding or even denying.  For example, among the supporters of the <b>project is Venus</b> , which is known as a merely a technocratic project, proclaiming that humanity does not need any general ideology, just machines will do, and people will live and live according to plan (and what then is this plan if not ideology? ), so, even among the supporters of the project there are many people who call themselves communists / technocommunists.  In general, as a point 0, the Venus project can also be attributed to the technocommunist project, where people are not given unnecessary details so as not to cause unnecessary disputes.  I spoke with Stan, one of the project managers, the coordinator for the Russian-speaking region (living in Florida, USA), he says that you can't just call yourself a follower of the Venus project, there is a Plan, the Plan is complicated, you need to study it for a long time, but everything is ... just some kind of holy book. <br><br>  As for the study of the Plan, the Venus project coordinator for Moscow, studied it and, for example, told me that he had come to the conclusion that Jacques Fresco was in favor of preserving the traditional biological family, and the people from the United States, where appropriate propaganda is carried out by corporations that want more and more money, studied the same thing and came to the conclusion that Jacques Fresco is building future for everyone, and since the ‚Äúfamily‚Äù of 3 men and a cow is normal, it means Jacques Fresco approves of it.  And Jacques Fresco himself, whom I treat with great respect, tries to speak in general phrases, because he did not want to destroy his life‚Äôs work before he died (March 13, 2016, he was 100 years old), but when he was many decades ago Out of the best of intentions, it seemed that the Venus project was based on slogans like ‚ÄúIdeology is not needed,‚Äù ‚ÄúCommunism is just an ideology, and Venus has a clear plan,‚Äù etc., he couldn‚Äôt even dream about this ideology of the preserving basis of human civilization in the United States and  Many other countries will be victorious marches marching people with different sexual disorders, dressed in genitals and raising money for an operation to sew themselves genitals of both sexes, because it is fashionable this season, this is written in a magazine. <br><br>  And in order to complete the project of Venus, I will now write a phrase that unfortunately offends some of the project‚Äôs followers, and some agree with me, say that they themselves see it or guess, I don‚Äôt want to offend anyone, what I‚Äôll say is not the result propaganda of "Putin's media", and the result of my study of the project in Russia.  Well, as I see, foreign funds (by whom they are funded, whether they are funded by governments and special services, I don‚Äôt know, I did not see their financial documents) use the Venus project in Russia for destructive activity against Russia.  First of all, it is aimed at the development of the idea ‚ÄúAll resources of humanity are common‚Äù - this is a rational idea and in the future, it will certainly be implemented on the basis of fair principles in the interests of all mankind, but now this idea is presented as that in the West everything is smart, develop high technology, and we are stupid here, so we need to give everything clever, they will dispose of according to the mind.  Jacques Fresco says that no one will be able to use the Venus project as their weapon, because reason will win.  But, unfortunately, this is a delusion, in a world where the right to be reasonable for a little more time and the <s>tickets</s> will be given permission, the mind loses money.  This is a big topic for a separate article. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/130/167/5af/1301675af78e41cda9b1173dd7f44153.jpg" width="560"><br><br>  In addition to the above-mentioned project, Venus, about which I have written so much deservedly, but which, as I said, in my opinion is mistaken in some fundamental things, I will limit myself to the list of those who are currently creating the most activity in techno-communism in Russia, although this is only a small part of the world technocommunist movement: <br><br>  1. The first item to mention is the <b>World Automated System ‚ÄúTechnocommunism‚Äù</b> , whose task is to integrate the entire technosphere of mankind into a single system.  The EAS of Technocommunism is administered by the Council of Technocommunism, in which I am also, whose task is to develop all this, both from the technical side, and to develop and introduce various socially useful projects and initiatives.  More about everything in the already mentioned <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/303124/">article on Habr√©</a> .  As part of the information work, at the moment we have enough resources to post relevant news on space exploration on our portal, and we started creating video materials and other ‚Äúpleasant looking‚Äù materials.  As part of the plan to overcome the disorganization of the Soviet Union, we are reviving Soviet television, how we can help the development of the trade union movement and people's enterprises (where more than 75% of the shares belong to the workers themselves), we are preparing a project for the high-tech city of New Leningrad (I plan to write a whole series of articles for Hiktimes) and etc. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/113/f6f/068/113f6f0686f14141a5e02945ba54d39c.jpg" width="560"><br><br>  2. <b>Technocommunist club "Impulse"</b> .  Through their groups and the site are engaged in active education on the theme of communism / technocommunism, innovative technologies.  In the Russian-speaking space, at the moment, perhaps, the leaders of the information struggle for technocommunism.  Information work is built not just on fantastic pictures about the future, it is based on the Marxist-Leninist pivot, that is, there is no gap between communism and its development - technocommunism, which is certainly correct, otherwise another technocratic project is obtained without a deep scientific and philosophical base, and therefore and weak ideologically, therefore, weak in its basis, not having the strength to fight for its development and development on a global scale. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7f9/676/b7d/7f9676b7dc8c4327bd22f73e76de5799.jpg" width="560"><br><br>  3. <b>Technocommunist Party</b> .  Just recently, the party was created by people.  I was constantly asked a question about why I didn‚Äôt create such a part, because the sonorous name, it seems like a promising and all that.  I have long explained to everyone that the most effective way is different, through bringing people together in a single automated system that best implements the various needs of people, providing various useful services, etc.  Other people decided differently as a communist, I have no right to condemn them, any work is important, therefore I wish them success in their work.  Moreover, as a result of this work, they, for example, have made such a good video on the subject of technocommunism.  Against such moments, glimpsed there as a cyborgization of a person, I object, but otherwise beautiful.  I will add that the party holds the right actions on the topic of popularizing space exploration, popularizing the best Soviet developments, etc. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/6TkoFet8PaM%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiyoFPWK1bp7M1rc6oF1M0C4TeEIQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Also separately, like the Venus project, you should definitely mention another project that does not speak out loud the word "technocommunism", but it brings closer - this is the <b>project "USSR-2061"</b> dedicated to "the future you want to live."  I think that this is a very good idea - to direct the creative potential of people to imagine what the revived Soviet Union will be after overcoming temporary disorganization, and as a result of this work clearly show what magnificence, what level of civilization we are now deprived of, so that people more and more often thought about it and embarked on the right path.  Within the framework of the USSR-2061 project, regular competitions are held about the Soviet Union of the future, about the people of the future, in various genres: graphics, prose, poetry. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/011/b56/164/011b56164acc4c3a9391afcb8652c0c9.jpg" width="560"><br><br>  All of us, members of the three above-mentioned technocommunist associations, are familiar through our accounts in social networks, but have never communicated with each other, including not having been rewritten.  We just know that we all are.  I don‚Äôt know what drives all the others, but I‚Äôm functional to this - everyone does their part of the whole business, why waste time on idle chatter.  But it seems that conditions are created in order to think about how to direct our resources to any one ‚Äúpoint of power‚Äù, after a while it is worth inviting each other to coordinate <s>with the snack</s> . <br><br>  <b>Part 4 (what's next?)</b> <br><br>  In short, this is the world of technocommunism, and such processes are now taking place in it, in general terms.  I realize that sometimes, without further explanation, I use categorical statements like ‚Äúthe right way‚Äù, ‚Äúthis is a fallacy‚Äù, etc.  I do it based on my vision of the world, based on the fact that I, a man who, at 5-6 years old, together with his mother, ‚Äúfinished‚Äù the University of Marxism-Leninism, where he learned that humanity has great goals and man of work is and then all the years until today (I am 32 now), as far as possible, improved my knowledge and skills in the field of building a new world and live a great dream, some things seem to be very clear.  But I understand that other people may have a different set of knowledge, a different interpretation of them.  Let's not waste time arguing.  Who sees the future differently, write about it in a separate material, look for your like-minded people and as a result of labor and evolutionary processes, everything will fall into place.  I am looking for more like me.  And you, comrade, one of us? <br><br>  I will make this article a table of contents for all related materials that have already been written or will be written in the near future, while the list is as follows: <br><br>  - <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/296344/">The path to a brighter future.</a>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/296344/">Creating and automating a trade union, why do we need a trade union, and where does Cambodia</a> ; <br>  - <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/303124/">Worldwide automated system "Technocommunism"</a> ; <br>  - About how I marked the thresholds of Habr, Mile, OnliOfisa and the hallway In the Circle of Friends; <br>  - We will unite with you and create the largest IT company - a national enterprise; <br>  - Experimental methods of creating trade unions or how to wrap bigbos and not die; <br>  - High-tech city of New Leningrad. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/372361/">https://habr.com/ru/post/372361/</a></p>
