All fun Friday afternoon and the same fun evening.  One idea came and I wanted to think.  I am not a mathematician and not a cosmologist, so let them take it as a frivolous Friday post. <br><br>  And so ... Imagine a ball.  Submitted.  He has a center.  Let's call it CENTER TOTAL (CV).  Imagine a sphere (the surface of this ball).  Let's call it SPACE.  And so on the sphere we have space.  Somewhere there we are.  Somewhere there is the sun and other galaxies.  All of them live in a plane three-dimensional space on the plane of a sphere.  But for us it is not particularly important.  For us, this is the plane of the ball. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      Imagine the volume of the ball - let's call it TIME.  Those.  TIME flies from the point of CV in all directions, while setting the expansion of space (the plane of the sphere) in all directions with a certain rate of expansion.  The age of our universe is the radius of the ball R. <br><br>  The ball is constantly increasing (inflated), while increasing the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe sphere.  And here we are standing on the plane of the sphere and the time as the layers near the bulb overlap one another. <br><br>  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe sphere depends on the radius according to the formula: S = 4 * pi * (R ^ 2).  With a huge R of the ball, and a small size of a piece of area, we can approximately assume that the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe sphere is a square.  But since the square on the plane of the sphere represents a cube in our three-dimensional space, the conclusion suggests itself that the rate of expansion of space is constantly increasing (since the dependence on the radius (TIME) is quadratical). <br><br>  If it‚Äôs a long time to proclaim it ... then some conclusions suggest themselves. <br><br>  <b>Why nothing can move faster than the speed of light (faster than the speed of expansion of the sphere)?</b> <br><br>  Let Csf is the rate of expansion of the sphere, X, Y, Z are the motion vectors in our three-dimensional space.  Togad SSF = Xmax + Ymax + Zmax. <br>  Those.  to fly with the speed of expansion of the sphere, you must fly with a maximum speed in all directions at the same time!  But we always move more or less towards one of the vectors.  Our X + Y + Z will always be less than Csf.  Only electromagnetic waves propagate in all directions with maximum speed, reaching the SSF. <br><br>  Another approach is to imagine a point that moves on a sphere faster than the speed of expansion of a sphere.  But our two-dimensional sphere has no center of expansion!  Those.  moving with the speed of expansion of the sphere, the point on the one hand will move twice as fast as the SSF, but on the other hand it will stand still and become the center of the expansion of the sphere ... It's good that today is Friday. <br><br>  <b>Light as a coordinate system</b> <br>  Let's now forget all that was said above and consider the model in which the light is a coordinate system.  What is light is a photon.  Wikipedia tells us that a photon is a massless particle.  Imagine now that the photon is not tied to our sphere and the ball, and is located as if by itself.  Those.  A photon is part of a four-dimensional coordinate system with a center in CV. <br><br>  And so ... Let there be a point on the sphere - our sun, for example.  Take two points in time T1 and T2.  Now presenting the light as a coordinate system, what will happen to the light between points T1 and T2.  More precisely, even so - how to change the position of the sun in our coordinate system relative to the photon?  And it will change as follows: <br>  1) It moves, as it were, up along the radius R (time) as the ball expands <br>  2) And in some direction on the plane of the sphere with the speed of expansion of the sphere Csf <br><br>  Catch the connection?  Those.  light (coordinate system) relative to the sun will remain in the past. <br>  Since any point on the plane of the sphere is also the center of expansion, in our three-dimensional world we see that the light from the sun radiates in all directions at the same time and ... is carried away into the past relative to us.  <b>But in fact, we are carried away from the light into the future!</b> <br><br>  Such reflections suggest that the absolute speed of light is not at all constant, since the expansion speed of the sphere increases with time, increasing the speed of movement relative to the coordinate system (photons for example) <br><br>  <b>So why can not you turn back the clock?</b> <br><br>  Let's agree that when we move in this space-time, the movement is divided into two vectors: <br>  1) In space (on the sphere) - the vector Csf <br>  2) And in time towards the CENTER OF TOTAL - the vector Cr <br><br>  And we cannot choose which vector to move us.  Those.  when we move, we move simultaneously on the plane of the sphere and in its volume. <br><br>  Sobs = Ssf + Cr. <br><br>  What does this look like in our ball model?  Moving fast enough, we begin to dive deep into the ball, as the magnitude of the vector Cr becomes more and more. <br><br>  As a result, the moment will come when we will fly almost down to the CENTER OF ALL.  Moving deep into the ball, we will fall on the inner layers of our bulb, where space is compressed relative to the previous point in time (as the radius of the ball becomes smaller). <br><br>  To keep up with the light, we will need to hang in our coordinate system at one point.  In space and time.  Become a coordinate system.  But as mentioned above, moving in a plane in our three-dimensional world, we cannot reach maximum speed on the plane of the sphere.  We will constantly be demolished in some direction on the sphere.  And in order to rush straight down to the TF, we need to reduce to zero the Cf vector. <br><br>  If we could reach the speed of light (hang at one point of the coordinate system), in order to move even faster, we would have to increase the speed vector Cr even more, but for this we need to increase the Cf vector.  <b>But we no longer have the space as we move vertically down to CV!</b>  <b>We have nowhere to increase speed.</b> <br><br>  <b>Gravity, black holes, time travel ...</b> <br><br>  A black hole can be imagined as an object that is attracted to CV and creates a distortion of the space-faith.  It looks like a hollow on the surface of the ball.  Moving towards the black hole, our decomposition of the velocity Sobs = Csf + Cr shifts towards Cr.  That is why it seems to a third-party owner that we slow down in space, it‚Äôs just that our Ssf is getting smaller and smaller as it approaches the center of the depression.  If we suppose that the gravity of a black hole is so strong that it is able to penetrate a depression into the CV, then in the end we will have to get into the moment of the origin of the universe.  In singularity.  Which is, according to some sources, the center of a super-massive black hole. <br><br>  All with friday! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/372101/">https://habr.com/ru/post/372101/</a></p>
