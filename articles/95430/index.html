Success in life largely depends on them, they influence the attitude of other people towards you.  This article is about voice. <br>  Agree that owning a good voice is a very important and useful property of a person.  The voice we use more often soap, food and women.  It fills our whole life, it is used always and everywhere.  Voice is one of the most important means of interaction.  But the voice is not perfect, it tends to deteriorate.  But unlike the burnt dumplings, it is quite possible to restore it and improve it.  This article is an introduction to this topic, and in addition to theory, you will find practical exercises here. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Blah blah blah </h4><br>  There are a lot of textbooks as well as a huge number of courses based on these textbooks.  If you are interested in this topic, I recommend to take special courses where a trained person will teach you more diligently, which will have a greater effect.  In books, too, a good option, many Soviet publications on the formulation of a voice are more credible than courses of unknown companies.  Also, the voice is not put for a week, and not for a month.  For a long time it will be necessary to perform the same exercises, which is inappropriate to do in the courses.  Courses are more needed to give a foundation.  Of course there are places where pros will lead you from start to finish, but this is expensive. <br>  This article, although not a professional tool, will completely satisfy the love of many people to <s>download the press</s> through the Internet to learn something without much investment. <br>  I want to write a series of articles if the topic will be in demand, therefore, your feedback will be needed. <br>  This chapter is about ... <br><br><h4>  Your loud, comprehensive and destructive voice </h4><br>  Surely you met people who speak loudly, their voice fills the entire room, hampers movement and causes respect (pun). <br>  And just as often, you have seen people who grumble under their breath, who have to ask again what they said, who put themselves below the interlocutor in a voice.  A clear day, it is better to strive for the first type described. <br>  By nature, every person has a loud voice.  Now we remember how the children on the street shout when they play, how everyone is silenced when the kids cry.  Convinced <br>  But with age, due to a number of reasons, this beautiful property leaves us.  A person with a spoiled voice can shout a child, but only because of the large lungs, and the trained muscles that will enhance the sound.  But the time the child can not do.  And the overstrained muscles will hurt.  The fact is that the air from the lungs of a child goes without resistance than an adult. <br><br>  Analogy: <br>  You put in the apartment a new crane.  The water flows smoothly, everything is cool.  But over time, the filter may clog, and the water will already not run perfectly smoothly, but, like me, on the one hand. <br>  In the human body, over time, such a thing as the <i>diaphragm</i> begins to act up.  In a child, it does not block the exit of air, so the sound is clear and strong.

    <h4>  In search of the diaphragm </h4><br>  Put your hand on the place where the ribs begin to diverge, so that part of the palm rests on the ribs, part - on a soft puzechka (also known as the solar plexus). <br>  Well, you found everything too quickly, and this item could be finished.  But we want to know some more valuable things about the diaphragm, right? <br>  Solar Plexus, SID.  Do you remember?  Beats in this part are painful, and most importantly, they knock your breath.  Something is remembered, great.  We have already gotten close. <br>  The diaphragm is like the air center of our body.  On the diagram, it is signed third from the bottom. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6b9/a41/0a2/6b9a410a299c2fb2a5d9a376775c5e25.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Put your hand back and stretch the sound "Rr-rr."  Vibrations that you feel occur in the diaphragm.  Now we know for sure that we have found it. <br>  If you have ever watched movies with all sorts of karate, or even engaged in a struggle close to the east, then you faced such a ritual when an athlete stands with his back straight, then presses his hands to himself and at the same time holding his stomach, very loudly yelling.  I repeat that the films are German, but with karate. <br>  When the belly pulls up - the diaphragm pushes the air.  Therefore, when they beat their breaths, a loud and strong exhalation occurs. <br>  If you didn‚Äôt practice your voice before, then by 90% you can be sure that while you were reading up to this point, you didn‚Äôt work with your stomach while breathing in and out. <br>  From the foregoing, it became clear to us that the diaphragm affects the strength of our voice.  It now remains to make her work for us. <br><br><h4>  Practice </h4><br>  No spread.  Some more theory.  By virtue, again, of vital reasons, our voice is strained.  He needs to relax.  When you are relaxed - the voice flows like a little river rumbles. <br>  The extremely pleasant thing that at least once in life every person felt - yawning. <br>  It gives us pleasure, not worse than the German kin, but in the process it acts on relaxation.  Try yawn. <br><br>  <i>Warning: if someone is with you, then there is a chance of a chain reaction.</i>  <i>That's the way to bring pleasure to the wireless way.</i> <br><br>  Well, yawned?  You have to yawn as good as you are yawning before you turn off the alarm clock with satisfaction and sleep through everything. <br>  Maybe it wasn‚Äôt possible to yawn well.  Probably ‚Äúso-so, it was better for me‚Äù.  To yawn so that pride has taken, follow these steps. <br>  Lie back in your chair.  Relax.  Relax your jaw.  Spend time just relaxing, all the following actions will occur as a result of relaxing the muscles of the throat.  Do not lower a head down.  The lower jaw drops, the mouth slightly opens.  The tongue stays lying backwards, it should move closer to the base.  A kind of shiver ran through her throat.  And help yourself a little by pulling the upper lip inward.  In!  The yawn went.  Probably now turned out too so-so.  After a few repetitions, you will be able to yawn as it should, and your throat will be completely satisfied. <br>  But a yawn is not the most important thing.  The most important is the moment as close as possible to catharsis.  Yawn again, and before you go to heaven, stretch the air out of your throat to make a loud sound.  Please note that it is not the letter that is to be pulled, but to exhale the air, and at the back of the head, a sound will appear, like mooing. <br>  Despite the fact that the ears during a yawn lay - you felt how loud your voice was. <br>  Yawn more, then try to pronounce some phrase. <br>  You will immediately notice that your voice has changed, become louder.  In an intelligent way - you resonate your voice, and due to this, it turns out louder.  So the voice should always be. <br><br><h4>  Results </h4><br>  A loud voice will quickly pass, so do not be discouraged. <br>  The main thing is that now you have realized the power of your voice, and have understood whether you need it. <br>  There are special exercises to consolidate this level, but this is not the purpose of the article, the purpose of the article was to try what it is. <br><br>  And on this article ends, thanks for being with us, I will be glad if you learned something new for yourself, and most importantly useful. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/95430/">https://habr.com/ru/post/95430/</a></p>
