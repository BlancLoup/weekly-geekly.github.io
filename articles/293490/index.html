However, some of these problems stem from misconceptions about mobile metering and data availability.  Below, we present a part of an interview given by eMarketer Craig Palli - Director of Strategic Planning at Fiksu, a provider of mobile marketing technologies.  From the article below, you will find out where the marketers got the wrong idea about mobile and why some common misconceptions about mobile advertising are still in people's minds. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>- What are the main misconceptions regarding mobile advertising?</b> <br><br>  The first and biggest misconception concerns the data in the mobile.  If you are working in the mobile application market, as a result you cannot collect good data.  However, the reality is that the capabilities of the metrics in the mobile are at least as good as the measurement capabilities in the desktop. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <b>- But if the measurement capabilities in the mobile are comparable to the desktop, where did these common misconceptions come from?</b> <br><br>  They follow from the fact that in the desktop everything is based on cookies, and cookies are not used in mobile applications.  Marketers say - "I can not use cookies, so I can not measure the effectiveness."  The reality is that in fact it is even easier to conduct metrics in mobile applications, because Apple and Google provide advertising identifiers.  But most digital infrastructures are not built around these mobile IDs. <br><br>  <b>- So, if it turns out that the mobile is very measurable, does it mean that marketers are fixated on measurements because it is difficult to compare the results in mobile with the desktop?</b> <br><br>  Many brands still do not know with which to compare the results in the mobile.  In fact, they should pay attention to different metrics.  In the desktop, you look at parameters such as how many impressions I received, how many unique visitors were on the website?  And how much time on the site they spent? <br><br>  In the mobile, do you replace these indicators with such as how many downloads I received (if it comes to the application)?  How many unique users interacted with the application?  How much time did they spend in it?  How many actions did they do there? <br><br>  There is a paradigm in mobile, close to the desktop, but you just need to modify the metrics a bit, to become more mobile-friendly.  After that, all data is presented in a much more pleasant light. <br><br>  Of course, certain differences exist. <br><br>  You will undoubtedly get more value in the mobile, because it is a marketing experience containing many events.  If I am Procter &amp; Gamble, and I want to show ads for one of my applications, I can register millions of impressions, many clicks, and these clicks will lead people to the app store directly to my page.  Great, isn't it? <br><br>  But from the side of brand marketing, they also receive a consumer on the page of their application, where there is an opportunity to immerse the user in the atmosphere inherent in the brand, due to the description and calls to action.  Then, if the user downloads a branded application, the brand is always present on the user's mobile device.  And as soon as the user starts to launch the application, he interacts with the brand again and again. <br><br>  In general, you can get a ton of benefits from mobile in terms of brand marketing.  The benefits obtained by this are far superior to what you can get in the desktop.  So mobile is very measurable. <br><br>  And yet, the mobile industry has yet to overcome obstacles in the eyes and minds of marketers regarding the difficulty in understanding data.  Let's assume that the average marketer buys mobile ads and understands that he needs to work with Apple and Android advertising identifiers.  The next thing they will surely say will be: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have available data to buy an audience, and some third-data providers don‚Äôt have enough information for me to work with them.‚Äù <br><br>  The reality is that a lot of mobile data is outside of that.  Marketers should be resourceful enough to say, ‚ÄúOk, and what are good data sources for creating an audience?‚Äù And then realize that once they have selected and built this audience, they will be able to access it better and more often than it could on the desktop. .  Marketers need to look for other partners than those with whom they worked in advertising on the desktop. <br><br> <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/register/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dcontent_marketing"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/041/3c5/29a/0413c529a1424210a02b160e54a40e80.png"></a> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg">BYYD ‚Ä¢ Mobile Advertising Platform</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/293490/">https://habr.com/ru/post/293490/</a></p>
