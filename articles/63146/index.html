  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Your company (do not) need sociality</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Ten years ago (someone suggests: ‚Äúalmost twenty‚Äù), the <strong>Internet</strong> fell on the head of companies of all kinds and colors.  I dare to suggest that for most of them he became a burden rather than a boon.  On the one hand: ‚Äú <em>everyone already has a damn site, that we are worse off, or what?</em>  "On the other:" <em>yes nafig need it?</em>  <em>We were born in this hole, so to speak.</em>  <em>And we will die in this hole</em> . ‚Äù  In the end, everything somehow settled down.  They all had terrible business cards, with horrible smiles on the faces of the CEO, and ‚Äúnews‚Äù the year before.  After some time, when the glasses, strung on ... say, the tail, did not help, the reasonable director of the middle hand triumphant in his own way, paternally patting the dull premium IT specialist.  ‚Äú <em>I told you, what a bad idea?</em>  <em>And you - ‚Äúgreat opportunities, many new customers‚Äù.</em>  <em>My client is as old as a beaver (putting on a hat from a relative and grunting).</em>  <em>Opened a newspaper, poked a finger, the price is low?</em>  <em>that's nice, that's called.</em>  <em>Well at least inexpensive cost ...</em> " <br><br>  Today things are much worse.  It would seem that other times and the Internet is different.  And the collective consciousness, and the magic of numbers (including the exchange ones) ... And the same beaver-director himself regularly sits in "one-eyed" and wonders how people pay bloody blood for the painted barabka.  But everything is worse and worse.  Now, even <em>two-and-a-half-zero</em> in all its glory is raining on its heads.  With social advancement, the human face of the company and Twitter, not to the night mentioned.  And again, vigorous IT specialists say that ‚Äú <em>it is necessary</em> ‚Äù.  And it seems really - ‚Äúnecessary.‚Äù  And the secretary-Valery grew nails from idleness, that the Chechen daggers (it would be better if the company led a blog, honestly).  But still, a sensible ‚Äú <strong>why</strong> ‚Äù flies alongside (again).  Which I want to milk. <br><br>  - Do you really want to hear what they say about your company (product, employees) in Kaluga?  Well, well, in Moscow, on Bauman?  And in thousands of different places.  And to hear in public.  And as an option - to respond in public, with the danger later to face your face in an obligingly framed archive with your answer.  I want to? <a name="habracut"></a>

      - And maybe I can not wait to enter into a discussion with competitors who have strong arguments in favor of their product?  Whose scouts have already seen the ‚Äúhelpfulness‚Äù of your staff, with a ‚Äúcourtesy‚Äù and ‚Äúpolite smile‚Äù explaining to the buyer why his case is not guaranteed? <br><br>  - It‚Äôs not scary to be spat upon quality for the fact that the design idea embedded in the new model (what do you get there?) Was (through the developers' heart attacks) repeatedly edited by your wife, who ‚Äústill cuts off in this business‚Äù? <br><br>  - It will be normal to respond to the comment of the client, who has gone nuts because of the fact that he is actually sitting at the moment. Does It Read Itself? <br><br>  - Is it a pity to hire a specialist for the correct, tasty presentation of company news, instead of tearing off the roller from the overlapping of pearl lacquer with a protective one?  And get a normal, readable text, instead of the junk that she ‚Äúpulls away‚Äù from the booklets. <br><br>  - Will it not be a shame to realize that your beautiful ‚Äúturbo-charged binder sets‚Äù, with a great creak, become the Runet's meme?  And if so, then only in a humor-negative sense.  And it‚Äôs sad to believe a PR person who for some reason is happy with all this, and says that this is necessary. <br><br>  - Is it not greedy to invite interested bloggers to a meeting, and to distribute to them, in addition to soup and memorable pens, something else that will be worthy of a post, even without a direct connection with your photo-complex? <br><br>  All of the above constitutes the integral parts of one big ‚Äú <strong>why</strong> ‚Äù.  And if it's not scary, not sorry, not greedy - then decide.  But if doubts are great, an incredulous grimace prevents shaving, and proudly cries in my head: ‚Äú <em>fix the accordion</em> ‚Äù, then ... Then please ( <strong>please!</strong> ) Now forget about it and do not do anything!  Nothing, hear?  No Twitter account with links to each of your dreary news, no google blog - a waste bin for your press releases and quasi-Kolkhoz editorials with yields ... N-and-h-e-oh!  Everyone will be better from this, believe in the word.  Do not disappoint and do not be disappointed. <br><br>  Thoughts associates will be <a href="http://www.design-freak.com/bloging/vashej-firme-nuzhna-socialnost/">there</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/63146/">https://habr.com/ru/post/63146/</a></p>
