Before that, she had HVZ Start-Highway (too uncomfortable landing), Ashanobike (too heavy), Merida (too many speeds) ... Shopping trips ended in the same vein - too small saddle, too much takeaway, too bright color ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I despaired to please her and calmed down during the autumn-winter period.  In winter, the problem with the transport accessibility of the new office suddenly became clear: there are no empty parking spaces, public transport is far away, and you are not walking to the nearest 5km train (although this is useful).  I began to look for a way to quickly overcome a couple of last miles.  Taxi is expensive.  A sport bike (like a scooter) is not for public roads and sidewalks.  Motorcycle at the expense of parking is comparable in price to a taxi.  Remains the bike.  Immediately drew attention to the Strida (and even tried to ride on it) and its analogs A-bike, Citybike, McFly.  So there was a basic requirement - compactness. <br><br><h4>  About the price </h4><br>  Prices for Strida LT in Russia start at $ 600.  I did not want to buy Strida's wife to find out that she had grenades of the wrong system.  Even if you take it for yourself, it is scary to leave such a moveable at the entrance.  Decided: buy an analog.

      If my wife likes it, she will, if not, I will go to work myself in the summer.  If she wants a Strida, she will be Strida, but this will be a meaningful desire. <br><br>  I accidentally saw an analogue for $ 120 on FOBe on the open spaces of the Chinese Internet - I became interested, searched for <b>16 inch folding bike</b> , found that the price range ‚Äúfrom them‚Äù ranges from $ 100 to $ 150 depending on the configuration (MOQ, bag, size wheels, spokes or alloy wheels, etc.).  But the delivery eats up all the interest of the buyer.  With delivery comes 300..360 $.  Found already on the expanses of our Internet an acceptable option and ... <br>  bought it. <br><br><h4>  First impression </h4><br>  The bike was a surprise for my wife.  He brought, she sat down, drove and fell in love with him.  Even complaints about a hard saddle were quite constructive - replace the saddle (in the photo the saddle is no longer native).  Merry little red color, weighs a little (about 11 kg), takes up little space, and, apparently, the main thing - no one in our city has such a thing! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9ac/75f/1c7/9ac75f1c7cbd48dc827c05277a605127.jpg"><br><br>  Since it was not possible to take away a new toy from my wife, I had to buy a second, little black one, for myself.  Therefore, do not be surprised if there are photos of two bikes in this review. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/129/739/680/12973968051d4f7da8f36277da701e83.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Packaging </h4><br>  The bicycle is packed in a huge box (1150x300x600mm) with a volume of 0.2 cubic meters - a full-size bicycle can be packed in the same box.  Gross <s>net</s> weight of about 15kg. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1a7/baa/6d5/1a7baa6d5f68422bbed9be2afd2d1633.jpg"><br><br>  For the preservation of cargo used foam liners.  For reliability, the bike in the box is wrapped with polyurethane foam tape. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/98a/787/dc2/98a787dc22fc41df8457fd573e7dedfc.jpg"><br><br>  My package includes <ul><li>  box, with packaging inserts and winding </li><li>  bicycle </li><li>  trunk (already installed and with a red reflector) </li><li>  call (some offer it as a gift) </li><li>  carrying case </li><li>  silicone stickers (already pasted) </li><li>  bag with tools (four hex keys 4mm, 5mm, 6mm, 8mm) </li><li>  instruction (hurray! in english). </li></ul><br><br>  Overall dimensions in the folded state 1120x500x280. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/10d/71f/d40/10d71fd4081c44998a402065e112cb02.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Restrictions </h4><br>  The characteristics stated height of the cyclist from 145 to 190cm.  Apparently these are Chinese centimeters and should be treated with caution.  For cyclists up to 160 cm tall, it is required to lower the saddle as much as possible, which will make it impossible to install the trunk.  Those.  in the growth range of 145..160cm, the trunk cannot be used without modifications, because the lower support of the trunk cannot be fixed due to the bending of the frame (indicated by an arrow). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/13a/4e1/8bc/13a4e18bcf93457ebd3f34bc6c2e241f.jpg"><br><br>  A bicyclist with a height of 190 cm, regardless of the position of the saddle, can reach the wheel with his lap.  With my height of 180, sometimes I hit the steering wheel on my turn with my knees. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/825/038/c79/825038c79bfc495bbce3b55fd2f33d30.jpg"><br><br>  So before you remotely buy such a bike, try to find it in real life and try it on yourself. <br><br>  Folding and plastic pedals.  It is forbidden to stand on the pedals, go on the pedals, jump on the curbs.  It is also forbidden in the instructions: to ride in the ice, to roll down the stairs, to ride on the rear wheel. <br><br>  When driving uphill, the drive belt may slip.  Adjusting the tension, if necessary, is made by moving the pedal assembly.  The arrows indicate the screws fastening the assembly to the frame. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/819/515/02a/81951502a3ed4d05be05686f3bffbc19.jpg"><br>  <font color="#FFFFF">This is a city bike, Karl!</font> <br><br><h4>  Doping </h4><br>  Traditionally, it is necessary to check the brakes before the trip and adjust them if necessary. <br>  The left and right (front and rear) brake drives are ‚Äúmixed up‚Äù.  Pressing the right grip causes (on a motorcycle) the operation of the front brake, on the left - the rear.  You can transfer cables, but for this you need to get them out of the frame. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e63/0b0/07b/e630b007be7647849845c34a1adb4d38.jpg"><br><br>  The 4 screws of fastening of a saddle have a thread length of 30mm and are jammed with plastic locking nuts.  In the process of changing the height of the saddle, I bent them a little, and then twisting, cut the lock-nut through. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/58e/7d7/e52/58e7d7e52b294ac89ed70f98bcb75c69.jpg"><br><br>  I am not going to change the height of the saddle anymore, so I replaced the screws with 20 mm, setting it for reliability with glue to fix the threaded connection.  Now the screws do not protrude.  In the photo the upper shortened screw, the lower one as it looked before. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ff7/d4e/464/ff7d4e4645a340f4bfd78ba4b124770e.jpg"><br><br>  Wife complained about an uncomfortable saddle.  I had to replace him.  Caution: seat inclination is not adjustable. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/148/49c/9cc/14849c9ccf3043358813c323e32ba2fc.jpg"><br><br>  When folded, the hinge rubs against the frame.  In Strida in these places there are special overlays.  Silicone pad 0.5mm thick is provided in the purchased bikes.  Its thickness is not enough, in addition, it is shifted.  Not only blue electrical tape will help us avoid scratches. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9ad/2ac/d57/9ad2acd573544df19e4750be147640c1.jpg"><br><br>  As a result of careless casting into combat readiness, he dropped a part of a bicycle with pedals on a stone.  The blow fell on a plastic star, from which a piece broke off.  By the way on the photo the only brand "Great Wall".  No more brands and labels found. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8e7/97a/f62/8e797af6247a49b58bffacc7302ffb7f.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Results </h4><br>  Bike rides well on asphalt or forest path.  Worse on cobblestone and gravel.  Sand and slush does not tolerate.  In the rain water falls on the <s>chain</s> belt, which can cause it to slip. <br><br>  Great speed on this bike does not develop: prevents the landing of the windage, the landing itself.  Maximum 20km / h. <br>  You can‚Äôt train for long: landing features.  Steering sharp.  A walk at 2 o'clock is a pleasure, the more you‚Äôre already tense. <br>  The wheels are relatively small - 16 inches.  Because of the collapsible design of the frame on the curbs do not jump. <br><br>  But he is very small.  Throwing 3 bicycles in the trunk (although one of them is classic - for children), without removing the wheels, it is easy to go to the park! <br><br>  Bicycles delight.  Cheer up.  Passersby look around. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Excuse</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  In the process of writing a review, no pedestrian was injured.
