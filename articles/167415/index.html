At the dawn of humanity, people ‚Äúcorresponded‚Äù with pictures - this is how rock art came into being.  The fact that the information submitted in pictures is assimilated more easily, every mother intuitively knows - the very first books for children are books consisting of only one pictures.  All parents also know that children like cartoons more than books. <br><br>  <i><b>The picture is more important than the text</b></i> .  Therefore, comics are so popular among adults.  However, the older a person becomes, the more often he uses words rather than pictures to explain.

      This is largely facilitated by the notorious left hemisphere formation.  Lectures are dictated, the answers at the blackboard are reduced in most cases to retelling the text.  As a result, the majority of adults do not draw anything - it does not know how to draw. <br><br>  Hence the difficulties: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  ‚Ä¢ Firstly communication difficulties.  Some things are difficult to explain in words. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Secondly - difficulties with remembering.  The visual image is remembered faster and easier to play. <br><br>  In fact, everyone knows about it.  But the teacher calls ‚Äúto put my hands calmly and not to draw while explaining the material,‚Äù as well as a general complex called ‚ÄúI do not know how to draw‚Äù usually completely replaces this knowledge.  And therefore adults for the rest of their lives make up presentations consisting of a set of pages of text in which they themselves cannot remember anything. <br><br>  <b>About the book</b> <br>  To be honest, if I saw this book in a store, I would not buy it.  The format is rather inconvenient.  And it definitely doesn‚Äôt fit into the regiment with the old books from MYTH. <br><br>  But anyway, the book was in my hands and was read by me.  True for the first time I wanted to quit reading on page 10.  But with an effort of will, I forced myself to continue reading.  On page 125, I was interested in some phrases, it became easier to read, but by the 250 page reading was slowed down again. <br><br>  Why this happened to me I can describe with the words of the author himself: <br>  ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúWords can describe anything.  But this does not mean that words are the best way to describe everything around. ‚Äù <br>  ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúHe had a map, and he wanted to bring us out of the forest verbiage.  And he succeeded.  True, the extra circles we have with him, nevertheless, screwed ... " <br>  ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúBy incorrectly using language and speech, we spoil our own ideas.‚Äù <br><br>  Here I can say that the book causes mixed feelings.  On the one hand, it‚Äôs about using as many visual images as possible in life, on the other hand, there‚Äôs so much blah-blah in the book itself that in some places the meaning of what is written is lost.  Or blah blah blah perception makes it so difficult that it is difficult to understand - and what was it all about?  but it makes a thoughtful reader go back a couple of pages. <br><br>  I think that <b>it would be possible to shorten the book approximately by half, while the essence of the information would not have suffered</b> .  Helping the reader to get rid of the Blablandia author, often he himself can not get out of it. <br><br>  I can recommend <b>those who have not yet read the book</b> to read it in a metered dose, not to try to master it with ‚Äúimpudence‚Äù, and immediately put the received recommendations into practice.  And you need to practice in all available ways: <br>  ‚Ä¢ talking to homeworkers about how to divide homework between everyone is best to draw a beautiful scheme, clearly showing the distribution of responsibilities; <br>  ‚Ä¢ studying a new part of the information for yourself, draw a picture, providing the pictures with brief captions; <br>  ‚Ä¢ when composing a presentation, provide it with pictures, and pronounce the text out loud. <br>  ‚Ä¢ and so on‚Ä¶ <br><br>  Replacing part of the words with images, ‚Äúwe help the brain find a simpler way to think about and share complex ideas.‚Äù  That, in fact, is the whole essence of the book on Bla-Bla-Bla. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/167415/">https://habr.com/ru/post/167415/</a></p>
