      - I wasn‚Äôt remember much.  I do speak some Russian, but not Ukranian.  Unfortunately, I don‚Äôt have much to say.  I‚Äôm at PyCon Russia. <br><br>  <b>- How did you get into the Python community?</b> <br><br>  I always had a good interest in html.  When I was younger, we didn't have a computer.  I learned most of the basics in University. <br><br>  After University, I spent a long time working as an enterprise Java developer.  I didn‚Äôt know what to ask for.  I was unhappy with the phantom and I <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">learned how to write</a> a program.  Learning Python for the smaller, more creative, and more innovative companies.  Everyone was incredibly friendly and welcoming.  It felt like one big family.  I've been lucky to be part of the community ever since. <br><br>  <b>- You work at Venmo</b>  <b>How do you change the financial world?</b>  <b>Does Python make a difference there?</b> <br><br>  - Venmo has redefined person to person payments, and come out of it even as big companies like Apple are struggling in the space.  It is a bit agile agile practice. <br><br>  <b>- What are you working on currently?</b> <br><br>  - I‚Äôm working to improve our internal engineering practices.  This is an eight-year-old codebase. <br><br>  In my free time, I have been working microcontrollers. <br><br>  <b>- You worked for such well-know companies as Reddit and HBO.</b>  <b>What did you do there?</b>  <b>What was the most fascinating / remarkable / surprisingly your work there?</b> <br><br>  It is important that it is important to - in many different areas.  When I worked at HBO, I‚Äôve been working for satellite control computers. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/F6u5rhUQ6dU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <i>Speech by Nina at PyCon 2016</i> <br><br>  <b>- What's the programmer?</b> <br><br>  - I work 100% remotely, it‚Äôs not a problem.  The downside is sometimes working remotely feels isolating, especially since most of my team is three hours ahead of me.  I am trying to tackle the co-working spaces, coffee shops, and meetups. <br><br>  <b>- what do you consider your life at this point?</b> <br><br>  - That's a difficult question to answer.  It‚Äôs not a problem. <br><br>  Conquering fears.  Even though I was battled by unfinished fears of not being a good enough software engineer.  I am aware of my knowledge of the python.  A few years ago, I had an extreme phobia of public speaking.  I started this week at the podium.  It has been a great deal to make you know about the world's most advanced conferences around the world, such as DjangoCon, PyCon, and WebExpo in Prague. <br><br>  <b>- What's the biggest problem of the Python community?</b> <br><br>  - In my opinion, the community revolve around open source projects.  I‚Äôve seen many new contributors get bored by bike-shedding, or too many people.  The community is still more aware of the community.  It is a fact that he has been in charge of the project.  I am seeing the Pythonistas in the hallway of PyCon every year, although we still have a long way to go. <br><br>  <b>- Which tools do you use in your everyday work?</b> <br><br>  For maximum productivity, I‚Äôm on the command line.  I use emacs for my editor, tmux for window management, and oh-my-zsh for a shell.  I need to <a href="https://twitter.com/nnja/status/839302515036319744">know how to do it</a> . <br><br>  <b>- Do you read any Python blogs?</b>  <b>Would you recommend?</b> <br><br>  - I mostly keep it up to date with the Python community on twitter.  I like to keep busy  I'm also a fan of the <a href="http://www.pythonweekly.com/">Python Weekly</a> newsletter. <br><br>  <b>- You do lots of outdoor sports: skiing, snowboarding, mountain biking, rock climbing.</b>  <b>Which style do you prefer: reckless or careful?</b>  <b>:) What's your greatest adventure so far?</b> <br><br>  - I love adventuring, but I'm always careful!  I have an extreme care to protect myself.  I have quite a helmet, one for each sport.  I wouldn‚Äôt have been in this situation. <br><br>  I've had too many amazing adventures to count.  I was in Salt Lake City.  There is nothing more than a mountain peak! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/f71/a98/b11/f71a98b113a846f1a88ee55c8e533625.jpg"><br><br>  On July 16-17, at PyConRu Nina will talk about common anti-patterns in python programs and show practical python solutions on how to improve your code with the help of decorators, context managers, lambdas and mixins.  The remaining speakers can be viewed <a href="http://pycon.ru/2017/program/schedule/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3D10.06">on the conference website</a> . <br><br><hr><br>  Thanks to our sponsors who make the conference possible: the gold sponsor <a href="https://adcombo.com/">Adcombo</a> , the energy and good mood partner of <a href="https://adcombo.com/">CIAN</a> , the silver sponsor <a href="https://rambler-co.ru/jobs">Rambler &amp; Co</a> and <a href="https://domclick.ru/">DomKlik</a> , the bronze sponsor <a href="http://mediascope.net/">MediaScope</a> .
