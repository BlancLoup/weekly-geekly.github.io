      Those who still do not understand, I ask under the cat <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h5>  Retina Display + iBooks + eBay <strong>vs.</strong>  Amazon + Kindle / Barnes &amp; Noble + Nook / ... </h5><br>  During the presentation, Jobs reports a lot of interesting information that is quite simple to combine and draw conclusions. <br><br>  1. iBooks + iBookStore <br><br>  At the moment, about 5 million books have been sold, 2.5 for each iPad.  It would seem - so what?  If you take Jobs' words on faith, it turns out that these books already make up 22% of (I think electronic) books sold by the four largest publishers in the States. <br><br>  22% for eight weeks of iPad life.  If the trend continues, Apple will easily capture, if not more, then an impressive part of the e-book market.  Considering that over the past two years this Rnok has grown by leaps and bounds ( <a href="http://paidcontent.org/article/419-ten-predictions-for-the-e-book-market-in-2010/">176%</a> ) and threatens to reach 500 million dollars in 2010, this piece is very tasty. <br><br>  2. iPad <br><br>  In eight weeks, Apple sold 2 million iPads.  Amazon is hiding the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Wireless-Reading-Display-Generation/dp/B0015T963C">Kindle's</a> sales data with all its might, but it‚Äôs believed that in just two years of this reader‚Äôs existence, they were sold ... <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/01/29/3-million-amazon-kindles-sold-apparently/">3 million</a> units. <br><br>  At the same time, Amazon occupies 60% of the US e-reader market.  A disappointing comparison for the leader, especially given the unexpected (?) Popularity of the iBookStore. <br><br>  3. Magazines <br><br>  In addition to the ability to read books, many readers also advertise the ability to read your favorite magazines and newspapers ( <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Magazines-Journals-Kindle/b%3Fie%3DUTF8%26node%3D241646011">for example</a> ). <br><br>  Here, in principle, there is nothing to talk about.  It is enough to see a demonstration of the <a href="http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2010/02/the-wired-ipad-app-a-video-demonstration/">Wired magazine for the iPad</a> (a link to 5 videos, I advise you to watch all). <br><br>  4. Retina Display. <br><br>  No wonder Jobs at the very beginning, and for quite a long time speaks precisely about letters and text display.  It is not for nothing that the first thing that it shows is the page of an online publication with text (and not photos).  No wonder he says that the human eye distinguishes no more than 300 dots per dum, despite the fact that the screen in the new iPhone is 326 dots per inch. <br><br>  It all comes down to a simple sentence: ‚Äúwe give you a great alternative to e-ink.‚Äù  And the hint is very transparent: wait for this screen on iPads next year. <br><br>  During the presentation of the fourth iPhone, Bezos (the president of Amazon) was supposed to drink Corvalol with horse doses.  Amazon doesn't offer anything close to it.  And if he offered, the next item is against them. <br><br><h5>  1 billion dollars vs.  Android Marketplace </h5><br>  This part of the presentation was supposed to make the hearts of the developers beat faster.  "We paid about $ 1 billion to application developers in the AppStore." <br><br>  This is a direct hit on the Android Marketplace.  Many developers (and especially game developers) <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/171259/developers_complain_about_android_sales.html">complain</a> that it‚Äôs impossible to earn at least some significant money on an android.  Indeed, the policy ‚Äúwe will return the money for the application in 24 hours‚Äù pleases users, but it strongly beats many developers.  And Apple is well aware of this. <br><br>  A billion dollars to everyone and no one will leave offended.  Who would refuse to grab this piece of cake? <br><br><h5>  FaceTime <strong>vs.</strong>  Skype </h5><br>  ‚ÄúPhi.  Wi-Fi only.  Only iPhone4 with iPhone4.  How can this guano be called innovation? ‚ÄùThis is how about the video calls of appleflovers. <br><br>  But let's see this presentation for just a minute more and see what Jobs actually offers.  And he proposes, no less than nothing, to <em>standardize</em> the FaceTime protocol.  He proposes to make it <em>an open standard</em> and says that it is already based on well-known, accessible and open standards (what he calls ‚Äúalpha porridge‚Äù in the presentation). <br><br>  That is a year or two and, you see, we‚Äôll start talking Android &lt;-&gt; iPhone and no one will say a word against it.  Apple needed to negotiate with the PPSC about 3G.  Yes, and penetration of FaceTime'a on desktops, too, perhaps, only a matter of time. <br><br><h5>  Gyro <strong>vs.</strong>  Nintendo DS / Sony PSP </h5><br><br>  When the iPhone came out with an accelerometer, it was also ‚Äúnot needed.‚Äù  It turned out that not only needed, but also used in various applications and - most importantly!  - in games. <br><br>  At the iPhoneOS 4 presentation, Jobs showed a curious slide: <br><br><img src="http://mobilenews.omio.com/wp-content/apple-ipod-sept-09-1293-rm-eng.jpg"><br><br>  Just think about these numbers. <br><br>  About 50 million iPhones, about 60 million PSPs and about 129 million Nintendo DS have been sold worldwide.  iPhones (and now iPads) have become direct competitors to mobile gaming consoles.  At the same time, they offer additional features in comparison with them - an accelerometer, and now also a gyroscope. <br><br>  iPhone and iPad, of course, are inferior to the specialized processor of the same PSP, but Apple pulls over a blanket of casual games, the market of which can reach <a href="http://www.casualgaming.biz/news/27481/Vrabeck-Casual-market-worth-135bn-by-2010">$ 13 billion</a> <br><br><h5>  So what? </h5><br>  Behind all the controversies about megapixels, multitasking, processor speeds, hardware in the case, etc.  debaters do not see the most important thing.  Apple (albeit at the time) is not going to make technical revolutions.  By and large, it never suited them (everything that Apple shows either was implemented before them or was known for decades - see multitouch). <br><br>  Apple acts differently.  They offer an easy-to-use product that not only forms a new market (‚Äútablets‚Äù / tablets), but also invades other markets (e-books, casual games, before that - with the iPod - the music market).  At the same time, they manage to do it easily, without tension, and only increasing the pace of marketing of products and capturing new niches. <br><br>  That is what should interest us, as developers and users, and not the technical specifications of devices that are already similar to each other, like twins.  That's what these devices allow their companies to do - this is a very, very interesting question. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/95994/">https://habr.com/ru/post/95994/</a></p>
