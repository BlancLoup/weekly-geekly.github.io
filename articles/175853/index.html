Once an academician told me: ‚ÄúWell, how do you want?  An implant is by definition an invasion of a foreign object into the body.  Must be your own.  Making your own!  Since then, for me, the realization that the tool does not work exactly as it was intended is the best sign of development.  The team or employee upgraded in their own way and began to use.  And even better when the team takes two different tools and combines them.  It happened this time. <br><br>  From the title of the topic and the picture, the essence of the idea will be immediately clear.

      About the benefits and convenience of the Eisenhower matrix was previously written on Habr√© <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/120517/">here</a> and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/121804/">here</a> .  I suggest to get acquainted with these materials.  From myself I will add that this is a very good tool to bring the head in order, when everything is burning and you do not know what to grab.  At first glance it seems that everything is urgent and everything must be done and, naturally, everything falls into the urgent-important quadrant.  But your task is to evenly distribute tasks, and you begin, reluctantly, to spread them in quadrants in comparison.  Then you get carried away and it turns out there are clear criteria for what you can score and what should be delegated to subordinates. <br><br>  That's how I explained the action of the quadrant to our startup manager (Vika, 23 years old).  And together we dealt with an avalanche of tasks that fell on her on the eve of the combat launch of the project to the market (beta testing passed).  After all, before that, we quietly sawed a project designer, and then immediately: do a center, hire people, ad campaign, create applications for mobile platforms, redesign the web, ... and everything is urgent, everything is yesterday. <br><br>  So we figured out an example with a part of the tasks that have already been described.  Clear?  Clear!  Further it is also necessary to systematize and deal with the other tasks independently.  I come to the office a couple of days later and I see one of our boards in a strange state. <br>  Vick built a quadrant in the first stage on the board. <br><br>  On the scrum-board, large horizontal sections divide the tasks according to features. <br>  In the first vertical section ‚Äúplan‚Äù - the feature is divided into the ‚Äúurgent-important‚Äù quadrant. <br>  It helps to visualize the priorities and importance of tasks. <br>  Based on this, you can conveniently balance the resource between features. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/34d/f82/d61/34df82d616b072878b7e024d000f02a7.jpg"><br><br>  In total, we have a very useful strategic board for product management.  It can be said, a visual representation of the product-backlog.  In fact, more kanban than scrum, because  clear tacts can not be observed everywhere (for example, in hiring), but different features can go separately either on the screen or on the kanban. <br>  For example, the development of a web application and a mobile application are different features with measures. <br>  We decided to try to transfer this tool to the development of other projects. <br>  We thought about whether to insert the quadrant in other columns.  For example, in ‚ÄúDO - in process‚Äù this would be relevant for a feature in which there may be long-term processes. <br><br>  We continue this interesting experiment. <br>  Very interesting are your thoughts on this. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/175853/">https://habr.com/ru/post/175853/</a></p>
