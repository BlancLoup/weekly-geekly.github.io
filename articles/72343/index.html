  <section class="page js-page"><h1>MashPit in Minsk. We make projects in 48 hours</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently in St. Petersburg, HackDay was held, in Bratislava - <a href="http://sicamp-cee.net/">Social Innovation Camp</a> , somewhere else Code Sprint are constantly being held.  This means only one thing - the interest of progressive humanity to events that are entirely devoted to practice (read - to create projects and master classes), and not theories (read to presentations) grows by leaps and bounds. <br><br>  Belarus, as usual, risked being aloof from global trends, if it were not for the desire of several unbiased people to conduct a small experiment with us - a <a href="http://mashpit.org/">MashPit event</a> during the annual conference ‚ÄúBusiness Internet‚Äù (but not with an affiliate conference).  This decision was spontaneous, as, indeed, the organization of the event, which begins tomorrow!  Yes Yes Yes! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Why MashPit?</b> <br>  This technology was invented and tested by Chris Messina and ‚Äúpatented‚Äù by him as a ‚Äúcommunity mark‚Äù (a term that he himself invented).  That is, everyone can spend a mashpit in his city or area, and it will be completely legal.  Just like barcamps, from which, by the way, a lot is taken.  This is the self-organization of the participants, the informal atmosphere, the absence of a pre-arranged TK, etc.  And this is actually very good, because events of this kind really activate in us those hidden reserves that usually sleep under the quiet buzz of office computers.  If you can, then do it; if not, just leave or become a spectator. <br><br>  Now we know for sure - we will work with Google Maps and the map of Minsk (which only recently began to appear on Maps).  What we will display on it, what technologies to use is not yet known.  Nor is it clear whether we will have one big team or several groups will arrange a real competition.

      The event is designed for both experienced developers who can show their talents or learn new things, as well as amateurs - after all, we still have a lot of work to put an entire country on Google Maps.  So why not start right now? <br><br>  We have about 48 hours to come up with and implement a real Internet project that would be useful not only for us.  And if there is time and energy - why not make them several? <br><br>  It is curious that, like any event that does not fit into certain frameworks in Belarus (I did not see them, but I feel that they exist), our completely volunteer initiative caused a lot of negative emotions and active trolling on Twitter.  If someone explains to me, what is wrong in Belarusians and how to correct this mentality, which is characterized by a nasty desire to podgadit, where you least expect, put a beer :) <br><br>  So people, if you live in Minsk and want to know what it will be, or even better, are ready to participate, offer your ideas and implement them, register on the site, contact us by any means.  After all, only together we will make MashPit a successful project, and maybe - the first in a series of similar ones. <br><br>  And who knows - maybe we can change something ... <br><br>  Our website: <a href="http://mashpit.newmedia.by/">http://mashpit.newmedia.by</a> , hash tag on Twitter and blogs - <b>#mashby</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/72343/">https://habr.com/ru/post/72343/</a></p>
