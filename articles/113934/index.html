  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Hard disk and risk factor</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Very often, our clients ask for advice on which hard drive they should buy.  They are guided in addressing the issue precisely to us that we have information about the most frequent failure of hard drives of a certain company.  We hurry to disappoint our customers, since the presence in repair of a larger number of disks of a company, can not serve as an indicator that this company produces unreliable disks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/136a038e/0b095af8/9a17920b/e95449fb.jpg"><br><br>  <strong>Here it is, our most important risk factor.</strong> <br>  <em>Photo from <a href="https://lori.ru/">Lori's photobank.</a></em> <em><br></em> <br>  Too many factors affect the statistics statistics.  There is such a situation, when the hard drives of any one manufacturer flooded the market in a certain time period, and, as a result, the presence of every second user of this particular hard drive, leads to the fact that they get into repairs more often.  It is logical to conclude that the reliability of a particular model could be assessed by comparing the number of disks sold and the number of broken ones.  True, such conclusions will not be entirely true either, since there are a great many additional factors. <br>  For example, in which statistics can the next case fit? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Somehow a respectable man gradually enters the office, pulls the disc and, embarrassed, asks: ‚ÄúCould you help me, I really need to recover the data from the disc.  You see, I am a lawyer, there is the information I need for work. ‚Äù <br>  Find out what happened to the disk.  The customer, a little embarrassed, pulls a trembling creature out of his bosom, who looks around in horror and says: ‚ÄúWell, you see, he is afraid of being alone.  This is such a breed of dogs cowardly, chow-chow.  It is necessary to carry everywhere with you.  And then earned, and he sat on the table.  The phone rang, it was out of fear and let a puddle, but right on the disk.  Acid, you know, how to recover. ‚Äù <br>  And if you think that this is a single case and you can ignore it, referring to the statistical error, then you are deeply mistaken.  The love of our people for cats and dogs, as well as the constant presence on the table of cups of hot coffee or even broth, leads to predictable consequences.  And this is not the most difficult cases.  You can familiarize yourself with the original adventures of our customers from us.  <a href="https://www.datarc.ru/blog/2010/07/greshno-smeyatsya/">Here and a cleaner with a broom, and the question of family happiness.</a> <br>  There was a time when users quietly purchased discs, paying absolutely no attention to their brand.  But, as always, failed the incident.  In the early 2000s, manufacturers have released several series of unreliable models of hard drives.  When purchasing these hard drives, many users faced some of the same problem during their operation.  The news of this incident was widely distributed through word of mouth and on the Internet.  After that, there was a question about the possibility of choosing a reliable manufacturer.  Manufacturers who made such a mistake, long and quietly left the market.  And the remaining brands on the market are so close to each other in terms of the technologies used, that it is often unwise to seek out the best manufacturer among them. <br>  From all this, it follows that the choice of a hard drive should be guided not by the brand, the brand of the manufacturer, but mainly by the characteristics that you expect from it. <br>  It should be borne in mind that for optimal operation of the computer all its components must be balanced in performance.  Therefore, when buying a hard drive, you should try to choose the main characteristics of its model in accordance with the main characteristics of the computer.  For graphic stations, publishing systems, these will be some of the characteristics; for the implementation of standard office applications, others.  And the necessary parameters of the hard drives for the database server will be completely different. <br><habracut><br>  Draw conclusions.  Hard drives of all manufacturers are equally reliable.  You need to select the disks you need in accordance with its technical parameters and your financial capabilities.  And in more detail about whether it is possible to say that the disk of a certain company is reliable, you can <a href="https://www.datarc.ru/articles/how_to_choose_a_reliable_hard_drive.html">read here</a> . <br>  And most importantly, protect the discs from "risk factors" with tails, ears and sharp claws.  You will not believe it, since there are no official data, but our corporate statistics are calling out: ‚ÄúWatch out‚Äù - but not the car, next time about it, but a sweet and affectionate pet.  So can we do the research? <br>  There are people injured? </habracut></div>
