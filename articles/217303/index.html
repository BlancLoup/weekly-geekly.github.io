The R820 server has 48 DIMM memory modules and up to 1.5TB of DDR3 RAM along with seven PCIe 3.0 slots, support for additional GPU accelerators, and a number of Dell Select Network Adapter network adapters for connecting to the main matrix switches without using a PCIe slot.  You can increase I / O speed with four optional Express Flash PCIe SSDs that are operatively connected to the front panel for high-speed distribution of incoming data for storage. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/02e/3bb/415/02e3bb4156e37f5a03d719769c30d311.jpg" alt="Dell PowerEdge R820 12G"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  For the first time, Express Flash drives were introduced to the 12th generation PowerEdge R720 server model, which became the mainstay of our corporate testing laboratory.  The considered R820 server is not equipped with Express Flash drives, and this is the main difference for those who are looking for the best combination of high performance and operational reliability.  Like its brother, the R820 is equipped with Intel Xeon E5 processors.  The R820 server supports four Xeon E5-4600 family CPUs, as opposed to the two supported in the R720.  Additional storage options include support for dual RAID controllers and up to 16 internal hard drives. <br><br>  The storage flexibility of the R820, as well as the direct computing power of four Intel CPUs with a 2U form factor, draw attention to the R820 server in many cases.  The bottom line is that the R820 has more performance with a smaller body area than conventional servers with a height of 2U.  For a business that requires significant computing power, multi-user access or dozens of computers, the advantages of this server are obvious.  Equipped with a quad-core processor, the <a href="http://www.saronit.ru/catalog/dell-servers">Dell</a> R820 <a href="http://www.saronit.ru/catalog/dell-servers">servers</a> will help to significantly save space, reduce power consumption and reduce the costs associated with server maintenance, which increase with increasing number of machines.

With the support of two additional processors, the R820 server is equipped with a daughter network card located above the motherboard and connected via a quick-disconnect connection.  Opening the locking element, you can get the entire unit to access the processors and RAM sockets on the motherboard.  The <a href="http://www.saronit.ru/catalog/dell-servers">PowerEdge</a> R820 configuration allows up to 48 DDR3 DIMM memory modules (twice the size of the R720).  The model in question has 16 GB of DIMM memory, providing a total of 256 GB of RAM. <br><br>  Both sliding and fixed guides are available for mounting without the use of special tools, in racks with four supports with square or round holes without threads, or in racks with four supports with threaded holes with tools.  Fixed guides for rack mounting with two supports (Telco).  An additional cable-mounting bracket can be mounted in the left or right part of the sliding guides without the use of special tools. <br>  To install the R820 server on the rails without using special tools, you need to hold the server by the handles on the front and rear panels, carefully lowering the server on the rails with aligned mounting pins and the corresponding connectors.  Experience has shown that this method is more convenient and faster than other guidance systems. <br><br><h6>  <b>Control and management</b> </h6><br>  <a href="http://www.saronit.ru/catalog/dell-servers">The 12th generation PowerEdge servers</a> , including the R820 and R720, are part of the OpenManage platform for managing with and without agents.  At the center of the OpenManage platform configuration is the iDRAC7 with a life cycle controller.  For integration with agent-based solutions, OpenManage Server Administraton (OMSA) offers direct management systems with a command-line interface or a browser-based Java GUI. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fad/ba9/474/fadba9474d7a8dde35f3d008c991df4f.png"><br><br>  The iDRAC7 Enterprise is available in the PowerEdge R820 server along with the iDRAC7 Express, which has many features available in the enterprise version.  Dell OpenManage Power Center provides power management at the level of the rack, row and data center.  The R820 server has the ability to use uninterrupted virtual system idle time hypervisor using duplicate SD cards. <br><br><h6>  <b>Conclusion</b> </h6><br>  Like the <a href="http://www.saronit.ru/catalog/dell-poweredge-r720xd">PowerEdge R720 server</a> , when using the Express Flash PCIe drive that is operably connected to the front panel of the server, the R820 server shows advantages in storing data over other servers.
