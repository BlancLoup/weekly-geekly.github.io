We have not yet formed a legal entity, but the site is already working in demo mode (you can rate one of the four planned models).  As you can see, we are at the very beginning of the startup path.  In our blog on Habr√©, I will write about the problems that arise from the manager of the company, the project manager, the product manager and in general the handyman.

      Today I will tell you how to solve the problem of choosing between ... Anything.  I am intrigued by the cat. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  It is always important for us to have choice absolutely in any situation.  Even if you can see one specific solution, we are still looking for other options so that there is, with what to compare, to search for pitfalls or plan "B".  But if a person has at least one alternative, then you have to make a choice (KO O. returns).  And here the most interesting begins, because the question arises: how will it be more correct? <br><br>  Well, if you have to choose between ice cream and chocolate.  But sometimes it is necessary to solve more complex issues: <br><ul><li>  Which car to choose? </li><li>  Leave work at a new place or stay? </li><li>  Mortgage or rent an apartment? </li><li>  Work or your business? </li><li>  Chicken or egg? </li></ul><br><br>  Surely each of you faced a difficult choice and knows that frivolity can turn out badly, so you should think about the question properly.  I really like one extremely simple way to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of a particular solution - the selection table (pros and cons model).  This is quite trivial, but clearly. <br><br>  I don't like a lot of theory, so let's get to the bottom line.  For example, the choice between going to a cafe / restaurant and ordering food from the nearest pizzeria.  The table below has 3 columns and 5 rows.  You can not really look at my example, but use your alternatives and freely adjust their number, as well as the number of their decisions.  If you immediately draw your table, I strongly recommend using more rows to make the table more visual and specific. <br><br><table><tbody><tr><td></td><th>  Cafe </th><th>  a restaurant </th></tr><tr><th>  time </th><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><th>  convenience </th><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><th>  quality </th><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><th>  price </th><th></th><td></td></tr></tbody></table><br><br>  As you have already noticed, criteria are written in the left column, and our options are in the top line.  In this case, we have them 2: "Go to the cafe" and "Order food for the house."  Next, fill in the factor lines that we will focus on when evaluating the solution.  In the first line, for example, we note the approximate amount of time spent.  And so fill the table.  The completed version of the selection model is below. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fec/ed6/8b2/feced68b298b43c01ce4cf90bd3f211a.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Yes, it is significantly different from the original one, which I drew in the Word, since I did this already on the website of our company.  It has one very interesting feature - points.  They help well for clarity and ergonomics of the table.  In this type of pros and cons model, a scale from -5 to 5 is used, which allows you to mix up both the positive aspects of the solution and the negative, without sacrificing the transparency of the table.  At the very bottom, the points are summed up, and the site suggests which solution is more attractive in this case.  No magic, everything is very simple: you yourself decided which option is more promising, the computer only analyzed the totality of the assessments you selected. <br>  It‚Äôs inconvenient to mess around with paper, so you can use the following options for organizing this model: <br><ol><li>  In each line with the criterion, separately identify the minuses and separately the advantages of each solution: <br><br><table><tbody><tr><td></td><th>  solution 1 </th><th>  solution 2 </th></tr><tr><th rowspan="2">  criterion 1 </th><td>  pros </td><td>  pros </td></tr><tr><td>  minuses </td><td>  minuses </td></tr><tr><th rowspan="2">  criterion 2 </th><td>  pros </td><td>  pros </td></tr><tr><td>  minuses </td><td>  minuses </td></tr></tbody></table><br></li><li>  First, list all the advantages of your decisions, and then all the disadvantages, or vice versa: <br><br><table><tbody><tr><td></td><th>  solution 1 </th><th>  solution 2 </th></tr><tr><th>  positive criterion 1 </th><td>  Plus Solutions 1 </td><td>  Plus Solutions 2 </td></tr><tr><th>  positive criterion 2 </th><td>  Plus Solutions 1 </td><td>  Plus Solutions 2 </td></tr><tr><th>  negative criterion 1 </th><td>  Minus Solution 1 </td><td>  Minus Solution 2 </td></tr><tr><th>  negative criterion 2 </th><td>  Minus Solution 1 </td><td>  Minus Solution 2 </td></tr></tbody></table><br></li></ol><br><br>  Not in all cases it will be convenient to use the table of advantages and disadvantages in this form.  As another example, take the choice of a cloud service, for example, CRM. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/114/b60/75d/114b6075dac5f648a02e5bb924552ac6.png" alt="image"><br><br>  In the first line we write the names of the services, in the second - their pluses, and in the third - the minuses.  In this case there will be strictly positive or strictly negative points, summarized in the ‚ÄúTotal‚Äù line. <br><br>  The developed model is easy to use and does not require much time for registration, and the necessary solution is immediately apparent. <br><br>  In conclusion, I want to say that it was thanks to this model that I decided to start a startup.  She also became its main part. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/211282/">https://habr.com/ru/post/211282/</a></p>
