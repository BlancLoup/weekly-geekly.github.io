  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Android DSD - prospects and existing solutions</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The data collection terminal is inherently a portable small computer with which a person receives tasks and reports on their implementation.  Most often they are used in warehouses and courier services. <br><br>  Until recently, all terminals went mainly with the Windows operating system (CE, Mobile, etc.).  And only recently, models with the Android OS began to appear.  Below are my thoughts on the prospects of this direction. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/65e/136/8de/65e1368de6ec4248acd8d8e0096eb731.jpg">

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  On any TSD installed one or another operating system (DOS, Windows, Android).  And already in the operating system itself, the main working application is launched.  The more perfect the operating system, the more opportunities can be realized in the working application.  As an example - in Windows and Android there is an opportunity to work with graphics, unlike DOS. <br><br>  The share of the TSD running Android is currently very small.  Windows is quite firmly occupied this niche.  However, in recent years, the development of smartphones and tablets running the Android OS has been actively pursued.  The number of sold devices in the hundreds of millions.  The system is constantly being improved, improved and optimized.  Many applications have been written, including a number of programs for accounting for goods.  And these programs are freely available in the general storage - either free or worthy enough modest money. <br><br>  Moreover - 1C has released a mobile platform, which is now actively developing.  This fact opens up huge prospects for this direction. <br><br>  For the mass introduction of software for Android, only ‚Äúhardware‚Äù is missing.  Small companies can easily afford to use software on smartphones and tablets, but industrial solutions still require a barcode reader and a higher level of security of the device. <br>  Considering all the prospects of this direction, we can expect a flood of the market by terminals running Android in the near future. <br><br>  Let's compare two devices with different operating systems for a visual demonstration. <br><br>  For comparison, were selected TSD - Motorolla MC3190 under the control of Windows CE and Urovo V5000 running Android. <br><br>  Motorola MC 3190 <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b3a/718/f3d/b3a718f3dbd24e9b833bc795a953fe91.jpg"><br><br>  Urovo V5000 <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4a0/2b5/9ce/4a02b59cedff4f0b9497df61a7b62db9.jpg"><br>  Iron Overview: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/030/543/f62/030543f62ff94a2aba361c1999dd0ce3.png"><br><br>  <b>The price of the device</b> - according to Google, the Urovo devices are 30% cheaper than Motorola. <br>  <b>Software cost and licensing policy</b> - a lot depends on the specific solution.  Windows CE TSDs are typically licensed by PerDevice.  those.  you pay extra for each device separately software license. <br>  For our retail network, we have purchased a license for telnet terminal + license to connect to the server. <br>  Android does not have such a tough licensing policy, like Microsoft (at one time I was very surprised by the need to purchase a license for telnet for Win CE). <br>  When you buy through Google Play, you buy one license for all devices associated with this account. <br>  When developing on a mobile platform 1C: <br><ul><li>  Up to 50 devices licensing is not required, </li><li>  More than 50 - you need to contact 1C and resolve the issue individually. </li></ul><br><br>  <b>Repair</b> - Despite the protection of the terminal breakdown thing is quite common.  Motorola has no problems with service centers and warranty.  Parts are almost always and almost unlimited.  Android terminals still cannot boast of this, although service centers are already opening. <br><br>  <b>Software development cost</b> (data taken from rabota.yandex.ru in Moscow) - 91,000 p.  - the average salary of the ‚Äúandroid‚Äù programmer, 82 000 p.  - The average salary of 1C programmer, 99 000 p.  -the average salary of a C # programmer (program for WinCE).  As we can see, the most economical option is to perplex the programmer to write a program for the TSD. <br><br>  <b>Manufacturer's</b> warranty - Motorola guarantees that their equipment will not be suddenly discontinued.  It is calculated that the device will be operated for at least 5 years.  Other manufacturers can not boast of this yet. <br><br>  <b>To summarize:</b> terminals on Android are very interesting for small and medium businesses.  They are cheaper, more productive, more secure, development is cheaper for them, there are many inexpensive box solutions, they can receive software updates centrally (which is especially important if it is updated frequently, and the devices are scattered over remote objects), they have many additional options (camera, 3g module, sim card, etc.) <br><br>  However, their use in serious ‚Äúenterprise‚Äù solutions is still difficult - there are no statistics for mass use, almost no service centers, there may be problems with spare parts and existing software systems are not yet configured for their use. <br><br>  PSwith the help of such bar code readers now you can quickly turn your smartphone into a TSD.  :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/03a/08c/4ee/03a08c4eead2470da1af53fe7232e660.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f41/518/75a/f4151875a58b4cf796a598bb320b6d25.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/291306/">https://habr.com/ru/post/291306/</a></p>
