    <h5>  <font color="#f04c40">1. Frames are not for us!</font> </h5><br>  This is not at all a mistake, but a fact!  Let us reveal a terrible secret: almost everyone who sent us a resume, put a note "creative."  Although the choice was, and it was possible to use the "business", for example.  What does this mean?  That you, as job seekers, feel that employers' requests are changing.  Now the black and white (or even black and blue: D) resume does not suit anyone: neither you nor the HR specialists.  You are a person, you can have a unique, beautiful, interesting resume, in which you will convey not only information about yourself, but also emotion, your view of the world.  It is wonderful.  Therefore, we will proceed from the fact that we do not ordinary summaries, but those that emphasize you and your merits.  Go! <br><br><h5>  <font color="#f04c40">2. ‚ÄúSoviet-like‚Äù registered name (+ date of birth)</font> </h5><br>  Of course, it all depends on the company and the position for which you are applying for a resume.  If this is an entry level position, then this advice will definitely be available at.  Try to avoid formalities and the "Soviet" approach.  It is better not to write Ivan Ivanovich Ivan, but to write Ivan Ivan Ivanov.  You can include a middle name when it is really necessary: ‚Äã‚Äãfor example, if you immediately apply for a management position in a Russian company (Ivan Ivanovich Ivanov).  And yet, be more democratic, it is always welcome.  If you create a resume in English, then it is better to avoid mentioning the middle name.  Date of birth should be specified, but do not focus on her attention. <br><br><h5>  <font color="#f04c40">3. Lack of specific information about the desired position</font> </h5><br>  In Russian practice, the graph is not too widespread yet, but it seems to us that this can be quite a useful innovation, a trend that you are shaping here and now.  Why?  Firstly, it is useful for you.  The formulation of the desired position is a clear awareness of your place in the company structure and what you are striving for.  Secondly, it allows the employer to instantly navigate and understand how you are ambitious, serious, how educated you are (you will not take a position from the ceiling, right?).  This is an important, almost key aspect.  However, difficulties may arise here, since the desired position does not always correspond to an open vacancy and you must be ready for adjustment.  If you still do not want to risk and you would like to avoid loud statements about yourself, then indicate the scope of your professional activity, for example, psychology, marketing, education, and so on.  Immediately identify who you are.  It is always helpful. <br><br><h5>  <font color="#f04c40">4. ‚ÄúLost‚Äù contact details</font> </h5><br>  Very important graph.  It should always be.  Is always.  In the most prominent place.  It can be located in the upper right corner, under your name, but only not at the very bottom - no one will once again look for your contacts.  What should I say?  You can start from the city to immediately drop all questions.  We write: "Moscow", "Serpukhov" - everything is clear, the phone (better without home, 21st century in the yard!), Then email, and then links to your pages on social networks.  Whether you like it or not, today these things have become the norm and can even help you when looking for work.  Do not neglect this.  Specify a link to a page on Facebook - this is considered more presentable, and then VK (you can also on Twitter, if you see fit).  Learn how to use the VKontakte page for job search, you can from us. <br><br><h5>  <font color="#f04c40">5. Still a student?</font> </h5><br>  We are sure that you studied at school and finished it with dignity, but we do not advise you to indicate this.  Immediately proceed to higher education, if any.  Do not forget about the reverse chronological order: master's, then bachelor (the last education is always indicated in the first place).  What you need to select?  The university that you graduated if its name says something to your employer and your specialty (How does it sound? For example, a public relations specialist.)  Be sure to specify the end years.  If you have more than one higher education, still indicate all your merits.  You will immediately see that you are an educated person with a broad outlook.  This is wonderful. <br><br><h5>  <font color="#f04c40">6. Experience 1.5 weeks</font> </h5><br>  If you can not boast of experience in a particular area and you have had many internships that did not end with a job, it is not necessary to list them all.  List those where you actually got some work experience.  You should not waste your time on trifles: 1.5 weeks in a company with a big name are unlikely to bring you much benefit.  Describe the places where you not only wore coffee.  It must be something you really want to talk about at the interview.  Even if you worked for a short time, then surely there will be something that you DID.  Please pay attention!  Not ‚ÄúDO‚Äù, but ‚ÄúDONE‚Äù.  Write about the merits of the project, the creation of a database - everything that has a specific result.  In general, do not try to create the appearance of a great work experience.  Specifying 5 jobs for half a year, you just lose your chances (unless it was not a project work). <br><br><h5>  <font color="#f04c40">7. I own MS Office</font> </h5><br>  Very controversial ability.  On the one hand, there are professions in which the use of SOME (not MS Word / PowerPoint) software package is necessary.  Proficiency in them is simply an important requirement.  In this case, you must indicate that you own Microsoft Query, for example.  It is necessary to focus on this.  But, if ... you just know how to make presentations, make tables, then it‚Äôs better to exclude this item from the summary.  Understand that almost everyone (95%, okay) who is looking for work, can send an email, knows how to use some programs from the MS Office package.  This is taught in school.  This is the basic skill of any modern employee.  The best indicate the program, which can not use all that may not even be too much can be useful to you during work.  If you have already decided to prove your PC skills, write, for example, Adobe Illustrator, Corel Draw and so on.  Originality is welcome. <br><br><h5>  <font color="#f04c40">8. Ai Speake Inglish</font> </h5><br>  In general, here we can only advise one thing: be honest.  If you have any certificates (not necessarily even IELTS or TOEFL) confirming your level of language, be sure to mention them.  It is advisable to indicate not ‚Äúfluent‚Äù, but to write a degree as is customary in the language system: C2, for example.  Do not indicate Russian, if it is obvious that this is your native language. <br><br>
<h5>  <font color="#f04c40">9. Cutting and sewing courses</font> </h5><br>  It will be great if you indicate which courses you attended.  For example, if you have completed advanced training courses, mastered an important program for your position and received a certificate, underwent training on corporate culture, are familiar with the basic concepts in psychology.  Online courses, of course, will also be reckoned.  Therefore, do not be lazy to require certificates - it will benefit you.  Specify only what says about you as a person striving for career and personal growth.  It is not necessary to write about dancing, the ability to embroider a cross (for this there is a controversial section "About Me" or "Hobby").  Yes, you yourself understand. <br><br><h5>  <font color="#f04c40">10. Selfies</font> </h5><br>  Refrain from photos in your resume if they do not conform to the format "business photo".  Of course, it all depends on the company, resume style, but be careful: the photo can spoil the impression a lot. <br><br><h5>  <font color="#f04c40">10.5.</font>  <font color="#f04c40">And here is the video to fix the material::</font> </h5><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/h329FJ3hUgs%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjUAth0DQ1zCIQd_h_6ibpZRmcETg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  PS In order to prevent these unpleasant errors - use our <a href="http://icanchoose.ru/resume">resume designer</a> , which also presents tips and tricks for its preparation, but in a more concise form. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/292162/">https://habr.com/ru/post/292162/</a></p>
