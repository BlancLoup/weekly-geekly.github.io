  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Circle Arduino and not only</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Having familiarized myself with the experience of various teachers in teaching schoolchildren the basics of programming, including at Habr√©, I decided to add my 5 kopecks.  Working at school for the 4th year, for two years I have been trying to engage in technical creativity with schoolchildren.  It all started with a radio receiving station and an intraschool radio. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/941/744/c35/941744c356cfecc98df769c5cfacb7c3.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Then there were experiments with electroforming on self-made power supply.  Repair of ancient school computers.  Later, on the advice of one of the students, I bought the first Arduino Uno and a sound sensor for my money.  And off you go.  First, like everyone else, a diode, then a relay.  Having examined the old printer, they began to play with the engines.  The school has Lego kits, but I believe that they are no longer suitable for projects of the 10-11 grade level and are still waiting for their time. <br><br>  The first serious project was a meteorological robot station, assembled on the knee of everything that was at hand. Remains of a printer, plexiglas from old broken stands, controlled by a remote control from a projector from my computer room.  The robot collected information about temperature, humidity and precipitation with the determination of their type and transmitted data through the RF module to the computer.  We won a number of contests with him.

Just last week, we arrived from Roboart in Voronezh.  Where also became the winners of the exhibition. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/290/af7/22e/290af722e71bddd4a6d2a26f42e5e656.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In April, we plan to go to Tambov to the robotic festival. <br><br>  It is extremely sad that in our region, as in fact, in most regions, robotics at school is synonymous with LEGO, or at best Fishertechnics.  Although arduino is cheaper and more interesting. <br><br>  Kits Arduino in schools is not there.  I acquired everything for my own circle, for my own money (thanks to my wife for having endured it).  At one of the sites, the guys helped to raise money for the soldering station (thank you very much), and then they pay 500 rubles for a circle, and I spend about 2,000 of my own.  I try to make the guys grow up in terms of programming and electrical engineering. <br><br>  At first it was uno, then the assembly of its own boards, the programming of the ‚Äúbare‚Äù controller, recently acquired the Raspberry PI.  Starting with Processing, we switched to a full-fledged SI: <br><br>  A week ago, a code lock was assembled on tmega8, with an actuator of the car‚Äôs central locking system. <br><br>  We are also currently working on the implementation of automatic all-wheel drive on a wheeled robot for another competition. <br><br>  Guys who have any unnecessary electronic components - I will be glad to help, because I have already exhausted my reserves.  And to buy, unfortunately, the teaching salary does not allow much. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/252351/">https://habr.com/ru/post/252351/</a></p>
