At the same time, site visitors were forwarded to a pornographic Internet resource. <br><br>  The case has continued.  In the beginning of this year, the prosecutor of Ingushetia submitted an application to the judicial authorities of the republic ‚Äúabout the termination of the electronic media - Ingushetia.Ru website‚Äù.  This statement, according to the text of the telegram received by the owner of the domain name of the site Evloev M.Ya., by the Ingush Supreme Court was either rejected or a decision was made to leave it without consideration.  The decision of the Supreme Court of the Republic of Ingushetia by the Prosecutor of the Republic of Ingushetia has been appealed to the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation. <br><br>  On the morning of March 18, the Supreme Court of Russia began a court hearing on a private complaint by the prosecutor of Ingushetia about the determination of the Supreme Court of Ingushetia about returning because of the lack of jurisdiction of the statement of the prosecutor of Ingushetia on the termination of the site Ingushetia.Ru.

      From the <a href="http://www.supcourt.ru/card/CASES.php%3FCASE_ID%3D20305836%26DELO_ID%3D15">information on the case on the website of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation</a> it follows that the case is referred to the category ‚ÄúSuspension and termination of activities of public organizations, parties in connection with extremist activities‚Äù. <br><br>  In the Supreme Court of Russia, the Ingushetia.Ru website is represented by the chief editor Roza Malsagova, one of the leaders of the Ingush youth organization Heritage Kaloy Akhilgov, and a lawyer acting on behalf of the owner of the site Evloev M.Ya. <br><br>  And just now, <a href="http://echo.msk.ru/">Ekho Moskvy</a> radio reported that the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation rejected the request of the Ingush prosecutor‚Äôs office to shut down the Ingushetia.Ru site. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  This is how Magomed Yevloyev, the site owner, comments on the current situation ( <a href="http://www.ingushetiya.ru/news/13666.html">source</a> ): <br><br>  - Is the requirement of the Ingushetia Prosecutor to close the site valid? <br><br>  - Of course not.  The statement of the Prosecutor of the Republic of Ingushetia was returned by the Supreme Court of Ingushetia in connection with lack of jurisdiction.  The court indicated that the application for closing the site should be submitted at the place of its registration.  The site Ingushetia.Ru is not registered in Russia.  In addition, it is not electronic or print media, it does not have a corresponding certificate, and the prosecutor‚Äôs attempts to link it to the laws ‚ÄúOn Mass Media‚Äù and ‚ÄúOn Countering Extremist Activities‚Äù are unfounded.  The prosecutor, in fact, has gone beyond his competence and demands to close an Internet resource operating on the international Internet and located physically in another state. <br><br>  - Why are there so many scandals around the site all the time, and the Ingush authorities are constantly trying to close it? <br><br>  - Only because the site objectively covers the situation in the region.  True, the current authorities are not satisfied.  Ingushetia is the only region in Russia where, in violation of the current legislation, at the direction of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Ingushetia, based on Zyazikov's request, local providers have denied access to Ingushetia.ru.  At the same time, there is access to sites that promote armed resistance and violence.  The Ingushetiya.Ru website does not violate the laws of the Russian Federation, operates within the framework of the Constitution of the Russian Federation, therefore it cannot be called extremist.  High site traffic bothers Ingush bribe takers and Zyazikov.  Their affairs and actions are always in sight of the people, at any time on the site may appear a particular message about unseemly behavior, corruption.  Therefore, almost the entire bureaucratic army of Ingushetia is in favor of its closure.  In addition, the site informs about every extrajudicial murder, abduction and other violations of human rights.  In this case, the interests of law enforcement bodies are already affected.  And they, too, ganged up against the site. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/21898/">https://habr.com/ru/post/21898/</a></p>
