  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why develop electronic meeting minutes for Sharepoint 2013</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> The previous article on the integration of Sharepoint-based projects received quite an interesting response.  And according to numerous requests for e-mail, I was asked to continue my literary work. <br><br>  Today I will try to show something interesting from the field of former implementations in the field of Sharepoint 2013 in our company. <br>  I will not make comparisons with various mastodons in the field of EDS, I will simply describe and show the implementation of the example of one of the improvements for Sharepoint 2013 on the basis of Worklite Docs, which will be of interest to those who suffer. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  In essence, what is the <a href="http://www.sharepoint-project.ru/electroniy-documentooborot.html">SED Electronic Document Management</a> , if in simple human language? <br>  SED - (if you do not focus on the little things) - this is the same system for monitoring the execution of instructions in relation to documents, that is, storing and moving documents in tasks within the company under a huge amount of conditions.  It is rude to say so - but the truth is, not Africa.  Such a system - allows managers and ordinary employees to greatly simplify many routine paperwork and engage in their direct responsibilities - to drink coffee, to crack corporate buns and sit in Odnoklassniki all the way with the expectation of sucking traffic jams on the Garden.

      Even a rather exotic implementation, for example, the minutes of meetings in the annex to the SED, can make it possible to transfer quite trivial things to the level above, requiring close attention and collecting heterogeneous information at the moment of discussing something. <br>  After all, like in our company, for example, it looks like a mediocre discussion of incomprehensible things, let‚Äôs say about buying or implementing some kind of scary, but very necessary system, device, gadget? <br><br>  Moreover, I have a strong suspicion that approximate episodes and illustrations occur in very many companies.  And it is quite possible that even third-party types and opinions will be very similar to the ones described below. <br><br>  So, it looks like this approximately in the following form (the number and positions of those present may vary): <br><br>  ... <br><br>  <i>The office of the CEO with a long polished table, and a bunch of various letters and certificates on the wall.</i>  <i>In the room sits a few people from completely different areas of the organization.</i>  <i>At the head of the table, in a high leather chair, sits Boris Trofimovich.</i>  <i>In some distance on both sides of the table - the staff are sitting.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>The heterogeneity of their activities - they virtually resemble a gang of Makhnovists.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>On the left is the accountant - radiant Zinaida Tikhonovna, then clockwise - Oleg Viktorovich (head of the IT department), two assistants with a dull facial expression - also from IT - Lesha and Zhenya (surnames unknown), Olga Konstantinovna - personnel, then a systems analyst - a young man with an imperturbable bronze tan and closes the circle Vladislav Petrovich - head of the AXO department (he is extremely far from high technologies, but always invariably present at all important meetings - since this is the tradition).</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>From those who are absent, but expected: Deputy Director, Head of the Procurement Division, and a partner of the system analyst.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>The voice of Levitan to declare war, of course, the General takes the first word:</i> <i><br></i>  <i>‚ÄúDear colleagues, it's the 21st century and we just have to keep up with the times.</i>  <i>(slowly, with a steel look, it leads around all those present) Our company dynamically develops and confidently holds its position in the market.</i>  <i>There is an opinion that we need to automate the work of business processes and facilitate the implementation of routine tasks. ‚Äù</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>... A premonition of mischief curled in the air.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Zinaida Tikhonovna‚Äôs gaze turned radiant into an enthusiastic, the IT chief nodded knowingly, depressions expressed on the faces of the assistants, and Vladislav Petrovich the Chief of the Administrative Department fished a handkerchief from the trousers that resembled a ship weather vane from a distance and blew out loudly.</i>  <i>The person of the system analyst obviously possessed the emotions of an Indian - he did not blink an eye.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>"... In this regard, I suppose that we will need to work out a strategy for the scope of work, the development of a technical assignment and the distribution of duties between our technical specialists for interaction with the development company on the choice of which we will dwell. What opinions, colleagues?"</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>It was impossible to assume the worst.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>An enthusiastic expression was replaced by a mute adoration and Zinaida Tikhonovna‚Äôs shrewd-like body trembled with joyful emotions overwhelming her.</i>  <i>"Right.</i>  <i>Boris Trofimovich, I have been saying this to you for a long time.</i>  <i>After all, it was impossible to work.</i>  <i>Need to do something.</i>  <i>All the more so since the young guys are smart, and they will have experience and the company will just go into the trends of new trends. ‚Äù</i>  <i>Having spoken this speech with a look, Joan of Arc, the caretaker of new trends with a sense of deep satisfaction put on her glasses and began to dig diligently in the voluminous folder with documents only of her clear origin.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>The following was taken by the head of the IT department:</i> <i><br></i>  <i>‚ÄúI propose to transfer the discussion to a constructive course and determine the necessary" wishes "- which are necessary for implementation within the framework of our project." Victoriously examines those present.</i>  <i>"I have prepared a short list of the required functionality, please express your comments."</i>  <i>With a nimble hand movement, the information technology guard blew onto the table a tetra of 48 sheets, where in the hand of a man of complex fate, multiple lines with unruly text were displayed.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Dreary assistants have grown gloomy.</i>  <i>The expression of an Indian-system analyst turned into a copper bust of Caesar, while Vladislav Petrovich, the Head of the Operations Department, blew his nose into a weather vane.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>The loud baritone Olga Konstantinovna, the head of the personnel department, thundered first!</i>  <i>‚ÄúPlease note that it is imperative for our department to implement the following: ..‚Äù</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>... enumeration, comments, approval, arguments and shouts were heard until late at night.</i>  <i>The guard was already nodding, and Aunt Zina, the cleaning lady, shaking her head tiredly, long ago, she wore a rag under the raised legs of those present, and even several times poured water noisily with a silent hint "Like, when you finally go home, exploiters!"</i> <i><br></i> <br>  ... <br><br>  This is what I am for?  At a certain point (in the above case), such a feature as the ‚ÄúElectronic Protocol of Meetings‚Äù can play a role - this is not exactly an element of the EDS, it is rather a pure piece of the system for executing orders.  While it is interesting - for some strange whim of fate, very few people even know about the existence of this.  Some are implementing it at Sharepoint 2010, some already at Sharepoint 2013, but the essence does not change, the main thing is that there are no such situations as I described in the last post about <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/179731/">customer errors when implementing systems based on Sharepoint 2013</a> <br><br>  Visually looks something like this, respectively, the design and appearance, this you already decide for yourself, will surely be in accordance with the corporate style.  To whom it is interesting, we implemented the 365 with the pre-installed Sharepoint 2013 on the Microsoft cloud, but please note that there are more nuances than the roof: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4bb/73e/cec/4bb73ecec40b76b280441ea9d8bf8737.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  At the time of filling out the protocol, they are set on the basis of the same protocol - the tasks of the participants and employees.  It can be as a multiple hierarchy (that is, with subtasks to performers) - and a simple implementation, one task - one performer.  To do this, you need to fill in this block (the number of performers is unlimited: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e49/5b5/5c6/e495b55c6287a5504fbab3b267d069ca.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Well and on an exhaust we receive listing of the filled protocol with marks about execution, and we send the next protokl to electronic storage. <br>  Then it is very convenient to view, comment, and generally poke a sharp stick at the employees who refuse their words in the style of ‚ÄúI mean something not at all meant‚Äù or ‚ÄúYou did not understand me correctly, I see you for the first time‚Äù. <br><br>  Professionals in the field of developing such things at Sharepoint - this is unlikely to be necessary, but users may well find it helpful to understand that such features take place in implementation. <br><br>  Additional chips can be viewed in <a href="http://www.sharepoint-project.ru/box-250.php">Worklite Office</a> solutions <a href="http://www.sharepoint-project.ru/box-250.php">.</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/180517/">https://habr.com/ru/post/180517/</a></p>
