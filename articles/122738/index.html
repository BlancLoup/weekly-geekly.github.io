  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Advertising for your Android application</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h4>  Advertising advertising or how to make money on your application </h4><br>  I have no great experience in developing applications for Android.  But in this article I will share my experience in communicating with various advertising delivery systems.  For those that we used, I will cite various graphics. <br><br>  Well, let's go. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  Little about the application </h5><br>  To get in the course of the case I will give here some information about the application.  Here is a <a href="https://market.android.com/details%3Fid%3Dru.oophone.my.mood">link</a> to the application in the Web Market.  The application was the first experience in the market, so do not judge strictly.  We did not carry out any advertising of the application, except that we posted several posts on thematic forums.  In the future, on the promotion of the application just did not spend a penny. <br>  Some statistics that honestly surprised us a little.  The release of the application took place on March 27 of this year.  We did not expect a large number of races, to whom some widget is actually interesting, which simply puts a smiley on the screen and a signature.  Download statistics for today looks like this: <br>  Total Downloads: 129210 <br>  Installations: 40687 (31%) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/593/e47/b71/593e47b71a8711fe12f320679b5006c1.jpg"><br><br><h5>  How to make money </h5><br>  In fact, about a month after the release of the first version, we were interested in how to get at least some income from our application.  And just do it really. <br>  Since we did not see the point in making the paid version, because there is nothing to pay there.  They started thinking about advertising (yes, any tricks in the form of a button, donate us $ 1 work poorly - checked). <br>  Advertising.  Which advertising provider to choose?  Where can I make more money, and where to get bored users.

      <br>
    <h6>  Mobclix </h6><br>  Probably many have heard about this system.  As an example I will give the graphics of our application: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0e5/f66/448/0e5f664489688542aaca82857df7f1bc.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/941/112/0e7/9411120e70aa493a80f8ab3f29ac6562.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7dd/774/ca4/7dd774ca4b80175bb26276194ecac2ea.png"><br>  In total, we earned 1000 rubles a month from advertising from <a href="http://www.mobclix.com/">Mobclix</a> .  Which of course is not very much.  And this despite the fact that the number of active users is constantly growing. <br>  I am pleased with the fact that Mobclix provides in the admin panel viewing of application usage statistics, user growth, number of applications openings.  And all this can be viewed even by the hour. <br>  Working as a whole with the Mobclix system is very easy.  The SDK is easy to use (quick start will help), banners are connected in the admin panel, there you can also select ad networks that will deliver advertising (I apologize for the tautology), size and other parameters.  With regards to the withdrawal of money, everything is not so simple.  Although everyone has a favorite Direct Deposit, but you have to wait until the withdrawal for about a month, then the withdrawal happens every two days.  The amount is paid by the way parts.  Why?  In fact, it looks like the fact that Mobclix itself must receive money from other sources and only then pay the developer.  Oh, and they have a terrible web interface ... <br><br><h6>  Scaring users - Airpush </h6><br>  Well, since for some reason we didn‚Äôt feel sorry for the users, we decided to check out other types of advertising.  So to say a study.  Many unloved <a href="http://www.airpush.com/">Airpush</a> came <a href="http://www.airpush.com/">across</a> .  The point is quite simple: advertising comes in the form of a notification on your phone.  Honestly, if I had such an application, I would delete it right away.  But interest prevailed and we put this system in our application.  And now to the numbers. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ba9/9a4/f50/ba99a4f503c83590fb7dcdac386206f5.png"><br>  The numbers impressed us.  CPM ~ 4 $.  Fill Rate is pretty high at ~ 95%.  But there is no such freebie.  Free only cheese in a mousetrap.  This ad scares users very well.  Therefore, before you put this ad, think carefully.  For we got angry reviews in the market. <br>  So now more about withdrawal.  There is one nuance.  Everything is the same as always - we choose direct transfer to a bank account.  But the translation is carried out only in a month.  Those.  in our example: earning $ 200 in May  You will receive them only after June 30th. <br>  By the way, there are quite a few options for getting ads by users.  You can take a break between notifications, choose how many notifications a user will receive per day, and so on. <br>  The SDK is easy to install.  It is worth noting that when using this advertising delivery system, the application acquires a lot of unnecessary permissions (do not forget to add them to the manifest when connecting this system).  This can serve as another push for a cautious user not to install such an application.  Although to be honest, none of my friends who own Androids pay attention to permissions. <br><br><h6>  Finally a few more </h6><br>  C AdMob we did not work, somehow did not work.  Therefore, I can not say something specific.  But judging by the reviews impressions ambiguous.  I would advise you to try both Admob and Mobclix, and see what happens. <br>  There are some more interesting decisions on the advertising market, for example, <a href="http://www.leadboltapps.com/web/">such</a> . <br><br><h5>  At the end </h5><br>  I would like to say that it is real to earn money on Android applications.  Advertising is able to generate income.  Having a few pretty popular applications you can earn and not so little. <br><br>  All success in the development!  Thanks for attention.  I will be glad to questions, comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/122738/">https://habr.com/ru/post/122738/</a></p>
