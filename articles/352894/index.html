And it's not a joke</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  While all over the world they were joking about white backs, new logos of old football clubs and letting the April Fools' ducks ‚Äúswim‚Äù, here they were creative, generated, presented and, of course, coded.  The teams spent the weekend creating projects in JavaScript - this was the only condition for participation in the FrontSpot hackathon organized by the frontend community of Minsk.  All the rest is improvisation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/55f/f0e/54a/55ff0e54a3452e7a70065947a93d846f.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  FrontSpot community appeared in Minsk EPAM almost 2 years ago and gradually attracted like-minded people from the outside.  A narrow circle of like-minded people started, as usual, and now there are already over a thousand users in the SLACK community chat.  The guys spend tech talks, meetings, release a weekly digest.  And finally, ‚Äúgrown up‚Äù to the hakaton. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/37a/db9/798/37adb979835888b8c40bc566ba5208e7.jpg" alt="image">

Everyone who wanted to spend the first weekend of April to develop non-trivial ideas and win prizes - tickets to developer conferences and certificates for online training - was invited to the coding marathon.  Spoiler: freshmen won. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/29b/d1b/807/29bd1b8073c6ae0e249f63e056b4c41a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/73c/017/759/73c0177597c578abad6cd28933f3e498.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/aaa/75c/592/aaa75c5925e2a5031af8340c220429f0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b76/a54/e87/b76a54e874840e983fde6c76095b8af8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Recently, hackathons are very popular, they are held at different sites and on different topics.  We decided to combine two ideas - to gather a small group of like-minded people for a very warm and lamp event without hiring, recruiting and all these marketing things, and more actively speaking about the community to the outside world.  And so it happened. ‚Äù, - organizers Yegor Myasnikov, Maxim Yuzva and Pavel Yukhnovich unanimously comment on the main idea and goal of the hackathon. <br><br>  The teams presented their projects on the evening of April 1.  The jury, however, assessed them according to serious criteria: originality and viability of the idea, persuasiveness of the presentation and implementation of the project during the hackathon (24 hours). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/023/683/c00/023683c000bfd967457c1db7d7106e68.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7c5/4c5/542/7c54c5542dc4a9a3b084b6e99001e9e9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/80f/0aa/f46/80f0aaf4676c4fa73ca5d90fa58c1fe2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Very often, hackathons win projects that have no global significance and, frankly, have no future.  As an organizer, we really wanted to win a socially significant idea, which is not just cool presented during the presentation, but could be useful for people in the future, the organizers say. <br><br>  <b>Fit4code command</b> <br><br>  On the hackathon, the guys created a wave-type shader.  The program was written on WebGL, rendered by a video card and got quite good performance.  Explaining how it works, the team talked a lot about noise, interpolation, mathematical models, and that‚Äôs all.  They demonstrated the effect of incident light reflected from water, using the example of water, stones and space. <br><br>  A shader can become a substrate on the site or a hider.  It works in Chrome, Mozilla and other omnibus modern browsers and does not ‚Äúslacken‚Äù the smartphone battery with active use - the judges of the jury reassured them. <br><br>  <b>Diet Cola Team</b> <br><br>  The guys tried to create an application that is relevant for people suffering from diabetes, as well as for those who care about their health and monitor their weight.  In addition to the calorie counter in the program, in the future, an insulin counter and a barcode reader will appear. <br><br>  After downloading the application, the user will be authorized by e-mail and password, will set their parameters and select the power program.  The project is written in Angular and Node.js. <br><br>  <b>FrontSpot command</b> <br><br>  A small but proud team consisting of one developer presented a project called ‚ÄúDon't forget the iron is on‚Äù - a web application that sends notifications to the user based on its geolocation. <br><br>  The potential scope of application is IoT.  Imagine getting out of the metro, and the service ‚Äúcatches‚Äù the location and sends a signal to the smart home system to turn on the electric kettle, download your favorite radio station, warm up the warm floor to your return or send a notice of discounts at a store nearby.  Beauty! <br><br>  <b>3rd place - Q Work team</b> <br><br>  One of the most charismatic presentations turned out this team.  Their project, a service that helps schoolchildren and students to find a part-time job in real time, was conceived in 2 hours on the hackathon.  We wrote a project in JS using Node.js and mongoDB. <br><br>  Looking at the site, the user will see a catalog with offers of quick money in different categories: dog walking, courier delivery, help with housekeeping, etc.  The guys added the option "radius": it will be possible to find work by location, tags and payment options. <br><br>  "Employers" were offered a quick authorization in the Telegram channel and a system of feedback on the work done.  They decided to monetize the service with the help of advertising and ‚Äúpercent‚Äù from the publication of orders.  Withdrawal of money left at the mercy of users - a credit card or blockchain via a wallet. <br><br>  As a prize for the 3rd place, all participants received certificates for online training on Frontend. <br><br>  <b>2 place - Ptt 3 force</b> <br><br>  Thanks to this team, the hackathon received international status, because 50 percent of its participants come from Belarus, and the second 50 from Bashkiria.  The guys came to Minsk to visit friends and decided to spend time with fun and benefit (as usually happens in FrontSpot J). <br><br>  The presented application - Potato Party - will help users organize a spontaneous meeting or party.  Or do it yourself.  You fill a simple profile - age, interests, hobbies, and the application, based on the data and location of the user, selects meetings according to interests. <br><br>  For example, you decided to try pizza, but do not want to sit alone - click on the button and the automatic invitation will go to all lovers of Italian cuisine in the area, and you will have to share the link in the social.  networks to invite friends.  And if there are a lot of country fans or Python near you, the application will independently organize a meeting for Python and country fans and invite everyone to the meeting. <br><br>  In perspective, add chat rooms to the application for different locations and rating of participants. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThere is no Rocket Science here,‚Äù the guys admit, the project was implemented on React Native, Golang, PostgreSQL. <br><br>  Immediately after the hackathon, a part of the team went home to Bashkortostan, but soon the guys would get together again at the You Gotta Love Frontend conference in Kiev, which the team won tickets to take second place. <br><br>  <b>Winner: HotSpot team and Save your Life project</b> <br><br>  The team project is an educational game for toddlers and children of primary school age.  Her goal is to teach children simple rules of behavior in emergency situations and possible consequences of ignoring or ignorance of these rules. <br><br>  According to the developers, the game will solve the problem of the lack of qualified personnel in working with children.  For example, in schools, the subject matter of life skills is not taught by emergency workers, and class teachers often do not have the necessary information.  Rescuers in this case have to deal with the consequences, and not with their warning. <br><br>  So, the user enters the game.  The first step is to choose a situational scenario.  For example, you got lost in the forest or fell in bad weather.  Once in an open area in a thunderstorm, the man in the game must find the safest place and take shelter from the weather.  If the player makes the wrong choice, a hint appears on the screen with a detailed explanation of the error. <br><br>  In the future, the development of a mobile application and the promotion of the project in state institutions, Belarusian youth public organizations of young firefighters-rescuers, scouts and installation of programs in computer science classes and on the website of the Ministry of Emergency Situations. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt sleep all night, we drew the game,‚Äù admits the team, 3 of whose 4 participants were on the hackathon for the first time.  All the guys are first-year students. They will continue to pump their knowledge at the HolyJS conference in St. Petersburg. <br><br>  The plans of the FrontSpot community are new meetings and new meeting formats, watch for announcements in the community group in FB. <br><br>  Hackathon was supported by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/EPAM.Belarus/%3Fref%3Dbookmarks">EPAM Belarus</a> , <a href="">You Gotta Love Frontend Kyiv</a> , <a href="https://holyjs.ru/">JavaScript conference Holyjs in St. Petersburg</a> , <a href="https://www.facebook.com/beerjsminsk/">Beerjs Minsk</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/webnotbombs/">Web Not Bombs</a> , <a href="http://html5.by/">HTML5.by</a> , <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MinskJS/">MinskJS</a> , <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/4front/about/">4Front</a> and <a href="https://frontendmasters.com/">FrontendMasters</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/352894/">https://habr.com/ru/post/352894/</a></p>
