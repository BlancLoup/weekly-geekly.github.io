  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Attitudes of companies towards you: what should it be?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello friends.  I have a couple of very important questions for all of you, the answers to which will be interesting to find out not only and not so much to myself, but to those companies that are so diligently trying to please you and me with their goods and services, often, by the way, too much. <br><br>  As you know, we are all part of the modern consumer society and every day, even hourly, we are confronted with the fact that we are in some way offered, served or stupidly impose certain goods and services of thousands of various IT companies.  From this you can not escape, this is the modern world, blah blah blah.  At the same time, we too (in any case, those who read these lines on Habr√©) become smarter and more sophisticated, and if yesterday they were peering at the ‚Äújeans‚Äù without any hesitation, then today we even treat well-organized viral campaigns with a fair share suspicions.  And this is good.  It‚Äôs good because now we, as someone‚Äôs target audience, are less and less reckoned to be ‚Äúordinary citizens‚Äù, and companies need to work hard to make quality contact with us and get the necessary return.  All this leads to the fact that very advanced companies do not bomb us with stupid advertising, but they almost personally meet us, try to establish direct communication (for example, some companies that we have in Habr√© in the corporate section do this), trying to better understand for whom they work their work.  On the other hand, there are many companies that do not understand that the audience has become wiser and does not take this into account in their work, which, in turn, causes the appearance of idiotic advertising, strange products, stupid services and other garbage. <br><br>  Actually, what I am all about.  A huge request: tell in more detail what you like and, most importantly, what you do not like in the behavior of modern IT-related companies?  What would you like to see their interaction with you: more interesting advertising, personal communication of representatives, actions, something else?  What annoys you most about their behavior?  Under what conditions do you want to use goods and services, and in what conditions - absolutely not?

      Everything you write will be read by representatives of dozens of modern companies, both domestic and foreign.  And, most importantly, all this will definitely be taken into account, and something will be put into service immediately.  As a result - all profit. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/64543/">https://habr.com/ru/post/64543/</a></p>
