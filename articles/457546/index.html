Our teams will show live demos, and you will be the first to see what is about to appear on the sale. <br><br>  In Raiffeisenbank we spend demo days every month, and we want not only to show the grocery part of this event, but also to tell and show you how this helps us to make the bank better. <br><br>  Now the topic of digital transformations is very relevant for many.  At each IT conference, everyone talks about their experiences and shares the challenges that were on the way.  Stories with digitalisations, transformations, adjectivization are really interesting, and companies face great difficulties, both technical and social, and cultural.

And how to do it when there is no clarity around, the teams have only been formed and are still trying to transfer tasks to each other, frightening with directive methods?  I'll tell you now. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1k/fy/pk/1kfypk9vdbj1s1fandzukbdux6k.png" width="600"></div><br><br>  One of the cool rituals in Scrum is to create a demo for customers.  Do not tell me how it usually happens.  Everything is decorous, we look at the product, we say where to fix it, and then quietly and peacefully disagree to work further.  Great.  It is clear to everyone what the team was doing, what is their role, who will make improvements, and the customer understands what is being done for him.  The fire is the same. <br><br>  Great event, why not borrow it?  When everything changes around you and it is not clear what is happening, the best thing you can do is to tell, closing the information vacuum.  So we decided to make a big internal open day demo. <br><br>  <b>What does this give us?</b> <br><br><ol><li>  <b>Transparency.</b>  Everyone can see the results of team work: both customers and those for whom these products are made </li><li>  <b>Feedback.</b>  You can ask a question or make a comment, and the team will receive valuable information from you. </li><li>  <b>Call.</b>  If you commit to performing for the whole bank (and this is one seventh of the Olympic Stadium), then you want to show something interesting, so the teams choose to go to the demo ambitious tasks. </li><li>  <b>The effect of team building</b> .  All team members are equally responsible for the product, so the boundaries between business and IT in the process of preparation are crumbling, and team communication is improving. </li><li>  <b>Glory and cookies</b> .  Our "mini-Olympic" now knows his characters by sight and understands what these bearded guys are doing in jeans for them.  We also give teams of pirozhenka for the performance. </li></ol><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/m1/78/je/m178jeolsqppvnvw2k2gs9qpzrg.jpeg" width="600"></div><br>  <b>Ok, that sounds cool.</b>  <b>And how to implement it all?</b> <br><br>  People are usually lazy.  They do not want to waste time just like that.  ‚ÄúI come here to write code, and not to go to rallies‚Äù - rightly so.  So they will say the team, if you do not explain why they all this.  Let's understand why: <br><br><ol><li>  No one understands who does what.  Your product on the market can be a rock star, but inside everyone is so mired in the outluck‚Äôs routine that no matter how much marketing a mailing list is written, no one will read it. </li><li>  Mini demo was.  Customers showed.  Customers praised.  Only users do not know, and how they worked in the old uncomfortable systems, they continue, because they do not know about the new ones. </li><li>  Even if everyone knows everything about everything, I often don‚Äôt understand the value of these or other improvements.  How much more money the bank saved, how the speed of working with certain data has changed, etc. </li></ol><br>  When the team hears these explanations, it really understands that there are such problems, and she has the motivation to talk about what they are doing. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zj/bw/li/zjbwlibi_62tpw28uwzbyc5c1ws.jpeg" width="600"></div><br>  <b>And then the matter of technology: to come up with the rules of the game and implement.</b> <br><br>  We decided that we would play like this: every month we organize a big demo day.  How big?  8-10 teams.  Each team is given one slot lasting 15 minutes.  10 minutes for the demo, 5 for questions.  As a result, we vote for the demo and call to speak next. <br><br>  <b>What can not:</b> <br><br>  You can not show presentations.  It is impossible.  Not at all.  Even one slide is impossible.  If you need to explain or show something, think how it can be done without a presentation.  And better show the product "before" and "after."  Some teams were creative and came with graphs on their T-shirts, on flipchart sheets, and even drew giant paper extracts.  It was much more efficient and interesting.  Now everyone in the bank understands what currency control is. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bd/_k/od/bd_kodeeng-jvxhtv7oikqf6f98.jpeg" width="600"></div><br>  <b>What is important:</b> <br><br>  It is important to speak in simple language.  The audience of the ‚Äúmini-Olympic‚Äù is people from completely different projects, teams and businesses.  Therefore, what teams show and tell, must be understood by everyone.  If commands introduce terminology, then explain it immediately. <br><br>  We ask to talk about the benefits and benefits that bring these changes.  How much life has become better.  It is very important. <br><br>  And we knew that it would not work by force.  Therefore, participation in the demo day is always voluntary.  For the year, each team takes part in the demo day, on average, 3-4 times. <br>  The ability to communicate with their users and customers allows the guys to see how much you can be useful and how important for people the work you do.  And you really get very nice and want to move mountains. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1-/6m/-y/1-6m-yu30dlmlyklkxxc44tyfqc.jpeg" width="600"></div><br>  For us, a demo day is always a holiday and a very valuable event.  We are ready to share this experience with you, and therefore we decided to step out of the shadows and show the best.  The program has the most juice: we will show what has just happened in production or hasn't even come out yet, but will roll out soon.  The rules of the demo remain the same as when we conduct them for ourselves.  No cheating. <br><br>  To participate in the event you must <a href="https://raiffeisen-events.timepad.ru/event/1004460/">register</a> . <br><br>  Come, it will be interesting! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/457546/">https://habr.com/ru/post/457546/</a></p>
