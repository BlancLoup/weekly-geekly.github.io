However, Internet marketers often do not fully understand this concept and do not know how it affects their work. <br>  User interface designers often collaborate with internet marketers.  Although the budget for both roles is usually allocated one - for "marketing", the responsibilities and the results of the work of these specialists differ significantly. <br>  <b>In this article, we describe the main aspects of the experience of user interaction and its impact on the work of Internet marketers.</b> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>1. User interaction is not only about the interface.</b> <br><br>  It is a mistake to believe that user interaction only consists in creating a beautiful interface.  Although it is important, but only a small part of a lengthy and time-consuming procedure (here it‚Äôs <a href="http://witget.com/blog/rejting-servisov-dlya-sozdaniya-prodayushhix-stranic/%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_campaign%3D30-12">about what services you should use if you are new to creating selling sites</a> ).  The step at which an interface design is created is called user interface design or interactive design.

      And this is only one aspect of the design process of user interaction. <br><br>  The process of user interaction is based on the relationship between people and technology.  Moreover, this phenomenon denotes the definition and design of these relationships.  The nature of this relationship is widely disclosed, due to the rapid development of modern digital technologies.  In the near future, this relationship will increase due to the obvious attachment of people to smartphones and tablets, which we constantly carry with us ( <a href="http://witget.com/blog/budushhee-uzhe-zdes-4-ad-texnologii-kotorye-vzorvut-vashu-konversiyu/%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_campaign%3D30-12">how to use technology to increase conversion</a> - here). <br><br>  <b>2. User interaction is associated with the product itself, and not with its advertising</b> <br><br>  The main difference between digital marketing and user interaction is the following: marketing makes people want a product, and design creates what people want. <br><br>  The design starts the process of interaction with the user, so the latter is more closely associated with the final type of product.  UI designers are known for their habit of asking many questions about product details.  Sometimes this creates difficulties in interacting with a team of marketers who are more focused on the growth of sales of a ready-made product provided to them.  At the same time, the developers of the user interaction process are associated with the digital marketing department and are often responsible for optimizing online campaigns. <br><br>  As a result, designers of the user interaction process expect the product to be in demand based on its availability to customers.  These valuable calculations will help internet marketers build an effective sales strategy (for impressive results, we must take into account the <a href="http://witget.com/blog/konversiya-sajta-10-sekretov-psixologii-potrebitelej-prezentaciya/%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_campaign%3D30-12">psychology of the consumer</a> ). <br><br>  <b>3. Interaction always happens - you only need to decide whether you need a design.</b> <br><br>  User interaction with the product occurs regardless of whether you took this process into account in the marketing plan or not.  Simply put, the strongest influence of marketing occurs outside the communication channels.  Namely - during the actual use of the goods, that is, the formation of a real consumer experience. <br><br>  Most marketing is focused on channels through which you can transfer information to customers: the press, the digital environment, mobile phones.  But the problem is that customers are ordinary people who have a need that your product can (or cannot!) Satisfy. <br><br>  And here's the catch: people do not have communication channels - they tend to live in the space between the channels.  More recently, this fact began to pay attention to the concept of cross-channels and universal sales channels.  But these concepts no longer work, since they are based on the logic of business and try to present the product as the company sees it, and not in the way that the consumer needs. <br><br>  These factors at the root undermine the attempts of marketers to sell the product, which provokes a decline in conversion, where it is necessary to take into account the design of the user interface.  Only the designer of the user interaction process will be able to restore the necessary balance.  By the way, there can not do without all sorts of <img src="http://witget.com/blog/oprosy-na-sajte-kak-interpretirovat-poluchennye-rezultaty/?utm_source=geek&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=29-12" alt="image">  polls. <br><br>  <b>4. The process of user interaction requires complex research approaches.</b> <br><br>  Marketing in the digital environment usually does not generate new ideas, based on various studies.  More often than not, all the studies that have been carried out come down to the interpretation of the general results of the standard marketing research program.  Marketing research is usually aimed at calculating the demand for the finished product on an already proven market, so they are almost always based on quantitative calculation methods. <br><br>  In contrast, the process of user interaction completely depends on research, which naturally focuses on finding and understanding the real needs of a person (in fact, searching for an answer to the question of <a href="http://witget.com/blog/opredelenie-schastya-klyuch-k-povysheniyu-konversii-o-kotorom-my-chasto-zabyvaem/%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_campaign%3D30-12">how to give happiness to the consumer</a> ).  And these needs can be met only by a well-designed product.  In this case, the methodology aimed at researching the design has a completely qualitative nature and is easily used in modeling problem situations, and can also be additionally measured by quantitative parameters. <br><br>  Both approaches organically complement each other and establish the ability of a new product to carry real value for consumers, and, as a result, to bring tangible profits to the company. <br><br>  <b>5. User interaction is categorized as modern internet marketing.</b> <br><br>  Controversial issue?  Maybe.  But this is an inevitable fact. <br>  Social networks have turned the entire concept of classic marketing upside down.  What was used as the main discipline for managing profits from broadcasting in the media has become the science of managing communication channels, coordinating dialogues on the Web and developing communities. <br><br>  As a result, companies have to create a truly valuable product for the consumer in order to retain their customers and attract new ones.  Many businessmen are still struggling with this phenomenon - it is impossible to buy good reviews for a bad product, in any case, social networks will immediately reveal the truth. <br><br>  What happens if not only people, but also products will become part of the social network?  At the dawn of the ‚ÄúInternet of Things‚Äù era, we are faced with even more striking changes - in the future, most interactions in social networks will occur between products or people and products, and not just between people, like now.  And marketing is already hard to cope with this phenomenon with the old methods. <br><br>  We cannot sell goods to inanimate things.  The availability of information in the era of the ‚ÄúInternet of Things‚Äù guarantees a fundamental shift in our understanding of technology and our relationship with them.  We will not be so easy to distance them, turn off or hide in your pocket. <br><br>  Interaction will be everywhere, it will be invisible and always included.  Therefore, the basic skills of digital marketing will be reduced to the ability to adapt to these changes and become part of the global communication of products and services.  More specifically, these skills will become the only important ones in the successful promotion of a well-designed product, and not additional, as part of an existing business proposal. <br><br>  It is during this period that the processes of interaction with the user will rapidly develop.  Since this discipline is related to people, not technology.  It is fully devoted to understanding people and the role that technology is called upon to play in their lives, as well as the study of ways of life to which they can lead. <br><br>  What do you think?  Are designers required to interact in digital marketing or is interaction only a well-executed internet marketing? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/364843/">https://habr.com/ru/post/364843/</a></p>
