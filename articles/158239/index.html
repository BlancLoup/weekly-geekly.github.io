  <section class="page js-page"><h1>About cameras and lenses</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On November 6, sales of new smartphones of the Lumia family, the Nokia Lumia 920 and 820, officially started in Russia. As you know, Nokia has been using Carl Zeiss optics in its smartphones for many years, whose very name guarantees quality.  The tradition of creating phones with built-in cameras, as they like to say now, turned out to be deep in our DNA - we are the largest camera manufacturer in the world.  And, as in the case of geolocation, we take this direction more than seriously.  Today we will talk about what the PureView in the Lumia 920 is and what Lenses are. <br><br>  So what is PureView?  This is not the name of the 41-megapixel sensor, as many could decide after the release of the Nokia 808 PureView.  PureView is a whole complex of hardware components and software solutions that allows you to make high-quality images. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6bd/5a4/00f/6bd5a400f75c1ec1698ad45e638a1786.jpg">

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The Lumia 920 uses a ‚Äúfloating‚Äù lens for image stabilization, paired with a gyroscope (called the OIS), a 1/3 inch sensor with a normal resolution of 8.7 megapixels and a 1.4 micron pixel size with BSI backlight technology ( Backside illumination) of a new generation, as well as, let's face it, a large f / 2.0 aperture.  In more detail we have already talked about these technologies in <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/Nokia/blog/151274/">our review of the Lumia 920 and 820</a> . <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/6HSbhyaH0vw&amp;xid=25657,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhicolcy9z5Husrs3X2d755z_dbc_w" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Separately, it is worthwhile to dwell on the program component, in particular, on a number of programs, under the general name Lenses.  By the way, as many as five lenses were used in the optical stabilization module, but this is not about them now.  Lenses were introduced during our September press conference and will be available on all Windows Phone 8 phones. <br><br>  Some of the "lenses" were developed by Microsoft - Bing Vision, CNN iReport, Panorama, Photosynth, Blink, FXSuite and PhotoStrip.  Some add to the camera elements of augmented reality, others - advanced filters and advanced features, such as automatic gluing panoramas.  Also, third-party developers can create their own "lenses" that will be available to users in the Marketplace and will be displayed in the "Lenses" menu of the Camera application. <br><br>  At Nokia, in turn, we continue the good tradition begun on Camera Extras on Windows Phone 7 based Lumia phones, and bring to your attention a few of our own lenses that are already built into our new phones.  They are the product of the joint work of a dedicated research team, which included our engineers from Tampere, photographers from Espoo, and developers from the recently acquired company Scalado from the Swedish Lund.  Mention of the latest and its developments met on Habr√©, and we are proud that our new phones have embodied the most impressive of them. <br><br>  An interesting feature of the "lenses" is their close integration with the system application "Camera".  Photographs taken with the help of ‚Äúlenses‚Äù have a mark in the gallery indicating which frame the lens was made with.  This allows you to re-open the image in the same lens application and edit it again, changing the settings. <br><br><h4>  "Smart shooting" </h4><br>  We all sometimes come across this situation: we are going to have a rest, we see an interesting and picturesque place and we want to take a group picture with our friends.  And here we ask someone to take a picture of us all together, the person presses a button and we get a great photo in which one of the friends blinked, and the second decided that the picture was taken, and turned away.  Photo spoiled as the mood. <br><br><img src="http://cdn.conversations.nokia.com.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Select-Face-EyesClosed.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Using the ‚Äúlens‚Äù ‚ÄúSmart Shoot‚Äù (Smart Shoot) the camera takes several shots at the time of the shot and allows you to select the most successful one.  In addition, several pictures can be combined by selecting a snapshot of a blinking friend with his eyes open from one of them, and turned away while still looking at the camera from another frame in the series. <br><br><img src="http://cdn.conversations.nokia.com.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Select-Face-FInal-.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The second, but not the least important, function of the Smart Shoot lens is the removal of moving objects from the captured image.  Its prototype - Remove - was demonstrated in February as part of the World Mobile Congress in Barcelona.  This function works on the same principle as the previous one - the application takes several pictures, then it detects moving objects in the frame using recognition technology and suggests choosing which object you would like to remove from the picture by outlining it. <br><br><img src="http://cdn.conversations.nokia.com.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Remove_objects_screenshot1.png" alt="image"><br><br>  You just need to click on the selected contour so that the program removes the character from the image that was in the frame, in fact, also collecting the final frame from several and substituting for the selected object empty space from another frame of the series. <br><br><img src="http://cdn.conversations.nokia.com.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Remove_objects_screenshot2.png" alt="image"><br><br>  As you can see, to implement all this magic, the software divides the frame into two parts - ‚Äústable‚Äù and ‚Äúunstable‚Äù.  And here our optical stabilization is needed more than ever, since any phone jitter greatly complicates the work of the algorithm analyzing the frame. <br><br><img src="http://cdn.conversations.nokia.com.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Remove_objects_best_result.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  ‚ÄúLived Photos‚Äù </h4><br>  Another ‚Äúlens‚Äù developed by us is called ‚ÄúAnimated Photos‚Äù (Cinemagraph).  Many of you have already heard about <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/129838/">sinegraphs and sinegraphs</a> - stunning images that combine photos and videos.  If a regular photo captures a static moment, then a blue-graphic is a moment in motion.  A breath of wind chasing the foliage down the street, a car passing by, a falling strand of hair, water dripping from a tap ‚Äî there are thousands of examples.  Jamie Beck, one of the founders of the movement and co-author of the term ‚Äúbluegraph‚Äù, described this genre as follows: ‚ÄúThey have a cinematic quality ... like a live photo.  It is always a photograph first. ‚Äù <br><br>  More recently, creating such beautiful images required a watch in front of the monitor and a good knowledge of Adobe Photoshop and After Effects.  Today, if you have Lumia on Windows Phone 8, a few seconds are enough. <br><br>  Suppose you are traveling, taking pictures for memory of visited cities and countries and at some point you come across a picture that would be especially good in motion.  For example, a waving flag on the flagpole of an old castle or a lizard, climbing onto a stone to bask in the sun, etc.  Great, launch the Cinemagraph ‚Äúlens‚Äù.  As soon as you press the trigger, it will generate a 5-second file at 15 frames per second.  Then, by analogy with Smart Shoot, it will highlight moving objects, and you can choose which ones you want to keep static and which you want to move.  The output is a GIF file of 1-4 megabytes. <br><br>  Here are some examples of photos taken with Cinemagraph - on the Lumia 920 and Lumia 820. <br><br><img src="http://cdn.conversations.nokia.com.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Lumia-920-cinemagraph-2.gif" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://cdn.conversations.nokia.com.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Lumia-820-cinemagraph.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  Just as with the rest of the ‚Äúlenses,‚Äù you can always go back to editing the captured image, change the animation settings, select not one, but two moving elements, after which the file can be uploaded to SkyDrive and share it with friends. <br><br>  This combination of software and hardware solutions will allow you to get even better pictures with the help of your new Lumia, which will delight you and your loved ones for a very long time. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/158239/">https://habr.com/ru/post/158239/</a></p>
