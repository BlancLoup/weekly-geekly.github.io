      The company "Yandex" announced that at the <a href="https://habr.com/ru/news/t/458066/">end of 2018 it was subjected to attacks by intruders</a> .  This attack consisted of attempts by cybercriminals to infiltrate a rare type of malware into the company's infrastructure.  Subject to the successful introduction of it into the network, the malware operator can monitor user accounts for the company's services. <br><br>  Cybercriminals hunted for technical information that provides user authorization.  If the attack was successful, the hackers could easily get a large amount of personal data of the company's users. <br><br><h3>  Google will distribute the Internet with balloons in Kenya </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/64a/356/1a5/64a3561a570b6ccede32405e42150ebe.jpg"><br><br>  Over the next few weeks, Google, together with one of Kenya‚Äôs largest Internet service providers, is <a href="https://habr.com/ru/news/t/458476/">planning to launch the Internet by air</a> .  We are talking about the project Project Loon, which is gradually being implemented by the corporation. <br><br>  For the first time the Internet with balloons decided to distribute in 2011.  Then the company connected to this project artificial intelligence, which monitors the placement and direction of movement of balloons.  Now the project will be tested for the first time on a commercial basis, since previously all tests were conducted free of charge for the end user. <br><br>  If the Google project shows itself well in Kenya, then other companies mentioned above will also test it.  ‚ÄúIf the results are positive, we will be interested in the project,‚Äù said a representative of Orange Middle East and Africa. <br><br><h3>  The Ministry of Transport will regulate the work of online aggregators of joint trips on cars </h3><br>  The Russian Ministry of Transport <a href="https://habr.com/ru/news/t/458322/">plans to regulate online aggregators</a> .  The largest service of its kind is BlaBlaCar.  The project imposes a number of restrictions on the capabilities of those users who offer transportation services. <br><br>  In particular, the project prohibits the use of cash to pay for driver services, plus a limit is imposed on the number of flights per day (no more than two) and the number of fellow travelers - there should not be more than five. <br><br>  As for the draft law, this is a document representing a new federal law; it also supplements the existing norms.  It was sent on June 28 to the members of the working group of the Ministry of Transport, which regulates legal relations on such trips. <br><br><h3>  NASA sends a rover to Titan, though not today or tomorrow </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dfb/8bc/3e4/dfb8bc3e4792f26bf5c9aec1ec70ca2d.png"><br><br>  The NASA agency announced its intention to <a href="https://habr.com/ru/news/t/458234/">send a flying Dragonfly rover to the Titan</a> .  This device, according to the plan, will go to the planetoid in 2026.  It should sink into the atmosphere of the object in 2034.  The device is an oktokopter - this is a drone with four double screws.  This kind of copter has never landed outside the Earth. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe device will fly to dozens of places on Titan in search of chemical elements and processes that are common both on Titan and on Earth.  Titan is an analogue of the Earth at the earliest stage of its development and can give a hint about how life could appear on our planet, ‚ÄùNASA said in a press release. <br><br><h3>  US cancels sanctions against Huawei </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/179/bba/01e/179bba01ea8412c9ab77770a094e198a.jpg"><br><br>  US President Donald Trump said that almost all sanctions against the Chinese company Huawei are canceled.  Negotiations on this issue were held at the G-20 summit in Japan. <br><br>  As far as one can understand, the reason for the lifting of sanctions against Huawei, obviously, was the successful negotiations between the representatives of the countries regarding the planned US increase in duties on imported goods from China.  Earlier, Donald Trump expressed dissatisfaction with the trade imbalance between the two countries.  As a result of the negotiations held, he stated: ‚ÄúNow we don‚Äôt plan to increase tariffs for China in the near future.  We look forward to working with China.  Looks like they are open for communication and ready to start spending money. " <br><br><h3>  FAS will fight illegal online casino advertising </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e9b/d5e/288/e9bd5e28894b3ab589bc05711280e71b.jpg"><br><br>  The Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) of Russia is going to get the right to block sites with <a href="https://habr.com/ru/news/t/458082/">illegal advertising of online casinos with the help of Roskomnadzor</a> . <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe problem with online casinos is really big.  Casino advertising is prohibited on the Internet.  And, in principle, in search engines and on news sites, it does not appear.  Such advertising is more typical for sites with pirated content, but these sites are not always located in our domain zones, so it is not always possible to block access to such a site.  We know this problem and are trying to solve it, ‚ÄùTatiana Nikitina, head of the department for monitoring advertising and unfair competition of the FAS, told the TASS news agency. <br><br><h3>  Corel and Parallels sold for $ 1 billion </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/153/05c/c29/15305cc29d77500844989c76ff301b80.png"><br><br>  The companies mentioned in the title were <a href="https://habr.com/ru/news/t/458678/">bought by the US investment group KKR</a> .  The fact that KKR plans to acquire Corel became known as early as May 2019 - true, then there was no clear signal from the buyer, so the information went only in the form of rumors.  Now the total amount of the transaction is not disclosed, but sources close to both the seller and the buyer state that the volume of the transaction is at least $ 1 billion. <br><br>  In the KRR said they plan to continue the policy of Corel - to buy promising companies and use their assets.  At the moment, it is not known which Corel products will continue to develop, and which ones will remain in their previous form or will be closed. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/458972/">https://habr.com/ru/post/458972/</a></p>
