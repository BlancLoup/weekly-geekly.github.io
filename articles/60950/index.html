Tower 2: Wordencliffe</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Well. <br><br>  It took much longer than expected. <br><br>  The Coworking Club ‚ÄúTower‚Äù has finally moved to a new office located in Yekaterinburg at the address of Kraulya Street, 51. Three months after we began to dig the earth in search of a replacement for the old landmark tower in which we worked our first year, located on the floor and balcony.

      We have been working for a year.  We made many mistakes, tried a lot of good finds, survived the crisis ... And now we are just trying to start anew, implementing the best of what we understood during this time. <br><br>  We present you our new office,% username%: <br><br>  <strong>Tower 2: Wordencliffe</strong> <br><br> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/fotonstep/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b28/43e/d05/b2843ed0539bea34ef145ba91ae704ca.jpg" alt="Vordencliffe Tower"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/52b/17f/ea7/52b17fea7813c6c8b33dabddfce9eb05.jpg" alt="Tower Map"></a> <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Most great developers and cool entrepreneurs know how a good office should look.  They also know that they do not and will not have it.  Office space seems to be a thing that no one can understand and cannot do anything about. <br><br>  There is a wealth of evidence that proper organization of the workspace significantly increases productivity.  But even if the company rents an office for a period of ten years - the last person to be asked about the arrangement of office space becomes its employee.  Exactly on Monday after the move, he finds out what his stable will look like (that is, I wanted to say - an office with partitions) ... <br><br>  A businessman, if he is a good businessman, would rather spend money on a consignment of goods than on arranging a classroom.  Although it would be desirable.  And, of course, they will not ask employees - and so it is clear that they want comfort in their work no less than him. <br><br>  Damn it, we can try to do something about it in our own coworking office!  In the end, this is our work: in coworking, we spend a significant part of our lives, far from our relatives and friends.  Such a place just has to be cool. <br><br>  <strong>What will it be?</strong> <br><br>  Having in the presence of awesome, delightful workplaces, halls with soft floors and huge windows, an unusual structure and convenient location - it is much easier to attract high-class professionals and entrepreneurs to the co-working club.  It is a pity that you have not seen their fallen jaws yet when they arrive at the Tower.  This is a drama. <br><br>  But we want more.  And, having a decent area (140 sq. Meters and, I think, a roof) and an enthusiastic team, we set a goal to create for ourselves a ‚Äúperfect working space‚Äù. <br><br>  What will we have? <br><br><ul><li>  <em>Comfortable, functional places:</em> coworkers should be able to connect all their devices, use office equipment and communicate with other coworkers, without rising from the chair.  Must be at least: a network filter with 5-7 outlets at each table (at the table level, of course), a scooter chair, a local grid, the Internet and Skypephone. </li><li>  <em>The SnakeTray system is under the ceiling:</em> it makes it possible to easily lay any cables (telephone, network, cable TV, alarm) so that they do not come across to the eyes, but you do not even have to open the walls for this. </li><li>  <em>Round-the-clock mode:</em> 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year - we do not change ourselves, believing that it works best when everything is on board and not when it is convenient for the girl at the reception of the office center.  The office should generally allow coworkers to work at any time, even if it would require sacrificing the interests of non-coworkers. </li><li>  <em>There are a lot of windows with a great view:</em> while working with the monitor during the whole working day, you should periodically rest your eyes, looking at distant objects. <br> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/fotonstep/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1af/07e/aa1/1af07eaa11e49bd9ee30124a2498c44c.jpg" alt="View from the Tower in the afternoon"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/152/20d/bb3/15220dbb314fecb70a810117bd0e1e3a.jpg" alt="Same view almost at night"></a> <br></li><li>  <em>Many places to relax:</em> with a 16-hour working day, it is generally necessary to periodically let yourself relax.  We will equip each hall of our new office with a social / leisure area with a sofa, coffee table and a small library.  We also plan to place a pool somewhere, if we find a place for it.  It may be a roof, as we are persistently seeking permission to use it under our responsibility (we are on the top floor). </li><li>  <em>Cozy and friendly atmosphere: the</em> co-workers should want to meet with clients and friends in the office, right on the sofas, and not in the cafe opposite.  As Philip Greenspan noted subtly, <em>‚ÄúThe success of your business depends on how many employees practically live in your office.</em>  <em>In order to do this, it is necessary that your office be better than their home</em> . <em>‚Äù</em> </li><li>  <em>Division into areas:</em> spontaneous associations by project and professional skills should be encouraged in the office so that each co-worker has the opportunity to join the group that he or she is most interested in. </li><li>  <em>Internet at any point in space: you</em> definitely need Wifi so that you can freely connect your laptop, work computer, iphone and that old computer that you hold as a server.  I laugh at the stupid managers who still think that wiring a network is normal.  For a travel agency - perhaps, but not for a coworking club filled with high-class professionals. </li><li>  <em>Teamwork: the</em> ability to work in pairs, triples and other combinations at any time when it is needed.  We took one room under the kitchen, which will have a sofa, a pile of chairs, a large table for 8 people with rounded edges and a magnetic board.  All normal people know that the kitchen is the best place to solve problems, because it allows you to simultaneously think, talk and chew.  And in our case - and you can think and chew collectively. </li><li>  <em>Protection from</em> prying <em>eyes:</em> we allow each coworker to place his workplace as he pleases.  Thanks to such a wonderful routine, there is no damage to privacy: the co-worker himself determines the level of openness for himself.  And although in each room 2 of 4 walls are deaf, we do not leave attempts to obtain permission to pierce internal windows in these walls (this will be the most ideal solution). </li></ul><br><br>  <strong>And for the money of what?</strong> <br><br>  The monthly fee for a place in the ‚ÄúWardencliffe‚Äù is now 3000 from the muzzle, and when it is fully occupied - about 2500 per co-worker.  Interestingly, we do the repair of the premises ourselves, and the lessor pays for the budget almost completely.  Do you know what that means?  That's right: what we want, we do. <br><br>  I suspect that the amount of 2500 per person for Yekaterinburg is almost a unique price, and I am sure that we will be able to attract 99.9% of the people we need without any interference from real estate agencies and inadequate employers. <br><br>  Like this. <br><br>  If there is a desire - welcome.  <a href="http://effman.ru/coworking/">Coworking Club ‚ÄúWordencliffe‚Äù is</a> eager for new members - and of course, Polygon incubator and the <a href="http://inklab.ru/">INK business laboratory</a> are open to everyone. <br><br>  Good luck in life and deeds! <br>  Sincerely, Alexey Glazkov. <br><br>  PS: The article was written under the inspiration of Joel‚Äôs <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/BionicOffice.html">Bionic Office</a> .
