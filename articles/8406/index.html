      1. Why am I being frank? <br>  I am already an elderly person who has achieved everything in life that can only be dreamed of.  I cannot live with my money until the end of my days, and given the modesty of my needs, I cannot live for many lives. <br>  I am no longer interested in making money.  Being a Jew, I, with the exception of the last years, lived and worked in Russia, I learned the country and its people well, I studied the strength and weaknesses of the Russians.  Having started as a merciless exploiter and a Jew, I gradually became sympathetic to the great and super-tolerant Russian people, and now I sincerely wish him well. <br>  I changed religion, was baptized in Orthodoxy, in many respects I broke up with the Jewish community and its joint opinion, although I did not stop being a Jew to the end. <br>  My money, torn first from Russia, is now working for the good of Russia, and my life experience could also serve as a Russian.  I hope that by publishing with this free reprint of this (firstly intra-corporate confidential) brochure, I will benefit the people who are desperate and stuck in insoluble problems. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  1. Why am I being frank? <br>  I am already an elderly person who has achieved everything in life that can only be dreamed of.  I cannot live with my money until the end of my days, and given the modesty of my needs, I cannot live for many lives. <br>  I am no longer interested in making money.  Being a Jew, I, with the exception of the last years, lived and worked in Russia, I learned the country and its people well, I studied the strength and weaknesses of the Russians.  Having started as a merciless exploiter and a Jew, I gradually became sympathetic to the great and super-tolerant Russian people, and now I sincerely wish him well. <br>  I changed religion, was baptized in Orthodoxy, in many respects I broke up with the Jewish community and its joint opinion, although I did not stop being a Jew to the end. <br>  My money, torn first from Russia, is now working for the good of Russia, and my life experience could also serve as a Russian.  I hope that by publishing with this free reprint of this (firstly intra-corporate confidential) brochure, I will benefit the people who are desperate and stuck in insoluble problems. <br>  In fact, there is not everyone in the world according to the Sun, but money in the world can be enough for everyone.  In order for them to be needed, first of all, the desire and ability to accept them, and good luck, good luck, once again good luck. <br>  Ask any Russian: what is luck?  He will answer - luck, not depending on us.  Jews brought up differently.  From a young age we are taught that luck is a product of purposeful action, that seemingly random events are actually prepared by people, their faith and will. <br>  The world is not the element of chaos, and luck is not so blind as many imagine it.  People on earth receive different amounts <br>  money, because they perceive reality differently, they feel the world differently. <br>  In order to make you richer, changes are needed not from the outside, <br>  and inside you.  This, if you will, is the magic of success. <br>  Our primitive ancestor, before going hunting, painted a deer in the sand and hit an imaginary beast with a spear.  Why did he do it?  Just because of his darkness - or he knew from the experience of millennia that a plan, an ideological development of a future event, precedes every material action. <br>  This magic was not primitive, it really helped the hunter to get this deer.  Such is the power of faith ‚Äî the power to materialize our desires and ideas.  Or vice versa - to materialize our fears and phobias. <br>  When in the beginning of the 90s I, a modest scientist, started a business, I very strictly followed one condition of Western social psychology: ‚ÄúTo drive even the most intelligent employee into the neck if he decomposes the team with pessimism and disbelief in the success‚Äù.  Then I just followed the Western fashion, and did not understand why I was doing this? <br>  Now I know exactly what the point is.  If in that ancient tribe there were a very sensible hunter who would have doubted the sand figure, then the tribe would not have gotten a real deer and would have died of starvation.  One cannot joke with faith: the placebo (that is, the external material attributes of the faith) can be anything, even on sand, even on silk banners, even on a tree of icons - but faith itself moves things, and moves just as much as it is strong. <br>  If you do not believe in the success of an enterprise, it is better not to start it at all!  - Everywhere advise novice entrepreneurs.  You probably think this is a metaphor?  That success of a business only indirectly depends on faith in it? <br>  No, it is the most direct way. <br>  - How to earn big money <br><br>  2. Russian folk sayings and signs are milestones of popular observation. <br>  It was not for nothing that I decided to confirm my thought with the help of everyone from my childhood familiar folk observations about happiness and unhappiness, about luck and failure.  For centuries, people have observed the dynamics of the enrichment process, and, not always understanding the underlying causes, still quite accurately characterized the visible side. <br>  ‚ÄúOnly a treasure is given to fools,‚Äù wrote the poet Yershov in the text.  This amazing observation seems at first glance, completely illogical, ridiculous, but it is true.  Why treasure and taking wider - wealth - are given to "fools"?  There is their definition of the Gospel - ‚Äúthe poor in spirit‚Äù - less rude, but the essence is the same. <br>  A fool has one curious property - when starting a business, he does not think about all the upcoming difficulties, obstacles and obstacles that the ‚Äúsmart‚Äù will set in advance on his mental path.  By virtue of this, the folk "fool" complex is simple.  But, it would seem, this is his personal affair: if you don‚Äôt see the wall, it doesn‚Äôt mean that you don‚Äôt crack your forehead! <br>  However - what a miracle!  - ‚ÄúFool‚Äù, not seeing the wall, passes through it, without even noticing, and not only in the fairy tale - very often in life.  Success comes to him by itself - apparently, and the wall, clearly visible "smart" in fact was imaginary, self-created in the mind, illusory. <br>  This property - the loss of luck, especially commercial, spiritually stupid natures - is not an accident and not ‚Äújudgment of the heavens‚Äù.  The world depends on our ideas about it, and the more spiritually refined nature sees for itself in the world of obstacles, the more they (by its own order!) Arise.  For example, if you put a problem before a refined intellectual: ‚Äústart trading‚Äù, he will come up with thousands of reasons for failure beforehand: collusion in the market, the power of wholesale suppliers, racketeering, unstable greedy power, and many other factors.  But we often see how the neighbor of this intellectual, who studied at a school for underdeveloped children (even it happens!), Suddenly opens up a trade and leads it successfully, because, because of its stupidity and underdevelopment of the imagination, it does not think about the upcoming difficulties. <br>  We gloatingly look at the "fool": they say, does not see a trap, now it will please him!  He passes - and the trap is not in place.  We follow - and fall into the "long-awaited" trap.  What is the matter?  We just live in different worlds.  But more about that later. <br>  "The trouble does not go alone" - says our proverb.  Why so?  By simple probability, misfortune and joy, good luck and bad luck should seem to be distributed approximately equally, at least chaotically.  But the people have long noticed that fate strikes heaps.  For some reason, one misfortune attracts, magnetizes another, the more misfortunes the more of them are added, as if they are peculiar to them.  What a parable?  After all, luck and failure are the lot, not subject to us, our mind and our will.  How can we calculate success or failure in advance?  How can we increase or decrease it?  Is cheating in casino good luck?  About this below, but for now let's remember it well: a person subjected to a blow by failure somehow loses ‚Äúimmunity‚Äù, and one failure opens the way for another, outwardly with her, seemingly unconnected. <br>  "The lousy goat spoils the whole Ovchara."  The direct essence of the saying is clear - a sick animal strikes a healthy one.  But this is not about animals and not about the epidemic.  The symbolic plan of saying another, one member of a collective, obsessed with some kind of spiritual leprosy, can ruin the whole collective, corrupt and corrupt.  And why, for example, not the other way around?  It would seem that the team has much more opportunities to remake the ‚Äúgoat‚Äù in itself.  What is the "goat" interest to fight with everyone around you?  Yes, often he does not set a goal to remake someone - all by itself turns out.  The social reality in the team changes - from successful it becomes a bunch of losers, from exemplary - a crowd of crooks or whiners.  Why?  As far as the factor of ‚Äúfaith‚Äù and ‚Äúwill‚Äù is evident here, we are on the verge of solving the great mystery of the relationship between material reality and man‚Äôs faith and will ... <br>  ‚ÄúBorn in a shirt‚Äù is about a lucky person: As the saying goes, ‚Äútrouble does not go alone,‚Äù and here it is emphasized: as luck is received, the likelihood of a new receipt is increased.  The more victories - the greater the chance of a new victory.  The more obvious the success - the greater the chance of its repetition.  Why?  What a strange relationship?  It seems like a person must be convinced that he is successful - and after that he magically becomes successful ?! <br>  ‚ÄúMoney goes to money‚Äù is another confirmation of what has been said.  Why are the rich getting richer and the poor poorer?  Does the ‚Äúconspiracy‚Äù factor play a role?  If so, then who prevents the poor from making the same "conspiracy"?  Questions, questions - and there is no answer yet ... "Never speak for people" no "until they themselves told him to you" is a wise and very practical saying.  Often, a person so vividly imagines the alleged refusal of his request, so clearly and in the roles he plays in the imagination the scene of his failure, and there is no need to go and find out anything.  He asked and answered himself, the request died in himself - what more? <br>  But quite often we encountered situations where such a person still overcame himself and decided to go and find out the real result. <br>  He is not surprised at all when the result exactly corresponds to his developed imagination.  It would seem that he just correctly calculated the world - but someone else suddenly achieves completely different results with the same starting indicator as our skeptic.  Why? <br><br>  3. Metaphysics of the Universe <br>  When an Orthodox Russian reads in the Gospel a clear "instruction for using the Universe" - "ask - and it will be given to you", "If you have faith with mustard seed - and you can move mountains, order a tree with roots, rush into the ocean", then by virtue of peculiarities of upbringing understands this as an allegory divorced from life. <br>  A Jew knows better than a Russian that this text needs to be understood literally, that we have an effective system for arranging life.  Jesus Christ perfectly knew the answer to your, reader, question - how to earn big money?  Among the Hindus, we find the idea of ‚Äã‚Äã"maya" - the universal illusion surrounding the human being, a certain kingdom of mirages concealing the truth of the Brahman.  Is material nature an illusion?  Is the stable, familiar world around us a simple mirage?  And the laws of things that we used to obey - invented by ourselves? <br>  For myself, I have long ago decided this question positively.  A scientist with a degree and an entrepreneur with millions, I know well: if tomorrow humanity believes that the earth - I apologize for the expression, the parallelepiped, then angular images of our planet will be brought from space. <br>  Already from school we know that there is no matter, that a seemingly solid object consists of particles that are spaced apart from each other in cosmic proportions.  And inside the particles there is also an emptiness (the electron of the ‚Äúindivisible‚Äù atom is separated from the nucleus just as the pinhead on the last bench of the Luzhniki Stadium from the tennis ball in the middle of this stadium). <br>  But the nucleus of the atom is just as empty - there are elements of it.  While science got to the ‚Äúquark‚Äù - the time will come, it will prove their emptiness.  So there is no matter.  But maybe energy exists? <br>  The calculations of modern physicists show that the sum of all positively and negatively directed energies in the Universe should be equal to zero.  Yes, we ourselves know that action is equal to counteraction - isn‚Äôt it a reason to think about the reality of energy? <br>  If there is neither matter nor energy, then maybe there is empty space?  Modern science turns space into a mathematical point without volume, in conditions of infinity at any point in the universe, mathematically equal segments can be set aside in all directions.  But this is a ball formula!  And, it turns out, we are all the time in the center of the same ball, no matter how much we move ... <br>  Infinity is not something very huge, as it seems to everyday consciousness.  Huge still has the material parameters, and their infinity is deprived.  Mathematically, it is much closer and more typological to zero than to the immense, embarrassing imagination. <br>  The gigantism of the universe and the abandonment in it of a grain of sand - man <br>  - schizophrenic illusion of the XX century.  It reflects not the true state of things, but only the painful decadence of the spirit of its creators. <br>  But if you take the standpoint of the Hindus with their maya, the illusiveness of the material, then what really is?  It seems to me (and this confirms my commercial experience) that in fact there is a dynamic system of interconnection between the individual and the Universe, which is very flexible and calculated under the mental maturity of the individual. <br>  I imagine the universe as a device for illustrating our ideas about it.  We briefly enter into ‚Äúmaya‚Äù and exist here in the world that we consider necessary to create for ourselves.  It would seem - a fairy tale, the kingdom of dreams! <br>  But the danger lies in the fact that our consciousness is able to simulate both evil and hell on earth.  It‚Äôs in vain to blame the Universe for this ‚Äî it only fulfilled our application. You have to blame yourself ‚Äî that‚Äôs why the great teachers of humanity insisted on the human transformation, realizing that it‚Äôs useless to build a new world with old views on the universe. <br>  We live in a world of faith and will - and nothing more.  Everything else has a placebo character.  What is a placebo?  Doctors so call a pacifier, which is given to the patient under the guise of medicine.  Believing in the fact that this medicine, many suggested patients get better, So sweat - actions, bank notes, diplomas and everything else - our placebo, our holds for our own faith.  Take a closer look at them - what would these colored papers become without a collective faith in them, without a collective deification of them?  Only your ardent faith in their value makes them truly valuable.  Plus - makes them difficult to reach for you.  If you are internally inclined to the idea that it is difficult to get money, then it is difficult for you to get it.  The facts that confirm your ‚Äúrightness‚Äù, the obedient Universe, will gladly provide you with - she works on your requests.  The more of these facts, the more convincing your poverty will be for you, the more you will link it.  The moment will come when the amount of your faith in your own failure will become equal to the mustard seed - then woe to you, you are already incurable, you have created a stable world around you, which is almost impossible to shake. <br>  Faith is a dangerous, two-way factor.  She can help us grow - and she can bend us to nothingness.  It enriches us - and it plunges into the quagmire of hopeless poverty. <br>  Our world we receive first of all from our parents - this is what Hindus call ‚Äúkarma‚Äù.  Since the spirit that has entered the dense layers of maya does not yet have its own ideas about life, the world for it is built up by its mentors.  What the world was for parents - holiday or hard labor - so it will be for the child.  Then, mother, it is very difficult for us to change our ‚Äúkarma‚Äù.  We were convinced - and proved by facts, examples - that it is very difficult to get a thousand.  And we don't understand - how can it be easy for someone to get a million?  After all, it‚Äôs still obvious ... <br>  In critical times it becomes especially clear how much our ideas about life mean.  In post-reform Russia of the 1990s, one part of the population considered capitalism a paradise - and now lives in paradise, at least, a material paradise.  The other part believed that capitalism was hell, they were brought up like this, and they ended up in hell as soon as the placebo keyword capitalism sounded. <br>  In fact, any "isms" are empty; our ideas about the Universe fill them with content.  The people of Marx and the People of Smith are equally right - they just live in different worlds, in different universes. <br>  The universe consists of different layers and layers <br>  views: <br>  1) Our personal presentation. <br>  2) Collective and group views. <br>  3) Historically formed representations of a number of generations. <br>  4) Absolute laws of nature that have never been changed in the memory of mankind. <br>  Accordingly, there are also modes - ‚Äúsentences‚Äù in reality around us.  We ourselves do not know for sure - from where ‚Äî but firmly convinced that this is ‚Äúimpossible‚Äù, the other is ‚Äúunlikely,‚Äù the third is ‚Äúvery likely‚Äù, and the fourth is ‚Äúinevitable." <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, the will of a person, if it is trained, as athletes train muscles, is able to withstand even the fourth group of ideas - ‚Äúabsolute laws‚Äù with a modus - a pretext ‚Äúimpossible‚Äù. During my business trips to Southeast Asia and Hindustan, I myself met and talked with yogis, magicians, monks who overcame gravity, levitated, teleported objects. This is the height of the will, its monstrous power, comparable to that reflected in the words of Christ about the "mustard seed of faith." Few can overcome Maya at its very foundation, raise its mass at the very foundation. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We know that these were the disciples of Christ.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Moreover, the case is described very vividly - when a disciple, contrary to the law of nature, went to Christ by water, but then he doubted the possibility of such a miracle - and immediately began to fall, to sink. There are quite historical testimonies about the Russian saint Seraphim of Sarov, who ‚Äúhovered above the ground,‚Äù that is, he levitated in defiance of gravity. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I admit honestly, I did not achieve such heights of ‚Äúvolpinism‚Äù (I produce this sport from two words - ‚Äúwill‚Äù and ‚Äúmountaineering‚Äù), and it is unlikely that I will.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But I know that if a world record of volpinism is possible, then its regional championships and courtyards are possible. If you set the task of getting rich, then you do not need to grudge over the overcoming of the laws of nature, it is much easier for you, because the money falls into the category of "probable." Few of you, the reader, have seen, like me, levitating magicians. But almost all of you have seen rich people not far from you - maybe even in the apartment next to you. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The fact is that, as we have already shown by the example of Russian proverbs, luck is by no means blind. It is given to everyone according to your ‚Äúfaith,‚Äù and in accordance with the will and direction of the will of each one who asks.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> So Avtopakum, the archpriest, begged for himself from the Universe ‚Äúthe times of Nero and Diocletian‚Äù with the kindest Alexey Mikhailovich, who many times tried unsuccessfully to pardon his ‚Äúsacrifice‚Äù. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The will to master money in our Jewish families is brought up from early childhood. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is in the method of "volpinism" the secret of Jewish fabulous wealth. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Then, of course, a ‚Äúconspiracy‚Äù and ‚Äúsuper-solidarity of the Jews‚Äù will be added here, but the basis was the Jewish faith in God's chosen people. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"God will give us all the riches of the world!" - Jews asserted from century to century. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The riches gave them, of course, not God (the creative, thinking, righteous superpersonality of the Universe), but the Universe (Maya, the illusion of the material). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">God, I think, grieved, looking at the affairs of my fellow tribesmen. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But the universe gives everyone by faith, not by righteousness. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is much clearer to say than in the Gospel: "It will be according to your faith."</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Without Messianism of Jewry, our plot would have been nothing. He is the dummy, the ‚Äúplacebo,‚Äù holding on to which the Jews think they have caught the Lord by the Beard. It is impossible to explain Jewish success only by material factors. Could not the other peoples be opposed to the conspiracy of the miserable and persecuted rootless vagrants by their other, more powerful conspiracy? Did not the powerful sovereigns have power over the Jews by their subjects?</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But I was raised in an environment that believes in the money of the world, as if it were my own money, and applied (already after) to this faith a lot of plausible placebo. The Jew is a born volpinist (like the Negro is a born boxer, an athlete), but this does not mean that other nations are not able to master volpinism. It‚Äôs just harder for them, because their mentality (another placebo for the parent universe) involves a lot of enrichment ideas. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, there are also rich among Russians, even though they are smaller than Jews. Volpinism, like any sport, depends on the initial data, intensity of training and abilities of trainers. The intensity of </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">training can smooth out the defects of the original data.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The Russians, like the people, have very large abilities for volpinism, but a different group of ‚Äúcreedomuchts‚Äù is developed, so to speak. The Russians are distinguished by a very strong messianic spirit, which allowed them, figuratively speaking, to launch satellites in their sandals, drain the seas and turn the rivers. It was a miracle, if we consider volpinism to be a miracle, a miracle that people refused to believe in in the rationalistic west. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">4. Methods of revenue growth </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So, get ready for practical training in the style of volpinism. First you need to measure your abilities in the "natural" state - how much you earn, how much </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"calculated" Our individual Universe.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">First of all, you need to analyze your social circle, cut off skeptics and whiners, pessimists - they are like weights on the legs of a volpinist. On the contrary, try to find like-minded people - optimists who believe in success as you do. It is always easier to make your way to the top of the group - the factor of ‚Äúmutual pulling‚Äù affects. Outside, this is taken for "criminal gang", "gang", "conspirators" - it all sometimes overlaps, but only as a placebo. There are many groupings, but not all of them are successful, the majority are stagnating. Hence, the main question is not in group-grouping, which by itself does not guarantee success, but in some special properties within the group. We know - this is group volpinism.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A very important and difficult stage is the abandonment of the ‚Äúold world,‚Äù the reality created spontaneously, by the labor of your parents and your friends, in the chaos of your childhood impressions. What now seems to you as ‚Äúobjective reality‚Äù is actually a very random set of fantasies about the world from various sources. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Think about what should be the "new world"? Maybe everything suits you in the "old", then you can only congratulate. Maybe you lack something else and not money? </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We are now talking only about money. If you are firmly convinced that you lack a certain amount, then get ready for an assault on the frontier of new reality.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you are a poor teacher - and you make a million dollars right away, then I give my head to the cut-off, you will fail. It is as if an untrained athlete set the bar for the World Cup. It is necessary to understand that although there is nothing impossible for the Universe (it happens, and the poor will win a million in the lottery, and, as you understand, for good reason!), But there is much that is impossible for you.</font></font><br>  Be realistic.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Income growth is planned for the next year, so that there is room for maneuver, and do not start with more than 20%. Once I set the bar for ‚Äúdouble incomes‚Äù - and failed miserably </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- not because I passed the technique, but because I myself could not believe such a turn. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There is only one risk: set the bar high, fall through, and exacerbate doubts. After each failure will return to the trajectory of luck becomes more difficult, although the hopeless positions, of course, does not happen. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The main danger. It would seem, what is easier? I made a wish for myself, seriously wanted something - and here it is, ready-made, from the oven of the Universe ... </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In fact, the Universe does not satisfy all desires. Psychotechnics of different nations of the world teach one thing: overcoming the emotional side of desire, i.e. "Lust."</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Compare your feelings in two cases. When you want to eat, you go to the kitchen and open the refrigerator. In your inner world, the desire to eat is present, but there is no lust, you are calm, there are no emotions. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You do not ask the question how and from where kefir and sausage got into your refrigerator. You know that they have come a rather difficult way, but you always have them in abundance and you do not worry about them. They are near, just reach out and take ... </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Your feelings cannot be divided by the peoples of Asia and Africa, where the masses are dying of hunger. In their case, frightened lust and fear that there may be no food are added to the desire for food. The stronger this fear, this doubt (it‚Äôs not for nothing that terrible words are said - ‚Äúworm of doubt‚Äù), the less likely it is to get what you want.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As Pushkin wrote: ‚ÄúThe less we love a woman, the more we like her.‚Äù The same can be said about money, because the principle is the same. I do not know a single businessman who would LOVE money. Businessmen use money cynically and prudently, and the love of money would kill them. You know that for profit, you first need to invest a lot, that is, to part with money, and the more ruthless this separation, the better the result. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">They love money, oddly enough, it is the poor. They dry over them, sort them out, lick them in their hands, value them - and they don‚Äôt get reciprocate themselves: money always goes to them a little. Hence the motto of the business that you have heard many times: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs impossible to save a truly large amount, you can only earn it.‚Äù</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What is the salt? The universe, along with your application by lust, receives an additional application for the inaccessibility of the requested. If you desire (and not just simply want to be everyday), then a terrible mark has been punched on your application: ‚Äúit wishes to receive it with great difficulties‚Äù. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Here again, no one to blame. You ordered a cake with problems, and you get it. Of course, it is overgrown with a mass of placebo, economic conditions, industry growth rates, etc.</font></font> etc.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- but all this is superficial. Once at an economic forum in Turkey, Turkish economists complained to me that everything is like in Europe, only the income of the population is 10 times lower. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúWe do not understand anything! The laws are the same, the climate is the same, production is developing dynamically - and people, who lived 10 times poorer than Europe, still live ... ‚Äù </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Russia with its tracing paper of the western standard is another example. Some part of Russia has joined the standard and consumes in a European way (another question is whether it is good or bad!). The remaining population does not believe in success, and, therefore, even in the most favorable conditions leads a lifestyle of losers.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In Russia, there is a situation where whiners drown each other, aggravate their disasters with their extreme pessimism, exchange it like videotapes with each other. That is why the volpinist in Russia will be in more difficult conditions than in the West, where everything is permeated with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãsuccess, and must at first set himself lighter loads than the European. So you have the desire. It can be recorded for self-control - or a good fix for memory. It should be (that is, seem to you) realistic, not too dramatically change your life, be very cold-rational without any admixture of lust.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Suppose a modest employee receives 8 thousand rubles a month. One day, he picked up a volpinist paper (a kind of placebo) and wrote on it: ‚ÄúFrom next year I will receive 10 thousand rubles a month, or 120 thousand rubles a year.‚Äù </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Now think about what kind of placebo can be used to achieve the goal? What actions will convince you that you can earn more? What bets should be made in the hope of luck? This is not needed by the Universe, for which your request is nothing, it is necessary for you to be self-persuasive. You need to be aware that the Universe will give you what you ask for and without any action on your part, unless lust submits a treacherous application for "the difficulty of receiving."</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The more difficult it seems to us to achieve any result, the more difficult it is for us in reality. Some are easy, playfully get a diploma of the university, others with a great rattle. Some jokingly become candidates of science - others take a lifetime to protect. Some people lying on the couch earn millions, others in the eternal running and bustle and can not scrape the bread. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Do not lust! Do not tell yourself ‚Äúit would be nice‚Äù - know that this is what awaits you there, and try to bring this knowledge closer to the maximum of calm. You are not worried about the stash in the closet, because you know exactly where it is and how much is in it. The same knowledge about the future as about the past - without experiences and passions, with the distinctness of the chronicler - this is the pinnacle of volpinism.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You think of the future as if you recall the past. According to the scheme: ‚ÄúYes, by the way, next week I will find an unregistered one thousand! What is it to spend? Can I put in a bank or buy a gift for my wife? ‚Äù </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">To get rid of lust, from the painful fear of not fulfilling a desire, I recommend my personal method -‚Äú shifting priorities ‚Äù. This is when a person, in order not to think about money, for example, </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">with obsession flows into, say, gardening (very important for Russia). He has a headache all day long - where to get seeds, how to fertilize the beds, how to grow super-plugs - and somewhere around the edge of consciousness, on the periphery, a little thought dawns about ‚Äúby the way, those 300 thousand next month will fall so suddenly ... wherever place them! Oh, not up to them now, the seedlings wither ... "</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you are a fan of a garden, a sports team, or some kind of scientific department, then they will do bad things - after all, the principle of ‚Äúexcitement for ...‚Äù provides for ‚Äúcomplication in that ...‚Äù. Let the seedlings wither in you - but 300 thousand will come at the right time. Maybe, of course, and vice versa - the seedlings will grow for glory, and the money will not come. So you could not switch your fears to devouring another object, the fear of poverty turned out to be stronger. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you analyze the rich people you know, you will definitely see some kind of ‚Äústicking‚Äù passion, which often seems ridiculous to you. What would he care about football if he has a billion-dollar turnover of the company? But it is football that loads his ‚Äúworm of doubt‚Äù and does not allow him to chew on the main thing, to chew on the case.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Our world, if we drop the illusion of the material, will be the intricate crossroads of many wills and religions. In business, your will must be stronger than the will of the buyer and the will of the competitor. It is the duel on the inner side of reality, the volitional confrontation (which is best illustrated by the Russian game ‚Äúpeepers‚Äù - when the eyes are in the eye, and who is the first to blink) decides the essence of the matter. The name of the product and its quality are all secondary placebo, lottery tickets, which, depending on your will, can win or lose.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Anyone who has been in business will be happy to confirm: trade does not depend on the goods, but on the seller. One person manages to sell utter trash, and the other is sitting on gold, and at half price em cannot sell. One cleverly implements the unnecessary, and the other and the necessary is not able to sell. What is the matter? </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Externally - in psychology, that one is a hammer, and the other is constrained, unsure, depressed, but look more closely - why is that? Is the answer obvious - the first is a man of ‚Äúlong will‚Äù and the second is a ‚Äúself-assembled loser‚Äù; </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I often witnessed the transformation of timid and nailed people when they had some kind of ‚Äúplacebo‚Äù they needed ‚Äî when they began to think that found a magical sword kladenets, and now it is omnipotent.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A graduate student suddenly defended himself, becoming a lion - he thought he was strong now. From what? From a worthless piece of paper that does not help another? Or from the faith that it is this person invested EXACTLY in this subject? </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Remember that it is not in the subject force, but in your faith. Not an amulet, not a talisman protect, bring happiness, but a mental image of power connected with them. The subject is always a ‚Äúplacebo‚Äù, a dummy, and in other hands it will be a worthless trifle. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But at the first stage it is useful to mystify yourself. ‚ÄúI signed an agreement with Petrenko, now I can do everything, everything is in my hands ...‚Äù If you really believe this, then an agreement with Petrenko will be your lucky card. If in doubt, paper will be empty.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When I was a deputy, I knew two assistants of deputies, let's call them ‚ÄúIvanov‚Äù and ‚ÄúPetrov‚Äù. So, the same deputy assistant maid brought Ivanov an excellent business and expansion of opportunities, and Petrova served only for free use of public transport. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Somehow Ivanov, in a circle of mutual friends, began to boast that he was ‚Äúan assistant deputy‚Äù and ‚Äúhe could do a lot.‚Äù - C'mon! - Petrov‚Äôs acquaintances answered - We know a man, he is also an assistant, and this did not give a damn thing to him!</font></font><br>  Frontier growth.  Being engaged in volpinizmom, you must establish yourself lines of growth.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In your enrichment, you will move from one line to another, jumping higher and higher. If there is a recession somewhere, it means that you need to return to the original indicator, you set the bar a bit high ... </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The frontier must always be in your consciousness, and at the same time not be in the foreground. The best thing is to drive him into the subconscious, not to think about him, but vaguely to feel. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I will share my method: I wrote a certain number (my own milestone) on different pieces of paper, in organizers, on the handset, at production meetings, in ministers for receiving, etc. All the time only a number, without comment, without undue clarification. I have taught myself that this number is obvious in the future, that it is mine, belongs to me by right, that I must get used to it, and will not be surprised when it appears in my checkbook.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Almost always worked. At the same time, when assigning a number, I didn‚Äôt think at the last stages of my business career where it would come from, that is, I didn‚Äôt cling to the placebo of the fussy-fussy magical actions of a businessman. I just knew that the circumstances would be such that this whole number would impose on me with all its irreversible course, and I would only have to accept it. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You can follow in my footsteps, you can think up your own mnemonic way - but remember! There are no pieces of paper and not numbers - the mind, the thought, everything else ‚Äî the placebo. If you try to mockly test my method, and with a laugh you find that it does not work, you will program failure. I have already said that facts are a pliable thing, the Universe will provide you with any number of facts to support your theory of the world.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The technique can begin to operate only when you use it with faith in success, when you plan your purchases in advance for money that has not yet arrived, when you build in advance a shed for cattle that have not yet been born. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is the state of mind of representatives of the nation, and not some kind of economic or social system that provides the nation with wealth. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Communism did not give wealth, and the market will not give it either - it's all nothing more than a placebo for the consumer spirit. The availability of money is generally a non-market concept, because the market is aimed at maximizing</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">saving money. If you have soap, and I have an awl, then we could buy them from each other. But, besides mutual desire, it is necessary that everybody except for sewing and soap also has a coin. Or barter - without money - but in macroeconomics it is very difficult to implement. It turns out the magic circle - to start production, you need money, and to become a consumer, you need money. That is, we have not yet begun to produce or consume, and the money is already needed. Who will give them - if not production and not consumption?</font></font><br>  Universe.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At the beginning there was a word, Logos, a thought - as if planned abundance - and only then, on a wave of optimism and expectations of the best, on a wave of a bold dream, material well-being comes. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">5. About good and evil spirit </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Here I would like to once again warn about the dangers of the knowledge that you have learned. It is not without reason that I divide God, as a creative and personal principle, from the Universe, as a faceless apparatus for producing illusions.</font></font> In fact.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You saw the world without matter, energy, space, as it is - the world of three persons: Your Spirit, Good Spirit and Evil Spirit. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The world was always like this, no matter if you know it or not - you are always in the space between the Absolute of Good and the Absolute of evil, in an intermediate suspended state. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Money is a substance absolutely neutral, they become good or evil only in your hands. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Actually, money is not a coin or a piece of paper (placebo), but a measure of your power in the modern world. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you are rich, you become like a magician, capable of executing and pardoning, causing rain and dispersing clouds, erecting palaces and destroying cities. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Do not flatter yourself with the neutrality of the "Matrix" - the Universe. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It gives all without parsing, according to your application. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But the Evil Spirit is behind every volpinist control</font></font></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/8406/">https://habr.com/ru/post/8406/</a></p>
