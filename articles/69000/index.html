In the middle lane, where many of us live, summer replaces spring, autumn comes after summer, etc.  But if you fly to where it is always cold or always hot, we will fall into an unusual environment.  Nature itself gives such an opportunity, non-pattern.  And then, sometimes, what a cataclysm will strike or surprise with the weather.  Then in Africa the snow will fall, then Europe will flood, then another hurricane will erase human buildings from the face of the Earth. <br><br>  This is all saying. <br><br>  For the human soul (forgive me for being back to theology and esoteric) there is nothing worse than living your precious time in a stereotypical and uncreative way.

      I see that there are a lot of people on Habr√© who, realizing this, at one time decided to live not like most people live.  Live in pleasure doing your favorite thing.  To create, to rejoice, to do something unusual and unexpected, to allow yourself nonsense and not to think about what someone will say: ‚ÄúSome fool.  Would live like us, and not twitch.  Life still puts you in its place, you will see. " <br><br>  Being crazy isn't so bad.  At one time, when the desire to break free from the cycle of everyday life was growing in me, I began to occasionally allow myself something that can be considered not characteristic of an adult.  No, do not think anything like that!  Secret: I just allowed myself to smile on the street if I wanted to smile.  Shhhhh.  Only to anyone!  And when I started to say that I was some kind of strange, I understood that I was moving in the right direction. <br><br>  Rave!  But many people are so influential in their beliefs about what is right and what is wrong, that a person smiling on the street is perceived almost as a psychopath (I‚Äôm not saying that this person can still jump on one leg with happiness. Then exactly 03 will cause ). <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <i>They said that I was crazy, and I replied that they were crazy, but damn them, there were more of them, and they won.</i>  Nathaniel Lee, an English Damaturg, whom friends put in the house of the insane. <br><br>  Creative people suffer greatly from imposed and sometimes hand-made patterns.  I remember the programs that were watched on TV (this is where the main template maker, like all media in principle) is about famous actors, TV hosts.  One actor - one role.  Sometimes it happens that a certain stereotype is attached to the actor after the shooting, after which he is offered the same type of roles: villain, hero-lover, comedian ... But a real actor cannot play only one type.  This is not a development, there is no way out of emotions, there is no realization of talent, there are no colors and tones!  That was Louis de Phineas, who, by the way, played jazz music perfectly - everyone laughed at his comedic roles, the current French comedies are tight compared to the comedies of those times, and yet he was very unhappy in his life.  What is it like to go on stage and play a funny character?  Many clowns in life are sullen and inhospitable people ... If you have actors in your social circle, if you watch them on TV, you have probably heard how difficult it is to reverse the prejudice of the masses that you can play other roles. <br><br>  Recently showed a program about Leonid Yakubovich.  The presenter of the ‚ÄúField of Miracles‚Äù tried to escape from the captivity of his template, tried to create serious programs, but was not allowed to do this, the people simply did not perceive him as a serious presenter.  To twist the drum, to try on the turban, to think about words ‚Äî yes, this is it, and analyst to lead, raise national problems doesn‚Äôt fit in somehow.  Although Leonid really wanted to make his transfer ... But I would not be upset in his place, as there is always a way out.  a little further consider the options. <br><br>  The same Andrei Malakhov and "Let them talk."  I am sure that he was fed up with this program, these constant squabbles and cries in the studio, similar situations, talk about nothing, but he was so attached to this environment that he became synonymous with the program.  Visiting his show recently was Alan Pizz, an expert in gestures and facial expressions.  As a graphic example, he was asked to comment on the gestures of some public people on the video, including Andrew himself on the recording of programs.  Alan clearly defined the behavior of Malakhov in the studio when communicating with the participants of the show, signs that spoke of unimaginable longing and boredom. <br><br>  And famous people have problems, and we have such problems.  I remember my teenage years.  School, lyceum, university ... The change of environment, the transition from one social group to another was characterized by a drastic change in my pattern of behavior.  Sharp - does not mean cardinal.  It is rather a comparison with how hard it was for me to change something in my model of behavior within the established circle of communication, and an easy and painless transformation of behavior during the transition from one environment to another, where you do not know.  Do you understand what I'm talking about.  It is very difficult to change within the framework of the environment where certain behaviors are expected from you.  Do you want a ‚Äúclever man and an excellent student‚Äù to do something like this ... to shout with a good foul language, climb a tree, bite.  For sure!  But he cannot, he is ‚Äúa good girl and an excellent student,‚Äù and this behavior will upset the teacher and mother.  And bad guy (my type)?  He also yearns for love and respect.  But everyone expects bad things from him.  And believe me, I have them.  He provides these bad things to the full.  That's how we live. <br><br>  What to do and who is to blame?  I would answer the second question like this: no one is to blame.  This is our world, we form it ourselves, according to our own understanding.  This is an objective reality.  But always, each specific person can create his own place in this world on his own.  You just need a little awareness to understand why everything works so and not otherwise. <br><br>  For example, I would recommend Leonid Yakubovich before launching his serious program (several issues seem to have come out).  The mistake was that he tried to change the image without proper preparation of his audience.  Everyone is used to seeing the dummy, forever cheerful, joking, compliant, humorous.  And suddenly he was gone.  Remember the cartoon, in which the elk on the horns first asked for a bug, then a spider, then a frog or someone else.  Over time, taking advantage of the kindness of the moose, the whole forest people registered there, including the bear :), and they began to dictate their conditions, where to go, what to do.  Until the elk in the fall did not throw off the horns.  And then, poor fellow, dropping all this cargo sadly replied to the stunned inhabitants of the horns: ‚ÄúBut nevertheless, it was awkwardly somehow turned out ...‚Äù And so in life.  The people said indignantly: ‚ÄúWhere ?!‚Äù And Lenya was returned to his place.  And it was necessary to do this: to launch Leonid's video in an image that would shock the audience, split the shell of his ‚Äúhalf wonder‚Äù, stunned and stunned the target viewer.  If necessary, there may be several such clips, all in different images, you can duplicate in the media, because Leonid was printed in a newspaper in camouflage somewhere in the Caucasus region, but it was one little article and she didn‚Äôt have such a goal, so by. <br><br>  I was asked to soap the soap on Santa Claus, add to the image of trash for the cartoon.  There will be an order, there will be ideas.  No problems.  As an example, and for the author of the letter the plot: Santa Claus rides on a sleigh, on his reindeer along the road.  Over the bag with gifts.  He is caught up with a bus full of children.  Children rejoice, squeak, wave their grandfathers hands, waiting for gifts.  Santa Claus shows ‚Äúfuck‚Äù, spurs his reindeer and leaves.  Children in tears. <br><br>  In fact, here we are talking about the fact that the usual stereotype breaks down, collapses.  Shocking.  This image can be unpleasant to someone, but it is the reaction, the surprise that allows you to achieve the goal.  It's like a Benetton ad, plots of the South Park, etc. <br><br>  Shl.  Break stereotypes, allow yourself pranks, do not accustom others to your image. <br><br>  Good luck! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/69000/">https://habr.com/ru/post/69000/</a></p>
