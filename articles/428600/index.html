  <section class="page js-page"><h1>SSD with special effects or something that was missing for modding - HyperX FURY RGB drive overview</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> It was impossible not to notice that in recent years more and more devices are equipped with LED backlighting.  Even 10-15 years ago, modding the PC was a time consuming task - everything was done with the hands of the grandfather‚Äôs tools available on the balcony (in the garage, in the closet - underline).  And the highlight was exactly the backlight - most often it was assembled from cold cathode fluorescent lamps.  It was impossible to call them compact, because in addition to the hard transparent case inside the system, it was necessary to place the power button and the inverter.  But all this is a well-forgotten past that some users recall with warm feelings.  Now, finding components with illumination is not a problem at all.  Rather, finding something without backlighting is a difficult task.  At first, they began to introduce the backlighting into motherboards, then video cards, chassis, power supplies, RAM ... and even cable pads from power supplies to components went into action!  And now the solid-state drives have arrived.  It is about the last component from this list that we will talk about today, and the <a href="http://hyperx.gg/HabrSSDFuryRGB">FURY RGB SSD, a</a> new product from HyperX, will be the test subject. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/br/13/de/br13deng5o1gd4ijjfgapeqkth0.jpeg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Many users are neutral or negative about RGB backlight components - they say, the computer is a box under the table, which you see only when you turn on or connect something from the periphery.  In part, you can say so.  But this will be relevant only for workplaces in offices and a certain number of PC owners - those who have no requirements for the appearance of the system.  Modern gamers, enthusiasts and modders consider quite the opposite - now they have at their disposal not only many specialized tools for assembling systems (for example, devices for bending acrylic tubes for liquid cooling systems, special devices for dismantling all cables for their braiding, etc.) and a huge number of components for modding projects of any complexity.  Shells without transparent walls are becoming harder to find.  And every year there are more and ‚Äúbench‚Äù models - when absolutely all the components are in sight.  RGB backlit motherboards are plentiful.  Video cards and power supplies - too.  What can I say, recently were presented and overlays on power cables with customizable RGB backlight!  But something is still missing.  Not enough.  Now we have SSD - <a href="http://hyperx.gg/HabrSSDFuryRGB">FURY RGB</a> from HyperX. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kr/ct/my/krctmyo4qtno3vv-yot_3czzsim.jpeg">

      In general, who wished - waited.  Now the whole system can be made to glow as you want - the mode of operation and the color of the backlight can be configured with the help of proprietary motherboard software.  Supports work with software ASUS AURA, Gigabyte RGB Fusion, MSI Mystic Light and ASRock Polychrome RGB.  These technologies began to emerge with the release of Intel 100 series chipsets and AMD 970 series.  With each update of the line began to appear more and more opportunities to configure RGB devices. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hf/cz/-r/hfcz-rsaa3k6p2tyqq_1ofx1h38.jpeg"><br><br>  Depending on the capabilities of the motherboard, two configuration options are available.  The first is when the drive is defined as an additional RGB tape.  So, in fact, it is, because it connects to the appropriate connector on the board - 12V + RGB.  Such a connector may be one, and there may be several, it all depends on the model.  The location also depends on the model of the board - basically, they are located above or below.  But it is important not to confuse - there are also connectors with 5 V power supply for addressable tapes - they are not suitable for connecting this drive!  But it will be difficult to confuse - manufacturers put the appropriate marking next to the counter. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/2p/pn/eg/2ppnegmongrp-g5ecfuz0r7sl00.jpeg"><br><br>  The length of the cable to synchronize the backlight is enough to hold it and behind the motherboard to the topmost connector.  In addition, the cable is made in such a way so as not to take away from you the opportunity to connect another tape - you can connect another RGB device of a similar type to a special branch. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/z1/7o/p_/z17op_rckvme3ebnnslpzufdjdy.jpeg"><br><br>  Thus, the ASUS AURA settings menu looks like - the backlight of the drive can be configured independently of the backlight of the motherboard and other devices. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rv/fy/d0/rvfyd0m8tlawflhkiyh2fwobtcg.png"><br><br>  If the motherboard is from a budget segment, then only the option of a general backlight setting can be available - the drive will not be defined as a separate device. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wa/ot/xz/waotxzcqwpytr_wfa9vfk5dmt8e.png"><br><br>  In the case of Aorus (Gigabyte), the configuration menu looks like this.  Again, the drive is seen as a separate RGB device (LED_C2 or LED_C1). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/oq/ok/dw/oqokdwjz0aysfozmedze-1ka_gk.png"><br><br>  And what will happen if you do not connect an additional cable to the corresponding connector on the motherboard?  In this case, the drive will always glow red.  When the cable is connected, the previously selected backlight mode will be used again. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xh/mi/n-/xhmin-2ilezrrck0x21_vawtug8.jpeg"><br><br>  Well, we figured it out.  Now we need to find out how everything is arranged inside and outside.  On the shelves of stores and to us in the hands of the drive gets packed in a small box, decorated in white and red colors.  Its front side shows a drive, an RGB logo, and the memory on which it is based ‚Äî 3D TLC ‚Äî is mentioned. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/i7/wo/tt/i7wott3tpjz4rei35uppd6kvxk4.jpeg"><br><br>  HyperX <a href="http://hyperx.gg/HabrSSDFuryRGB">FURY RGB SSD</a> features: <br>  <b>Interface:</b> 2.5 ‚Äù <br>  <b>Interface:</b> SATA Rev.  3.0 (6 Gb / s) - backward compatible with SATA Rev.  2.0 (3 Gb / s) <br>  <b>Capacity:</b> 240 GB, 480 GB, 960 GB <br>  <b>Controller:</b> Marvell 88SS1074 <br>  <b>NAND:</b> 3D TLC <br>  <b>Sequential read / write</b> <br>  240 GB - 960 GB - up to 550/480 MB / s <br>  <b>Power consumption</b> <br>  0.2 W in standby mode / 0.6 W on average / 1.2 W (maximum) read / 2.5 W (maximum) write <br>  <b>Dimensions:</b> 100.14 mm x 69.85 mm x 9.5 mm <br>  <b>Operating temperature:</b> 0 ¬∞ C ~ 70 ¬∞ C <br>  <b>Storage temperature:</b> -40 ¬∞ C ~ 85 ¬∞ C <br>  <b>Weight:</b> 165 g <br>  <b>The</b> maintained <b>vibrations during the work:</b> 2,17G on peak (7 - 800 Hz) <br>  <b>Vibration withstand in calm mode:</b> 20G at the peak (10 - 2000 Hz) <br>  <b>Expected duration:</b> 1 million hours of time between failures <br>  <b>Warranty / support:</b> Three-year limited warranty with free technical support <br>  Number of write cycles (TBW with JEDEC JESD219A workload): <br>  240 GB - 120 TB <br>  480 GB - 240 TB <br>  960 GB - 480 TB <br><br>  The bundle is somewhat different from the usual for solid-state drives.  In the box you can find user manuals (and it will be necessary for those who have not yet encountered the connection of RGB devices to the motherboard) and a couple of leaflets with information about other HyperX products, including backlit options. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/y2/vv/ie/y2vviezyjqddmsdi6bjqyuhy-pe.jpeg"><br><br>  Also in the box is a license key for Acronis True Image HD, a proprietary sticker and the very unusual accessory - a cable for connecting an SSD to the motherboard to control the backlight. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/2d/ap/8g/2dap8gfidopoxpf3kunlwhzrxly.jpeg"><br><br>  Connect the drive with three cables - power, data and lighting. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ie/df/-2/iedf-29isfasvsrukwk_fk664dw.jpeg"><br><br>  The body of the drive is almost entirely made of metal.  Only the black X-shaped insert is made of plastic. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lw/cf/x-/lwcfx-hreaezthhatvcn1wvvqbq.jpeg"><br><br>  But the other side is completely metal.  The weight of the drive, as you could see from the characteristics published above, is large enough.  But this is not so simple - the housing plays the role of a radiator to remove heat from the internal components. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pf/nt/3r/pfnt3rttbgmt0imevlyq-vpd5im.jpeg"><br><br>  It comes into contact with them with the use of a rather thick thermal pad: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/og/-v/ii/og-viijycwmgd2s5ybb2ha-gqrg.jpeg"><br><br>  Is it necessary?  Judge for yourself - with constant activity, the hull is almost uniformly heated to 48 degrees.  The photos below were taken in a completely passive mode - that is, in the worst conditions, which will not be in the system unit, because during assembly it is important to properly organize the air flow, which will cool all components, including the solid-state drive. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_x/at/3d/_xat3djde926ziwxo-0p_4c8cn4.jpeg"><br><br>  The front side is also uniformly heated, which indicates good heat transfer from the internal elements to the body. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8w/sr/9a/8wsr9acy0lfthfrkcvlc_0sibi8.jpeg"><br><br>  The backlight is implemented as a set of 75 RGB LEDs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qy/0e/pc/qy0epcwc1eabhdern5n5zyrpzze.jpeg"><br><br>  All major components are soldered on the other side of the board. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pz/ut/yc/pzutyc4jjfll7r_gtgonaty8-rw.jpeg"><br><br>  The heart of the drive is the Marvell 88SS1074 controller.  The buffer memory is D1216MCABXGGBS (128 MB, DDR3, 1600 MHz). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/q_/vh/jz/q_vhjzg7c7rryk507xozn7drk5m.jpeg"><br><br>  The volume of the model under consideration (240 GB) is typed with four FH64B08UCT1-60 microcircuits.  This is a 64-layer BiCS3 3D TLC memory from Toshiba. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1w/lt/3b/1wlt3bpkuoxqbr8i4wq7_duqho0.jpeg"><br><br>  As for performance, for games and standard applications for working with multimedia it is enough.  In fact, the disc works at the limit of the SATA Rev interface.  3.0 <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/m6/v4/mp/m6v4mp9yberdhg9nngx3wayiddi.png"><br><br>  And a couple of benchmarks demonstrating the speed of work with blocks of different sizes and with different parameters of the queue depth and flows. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/j-/lg/jw/j-lgjwbd8tikwfatxy7wdve6_2a.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/l8/4q/uq/l84quq-h70rbvjkcz-fy2nbh0ke.png"><br><br>  What is the result? <br>  <a href="http://hyperx.gg/HabrSSDFuryRGB">HyperX FURY RGB</a> is a drive designed for gamers, modders and enthusiasts who are far from the last place in their system, but rather at the head.  True, to become a modder today, you need only straight arms, desire and useful materials that will tell you something new and useful.  And everything else can be found in stores - there is a lot of good for modding now and it is practically not difficult to find suitable components.  Returning to the SSD ... What is most interesting, the reviewed drive can offer not only a beautiful wrapper, but also a delicious candy inside - for games and a set of usual software, it will be enough without any questions.  Want to be more productive - these are just NVMe solutions, which will cost more and will not be installed as a decorative element in the case.  Neutral body color and bright customizable RGB backlighting - exactly what was missing in cool modding projects or gaming systems, components of which are visible! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kw/8y/5g/kw8y5g3iqlhjekbklmkldqcmeko.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sw/fa/rr/swfarrrwa2cn4ybd3fqbrcetwbg.jpeg"><br><br>  Autumn promotions, discounts and deals on the <a href="http://hyperx.gg/HabrSSDFuryRGB">HyperX Fury RGB</a> SSD: <br>  - Until November 14 in Ulmart - <a href="http://hyperx.gg/UlmartFuryRGB">here</a> <br>  - Until November 15 OnlineTrade - <a href="http://hyperx.gg/OnlinetradeFuryRGB">here</a> <br><br>  For more information on Kingston products, visit <a href="https://bit.ly/2zhL0oH">the company's official website</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/428600/">https://habr.com/ru/post/428600/</a></p>
