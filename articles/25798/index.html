  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Adventure of a domainer on the web :). Comparative analysis of Ukrainian domain registrars</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Wandering through the countless websites of companies offering domain registration and hosting services, I suddenly had the idea to rank the most worthy companies.  I am sure that the Internet is full of the same undecided users, like myself, with whom this article will probably open up new horizons for evaluating the work of domestic hoster providers.  I will not be particularly shy, the work was done a lot: sending letters to the registrars with a list of questions on behalf of the ‚Äúordinary user‚Äù, calling these registrars to clarify the stupid questions (for excerpts of support), analyzing the results and so on.  I dare to remind you that while compiling this rating, my goals included an independent assessment of the work of domain registration companies, and not banal PR.  I have nothing to do with any of the companies that participated in the survey. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, I have selected 18 Ukrainian domain registrars, which are more or less in demand by consumers.  Also, a general list of criteria was compiled, according to which further analysis will be conducted. <br><br>  List of companies selected to participate in the ranking. <br><br>  hostbizua.com/ - HostBizUA

The quality and speed of responses by e-mail.</strong> <br><br>  I, who presented myself as a private entrepreneur of one of the travel companies and ‚Äúlike‚Äù who does not understand anything in the intricacies of the domain industry, wanted to get clear answers to the questions asked.  By my standards, a good registrar should give quality answers, especially if he is interested in a potential client.  6 out of 18 gave ‚Äúchewed‚Äù answers and in the shortest possible time (5-10 minutes after sending the letter), which satisfied me in every sense.  The rest of the answers came later (after 1 2 hours).  Most registrars ‚Äúgot away‚Äù from my request with modestly-referential answers, not splashing on the words.  The points in the basket earned; Imena;  Redo;  Ethnohosting;  Adamant;  TanHost;  (the latter described the registration process step by step !!!) <br><br>  Particularly distressed Hvosting;  Ukrainian hosting and UaCom (the last 2 ignored my requests and phone calls altogether). <br><br>  <strong>2. Quality of answers by phone and loyalty (respect for a potential client).</strong> <br><br>  We are investigating further.  Now we evaluate the quality of the seport's answers by telephone, so to speak, oratory, which cannot be felt in the emails.  In principle, most of the operators were quite sane.  Cute girls on the phone from Imena, HostPro and Redo chatted with me, gently mentioning that they are happy to cooperate with me, lured into the ranks of customers!  It became nice!  Absolutely did not see the slightest interest in me, as in the client at FreeHost, as well as Hvosting.  - the raw and vague answers of support provoked outright indignation, and immediately told them what they were ‚Äúdiscouraged‚Äù by the friendly ‚Äúhmm ... thanks for the call, all the best‚Äù.  I was even more upset, because my rudeness was transferred to my address and it seems like I also turned out to be extreme.  Imhoster - the second day does not answer calls.  Those.  support ignores customers? <br><br>  <strong>3. Competence of the information provided and quality assurance (is it given at all by this registrar?)</strong> <br><br>  Regarding the competence of information, I can say that, in general, all operators were well aware of the information, except, of course, those who clearly ignored my attempts to ‚Äúmake friends‚Äù with this company (mentioned above).  Perhaps when answering my "stupid" questions, a bias was made on my "teapot-like" knowledge in the domain sphere, and therefore the operators did not load my brain with technical terms, but explained everything with simple human language, practically on my fingers.  One of the questions on my list was a question regarding guarantees of the quality work of my domains.  Yes, I do not argue, the issue with the background.  But, nevertheless, it is the best characterizes the registrar.  Unfortunately, 50% of registrars ignored the question of guarantees or unsubscribed very vaguely.  Judge for yourself, if the guarantee can be considered - ‚Äúcustomers like‚Äù or ‚Äúthe domain will work 100%‚Äù, then I would hardly have gone to such a registrar.  What guarantees a quality service, answered 4 registrars, the same number indicated the number of clients and the terms of work in the domain industry market, and 1 registrar honestly admitted that he did not give any guarantees. <br><br>  <strong>4. Availability of a control panel for domain management.</strong> <br><br>  All 18 registrars in one voice said that they provide a client control panel to manage the domain.  But with a few clarifications that the reconstruction is currently under way and this panel will not work until mid-June.  To the counter-question: ‚Äú... what operations can be performed using this panel?‚Äù Most of the recorders answered vaguely, and one of them struck my mind with a masterpiece response: ‚ÄúThe panel allows you to do EVERYTHING!‚Äù ... <br><br>  <strong>5. Completeness of information on the site</strong> <br><br>  The site is the face, its information is the soul.  And another's soul, as it is known darkness.  Overall rating for sites 4 with a minus.  On individual sites just got lost in search of the necessary information.  And on the Giga I could not find contacts.  UacCom, as mentioned above, cut itself off from the outside world and neither the correspondence nor the calls are responding. <br><br>  <strong>6 Interest.</strong> <br><br>  One of the last criteria for evaluating the list of registrars was interest in me, as in a potential client.  In conjunction with the criterion, there was also a slightly naive question ‚Äúwhat would you recommend‚Äù, which misled some registrars.  70% answered that it is my personal business, that the advice is inappropriate here, thus showing that they absolutely do not care what, how and where I am going to register.  The remaining 30% advised .com (apparently sensing the benefits).  In all likelihood, I probably would not register my business in this zone, but I personally personally caused a bit of confidence in the registrars to pay attention to my person. <br><br>  <strong>7. Rating table</strong> <br><br>  The table below is the final step in the overall registrar assessment.  Evaluation took place on a 5-point scale.  The lowest score is 2, the highest is 5. 0 points means that the registrar did not provide information on the above criteria. <br><br>  The table at <a href="http://domain.kiev.ua/index.php%3Fmodule%3Dnotes%26id%3D73">http://domain.kiev.ua/index.php?module=notes&amp;id=73</a> <br>  <strong>Rating differences.</strong> <br><br>  In principle, if we refer to the table of general assessment, the formal leaders are only a couple of points behind each other.  I will try to clarify the difference between them. <br><br>  1. TanHost - took the honorable first place.  This was given to him for his exceptional work of support and prompt response to requests.  The registrar fully meets all the requirements of a modern hosting provider. <br><br>  2. Imena - Not inferior in quality to TanHost.  The only difference is in some roughness of information on the company's website, in my opinion.  But all questions are easily solved both via email and by phone. <br><br>  3. Redo - Keeps up with Imena'mi.  The same high-quality and prompt response of the seport to applications.  All registration and maintenance rules comply with established standards. <br><br>  4. Adamant - Quality + quality assurance.  The only detail is the control panel, which is currently under reconstruction and can create some discomfort for users. <br><br>  5. UkrHosting - The quality of the response by email is a bit different from my notion of ‚Äúgood answer‚Äù.  But despite this, when dealing with customer support, all issues were resolved. <br><br>  <strong>Total</strong> <br><br>  So, after a deep analysis of the activities of each registrar, the five leaders of independent evaluations were clearly formed.  These are the best companies that provide high-quality services and show undisguised interest in their current and future customers. <br><br>  Good luck in choosing a registrar! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/25798/">https://habr.com/ru/post/25798/</a></p>
