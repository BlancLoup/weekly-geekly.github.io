At the same time, I am absolutely sure that there are great specialists in this profession. <br><br><h4>  What is good? </h4><br>  This profession has recently made in the open spaces of one disputed share of the land part a considerable leap, and we have specialists who are likely to interest and hire the coolest professionals, and freeloaders and lazy people to weed out.  They certainly exist, but as in many other industries they represent an honorable minority, seeking to scramble out of the framework of statistical error.  Some of the recruiters quietly become the heroes of jokes, which bring considerable pleasure to other characters of corporate humor.  Despite this, in no case should we deny that the situation is gradually changing for the better. <br><br><h4>  What is bad? </h4><br>  Anyone, even the most snotty and drowsy graduate of the personnel department, considers himself a real catcher of human souls and thoughts.  Armed with a medal for five years of impeccable imprisonment in high school auditoriums, the ‚Äúskills‚Äù of NLPertsev and a ‚Äúbig red folder,‚Äù such a recruiting specialist will terrorize the job portals, prepare the gigabytes of resumes and destroy the remnants of nerve cells of candidates for days and nights.

      In this topic, I will try to bring out some typical signs of a stupid ‚Äúheadhunter,‚Äù with the first hints on which your ears should be at the crown, and your low-start legs in the direction of the exit.  Why waste time and nerves?  Employers and recruiters - note. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Requirement of redundant recommendations </h4><br>  The naive assumption that a large number of recommendations characterizes a quality specialist indirectly indicates that the recruiter is serious about the opinion of an authoritative and not very majority.  The more the candidate will be recommended, the better, although the class specialist characterizes only his previous work and achievements. <br><br><h4>  Stamps </h4><br>  If a recruiter tirelessly rushes with ordinary clich√©s, quotes popular statements to the place and not to the place, most likely it seems to him that he is a notorious scholar and the fact of his indulgence before talking to you suggests that the main task of such a personnel specialist is to demonstrate their abilities.  In fact, this behavior leads to the opposite conclusions regarding the mental abilities of such a character. <br><br>  Really cool recruiters speak the simplest language, and the purpose of your conversation for them is to obtain the necessary information.  This recruiter has only two mutually exclusive goals - to hire or not to hire. <br><br><h4>  One-man show </h4><br>  Own loud and confident voice brings them into a state close to orgasmic.  During the entire interview you may not even have the opportunity to speak in detail.  An indirect sign that the recruiter does not listen to you is that after any of your statements, the recruiter returns to his previous thesis, without any amendments to what you said, as if you didn‚Äôt say anything.  Who can be hired by a cadre specialist who all the interview was engaged in enhancing his own CSW?  In fact, the total number of words spoken by the recruiter should be several times less than that of the candidate.  Why does the personnel officer talk about himself, because he already works in an organization? <br><br><h4>  Inability to answer basic questions and ignorance </h4><br>  Your most simple and direct question about the activities of the organization, the mountain recruiter can only answer in the most vague wording.  At such a moment, suspicions about the competence of this specialist immediately arise, since the personnel specialist must have a clear idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe company and its activities.  It is possible that his ideas are seriously simplified and schematic, but their absence from a normal employee is unacceptable.  A professional recruiter fully understands the market, company and customer needs of the company. <br><br><h4>  Carelessness </h4><br>  Bad recruiters are as careless as the wind in their head, and as quick.  For them, everything that happens is short-term.  Write "+1" in the diary "done" for them more important.  We know with you that everything related to personnel work is related to long-term tasks. <br><br><h4>  Forcing additional offers </h4><br>  Assertiveness is not the most important quality of a personnel specialist.  Pressing and forcing to not previously agreed proposals and conditions should tell you that something is wrong either with a vacancy or with the company as a whole.  A good recruiter will never, by his behavior, give a reason to doubt the seriousness of the intentions and thoroughness of the company, even if there really are some problems with the vacancy. <br><br><h4>  Selfishness </h4><br>  Bad recruits once again do not lift a finger.  When the assigned tasks of hiring employees with grief in half, nevertheless, are completed, they are engaged in anything, but not only in their work.  A good recruiter is always on the lookout.  Upon a sudden request from the manager for hiring additional staff, the recruiter will submit his ‚Äúhomework‚Äù as soon as possible: send a pack of well-prepared letters to pre-selected candidates and, after making a few calls to the most desired job seekers, agree on an interview plan with the department interested in the candidate. <br><br>  If you are faced with any of the described signs, then try as quickly as possible to retire under any convenient pretext.  Why do you need a job in a company unable to hire a normal HR department specialist?  If you are the head of the company and you have such an HR-specialist, drive him to the neck! <br><br>  Why am I so angry at HR?  Because they, for the most part, do not even realize the full depth of their responsibility (or rather irresponsibility) to the organization.  Any smallest miscalculation of the recruiter is invisible in the short term and extremely toxic in the long term. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/293750/">https://habr.com/ru/post/293750/</a></p>
