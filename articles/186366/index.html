The long awaited Moto X again shed some light.  Now it has become known that, apart from exclusively (in fact almost, for some details will still be from Korea) of American production, an affordable price and a ClearPixel camera will be another chip.  This is the possibility of complete customization. <br><br>  It is no longer just a matter of changing color panels.  Although 16 options - really inspires.  Nokia has already used a similar chip.  Even more - they made them removable.  Although how it affected the sales of Lumia 820 and 520, or on the lids themselves, is hard to say.  There is no such official statistics.  It is possible to cite only <a href="http://winphonenews.ru/2013/06/interes-k-nokia-lumia-520-prodolzhaet-rasti-14054/">the popularity of 520</a> (it is very budget), and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/177419/">about the finov's windscreen in general</a> .  It is also worth considering the popularity of new Asha devices with the same chip in the third world countries and developing ones.

      But the choice of materials from which the device will be made, the configuration of "hardware" and software - this is really a good chip. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h5>  Why do you need it </h5><br><br>  In the first case we are talking about wood, metal or Kevlar.  The problem is really painful, especially for those who are switching from regular phones to smartphones.  Change iron to plastic, but still not very high quality, causing tactile rejection and just smelly (rubberized), do not really want.  And there are not so many offers on the market.  In addition to HTC, but LG recently no one does not release anything like this.  Kevlar is in principle more acceptable plastic replacement.  It is more reliable and resistant to damage, but it is pleasant to the touch and does not stink.  Overlooking the controversial.  Therefore, the metal is still relevant, especially since the heating of the processor is increasingly minimized.  And this is essentially its only weak place (you can still remember the problems with paint, hello to the fifth black Apple).  Wood is also important, although there is more aesthetics than practical use. <br><br>  Similar pieces with wood and metal were practiced before.  But these were premium phones from Kenwood, Benq Siemens and of course Vertu.  And naturally, the option was more on preferences in stones and the type of metal, i.e.  it was more about taste than practical convenience. <br><br>  As for the second option, on the one hand - it was not clearly and clearly announced, and on the other - to some extent it is also present in other devices.  The ability to choose phones with different memory sizes, processor types (hello Samsung Galaxy S4), size and screen resolution is no longer a novelty.  Another question is that this is partially found in many, but whole - nowhere.  It did not become a system and a rule. <br><br>  With the third aspect, that is to say the setting up of the software, the situation is the most sad.  It seems to be the least difficulty with him.  Customize Android, even change the application in the firmware is not a problem.  But every time to delete a bunch of unnecessary pre-installed applications (and not all is possible, in the same last Galaxy they devour more than half of the RAM), automatically enabled modes, functions are not very convenient.  But those that are needed, no.  Given the trend that smartphones are usually changed more than it was with mobile (the rate of progress has increased in any way).  That and do it come more often.  Not once every five years, but once every three years, and sometimes more often.  And if we consider the combination of the class of smartphones and tablets and the creation of a heap of subclasses, and most importantly - an increase in the demand for them, it is still problematic. <br><br><h5>  How will it look like </h5><br><br>  The first and long step Moto will be the conquest of the US home market.  He and secured, and large.  And it will be easier to technically secure the order and debug the system (hello to Nexus orders).  Therefore, apply online and pay will be easier.  Then there will be localization, work with local points of delivery and, I think, will come out without problems on the European and Asian markets. <br><br>  A problem may arise with physical characteristics (whether the processor is the same, the color, the physical damage, etc.).  However, their verification is a traditional problem of goods with delivery and the responsible companies solve them. <br><br><h5>  How did the market change </h5><br><br>  But this is the most interesting.  Then the story goes, but it can be easily supported by <a href="https://www.google.com/finance%3Fchdnp%3D1%26chdd%3D1%26chds%3D1%26chdv%3D1%26chvs%3Dmaximized%26chdeh%3D0%26chfdeh%3D0%26chdet%3D1366228800000%26chddm%3D606364%26chls%3DIntervalBasedLine%26cmpto%3DNYSE:NOK%3BNYSE:PHG%3BNASDAQ:LOGI%3BNYSE:GM%3BNYSE:CAJ%26cmptdms%3D0%3B0%3B0%3B0%3B0%26q%3DNYSE:SNE%26ntsp%3D0%26ei%3Dj2t1UeCnEqX5wAPzDQ">statistics on the shares of companies on the stock exchange</a> or sales of smartphones (it is more difficult to find in one place).  But in order not to overload the presentation and not to mix everything into one, we refrain from detailed digital education. <br><br>  Previously, the revolution in the market of mobile smartphones was solely due to technical innovations and the differentiation of the market.  At first, Nokia captured the market because their phones were the most reliable, well caught and easy to use.  Their innovativeness was, frankly, not the biggest on the market, even on average.  Motorola and the rest of the numerous players competed with them for the same characteristics. <br><br>  Everything shifted a bit when Sony Ericsson split off part of the market with its Walkman and Cyber-shot (W, K, C-series) with their much better sound, music applications and camera quality, respectively. <br><br>  Then came the online communicators and Blackberry came to the fore.  In fact, not only businessmen began to buy them for their convenient keyboard and services (encrypted mail and all that), but also young people.  Few people remember, but they often climbed with them, as they do now with apple smarts, emphasizing status. <br><br>  Well, yes, I started to sweep them all out with an Iphone with its touchscreen and a normal system with a bunch of applications, at that moment competitive Symbian.  The first one had problems with the camera and with the case, but with each new model it increasingly captured the market.  Initially, he positioned himself as a killer of communicators, therefore a significant part of the Nokia market, Vertu (indirectly rather) and Blackberry, although to a lesser extent.  But then he had to replace Nokia itself on the throne, which he almost did. <br><br>  But the Iphone did not last long.  It is now almost completely demolished by Samsung, which brought more innovative technologies to the medium and budget niche.  Here you can argue about the technological solutions of the Galaxy S-series with apple smarts, but the essence is still in the combination of technology and price policy with the primacy of the first. <br><br>  As we see at each stage, the leader was replaced because of his self-confidence and the lack of innovation needed by people.  Let not all, but a significant part.  What does Motorola have to do with it?  Yes, very simple.  Google phones should be the quintessence of this process.  Hegemones have always tried to make a device that fits all (and Nokia and Blackberry did flagship-versatile, and even more so Apple, and to a certain measure Samsung). <br><br>  But the idea that it is better to do so much differently confirms itself steadily.  And the one who took it on board - won.  Iphone realized this by making its stores with a bunch of different cases and plushies, Samsung with a wide line, Nokia first with different types and form factors of devices, and now with panels, sizes, camera phones and a price segment. <br><br><h5>  Conclusion </h5><br><br>  Motorola brings this process to almost the end point.  Market segmentation is replaced by its complete individualization.  What is absolutely logical in the light of the post-industrial economy and the increasing role of small enterprises, the crowding out of multi-serial goods and large deliveries of repetitive products such that they have a lot of modifications. <br><br>  Previously, profits were squeezed out by selling you what they wanted.  And this is what you wanted, plus a few more chips that you don't need.  That may still be useless and expensive. <br><br>  Now you will only pay for what you need, and you should not take more.  Now, high-tech has become really affordable, and not closed by the flagship models and the premium segment. <br><br>  The only question is how Moto X will be able to use absolutely the right strategy.  Complete freedom in the development and customization of the operating system, the right choice of materials, the availability of hardware and technology - all that is needed for the implementation of this idea.  The problem is only in the most practical implementation. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/186366/">https://habr.com/ru/post/186366/</a></p>
