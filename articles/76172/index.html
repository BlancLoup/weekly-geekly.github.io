  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Nokia Ovi Services - Squeaky Doors to a Bright Mobile Future</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I‚Äôm not too close to Carroll‚Äôs work, but the quotation very accurately reflects what is happening now with the actively advertised Nokia Ovi services. <br><blockquote>  <em>Alice opened the door and found that she was leading into a small corridor, no more than a rat hole.</em>  <em>She knelt down and saw at the end his most beautiful garden imaginable.</em>  <em>How did she want to get out of the darkened hall and wander among these beds of bright colors, among these cool fountains!</em>  <em>But she couldn't even squeeze her head through the doorway.</em> <br><br>  <em>(L. Carroll)</em> </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/693/fc6/eaa/693fc6eaa91acea9def1beb8bae96ee1.jpg"><br>  They seem to offer us excellent services that help simplify the manipulation of mobile content, and according to the authors, they generally make life better and bring it to a new level.  Yes, the colorful video on TV, and billboards on the streets tell exactly about this, but, as always, the reality is not as perfect as we would like: the garden here is very close - but it is difficult to reach it. <a name="habracut"></a>  And to get up there in full growth, you have to wait until Nokia finally expands the manhole and opens the doors of Ovi wider ... No, I don‚Äôt want to say that the Finnish services are no good.  They are now quite possible to use, but in order to become truly massive, they need to conquer the numerous childhood diseases brought on at the design stage. <br>  As already mentioned, Ovi - a whole set of network services that are available from both mobile phones and computers.  And Nokia phones are sort of guides or, to continue the analogy, small doors leading to eight rooms ‚Äî Files, Calendar, Contacts, Maps, Store, Mail, Share, Music and N-Gage ‚Äî which you can find at ovi .ru or ovi.com. <br><h2>  Files </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/153/df3/41f/153df341fccacc6c4a0de47ae6b34d81.jpg"><br>  This service is primarily intended to access computer files (or several) from a mobile phone.  Although if you want to get into the file system of Big Brother you can generally from any device that has access to the network and a simple browser. <br>  In order for everything to work on the PC, of ‚Äã‚Äãcourse, you need to install a special software.  You should not worry, because this procedure takes only a couple of minutes, after which, without any additional settings, the entire contents of the hard disk becomes accessible from the Web.  Of course, if you are registered with Ovi, remember the username and password, and the desired PC is connected to the network and is currently running.  Very cool stuff!  I installed it and safely forgot it as unnecessary, but at the right moment it helped me: I left the flash drive at home, called my family, asked to plug it into the computer port, and voila - I already watch its contents from the working machine. <br>  In addition, this service provides the user with 10 GB for storing copies of specially up-to-date files online.  In order to locate the desired file on the Web, in the context menu, select "Add to files with permanent access."  After that, theoretically, even if the computer is not connected to the Internet at the right time, it will still be ‚Äúvisible‚Äù in the list, only marked with the ‚ÄúOffline Mode‚Äù marker, and files with permanent access can be found inside.  It would also be very convenient if it worked :) But while you press, do not press the buttons, you will not see the general access ... If you finish, there will be great fellows! <br><h2>  Salendar </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/48f/59a/620/48f59a620380a6a38e5fdb5deebd9314.jpg"><br>  Upon closer inspection, the Calendar turns out to be similar to any of its other counterparts and distinguishes it, probably, only that the contents of the online organizer can be synchronized with the calendar in the Nokia mobile phone.  This is done in a few clicks on the navigation button, and everything is synchronized at once: contacts, notes, and scheduled events.  After some time (depending on the connection speed - data flows for about a minute via EDGE, a couple of seconds via Wi-Fi) everything that was entered into the Calendar from a mobile phone appears at <a href="http://www.ovi.com/services/events">www.ovi.com/services/events</a> , and all events , hammered through a web form, appear in the mobile phone. <br><h2>  Contacts </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cae/959/d70/cae959d70c67e10df871d559489fcc91.jpg"><br>  ‚ÄúWhy fool with connecting the phone to a computer?  ‚ÄúWe thought about Nokia, because contacts can also be stored on a remote server, especially since the synchronization‚Äú through the air ‚Äùis almost faster than using PC Suit!‚Äù <br>  On the Ovi website, this section is presented in the form of an address book, which can be divided into groups for convenience.  However, groups created on the phone for some mysterious reasons do not want to be displayed in the service, and those created using Ovi Contacts are not detected on the phone after synchronization.  In addition, I still could not find the answer, why on the main page only contacts in Cyrillic are shown, and those in Latin can only be found by selecting the appropriate letter in the table of contents. <br><h2>  Maps </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/659/30d/1c5/65930d1c5898f81661841a817458ccbe.jpg"><br>  Maps are definitely good.  Cool, when they are free, and when you can make a route on your computer, and then synchronize it with the same application in your device or mobile phone.  But there is one ‚Äúbut‚Äù - in the world there are already far from one and not two services, in the shadow of which to grow with new mapping services is quite difficult.  And in order for a new player to be noticed on the market and start using its services, it is necessary that there be a trump card in his sleeve.  Nokia seems to have such a trump card, and it is called detailing.  Yes, on the face of it, Google‚Äôs maps turned out to be more convenient, with a bunch of different nice features, and our Yandex is not far behind him (some fentiflyushechki will even have better ones), but neither one nor the other has a driveway!  And courtyards are almost the most important thing, because normal people would like to make a route not to the street, and not to the house entirely, but to a specific entrance.  In general, for the Nokia detailing, a huge five with a plus, but for the convenience and speed of work, so far only a trio. <br><h2>  Store </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/814/b7f/b67/814b7fb67a3566116473debc6c5c80a3.jpg"><br>  This year, following the example of Apple and their App Store, all the mobile phone manufacturers decided to acquire their own app store.  Google watched and watched and decided that Android also needed something like that, and embedded the Market application in it, by running which the user can easily find the program he needs and download right there, if necessary by paying with a credit card.  Microsoft also did not sit on their hands and recently rolled out, albeit not convenient yet, but their own Marketplace. <br>  And since the point here is not even in fashion at all, but in the fact that such an approach to the distribution of content is really convenient, Nokia could not help but offer its own version of a mobile application store.  Going to store.ovi.com, you will see the content divided into several categories (recommended, applications, games, audio and video, personalized), as well as the search bar.  Content, we have to admit, is not very much, but according to knowledgeable people, about 200 new programs are added weekly ‚Äî not so much free. <br>  For example, take the paid Gravity - a well-known Twitter client - worth 9.99 euros.  You cannot download an application to a computer ‚Äî you must first send a message to your phone with a link to download, and there you can click the Buy button.  So it is easier to go directly to the store from a mobile phone, so as not to waste time in vain, especially since the mobile version of the service looks much more convenient - there are no unnecessary details.  So, to buy a program, you need to enter your credit card number, and in between times enter your registration information several times, because the Ovi Store is very suspicious, and asks for a login with a password almost after every small operation.  It seems to be not scary, but it is enough to download several games or programs, as it will already begin to annoy. <br>  And with free software, everything is simple: you will need to enter your login and password just once, and no one asks about the credit card :) Click Download, and the program is installed.  Beauty. <br><h2>  Mail </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/af5/009/3e1/af50093e1233ac803932a9cf88e54f7c.jpg"><br>  One might think that almost no one can do without e-mail today: nobody is asked, everyone has one.  But it only seems that way!  There are a lot of people in the world who do not have it, or they want another one, and this is exactly what Nokia is counting on. <br>  Ovi Mail is another phone-oriented service from a famous Finnish company.  The registered user is provided with a free gigabyte of disk space, as well as all the attributes of normal mail: built-in antispam, address book (which, by the way, does not overlap with the ‚ÄúContacts‚Äù service, although it is clearly suggested) and other mandatory things like support for POP3 and IMAP protocols.  And as a bonus, there is a special ‚Äúmobile‚Äù chip - the ability to choose one of two modes of operation depending on the data transfer rate, that is, for wide and narrow channels.  For those who are deprived of high-speed Internet, Nokia thought up to disable all the decorations: pictures, beautiful buttons, etc. However, turn off - do not disconnect, it‚Äôs still inconvenient to work with the web interface of this mail on a small mobile phone screen.  The question is why there was a garden, if most likely the user decides to set up an email client on his machine?  Unclear.  And in general, it is also necessary to refine. <br><h2>  Share </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bd2/387/eb9/bd2387eb93068239f659a79a978e0329.jpg"><br>  Nokia didn‚Äôt go past the fashionable trend of socialization.  To quickly show your friends a photo or video, just ‚Äúshare‚Äù the desired file by sending it to the Ovi Share server, preliminarily meaningfully naming and tagging for convenience.  After that, everyone who is in the know will be able to visit the page of the form share.ovi.com/users/username and see what happened to you recently.  In principle, comfortable and everything works well, but something is missing.  For example, along with Ovi Share, Nokia devices also support the more advanced functionally Flickr service.  The photos sent there can be shown in a blog in two clicks, and a link can be left on Twitter, but the native Exchange (honestly, the dubious translation of the word share) is closed to itself, and this does not bring him popularity. <br><h2>  Music </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/19c/cb7/78c/19ccb778c80cf3e8485cb0e9d1ffe743.jpg"><br>  Unfortunately, I can‚Äôt say anything about the Nokia music store, as it‚Äôs just not there in Russia yet.  When it will be?  They say that soon, but they say for a long time, so ... :) <br><h2>  N-gage </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/142/023/6b3/1420236b3151d239a07492f321dfdf92.jpg"><br>  And for dessert, Nokia has long been the well-known gaming social network N-Gage, which at the moment, perhaps thought out much better than all the other services, united under the common name Ovi.  And not to stand out, "Engeyd" will soon change the name to a more concise and understandable at a glance Games.  But the essence of it will not change: we register, specify the phone model, download or buy the games recommended for it, collect points, measure with them. <br>  The funny thing is that N-Gage, although it is part of Ovi, still stands alone: ‚Äã‚Äãyou can go there from the main Ovi panel, but you‚Äôll have to re-enter the address again, because there is no special link.  Yes, and you need to register separately. <br><h2>  IMHO </h2><br>  In my opinion, early Nokia took up advertising for this whole set of services.  Somehow it is damp for the time being, and it seems that the common name Ovi was all quite random and independent of each other.  It would be possible to promote some of them separately, but the chip seems to be quite different: ‚ÄúDownload, send, communicate, play, listen, search, travel with Nokia Ovi!‚Äù That is, it means that they all somehow are connected, but in fact it turns out that, going into each section, you need to re-enter the password, and the interpenetration of services is practically none.  In general, sadly somehow.  Only N-Gage is really happy, but it has been developing for a long time and still lives on its own.  And still promising Ovi Files and Maps, but they need to bring to mind, as in general, and other services.  However, knowing Nokia, it must be assumed that in the end everything will lead to divine appearance, and they will finally be able to open the doors to a brighter future, where the grass will be greener, the trees will be higher, and mobile phones will order pizza themselves when we get hungry.  The only question is when? <br>  <em>¬© Zvyagin Ivan, for <a href="http://cyberstyle.ru/">CyberStyle.ru</a> and Habrahabr.</em> <br><br>  PSOvi, by the way, is translated from Finnish as ‚Äúdoor‚Äù. </div>
