    <h1>  <font color="#3b5998">About turns of fate</font> </h1><br>  <b>Pasha, in the previous program, Alexander Belov was our guest, and his story is interesting because he graduated from the Faculty of Oceanology and then somehow came to the field of information technology.</b>  <b>What is your story?</b>  <b>How did you get into IT?</b> <br><br>  Everything is simple enough for me: I got a higher education on the specialization of the ACS, in the IT industry, but I had different options.  That is, I considered both information technologies and alternative, and absolutely opposite areas - for example, law.  I loved history very much and, moreover, I even entered the Academy of Law and literally, by the will of fate, I did not become a prosecutor.  Therefore, you see, there can always be turning points in life, but I do not regret now how everything turned out. <br><br>  <b>That is, you deliberately chose IT.</b>  <b>And what made you choose in favor of information technology and give up the right?</b> <br><br>  You know, at such a young age, a conscious decision to make was difficult, but there were some small factors that worked.  For example, one of them is that I really loved math, computer science, participated in olympiads, won, and this despite the fact that I acquired my personal computer already in my third year at the institute. <br><br>  That is, in principle, it does not matter what tools you have, it is important who you are and how you develop.  At some point I even had to find a computer in laboratories, with friends, and so on.  It is clear that everyone in the first year has tasks and they must somehow be carried out. <br><br><blockquote><h4>  <font color="#7891a5"><i>‚ÄúIT IS NOT IMPORTANT WITH WHICH INSTRUMENTS YOU ARE LOST, IMPORTANT WHO YOU ARE AND HOW YOU DEVELOP‚Äù</i></font> </h4></blockquote><br><br><h1>  <font color="#3b5998">About research</font> </h1><br>  <b>We can say that you are to some extent a researcher.</b> <br><br>  Yes.  I am a researcher, and even the very style of our organization proves it.  But I honestly do not know the root cause of the fact that I am a researcher, because I was born in a family of hereditary aircraft manufacturers, and if it were not for the difficult time in which I grew up, I would have remained in this industry.  And, most likely, my parents gave me a craving for research and inventions, and I tried to do what others did not do or solve a problem in a way that they did not solve in a textbook.  This has been traced throughout life and I am very glad that now I can be realized in this direction. <br><br>  <b>Do you remember that it was one of the first tasks that you didn‚Äôt decide in the way that others had expected?</b> <br><br>  Such an example was still in school.  The textbook contains several options for proving theorems on geometry, and I tried to prove it by my own methods, that is, I looked for logic in evidence, and did not use the solutions from the textbook.  And, by the way, in life it helps and restrains, because teachers do not always like students, who are not a bit different in format ... <br><br>  <b>... White crows?</b> <br><br>  No, not even that, but those who reinvent the wheel.  You're kind of an inventor, but the downside is that you're not like everyone else.  And in life it played a negative role: gold medals and some awards bypassed me because of this kind of solution to any problems.  This is traced in the institute.  But among the masses of teachers there are those who give you wings, who see talent in you, and this gives impetus to development. <br><br><blockquote><h4>  <font color="#7891a5"><i>‚ÄúTEACHERS ARE NOT ALWAYS LIKE‚Äú WHITE CROWS ‚Äù‚Äù</i></font> </h4></blockquote><br><br><h1>  <font color="#3b5998">About the first job</font> </h1><br>  <b>So, you graduated from college, and what was the first job, and what task did you set for yourself?</b>  <b>You said - here is your job description, please work?</b> <br><br>  I started working from the first year of the institute, despite the fact that I studied full-time.  And the funny thing is that my first job was in the field of journalism.  I worked as a youth newspaper correspondent for more than a year, my friends and I wrote articles, events were held, and this experience was useful.  The first job in the specialty was a job as a programmer in the transport company Sovtransavto, I was then studying in the third year ... <br><br>  I wrote an information system.  Looking ahead, I will say that later I returned to this company, but already as the CIO of the Moscow office.  It turned out that the program I developed in Smolensk was recognized as one of the best, I was found and offered this position, in which I worked for a year and a half, having been not only from the supplier, but also from the customer, I looked at the IT world on the other hand. <br><br><br><h1>  <font color="#3b5998">From Softpoint to ... Softpoint</font> </h1><br>  <b>What was the turning point that led to the transition from a customer to a supplier?</b> <br><br>  If you look at the chronology of my work, it turns out that I just worked as a programmer, then I moved to SoftPoint, then left SoftPoint, worked as an IT director, and returned as Technical Director SoftPoint.  It turns out that in the work book of my main works, these are two works, where I systematically rose at the expense of certain successes.  I like to create more than to serve, because, after all, the customer cannot develop creatively, everything should be systematic and your department should be serving. <br><br>  <b>You're at the customer within certain limits.</b> <br><br>  Yes.  You are a servicing element of a large business, and in the current situation it is convenient that you are this business.  I understand your price and role. <br><br>  <b>What was SoftPoint at the time when you got there?</b> <br><br><br><h1>  <font color="#3b5998">‚ÄúSoftpoint was a room of 10 square meters‚Äù</font> </h1><br>  SoftPoint was a room with a size of 10 square meters and 3 like-minded people who were just starting a business, that is, there were a lot of ambitious ideas, but I would not say that these ideas were about the technologies that we developed at the moment, because human thought also evolving. <br><br>  From that platform, we thought it would be completely different and could not expect that we would be able to develop such large infrastructure solutions.  It was unattainable - to fight with such large corporations as Microsoft, IBM ... This feeling, when a startup is just beginning and you are not sure of anything, you need to go through. <br><br>  <b>Well, Google, too, once started with a room, and now it is one of the largest Internet giants.</b>  <b>As I was preparing for this interview, I looked at your site and saw that there are actually two sites - SoftPoint.ru and SoftPointplus.ru.</b>  <b>Why two sites, what is the difference between them?</b> <br><br>  SoftPoint.ru is a corporate website that presents our main decisions, information about our company's policy, development vector, strategy, there are various partner information, and SoftPointplus.ru is the company's blog. <br><br>  In order not to mix our research and development on the main site, we specifically developed a separate news feed so that people could be enlightened and enter into discussions using a blog.  There is a certain corporate style and corporate standard, and there is a certain news blog that will just describe our solutions and technologies, because often we have a lot of developments that will never be translated into solutions, and we understand this.  Developments are interesting to masses of people and masses of specialists, but at the same time we cannot publish them on the corporate website. <br><br>  <b>From transfer to transfer, we have a question about domain names.</b>  <b>Why SoftPointplus, and not, for example, Blog.SoftPoint.ru?</b>  <b>Why is it not a third-level domain in relation to your main domain, but a separate domain name?</b> <br><br>  Our company has a lot of solutions, scientific research, 50% of the company's resources work according to standard R &amp; D (research work) and, naturally, these works have a certain result.  They are always valuable, even in case of failure.  Therefore, we decided to publish this information on a different domain and it is a kind of application, that is, plusSoftPoint is valuable information for specialists.  Specialists have the opportunity to even see what developments have been made at all, perhaps they will adopt this information and already push off not from the initial point of view, but will be able to continue research. <br><br><br><h1>  <font color="#3b5998">About the Softpoint blog audience</font> </h1><br>  <b>In fact, you have separated the commercial part from the research part.</b>  <b>And who is the main audience of your blog?</b> <br><br>  There was no full-fledged research here, but I can assume that these are people who, first, are interested in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãperformance optimization, and this area is becoming more and more important, and this, even from accountants, is yes, and there is information for them , the information concerns the fact that there are some solutions that will help them in their work, and ending with IT directors. <br><br>  When you understand that the level of maturity of an IT company and the level of scientific research are quite large, you trust it, because there are no solutions that are degenerate from practical case study.  We try to show that solutions flowed out of research work. <br><br>  <b>Then the question arises.</b>  <b>But have you ever thought about broadcasting this blog to the Infostar portal, after all Infoostart‚Äôs audience is really very diverse, ranging from accountants to technical directors, IT directors and even general directors.</b> <br><br>  I have a profile on Infostart, there are several quite interesting articles about our research, moreover, these articles are not in the blog.  That is, Infostart is considered by us as one of the sites for placing such information.  It‚Äôs just that the studies are not always related to 1C, they are not always even indirectly somehow mated, but we are interested in placing everything connected with 1C on the Infostart site, we did and will continue to do. <br><br>  <b>We heard that SoftPoint was from the very beginning.</b>  <b>By the way, what years were these, how old are you today?</b> <br><br>  We are the eleventh year, 2004 is the SoftPoint year of formation, it was a typical start-up, just at that time a number of large Russian companies finally grew to the level when they were seriously faced with performance problems on Microsoft's seickle servers, and it was time when these decisions began to emerge.  Because until that time, performance problems were solved by buying more powerful hardware. <br><br>  <b>More iron, more memory, more processors.</b> <br><br>  Rather, I would say, the processor frequency increased, that is, it was first X-86, then Pentium, and so on.  And at each turn the number of transistors increased, the processor frequency increased.  This means that the speed of that server and the program running on the server grew linearly.  But at some point we reached the ceiling of the processor frequency.  And they went multi-core systems. <br><br>  I personally associate just such a start for the company with the fact that multi-core systems have gone and it was already impossible to just - and now it‚Äôs impossible - to buy some powerful server to correct fundamental problems.  It turns out that the properties of the system should be used as much as possible. <br><br><blockquote><h4>  <font color="#7891a5"><i>"It is impossible to correct the problem of buying a more powerful server"</i></font> </h4></blockquote><br>  <b>Well, in fact, the question arose about the correct and proper parallelization processes.</b> <br><br>  To parallelize the process, the settings are point-like - this is a complex task. <br><br><br><h1>  <font color="#3b5998">About the development of the company</font> </h1><br>  <b>You are 11 years old this year.</b>  <b>You celebrated a decade.</b>  <b>Ten years is, especially for an IT-company, a considerable time, few people live to it, and if they do, they make some significant step forward in relation to what they started from.</b>  <b>What is SoftPoint like now?</b> <br><br>  Now SoftPoint is a very dynamic company, I can say that over the past year, 2014, the level of our development is somewhere between 70-80%. <br><br>  <b>Is it a year?</b>  <b>Every year?</b> <br><br>  This is a year.  We are actively launching an affiliate network, because we ourselves cannot cope with business needs.  That is, we are trying to scale our sales, our business, our loyalty to customers.  Plus, we are technological partners of a number of companies-world leaders.  Among them, just the company Microsoft.  She is our leading strategic partner, we are very active in terms of technology, we complement Microsoft technologies with our solutions.  The principal difference is that: basically, we are creating solutions that are not based on Microsoft technologies, but on solutions that allow us to make add-ins in order to more effectively use Microsoft technologies. <br><br><br><h1>  <font color="#3b5998">About Data Platform</font> </h1><br>  <b>Your site says that you are a partner of the Data Platform, and what does this mean?</b> <br><br>  Data Platform is a sign of the company's competence in data processing and management.  In Russia, there are only fifteen gold partners in the Dat Platform. <br><br>  <b>But what about the whole world?</b>  <b>To understand the relationship ...</b> <br><br>  There are, of course, several hundred of them in the world.  But the most important thing is that of the Russian companies with Data Platform Gold - less than a dozen.  Most of these 10 companies have offices in Russia. <br><br>  <b>Well, that is, fifteen is in fact already the amount, which is calculated not in the tenths of a percent, but in percent.</b>  <b>This, as I understand it, is from 3 to 5 percent.</b> <br><br>  Yes.  And Microsoft is very closely monitoring which companies are seeking this status.  In principle, any company can achieve this, but it should have excellent references for clients - once, then you need to get at least four engineers, and two of them should be competent enough, about 14 exams should be passed to Microsoft. <br><br>  <b>A decent amount.</b> <br><br>  But there is a second option, which is our company.  If a company has solutions worthy of the Gold Data Platform, the development company may not train the necessary number of employees, but achieve the status with its development, which will be recognized by Microsoft testing at a correspondingly high rank.  We are the only company in Russia that has taken this path.  That is, we have certified one of the solutions as a solution corresponding to this high level. <br><br>  <b>Are these solutions positioned only on the domestic market, or are they being exploited abroad?</b> <br><br>  The decisions of our company are created precisely so that there are no restrictions in terms of geography, in terms of industries, implementation and so on.  That is, decisions are positioned mainly on the policies of each particular company.  It can be domestic, it can be foreign.  It is no secret that many companies are now pursuing a policy of centralizing the database, that is, all users are trying to get into one database repository to work together.  This is an advantage for business development.  There are companies that, conversely, decentralize databases.  At the same time they have to serve the exchange.  We focus on these vectors.  That is, we know that we have solutions for the centralization vector - when it is necessary to ensure the performance of a large number of users in a single system.  There are, for example, such exchange solutions that provide online synchronization of databases located in different territorial zones. <br><br>  <b>And how flexible are the settings?</b>  <b>In other words, how much the consumer himself, in the course of work, can make this reconfiguration without your participation?</b> <br><br>  Migrating in terms of centralization? <br><br>  <b>Centralization, for example, on decentralization, and vice versa.</b>  <b>That is, will he need, for example, a complete reinstallation of the entire system, the entire infrastructure, or some significant changes, will he need to invite your specialists for this, or can he, having trained one or two employees, do it himself?</b> <br><br>  Usually, the customer himself naturally makes the decision on the transition to centralization or decentralization.  It is important that since we have a range of solutions from two areas, we do not interfere in its specific solution, that is, we are there and there we help.  And at the same time we can objectively assess which option is acceptable for him.  Therefore, the efforts that he spends to change the architecture, do not even relate to our solutions, we will then simply provide this architecture - that is, the transition itself, it is assumed, he can do with his own efforts. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/224/2e9/40c/2242e940c13c455a91ff6c79b97457fa.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><br><br><h1>  <font color="#3b5998">About the development process</font> </h1><br>  <b>Earlier we talked about the fact that you have a commercial component and there is a scientific component, which, in fact, follows the scheme of classical research.</b>  <b>And how is the development process in the company?</b>  <b>Development, research, new discoveries.</b> <br><br>  We have a core in terms of development, there are employees who are the intellectual property of our company.  And teams are working on various projects, not more than five people.  This is a metric that is selected for optimal technology movement.  Previously, we had teams and 12 people each, there were teams of 2-3 people each, and we developed this universal form for ourselves, when there is a team, there is a team leader, there are selected programmers and various analysts, and these teams are the driving force for developing these solutions .  Each team has a number of solutions, where the development is carried out.  And the invention itself is in general a subtle matter, because, I must admit that even with all the desire, not all people are able to do it.  Not everyone is able to look a few steps forward, see an advantage that we don‚Äôt even dream about.  And here, in our company, there are not many such people, but there are few of them in other companies.  There are very strong developers who provide us with unique technologies, but these are system developers basically, all this is the level of writing drivers. <br><br>  <b>Well, that is, those that form a basis, a kind of substrate for all other solutions.</b> <br><br>  Yes. <br><br>  <b>Do I understand correctly that teams are essentially project-based, that is, if we say that there are some unique specialists, then they are ‚Äúported‚Äù from project to project.</b> <br><br>  Not.  I would say that there are project teams for the implementation of services to the client, then this is really some kind of temporary team that gathers employees from different directions so that the project is delivered on time and efficiently.  And in terms of the development of the team is usually well-established, and employees can communicate as efficiently as possible, and interact within the framework of this team.  She does not crumble. <br><br>  <b>And how and by what principle were these teams formed?</b>  <b>After all, IT specialists are a separate category of specialists for whom the comfort of interacting with each other is very important, because each of us is a specialist and each of us is different in our own way.</b>  <b>How did you go through this stage?</b> <br><br><br><h1>  <font color="#3b5998">‚ÄúIT-specialist is a kind of artist, creator‚Äù</font> </h1><br>  I agree with you that an IT specialist is a kind of artist, a creator, that is, he can create something that did not exist before him, some element did not work before him, earned it after him.  Here I can say that the teams evolved evolutionary.  That is, there are no teams in the market that can be recruited through recruitment agencies. <br><br>  <b>... So this is a certain set of circumstances?</b> <br><br>  Exactly.  Plus, here it is also very important that in teams, as you rightly said, there must be communication, all players must be commanding.  If there is a ‚Äústar,‚Äù that is, a person with unique knowledge, but he will not have command, ‚Äúwe have met such people,‚Äù then, of course, he will not take root. <br><br>  The paradox is that he lacks knowledge alone, but he cannot interact to create a synergistic effect with other specialists.  These are some kind of ‚Äúdo-it-yourself‚Äù who like to work autonomously, there are tasks on the market for such people, but they are not for large-scale development.  That is, the product should be as reliable and stable as possible.  Therefore, communication and potential are more important for us than his current skills.  Current skills can be gained.  It is important that there are two first criteria. <br><br>  <b>As far as I know, at the moment you have patented solutions in the field of horizontal scaling, data depersonalization and full-fledged replication, briefly tell about these solutions and what products they are.</b> <br><br>  Yes of course.  As I said, products do not appear immediately, we just fill the needs of the business, if we see a white spot in some kind of technology.  Business understands efficiency, is ready for implementation, but no one does it.  Because it is difficult, unprofitable at the first stage, and so on.  And this is a kind of prerequisite to develop. <br><br>  In particular, the technology of horizontal scaling Data-cluster - we developed this technology in 2007, when there was not always-on, in order to synchronize the nodes of the cluster, but was just lock-shipping. <br><br>  <b>In my opinion, in 2012 only the version appeared.</b> <br><br>  Yes.  And here it turns out, there was a decision on the market, but there was no demand for it, because the company's first circumstances did not grow to that.  And the second - the fact that lock-pinning was imperfect.  It was a technology rather heavy to maintain.  And it turns out that when in 2012 a new version came out and this unique technology appeared, which, by the way, put the Seekle server on a par with ORACLE and so on according to its capabilities.  This technology is clearly not enough, and we had ready-made solutions.  We have raised this world in the market, adapted it to always, and after two months have already conducted testing with Thunder. <br><br>  <b>In fact, your proactivity has fired 100% ...</b> <br><br>  Yes.  All that research does not pass, they never pass in vain.  You still have an edge over your competitors.  Further replication of solutions is also a unique situation when there are a number of technologies on the market, but at the same time they are imperfect in some aspects: in terms of performance, in terms of ease of setup, in terms of ease of maintenance.  Incidentally, this is a very important point - with the current service situation, because it costs the most.  And we took, and, given these circumstances, we developed a technology that would have the best performance.  That is, they took the best from one, the best from the other, the best existing from the third, and got rid of the mistakes that they had. <br><br><br><h1>  <font color="#3b5998">On the publicity of the company</font> </h1><br>  <b>Good.</b>  <b>Suppose I am a potential customer.</b>  <b>Where can I meet your company and get information about it except on sites?</b>  <b>How public is your company?</b> <br><br>  The company is fully public.  We are open to communicate with the customer, for large customers we hold individual seminars, plus last year about 30 presentations at various events.  These events are the Infostart conference, and some specialized 1C conferences, conferences on Microsoft technologies, including one of the famous ones - DevCon, a conference for developers.  Further, specialized events are held by industry, IT in retail, in energy, and so on. <br><br>  Plus - I will reveal a little secret.  Somewhere 80% of our customers came on word of mouth.  This is the best advertisement that can exist on the market.  There is a pool of satisfied customers with embedded solutions, and they advise business neighbors who to contact.  And therefore reputation in the market is the most expensive thing there is, and reputation helps you move.  20% are all other customers: this is a website, these are events and any other forms. <br><br><blockquote><h4> <font color="#7891a5"><i>¬´  ‚Äî   ¬ª</i></font> </h4></blockquote><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I have a somewhat personal question related to the topic of conferences. What theme do you like to perform with the most?</font></font></b> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Really difficult question. All the technologies I talk about are well known to me. And after some time, telling me about them is not so interesting. I would prefer, most likely, such technological speeches for a round table to gather, we would like to open the curtain of one of the technologies, and indeed - such a technological, technical conversation, to which I would like to draw the maximum number of experts, because I see that the value of this knowledge is very high. Such events I really like. Because marketing is always a little crafty. Here, when technology and experts, you can not hide. </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Here you will not get off with one marketing.</font></font></b> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Exactly. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Experts will immediately open it. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You should be aware of your question.</font></font><br><br><br><h1> <font color="#3b5998"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">About receiving an international award Microsoft</font></font></font> </h1><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Last year, you won the Microsoft International Prize. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And along with such companies as DSP, HP, CSK. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And you can detail about this? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">That is - what is this prize and what does it mean to be the laureate of this prize? </font></font></b> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After testing and a number of implementations, Microsoft offered us to participate in this competition. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The first stage of the competition is the Russian competition of partnership solutions on the Data Platform, that is, those solutions that are somehow connected with the seickle server. </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Do I understand correctly that this is essentially what we talked about a little earlier, that you can certify your decision and at the same time get a partnership in this area?</font></font></b> <br><br>  Not.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is an extra activity. And we did not hope that we could win in the world. Because for the decision-making in Russia are mainly responsible Russian experts. It is clear that in a certain area we were familiar, or they somehow knew about our decisions, therefore there could be some element ... </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">... Subjectivity ...</font></font></b> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> ... And here in the world a delegate from each country votes for a decision. The solution is described in English, cases are described, the principle of this decision is described, and experts from all countries, not knowing where the decision came from, give marks - how much they consider the solution to be qualitative. </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">That is, in essence, the decision is presented anonymously, and the experts do not know about the decision of whose company and from which country?</font></font></b> <br><br>  Yes.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You can say so. The delegates who vote for this decision are not biased, because everyone represents his country, for everyone the victory of his country's decision is an element of prestige. And here, due to the difficult geopolitical situation, it must be admitted, our decision really did reach the final unexpectedly. Of course, when the decision reaches the final, I would like it to win. </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Courage such.</font></font></b> <br><br>  Yes.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There were about 400 decisions in this nomination from all over the world. And the final comes out 3 decisions. </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Please tell me your personal opinion about what it means to be a participant in this prize.</font></font></b> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> We went to Washington for the nomination. And this is an indescribable feeling when an audience of 10,000 IT specialists gathers at the stadium, such, you know, the artist‚Äôs ‚Äúshow-performance‚Äù conference, and the president who personally congratulated those who won, at a business breakfast with everyone. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">By the way, one of the Russian companies won one of the nominations - this is a web-factory, and we were personally congratulated by the president of Microsoft Russia and a number of high-ranking top managers. And this, of course, is pride in the fact that what we are doing is required not only in Russia, in a confined space, but truly global.</font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">That is what you do, you do in the right direction.</font></font></b> <br><br>  Yes.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And most importantly - it gives strength, inspires, and then you are working as a motor to create a new one, you understand that you can not stop. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Plus, given that our company is constantly developing and not everything goes within the solution, we have to deal with this endlessly - such an endless scientific work, an endless scientific process.</font></font><br><br><br><h1> <font color="#3b5998"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">About customer interaction standards</font></font></font> </h1><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Good. But, given the specifics of the company, taking into account the commercial component and the R &amp; D component, given the number of clients that you have, you cannot work without any standards of interaction with customers. Can you elaborate on these standards?</font></font></b> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> First of all, the majority of clients are clients with whom we are not even familiar, all over Russia and the CIS, that is, we are familiar only in absentia by phone or by means of modern communication - Skype and others.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Second: in order for us to conduct work, we have specially developed a toolkit, which is our eyes and ears in a certain information environment of the customer. Thus, we have a debugged technological map of project management. That is, we send some monitoring - performance monitoring, we get information about what is really happening at the client, thereby eliminating human errors - that is, the usual standard approach is questioning, questions, and so on. It is easier from a technological point of view to get this information in the machine. This will be the most reliable information. </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I understand that your decision. And the idea itself - was it originally yours or did you take and modify some other idea?</font></font></b> <br><br>  Not.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The main idea was ours, moreover, it did not initially translate even into a commercial product, this toolkit. </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So this is, in fact, an auxiliary tool for managing the main project, does it turn out?</font></font></b> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> To provide those steps that will lead to quality improvement. That is, you take and put an instrument of objective control, and you modify it when you need to get deeper information about the system. And at some point we realized that this tool - it allows customers, even without our participation, to find pitfalls, bottlenecks and problem points, while only need to train. That is, naturally, when there is a lot of data, training plays a big role.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And it turns out that he grew from our local tool into a commercial product, where in most cases the client simply rents or buys and trains his employees. That is, it conducts training not on courses, but on real data, seeing its own problems, moreover, it sees it 24x7 - monitoring works, - and without load on the current system. </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And where is the guarantee that after setting this in person, the whole thing will not fall later? A demo stand is a demo stand. Here you can do anything and anywhere, but on live data is another matter.</font></font></b> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We monitor the quality of the product, that is, the product is stable and absolutely separated from the working system. His fall should not lead to the loss of efficiency of the current information system. But at the same time, the performance monitoring itself measures its load, measures itself. </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">That is, it is a kind of service that measures third-party services, but on the other hand, it is a service that measures itself as a service.</font></font></b> <br><br>  Yes.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And the most important thing in our work is not to mislead the client and not to deceive ourselves. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is a very valuable statement, which is not only for our area of ‚Äã‚Äãproductivity, but also for anyone - automation, business planning, and so on. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It so happens that in the life routine you make such miscalculations that you yourself, believing in what you are doing, do not check, step on the rake and get the wrong result. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And this is the worst of all, because from the point of view of loyalty to the client, this is the loss of the client.</font></font><br><br><blockquote><h4> <font color="#7891a5"><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúDO NOT DELETE THE CUSTOMER AND DON'T FRAUD YOURSELF‚Äù</font></font></i></font> </h4></blockquote><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Well, yes, and especially considering the word of mouth. </font></font></b> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Exactly. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Moreover, in the Internet age, one, two, three miscalculations can hit a very round sum for the company, then it is necessary to rehabilitate. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Everyone knows, mostly we write negative on the Internet more often than positive, and here we need to collect an order of magnitude more positive to really correct the situation.</font></font><br><br><br><h1> <font color="#3b5998"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">About professional conferences</font></font></font> </h1><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Your company was a participant in Infostart conferences. Are there any significant differences between InfoCart conferences and conferences of the same Microsoft or other IT companies, or specialized IT conferences?</font></font></b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e99/0f4/716/e990f47169d14ef988c196f7b6014c28.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> There is, of course. As an independent expert, I can say that at the Infostart conference there is a very friendly atmosphere - an environment that is rarely organized here at such official events. For the most part, official events are of a formal nature: there are speakers, there are clients, there are partners of these clients, and this, it turns out, is some kind of policy.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And Infostart is an open platform, where informal communication smooths this officiality. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">On Infostarte they are more sincere towards the organization, it is felt. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And that's why he likes it, that's why there is an audience of 600 people ‚Äî rarely when you attend a conference, much less paid, you can gather so many people. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Just like the setting itself. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In terms of reports, not all topics may be interesting to me, of course, and this is normal. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Everyone comes to the conference for themselves. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Some come to listen, others - to eat and relax, others - something else. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Everyone chooses for themselves the direction.</font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d00/834/145/d00834145e964d58b6b819569a0dbe18.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><br><br><h1> <font color="#3b5998"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">About the pleasure of work</font></font></font> </h1><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In conclusion, I would like to ask a few personal questions. You said that work brings you pleasure. And what exactly helps to get these positive emotions?</font></font></b> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> The solution of a complex problem. </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The invention of the bike?</font></font></b> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Bicycle generally can not be invented)) This is the wrong policy. I am pleased when the customer, a representative of the largest company in Russia, sends a letter saying that ‚Äúwe didn‚Äôt ask you for help, thank you, you showed real professionalism,‚Äù and there were many such letters.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Prior to this, no one in the country could solve the problem of companies when the business stops, because some elements stopped working, and since the structure is huge, we need a system analysis to understand where that bottleneck is. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And no one could, and we could and received such gratitude. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Winning is pleasant, and let it be a small victory, but it is a great pleasure. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And plus you solve the problem with the help of the same technologies, because they are at your fingertips.</font></font><br><br><br><h1> <font color="#3b5998"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">On the development of technology depersonalization</font></font></font> </h1><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And what promising technologies that can shoot in the future, are you developing now?</font></font></b> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> That's how this year appeared technology for depersonalization. We have already patented it. It is connected with the fact that with minimal effort it is possible to store personal information in secure data centers in Russia. </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Is this what concerns the 152-FZ?</font></font></b> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is a law that will come into force in September, it should have come into force from January 2015, everything is postponed. And it is postponed because there are not many solutions to this issue on the market. We took an ambitious task: to create a technology that would implement it at the technological level. This means that you have a database, you have personal information in database structures, and you could split it into two components without altering the applications that the database uses: into an impersonal database in the clouds or anywhere, and personal information in any data center that is certified and protected.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And it turns out that the task itself, we do not consider as narrowly as the law. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The law in other countries is approximately the same. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Both in Germany and in other countries, countries are tightening personal information due to geopolitics in order to store personal data with us. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And here we are looking for solutions to the global market, and the solution will be applicable for other tasks. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Or, for example, the inverse problem. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There is a state law, and there are business requirements. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Business wants to defend itself ... </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What is called a commercial secret?</font></font></b> <br><br>  Yes.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Or, for example, he wants to protect himself from competitors - splitting the data, having received one of the impersonal data arrays, the competitor will not be able to use it. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">That is, the semantics of this data, integrity, accuracy are sharply reduced.</font></font><br><br><br><h1> <font color="#3b5998"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">About future plans</font></font></font> </h1><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And, probably, the last question - what are your future plans: personal and companies in general?</font></font></b> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> We are going to enter the international market this year, we are actively working on the redesign and description of our technologies. We are in this really in the past years have fallen short. The technologies were unique, but in order to properly position products and tools on the market, a beautiful wrapper is required. We are actively working on this.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Next, we are developing a number of new technologies for depersonalization and the creation of hybrid databases. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This means that we will create a kind of core that will interact with both relational databases and non-relational sources: these are Big data and other things. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Moreover, our principle will still work. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We proceed from the assumption that the technology will allow to ensure this synchronization without software development. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Due to some intermediate layer in the form of our technologies. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Well, I see myself most likely with my elbows rolled up in terms of creation. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I'm interested.</font></font><br><br><blockquote><h4> <font color="#7891a5"><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúTO POSITION THE PRODUCTS AND TOOLS IN THE MARKET, IT IS NECESSARY TO NEED A BEAUTIFUL WRAP‚Äù</font></font></i></font> </h4></blockquote><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Have you found your niche?</font></font></b> <br><br>  Yes.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">These are technological issues. "As long as we burn with freedom, while hearts for honor are alive." As long as there is strength and energy, I think it is necessary to use them where it gives the maximum effect. Therefore, in this direction I will develop. </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">By tradition, each guest gives our viewers some tips and advice on how to achieve the desired results. What can you advise our viewers, novice developers, young startups?</font></font></b> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Dear startupers))) Based on my inner values, I would advise you in life a little more audacity, so that you do not always follow the masses, for a certain opinion, but demolish the templates. It seems to me that the main value of the work is in this direction. Therefore, invent and do not be afraid to make a mistake, mistakes will find you themselves, but successes and achievements too. </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Pavel, thank you for the conversation.
