And most importantly, it corresponds to the motto - do it yourself! <br>  The most active people and money will be able to earn in its implementation. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  As you know, girls are different.  Some people like gifts made by hands - by the hands of a jeweler, others are indifferent to a gift ... the main thing is to have an automatic transmission. <br>  What unites girls is that they love flowers! <br>  Here we are talking about flowers. <br><br>  There is such a belief - the life span of a bouquet directly depends on the strength of the giver‚Äôs love.  Therefore, everyone wants a bouquet of long days of life. <br>  Of course the best way is to increase the power of love!  But if it is not enough, then you can use various useful tips: <br>  - cut flowers before or after sunset; <br>  - do not mix different varieties in the bouquet; <br>  - make a cut with a sharp knife under water; <br>  - Cover the flowers with a thin film; <br>  - cut off extra leaves; <br>  - spray the bouquet with water; <br>  - put a bouquet in a vase; <br>  - pour water into the vase; <br>  - add sugar, citric acid or aspirin to the water.

      If you carefully consider these tips, you can draw very simple conclusions: <br>  - flowers need water; <br>  - water must be of high quality; <br>  - Flowers get along badly with others. <br>  Just like people! <br><br>  When the plant is not cut, the roots collect and pump water through the stem. <br>  After cutting the flower loses the pump, water and life. <br>  The solution to the problem is to find a replacement for the roots using an external pump. <br><br>  I have two options - medical and IT. <br><br>  <b>Medical.</b> <br>  Those who have not yet been in the hospital are happy people who do not know what a ‚Äúsystem‚Äù is. <br>  This is the kind of thing that gives food or medicine through a vein into the bloodstream of the body. <br>  Principle of work: the capacity with solution is located over the lying person.  The pressure of the water column exceeds the pressure in the circulatory system, and the fluid easily enters the body. <br>  The idea is extremely simple - we replace a sick person with a flower: <br>  - insert the stem into the tube (the needle is no longer needed); <br>  - we get rid of air in the system (just dropping the flower down); <br>  - we have a container with water above the flower (having provided the necessary pressure). <br>  To get rid of the feeding process (although it can be made very elegant - everything is limited only by the flight of your imagination), you can create a system like that of a soul-toptun.  The massive construction puts pressure on the flexible container, from which water flows to the stem (one stem - one tube).  The main thing - do not overdo it with pressure, and then take off the flower rocket! <br>  The method is medical, therefore we use as the feed solution the composition described in the last advice on the prolongation of life. <br>  An interesting option: after all, you can not return the flower to its normal position after getting rid of the air ... Then you get the original inverted flower with the auto drinker! <br><br>  Since we are on Habr√©, and not on the flower forum, the <b>IT</b> way is much more interesting. <br>  It is known that water moves in plants through capillaries.  And the capillaries are such thin tubes, similar to those of glass, which are used in experiments. <br>  - If the capillaries are lowered into the liquid with water, then the height of the liquid will be X. <br>  - If you turn on the ultrasound source in the water, then the height of the water rise will be Y. <br>  The most interesting is that Y&gt; X dozens of times! <br>  This is called the ultrasonic capillary effect (abbreviated to UKE). <br>  In the <a href="http://ross-nauka.narod.ru/06/06-109.html">description,</a> pay attention to the royal primula. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D0Pb5GB5-H9s">A spectacular video</a> demonstrating this effect was found on YouTube. <br><br>  Then everything is clear. <br>  IT-bouquet will be a long time to please the bestowed person, and IT specialists will love even more. <br>  There remained a completely ‚Äúsmall‚Äù task: to conduct experiments, select the optimal non-destructive power, frequency, exposure time, develop the ‚ÄúIT-vase‚Äù design, and share the result, because on the nose - March 8! <br><br>  <a href="http://science.compulenta.ru/745500/">News in the subject</a> . <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Drought affected trees emit ultrasound</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><br>  April 16, 2013. <br>  Alexandre Ponomarenko of the University of Grenoble (France) claims that trees under conditions of high stress caused by drought make sounds that can be registered and used as signs of a water deficit dangerous to the plant. <br><br>  Why is this happening?  In a tree trunk, water and a number of substances rise through the network of xylem vessels from the roots to the tops.  Since the trees are high, in order for the delivery of water to work, the pressure in the vessels can be many times greater than the atmospheric pressure.  But, as in the cocktail tube, when the water in the vessel ends and it is no longer enough to fill the entire container, the formation of bubbles may begin.  As a result, when there is a lack of moisture in the xylem, cavitation processes are started, which the tree is almost unable to resist.  And if their scale is too large, the plant will be injured or even die, just like a person in the case of a gas embolism, when air bubbles in the circulatory system cause serious damage to the vessels. <br><br>  To identify cavitation in the tissues of the tree, scientists under the leadership of Mr. Ponomarenko used a piece of pine trunk, placed in a gel, which was designed to simulate the environment inside a living plant.  Then water was gradually removed from the gel, imitating drought conditions.  At the same time, the sample was filmed with a high-speed camera and the sounds coming from it were recorded on the microphone. <br><br>  And so it was possible to find out: the occurrence of bubbles recorded by the camera, and the sounds of cavitation nature coincide in time, and the latter are responsible for 50% of the sounds in the ultrasonic range from the plant.  The remaining half was due to extraneous processes, such as the entry of air bubbles into cells adjacent to xylem vessels. <br><br>  Scientists believe that microphones tuned to such sounds are quite capable of helping to detect drought symptoms in a tree that is still looking healthy, including biocenoses, where such plants are on the verge of extinction due to global droughts that have become more frequent in recent decades. warming <br><br>  Report on the study <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013APS..MARW28001P">presented</a> at the meeting of the American Physical Society <br><br>  Based on <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/04/130415-trees-drought-water-science-global-warming-sounds/">National Geographic</a> . <br></div></div><br>  Or maybe trees produce ultrasound to facilitate the rise of water through the capillaries? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/136869/">https://habr.com/ru/post/136869/</a></p>
