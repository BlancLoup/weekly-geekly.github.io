  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Rating of IT employers in St. Petersburg and Moscow: the results of a survey of developers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Some time ago, the sociological department of St. Petersburg State University decided to figure out which employers are considered the best in IT.  About 2500 people took part in the survey, among them: users of My Circle, visitors to JUG.ru events, subscribers of the Vkontakte and Telegram IT communities.  Today we share the results. <br><br> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/moikrug/blog/342258/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c95/e23/ffb/c95e23ffbe3fe4b20b20b98ef9164eaa.jpg"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><hr><br>  This is what the interviewed audience looks like.  As you can see, technical fraternity prevails - developers, testers and devops (77%) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/649/017/f73/649017f73adb0ecbe444390a7c319a21.png">

    <hr><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9cb/c65/4cb/9cbc654cb4e14ed26a80a4d13f07e5d5.png"><br><br>  In St. Petersburg, JetBrains companies (48% of respondents named this company) and Yandex (35%) were the first to come to the developers.  Next come Vkontakte (13%) and EPAM (12%).  Wrike, Luxoft and Grid Dynamics recalled 6% of respondents. <br><br>  In Moscow, Yandex (67%) and Mail.ru Group (27%) were the first to come to mind.  Then they recall Kaspersky Lab (10%), Google (9%), Avito (7%) and Badoo (5%). <br><br>  The rest of the companies remembered less often: blue highlighted companies that remembered from 2 to 5% of respondents;  and purple - up to 1%. <br><br>  It is curious that in each city the mind of developers is monopolized by literally one or two companies.  All the rest are far behind them by mentioning. <br><br><hr><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/580/93f/204/58093f2047faca58f9d291c80239088f.png"><br><br>  This question is somewhat similar to the previous one.  And indeed, it seems obvious that developers want first of all to work in the same companies that are considered the best in IT in general. <br><br>  But this is true only for the most top companies from the previous question (Yandex, JetBrains, Mail.ru Group, Kaspersky Lab, Vkontakte). <br><br>  Immediately behind them in terms of popularity are not exactly the same companies that the developers noted as the best in IT in general.  For example, in St. Petersburg, Wargaming and Deutsche Bank have bypassed EPAM, Grid Dynamics, Wrike and Luxoft.  In Moscow, SberTech, Parallels and Rambler bypassed Avito, Badoo and Google. <br><br>  Apparently, when a developer evaluates companies not as a whole in the IT industry, but as their personal employer, several other criteria work.  A specific technology stack, office comfort and working conditions are evaluated, personal contacts and more work. <br><br><hr><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dcb/2b5/9d8/dcb2b59d80155c45b23de1553f2c1c64.png"><br><br>  By the number of developers who are aware of the activities of companies, leaders are not very detached from the rest.  At least in each city there are 10 companies that every second developer is well aware of. <br><br>  But awareness does not mean recognition as the best employer.  Sometimes it is quite the opposite, when the company has a negative employer reputation, known to many at the same time. <br><br><hr><br>  Further, each respondent was asked to rate the companies in which they would like to work, according to 12 different criteria.  For each, it was possible to rate from 1 to 7 (the higher, the better). <br><br>  Next, we present data only for the 12 companies with the highest number of evaluations. <br><br>  SberTech, Parallels and Rambler should definitely be on this list.  But the authors of the survey did not include them most likely because Muscovites had less St. Petersburg group in the survey, and in total they gave fewer ratings for the companies named. <br><br>  Still, theoretically, Avito, Badoo and Google could get here, but they were not initially included in the selection list, the respondents manually added them themselves, however, they could not give marks to them anymore. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c61/ac2/f14/c61ac2f14cd7bb6abc74606281933c1f.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5fd/85b/04d/5fd85b04d066ebef74ba3d687583dd39.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d93/7f2/89e/d937f289e71b6d736f3fa78ce9713fa8.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/66b/6d6/1d4/66b6d61d4b8555bb80b07ae21c04c9e1.png"><br><br>  We could split all 12 evaluation criteria into 3 conditional nominations: <br><br>  <b>1. Working conditions and career</b> <br><br><ol><li>  The most flexible work schedule for Grid Dynamics and Wrike </li><li>  Wages above market in Deutsche Bank and JetBrains </li><li>  The coolest office in Yandex and Mail.ru Group </li><li>  Career growth opportunities are slightly more than others at Grid Dynamics and EPAM </li><li>  Most opportunities to move to another country in Grid Dynamics </li></ol><br>  <b>2. Professional development</b> <br><br><ol><li>  A little more professional colleagues in Yandex and JetBrains </li><li>  The greatest technological expertise at Yandex, JetBrains and Kaspersky Lab </li><li>  The possibilities of deepening existing knowledge are slightly more than others at Yandex, Mail.ru Group and JetBrains </li><li>  Acquiring new skills and changing specialization is possible in Grid Dynamics and Yandex, Wrike and JetBrains </li></ol><br>  <b>3. Social prestige</b> <br><br><ol><li>  It is more prestigious to work in Yandex, JetBrains and Vkontakte </li><li>  More interesting projects are Yandex, JetBrains, Wargaming and Mail.ru Group. </li><li>  Noticeably more actively involved in the life of the IT community Yandex, Mail.ru Group, EPAM and JetBrains. </li></ol><br>  If we held a competition for the title of the best employer according to the above-mentioned evaluation criteria, we would have the following winners: <br><br><ul><li>  1 place is shared by <b>Yandex and JetBrains</b> .  They are the undisputed leaders in almost all criteria: each was named one of the best by 8 criteria out of 12. </li><li>  2nd place is shared by <b>Mail.ru Group and Grid Dynamics</b> .  Each was named one of the best by 4 criteria out of 12. </li><li>  3rd place is shared by <b>EPAM and Wrike</b> .  Each was named one of the best by 2 criteria out of 12. </li></ul><br>  If we had a competition in the above conditional nominations: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Yandex and JetBrains</b> would win in the nomination "Professional Development" and "Social Prestige".  They were named among the best by all criteria in these conditional nominations. </li><li>  <b>Grid Dynamics</b> would win in the nomination ‚ÄúWorking conditions and career‚Äù.  This company was named one of the best by 3 out of 5 criteria in this nomination. </li></ul><br><hr><br>  By the way, at My Circle there are currently open vacancies of most companies that we talked about in this report: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://moikrug.ru/companies/kaspersky/vacancies">Jobs Kaspersky Lab</a> <br></li><li>  <a href="https://moikrug.ru/companies/sbertech/vacancies">Sberbank-Technology Jobs</a> <br></li><li>  <a href="https://moikrug.ru/companies/yandex/vacancies">Jobs Yandex</a> <br></li><li>  <a href="https://moikrug.ru/companies/avito/vacancies">Avito Jobs</a> <br></li><li>  <a href="https://moikrug.ru/companies/badoo/vacancies">Badoo Jobs</a> <br></li><li>  <a href="https://moikrug.ru/companies/db/vacancies">Deutsche Bank Jobs</a> <br></li><li>  <a href="https://moikrug.ru/companies/jetbrains/vacancies">JetBrains Jobs</a> <br></li><li>  <a href="https://moikrug.ru/companies/luxoft/vacancies">Luxoft Jobs</a> <br></li><li>  <a href="https://moikrug.ru/companies/mailrugroup/vacancies">Jobs Mail.ru Group</a> <br></li><li>  <a href="https://moikrug.ru/companies/parallels/vacancies">Parallels Jobs</a> <br></li><li>  <a href="https://moikrug.ru/companies/rambler-co/vacancies">Vacancy Rambler</a> <br></li><li>  <a href="https://moikrug.ru/companies/wrike/vacancies">Jobs Wrike</a> <br></li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/342258/">https://habr.com/ru/post/342258/</a></p>
