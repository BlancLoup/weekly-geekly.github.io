But I want to share with my experience a bit of what I did not write about (at least I did not see). <br><br>  Those who tinker with water press, I think, this plugin is known, and I don‚Äôt want to paint its main features.  And I want to paint flash player types for viewing photos in NextGen galleries. <br><br><h4>  Drove off </h4><br>  After installing the plugin itself, you can use the slideshow built into it and viewing with the PicLens player.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Slide show </h4><br>  For correct work, he also needs the <a href="http://www.longtailvideo.com/players/jw-image-rotator/">Imagerotator</a> . <br><br>  Download the imagerotator.swf file from the archive to wp-content / uploads /, then go to yourdomain.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=ngggl-options page, on the Slideshow tab, specify the path to the enty file, and on the Gallery tab enable and customize slideshow. <br><br>  What we get?  Here's what: <br><br><img src="http://img8.imageshost.ru/imgs/100114/7e2faa5650/98d6c.jpg"><br><br>  In principle, such a normal player, but too small controls and no thumbnails.  And the rest is fine - I liked. <br><br><h4>  Piclens </h4><br>  This of course Stuck with a capital letter.  :) On yourdomain.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=ngggl-options page, on the General Options tab, we enable Piclens support. <br><br>  Here's what it looks like: <br><br><img src="http://img8.imageshost.ru/imgs/100114/6ac5d2568b/76233.jpg"><br><br>  I really liked it.  Everything is good - the player is very well made, the thumbnails are convenient, there is a full-screen view.  But there are no settings at all (well, the Russian site, such a module with an aglitsky interface does not look like), and this 3D View is in the way.  What is it - I did not really understand, but when I learned that I needed to download something for him, I realized that I did not need it.  And in general, for me personally this is overkill.  There is no way to remove it.  But be that as it may, the impression is very positive. <br><br>  These players gives us a standard plugin.  But you can have one more thing. <br><br><h4>  Galleryview </h4><br>  When you install the NextGen Galleryview module (download <a href="">here</a> ), you can get another player.  This is not a flash player, this canoe is made on JS.  To view, you need to enable the downloaded and installed plugin, and specify a tag on the page: [nggallery id = 1 template = galleryview images = 0] <br><br>  Here is what we get: <br><br><img src="http://img8.imageshost.ru/imgs/100114/ab77647303/d18bc.jpg"><br><br>  The image shows that it is crooked.  The fact is that there either CSS is not finished, or something else.  But they immediately warn about it - it is sensitive to the CSS of the theme itself.  As a result, if there is a non-standard theme (and who has it standard?), The plugin will have to be cruelly processed with a file.  Another of the minuses - too miniature miniatures.  In short, the plugin is not impressed. <br><br>  Now a small review of other players that are not included in the basic package, so to speak. <br><br><h4>  NextGen Smooth Player </h4><br>  Standard repositories have a NextGEN Smooth Gallery plugin.  We put it, activate it.  On the page <a href="http://yourdomain.com/wp-admin/admin.php%3Fpage%3Dnextgen-smooth-gallery">yourdomain.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=nextgen-smooth-gallery</a> everything is customizable.  Then to view the gallery on the page you need to insert a tag: [smooth = id: 1]. <br><br>  Here is the result: <br><br><img src="http://img8.imageshost.ru/imgs/100114/a9673e9f72/64a51.jpg"><br><br>  Personally, I liked it the most, and I use it.  It can be customized and convenient, and made with high quality.  The only drawback is that it does not fit the image to its size, but simply cuts it off.  Therefore, if I have a player on the page with a size of 640x480, then I‚Äôm uploading photos to a server of the same size. <br><br>  Further 4 more players, we <s>will continue after advertising, stay with us</s> , they are all configured the same. <br><br>  Install the NextGEN FlashViewer plugin from the standard repositories, activate it.  On <a href="http://yourdomain.com/wp-admin/admin.php%3Fpage%3Dnggallery-flashviewer">yourdomain.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=ngggallery-flashviewer</a> page you will be offered to download the players themselves (you need their swf files).  Download, upload files, everything is configured on the same page. <br><br><h4>  Autoviewer </h4><br>  Tag on page: [autoviewer id = "1" width = "640" height = "480"] <br><br><img src="http://img8.imageshost.ru/imgs/100114/1d4494fbaa/42bd2.jpg"><br><br>  Enough simple player-listalka.  Management is simple, no frills.  But I was not particularly impressed, it was too simple.  Although someone, perhaps enough of this. <br><br><h4>  Tiltviewer </h4><br>  Tag on page: [tiltviewer id = "1" width = "640" height = "480"] <br><br>  Preview gallery: <br><br><img src="http://img8.imageshost.ru/imgs/100114/755501fec9/59d51.jpg"><br><br>  View image: <br><br><img src="http://img8.imageshost.ru/imgs/100114/b33cfb72a8/36e87.jpg"><br><br>  Some strange player with wriggling photos.  In addition to the above twisting, I did not see anything special. <br><br><h4>  Postcards viewer </h4><br>  Tag on page: [pcviewer id = "1" width = "640" height = "480"] <br><br>  Preview gallery: <br><br><img src="http://img8.imageshost.ru/imgs/100114/0600228636/24fa1.jpg"><br><br>  View image: <br><br><img src="http://img8.imageshost.ru/imgs/100114/e95cb812a0/965ea.jpg"><br><br>  A curious player that "hangs" images in the form of cards.  But it is suitable for ODA.  design, not everywhere will look think.  And you need to adjust it with caution, otherwise viewing images will be terrible.  And so - quite an original thing. <br><br>  There was also a Simpleviewer.  In fact, a parody of the Smooth player.  As if he looked miserable, I didn‚Äôt even want to do the screen of his monitor - in general, IMHO, crap. <br><br><h4>  Results ... </h4><br>  Well, here is such a reviewer plugin.  :) I have suffered with these galleries, maybe it will be easier for someone to look at the review and immediately select the right one. <br><br><h4>  ... and a little reflection and philosophy </h4><br>  I‚Äôve made a photo gallery, to be honest.  Not too many materials, you have to do a lot at random.  But I, apparently, did find what I wanted.  Also, the fact that when searching for a plugin cannot be sorted by rating.  Because of this, finding good things in a pile of gamna is not a megaprose task. <br><br>  And finally, a curious quote in the subject: <br><br><blockquote>  (02:27:22) George: did you use some kind of a photo gallery for yourself on WordPress? <br><br>  (02:27:26) George: Th I swung <br><br>  (02:36:24) Kerk: I tried it somehow, but it turned out shit :-) <br><br>  (02:36:30) George: :) <br><br>  (02:36:36) George: I'm not the only one) </blockquote><br><br>  That's it.  I have nothing against WordPress, I love it very much, but it is not perfect either. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/80798/">https://habr.com/ru/post/80798/</a></p>
