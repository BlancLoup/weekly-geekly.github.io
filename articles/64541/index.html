  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What to do if the payment terminal did not issue a check</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  According to the new Law, when paying through the terminal, at the time of receipt of the check, the service is considered to be rendered.  The law will take effect in 2010.  But checks are needed now. <br>  What to do if the machine did not issue a check (or it was lost, and the payment did not come)? <br><br>  Read below the instructions provided by the OSMP technical support service. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  The meaning of the majority of calls to technical support, in situations where a check was not issued, is as follows: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      1. The payment was successfully credited to the account, but the check is needed for reporting. <br>  2. Payment is not received. <br><br>  <b>Reasons for which the check may not be issued:</b> <br><br>  - the printer is out of paper; <br>  - there is still paper in the printer, but it is not enough in the roll and, due to the design of some models of printers, the check did not come out through the corresponding slot in the device and stayed inside; <br>  - technical malfunction of the printer (for example, paper is lashed); <br>  - the device rebooted during payment, or the power supply was turned off; <br>  - when depositing funds into your personal account, the device moved from the payment page to the start page.  At the same time, the money was deposited into the device, and the actions of forming a payment were not completed; <br>  - if you pay with funds that are already in your Personal Account, the check is not issued.  The terminal in this case simply replaces the computer, providing access to the online service. <br><br>  <b>How to get a check when paying with the balance of the Personal Account?</b> <br>  The check can be printed from the site.  To do this, go to <a href="http://mylk.qiwi.ru/">mylk.qiwi.ru</a> and log in.  Generate a report for the date of payment, find the desired payment.  Next to the transaction number will be a yellow ‚ÄúCheck‚Äù link.  Links will not be if the payment failed.  For all unsuccessful payments made through the Personal Account, the funds are automatically returned to the balance of the Personal Account. <br><br>  <b>What can be done in other situations?</b> <br><br>  1. If the payment was successful, but the check was not issued, it is enough to write a letter to claim@osmp.ru explaining the situation, as well as the invoice number, date, and estimated time of payment.  All received calls of subscribers are registered by the claims department.  Each appeal is automatically assigned a number, which is used later in correspondence. <br>  After receiving the letter, the claim department specialists will prepare a certificate confirming the fact of payment.  The certificate will contain basic data: the date and time of payment, terminal numbers, accounts, receipts and transactions, as well as the amount of payment and to transfer.  An electronic copy will be sent by email.  The original can be obtained at the office of the company by prior arrangement. <br><br>  2. If the check has not been issued and the payment has not been received. <br>  It is important to find out the number of the terminal.  If the device still works, then on the start page there should be a gray round button with the letter ‚Äúi‚Äù.  When you click on this button, a page with information about the terminal opens: its number, address, information about the owner of the device.  Also, if there are checks from previous payments made on this machine, you can find the number on them. <br>  If the machine has disconnected, or there is no button on the screen to view the information, then you can try to check with the store administration where the device is located, how to contact the owner. <br><br>  <b>When the terminal number is known, half the problem is solved.</b> <br><br>  Next, you will need to write a letter explaining the situation, terminal number, date and time of payment. <br>  If money was deposited into an account in the Personal Account, and then payment was made through it, you will need to specify the number of the Personal Account and at least one of the numbers that were paid. <br>  If you experience problems with the payment through the "QIWI Personal Cabinet", you need to write a letter to: support@mobw.ru <br><br>  Specialists of the claim department will need time to deal with the reasons that the funds were not credited to the account.  Also, some time will be spent on communication with the agent who owns the terminal.  He is required to request logs from the machine, as well as data about collection. <br>  If the machine was not in the room, but on the street, the check was not issued, the terminal number cannot be determined. <br><br>  It should be in a letter with the support service to inform the city and the exact address of the building, near which the machine is located.  As well as the payment number, details, date and amount. <br>  In any situation, the more you manage to communicate information about the "lost" payment, the greater the chance that it will be found quickly.  Also, it is better to contact the TP as soon as possible. <br>  It is advisable to leave a mobile phone number for communication so that you can quickly clarify information if necessary.  If the phone is home, you need to specify the area code. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/64541/">https://habr.com/ru/post/64541/</a></p>
