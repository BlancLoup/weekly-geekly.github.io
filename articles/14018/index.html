  <section class="page js-page"><h1>deliGoo - to help del.icio.us users</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I set myself <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a> in the spring of 2006 and immediately began to densely fill there links to interesting articles and sites that I encountered during my travels.  But when after a couple of weeks I tried to find a link to the necessary article, which (I remember exactly!) I saved in a delishis - I was severely disappointed. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  By inexperience, I saved the links, not really worrying about the tags accompanying them.  Just chose from the list of popular tags those that seemed appropriate.  I added my own ones there, then in Russian, then in English, and sometimes I even inserted in the tag field phrases like ‚Äúsearch on blogs‚Äù.  In the end, I saw my list of tags in del.icio.us, I was horrified.  Sausage on three screens, numerous variations like "web, web2.0, web", not to mention all sorts of cute tags "and", "by", etc.  It is clear that to find anything with their help was simply unrealistic. <br><br>  I tried the del.icio.us standard search.  And also broke off - I could not find anything with it.  Moreover, in many cases I wrote a brief description of the bookmark being saved, but when I began to search, for some reason, not the words I wrote in the description or tags, but rather those fragments of phrases and expressions that stuck in my head after reading the desired article. <br><br>  At this stage I had an idea - for such a common service as del.icio.us there should be a normal search - not by tags and description, but by the content of the bookmarks.  And I began to look for him.  Rummaged nemeryanno sites with all sorts of gadgets and plug-ins, necessary and not very much, but I did not find such a search.

        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"

      <br>
      I had to go back to the beginning - I cleaned the extra tags, added more detailed descriptions to the saved bookmarks (good, there were still not very many of them then).  Began to pick and think more thoughtfully about adding new tags.  It became better, but not much.  I still could not quickly find the article I needed in order to quote from it. <br><br>  The idea to make a normal search, which would be searched specifically for the content of the ‚Äúmortgaged‚Äù sites and pages, did not leave me.  In the autumn-winter of 2006, we tried to do it, but it turned out to be not so simple.  And only after the appearance of the new <a href="http://www.google.com/coop/">Google Custom Search Engine</a> functionality, we made a second, this time a successful attempt, which was called <a href="http://www.deligoo.com/ru/">deliGoo</a> . <br><br>  This thing is done as an add-on, currently running under IE and FF.  Using deliGoo is simple and obvious - by default, it offers to search for any word or phrase based on the bookmarks of the user del.icio.us.  In principle, you can substitute the name of any user there, although it is unlikely that someone might need it :) <br><br>  For those who have order in the tags, you can limit the search area in your bookmarks also by a specific tag.  But if you do not specify a username, but only a tag, then you get something like a specialized search engine on a given topic: deliGoo will select sites saved by this tag by <strong>all</strong> del.icio.us users, and the search for the necessary words and expressions will be done only these sites. <br><br>  For example, it‚Äôs worth nothing in two clicks to make a search engine on the ‚Äúlinux‚Äù or ‚ÄúiPod‚Äù tag - and further search for the necessary information already in the context of sites of a given subject matter. <br><br>  For popular tags, the process of creating such a custom search engine may take several minutes, but then you can quickly search for any number of queries.  At the same time, the deliGoo process is optimized, and if the search engine for such a tag has already been created, then the second time the process will be much faster. <br><br>  It is clear that deliGoo does not pretend to capture the world, but we are pleased that it turned out to create a truly convenient tool for users of the most popular bookmark service. <br><br>  ... and how glad I am that I can finally find what I need in my bookmarks!  :) <br><br>  PS I want to say that I wrote this announcement specifically for Habr, and with vested interest - I want to ask the habra people who use del.icio.us to test deliGoo and write down possible questions or found bugs in comments.  Thanks in advance to everyone who responds! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/14018/">https://habr.com/ru/post/14018/</a></p>
