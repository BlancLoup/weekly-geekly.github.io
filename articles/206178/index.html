  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Cloud hosting for a simple site</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The advantages of cloud technologies and some problems of virtual hosting, which will be mentioned below, made us think about the question: how much does it cost to place a simple website on a cloud hosting. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Hosting is usually referred to as the first cloud computing model - Infrastructure as a Service, IaaS (infrastructure as a service), where the user is provided with basic computing resources on which he can deploy and execute arbitrary software.  In other words, cloud hosting is positioned as an alternative to the server rental service (Dedicated Server) or virtual machine (VDS), which implies a higher cost than hosting on a virtual hosting. <br>  One of the important advantages of cloud hosting is cost effectiveness.  This is due to the lack of the need to invest a large amount at the start of the project, as well as the ability to pay according to the ‚Äúhow much you spent, how much you paid‚Äù scheme.  However, the minimum configuration that can be purchased often exceeds the need for computing resources.  In addition, there remains the need to purchase software licenses. <br><br>  Payment flexibility can play a bad joke if there is no confidence in the security of the site and the flawlessness of the code of its software.  There are many site owners who don‚Äôt think at all about the need to control the use of system resources.  It is also doubtful whether it is necessary to predict how much processor capacity and RAM your site will need.  It‚Äôs like when buying a car to require the buyer to specify the maximum torque and engine power in kilowatts. <br><br>  Now that does not suit us on a shared hosting.  The problem of the ‚ÄúBad Neighbor‚Äù is widely known, when increasing the load on one site slows down or blocks the work of others.  This problem is solved by the fact that the provider imposes restrictions on the consumption of system resources.  This is very inconvenient - it's like putting a speed limiter of 60 km / h in your car. If you want to go faster, then pay extra.

      More promising for hosting sites, in our opinion, is the PaaS cloud computing model (Platform as a Service) that provides ready-made services for developers for a fixed monthly fee.  This model allows you to get services with a high level of availability and fault tolerance, due to the property of computational elasticity to ensure the allocation of necessary system resources to each site, and to scale the computing resources without stopping the service. <br><br>  The idea arose to create a service that provides the benefits of cloud hosting to a wide range of users, namely <a href="http://risp.ru/%3Fcloud_host">site hosting hosted on a cloud platform</a> .  From the user's point of view, this service is no different from the usual site hosting.  The client gets access to a multifunctional web-interface for site management, access to an ftp server and ssh access.  Each account is allocated 1 GB of RAM, processor resources are not limited.  The price is from 175 rubles.  per month.  Expansion of disk space from 5 to 20 rubles per year for 1 GB. <br><br><h5>  Platform Description </h5><br>  The cloud server resides on a failover cluster consisting of a pool of high-performance Intel Xeon 56xx series servers with an EMC VNX storage system.  This is a modern, ultra-reliable way to host data, built on the platform of the world's leading virtualization company VMware. <br><br>  VMware High Availability (HA) technology minimizes downtime caused by server or operating system failures at no additional cost.  The system monitors the state of virtual machines in order to detect failures of the operating system or physical servers.  When a failure is detected, the virtual machines automatically restart on another physical high-availability cluster server. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/498/12f/d04/49812fd04e68c0be5d961d59f4f8e203.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  All servers in the cluster use shared data storage, so there is no need to copy the data and restart almost instantly.  That is, if on a normal physical server a hard disk failure can result in an idle service, the situation here is basically impossible. <br><br>  The data storage uses the new generation EMC VNX storage platform, which is equipped with Intel Quad Core Xeon 5600 series CPU and 6 Gb / s SAS internal disk interfaces.  Multi-level data storage, combining the use of flash drives and hard drives, as well as the placement of the most active data in the cache memory, provides high performance and easily cope with mass requests. <br><br>  Cloud data center allows you to meet the needs of projects of any complexity.  When there are not enough allocated resources to perform server tasks, you can increase the amount of RAM and disk space in minutes.  The test period for site placement is 1 month.  If the site hosting capacity is not enough for your project, we can provide a dedicated virtual server. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/206178/">https://habr.com/ru/post/206178/</a></p>
