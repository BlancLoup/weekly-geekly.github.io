Finding that you can buy a book about this eternally hungry kote, also in a Russian store, I decided to add it to the list of New Year's gifts.  I went to the <a href="http://www.livebooks.ru/">website of the online store</a> , I registered, I also selected a couple of nice New Year cards in addition to the booklet and sent an order for, as it turned out, symbolic 404 rubles. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I was pleased that on the same day, on Sunday, the store employee wrote, I clarified a couple of points and confirmed the order (yes, I was warned about the speed of delivery, but I still decided to take a chance). <br>  Further we follow according to the <a href="http://russianpost.ru/rp/servise/ru/home/postuslug/trackingpo">tracking</a> data <a href="http://russianpost.ru/rp/servise/ru/home/postuslug/trackingpo">of the Russian Post</a> (the page of which very unsuccessfully moved to the new version of the site - spent a lot of time searching for it): <br><br> <a title="Habraffe.ru" href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/6d/4f/6d4f304c3a0bfe52766ac03e04a13979.png"></a>

      <i>December 21st</i> .  The parcel arrived at the MOSCOW 207 fire station. <br>  <i>December 28th</i> .  Came to the sorting center of my city. <br>  <i>On the 29th</i> , I ran to my post office to find out if I hadn‚Äôt come.  Did not come. <br><br>  <i>December 31st</i> .  Immediately after the offset went to the post office.  I decided that in three days I should definitely have time to get from one end of the city to the other, and I really wanted to catch the new year.  They said that so far there is nothing on my name. <br><br>  I didn‚Äôt rush things here and decided to calmly wait for the notification.  So, without having waited until <i>mid-January</i> , I went again and once again heard that nothing had come.  There was no time to sort it out - the session, and for exceeding the maximum delivery time, as I understand it, it was possible to demand compensation in the amount of 3% of the declared value of the item. <br><br>  <i>On January 28</i> , having gone on vacation and without receiving a single notice, I first went to find out about my parcel post.  Of course, it never appeared. <br><br>  <i>February 1</i>  Wrote a statement asking to find my parcel post.  They promised to solve the problem within a month. <br><br>  Periodically looking at the tracking, the numbers <i>9</i> or <i>10</i> noticed that the parcel went back to the addressee for the expiration date.  I went to my post office to find out how it was - the parcel turned out to be, but they didn‚Äôt give it to me either at the time of my personal visit.  According to the employee‚Äôs story, I understood the following: the statement stimulated the workers to search the parcel more diligently, and it was not found where all the departures were waiting for the recipients.  And when her search began, one of the workers, not knowing this story, sent the parcel post back, as it lay already longer than it was supposed to.  I was asked if I needed her, and if she didn‚Äôt have enough time to leave, you can send a request for her return.  I agreed. <br>  A little later, in response to my application, I received a letter with the following content: <br><blockquote>  The check established that the parcel post [...] sent on December 21, 2009 was returned on February 8, 2010 at the return address. <br>  A letter on its return to your address was sent to the place of reception [...] on February 15, 2010. </blockquote><br>  <i>March 1</i> , as seen on the tracking, the parcel was handed to the sender.  I did not receive any more news from the post office. <br><br>  So, through no fault of my own, I did not receive a shipment sent by the ‚Äú <a href="http://russianpost.ru/">Post of Russia</a> ‚Äù.  Equally did not receive any official apology, nor any other information.  And the matter is not even in this book, in its place there could be something much more important - documents, private correspondence, etc., but the ease with which such a company can score on all its obligations.  I just recovered, one of these days I will go to find out whether I can still count on something in this unpleasant story.  And what would you do / advise you to do? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/284502/">https://habr.com/ru/post/284502/</a></p>
