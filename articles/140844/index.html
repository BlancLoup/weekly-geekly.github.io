Our company has been engaged in tourist trips in the Khabarovsk Territory for a long time, and decided to designate its activities for planned development as well. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4b6/acc/0fb/4b6acc0fbac8be374439e4ddbfbefae0.jpg" align="right" alt="image"><br><br>  The director set the task to create his own website, which would allow to publish all the current information, hot offers and reviews of tourists about their holiday. <br><br>  To me as a public relations manager, if taken officially.  And as the youngest guy, if you take really.  We set the task to make a website and allocated for it ‚Äútearing away from the heart‚Äù 30 thousand rubles.  All my activities can be divided into several stages:

      <b>1) Collection of primary information:</b> <br><br>  In order to understand how to run the site, I turned for help to my friend, who was studying for 4th year on an IT specialist in economics and banking. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  He helped me make a small brief on the site.  I also investigated the sites of competitors and sites of the leaders of this industry.  Understand how it should look like. <br><br>  He also advised me to immediately buy a future domain, which I did.  I designed it for myself, so that later there will be an opportunity to blackmail the director. <br><br>  <b>2) Visit a web design studio.</b> <br><br>  As for me, reporting was, first of all, I decided to use the services of a small studio, which was completely alongside my work.  I had a brochure of our company, I had an exemplary brief, I had the desire and time to work. <br><br>  I went to the site of this studio.  I was embarrassed that he did not open on the explorer.  I looked through the portfolio of works.  In general, I was satisfied. <br><br>  But in the studio itself I was expecting a slight disappointment.  When I entered the studio, one of the workers answered the question: ‚ÄúWhy doesn‚Äôt the flash load on your website?‚Äù Made it look as if I was an ‚Äúenemy of the people‚Äù.  ‚ÄúThis is a Java script,‚Äù to me then, it didn‚Äôt say much, however, now too. <br><br>  I was assured that the studio has more than 6 years of experience.  But they could not say how much the site would cost.  It is quite annoying when the total amount is said to be from 30 to 150. Plus, the blog posting panel about your trip caused a big problem for them. <br>  They advised me to "Understand whether I need this site at all."  Also sent me to the site habrahabr.ru <br><br>  <b>3) Inspiration from habra.</b> <br><br>  At Habr√©, I realized that the stage of creating a site consists of: Design, Layout, Layout, Programming, and Seo-optimization. <br><br>  To collect my thoughts and finally fulfill the task assigned to me.  I made an approximate prototype and description of the site, so that I need.  It looked quite funny, but for a man who does not understand anything in this area, it turned out well. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c49/65d/0df/c4965d0df53c7db5319bbf8859af1f27.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>4) Search for potential performers.</b> <br><br>  After I had a draft prototype, brief, approximate understanding of how Bitrix differs from Umi, I sent requests to a number of companies with a very simple and concise question: ‚ÄúHow long and for how long?‚Äù <br><br>  Here, perhaps, I saw one of the biggest problems of web design: there are no clear standards for how much it costs and how long it is done.  How much inquiry I wouldn‚Äôt do, I always received different answers about the time and cost for the same project.  And if you consider that this is a typical site, then I generally stayed in a light shock. <br><br>  <b>5) The final selection and start of work.</b> <br><br>  At one point I received a letter of reply, which I could not refuse.  I received a letter where the manager wrote by hours and stages how much the site would cost.  What documents are needed for this.  How will be all the cooperation.  What are the restrictions on penalties.  In other words, they sent me what I was able to show my director and calmly justify the site‚Äôs budget. <br><br>  At the moment, this studio is developing our company website.  There are, of course, minor inaccuracies in the timing, and the price varies slightly.  But the way the manager provides us with all the information leaves us in full understanding of where our money goes. <br><br>  In order to find the artist who can implement the site.  I had to study a lot of information.  I met a misunderstanding in the studios, which do not understand that they should help me, and they will not do ‚Äúso be it‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>I am very interested in the question: ‚ÄúWhen people like you come to you at the first stage.</b>  <b>What are you doing?"</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/140844/">https://habr.com/ru/post/140844/</a></p>
