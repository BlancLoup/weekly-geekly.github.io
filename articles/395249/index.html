  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Summer Mobilization GearBest</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Do not you think that summer is a very ambiguous time of year?  On the one hand, this is the season of vacations, warmth, flowering, recreation, light clothing, bicycles, pleasant evenings and weekends in nature.  But on the other hand, this is a hectic, short season, which ends with getting out of vacation, going to school or university, and urgently looking for things you need for work, study, and the cold autumn-winter life. <br><br>  Summer is a difficult season for business, it is always a guaranteed drop in customer flow, interest and profitability.  That is why many stores arrange very interesting summer sales to attract customers.  And customers often miss a good opportunity to prepare a sleigh in the summer - simply because the laptop or PC is also relaxing, and surfing the huge online stores from the tablet or phone is terribly uncomfortable.  But this is not the only thing that motivated us to create a mobile application for tablets and Android smartphones. <br><br> <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/gearbest/blog/277208/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5b6/829/4b7/5b68294b7bdf4989bd3a80ac5334cb6c.png"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  According to a Yandex <a href="https://yandex.ru/company/researches/2016/ya_search_2016">study</a> , tablets are the most "home" devices: they are more often used for surfing the Internet on weekends and in the evenings on weekdays.  The same person can use different devices for the same day: for example, at work - a computer, at lunchtime - a phone, and at home on the couch - a tablet.  In addition, it is on Saturday and Sunday that the largest number of requests from the tablets are made.  According to another Yandex <a href="https://yandex.ru/company/researches/2015/ya_ecommerce">study,</a> when choosing and buying goods from online stores, people are increasingly using mobile devices - tablets and smartphones.  Almost 30% of respondents have already made purchases on the Internet from a smartphone, and half of them made orders through special applications.

    <h2>  Anatomy of the GearBest application </h2><br>  That is why at the very beginning of the summer we want to introduce you to the mobile app GearBest.  While it is available only in English for users around the world.  You can find it on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.globalegrow.app.gearbest">Google Play at the link</a> or at the request ‚Äúgearbest‚Äù - a stylish black and white logo is hard not to notice.  The application occupies 27.90 MB in the device's memory, it works quite quickly. <br><br>  In the lower basement menu items are available: <br><br><ul><li>  Category - categories of goods familiar from the main site.  Thanks to the clear icons among the list, it is easy to choose the right one, without even knowing English in principle. <br><br></li><li>  Cart - shopping cart.  Products are added to it using the bright ‚ÄúAdd to cart‚Äù button, and you can go to the basket by clicking the appropriate icon with the label for the number of products to the left of the button. <br><br></li><li>  Video - section of video recordings and video reviews of users and our team.  For convenience, the video is divided into categories according to the class of lots: tablets, smartphones, PCs and networks, wearable electronics, toys, household appliances, and so on.  If you are interested in the subject of review, you can click the "Buy Now" button right under the video and go to the card and a full description of the goods. <br><br></li><li>  Account is a user's personal account from which personal and payment settings are available, as well as the number of orders, favorites, bonuses (points) and reviews. <br></li></ul><br>  On the main page of the application are several sections. <br><br>  <b>Top banner carousel</b> with current promotions held in GearBest.  Banners and promotions change regularly - you can always find something interesting.  And based on the fact that our store is geek oriented, it is also technological. <br><br>  <b>Suggestions for popular gadgets among users at a discount.</b>  If you click the more + link, the application will go to the page where the goods are listed and the discounts on them are indicated.  Filters are also available there - radio beats by category, as well as price, novelty and discount. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/46f/f10/a61/46ff10a61a3b528a7353876539c74016.gif"></div><br>  <b>Below you can see two buttons: New Gadgets and Presale.</b>  The first one hides the newly received high-tech innovations, the second - pre-order for top models and already future market innovations.  A description of the product, its price, as well as an interactive ruler, measuring the time before the start of official sales, is available in the pre-order product card.  The line shows the number of perfect pre-orders - sometimes you really have to hurry to get the desired thing, especially when it comes to new products among tablets or flagship smartphones of famous Chinese manufacturers. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/394/1ab/c13/3941abc1377b1cd615109aa7ef71a0fa.png"></div><br>  The product card itself also contains several sections: product information, a detailed description, reviews, and discussions.  In the top panel of the application, you can switch between the tile and list view, and a quick search in the store is also available.  We searched for the word arduino and this is how it looks. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c70/41c/e8a/c7041ce8a133e9d65fa0c01ff9a0aeca.gif"></div><br>  By the way, about the photos of the goods - their viewing is specially thought out by the developers.  You simply click on the photo and then use the usual gesture to flip through the rest of the photos, increasing them if necessary.  To go back to the description of the product, just click on the image once - the album will collapse and you will continue to study the tactical and technical characteristics or you can proceed to ordering the product.  Here's what it looks like to view the photo album associated with the selected Arduino suite. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/73a/e3d/c2a/73ae3dc2a7cae98b936f57ece2ce12a4.gif"></div><br><br>  Inside the card is available for viewing information about the cost of delivery to the selected region and stock: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/48b/4b6/49b/48b4b649bb121ff636590a1245d74a75.png" width="370"></div><br>  When adding a product, the application offers to select the parameters of the lot, if they are provided for - for example, the memory capacity of the device or the color of the case. <br><br>  The basket is also designed with convenience for mobile purchase.  When placing an order, the user selects the number of each item, and can delete or add to the favorites each item. <br><br>  We are extremely pleased to receive feedback on the application from Russian users - they have already managed to install and evaluate it.  When developing the interface, we took into account all the recommendations of the leaders of e-commerce, thought over usability and optimized the speed of work.  We think, from release to release, new features and conveniences will appear.  And yes, we always welcome bug reports, comments and suggestions.  Break us down completely - we are ready to refine, finish and change as our users want. <br><br><h2>  There will be no discounts? </h2><br>  Discounts will be.  <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/m-promotion-active-229.htm%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">The promotion</a> will last until 09:00 Moscow time on June 17.  During the promotion period, the first 50,000 orders will receive an additional <b>5% discount when paying via PayPal in the Android application</b> and 4% in the mobile version of the site (it is also perfectly optimized). <br><br>  From 20:00 Moscow time on June 14 to June 16, a <b>flash-sale</b> will be loved by users.
