At these levels, an adequate supply of quality labor with a limited number of positions.  Soon this market will be redrawn due to changes in the dollar.  How to quickly reach these levels and even overcome them?

      To do this, it is important to understand that success in the labor market depends primarily on the combination of skills, and not on the depth of ownership of any one issue.  It is important which way you choose, and not how fast you go.  How to know where to go?  Do I need to overtake colleagues or everyone can earn more? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cd9/909/613/cd99096137e04355bf39125cdd882c83.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  C # cluster and developer conferences </h4><br>  The set of C # developers, companies, tools, open source projects is one interconnected cluster.  And the success of the element inside, i.e.  individual developer, is determined by the effectiveness of the cluster as a whole.  The cluster works the more efficiently, the more communication and coordination occurs within the developer environment.  If you share problems and solutions, combine to solve similar problems, the ecosystem will be more efficient and it is more profitable for everyone. <br><br>  The development audience has a lot of needs: find out about updates, see a solution to a complex technical problem, find an employee or a job.  There are many thematic niches and formats.  At one extreme of the formats are conferences that broadcast content, and at the other are unconferences, in which the schedule and schedule are created by participants at the event itself.  Events vary in level of training and volume of marketing.  But no format can satisfy everyone.  You can not combine the novelty of the conference DevCon and the solution of current practical problems.  It is difficult to combine informal communication and deep technical reports.  Therefore, we believe that there should be more different events. <br><br>  In the Russian .Net world there are few events, but they are: <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://www.msdevcon.ru/ru/">DevCon</a> is a large conference from Microsoft, held annually, usually in May in the Moscow region and is usually devoted to technical innovations. </li><li>  various events from Microsoft, for example the <a href="http://events.techdays.ru/appday/2014-11/">Russian App Day</a> , which will be November 21 </li><li>  <a href="http://dotnetconf.ru/">DotNetConf</a> - regional conference on .Net in Chelyabinsk, which began to meet in 2010 </li><li>  <a href="http://dotnext.ru/">DotNext</a> - was held in St. Petersburg in April 2014 and will soon be held in Moscow on December 8, 2014, a ‚Äúhardcore‚Äù conference dedicated to the insides of the CLR, working with memory, profiling and performance </li><li>  <a href="http://www.gosharp.ru/">GoSharp</a> - thematic conferences with short presentations and an emphasis on informal communication (November 15 is a day of personal effectiveness, and December 12 is a team leader day) </li></ul><br>  You can often hear C # developers at regional conferences, as well as large SECR conferences or mobile development events. <br><br>  The more different events will take place from different organizers - the stronger will be the exchange of experience within the C # ecosystem.  We are convinced that coordination between the organizers and the planning of such events will be useful for the community as a whole and will allow closing the spectrum of needs completely. <br><br>  One of the upcoming events takes place with the information support of Luxoft and the participation of one of our trainers, Andrei Gordienkov <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/violettape/" class="user_link">violettape</a> , who is a member of the organizing team and speaker in the Effective Code Writing section.  We would like to share information about the mechanics of networking at such an event and ask for your advice.  Further, the story goes on behalf of the organizers. <br><br><h4>  GoSharpMoscow November 15th and how to earn more </h4><br>  The first day is called "Day of personal effectiveness."  This is the diplomatic designation of the problem that the conference is solving - to help the C # developer to earn more. <br><br>  Finding a path to more income is somewhat similar to a binary search tree, or even a decision tree.  At the very beginning are the most important forks.  Probably everyone remembers puzzles about weighing coins.  So here - you can weigh for a long time, but you can come to the result by taking a few right decisions. <br><br>  All topics and sections at the conference are questions of choice and decisions.  Which tool to choose?  What is the approach?  How to be more productive?  What technology?  From these decisions depends on the productivity and relevance of the developer, and as a result - the level of income.  This day does not add scientific novelty.  But in a short time he allows to understand how to prioritize professional development.  In addition, the format involves the collection of recipes, which can add 3-5% to efficiency.  And 15 such tips - this, as you can easily count, (1.05) ^ 15&gt; 2, can give a doubling of performance.  Each section is organized as follows: several short reports, discussion, and then a coffee break.  First section: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f58/79b/856/f5879b856d324038b90f7e6ab4161370.PNG"><br><br>  Also compactly assembled section on "Mobile development on C #" will help with the choice of UI development technologies in the conditions of rapid growth in the share of mobile devices. <br><br>  In the section ‚ÄúCareer and education of the developer .Net‚Äù in one of the reports you will learn how resistance levels are formed by various forces in the labor market, how income depends on a combination of different characteristics, how career growth is explained by the theory of minima or causes of failure, what are the ways of learning and what is the salary-technological trap. <br><br>  The reports are specially short, but there is enough time so that you can feel the personalities of the speakers and experts and their recommendations.  You can see the program later, the link at the end of the article. <br><br>  You will learn ‚Äúwhere to dig‚Äù in relation to various aspects of professional development, and you will find content for mastering technologies easily, especially if you speak English. <br><br><h4>  Informal communication on GoSharp </h4><br>  In order not only to hear ‚Äúwhere to dig‚Äù from the scene, but also to ask colleagues again, informal communication will be organized.  It allows: <br><ul><li>  exchange information about tasks and corporate culture in companies </li><li>  junior developers to ask mentors for advice </li><li>  project managers and startups - to find people in a team for permanent and remote work </li><li>  Startup managers - to build connections with colleagues who also have their own projects </li><li>  just chat with colleagues to broaden your horizons </li></ul><br>  Often acquaintances begin with discussions in small groups around the speakers after the presentations, yes, or simply when sitting next to each other are exchanged with a couple of phrases.  In order to have more piles, the number of speakers and experts is increased and they will be presented to the audience from the very beginning and involved in the discussion.  The number and duration of breaks is increased - there will be five such time zones with a total duration of 3 hours. <br>  But what is more important - a forced networking will be organized for a part of the audience.  How exactly? <br>  Four tools are stocked: <br><ul><li>  tags on cocktail tables (we can supply 30-40 pieces) </li><li>  speed networking (10 tables) </li><li>  Networking moderators who will work in the hall </li><li>  transfer of discussions to negotiation. </li></ul><br>  Tags on cocktail tables - we have not seen this before at other events, so, of course, this is an experiment with a certain amount of risk.  But surely many of you were annoyed that you could not find a colleague with similar interests at the conference.  Therefore, why not try this method? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/048/f55/6dc/048f556dc1c4487fa0aa2557dc81fece.png"><br><br>  At each cocktail table there is a tag with a tag or name that indicates a sign of grouping.  Then you can drink coffee with people who share your interests.  For example, WPF, WinForms, Silverlight, EF Code First, SQL Server.  Signs, Luxoft Alumni, Kaspersky Alumni or "C # in the regions" are also possible. <br><br>  What would we like?  To the arrangement of tables forced communication.  For example, you can tables "freelancers", "looking for a contractor", "CTO" close to each other.  Some tables let them gather the same participants.  Some of them are suppliers and consumers of a certain type.  How best to do it from a mathematical point of view? <br><br>  Regarding discussions in negotiation.  In them we will transfer conversations with speakers after the sections, if the discussion drags on and it is time to start the next section.  Many speakers promised us to show their applications in a physical implementation - on various mobile devices that they specifically bring for the demonstration. <br>  The speed-deating format will make it possible to establish such connections: the customer is a freelancer, the employer is a developer.  Junior and Middle developers will be able to ask advice from those who are experts or simply work in a company with a strong development culture.  And another format - dinner-afterparty.  Many ask if he will.  Yes, it will be! <br><br><h4>  Additional Information </h4><br>  Program and registration: on the <a href="http://www.gosharp.ru/">conference</a> website. <br>  A little bit about team day 12 December. <br>  Three sections: architecture, project and source code management, organizational structures and labor specialization in the .Net team.  Practices prevail among the speakers - heads of medium and large teams, CTO, resource managers.  It is equipped with reports almost completely, and not everything is reflected on the site (reports have not yet been added from Amazon Web Services in the Architecture section, and Parking.ru report on the creation of infrastructure for distributed turnkey team development).  &gt; 50% of participants on a team day (130 participants and 14 experts) have already registered.  We invite you to join. <br>  Other GoSharp events in 2015 will focus on specific topics: Asp.Net, Desktop / Business Applications, C # Highload, Backend and APIs, C # Clean Code.  Concept: short reports, one track, a lot of communication, affordable price.  More about them and about filing applications for reports - <a href="http://gosharp.ru/Announcements/2015">here</a> . <br><br>  Returning to the tasks of the current day, questions to readers: <br><ul><li>  What are the tag names for cocktail tables that you find useful?  Which tag would you like to approach yourself? </li><li>  What techniques or table layouts can be effective? </li><li>  What parameters of the GoSharp conference (program, format) should be corrected in order to make it more useful to the audience in a given format? </li><li>  What other events in the world of C # /. Net do you know, but we did not mention?  What events are you missing? </li></ul><br><br>  If you have any questions, contact <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/nickevdokimov/" class="user_link">nickevdokimov</a> and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/violettape/" class="user_link">VioletTape</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/242749/">https://habr.com/ru/post/242749/</a></p>
