I studied once myself ... Somehow I even had to conduct a whole course for friends and acquaintances.  During my studies, I noticed that difficulties arise already at the stage of understanding the tables and how to use them.  Many simply could not and cannot develop simple databases.  After a more detailed consideration of such a concept as a table and a small classification, the difficulties of perceiving tables in relational databases almost always disappear.  So! <br><br>  This article will consider a small classification of tables based on integrity and redundancy.  What does it mean?  This means that examples will be given describing what structure of tables you can do to prevent (try to prevent) redundancy and to achieve integrity in relational databases. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  For understanding, we will give brief definitions of data integrity and redundancy:

      <b>Data integrity</b> is a property of the ability to restore others by one data, without losing the semantic unity of this data and the relationship between them (between data). <br><br>  <b>Data redundancy</b> is the state of the database, where extra data is present in the tables. <br><br>  Data integrity may be affected by data modification operations.  If deletion and update operations are prohibited in the database, the integrity can be broken only as a result of the add operation, as well as incorrectly written data display scripts. <br><br><h3>  1. Reference books and bundles </h3><br><h4>  1.1.  Types of tables </h4><br>  We delve a little into the small classification of tables by the types of their structure.  We divide the tables into two general types.  The first type will be reference tables, the second table-bundles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/91e/79c/660/91e79c66005b435e904ffe583dc4afcc.jpg" width="550" height="300" alt="Directories and Bundles"><br>  <i>Figure 1. References and links</i> <br><br>  Information in the tables can be divided into two types.  On information that describes objects (subjects), connections and information that describes actions, processes, events, otherwise. <br><br>  Reference books contain information about objects and subjects, connections.  Bundles contain information about actions, processes, events, and so on. <br><br>  Bundles store data taken from reference tables.  Since it is unprofitable to repeat the same data when describing objects (subjects) and when describing their interaction, data about objects (subjects) are entered in directories, and tables-bundles do not store data of objects (subjects) in their pure form, but only links to them (foreign key).  Thus, bundles store data on the interaction of objects (subjects) and references to the objects (subjects) themselves (foreign key).  These "links" are primary keys in the tables of reference books.  But more about that later ... <br><br>  The reference book differs from a bundle in that reference tables can be independent and independent (that is, when reading the data of some reference books you can understand the semantics in general), and the link tables almost never. <br><br><h4>  1.2.  Types of reference books </h4><br>  Directories can be divided into several types.  These are static, static-dynamic and dynamic reference books.  Of course, it is hardly possible to call an absolutely static reference book, since everything can change in this world.  Or almost everything. <br><br>  <b>A static reference book</b> is a reference book, data about objects, subjects, connections in which either are never subjected to modifications after the initial modification, or are so rarely subjected to modifications that this can be neglected. <br><br>  <i>An example of such directories can serve as a list of months with names and numbers, a list of days of the week, a list of seasons, a list of oceans, and so on ...</i> <br><br><table><tbody><tr><td>  room </td><td>  Name </td></tr><tr><td>  one </td><td>  January </td></tr><tr><td>  2 </td><td>  February </td></tr><tr><td>  3 </td><td>  March </td></tr><tr><td>  four </td><td>  April </td></tr><tr><td>  five </td><td>  May </td></tr><tr><td>  6 </td><td>  June </td></tr><tr><td>  7 </td><td>  July </td></tr><tr><td>  eight </td><td>  August </td></tr><tr><td>  9 </td><td>  September </td></tr><tr><td>  ten </td><td>  October </td></tr><tr><td>  eleven </td><td>  November </td></tr><tr><td>  12 </td><td>  December </td></tr></tbody></table><br>  <i>Table 1. An example of static directories</i> <br><br>  <b>Static-dynamic reference book</b> is a reference book in which data on links are stored, if links are of a reference nature.  In this directory may be foreign keys. <br><br>  <i>The most successful example would be a table with such medical data as weight.</i>  <i>The list of people whose weight is measured, does not change so often.</i>  <i>But the data on their weight can vary every day.</i>  <i>Static-dynamic directories are the only directories where you can consciously repeat any information.</i>  <i>Another example would be the salary reference for posts (by job code).</i> <br><br><table><tbody><tr><td>  Job ID </td><td>  Salary </td><td>  Update Date </td></tr><tr><td>  1001 </td><td>  12,000 </td><td>  02/05/2015 </td></tr><tr><td>  1002 </td><td>  17,000 </td><td>  02/01/2015 </td></tr><tr><td>  1003 </td><td>  11,500 </td><td>  02/01/2015 </td></tr><tr><td>  1004 </td><td>  25 450 </td><td>  02/01/2015 </td></tr><tr><td>  1005 </td><td>  10,000 </td><td>  02/01/2015 </td></tr><tr><td>  1006 </td><td>  6,000 </td><td>  02.02.2015 </td></tr></tbody></table><br>  <i>Table 2. An example of static-dynamic directories</i> <br><br>  <b>Dynamic reference books</b> are tables, data about objects, subjects, links in which change frequently and are used in other tables.  They differ from static reference books only in the frequency of data modification in them. <br><br>  <i>An example of such tables may be lists of projects.</i>  <i>In fact, data on the opening or closing of projects may be in the directory of projects, which in most cases is wrong and violates the integrity.</i>  <i>On the other hand, if you keep a history of changes in the opening and closing (suspension) of projects, you can get data redundancy.</i>  <i>The integrity and redundancy of the data will fight each other for a long time, as well as winter with summer.</i> <br><br><table><tbody><tr><td>  Project code </td><td>  Project </td><td>  Standard deadline </td><td>  Date added </td><td>  User </td></tr><tr><td>  PT102 </td><td>  Painting windows </td><td>  15 </td><td>  01/03/2014 </td><td>  1547 </td></tr><tr><td>  PT103 </td><td>  Door installation </td><td>  ten </td><td>  01/04/2014 </td><td>  9874 </td></tr><tr><td>  PT587 </td><td>  Fire Crane Inspection </td><td>  2 </td><td>  01/04/2014 </td><td>  1456 </td></tr><tr><td>  PT588 </td><td>  Replacing hatches </td><td>  3 </td><td>  01.02.2014 </td><td>  0147 </td></tr><tr><td>  PT133 </td><td>  Channel cleaning </td><td>  eleven </td><td>  02/09/2015 </td><td>  1547 </td></tr></tbody></table><br>  <i>Table 3.

Reference types</i> <br><br><h4>  1.3.  Types of ligaments </h4><br>  Table-bundles can be divided into two types. <br><br>  This is a <b>reference book</b> (we‚Äôll immediately clarify that a reference book is not a reference book, so named because there are fields in it that make up the reference book but cannot be selected in the reference book).  The table in which foreign keys are stored, data that are not reference, and fields containing data that form the reference book but cannot be separated into a separate reference table. <br><br>  <i>An example of a reference-bunch will be a table of payment transactions.</i>  <i>Or a table with data about a football match.</i> <br><table><tbody><tr><td>  Transaction code </td><td>  Payer </td><td>  Recipient </td><td>  Amount </td><td>  date </td><td>  Comment </td></tr><tr><td>  EEVS-doodi4 </td><td>  100045 </td><td>  57457 </td><td>  -10 000 </td><td>  07.25.2014 </td><td>  On boots </td></tr><tr><td>  UDFD-ioeed9 </td><td>  455780 </td><td>  10024 </td><td>  -900 </td><td>  06.24.2014 </td><td>  Null </td></tr><tr><td>  Pedd-jdksl4 </td><td>  144770 </td><td>  56698 </td><td>  -6980 </td><td>  01/01/2015 </td><td>  Null </td></tr><tr><td>  FDFE-keiiii0 </td><td>  447757 </td><td>  one </td><td>  120 </td><td>  07/08/2014 </td><td>  Null </td></tr></tbody></table><br>  <i>Table 4. Sample reference-bundles</i> <br><br>  And a <b>bunch</b> (yes, just a bunch).  This is a table in which only foreign keys and data that cannot be attributed to reference data are stored, for example, the date or values ‚Äã‚Äãof logical fields. <br><br>  <i>An example of a link will be a table for automatic logging of a data processing terminal.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>By the way, it is easy to guess that the bundles are almost never used, because most often there is data that can be written to the database, but not contained in reference books, so it is impossible to compare them with a foreign key.</i> <br><table><tbody><tr><td>  Code </td><td>  Client code </td><td>  Meter readings </td><td>  Month </td></tr><tr><td>  2334 </td><td>  35643 </td><td>  50 </td><td>  01/01/2015 </td></tr><tr><td>  2335 </td><td>  235673 </td><td>  49 </td><td>  01/01/2015 </td></tr><tr><td>  2335 </td><td>  436345 </td><td>  56 </td><td>  01/01/2015 </td></tr><tr><td>  2335 </td><td>  574733 </td><td>  24 </td><td>  01/01/2015 </td></tr></tbody></table><br>  <i>Table 5. Sample bundles</i> <br><br>  It is necessary to clarify what these fields are that form the reference book, but cannot be separated into a separate reference table.  Examples of such fields are the ‚Äúcomment‚Äù, ‚Äúcomplaint‚Äù, ‚Äúdescription‚Äù, ‚Äúsentence‚Äù fields.  In short, if you give a popular example, the field "message" in the database table of any social network ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f6d/eae/8b6/f6deae8b6b6f490c9f0efca17186d406.jpg" width="550" height="300" alt="Types of ligaments"><br>  <i>Figure 3.

Table classification scheme in relational databases based on integrity and data redundancy</i> <br><br><h3>  3. Some comments on the use of classification </h3><br><h4>  3.1.  Apply classification when normalizing tables </h4><br>  The process of normalization, if some stages are not taken into account (But consider the results of these stages!), Is the usual ‚Äúsplitting‚Äù of tables into smaller tables with the creation of a relational connection between them directly or through intermediate tables (a ‚Äúmany to many‚Äù connection).  Relational relation can not always be understood as a relational relation! <br><br>  Converting a dynamic or static reference to a static-dynamic reference, and a reference-bundle into a bundle, just like a static-dynamic reference guide into a reference bundle, is nothing more than splitting tables.  That is, converting one type of table to another through the above classification in order to avoid data redundancy - this is how normalization can be defined (one of the definitions). <br><br>  For example.  Suppose there is a database in which the only data modification operation is an add.  In this case, it becomes ineffective every time when a particular attribute of an entity is changed, to ‚Äúcopy‚Äù the other attribute values ‚Äã‚Äãinto a different tuple.  In this case, NULL or the creation of a static-dynamic directory is used, where a number of attributes of one semantics or one attribute is described, and only the foreign key with the primary key of the sequence is duplicated.  The same method can be used in the traditional data modification scheme with updating and deleting data. <br><br><h3>  Conclusion </h3><br>  This classification was created by me on the basis of observations in the design of databases, as well as on the basis of the read theory on the design in relational DBMS.  To my friends and acquaintances who study the ‚Äúdatabase‚Äù discipline and engaged in database design, and to me this classification has rather seriously simplified ‚Äúlife‚Äù and allowed in many situations to choose the most suitable and, as it turned out later, the correct type of table for storing in it or other data. <br><br>  The classification can be extended by splitting the existing species in it into subspecies (perhaps even adding new species).  This classification also showed that in some situations it is better not to use one or another kind of tables.  Some types of tables from this classification are best used less frequently (dynamic references).  And some try to replace with others (reference-bundles for bundles). <br><br>  I hope that no one else will help this classification in mastering the discipline "Databases" and in designing databases in relational DBMS. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/250177/">https://habr.com/ru/post/250177/</a></p>
