Because the book is about connecting two very related areas - these are flexible development methodologies (aka Agile) and configuration management (aka SCM). <br><br>  This book is about the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0470746637">Adapting Configuration Management for Agile Teams: Balancing Sustainability and Speed</a> by Mario Moreira (Mario E. Moreira).  The name can be translated as " <b>Application of SCM in teams with flexible development methods: in balance between stability and speed</b> ."  What is in Russian, that in English is equally cumbersome, but the meaning is clear. <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/088/fb0/1f3/088fb01f3d9ebfe799a546a8db7496fa.jpg" alt="Cover"></a> <br>  Before reading, he was afraid that the book would look like the heroes of an old joke about a guinea pig, but the fears were in vain.  And about Agile, and about SCM there - in full. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In the first chapter of <b>Introduction: Racing with Confidence, the</b> author says in advance - who should even read this book.  As expected, you can read everything.  And for those who are familiar with agile, but want to learn more about SCM, and vice versa.

      Next comes the basics of both SCM and agile.  <b>CM Primer</b> clearly explains what configuration management is, including version control, bug tracking, and tweaking control, and much more.  After this chapter there should be an understanding of what SCM is. <br><br>  The next chapter, <b>Agile Primer</b> , talks about what you have long wanted to know about Agile, but it was too busy to read.  I personally got for myself a hefty general picture of what Agile is.  Quoted Agile Manifesto, in detail all the provisions, basic practices, types of flexible techniques - including Scrum and XP.  Informative. <br><br>  Further, in the chapter <b>How CM and Agile Values ‚Äã‚ÄãWork Together</b> , the first attempt is made to bring together flexible techniques and SCM and show that they get along together perfectly and complement each other.  Then, the head of <b>Approaching Infrastructure for Agile</b> describes how infrastructure is built for agile development, and <b>Approaching the CM Implementation for Agile</b> prepares how SCM practices will be implemented. <br><br>  The most significant part of the book is the chapter <b>Adapting CM Practices for Agile</b> , which describes in detail how SCM practitioners can help the work of a team professing Agile.  Some side of the work of flexible methodologies is taken, and it shows how CM can help in working with it.  This includes continuous integration, test-driven development, pair programming and some other aspects. <br>  Next come the chapters <b>CM Tool as a Strategic Agile Partner</b> and <b>Evaluating Tools for Agile</b> , describing the choice of tools for both CM and the entire development process. <br><br>  The book is closed by a chapter provided by Bob Aiello - <b>using CM Standards and Frameworks for Support Agile</b> - which largely repeats the chapter of the same name <a href="http://scm-notes.blogspot.com/2010/12/configuration-management-best-practices.html">in his own book</a> . <br>  On the website of the publisher you can read a detailed <a href="http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470746637,descCd-tableOfContents.html">list of chapters and sections</a> . <br><br>  For developers professing Agile, it will be useful to once again look at what practices they use, and once again see if it is possible to somehow improve their work.  Surely there is something new. <br><br>  For those involved in SCM or any of its parties, it will also be useful to get acquainted with what almost half of the industry is now living in.  After all, Agile is now on the rise, which means you need to have a good idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat is happening around. <br><br>  The overall result - we must take. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/111222/">https://habr.com/ru/post/111222/</a></p>
