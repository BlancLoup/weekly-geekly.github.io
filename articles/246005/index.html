Using <br>  The internal controller offers many advantages, in particular: firmware over the air, saving <br>  on an external controller, reducing the number of soldering points ... <br>  I decided to split the material into two parts.  The first is preparation for work, programming and <br>  debugging  The second is creating your own BLE profile. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  1. Preparation for work.

      <br>
      To develop applications for the CC2541, the MUST HAV dial-up is: <br>  - <a href="http://www.ti.com/tool/cc-debugger%3FkeyMatch%3Dcc-debugger%26tisearch%3DSearch-EN">CC-debugger</a> - in-circuit debugger for 8051 TI chips; <br>  - <a href="http://www.ti.com/tool/cc2540keyfob-rd">CC2450 USB dongle</a> - in order to quickly and easily check the characteristics of BLE profiles on <br>  computer screen; <br>  - well, actually any board with a SS2541 chip. <br>  Ideally, these things are combined in the debugging kit from TI - <a href="https://store.ti.com/CC2541DK-MINI-CC2541-Mini-Development-Kit-P4349.aspx">CC2541 mini DK</a> .  I recommend to purchase. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2f0/967/f47/2f0967f47fd74348a91bc6a159806a53.jpg"><br><br>  From the software we need: <br><br>  - <a href="http://www.ti.com/tool/ble-stack%3FkeyMatch%3Dble%2520stack%25201.4%26tisearch%3DSearch-EN">actually BLE stack</a> ; <br>  - always have to be on hand: <a href="http://www.ti.com/tool/smartrftm-studio%3FkeyMatch%3DSmart%2520RF%2520Studio%26tisearch%3DSearch-EN">Smart RF Studio</a> , <a href="http://www.ti.com/tool/flash-programmer%3FkeyMatch%3DFlash%2520Programmer%26tisearch%3DSearch-EN">Flash Programmer</a> , <a href="http://www.ti.com/tool/packet-sniffer%3FkeyMatch%3Dpacket%2520sniffer%26tisearch%3DSearch-EN">Packet Sniffer</a> ; <br>  - for debugging: <a href="http://www.ti.com/lit/zip/swrc258">BLE device monitor</a> ; <br>  - <a href="http://www.iar.com/Products/IAR-Embedded-Workbench/8051/">IAR for 8051 controllers</a> in version from 8.2 (can be taken with a free 30-day <br>  license). <br><br>  Without unnecessary descriptions, go through the stack folders, which one way or another will be required for <br>  work. <br>  - accessorize - contains the BTool debugging utility, USB dongle drivers and compiled <br>  images of finished devices; <br>  - components - libraries (OS, peripherals and BLE); <br>  - documents - the folder creates the appearance of documentation for all components and modules; <br>  - projects - examples of projects. <br><br>  2. IAR IDE, debugging programs. <br><br>  Let's open for example the project SimpleBLEPerepherial.  We try to compile ... And I give 7 of 10 that <br>  The project will not meet.  The error occurs due to the fact that the linker cannot fit in memory <br>  specified number of virtual registers.  There are two options for solving the problem: <br><br>  - just reduce the number of virtual registers from 16 to 8, and do it for each <br>  project, hoping that he will meet; <br>  - fix the linker configuration file (in the simple case, this is ti_51ew_cc2540b.xcl).  In him <br>  need to: <br>  1) open this file (it lies in the \ Projects \ ble \ common \ cc2540 \ \ folder) in a text editor; <br>  2) find the string -Z (DATA) VREG + _NR_OF_VIRTUAL_REGISTERS = 08-7F; <br>  3) replace it with -Z (DATA) VREG = 08-7F; <br>  4) enjoy projects that will begin to gather. <br><br>  Having connected the debug board to CC-debugger, we will launch the application on it (Project-Download and <br>  Debug, Debug - Go). <br><br>  Now when you press the right button, the keyfob goes into Advertising mode, that is, to it <br>  can connect.  Stick in the USB dongle based on the CC2540.  We have two monitors for work. <br>  with this dongle: convenient BLE device monitor and hardcore BTool (the latter‚Äôs installer is <br>  complete with stack).  We use the BLE Device monitor. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ab6/c1f/19f/ab6c1f19f5714e3cbfbe233ad36bc2be.png"><br><br>  The most important fields in this window are: <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Handle</b> field - the ordinal number of the entry in the BLE device service table, <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Type</b> field - indicates the type of record (determines the service record, the characteristic of the service, <br>  the configuration of the characteristic or the characteristic itself (its UUID)), <br>  ‚Ä¢ well, the third important field is the <b>Value</b> field.  In the case of a definition record <br>  service this field actually says service UUID. <br>  Documented services are listed <a href="https://developer.bluetooth.org/gatt/services/Pages/ServicesHome.aspx">here</a> .  We, provided we are not members of the Bluetooth SIG, 16 <br>  bit addresses of services cannot be used.  Need to use 128-bit UUIDs.  But about that <br>  later. <br>  The Value field in the characteristic declaration record contains: <br>  -UUID characteristics (for example, <br>  0xFFF3 in the example), <br>  -number of entries in the device table (in other words, the handle is 0x002B in our <br>  case) <br>  -the order of access to the characteristic, determined by the bit mask (in the simplest <br>  case - 0x02 - read resolution, 0x08 - write resolution, 0x10 - alert resolution). <br><br>  In addition, it is important to learn from this screen that a user variable to read <br>  or entries are determined by three entries in the device table (definition of a characteristic, <br>  the value of the characteristic, the description of the characteristic - the first and second fields are required, the declaration of the third is the rule of good tone), and <br>  a variable that, when changing, notifies the application, in addition to this must have <br>  additional configuration feature that enables or disables notification. <br><br>  Packet Sniffer is also extremely useful for debugging.  I will not tell in detail <br>  I‚Äôll just say that to work with a packet sniffer, you will need to flash USB dongle firmware <br>  sniffer_fw_cc2540_usb.hex, lying somewhere in the depths of the sniffer installation folder (by the way, I sincerely hope that you will not have to debug applications at such a low level). <br><br>  This is how the iBeacon packages appear in the ether sniffer: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0cd/1b3/80d/0cd1b380d2ea47728e5125389de95558.png"><br><br>  3. The mechanism of functioning of the peripheral BLE device <br><br>  First, let's look at how the peripheral device works in the SimpleBlePerepherial example. <br>  The main logic of the program is concentrated in the file SimpleBLEPerepherial.c, while <br>  the main function is located in the SimpleBLEPerepherial_Main.c file, but it is usually governed by <br>  there is no sense, since the periphery and OSAL are initialized in it (some semblance of <br>  operating system).  Using the BLE stack, we access only the part of the processor <br>  time (with the lowest priority).  This determines, in particular, the programming style: <br>  a large number of callback functions, the lack of endless cycles in the body <br>  programs, the maximum use of interrupts ... <br><br>  The first user-defined function called by OSAL is the SimpleBLEPeripheral_Init function.  In it: <br>  - the parameters of the future connection are determined; - the parameters and composition of the data for advertising are determined; <br>  - the profiles supported by the device are registered, the Kelbacks of these <br>  profiles; <br>  -In OSAL, a message is displayed that the device is ready for operation. <br><br>  Next, it is important to pay attention to the Kelback caused by the stack, which defines the parameters <br>  connections, - peripheralStateNotificationCB.  The function always allows you to understand whether <br>  connection to the central device or not. <br><br>  Any actions (pin management, reading sensor readings, etc.) are strongly <br>  I recommend performing in a periodic task.  For this you need a function from the library <br>  OSAL - osal_start_timerEx (), which, in addition to the user task identifier, needs <br>  pass the time after which the system interrupt occurs, and the bit mask of the event, <br>  which when processed is handled in the SimpleBLEPeripheral_ProcessEvent () callback. <br><br>  4. Support OAD <br><br>  Now consider the function OAD - firmware update over the air.  Immediately, I note that <br>  This feature is only available in chips with a memory of 256 KB.  Maximum detail mechanism <br>  Creating applications for OAD is described in the <a href="http://processors.wiki.ti.com/images/8/82/OAD_for_CC254x.pdf">document</a> , but it‚Äôs worth a couple of points to clarify.  First, the memory on the chip <br>  allocated for two images of the program: the current (executable) and the area for the program, <br>  taken by air.  Secondly, a bootloader must be installed on the chip; <br>  which, when the device starts, will choose which of the images to launch. <br>  Let's try to create an application with the ability to update the firmware over the air.  First <br>  We will fix the chip with the bootloader firmware.  To do this, compile the BIM project, located <br>  in the \ Projects \ ble \ util \ BIM folder, and load the resulting image into the controller by <br>  Smart RF Flash Programmer (action Erase, Programm and Verify).  Next, collect the image with <br>  which our device will start: we will assemble the SimpleBLEPerepherial project in the configuration <br>  CC2541-OAD-ImgA (by the way, the memory markup file, which we corrected at the very beginning, <br>  in this assembly changed, so you have to make similar changes to the file <br>  cc254x_f256_imgA.xcl).  Get this image via Smart RF Flash Programmer (Append and <br>  Verify), at this step, the most important thing is not to erase the pre-boot bootloader.  Now by rebooting <br>  chip and connect to it via BLE device monitor, we will see support for OAD. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/227/090/6a1/2270906a18a94aa6a78360a077e1de74.png"><br><br>  Now we compile the image for loading over the air and load it onto the chip.  To start <br>  compile CC2541-OAD-ImgB configuration.  Next in the BLE Device Monitor, go to <br>  tab File-programm.  Make sure the chip works on image ‚ÄúA‚Äù, select the .bin file in the folder <br>  ‚ÄúImgB‚Äù configuration output files and update the firmware. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4c5/ae7/8e1/4c5ae78e14294690a45a8602dec02236.png"><br>  We will reload the chip, reconnect and make sure that the chip works with the ‚ÄúB‚Äù image. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c2b/2f3/d97/c2b2f3d977104333bc806d5ffac35916.png"><br><br>  Therefore, the firmware has been updated and a new version has been launched.  Now it is possible to allocate more memory for one of the sectors, but this is a completely different story ... <br><br>  This is all about the stack.  In the next part create your custom BLE profile.  I hope that the article will be useful for starting work with CC2541. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/246005/">https://habr.com/ru/post/246005/</a></p>
