But he likes not only to ride such electric cars, but also to know how they work.  Jason is a fairly famous person in the Tesla fan community.  For example, it was he who managed to extract some data about the new model of electric car from the updated car firmware.  More specifically, we are talking about the detection of the ‚ÄúP100D‚Äù entry in Tesla 7.1 firmware.

      But now he managed much more.  He was able to get the Tesla Model S rear-wheel drive, and learned how to drive it.  Where does the drive come from Hughes does not say, but it is not so important.  More importantly, he was able to gain complete control over all the functions of this site. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/ranK9OHb9IY%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500000,15700019,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiL44fh2hRaoBFCWwwQSSp0OAn2sw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The first step in this challenging project was to energize the drive while simultaneously sniffing the CAN bus to detect individual control commands.  It took about 12 hours, but in the end it was possible to make the motor turn.  The master had to tinker - not only did the engine work data have to be deciphered, but Jason wrote special software to control his work.  At this stage, it was only about making the engine work.  It took him another 3 hours to intercept and decrypt the CAN commands. <br><br>  After that, things got easier ‚Äî Hughes managed to find a complete set of control commands.  for example, he was able to connect the water cooling system, and put it into operation while the drive was running (in a certain mode of operation, the system claimed speeds of 188 kilometers per hour. The engine was able to be put into power generation mode. Energy recovery system introduced by Tesla engineers It allows the engine to be used as a generator during braking. Now James can, at his discretion, set <a href="http://insideevs.com/salvaged-tesla-model-s-rear-drive-unit-spun-bench-videos/">various parameters</a> for the engine's power supply and energy generation. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/5LRBG1W8vBY%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500000,15700019,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhgrr6grkOKcXL8bZDVaKIYNI03vg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  As a result, he even managed to create his own rear-wheel drive control board.  Interestingly, the engine was removed from a car with firmware 7.1, which included a number of safety schemes that prevent interference with the normal operation of the system.  But Jason managed to get around these obstacles. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/D3K3S0fiSJs%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500000,15700019,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhg0A8lgGeb0VsDb_eb4fmamRrj-_A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The most difficult task was to get the engine to obey the commands of the self-made controller, but even this turned out to be handy for the craftsman.  According to him, he collected his fee literally out of the garbage.  In order to secure the engine, the master used relatively low amperage.  This is not the first case of the ‚Äúhack‚Äù of the Tesla Model S engine. 11 months earlier, another craftsman, Jack Ricardo, also managed to get the electric motor to obey the commands of the controller of his own invention.  But here we are talking about using only the engine and controller. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/zMQjcukphpA%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500000,15700019,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhh9ikIMqItR0B3ekJo8nmyBzWHYsA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  It is worth remembering that the <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/275516/">updated</a> Tesla Model S electric car <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/275516/">model</a> comes with a 70 kWh battery, which actually has a capacity of 75 kWh, but part of the battery, if you can put it that way, is locked in software.  The company sold these cars for a month, and only now it became known.  How can the owner of such a machine get 5 extra kWh?  Very simple - pay $ 3250 for the "unlock". <br><br>  The upgrade process is completely software, and is done "by air".  The company's employees need physical access to the car only in order to change the Tesla Model S 70 badge to the Tesla Model S 75 badge (done at the service center).  The company's idea is simple, albeit a bit strange, to allow Tesla Model S 70 buyers to pay less by $ 3000 than Tesla Model S 75 buyers. Moreover, the hardware for both models is exactly the same.  The company reasoned that not everyone needs an increased battery capacity, and those who do not need it were allowed to pay less.  The difference in the distance that both models can travel offline is about 35 km. <br><br>  By the way, not so long ago, special software was released for the same Tesla Model S, which allows the driver to control the <a href="http://www.motors.co.uk/news/general/tesla-model-s-summoned-by-mind-control/">car with the help of</a> "power of thought".  Mentally commands can make the car go a little forward or reverse gear.  In this case, the reading of the signals of the electrical activity of the brain is made using a special helmet.  The signals are analyzed by a special program, after which they are transmitted to the on-board computer for driving. <br><br>  Well, if you do not have the money for Tesla, you can <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/274771/">build your own</a> electric vehicle based on the Dacia Logan.  Another craftsman, Mark Areni, took as a basis the low-cost model of the car, Dacia Logan 2005 release.  The total cost of the project (together with the car - the basis) was $ 13,000. <br><br>  The author of the idea got rid of all the details related to the internal combustion engine and fuel in general, and replaced all this with batteries, an electric motor and the corresponding elements.  The author of the project says that there are not many chips inherent in Tesla electric vehicles (such as a large touchscreen display) in his car.  But this electric car can travel about 160 kilometers without recharging (the price of travel will be $ 1.8).  The battery is fully charged in six hours. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/395009/">https://habr.com/ru/post/395009/</a></p>
