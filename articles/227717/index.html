This approach to this channel has arisen for several reasons.  First of all, it‚Äôs not so much the metrics that are important to us as the well-being and mood of the user.  Secondly, email marketing affects a huge number of factors: sales, awareness, as well as user loyalty, which is very important for us as a customer-oriented company. <br><br>  What does grocery email marketing mean?  Let's go through all aspects together, without going into the standard details.  We will share our experiences and real tasty cases about the most interesting.  So let's go!

    <h1>  Our approach </h1><br>  Usually email-mailing is perceived by the user as something intrusive and annoying.  This happens because the letters are more often of an informational nature - product news, promotion dates, hot offers.  However, we managed to add value to the letters.  We understood what problems the user had and solved them, with the result that there was a demand for our newsletter.  Let's look at the three main problems that arise for our users. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  The global problem of motivation </h4><br>  Leo knows that the most difficult thing in learning a language is to find motivation in yourself.  This is very similar to buying a card in a fitness club.  You spend a large amount of money, plan to study hard six, or maybe even eight times a week, master all simulators and attend all group classes.  But at the end of the year it turns out that a couple of visits for all the time - is the result.  What happens to the original installation?  Why is motivation lost?  Let's see. <br><br>  The whole team deals with the problem of motivation.  At the same time, we use the available resources and, of course, e-mail marketing as one of the most effective channels of communication with the user.  In order to remind of unfinished activities, we make trigger mailings and unique themed special projects that cause the user interest and desire to visit, save or help Leo again.  For example, a call to go through a word training to get Leo back to his meatballs, or a game - flying over lunar craters in an attempt to save Leo from aliens. <br><br>  In addition, we noticed that users themselves can support each other's motivation by communicating in the savannah.  Clients receive notifications about new messages by mail and, thus, make for us a part of e-mail marketing: we are good, and people are pleased to talk and help each other. <br><br><h4>  Difficulties in working with the site </h4><br>  The new visitor feels somewhat insecure when they first met the service.  At the same time, an experienced user may experience light discomfort from studying pages with unusual promotions.  In such cases, LinguaLeo customers can count on standard technical support and the Leo assistant, as well as e-mail marketing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/18a/4c7/8f0/18a4c78f051f05838d065d24989c8c24.png"><br><br>  The latter actively helps newcomers: as part of the welcome letter, they receive a ‚Äúcourse for a young fighter‚Äù, and later - reminders and thematic newsletters about the release of products. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/74f/5f1/134/74f5f11347e1dc58b23705a4bdd1f658.png"><br><br>  For customers who have purchased the gold status, we have a couple of autoresponders, reminiscent of the end of the subscription period for 5 and 1 day.  This, of course, simplifies the purchase path, and disabling paid functionality does not come as a surprise to the user. <br><br><h4>  The problem of time and isolating the necessary information </h4><br>  LinguaLeo service is aimed at active people who know how to save their time.  Our task is to very briefly state the most important information and provide quick access to it.  How do we do it?  Let's give an example.  For a long time we had a weekly newsletter ‚ÄúLessons from Leo‚Äù, containing various grammatical rules and links to thematic content.  Having saved all the letters that came from LinguaLeo with lessons in one folder in the mail, users could at any time start studying in one of the courses.  This accelerated the process of finding the right data by the client and maintained interest in the resource.  As a result, we received a good response: some users wrote very warm reviews with gratitude.  Despite the fact that the newsletter was only supposed to return the user to the site and did not think about how to sell, it consistently increased the daily earnings.  A good product that quickly solves the user's problem is bought with pleasure. <br><br><h1>  Beautiful packaging </h1><br>  A product aimed at the mass market gets more attention from consumers if it looks nice and concise.  Creating a new product or developing an old one, it is always important to remember about the interface.  You are testing, introducing new features, and all this with only one purpose - to get into the user's heart.  Given the specifics of e-mail marketing, the steps should be as follows: to interest, make it so that the client is comfortable, make yourself remember.  A newsletter is a marketing channel, and its task is to lure, to offer something "catchy."  And you need to do this with a certain amount of UX-comfort, that is, using mechanics such as user experience, ease of navigation and an obvious message (call). <br><br>  The letter interface is ‚Äúpackaging‚Äù, directly affecting sales, and this applies not only to design.  Marketers, and not only them, know that most subscribers will not read large text with the rules of English.  Therefore, when creating an e-mail layout and filling it, remember that ‚Äúbrevity is the sister of talent‚Äù.  Do not forget about the main goal - to cause interest in the user, so that he subsequently read your newsletter.  A good solution would be to show a small piece of useful information in the letter.  We, in particular, write about the use of words with several meanings in different situations.  It becomes curious to the subscriber, and on such examples he begins to understand why it is necessary to be engaged in grammar.  Two problems are solved in this way: returning the user to classes and explaining the value of studying courses to him. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/efd/c19/5f8/efdc195f8e2c652ec948b87bed462b1c.png"><br><br>  Nota Bene Before you think about the contents of our ‚Äúpackage‚Äù, you need to remember an important detail: the letter and landing should be connected.  The idea is not new, but building a user's path and exploring a funnel is really very important.  The segment can be chosen not for reasons of activity on the site, but by age, sex.  The active user will understand the mechanism of the action, but the beginner is likely to think before the action.  At the same time, it is not necessary to expect that an experienced user himself will look for the meaning of your sentence.  Make the chain simple and understandable for everyone. <br><br><h1>  Correct format </h1><br>  We remember that the main purpose of grocery e-mail marketing is to solve a user's problem.  At the same time, this should be done imperceptibly, so as not to scare him away.  Hence the question: in what format to submit information?  You can make different assumptions on this subject, but we decided to run an experiment. <br><br>  Consider the real situation.  We called this case "The <b>best selling e-mail</b> ". <br><br>  April at Lingualeo was rich in various promotions.  Each of them was unique, as it used different mechanics and differently motivated the audience to act or purchase.  As mentioned earlier, all promo for subscribed customers began with an intriguing letter.  A story appeared in it, the end of which the user found on the landing page.  Therefore, we value a couple of "letter and promo" is inextricably, as a whole. <br><br>  Let us analyze two mailings, which were made on the eve of the shares on April 12 and 23. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1f9/859/b4d/1f9859b4d0eeba6d0e2552b10716431f.png"><br><br>  In a letter on April 12, Leo participated.  Intrigue was present: the person who opened the letter did not know what was waiting for him when clicking on the link.  At the same time, experienced service users understood that LinguaLeo is waiting for them either with a discount or a game. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fca/32d/4f8/fca32d4f874f3ba0e00dde09b4c7069a.png"><br><br>  On April 23, mailing recipients were offered a simple test.  At the same time, the addressees felt they were involved in a mass action that was limited in time. <br><br>  <b>The results of the mailings were as follows.</b>  The first letter worked worse than the second several times.  It turned out that the user-friendly and easy-to-understand mechanics of involvement, combined with the ability to pass the test, are enjoyed by a much larger number of people. <br><br>  So, the format of your product is determined only by you, but you should try it out in advance on several clients and leave only those characteristics to which they respond best. <br><br><h1>  Small summary </h1><br>  Let's call theses the conclusions to which we walked for so long: <br><br><ul><li>  Treat the e-mail newsletter as a product, and it will open up new opportunities for you to promote your product. </li><li>  Solve the problems of your client before his contact with your product or service. </li><li>  Make a convenient and intriguing writing interface. </li><li>  Link letters to the landing page. </li><li>  Analyze the results of mailing, compare them with each other to find the best solutions. </li></ul><br><br>  Thank you for reading us.
