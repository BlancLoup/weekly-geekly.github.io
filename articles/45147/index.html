  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Down with the language barrier!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I want to tell you about one muddy idea of ‚Äã‚Äãan Internet project.  Why muddy?  Because this is the rare case when <b>I am not sure that the idea is working in principle</b> .  But it seems to me very interesting, and most importantly - useful. <br><img src="http://www.newscool.ru/farvater/fest06-3.jpg" alt="Down with the language barrier"><br><h4>  Foreword </h4><br>  So, today, on the Internet, social networks and other web 2.0-style projects are very popular.  All these services allow users <b>to communicate with each other</b> .  However, any communication is limited by the language barrier.  <b>I can not talk to the Chinese</b> , just because I do not know Chinese.  <b>I can't get to know a French woman</b> , just because I don‚Äôt even know how to start a conversation in French, but she doesn‚Äôt understand Russian.  I <b>can't write a letter to a German author</b> whose book I recently read.  Although the author of the book is ready for dialogue, he indicated his e-mail in the preface, noting ‚Äúif you have any questions about the book, write‚Äù.  But how to write if <b>there is a language barrier between me and him</b> ? <br><br><h4>  What to do? </h4><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Of course, in this case, you can use the services of translation agencies.  <b>But!</b>  <b>It is not comfortable.</b>  After all, first I have to write a letter in my native language, then send it to the translator.  Then, having received the answer from him, copy and send to the very Chinese or French.  Then, having received the answer I have to re-do the whole procedure.  And so many, many times, as a result, I am losing time, but I would like the communication to take place in real time (or be close to it, that is, transfers take place in a matter of minutes).  <b>Definitely need an online service.</b> <br><br>  <b>If you describe the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthis service in three words, it will look like this: the sender - the translator - the recipient.</b> 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      In fact, such a service can be tied to anything.  Whether it‚Äôs a blog service, a dating site, a social network or anything else, it doesn't matter.  Well, for example, let's assume that we are talking about <b>international e-mail</b> .  So, for the sender and the recipient, everything should be transparent.  The sender sends the letter as usual, but the difference is that it does not immediately go to the recipient, but first to the translator. <br><br><h4>  And who exactly is our translator? </h4><br>  Here are 2 options.  Either these are various translation agencies around the world with which contracts have been concluded.  Or, resource users who know foreign languages.  This means that I can register on the site as a translator and earn money by translating other people's phrases.  Of course, such translators need to be checked for professional suitability, but you understand, this whole thing is a technique. <br><br>  And then the translator enters the site and sees a list of phrases that need to be translated.  Moreover, the status of untranslated texts changes in ril time (a translation is needed, a translation is being made, already translated).  It is clear that thousands of translators should work here, so everything should be organized as comfortably as possible, and there should be no time delays.  In fact, this scheme is suitable: thousands of performers are sitting on the site at the same time (as in freelancing, for example), the text comes in, who first took it and does it.  Moreover, the performer must meet the specific time, which depends on the number of characters. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  By the way, I decided to conduct an experiment and sent a proposal for cooperation on this project to large translation bureaus in Moscow.  Now I get answers.  If you are interested, I can then describe what answers I managed to get, how much the capital bureaus are interested in cooperation, how this project should look from the point of view of the translator and the client, how it can be implemented with less losses.  Just talk about other features of this muddy project.  <b>If you are interested, of course.</b> <b><br></b> <br>  If someone wants to implement an idea, do not be lazy to <b>write about it to me</b> .  I both hands for such projects to appear in the network, so I am ready to give you some specific tips and ideas on this topic.  If anyone has other suggestions, do not hesitate too! <br><br>  <b>UPD</b> Read the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/startup/45208/">second part</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/45147/">https://habr.com/ru/post/45147/</a></p>
