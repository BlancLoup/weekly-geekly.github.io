Two important things at once: <br><br><ol><li>  We are able to spread only board games, and not the fact that our principles will suit someone else. </li><li>  The layout is far from what to start working with the store, it usually gives a 1-5% increase in revenues.

    <h2>  Novelty magic </h2><br>  You go to the store, and there on the shelf a game looks at you, tied with a white rubber band across.  This is not a game fund, where all the games have already been played, this is a shop demo.  Gum there because sellers do so with open boxes so that they do not fall apart - or the components will be lost.  Gum on the game = non-commodity view. <br><br>  Non-stock view is valid only in the sales box for markdowns. <br><br>  A person entering the store is waiting for something neat and a little magical.  If this magic is broken, then the desire to buy will immediately evaporate.  We have repeatedly observed how just one of every detail, starting from dust on the edge of a shelf or with an inaccurate broom behind the cash register, dramatically changes the store's figures. <br><br>  A person reads all such signals very quickly. <br><br>  But this does not mean that open games have no place in the store.  They are needed for demonstration.  Therefore, we keep open games behind closed, second layer.  It is necessary - we quickly get and show.  When the game goes into a state of "slightly worn", it falls into the sale box or in the game fund.  Sometimes we have contracts with suppliers for demo samples: we give back the lost ones in exchange for new ones.  Suppliers use their worn games for their games or give them to orphanages. <br><br>  Why is magic so important?  Here Valery Firstov once published one of the first Moscow glossy magazines about interior - ‚ÄúSalon‚Äù.  So, they began to pack it in polyethylene.  And then they did it, as far as I know, only with the category of 18+.  Sales have grown: people saw that the magazine is new, no one has read it yet.  Therefore, by the way, any of our games in the box are larger than the palm - always in film or closed on a plastic seal (in the case of soft bags).  It's damn important for people to know that they bought a really untouched thing. <br><br>  A counterexample - there is an excellent holivar quiz " <a href="https://www.mosigra.ru/Face/Show/bitva_polov/">Battle of the Sexes</a> ".  It costs 800 rubles per box, which you are waiting for 1000-1200 rubles.  Inside a bunch of shaggy cards of strange paper, the box itself as from under the shoes.  No heat shrinking, decks are tightened with rubber bands.  It‚Äôs scary to give: even a new one looks as if it has already been played for generations.  I have already bought five boxes, they often work with disposable quizzes for a company in some distant city, and then they don‚Äôt crawl into the aircraft‚Äôs carry-on baggage.  But back to the calculation. <br><br><h2>  More chaos god of chaos! </h2><br>  Here the games are after buyers are not exactly on the edge, but scattered along the shelf.  All this needs to be returned to a beautiful rate as before the photo report for the central office.  Not because there is a perfectionist in the central office (although it is), but because there will be more sales.  At the same time, it is important not to go to the other extreme - I saw somehow how the elder millimeter-millimeter spread everything in the shelf, so that it was scary to get the game. <br><br>  If there is no affordans such as a small slot showing that the game can be taken in hand, they will not watch it.  Aerobatics, watched by the Germans - is a turn to a small angle, so that the goods "hang" from the shelf a little bit.  But it is very difficult to maintain in order. <br><br>  These slits are: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/al/xi/8a/alxi8a3qdnpvg73qo8remgoq3aa.jpeg"><br><br>  Here is the same regiment in another report: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gf/gf/lx/gfgflx_hnuv3kkosyqvg_jhnl4w.jpeg"><br><br>  In the second picture as a whole, everything is fine.  But our perfectionist from the Central Organ is confused by the ‚Äúdarkness‚Äù in the middle.  Even in the corner is a " <a href="https://www.mosigra.ru/Face/Show/startup/">Startup</a> " - a small light box.  It should be at least four - two in front and two in the second layer.  Bought?  We remove from this place, it creates a hole in the display, as if the store had few goods.  In general, there is nothing worse than a hole - the shelves must break from the games.  This directly affects sales. <br><br>  At the same test, a recommendation emerged: keep the petanque (a game with large metal-stone balls) open in the display.  This is the other side - some products are better to get and show.  Heavy steel balls made of petan, of course, directly entice people to whistle them, but still these are not figurines, and it is difficult to imperceptibly to conceal them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/3c/ic/44/3cic44ihpy3pukv7fabkmicocoa.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>This is the complete chaos of our version:</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/5r/sg/-7/5rsg-7nhc5cqz7e6a1ofiamgdbq.jpeg"><br><br>  In the corner there are two plastic bags (this is a transport package), wooden constructors should be placed lying (back vertically) so that they can be examined.  In general, in the bottom row now the goods are also laid out, but it is worth using it as a drive. <br><br>  At the same point, the recommendation is to collect all the games for small children for 3 years in one side of the rack.  The request is very specific, the games are objectively 20 pieces in large boxes, so this is very useful when consulting.  Why - because during the consultation it will not be necessary to run around and not to drag the games from different places.  Otherwise, the customer may decide that you are frantically searching for what to give - and this, from experience, creates the impression that there is not much good in the store.  Well, the consultation is usually just no pause for the search. <br><br><h2>  Accents </h2><br>  On this shelf you need LED tape (two pieces): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/5o/fg/px/5ofgpxqvfeymewqsu0lvpojludi.jpeg"><br><br>  Because there (on the middle), there are excellent open desktops, they directly ask for it in their hands.  But it's dark and scary. <br><br><h2>  Furniture </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/06/vo/w-/06vow-_ro7ccmfbbthdoodyicoo.jpeg"><br><br>  See these islands here?  Furniture demarcates shop areas.  9 out of 10 buyers in Russia go to the right branch of the round (counterclockwise).  If it is not there or it is cluttered up - minus the conversion.  Islands of furniture or tables help to understand what and how.  And immediately show the game. <br><br>  On the islands (mini-racks) there should be either soft toys, or pyramids of games, games of the week.  On the tables - open games, promotional games.  In this case, the calculation error is that the end does not work.  There you can stick posters, but it is better to lay out the goods there. <br><br><h2>  General principles </h2><br>  The display is divided into modules.  For example, ‚ÄúCheckpoint Zone‚Äù, ‚ÄúToys and Designers‚Äù, ‚ÄúChildren's shelving‚Äù, ‚ÄúGeek shelving‚Äù and so on.  Each zone has a size - small, medium or large.  The small includes mandatory system requirements, the large includes what can be put if the places are still dofig. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ie/kz/q5/iekzq5b6g71myk9duxv71ohwkl8.png"><br><br>  Intra store navigation (which is for customers) corresponds to the planogram display objects.  A planogram with detailing before the game is done once at the opening, after which general calculation algorithms are set that the seller can execute and check by the administrator. <br><br>  What if the racks do not fit?  Suffer.  Now the equipment is selected at the opening, and it should correspond to the peculiarities of our calculations.  Specifically, to be with mobile shelves (to customize the height of the shelves for the goods), with individual racks and with nets or economy panels for small goods: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ml/2k/ng/ml2kngujv8hwpkbmonwnj92gbac.jpeg"><br><br>  When installing commercial equipment should not forget about the possibility of theft of goods from the store.  Therefore, it is not necessary to have shelves for small goods near the exit, it is better to install them next to the cash registers (we have cash desks almost always in the back of the store from the entrance).  Although they steal purposefully from us rarely, it must be admitted.  But it is better not to enter into temptation. <br><br>  At the moment we use vertical and combined display, which means that goods of one category are displayed on one rack.  There are standard rules for calculations (hot zone at the hands and eyes, etc., I have already <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/mosigra/blog/307256/">told</a> you about this for a long time). <br><br>  All products need to be exhibited "face" on the buyer, the end face exhibited only products of group C, and provided the store is full.  Do not do this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cw/0f/u0/cw0fu06k_65l49ena2svdb4r1ck.jpeg"><br><br>  In general, the cascade layout with respect to the frontal one is like two completely different frameworks.  We had a couple of cases of retraining of existing teams for frontal display: at first this is a terrible mental abuse, because everything seems different.  You need to think a lot about the need of the goods.  Everything and immediately fit into place will not work, so it will be necessary to think of the main and secondary.  And this requires mathematics and a certain ability to sacrifice.  Understand that you just need to put everything at once in front, and then people themselves will understand that in a new way it is more beautiful and more convenient for the client. <br><br>  But back to the rules.  All products of group C must be located on the upper or lower shelves of the store.  At the same time, a large-sized goods or goods with high weight are displayed on the lower shelves. <br><br>  It is important not to mix products from different categories.  When the product is presented in one category, it is easier for the seller and buyer to navigate.  In the sense that you can take the buyer to the corner with the games he needs and show everything there. <br><br>  Here is a side A from the planograms of Taganka.  This is the most viewed area, board games are exhibited here. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/4g/gv/a9/4ggva9ggt4abyzneflz9xpz8ru0.jpeg"><br><br>  Since the rack with shelves A1-A4 is located in the very corner, respectively, some games are not very well viewed, there are large-sized, also games of group B and C. On the shelves with shelves A5-A11 are logical games, A12-A16 - games for parties , A17-A21 - games for a couple.  Next is a rack with a different arrangement of shelves.  Here are the top positions, A22-A26 - parties, A27-A31 - Monopolies, A32-A36 - strategies.  The next rack is full with children's games. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/f5/4l/pz/f54lpzw1gqjvf8uvnhq1anocspk.jpeg"><br><br>  This is a side B sweep, here are 3 shelves full of toys.  Closer to the front door, we placed a larger product - radio-controlled cars.  B1-B5 - designers and products for kids, B6-B11 - dolls and interactive animals, B12-B18 - experiments, robots, B18-B23 - transformers and other toys. <br><br>  We filled all free spaces of the walls with nets or economic panels in order to fill them with smaller goods, thereby unloading the main shelves. <br><br>  Here such retailing XLS-files change between themselves: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/38/lf/ro/38lfro57hnr2wsl_odnco1knxqs.png"><br><br>  Here you can see the display of the goods by the tower without a rack or storage: this is done when there are actually a lot of goods.  And it helps sales a lot.  But specifically here I would have kicked the top box, otherwise people would be afraid to disassemble this tower: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rb/pe/as/rbpeasqtt7mmjxfkv32cudiu668.jpeg"><br><br>  To calculate such planogram as on the screen, you need to know the speed of sales of each game and its value in the range - this <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/mosigra/blog/427133/">model of</a> ABC / XYZ analysis is also included. <br><br>  In the end, all this is decorated - different photos, gift wrapping on the shelves and so on.  Here, for example, Taganka acquired buttons last week (each store has its own view on the correct gift wrapping, and Taganskaya after the new year was incredibly taught to make bows, and they evolved): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zr/ri/yu/zrriyugauufet1o3pggvghybwgk.jpeg"><br><br>  A checkout box is laid out separately, there are requirements for the product and materials right away, for example, this sign should never be blocked: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fu/cv/vk/fucvvkjhxf6b9o4o_vswx4_ckde.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mk/ff/oq/mkffoqm5a4scgholokn-ihuuvcq.jpeg"><br><br>  Below you can see large copies of boxes of different games: they are where the hands do not reach, but attract attention.  This is a 2018 experiment.  And successful.  By the way, they sometimes try to buy them, so now we just made stickers: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pv/ym/hp/pvymhpya5swfjkvnb_do13tndrk.png"><br><br>  It will also be glued to the box-demo (without content), which are suspended from the ceiling, for example.  They are sometimes brought by suppliers for shop windows.  In order not to confuse. <br><br>  In general, I do not know why you need it, but I hope it has become a little clearer. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/445524/">https://habr.com/ru/post/445524/</a></p>
