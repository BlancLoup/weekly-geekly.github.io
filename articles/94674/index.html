  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Our memory is everything!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h4>  Our memory is everything! </h4><br>  I think it‚Äôs no secret that memory is everything for a person.  Everything that we did, we do, and we want to do - everything is stored in memory, and without it, everything would become impossible.  And if our memory is bad, then we are doing everything very badly.  And my memory is not the best, and it constantly affects my life. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Remember% username%. </h4><br>  You have had such that you are driving for example in a minibus, are busy with your thoughts, think about something, and suddenly, bang!  It dawned on you.  I got an idea for a startup, or as I have more often, articles.  And now you are eating, carefully cherishing and considering your idea, trying to create a plan, thinking how to present all this, and suddenly distract you.  No matter why, they asked for the money to be transferred, or the mobile phone rang, you switch to the current task, complete it, and again plunge into your thoughts.  You come home, and you seem to remember that it was a cool idea, but which one - do not remember.  And you are torturing yourself, trying to remember what it was connected with, what you thought of before, and perhaps hardly remember it.  And maybe you do not remember, and then you are very angry with yourself, with your girlish memory. <br>  Well, such situations happened to me often, and I was pretty tired of it.  Many times I wanted to practice my memory, but as usual, I forgot the next day.  It was not so once, and I firmly decided to train my memory, or, alternatively, to expand its real possibilities for the better. <br><br><h4>  And the memory is not rubber. </h4><br>  I started with the simplest thing that came to my mind - I began to memorize mobile phone numbers by heart.  Having suffered a lot, I did not succeed, only my head got sick from memorizing.  Realizing that the power of my maiden memory is not correct, I decided to go around.

    <h4>  If the mountain does not go ... </h4><br>  So, I realized that without a weapon I couldn‚Äôt win myself.  Well, well, it is said - done!  The next day I probably do my best deed for the year - I buy a children's notebook.  Yes, the most ordinary notebook for records, 10x10.  Oh yes, it was a good day in truth!  From that day on, I had a new rule - always put a notebook in my pocket, wherever I went.  Maybe it looks stupid when I‚Äôm at the dentist‚Äôs office, with frantic movements I take out a notebook and start recording something in it, but then I Remember!  A month later, I already had about five notebooks, in different covers, in a cell, ruler, large and small.  I wrote down everything that interested me in any way.  Website address, ideas, thoughts, even sudden rhymes, and those became stuffing for my notebook.  After a while, such global ‚Äúforgetting‚Äù as it disappeared, because I was constantly looking at my notebook when I came home.  And often found there very interesting things. <br><br><h4>  Training. </h4><br>  In addition to recordings, I advise you to constantly train your memory.  Yes, yes, as I found out from my own experience, training is the main thing.  It is important that your memory constantly keeps in itself some kind of active information, thereby stimulating itself.  I used many different options, I memorized phones, memorized names and surnames, I even memorized the numbers of cars passing by.  But it was all wrong.  The brain itself struggled with me, because he understood that he didn‚Äôt give up the number of this car, this is unnecessary information, garbage, which he safely cleaned.  The brain needs food for thought, something that would be useful and you yourself understood it. <br>  My mother suggested me the right option.  Poems.  Oh yes, the most ordinary poems, but not all in a row, but only those that you really like after the first reading.  So I learned that I love Blok, Pushkin, Esenin.  Just now in my arsenal there were also collections of poems, the benefit of the book are sold in a very different format.  I have a collection of poems of Blok, the size of which is only 10x10, and no more than half a centimeter thick.  Learning poetry was not only useful for memory, but also for self-education.  It was very nice, sitting in front of a fire in a country house with friends to recite Blok's Voice ‚Äúin the clouds‚Äù, or something else sonorous. <br>  But there is an alternative way.  I think every second IT person knows at least one foreign language, and the rest part wants to learn.  Well, so I was burdened only with the school package of knowledge of the English language.  Oh, how nice it is, to learn almost the entire table of irregular verbs in three incomplete days.  For a couple of weeks, I expanded my vocabulary three times, and without memorizing, but simply reading foreign news, simultaneously translating them using a paper dictionary.  Yes, it is not learning at night, but simple calm reading. <br><br><h4>  results </h4><br>  Well what can I say, yes, I achieved the goal.  I surprise my acquaintances when they dictate their cell phone to me, and I just remember it.  Anyway, learning has become even easier.  Already I do not write notes, the basic information is acquired by hearing from the teacher.  Morality spills over into a couple of lines, in principle, that is what I wanted to describe in my article, I did not expect it to turn out that much. <br><ul><li>  Make it a habit to write down all valuable thoughts, and even those thoughts that so far don't seem valuable to you, too, write them down. </li><li>  Constantly work on yourself, just remember, learn something new, but constantly check yourself, thereby stimulating your memory. </li><li>  Read.  This not only develops memory, but also thinking and enhances your level of education. </li></ul><br>  In general, that's all, I apologize that the article came out so cumbersome, and so little was placed in it.  Apparently, this is the only way I can write articles, sorry =) <br>  Thank you very much for your time, I hope the information will be useful and not intrusive.  Goodbye. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/94674/">https://habr.com/ru/post/94674/</a></p>
