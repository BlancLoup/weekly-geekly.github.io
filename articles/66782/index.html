No, to be the best is the opportunity of every normal person!  And you, Habrozhitel, also have this opportunity! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I always thought that any person can achieve excellent results if he sets such a goal and will persistently go to it.  And recently I heard about a great book by Jeff Colvin called ‚ÄúOutstanding Results.  Talent has nothing to do with it! ‚Äù(Talent is Overrated: Whats Really Separates World-Class Performers from Everybody Else), which confirmed my point of view. <br><br><h4>  The essence of the book </h4><br><br>  The essence is clear from the title: the book says that the most ordinary person can achieve outstanding results, but many people have natural questions: How?  Why?

      According to the author, talent does not have a major impact on a person‚Äôs success in a given area, success depends on a person‚Äôs efforts.  There is nothing easier than to point a finger at a successful person and say: "He has a special talent, I can not do that."  In fact, this successful man worked long and hard to become so. <br><br>  A simple example: what will happen if a child at an early age, say up to 12 years old, starts talking about economics, its structure, laws (of course, available, with simple examples)?  After that, until 15, to talk about business and its device, to give to read business literature?  And then send him to practice as an assistant manager?  Such a person by the age of 20 will understand business no worse than business consultants and will be called a ‚Äúgenius‚Äù, but in reality this is just hard work. <br><br>  The author says that there is no evidence of special talent among people like Warren Buffet, Bill Gates and others.  Great success is ensured by hard work and the so-called "conscious practice". <br><br><h4>  Monstrous experiment </h4><br><br>  One Hungarian psychologist conducted an unusual experiment that clearly does not fit into the framework of morality. <br><br>  He studied the life of successful people and came to the conclusion that their success is due to a great concentration on the goal and a long, hard work.  Accordingly, successful people can be grown. <br><br>  For the experiment, he found a woman, they made 3 children, who from childhood began to teach the game of chess (the result can be easily calculated in the opinion of the father). <br><br>  All 3 children as a result became brilliant chess players. <br><br><h4>  5 rules </h4><br><br>  Jeff Colvin derived the magic formula for how to become successful in any field: <br><br>  1. Improving the quality of work <br>  You have to constantly think about what you are doing poorly and work on it. <br><br>  2. Repetition of actions <br>  ‚ÄúRepetition is the mother of stuttering‚Äù is not about us.  Any action must be repeated many times in order for it to be remembered.  By the way, here you can recall the study of memory, the result of which a simple action is remembered for a long time after 7 repetitions, for 7 days. <br><br>  3. Determine the result <br>  You should clearly know what you want to come to, so that after you know the criteria for improving the result. <br><br>  4. Concentration <br>  For good results, deep concentration at work is needed, about 4-5 hours a day to work out and improve results. <br><br>  5. Perseverance <br>  For great achievements need more perseverance.  I know on my own - from time to time there is a desire to quit everything and relax, sometimes it even reaches depression, but in no case should this be done. <br><br>  For the young: do not doubt in your abilities, the author himself says ‚Äúdown with age‚Äù! <br><br>  From myself I will add: develop memory.  There are many different exercises, for example, the ‚ÄúCubes‚Äù exercise: you need to buy 10 game bones of the same shape and color, take a few, to begin with, shake in your hands, put on the table, raise your palm for a couple of seconds, cover again and give all the numbers fell out.  The number of cubes is gradually increased, and the time of the raised palm is reduced.  Exercise to do every day for 15 minutes.  Memory in a month will improve significantly.  This exercise is widely practiced by chess players. <br><br>  <b>The result:</b> if you want to achieve something, everything is in your hands.  The book is a must-read for those who really want to become a first-class professional. <br><br>  <b>upd:</b> thanks for the karma :) <br>  <b>Author:</b> <br>  Nikita Semenov ( <a href="https://www.facebook.com/semenov.nikita.andreevich">Facebook</a> , <a href="http://vk.com/simferopol">VK</a> , <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/nikitasemenov">LinkedIn</a> ) <br>  CEO <br>  <a href="http://secl.com.ua/">SECL GROUP / Internet Sales Technologies</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/66782/">https://habr.com/ru/post/66782/</a></p>
