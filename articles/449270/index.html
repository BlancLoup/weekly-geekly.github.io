  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Yandex has published an overview of the IT job market</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In February 2019, Yandex launched the Practicum - a service for online training of future developers, analysts and other IT specialists.  In order to decide which courses to do first of all, our colleagues studied the market together with the HeadHunter analytical service.  We took the data they used - descriptions of more than 300 thousand IT vacancies in millionaire cities for 2016‚Äì2018 - and prepared an overview of the market as a whole. <br><br>  How the demand for specialists of different profiles is changing, what skills they should have in the first place, in which areas the share of vacancies for beginners is highest, what salary they can count on - all this can be learned from the review.  Those who want to master the profession in the field of IT should be useful. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gx/lp/t1/gxlpt1ehmyni4no9mm240zgagda.jpeg">

    <a name="habracut"></a><h2>  Overall market </h2><br>  The demand for IT professionals is growing; over the past two years, the share of job ads for them from all ads on HeadHunter has increased by 5.5%.  The share of open positions for specialists without experience in 2018 was 9% of all IT vacancies on the market, in two years it grew by almost a third.  Those who succeed in gaining a foothold in the profession, in a year pass into the group that accounts for most of the vacancies: more than half of all announcements in the market are addressed to specialists with work experience from one to three years. <br><br><img width="600" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mt/em/zm/mtemzmjqcaiyoe9qhfw3xforxmi.png"><br><br>  In the whole country, the median salary of an IT specialist last year was 92,000 rubles.  Salary of a novice specialist - 46 000 rubles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cg/h2/jd/cgh2jdnkuw8m0w9csd0paoakf2o.png"><br><br>  In more than half of the cases, employers do not indicate the amount of remuneration.  However, in all considered sections (by cities, required experience, specialties) there is a sufficient number of vacancies with declared salaries, which allows conclusions to be drawn about the level of wages in the market as a whole. <br><br><h2>  Regional features </h2><br>  Most of all IT vacancies, of course, in Moscow and St. Petersburg - for 2018, local employers published 95 thousand ads, 70% of the total number of ads in large cities.  If we weigh the number of IT vacancies on the size of the local labor market, Novosibirsk will turn out to be the most ‚ÄúIT-friendly‚Äù Russian city: last year, about 72 vacancies related to IT accounted for a thousand job advertisements.  Moscow and Petersburg occupy the second and third places. <br><br>  The fastest growing demand for IT professionals in Perm: compared to 2016, the share of IT jobs in the local market increased by 15%, to 45 per thousand.  In second place in terms of growth - Moscow, in third - Krasnodar. <br><br>  The salary level and the vacancy rate for beginning specialists differ noticeably from city to city.  Most of all pay in Moscow and Petersburg.  And the percentage of open positions for beginners in capitals, on the contrary, is lower than in any other millionaire city. <br><br>  <b>Salaries and requirements for work experience in big cities</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xm/e5/qz/xme5qz-22pebyk4ocpaolf2hdwc.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mh/jq/tz/mhjqtzzfl3d5sjicdxq9prmhjg8.png"><br><br><h2>  Work in foreign companies </h2><br>  Russian IT specialists are hired not only by domestic, but also by foreign companies.  The median salary in the announcements of such vacancies is much higher - more than 220,000 rubles.  However, the requirements for applicants are higher: the share of beginners accounts for only 3.5% of such vacancies, 24% - for specialists with work experience from one to three years, but the main part of the proposals is addressed to employees with more than four years of experience. <br><br><h2>  Working conditions </h2><br>  The work of a programmer in a large Russian city is most often office and regular.  Basically, companies are looking for full-time employees - for a standard five-day week or a shift schedule with a normalized day.  A flexible schedule was offered only in 8.5% of ads published last year, remote work - at 9%. <br><br>  They are usually looking for more experienced employees: more than half of these vacancies are accounted for by specialists with experience from four years.  The share of vacancies for beginners is almost two times lower than in IT as a whole: less than 5%. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8o/nb/tb/8onbtbmatj-4qo0l3ggmnp-hgcu.png"><br><br><h2>  Specialty </h2><br>  There are many specialties in the IT market.  For this study, we identified the fifteen most requested and studied only them.  Making up the top, we focused on the headlines of ads, that is, on how employers themselves formulate who they are looking for.  Strictly speaking, these are not top specialties, but top names of open positions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yj/51/p3/yj51p3a0vqhibr-mw7bebclayxo.png"><br><br>  For the period studied, the demand for IT professionals as a whole has increased, but this is not true for all professions.  For example, although Java and PHP developers remain among the most sought-after in the market, demand for them over the past two years has fallen by 13% and 21%, respectively.  The share of announcements about the employment of iOS developers fell by 17%, the share of vacancies for those writing for Android also decreased, but not so much, by less than 3%. <br><br>  On the other specialists demand, on the contrary, is growing.  So, the demand for DevOps compared to 2016 increased by 70%.  The share of vacancies for full-developer developers has doubled, for data science specialists - more than two.  However, by the number of vacancies, these specialties occupy the last lines in the top-15. <br><br>  Front-end development stands out against the general background: there are more vacancies for these specialists than anyone else in IT, and the demand for them is only increasing - in two years it has grown by 19.5%. <br><br>  <b>Salaries and requirements for work experience in various specialties</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/w7/xs/g_/w7xsg_gswymdofyqr8eb7vezp2a.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gm/h2/iy/gmh2iy59jlivqopjujslfyiue78.png"><br><br>  Beginners are more likely to be taken to data science (data analysis or machine learning): the share of vacancies for candidates with less than a year's experience here is a quarter higher than in the market as a whole.  Next comes PHP development and testing.  The lowest part (less than 5%) is the vacancy rate for newcomers in full-stack development and 1C. <br><br>  The highest level of salary offered in 2018 was among Java and Android developers, in both specialties the median is above 130,000 rubles.  Next come DevOps engineers and iOS developers with a median above 120,000 rubles.  Among novice specialists, iOS developers could count on the largest reward: in half of the ads they were promised more than 69,000 rubles.  In second place are specialists in C ++ (66,100 rubles), in third place - full stack developers (63,200 rubles). <br><br>  Among the skills that employers often indicate as key, over the past two years, the demand for possession of the front-end Reactor library has grown the most.  Interest in specialists able to work with tools for the backend - Node.js, Spring and Django has noticeably increased.  Of the programming languages, Python added the most - it was mentioned among the key skills one and a half times more often. <br><br>  To get a portrait of a representative of each of the specialties, we studied job descriptions and identified a list of skills that employers most often indicate among the key ones.  In addition to the most frequent, they highlighted the skills for which the demand began to grow noticeably during the past year.  In the screenshot below - the resulting portrait of the front-end developer.
