  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The results of the poll "How would you like to see Toster.ru?"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello everyone from the Toaster team!  While working on improving our service, we are constantly studying web analytics data, collecting feedback from users through the support service or through the questions asked <a href="https://toster.ru/tag/toster.ru/questions">by the ‚ÄúToster.ru‚Äù tag</a> .  And when we need to make a more difficult decision or deeper understand the behavior and preferences of users, we conduct surveys.  Today we just want to share with you the results of one of the surveys that we conducted recently. <br><br>  We asked users about some of the principal innovations that we plan to introduce in the service, and also asked to compare Toster.ru and Stackoverflow.com for a number of parameters.  More than 2.5 thousand people took part in the survey, of which two thirds are developers (moreover, 39% have the Senior or Lead qualification level, 38% - Middle, and 23% - Junior or Intern). <br><br> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/toster/blog/338196/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8af/7ae/c9b/8af7aec9b1913f1fb715bc88acdbf455.png"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  New features toaster </h2><br>  Let's start with innovations.  Sometimes the old-timers of the ‚ÄúToaster‚Äù reproach the service for asking too many basic questions and regularly asking them to divide them by difficulty.  We included this problem in our survey and obtained the following results. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

On the other hand, only every sixth person does not like this idea. <br><br>  Taking this opportunity, we proposed several options for dividing questions by difficulty: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/19c/57b/133/19c57b133e996b448c1ae22617825e55.png"><br><br>  With a small margin won the option of dividing issues by difficulty from Intern to Senior.  That is, in the same style in which it is customary to divide the developers themselves now by their qualifications. <br><br>  The results of the survey convinced us that it was necessary to divide the questions according to complexity.  We hope that very soon you will be able to see the embodiment of this idea on the ‚ÄúToaster‚Äù. <br><br><hr><br>  Moving on.  The next request, often voiced by users, is to give a negative rating to questions, answers and comments.  Through the survey, we decided to find out how much this function is needed by a wide range of users: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ff8/743/c28/ff8743c28f2623f854103db1ab249184.png"><br><br>  As we see, opinions are divided here: the majority voted ‚Äúin favor‚Äù of the introduction of such functionality, but every third person opposes. <br><br>  So what about the introduction of negative marks, we still think carefully.  For a start, let's see - suddenly, the introduction of the separation of questions by complexity will eliminate the desire to minus? <br><br><hr><br>  In the survey, we also decided to find out whether users are ready for the fact that it will be possible to ‚Äúraise‚Äù the question and fix it on the first page of the issue, as well as whether they are ready to pay for it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/777/64a/99f/77764a99f4a177c6ec7e776c1a7997a0.png"><br><br>  Opinions were divided approximately equally: a third was ready for such an opportunity, and a third reacted negatively to such an idea.  Approximately also voices shared when answering the question about the willingness to pay for it themselves. <br><br>  Again, we see a rather large share of dissenters, which means that we must also think about this functionality and communicate better about what can be bad in this opportunity (and what is good). <br><br><hr><br>  Then we asked if the users would like to see on the Toaster competition questions with a cash prize, which would receive the one whose answer was the first to be recognized as a solution? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7af/1fd/3ce/7af1fd3ce7e741a7958fccbbbb1bc85b.png"><br><br>  Here, users were more unanimous: more than half met this idea warmly, only every fifth person did not like this idea. <br><br>  Developing the topic of competitive questions, we asked further those who like this idea, are they ready to give answers in such questions?  The vast majority were ready! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/382/583/6a3/3825836a384d0107afb6475529996110.png"><br><br>  But when we clarified with the next question from them, and whether they are ready to create such questions themselves and spend real money to reward the respondent, we see that far from everything is already ready: however, almost 40% are ready! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8f9/c59/86b/8f9c5986befb69a6d8151e62e56b72e0.png"><br><br>  In principle, a similar mechanism has already been implemented on Stackoverflow, but with the only difference that rating points, not money, act as a reward, we wanted to go a little further. <br><br><hr><br><h2>  Integration of "Toaster" with other services TM </h2><br>  We are constantly thinking about how to increase the integration between the Toaster and other TM resources.  We also constantly hear about this from users.  In the survey, we decided to clarify this point in more specific and tangible forms.  And received the following answers: <br><br><ul><li>  67% of respondents would like to be able to get a full account on Habrahabr for their activity on the "Toaster"; <br></li><li>  56% agreed that for proper activity on the ‚ÄúToaster‚Äù it would be nice to get the opportunity to use the Freelance service for free: to place orders or respond to them; <br></li><li>  46% agreed that it is cool to be able not only to help people find solutions, but also, as a bonus, to post vacancies on My Circle for free! <br></li><li>  No more than 10% spoke out against such possible bonuses. <br></li></ul><br>  We will not fully open the veil of secrecy over the future of the ‚ÄúToaster‚Äù, however, we want to note that your opinion helped us a lot to correct the vector of further development of the project. <br><br><hr><br><h2>  Toaster and StackOverflow </h2><br>  Since we are often compared with Stackoverflow, we decided not to miss the opportunity and asked the users what are the advantages of ‚ÄúToaster‚Äù over Stackoverflow and vice versa, what are the advantages of Stackoverflow over ‚ÄúToaster‚Äù? <br><br>  The majority (about 40%) believe that asking a question or giving an answer is equally simple (difficult) on both resources.  The opinion of the remaining divided so that twice as many respondents believe that it is easier to ask a question or give an answer to the "Toaster".  But the Stackoverflow audience is considered more friendly than on the Toaster. <br><br>  The question of the advantages of "Toaster" and StackOverflow, we left open, giving the opportunity to self-wording.  We will not give all the answers here, because there are so many of them (and thank you for that!), But the top most popular answers look like this: <br><br>  <b>The main advantages of the "Toaster":</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Russian language <br></li><li>  More pleasant interface <br></li><li>  Ability to create discussion questions <br></li><li>  Broader topics <br></li><li>  You can view all questions. <br></li><li>  Localization (specific software like 1C) <br></li><li>  Newsletter digest (this surprised us) <br></li><li>  Low entry threshold <br></li></ul><br>  <b>The main advantages of SO:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  More difficult questions <br></li></ul><br><ul><li>  Large audience <br></li><li>  More ready solutions <br></li><li>  No discussion <br></li><li>  The best moderation <br></li><li>  English speaking community <br></li></ul><br>  We by no means strive to make the second StackOverflow out of the Toaster, but from the answers we saw that our service has its convincing advantages that we will develop and maintain further.  First of all, we will continue to try to create a place where IT-specialists will be able to get answers to a variety of questions relating to their activities: both simple and complex;  both having an unambiguous solution, and affecting a broader discussion issues or exchange of experience. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/338196/">https://habr.com/ru/post/338196/</a></p>
