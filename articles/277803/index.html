Introduction </h4><br><br>  This is a book of chapters and others.  Alan Kay, who needs about 15-20 interim Dynabooks systems for his education research.  Alto has a lot of broader scope, suggest, however.  I‚Äôm going to begin by outlining the characteristics, and then go on.  Every CSL research program. <br><br><h4>  2. Characteristics </h4><br><br>  An Alto system consists of <br>  48-64K 16-bit words of memory (plus parity and perhaps error correction). <br><br>  A 10 megabyte Diablo disk drive? <br><br>  A 901 TV line monitor.  It is vertically oriented, and it is designed to be driven from a bit map in the memory.  It takes 32k (825x620) raster.  These dots are about 1.4 mils square.  It can be reduced to 1 mil, which gives an 825x860 raster and 44.3K of memory.  The square raster can display 8000 5x7 characters with descenders or 2500 beautiful proportionally-spaced characters. <br><br>  Undecoded keyboard pointing device. <br><br>  For example, Lisp, Bcpl, MPS, or whatever. <br><br>  A high-bandwidth (10 MHz) communication interface is not yet specified. <br><br>  Optionally, a doug clark fixed-font character generator  It adds a raster, but adds no rule of thumb, new capability.  It should cost about $ 500. <br><br>  Optionally, a Diablo printer, XGP, or other hardcopy device. <br><br>  A table is about 45 "wide and 25". <br><br>  Most importantly, it can be reduced to $ 9.7K by the use of a 2.5 megabyte disk.  The cost is not equal among disk, memory, and everything else.  We have spent about 1974 CSL member. <br><br>  PDP-10 can do.  Than a time-shared 10, even if the latter is lightly loaded (excepting: lots of floating-point computation).  Furthermore, we have the Lisp, Bcpl, and MPS systems.  If you‚Äôre on your own? <br><br>  There is no power of computing power.  It will be a problem;  a Bcpl seems like feasible, but has not been investigated. <br><br>  A 64K Alto has as many Lisp cells as 32K of PDP-l0 memory.  BBN claims page 25k working interval and 30 ms page fault interval.  If you‚Äôre on track, it‚Äôs 32 ms for the 10's drum tracks.  Hence, if I‚Äôm not counting the 10 for Lisp programs, I‚Äôm not counting the speed limit.  It is highly plausible to use it in a 32K swap space.  Comparable results can be expected for other languages. <br><br><h4>  3. Applications </h4><br><br>  This is a list of the last sections: <br><br>  Alto is more powerful than a VTS terminal connected to Tenex; <br><br>  If you should prove desirable. <br><br>  a) Distributed computing.  Aloha-like point-to-point packet of the network between the Alto's network,  We can then do a large variety of experiments with dozens of machines.  It is easy to understand.  In particular, it‚Äôs not a problem. <br><br>  b) Office systems.  Peter's Lisp-based NLS competitor or the xNLS system.  It will not be a problem to optimize the system.  This information is obtained from the multi-user xNLS experiments.  It may also be possible to escape from Nova dependency;  this possibility requires further investigation. <br><br>  c) Personal computing.  If your phone doesn‚Äôt have any personal computers, it‚Äôs correct to convincingly on Alto.  If they are wrong, we can find out why.  We should, for example, be able to satisfy users such as Warren and Peter with an Alto.  This would also take a bit of a heavy computing load away from Maxc.  It is also possible to validate your personal computer (eg, different memory hierarchies).  It is important that the memory system is more compact. <br><br>  d) Graphics.  It is a frivolous pattern.  It can't do dick shoup's stuff. <br><br><h4>  4. Competition </h4><br><br>  Alto competes with SSL are doing.  I think this is a good thing, since it wants to excel.  Specifically; <br><br>  a) VTS can be used to control the video switch.  It is not possible to control the systems of shared-resource systems.  And of course, it‚Äôs a computer that uses it. <br><br>  b) it can be better.  It can be used for such large systems as well. <br><br>  c) which can be replaced by Altos.  Those who like the Vova Nova, are secure. <br><br>  d) The implications of the local network are unclear. <br><br>  e) Imlacs are wiped out. <br><br>  [ <a href="http://www.digibarn.com/friends/butler-lampson/index.html">Source</a> ] <br></div></div><br><br><h5>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_P._Thacker">Charles Tecker</a> </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/094/bb3/fa2/094bb3fa221c4af48e3113e5cac309ee.jpg" align="right">  Together with Butler Lampson and other alumni, he founded the company Berkeley Computer Corporation, in which he developed computer electronics.

On the Alto keyboard, there was no underline key, which was adapted for the left arrow symbol, which was used in the Mesa language as an assignment operator.  This feature of the Alto keyboard could have caused the CamelCase ID naming style.  Another feature of Alto was the ability for the user to program the processor microcode directly. <br><br>  Despite the relatively small amount of RAM, for Xerox Alto, programs with graphic menus, icons, and other elements that became familiar only with the advent of Mac OS and Microsoft Windows operating systems were developed and used. <br><br><ul><li>  Bravo and Gypsy - the first WYSIWYG word processors </li><li>  Laurel and Hardy - network E-mail clients </li><li>  Markup and Draw - graphic editors (bitmap editors) </li><li>  Neptune - file manager </li><li>  FTP and chat utilities </li><li>  Games - Chess, Pinball, Alto Trek game by Gene Ball </li><li>  Sil - vector graphics editor for integrated circuits and printed circuit boards. </li><li>  Officetalk experimental forms-processing system </li><li>  Programming Languages ‚Äã‚Äã- BCPL, LISP, Smalltalk, Mesa, and Poplar </li></ul><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Some pictures / screenshots of software</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/824/9c5/4de/8249c54dec5a86e4a59b135181deb324.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Smalltalk <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f83/2e4/c3d/f832e4c3dc350319900c39c64e033889.gif" alt="image"><br>  Bravo <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6f9/2e0/f90/6f92e0f9084575b8b4bfd554a74aa933.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Cedar <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/33b/276/697/33b2766979a815d4e7fcfe59f8ab0e5c.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Markup <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/283/78d/d8c/28378dd8ccb02b4da70849f67200ab85.gif" alt="image"><br>  Draw <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d71/be9/5be/d71be95bea169099f00652fce654a660.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Sil <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7b6/a6a/63b/7b6a6a63b4a5b30554415b8ab79743e9.gif" alt="image"><br>  Laurel <br>  [ <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/blampson/38-AltoSoftware/WebPage.html">source</a> ] <br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">more screenshots of programs</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/197/8b6/21d/1978b621d8638bd014d769c14711d271.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Display from the keyboard-test program: <br>  If you‚Äôd like to make it, you can‚Äôt be pressed simultaneously.

The Xerox Alto: A Personal Retrospective <br><br>  <b>Conclusion</b> <br><blockquote>  <i>‚ÄúDo not doubt that a small group of thinking and selfless people can change the world.</i>  <i>In fact, it is only they who introduce these changes. ‚Äù</i> Margaret Mead </blockquote><br>  In my opinion, it is incredibly cool to be a witness (and even more so a participant) of creating new and interesting things.  I was lucky to be close to a group of young and daring people who created ‚ÄúDial‚Äù (the first anti-cafe), although not an IT product, but still very driving and cool.  I talked a bit with the developers of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybiko">Cybiko</a> , they have a lot of interesting stories.

Why did you think ‚Äúcomputer‚Äù, ‚Äúnetwork‚Äù, ‚Äúhypertext‚Äù, ‚Äúintelligence amplifiers‚Äù, ‚Äúcollective problem solving system‚Äù, what meaning did they put into these concepts, what tools they wanted to achieve a result. <br><br>  I hope that these materials will serve as an inspiration for those who are wondering how to go <a href="https://megamozg.ru/post/2408/">‚Äúfrom Zero to Unit‚Äù</a> (to create something that had never happened before).  I would like IT and ‚Äúprogramming‚Äù to stop being just ‚Äúcoding for the sake of dough‚Äù, and recall that they were conceived as a lever to change the <s>methods of warfare,</s> education, a way of working together, thinking and communication, as an attempt to solve world problems and answer facing humanity.
