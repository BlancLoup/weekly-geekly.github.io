  <section class="page js-page"><h1>CardInfo - API for determining the logo, bank colors and other things by card number</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wf/km/mr/wfkmmryrfjtj6xv27bfxqjhysjo.png"><br><br>  Here is the demo and documentation: <a href="https://cardinfo.online/">cardinfo.online</a> This is the API.  You give him the first 6 digits of a bank card, it gives you a link to the bank‚Äôs logo, its corporate colors, brand (Visa, MasterCard, etc.) and so on in JSON format.  CardInfo is needed for those who create a form for accepting bank cards on their website in order to improve the UX (convenience, experience, sense of security) of users.  Accepting payments directly on your site allows <a href="https://cloudpayments.ru/">cloudpayments.ru</a> in Russia and the CIS countries, and <a href="https://stripe.com/">stripe.com</a> throughout the rest of the world. <br><br>  All major companies have made such forms.  You can see a live example when paying for anything via Yandex.Cass or practically in any mobile application of the bank: when you start entering the card number, the form is repainted in the colors of this bank, and the logo appears next to it.  Each of these large companies has implemented its own solution for determining the logo and colors.  If this solution was implemented by all large companies, then there is value in it.  If the large ones have already done, but the small ones have not yet, then it looks like an uptrend, which is reasonable to ride. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      However, large companies have long made their forms so, but small ones still do not.  Why?  Creating such a solution for your form will take about 7 days of work by the programmer and 7 more works of the designer (pump out, process and redraw logos).  Large companies can afford to spend on creating such a form.  Small companies believe the value of this form is not sufficient to pay so much for it. <br><br>  CardInfo will allow you to turn an already existing form for accepting bank cards into the same one as Yandex.Cash, for a half-day programmer.  I suppose that after the release of CardInfo, the definition of the bank logo and bank colors for payment forms will become the standard.  Because such forms are better.  Because now such forms will be able to afford everything. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  And by the way, notice that all the coolest accept payments right on your site, and not sent to external gaskets.  For example Dodo Pizza <a href="https://dodopizza.ru/">dodopizza.ru</a> <br><br>  In general, accepting cards right on your site is cool, but it's even cooler to accept cards on your site through forms made with CardInfo. <br><br><h2>  Price policy </h2><br>  Well, generally free.  Thanks to our business skills for that.  The API works the same for any user and works on the front.  Accordingly, even if you introduce any restrictions on the use of the free version of the API, you can simply copy someone else's paid key and ready.  So we did not become wise, left free.  Stuck is useful, so be it. <br><br>  There is a hypothesis that it will be wrong for someone to use an API, to which no guarantees are given because it is free.  To those people, we are ready to sell the entire database and logos so that they can implement this solution on their side.  Who cares, write. <br><br>  We will also be happy to sell the project entirely to someone whose brand he can raise in the eyes of his users.  For example, with pleasure we will sell to CloudPayments. <br><br>  If someone in the community has ideas, how else can this be monetized, or how to give development to the project, we will be glad to see your ideas in the comments. <br><br><h2>  About Us </h2><br>  In general, we are engaged in product development: we design, prototype, develop.  In our entire history, there were 2 subscriber customers, for which we made large multi-user web services, which I did not say for whom, because it is impossible.  Now we are thinking what to do, I want to do something that is obviously useful.  If for some reason someone needs, write, offer.  It is interesting to collaborate with a team that has some non-market advantages, but just problems with the development. <br><br>  Our team, JSBND, does not have any special representation in the network.  But JSBND is part of Union-1 (a group of organizations formed around the activities of Sergei Odin and his friends).  The main office <a href="https://vk.com/s0uz1">is</a> in the VC. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/453672/">https://habr.com/ru/post/453672/</a></p>
