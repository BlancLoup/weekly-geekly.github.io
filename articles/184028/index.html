      Phones penetrated into the offices of companies and permanently (forever, probably?) Stuck in them, becoming an absolutely necessary and familiar necessary accessory.  Over the past hundred years, they, one might say, have not changed at all, because how not to consider a change in size and the acquisition of a pleasant roundness.  And the rest are the same two holes: the first is where to talk, the second is where to listen from. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b4a/725/551/b4a7255514454b6166ec165974b4a5b3.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/821/912/476/821912476eea8dc1248990032ec833c6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Along with the rapid introduction of telephone companies into the office life of the phone companies, an attempt was made to introduce voice recorders into offices as well.  The attempt, as you understand, is unsuccessful: if voice recorders are used in modern business life, it is somehow sluggish and occasional, not like telephones. <br><br>  And the idea was promising!  It would seem so awesome: while the secretary makes coffee or is on maternity leave (the <i>first joke</i> ), the boss doesn‚Äôt waste time and writes a business letter on the recorder. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/60d/d7e/10a/60dd7e10aa7255691ecdbf1d94fba390.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Then the boss drinks the coffee, and the secretary who has returned from the decree sits at a typewriter, assorting the authorities' intonations coming to her through the clutter. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/172/6a3/ac8/1726a3ac84055d15b8272acc80ffb23d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Civilization, damn it! <br><br>  Everything was done according to the mind: and the advertising campaign was carried out, and the models of office voice recorders were designed, quite a miniature one.  Is it difficult, perhaps, to put such an amazing device on the desk? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/937/14d/444/93714d444b59bc36c52f0ac88fbb5566.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  What is difficult, it seemed?  It has five kilograms of weight, not more. <br><br>  But of course, the secretary will have to put, on his secretary's desk, a device for listening.  Because the device for recording is one device, and the device for listening is a completely different device, however as miniature as the first. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6d6/dec/652/6d6dec65295e1976295aad339c9530a2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Awesome, just awesome was the idea to fill the offices with voice recorders ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8d6/a64/ca7/8d6a64ca7555810158ad71185a2bee85.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It did not happen, however.  If with phones it went off with a bang, then it did not work with voice recorders.  Probably due to the fact that no dictaphone can replace personal communication with the secretary ( <i>second joke</i> ). <br><br>  Sound recording turned out to be in demand - even as claimed!  - but not in offices, but in the music business and on radio, in cinema and on television.  And the offices got ... well, except that the answering machines, now sunk into oblivion almost. <br><br>  The summary will be as follows: in scientific and technical progress you never know where you will find, and where you will lose, and where you will eventually get lost.  Man invents, but the fate of the inventions made by him - at the same time of all mankind - is decided by someone else (the <i>third joke</i> ). <br><br>  Relax, gentlemen habravchane, and breathe into the tube. <br></div></div></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/184028/">https://habr.com/ru/post/184028/</a></p>
