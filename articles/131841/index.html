  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What can really give specialized software for marketing?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In Russia, automation systems MRM (Marketing Resource Management) are just beginning their development.  BrandMaker is one of the first specialized MRM developers to enter the Russian market.  If not the very first. <br><br>  But being the first is not as good as it may seem - after all, we are dealing with a market in which there is still no clear and stable demand for MRM.  He is, this demand.  And business process automation technologies are applied with might and main to Russian companies, including marketing-related processes.  Just until there is a clear understanding that there are ready-made specialized platforms for marketing automation.  And also, what exactly to demand from such specialized software, what criteria of efficiency should be presented to it. <br><br>  Let's try to identify the key criteria in this short review.  Very interesting opinion on this issue habrovchan-practitioners - those who directly participated in the deployment of any automation systems of business processes, be it ERP, CRM, and the like.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  So, <br><br>  <b>A matter of time: using software to free up temporary resources</b> <b><br></b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/e5117788/5a1140bc/3a42ad97/075744d8.jpg"><br><br>  Automation of marketing based on information technology, as well as, for example, automation of accounting, is made with the main goal - increasing productivity.  The software should replace the manual work previously performed by employees of the marketing department, and release resources that can be directed to other tasks. <br><br>  A detailed examination of the processes of marketing planning can be found that they consist of a set of interacting processes.  Each stage requires related results, coordination of projects, analysis of plans, approval of interim reports, etc.  If we consider these processes within a large company, where several teams carry out their own marketing planning, then these ‚Äúaccompanying costs‚Äù will soon multiply, as the plans of all departments must be coordinated, combined, adjusted, etc. <br><br>  All these tasks are not related to the content part.  Yes, they are necessary for successful marketing planning, but they daily take too much time from the marketing department staff. <br><br>  <b>Question of quality: the software does not allow human errors</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/23dfcc1a/a26d4845/fb089252/f3e8c1bc.jpg"><br><br>  In addition to saving time, the use of information technology in the process of marketing planning will guarantee the quality of daily work.  It will eliminate human errors that can be easily made when collecting data from various sources. <br>  Marketing software based on a centralized database that contains planning data for all departments can, with one click of a button, provide the necessary files that you would otherwise have to diligently collect manually and convert to the appropriate format.  The marketing system does not lose a single thread, does not allow typos and does not delete important files by mistake. <br><br>  <b>Investment Question: The Keyword "ROMI"</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/0f478f35/1bfad6ce/0f905ecb/d964ccf2.jpg"><br><br>  ROMI - the ratio of profits to marketing investments, has become a key factor in evaluating the work of marketing departments, and its value is growing.  Numerical indicators determine how successful and effective the company's marketing activities are in order to achieve the most targeted and efficient use of available resources. <br><br>  In the MRM-system, the effectiveness of marketing activities, expressed in the profit on marketing investments, can be assessed almost in real time using the appropriate software.  Existing data is processed automatically and expressed in numerical terms.  Employees can see how their ideas and concepts work at the touch of a button. <br><br>  <b>Specialization Question: What Should Be Considered?</b> <br><br>  Depending on the supplier, marketing planning software solutions have different goals and areas of use.  For example, there is software that is aimed at such segments of individual marketing, such as managing direct advertising companies or customizing print media resources using Web-to-Print technologies.  As a rule, such systems concern only the planning processes in these segments.  There are also more comprehensive solutions where planning tools support all marketing operations. <br>  Some systems operate independently within the company, others allow flexible integration of various user groups. <br><br>  Today there are hardly any applications that require installing software on an employee‚Äôs computer.  Nowadays, most systems are based on web access (and integrated into the company's internal network) and have access via an Internet browser.  In this case, the variability of marketing software plays an important role in many companies.  Usually we are talking about the possibility of expanding the system, adding communications with external sources, etc. <br><br>  <b>And finally, the issue of usability.</b> <br><br>  Convenience programs in use also plays an important role.  Requirements for IT systems for employees of marketing departments are different from those that apply, for example, for accounting.  This factor should also be taken into account when choosing software, so that the tools not only increase efficiency, but are also well received by direct users - employees of marketing departments. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/968f9e27/4ad5bf5b/dfce0d4a/081902c3.jpg"><br><br>  Thanks for attention. <br><br>  I repeat - the opinion of people with real experience in this market is very interesting.  What moments do you think need to supplement the above list?  What nuances need to be considered specifically in the Russian market?  What systems are presented today in Russia suitable for marketing automation?  What are some marketing automation solutions that you already have in your company? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/131841/">https://habr.com/ru/post/131841/</a></p>
