But these programs, used in unlicensed mode, can lead to serious problems with the Criminal Code. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I note that due to the low prevalence of Macs on the territory of the Russian Federation, even despite the rapid growth of their population, the percentage of unlicensed software is used much less than on Windows.

      What is the reason for this? <br><br><h5>  Software out of the box </h5><br>  Traditionally, Apple provides its computers with a sufficient set of software so that you can buy a computer, personalize it and immediately start working on it (one of the commercials of the 'Get A Mac' advertising series is even devoted to this quality): <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZGg_0Y3K2pY&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhibPd_wYTRYzndwjS_3qgo8jtA_Zg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Out of the box on Macs the operating system itself and the three multimedia programs iPhoto, iMovie and GarageBand are preinstalled.  At least, the Macbook Air purchased at the beginning of 2013 was delivered with such a set of software. <br><br>  Thus, buying a Mac, you are at least a non-pirate, because the operating system is legal!  And even if you have an old Mac and you need to buy an operating system, you will lay out 649 r for Mountain Lion, compare it <hh user="http://1001-soft.ru/Microsoft_Windows_7.html">  with price tags on windows. <br><br><h5>  Mac App Store </h5><br>  In the wake of the success of iTunes Store and the App Store, on January 6, 2011, Apple opened its own online software store for Macs - the Mac App Store (MAS), which currently has more than 10,000 items.  If there is a corresponding desire, MAS is a convenient tool for the voluntary purchase of software for each day. <br><br>  In the App Store of my three Macs, authorized under my personal Apple iD, in the ‚ÄúShopping‚Äù section, I see the following picture: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/64c/890/7b3/64c8907b3f77bf2206db2f5a9a12eb22.jpg"><br><br>  In other words, it is allowed to install an <i>already purchased</i> software product on several authorized computers.  This is a feature of MAS, that purchased programs can be installed on several authorized computers, and this will not violate the licenses and rules for using programs (at least, for <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4854%3Fviewlocale%3Dru_RU">operating systems,</a> this is clearly indicated). <br><br>  Of course, in Windows systems the possibility is similar, but the clear advantage of Apple and MAS is the savings when installing the same programs on several Macs.  Of course, Apple does not block the ability to install the program under an account on unauthorized computers - this is the conscience of the owner of Apple ID. <br><br>  A similar situation - in similar software stores, for example, Steam.  Yes, with games for Mac is still fresh, but similarly - a game purchased under Steam-account can be installed on another computer (for three of my Macs this rule is also valid, cho). <br><br>  How else can you save when buying software for Mac? <br><br><blockquote>  I just want to drop the path of finding and using free software instead of commercial: for me personally, it may be harder to find an analogue program than to fork out for an N-number of banknotes. </blockquote><br>  On the other hand, some developers publishing programs in MAS have an interesting bzik: for example, CyberDuck I will explain the essence of the phenomenon. <br>  On the Mac App Store, this FTP client costs <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/cyberduck/id409222199%3Fmt%3D12">779 rubles.</a>  : <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/012/465/fcd/012465fcdffeed74c3da42a8e41e73b4.jpg"><br><br>  But from the <a href="http://cyberduck.ch/">official site, the</a> program can be downloaded and used for free: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9f3/955/6a9/9f39556a961828e1188989cb4ec6702b.jpg"><br><br>  Is that from time to time a duck will ask for it, but then, you know, you can adjust the amount of reward yourself. <br><br>  A similar example is <a href="http://code.google.com/p/movist/">Movist</a> (MAS, free) and <a href="http://www.netputing.com/handyprint/">handyPrint</a> (donationware). <br><br>  In the process of finding ways to acquire legal software, I personally used several methods, let's take turns: <br><br><h5>  Sales and distribution </h5><br>  From time to time, program developers arrange sales or even distribute their products, for example, yesterday Twitter broke out with <a href="https://twitter.com/1Password/status/339830415810510848">tweets</a> that the legendary <a href="https://agilebits.com/onepassword">1Password had</a> sold out with a 50% discount: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2ea/1c9/72f/2ea1c972ff4b8c2067510d3600d50b2c.jpg"><br><br>  For catching such offers, of course, Twitter ( <a href="https://twitter.com/iOS_Russia">iOS_Russia</a> , for example) and specialized sites like <a href="http://appshopper.com/mac/">appshopper.com</a> , <a href="https://deals.macupdate.com/">macupdate.com</a> , <a href="https://deals.cultofmac.com/">Cult Of Mac are</a> <a href="https://deals.macupdate.com/">suitable</a> . <br><br>  Program developers are quite often generous, and after a distribution or a sale, very worthwhile products get in, it‚Äôs only a matter of time to get the right program. <br><br><h5>  Bundles </h5><br>  In addition to software sales, so-called bundles (packages) are quite common when several programs are combined and sold at a price that is obviously less than the total, for example: <a href="https://stacksocial.com/sales/the-mac-productivity-bundle-4-0%3Faid%3Da-1rvhy226">The Mac Productivity Bundle 4.0</a> or <a href="https://deals.cultofmac.com/giveaways/omni-group-bundle-giveaway--2">Omni Group Bundle Giveaway</a> (have you already finished, where are you?). <br><br>  The benefit of such offers is undoubted: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/16b/2c2/1b2/16b2c21b2d3d858012a7275b73a8b787.jpg"><br><br>  Most remarkable, in such packages almost always there are necessary and useful programs! <br><br>  Also packages can be distributed completely free of charge: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/64f/f5a/c30/64ff5ac306432145dfd9b9661b85089c.jpg"><br><br>  Sources: the same Twitter and old familiar sites <a href="https://deals.macupdate.com/">macupdate.com</a> , <a href="https://deals.cultofmac.com/">Cult Of Mac</a> , <a href="https://stacksocial.com/tags/apple-mac">stacksocial.com</a> . <br><br><h5>  [life hacking] Unpacking bundles </h5><br>  Often there are situations when only one program is needed from a bundle with a bargain price, what to do?  Buy the whole package for the full amount and overpay for unnecessary software? <br><br>  There is a solution: on websites selling bundles, there are technical support pages with discussion of bundles, problems, etc.  We write off with users who have bought / are going to buy a package and offer to buy a specific program for a certain amount. <br><br>  After successful negotiations (mostly in English), we transfer money via PayPal: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6fd/947/05f/6fd94705fb1295ed667ef1459ed40589.jpg"><br><br>  and enjoy the licensed legal program: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c4c/6b9/eaa/c4c6b9eaa03320c012ba82d8dbf56e2c.jpg"><br><br><blockquote>  Sending money to strangers - there is a certain risk, but trust abroad is spelled out in blood and the constitution, so two cases of unpacking the bundle were successful.  In a pinch, there is PayPal with its Problem Resolution Center. </blockquote><br><br>  Good luck in legalization, friends! <br><br>  <b>UPD</b> : here come <a href="http://promo.paddle.com/pay-what-you-want-mac-bundle">svezhachok</a> . </hh></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/181656/">https://habr.com/ru/post/181656/</a></p>
