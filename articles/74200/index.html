TK and estimate</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  (2009, the second letter of the senior manager of the web-studio to the younger one) <br>  So, the initial negotiations with the client are held.  We look at the first part of the training manual here <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/studiobusiness/45543/">http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/studiobusiness/45543/</a> . <br>  Now we need to orient the client at a price.  If he agrees with her in principle, we proceed to discuss the Terms of Reference (TOR). <br>  Making an estimate <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Estimate </h3><br>  Estimates are usually divided into two main parts: <br><br>  -development of design (design, layout, corporate identity) <br>  -development of the software part (CMS core, functional modules, content) <br><br>  Here it is important to remember about the following life experiences: <br>  The client can say: <i>"and</i> what's <i>there, programming, my system administrator will do"</i> <br>  Or: <i>"Not well, but what, the design - will make my system administrator"</i> <br>  Or - <i>"You know, these and these and these modules - I don't need fucking, we decided to save"</i> <br>  That is, the estimate should be made in such a way as to give the client the opportunity to vary the price - but, if possible, minimally. Critical things must be tied tightly to the development.  For example, increase the cost of the ‚ÄúCMS Core‚Äù and reduce the cost of the modules.  The same applies to the price for the design - if possible, the price for the design and programming should be balanced.

      Estimates - usually a simple Excel file, it is desirable to make a decent one.  Below is a simple sketch. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/c6f/82b/f33/c6f82bf33823e3f58730d255e6ac9319.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  It is very important not to forget to separately evaluate the work on filling the site.  Content is a straw that can turn into a "log in the eye." <br>  More than once it happened when the time for filling was spent TWO more than the development. <br>  Also in the estimate it is necessary to make items about the development of TK, testing, SEO and so on. <br><br>  Then, if the estimate is approximately approved - move on. <br>  Now the task is to write a technical task.  Based on the terms of reference - to sign the contract. <br>  <i>(Or you can first sign an agreement, then do the TZ. Or sign an agreement of intent to develop and work with the TK. It‚Äôs better to look at the client.)</i> <br>  I usually write TK separately, then we sign an agreement based on it. <br><br><h3>  Writing TK </h3><br>  TK for the project is extremely desirable to do.  This is the main shield from an inadequate client. <br>  For example, a large customer, you communicate with the marketing department and show the layout and receive an answer in the spirit of <i>"you know, our director has looked and he wants to place a greeting with his photo under the logo and change the design concept."</i> <br>  In this case, we get TZ, we say - <i>"was not</i> . <i>"</i>  We are finalizing either for an additional payment or refuse to refine <i>"as it contradicts the original TK</i> . <i>"</i>  In the contract it is desirable to clearly fix these points.  The contract is a very interesting topic.  If you have not yet seen it, be sure to look and take an example from the Dark Treaty <a href="http://www.tema.ru/jj/RIBBA-sait-2009.doc">http://www.tema.ru/jj/RIBBA-sait-2009.doc</a> .  On Habr√©, too, flashed reflections on contracts ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/studiobusiness/57151/">habrahabr.ru/blogs/studiobusiness/57151</a> ) <br>  It is important that there are several sample TK for typical work.  For example, a corporate site, an online store or an intranet site.  With a well-made template - the preparation of a real TZ, for example at an online store, takes 30-60 minutes - we simply work as a sculptor, cut off the excess from the template. <br>  Good TK should be clear: <br>  - to the client; <br>  - it should be transparent - for the designer, - coder; <br>  - should be transparent - for the programmer; <br>  - it would not be bad if the manager who develops the TK - also understood the minimum; <br><br>  In the TK for the development of the site must be considered: <br>  -Requirements for design; <br>  - Layout requirements; <br>  -Requirements to the functionality of the site; <br><br>  Also interesting: <br>  -Requirements to the content; <br>  -Requirements to the server; <br>  -Requirements for the load; <br><br>  But in 50% of cases they are unlikely to be needed. <br><br>  Let's try to throw in fish for TK for a potential automotive community site. <br>  I place it on the <a href="http://pula.com.ua/pub/riba_na_tz.html">link</a> , because it will be long and boring - for fans of action and Chuck Norris is not recommended. <br><br>  We agreed the technical task, we sign the contract. <br>  After the adoption of the design - we must sign the act of adopting a graphic layout. <br>  and the logical end of work - the bilateral act of acceptance of work. <br><br>  Afterword: <br><br>  After signing the contract - we are working on the project. <br>  We add the client to the project management system. <br>  Here you can use free systems such as track, mantis.  There are many advantages - free and flexible, if you get used to it.  But they have one huge minus - from the point of view of the customer - a complex interface - if the client is not morally ready for what he sees - he enters the system, looks, comes out and ... continues to write you emails. <br>  We accidentally started a project 4 years ago in Beiskamp ( <a href="http://basecamphq.com/">http://basecamphq.com</a> ).  Two weeks later, they did not understand how they had worked before by mail.  Really saves time.  Of the benefits - this is a ready-made service, no need to customize anything, you can put your logo and put your subdomain.  Half of the clients at the sight of a subdomain such as <a href="http://xn--_-htbmnkthi8hg.basecamphq.com/">MY_STUDIO.basecamphq.com</a> thought that this was our development and asked to put such on their company).  The main plus is simplicity.  A couple of drawbacks - not quite flexible project management.  Last year we have been working with <a href="http://worksection.com/">http://worksection.com</a> , the closest analogue to Beyskamp in Russian.  (Egor Zhilev from <a href="http://turbomilk.ru/">Turbomilka</a> wrote a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/studiobusiness/45543/">good review</a> ). <br>  And finally, working with remote employees and employees in general.  While only one thought was born in a few years - "try to work only with good, adequate pros."  Minus is expensive and very difficult to find sane people.  Plus - the high cost of laying in the project, besides the quality of fights in subsequent orders.  And the biggest plus: the problems with delivery are much less.  The cost may differ by 30-60%, and the amount of hemorrhoids on the order. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/74200/">https://habr.com/ru/post/74200/</a></p>
