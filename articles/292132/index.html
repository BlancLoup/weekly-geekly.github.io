For a complete picture, it is necessary to analyze the totality of all indicators and be sure to know what customers themselves think about the work of employees.

      We want to share with you our implementation of <b>the quality assessment of the work of support</b> .  It allows: <i>clients to</i> evaluate responses, <i>employees</i> to receive feedback about their work and correct mistakes made, and <i>management</i> to monitor an additional indicator, which along with the others, helps to determine the objective level of service. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h3>  What are estimates for and how to get them? </h3><br>  The task of any support service employee is to close the request so that the client is satisfied.  If everything is clear with closing, then there are nuances with the degree of satisfaction.  Often, the last customer response is difficult to determine how he was satisfied with the quality of service. <br><br>  The simplest solution is to send a letter to the client with a request to evaluate the work of the employee after the closure of the application.  This will be discussed.  However, do not rush to think that everything is so banal :) We have implemented a lot of useful features and have thought through every little thing. <br><br><h3>  How to configure the functionality? </h3><br>  It all starts with a small option in the admin account settings: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f14/f0f/568/f14f0f5684d34ecca23685dffd78253e.png" alt="Response Assessment Feature Disabled"><br><br>  When this option is enabled, additional settings appear, a rule is automatically created to send a letter asking you to evaluate the quality of the employee‚Äôs work, and a new subsection of statistics is added - ‚ÄúQuality of Replies‚Äù. <br><br>  For more convenience, the text of the tooltip contains two links that lead to the created rule and the new subsection of statistics: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e6d/cb2/945/e6dcb29453b44acc836a103fe10bc311.png" alt="Response Assessment Feature Enabled"><br><br>  Next, you should decide what kind of access to employee ratings and comments customers should have. <br><br>  <b>a)</b> By default, the item <b>‚Äúonly estimates for each treatment‚Äù is</b> active.  In this case, employees see a brief statistic in the ‚ÄúDashboard‚Äù section and estimates for each call, but without comments to them.  Employees in general understand how well they cope with their tasks, but they do not see the whole picture and cannot influence the assessment after the fact. <br><br>  <i>This option is useful if you, as an administrator, want to provide employees with as little evaluation data as possible and plan to independently monitor and analyze the quality of their responses</i> . <br><br>  <b>b)</b> When selecting the <b>‚Äúlist of all ratings and comments to them‚Äù</b> item <b>, the</b> original functionality remains the same, but additional changes occur: <br><br><ul><li>  In the employee's account, a subsection ‚ÄúNew assessments‚Äù appears, where assessments are processed on the ‚ÄúInbox Zero‚Äù principle; </li><li>  in all appeals not only ratings, but also comments to them are displayed; </li><li>  A new rule is added to the administrator‚Äôs account, with which you can send a letter to the client for reassessment. </li></ul><br>  <i>If you want the employee to fully analyze their performance, correct mistakes and get the best grades, stop at this option</i> . <br><br>  Let's analyze in detail all the nuances of ratings for each participant in the process. <br><br><h3>  What and how does the client? </h3><br>  For your client, everything is as simple as possible.  After closing the application, he receives a letter asking him to assess the quality of the employee‚Äôs responses: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4ec/876/400/4ec87640075f464b8581f2555afef62e.png" alt="A letter asking you to evaluate the level of service"><br><br>  You just need to choose one of the three options and leave a comment on the assessment on a separate page: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8ec/d3b/839/8ecd3b83943043f1ac537351a0226cda.png" alt="Review page for rating"><br><br>  If the <b>‚Äúlist of all ratings and comments to them‚Äù</b> item was selected in the settings of the functionality, then after receiving an unsatisfactory rating, the employee can correct his mistake and close the appeal again to send a letter to the customer for re-evaluation.  In this case, the letter looks a little different: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/330/78a/3d3/33078a3d3b15487782234279fc2425fb.png" alt="Revaluation Letter"><br><br>  The client can also <b>evaluate the quality of service in his account in the support center</b> . <br><br>  <b>a)</b> When a client closes the request on his own, we immediately suggest that he evaluate the work of the employee. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7bf/09d/fbb/7bf09dfbba834105ae1283cd67833517.png" alt="Modal window for evaluation in the client's account"><br><br>  <b>b)</b> In closed requests without evaluation, a special link is displayed in the left sidebar - ‚ÄúEvaluate the quality of answers‚Äù. <br><br><h3>  How does an employee work with grades? </h3><br>  If you decide not to ‚Äúload‚Äù an employee by working with grades and <b>stop at the basic settings</b> , he will see only minor changes. <br><br>  <b>1)</b> In the brief statistics, a new item will be added with data on the quality of the answers: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/724/c52/e19/724c52e196034ddbad9183c55a830d98.png" alt="Brief statistics with a response quality indicator"><br><br>  <b>2)</b> A new column will appear in the list of requests immediately after the "Subject" column, by which you can easily determine the resulting assessment: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/719/33d/d9b/71933dd9bad742a1af2c17aae61aef0a.png" alt="Ratings in the list of hits"><br><br>  <b>3)</b> A new field will appear in the call options - ‚ÄúUser Rating‚Äù: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7a0/864/6be/7a08646be1a040b58f14e3a447d749c1.png" alt="Estimation in treatment parameters"><br><br>  In fact, an employee only monitors his performance, and no action is required on his part. <br><br>  If, when setting up the functionality, you selected the item <b>‚Äúa list of all assessments and comments to them‚Äù</b> , the employee‚Äôs capabilities become significantly greater. <br><br>  <b>4)</b> In the ‚ÄúControl Panel‚Äù section, the ‚ÄúNew ratings‚Äù subsection appears, which allows you to work with ratings on the ‚ÄúInbox Zero‚Äù principle: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eba/363/55f/eba36355f88f4df2959c1e4f88136d2d.png" alt="New scores in employee account"><br><br>  All assessments are initially displayed in the "new", so that the employee can read them and take action if necessary.  After this assessment is moved to the "processed". <br><br>  <b>5)</b> In the message itself, in the course of the correspondence, a rating is added with a comment, and the employee can easily understand exactly when it was given: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/385/a65/fe4/385a65fe4d19448898df452392b3a212.png" alt="Evaluation in circulation in the course of the correspondence"><br><br>  In the request parameters, the ‚ÄúUser Rating‚Äù field becomes a link - for a quick transition to the assessment with a comment. <br><br>  The same thing happens with smiles in the list of downloads.  Clicking on them not only opens the call, but also scrolls to the rating with a comment. <br><br>  <b>6)</b> When an employee gets a bad mark, he can apologize to the client and correct his mistake.  When the employee re-closes the application, it is enough to add a ‚Äúfor revaluation‚Äù label so that the client receives a letter for re-evaluation. <br><br><h3>  How does the administrator set up and analyze ratings? </h3><br>  We have already figured out that the letters for initial and re-evaluation are sent in accordance with the rules.  Let's take a look at them to see how flexible and easy to use. <br><br><h4>  Setting rules </h4><br>  <b>a)</b> <i>The rule "Letter to assess the quality of responses"</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/262/3d7/9a8/2623d79a869249a88bdb0c9bf44868d9.png" alt="The rule to send a letter for evaluation"><br><br>  The rule is standard, so it can not be disabled or deleted.  However, you can edit it on your own.  For example, in accordance with the rule, a letter is sent 24 hours after the appeal is closed.  You can set both 2 hours and 48. <br><br>  The subject and content of the letter can also be edited.  However, in this case, do not forget to add the variable [rating_options], which is responsible for inserting buttons for rating. <br><br>  By default, we insert the [previous_messages] variable to the end of the letter to display the last two responses in the circulation.  There are three variables in the history of correspondence: <br><br><ul><li>  the last answer is [previous_message]; </li><li>  last answer pair - [previous_messages]; </li><li>  history of all correspondence - [full_case_history]. </li></ul><br>  You can use any variable or even abandon the correspondence history in this letter. <br><br>  <b>b)</b> <i>The rule ‚ÄúLetter for reassessing the quality of answers‚Äù</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7a9/ee8/873/7a9ee8873d044a32a235afed807ff1a3.png" alt="The rule to send a letter for re-evaluation"><br><br>  This rule is also standard, but it can be either edited or disabled.  You can not just delete. <br><br>  In addition to the time from the close of circulation, there are additional conditions, the key of which is the presence of a certain label in circulation.  We‚Äôve added a revaluation tag, but you can use another one. <br><br>  <i>What is the label for this rule?</i>  It allows the employee to decide when to send a letter for re-evaluation.  That is, until the employee adds the label, the rule will not work, and the letter will not be sent. <br><br>  When editing this rule, do not forget to add the [current_rating] variable to display the previously set grade. <br><br><h4>  Employee performance analysis </h4><br>  As soon as you activate the functionality for evaluating the work of your employees, a new subsection of statistics will appear in the "Team" section - "Quality of Responses". <br><br>  It displays both general indicators with dynamics, and the entire list of ratings received by employees: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/340/c34/ece/340c34ecef044aaca31107abc3b5eabd.png" alt="Statistics estimated in the administrator account"><br><br>  In the list of assessments, the <b>time and date are a link</b> to the appeal in the employee‚Äôs account.  If you click on an employee, <b>only the employee‚Äôs ratings</b> will be displayed. <br><br>  In addition to the new subsection, there are other changes in the statistics - the column <b>‚Äú% of the quality of answers‚Äù</b> appears in the table of the ‚ÄúBest in team‚Äù subsection.  Now this table allows you to get a complete picture, which was discussed at the beginning. <br><br><h3>  How is the quality of answers calculated for short statistics? </h3><br>  A new indicator on the quality of answers is in the brief statistics (section ‚ÄúControl Panel‚Äù) in both the administrator‚Äôs account and the employee‚Äôs account.  It is calculated as follows: <br><br>  <i>% of hits with rating ‚ÄúExcellent‚Äù -% of calls with rating ‚ÄúWeak‚Äù</i> <br><br>  For example, you have 82% "Excellent", 12% "Not bad" and 6% "Weak."  In this case, the quality of the answers will be 76%. <br><br>  The logic is simple.  ‚ÄúExcellent‚Äù marks can be proud of, so their percentage is taken as a basis.  Estimates of ‚ÄúNot bad‚Äù are not an indicator of excellent quality, and their percentage is not counted as a plus.  Ratings "Weak" means that there are problems, so their percentage reduces the overall quality of the answers. <br><br><h3>  Other moments </h3><br>  <b>1)</b> If the appeal was initiated by an employee (the first answer is not from the user), then the letter for evaluation is not sent. <br><br>  <b>2) The</b> link from the letter for evaluation and commenting works only once.  When you go over it again, the client sees a page on which it is indicated that his assessment has already been taken into account. <br><br>  <b>3)</b> Edit and delete estimates can not.  If you are testing the functionality and do not want the test score to distort the real picture, simply delete (first in the basket, and after - from it) the test appeal. <br><br>  <b>4)</b> In his account in the support center, the client can change the rating set within 24 hours. <br><br>  <b>5)</b> When receiving a new assessment, the old assessment is replaced with a new one everywhere: in statistics, in the list of appeals and in the appeals themselves. <br><br>  - <br><br>  We hope you enjoy our implementation of the quality assessment of the work of support.  There are a lot of interesting and useful features on <a href="https://omnidesk.ru/">Omnideska</a> , so we are waiting for you :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/292132/">https://habr.com/ru/post/292132/</a></p>
