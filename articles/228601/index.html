  <section class="page js-page"><h1>LifeTrak: we thought Pebble had no competitors</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the fall of 2014, the fourth LifeTrak account with the R450 (R415) index will go on sale.  The company has successfully discovered the possibility of compasses, and created the first round gadget in its product line. <br><br>  At the same time, such a radical approach to form is accompanied by a traditional careful approach to ‚Äúcontent‚Äù.  Those who remember how LifeTrak devices <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/medgadgets/blog/225133/">were</a> sensitively <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/medgadgets/blog/225133/">changed</a> , then the R450 doesn‚Äôt wait for a revolution. In the new gadget, the number of key features announced by the developer will increase only by one, from 12 to 13!  In general, the watch is not for the superstitious. <br><br>  We, as the official distributor of LifeTrak in the Russian Federation, were among the first to get a novelty and test it.  What we liked and what is not in the new watch from LifeTrak - we read under the cut.

The new LifeTrak looks logical even with a classic suit, not to mention a less pretentious dress. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/686/ccf/1a6/686ccf1a65ab1fae815c4ef8d85c718a.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/629/f36/478/629f364789d26602fc943f0a79ce874e.jpg"><br><br>  R450 inherited interchangeable multi-colored straps, so you can fit the gadget into a catchy youth wardrobe. <br><br>  For those who for some reason hide their interest in wearable devices, it is important that the new LifeTrak has acquired the usual form of hours in which it is difficult to discern the calorie counter. <br><br>  The straps are comfortable because they are dimensionless and tightly fit the wrist of any size. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6fe/838/265/6fe83826516baca42a93360a242b25a0.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ade/e08/8c1/adee088c1f11d66fc2d8b9602ae77c83.jpg"><br><br>  The straps are removable, they can be fixed with any colored side out. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8ac/8e7/f7a/8ac8e7f7a27821881d648a7397057919.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c07/653/694/c07653694892a8776a4c2aaf3218be4f.jpg"><br><br>  Several shades of gray display all the necessary data on the LCD: date, time, steps, calories burned, percentage of goals achieved. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/052/21e/620/05221e620cd9abfb77988e71c54e6991.jpg"><br><br>  The "control panel" of the three buttons allows you to switch different indicators on the screen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3e1/2af/435/3e12af43506befac72024584edcff540.jpg"><br><br><h4>  What we liked about LifeTrak R450 </h4><br>  Whatever you say, but by functionality this gadget has outgrown the category of activity trackers or pedometers.  This is a full-fledged smart watch, which will cost a little more than <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/lifetrak-smart-r415.html">5,000 rubles</a> . <br><br><h5>  Among the main advantages: </h5><br>  - The gadget is very active when, it would seem, the least needed - during sleep.  Hours assess the quality and duration of sleep and react to the slightest movement in the process.  In addition, the R450 recognizes the time when a person falls asleep and wakes up, there is also a smart alarm function that makes waking comfortable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7ea/f35/d41/7eaf35d41881a644529de43ca0608989.jpg"><br>  <i>Sleeping mode</i> <br><br>  - The developers emphasize that the new device monitors all types of activity, including false activity, and insist that all random movements will not be counted as an extra step (than the same Jawbone could have sinned).  At the same time, the gradation in speed is maintained: step / run, loads: straight road / stairs, which is also taken into account when generating a report on calories burned. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/361/a23/cd1/361a23cd1f2622f7458aa7c6b681ecfd.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0d9/884/2b0/0d98842b02fde5d5a7872577ebf8c88c.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7af/436/d19/7af436d19190dd08e7ccc9c925c97e07.jpg"><br><br>  - The pulsometer was missing for many trackers, so the R450 immediately got + 100 to karma.  The claimed accuracy of the indicators for the ECG results, the heart rate monitor is activated by pressing a button.  It is important that the meter works without the use of a chest belt. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0b4/251/8e2/0b42518e223c1c25c602478ac5683299.jpg"><br><br>  - Water resistance is important on many levels.  First of all, this quality will be appreciated by those who regularly visit the pool and want to understand the value of their workouts.  Plus it will be for holidaymakers in the beach season.  Diving up to 30 meters without damage is something that neither Fitbit nor Nike could boast. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d83/342/c92/d83342c927080a0bb742bd9c259b1669.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5ad/068/da7/5ad068da7f7aa5703f3106d1f27005b3.jpg"><br><br>  - Memory is enough to show you the seven-day schedule of your success and achievements.  Daily results are reset to midnight, and you can set new goals every day. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3c5/409/0d2/3c54090d2b0c75d2e5c49416bb079b85.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3c6/38e/25c/3c638e25c0a16e3e0f3ba102d7067ae0.jpg"><br>  <i>Setting a goal in 10,000 steps.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/052/21e/620/05221e620cd9abfb77988e71c54e6991.jpg"><br>  <i>The fulfillment of the goal is only 204 steps out of 10,000, still ahead.</i> <br><br>  - The clock does not need to be charged.  Like the models of previous generations, the R450 runs on batteries, which last up to 6 months. <br><br>  A completely new feature has been added to this incomplete list of advanced features.  Now the application with which the device is synchronized sends an alert for new messages, letters, calls.  And although this addition is rather controversial, it seems that it will find its fans. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/02c/e60/5f4/02ce605f47419c5e734a47a9e5213d2b.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3c5/698/609/3c569860923a9d586b664defa12bdc93.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/570/d2e/f9c/570d2ef9cedfdf9731abfc5fa00b0adf.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/968/897/090/968897090b18dc2fa14c034e1c9a91e1.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/962/1cd/0a3/9621cd0a36bc77f8b3ffd6b89dc9e952.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/415/4e7/8fe/4154e78fe808889f14dff4c428df0684.jpg"><br><br><h4>  App </h4><br>  Graphics R450 is archaic, so many will be comfortable working with applications.  In addition to the official LifeTrak (which will be released in August of this year), you can use Argus or MapMyFitness.  True, at the moment Argus also has problems synchronizing with the new tracker.  We are sure that the official start of sales of the tracker software will be finalized. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b2a/e12/fa7/b2ae12fa75f4c0290ec0ab1caf51cea7.jpg"><br><br>  Needless to say, it is easier and more pleasant to read the data on the big screen than on the sub-blind dial, although by and large you will not see any superdata there. <br><br>  The laconic design and simple interface of official applications are rather a virtue. <br><br>  Will be there: <br>  - completed steps <br>  - calories burned <br>  - heart rate <br>  - distance traveled <br>  - sleep duration <br><br>  All this will be visually decorated with graphs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/10b/367/3df/10b3673dfc8baac419f146fc84c08640.png"><br><br><h4>  Smart or not Smart </h4><br>  Authors of reviews are bolder, and include a novelty in the class of smart watches, although the developer himself, although with the prefix "smart", but leaves his device in the trackers.  Judging by the primary set of functions, the R450 is poorer, say, Gear 2, which can take pictures and turn on the TV. <br><br>  On the other hand, it‚Äôs still a clock that counts the pulse and sends notifications of missed calls.  Yes, and for the price they are slightly knocked out of a number of similar devices, such as Ihealth or Misfit.  Probably, it would be correct to talk about some kind of transitional type of wearable gadgets, but for this there are no substantial reasons, except perhaps the already many-mentioned notifications and the heart rate monitor. <br><br>  <a href="http://lifetrakusa.com/products/smart/">Officially,</a> LifeTrak R450 goes on sale in September 2014, you can leave a pre-order or inquire about the availability of a watch tracker on our <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/lifetrak-smart-r415.html">website</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/228601/">https://habr.com/ru/post/228601/</a></p>
