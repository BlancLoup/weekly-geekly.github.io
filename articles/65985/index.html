  <section class="page js-page"><h1>VimpelCom and its 3G (three G)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In 2004, being in a sober mind and a firm memory, I pushed the contract for the provision of communication services with the above-mentioned campaign, thus becoming its <s>breadwinner as a</s> subscriber along with the other representatives of the citizens eager for mobile communication.  From that day, and to this inclusive, the pipe in hand, we overcame the path through the thorns to the bees: space tariffs for voice and wap, rated fact of connection, gurgling / croaking / tearing connection, buggy GPRS / EDGE tests ... In every way, and most importantly, stably helping Big Middle on this way (1-3K per month) was called into the whole range of paid / not-so services, including sms-chats, mms, mobile e-mail, roaming and many others, and after 5-fold restoration of the sim-card I became right identify yourself as a 5-time champion in restoring a sim card, and as a ‚Äúrespected  tarozhilam "with 5 years of experience among VimpelCom customers that confirmed further scrutiny √† la endless voice questioning on her part.  3G crept unnoticed, diluting the established relationship between us strong relationship is not clear than. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  <b>1G.</b>  <b>Tariff plan.</b> </h5>  To begin with, the tariff chosen by me for changing the default is activated a full day after the application is submitted.  In today's day, given the existing computing power, the financial capabilities of the service provider operator, the total elimination of paper documents, as well as the importance of the Internet and the pace of life in general, such a delay looks strange if not ridiculous.  Yes, the operator provides access to the network using a 3G modem immediately when the latter is connected to a PC, using 20MB of traffic, but it actually forces you to spend funds ‚Äúcharged‚Äù on the balance, reserved for switching to another tariff plan, since  critical OS security updates, as well as anti-virus database / modules, reset this traffic instantly.  The choice between daily expectation-vs-unsafe surfing is not in favor of the operator, and it‚Äôs not a matter of ‚Äúgiving a little to start‚Äù, no, I‚Äôm ready to spend my hard-earned money, but at the ‚Äúnightless Unlimited‚Äù that suits me for which the reserve is 700r with the thought that the Internet is secured for a month.  As if not so. <br><br><h5>  <b>2g.</b>  <b>Speed.</b> </h5>  It's amazing why there is no ‚Äú136G - modem !! 1‚Äù advertising. It works in the networks of thirty thirty sixth generation !! 1?  Here, as it turned out (the place of action is the harsh Chelyabinsk region, Chrysostom) there is no third generation network and it is not known when it will be.  There is a suspicion that EDGE works, because  The peak speed reaches 11-12 kb / s, occasionally and not for long, and the lion's share of time is provided only by GPRS.  What, I ask, I even bought a 3G modem, if my phone, which I am currently surfing due to the problem described below, and so provides me with GPRS / EDGE technology?  This is despite the fact that the girl consultant suggested that the 3G network is present, the actual speed is equal to that declared throughout the coverage area, and the coverage area covers me with my head.  The result of experiments in different parts of the city (yes, I was not too lazy to check, even with another modem, and on another machine) was just as pitiable.  Strange. <br><br><h5>  <b>3G.</b>  <b>Well, the balance.</b> </h5>  At night, in the middle of the session, there was a break, although there had not been one before.  After checking the state, I made sure that the balance was not exhausted - the balance is 18 rubles, according to the tariff it is about a night of surfing, nothing to worry about. However, I could not get on the Internet.  I call support, I explain, operator Dmitry reports:

      <i><b>D .:</b> ‚ÄúYes, there are problems, incorrect display of the balance - you have 18p, we have 0, we will fix it in 24 hours.‚Äù</i> <i><br></i>  <i><b>I:</b> ‚ÄúHow so?</i>  <i>I follow the state of my balance, and I was sure that the amount on it would be enough to surf calmly until morning, and you would mislead me as it were and did a ‚Äúbummer‚Äù, because</i>  <i>it's night in the yard and I'm in a country house 20km from the city. ‚Äù</i> <i><br></i>  <i><b>D .:</b> ‚ÄúOur campaign provides its customers with a bonus of 30p, we activate it, is it going?‚Äù</i> <i><br></i>  <i><b>Me:</b> ‚ÄúGo, thank you.‚Äù</i> <br><br>  The situation repeats itself in exactly one day, as there was no need to replenish the balance - after all, 48r, but why?  I call, the operator begins to convince me that there is no technical possibility to fix something there.  With that, they promised to fix it a day ago.  Well, the problem is not solved, access to the network is limited, I say goodbye without enthusiasm. <br><br>  Today's Groundhog Night made me use my mobile phone with a veteran sim as a modem and write this angry post.  The operator did not hear, as already persistently convinces me that I have problems, not them.  It turns out, following the logic of the VimpelCom campaign or its operators, the situation in which the user, verifying the positive status of his balance by means of a USSD request (the balance is also positive and on uslugi.beeline.ru) does not receive communication services, including Internet access, is normal.  And for information about the real state of the account, he should call the operator at any time of the day or night in order to find out that the balance, surprisingly enough - at zero, the service of specialists did not cope with the problem for 4 days and is also unavailable today (call tomorrow), chic a bonus of 30 rubles is given unfortunately once every three months.  The balance of the mobile will not pull "Mobile translation", to the city limits of 20km, and with all this, all these problems are mine :) <br><br>  This is all strange ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/65985/">https://habr.com/ru/post/65985/</a></p>
