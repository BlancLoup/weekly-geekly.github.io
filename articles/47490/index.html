  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Saving a blog on blogger.com</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This post has two parts: <br>  1. How strange it sometimes happens (the details of blocking a blog due to improper triggering of antispam scripts on google blogger.com), <br>  2. How to save your blog if nothing helps (if a clean block is not unblocked for a long time). <br><br>  So what's the problem? <br>  By contacting search engines with the question ‚ÄúIf you do not request a revision, the blog will be deleted within 20 days,‚Äù you can be sure that many people have ever received such a message from the automatic blocking system of suspicious blogs.  The meaning of this action is quite understandable: a large number of bad blogs are blocked, and a small number of good ones that have accidentally suffered will be ‚Äúbleached‚Äù in manual mode.  If the operators work quickly, then no one will have difficulties. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  The complete message looks like this: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <i>This blog has been suspended due to a possible violation of the Blogger Terms of Service.</i>  <i>You will not be able to post new posts until the blog is reviewed and unlocked.</i>  <i>If you do not request a review, the blog will be deleted within 20 days.</i> <br><br>  I received such a message on December 4 (18 days ago), immediately requested an unlock (clicked on the appropriate link + correctly entered the captcha), but still can‚Äôt write to the blog.  Now, if I click on the ‚Äúrequest a review‚Äù link, I see a kind text ‚ÄúWe received your unlock request on 4 December 2008 ... On behalf of all robots, we apologize for blocking your blog.  Suffer a little while we review your blog and make sure that there is no spam in it. ‚Äù <br><br>  All this means that Google‚Äôs operators do not always work quickly (18 days have passed!).  It is clear that Google is not obliged to immediately correct the errors of its scripts.  By the way, in this case we are talking about an error, because the blog is perfectly clean: it contains only its texts, no schemes for getting or selling links, no advertising (of course, the blog is not for making money).  In addition, there is an activity of commentators and generally not the smallest number of subscribers (450-500), which once again confirms the meaningfulness of the blog (it is among the ten most popular blogspot on the Yandex engine).  Therefore, I wanted more agile actions (it was possible to sort the blocked blogs by the number of subscribers in order to first process the most popular ones). <br><br>  But while I honestly waited for unlocking, another problem got out.  It turns out that the blog is almost gone from the indexes of all search engines, so the number of visitors fell from 150-200 per day to 30-50).  It turned out that this is due to the fact that a blocked blog cannot be indexed by search engines (special lines for this appeared in the robots.txt file).  I repeat that this trouble is not big either, since the blog does not show ads and I have no obligation to anyone, but not much pleasant again. <br><br>  But enough about the bad, because nothing is lost yet.  Now will be the promised part with the answer to the question " <b>what to do?</b> " <br><br>  So, if it is impossible to use the google engine anymore, because there are no rights to create posts, and reader access is difficult for the old notes, then you can transfer the blog to your server.  Therefore, the question arose: what is the easiest way to pull out all the notes and comments to them?  After all, having done this, it will be possible to write your own script that loads old notes on a new engine. <br><br>  I didn't want to write my parsilka, so I used the BlogBackupOnline.com service, which quickly and free generated the xml file with all the blog entries already posted + all the comments.  Surely there are dozens of similar programs, but this service was the first to complete the task entirely.  By the way, I recommend all bloggers to periodically maintain a blog with a similar service so as not to lose the accumulated interesting material due to the failure of the hoster.  <b>UPD</b> Thanks to Karguine, who advised the statutory way to export blogs - follow the link <a href="">draft.blogger.com/export-blog.g?blogID=XXXXXX</a> (there should be a blog number here). <br><br>  After a few days, it will become clear whether Google will remove this blog (it will be about 20 days from the promise to remove), and there‚Äôs no unlock during the holidays.  If for the whole of December there was no person who would look at the blog, then on New Year's weeks, all the more you should not hope for it. <br><br>  There are two morals: <br>  1. Always make backups (this is in all aspects of life such morality :-). <br>  2. If you are doing some kind of anti-spam mechanism, then try to sort the incoming requests for transfer to the white list by the size of the banned one (in order to quickly solve the problems of more serious people first). <br><br>  There are two questions too: <br>  Are you familiar with the cases of such long locks?  Did it somehow win? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/47490/">https://habr.com/ru/post/47490/</a></p>
