  <section class="page js-page"><h1>"Freebie" through the eyes of the teacher</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  While still a student, I heard from one of the teachers an interesting idea that made me think about the benefits of freebies for a student.  This ‚Äúsemi-teacher‚Äù didn‚Äôt particularly bother with teaching the students, it was easier to get credit for him, the students adored him.  And in vain.  His philosophy was as follows: "the less students know, the more I pay, as a specialist." <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Prehistory </h4><br>  Three years ago I graduated from one of the branches of the prestigious Moscow Technical University.  He studied with the desire to become an IT specialist, even though the specialty was more focused on mathematics.  He graduated with honors.  During my studies, I had a good relationship with my supervisor, as a result, he invited me to graduate school after graduation.  In addition to graduate school I was offered to try teaching at our university.  I agreed, because in this situation I would spend more time at the university, where I could spend more time on my dissertation. <br><br><h4>  Story </h4><br>  Becoming a teacher, I ran into a student from the other side.  Literally in a month I had to reconsider my attitude towards classes.  I began to try to teach students, and not only to teach programming directly.  I tried to explain to them how to relate to different disciplines, how to single out the main and secondary ones, how to set priorities and much more to which I had to go myself.  Over time, to my chagrin, I saw that students and the education system themselves are forcing teachers to set off tests for free.  Students think that by coming to the last 2 pairs in the semester, and a couple of times in the test week I have to put them on credit.  They bring labs downloaded from the Internet from their friends and sincerely wonder why I send them back.  Well, I can‚Äôt accept a lab from a student who doesn‚Äôt even understand what not only the variables in his program mean, but also the keywords of the language (!), Not to mention the logic of the program.  And then I remembered that "semi-teacher."  This philosophy does not suit me, because  I am an executive person by nature and I take my duties seriously enough. <br><br><h4>  Teacher's dilemma </h4><br>  The existing system of higher education at the university is built in such a way that it is profitable for the teacher (!) To set off students for free.  I will try to explain. <br>  The teacher is paid two consultations, 2 academic hours per week during the semester and 3 consultations per week during the session.  Those.  the teacher in the session is obliged to give students only 3 academic hours per week.  Naturally, all the ‚Äútailors‚Äù do not have time to surrender all their debts for these notorious 3 hours and the teacher is forced to spend on students who walked for the whole semester, his personal time (at that time he could work on his thesis, relax with his family, do business with home and more).  As a result, we get a teacher who has to spend hours at the university that are not paid for him, which take place on days and months.  But this is a responsible teacher. <br>  On the other hand, a semi-teacher can put all his students on credit for free.  Such a teacher frees himself not only his legal free time, but also paid hours of consultations.  And she can go somewhere to work in addition, go on vacation, and just relax and spend time with the family.  And, if in the prestigious universities such an attitude is not common (although more recently), then in commercial universities we get a whole system of fake tests and exams, which leads to a lot of fake ‚Äúspecialists‚Äù and ‚Äúbachelors‚Äù.  A depressing picture of our future is emerging.

    <h4>  Opinion </h4><br>  I, as a teacher, as a specialist in my field, as a patriot in the end, this situation does not suit.  I want students to leave my classes with knowledge in their heads.  In a couple of years I don‚Äôt want someone with indignation to ask a former student ‚Äúwho taught you to program like this?‚Äù And the answer to this question would be my person.  Therefore, I demand knowledge from students, so each session has to work more.  And now the session is approaching and the students are every day more and more spudding my time on the subject ‚Äúcan you turn in lab # 1‚Äù ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/93217/">https://habr.com/ru/post/93217/</a></p>
