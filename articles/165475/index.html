However, building a virtual private cloud is not an easy task and requires serious time and financial investments.  As a solution to this problem, MUK Group of Companies recommends Vblock, a fully integrated platform for building converged data center infrastructure. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/253/073/9b9/2530739b960187c9a18b6f0fd524bf7b.png"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Much has already been written and written about the advantages of using private clouds in building data centers compared to traditional approaches.  These include reducing costs, increasing the flexibility and scalability of the infrastructure, and greater availability of information.  However, building a private cloud and virtualizing the infrastructure in practice is not an easy task.  Selecting, integrating, and customizing the components of a future data center can be a major headache for a company's IT department.  Do not forget about possible compatibility problems, which lead to a significant increase in the timing of implementation and entail an increase in the cost of operating solutions.  VCE presented its approach to solving these problems.  This is a Vblock platform that offers accelerated data center transformation technology and significantly reduces capital and operating expenses.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ce7/072/7d0/ce70727d0b5ebfcf3001068565fbd95f.jpg"><br><br>  <b>What is in the package?</b> <br><br>  Vblock is a fully integrated solution that allows you to deploy a fully virtualized cloud infrastructure.  VCE platforms combine equipment and technologies from leading global manufacturers - Cisco, EMC and VMware, combined into pre-configured Vblock Systems: <br>  ‚Ä¢ network infrastructure for data transmission and storage is formed by Cisco switches; <br>  ‚Ä¢ computing resources are provided by the Cisco Unified Computing System (Cisco UCS); <br>  ‚Ä¢ virtualization technologies are represented by VMware vSphere and vCenter platforms; <br>  ‚Ä¢ The storage infrastructure is implemented on EMC hardware - a Symmetrix VMAX or VNX model storage system; <br>  ‚Ä¢ EMC Ionix Unified Infrastructure Manager Management Tool; <br>  ‚Ä¢ additional equipment for the organization of racks, cable connections and power supplies. <br><br>  Vblock systems provide various storage volumes and performance levels of computing and network resources, and also support add-ins such as advanced security mechanisms and business continuity tools.  Each platform is preconfigured and optimized for specific tasks.  In addition, the systems are pre-tested for the work of various applications. <br><br>  <b>Simplicity and Reliability: The Benefits of the Vblock Platform</b> <br><br>  The main advantage of the Vblock platform is the complete integration of all its components.  All equipment is assembled in racks and equipped with the necessary cable connections and batteries, that is, it is actually supplied ready for deployment and use.  This approach can significantly reduce the time to install and configure the system and makes it possible to deploy the infrastructure as soon as possible.  In addition, the platform is configured by VCE engineers according to the customer‚Äôs predefined specifications.  Thus, IT administrators will be able to quickly deploy new applications.  This reduces the total cost of ownership compared to purchasing, deploying and managing comparable IT infrastructure as separate components. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/809/a60/e4b/809a60e4bd4b868a1f2bad27153c9cc7.png" align="left">  When integrating disparate components to build a single complex, the solution of emerging problems may be delayed due to the need to contact the support service of the respective vendors and, even in the case of a mono-vendor solution, to coordinate the work of individual departments.  But not in the case of Vblock.  VCE is a single point of contact for all support issues.  The service employs professionals with knowledge of all aspects of the operation of the Vblock Systems infrastructure, with deep expertise in integrating solutions from Cisco, EMC and VMware.  When you make a request for service, the technical support specialist will contact the customer ‚Äî the only contact you need to contact.  This specialist will work on the customer‚Äôs problem until it resolves it. <br><br>  Another important advantage of the VCE platform is the centralized management of the system.  In a virtualized infrastructure, with a large number of tasks, complexity begins with their maintenance.  EMC Ionix Unified Infrastructure Manager software provides simplified package management, including management of resource allocation, configuration, changes, and compliance with regulatory requirements.  A centralized console allows you to manage the consoles of all Vblock devices from a single control panel, which eliminates the need for engineers in the company's IT department for each type of equipment. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6a1/7c0/93c/6a17c093c2afe0cc9186d9fd41e65b3f.png"><br><br>  <b>Possible system configurations</b> <br><br>  Vblock infrastructure platforms scale to deliver the right performance and capacity to meet the needs of business applications.  At the moment there are two main families - Vblock Series 300 and Vblock Series 700, which include several models of the complex. <br><br>  The Vblock 300 line is designed to meet the needs of a wide range of companies.  The architecture of the platform is formed by EMC VNX storage systems, Cisco UCS blades and switches, EMC Ionix UIM / P resource allocation technology and VMware vSphere virtualization tool.  This platform supports scaling for small and medium-sized CRM and SCM systems, email, file sharing and printing, and collaboration.  The 300 series includes four models - EX, FX, GX and HX.  The main differences between the models are the scalability of storage and computing power. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f9d/568/679/f9d568679ffb360d2d4c0fd33eb90120.png"><br><br>  Vblock 700 family models are designed to deploy very large virtualization infrastructures.  This platform will satisfy the most stringent requirements of ERP, CRM, database, collaboration tools and messaging services.  Vblock 700 Series systems are based on Cisco UCS server blades, Nexus and MDS network switches, EMC VMAX or VMAXe storage arrays, EMC Ionix UIM / P resource allocation technologies, and VMware vSphere virtualization platform.  The Vblock 700 series includes two models - LX and MX. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/171/431/b9b/171431b9b9324a5220b9360f85dc87b2.png"><br><br>  <b>Distributor‚Äôs Role in Vblock Platform Advancement</b> <br><br>  Since the autumn of 2011, the authorized distributor of VCE in Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Moldova and other countries is the MUK group of companies - the leader of project distribution, with competence in all technologies used in the Vblock platform.  In accordance with the VCE affiliate program, sales are made exclusively through the affiliate network.  MUK is ready to provide active assistance to partners in obtaining their partner status in VCE, training their technical specialists and sales managers.  The company has certified implementation and service engineers who can provide competent assistance in planning and deploying infrastructure, as well as solving various problems that have arisen.  You can get more detailed information by contacting the staff of the VCE direction by calling +380 44 492-29-29. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5a8/6ff/b32/5a86ffb32b98608438c103180964faa4.png"><br><br>  <b>As an afterword</b> <br><br>  At the end I would like to give a few numbers.  VCE conducts regular research with randomly selected customers, the purpose of which is to develop more efficient architectural and operational solutions, as well as to collect statistics on customer satisfaction.  The latest report was compiled by IDC in May 2012.  In it, among other things, the Vblock security statistics were collected: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/24e/848/787/24e8487872228fe4065da709ad7e564a.png"><br>  * Downtime and incidents for the whole year. <br>  Source: IDC white paper ‚ÄúConverging the Datacenter Infrastructure: Why, How, So, What?‚Äù Table 3. The full report is available at: <a href="http://www.vce.com/noindex/pdf/idc-vce-converging-datacenter-infrastructure.pdf">www.vce.com/noindex/pdf/idc-vce-converging-datacenter-infrastructure. pdf</a> <br><br>  In the last few years in the field of IT, one can observe an increase in demand for convergent systems.  This is confirmed by the presence of various integrated solutions in the portfolios of many developers, although they cannot be directly compared with the Vblock platform.  This is due to the fact that competitive solutions describe only the architecture recommended by the vendor, the purchase of the necessary equipment and the construction of the infrastructure is still entrusted to the end user.  The use of Vblock platforms allows companies to significantly reduce the cost of managing and supporting infrastructure.  Examples of successful implementation of the complex from VCE are already among domestic companies, particularly in the banking sector. <br><br><hr><br>  <a href="http://www.service.muk.ua/">MUK-Service - all types of IT repair: warranty, non-warranty repair, sale of spare parts, contract service</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/165475/">https://habr.com/ru/post/165475/</a></p>
