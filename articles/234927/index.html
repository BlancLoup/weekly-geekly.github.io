And although basic education with all its attributes, such as unforgettable student years, sessions, diploma, etc., has not been canceled, the modern eternal student, in search of an answer to his main question, ‚ÄúWhere else to learn?‚Äù Simply drives in Google or Yandex the query ‚Äúonline education‚Äù or ‚Äúe-learning‚Äù (depending on language priorities), and finds several untwisted educational platforms, each of which is attractive in its own way. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/96b/348/11f/96b34811fac04637958fcab18487bce7.jpg"><br><br>  E-learning has become the trend of the first decade of the XXI century - the volume of the world market reached $ 91 billion and by 2017 promises to grow by another 23%.

      In Russia, the e-learning-movement is also represented, but is still in its infancy.  Platforms such as Learnic and Eduson are functioning successfully, but they are primarily focused on business courses.  Aggregators of educational videos in RuNet are also available in sufficient quantities, but, as a rule, they do not have additional teaching functionality.  In this regard, the effectiveness of such a video is quite low, because it depends entirely on the student's perseverance.  But there are no unified integrated solutions with full-fledged tools for obtaining knowledge in the field of Russian online education, although the need for them is quite high. <br><br>  However, a holy place is never empty, and not so long ago, in our cultural capital, St. Petersburg, a new player appeared in this market who has every chance of occupying this promising niche. <br><br>  The educational platform EduToday lucidly and without unnecessary frills positions itself as an ‚Äúinteractive platform for the transfer of knowledge from person to person.‚Äù  And judging by the stated capabilities, analyzing the shortcomings and weaknesses of colleagues, she is able to significantly expand the existing models of training platforms, combining them in one educational structure.
