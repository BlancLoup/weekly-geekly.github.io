I worked in one Russian system integrator, where I held the double position of ‚ÄúHead of IT department‚Äù and ‚ÄúHead of IT projects‚Äù.  It was a fun time, a great team of professionals who always worked smoothly, although it wasn‚Äôt that simple.  You can enumerate for a long time the names and surnames of people who worked shoulder to shoulder with me, but I will not pass the KGB agents, I do not have such a habit. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  One day, the sun was at its zenith, and the sky was clear, the management was in a good mood, and at the next meeting it was decided to make a breakthrough project on the Russian IT market, it was 2012!  At that time, the import substitution was not yet talked about, apparently, the management understood the general vector, or maybe just a lucky combination of circumstances.  As stated in the motto of the Airborne Forces: "Nobody but us!"  This motto is in the whole integrator, especially when one of the leaders is walking down the corridor!  Thanks to the fate that I worked with such a manager, after this experience it‚Äôs not so difficult to work everywhere :)

      So with this motto and set to work!  It was decided that I would lead the project, since  on the shoulders of the head of the inventor, I can write TK, as well as have the experience of coordinated leadership of several development teams, and, of course, I can think analytically and agree in difficult situations. <br><br>  Applause is all me. <br><br>  It all started with the fact that I requested existing thin clients for testing from the main vendors: HP, Dell WYSE (T10, T50, ZXO), Kraftway Kredo, Tonk 1501, etc.  Thin clients were tested for technical and interface features for users, administrators, convenience, settings, etc. <br><br>  For testing, the software was installed on a remote server: <br><br><ul><li>  Microsoft Office (Excel, Word, PowerPoint); </li><li>  Microsoft Outlook; </li><li>  1C Enterprise; </li><li>  Microsoft Dynamics CRM; </li><li>  Microsoft Sharepoint Workspace; </li><li>  USB Network Gate; </li><li>  Microsoft Lync; </li><li>  Microsoft SQL Server 2008; </li><li>  Microsoft System Center 2012 (Software Center); </li><li>  ViPNet; </li><li>  and much more... </li></ul><br>  After the end of testing, it was decided to make our thin client on the basis of the Russian iron and stripped-down OS Linux, and that‚Äôs what happened. <br><br>  The technical task was written as "saw."  The management, colleagues, partners, many times tried to convince me that some moments do not need to be done in order to simplify.  Thank God, for this thorny path, we managed to do exactly as I wrote in the first versions of the technical assignment.  As always, everyone then forgot what they said about the reverse development of the project. <br><br>  As a result, for half a year of work, a thin client was made with the possibility of simultaneous operation in the main virtualization environments using protocols: ICA, PCoIP, RDP, x11, VNC. <br><br>  Now there are many similar devices on the market, but the story is not about that ... <br><br>  <b>At the same time, I had another idea!</b> <br><br>  Spring 2013, the first visual outline of the idea. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/783/3cc/4a4/7833cc4a45b1438bb03ee4c806625593.jpg"><br><br>  Why do we need a thin client, if we have a device in our pocket that is comparable and sometimes superior in power, with much greater possibilities than a thin client. <br><br>  All you need is a mobile phone docking station and peripherals.  Page from my presentation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e46/226/ca6/e46226ca69194cbba8e68f912571c077.jpg"><br><br>  He began to work on the idea in detail of what the Mobile Terminal Client should consist of, that he should be able to know how much money is needed for implementation, whether there are patents for such solutions.  Fortunately, there were great helpers who believed in my ideas!  All the people who met on the way were not accidental, they gave me something, I shared some ideas with them.  For this experience, many thanks to all! <br><br>  A business plan was prepared, a brief presentation, a general understanding of how much money is needed, how much specialists and time for implementation.  It should have been a dynamic SturtUp!  Started looking for money for private investors.  Many participants who met, set the tone on the Russian IT market today.  Almost everyone said something new and interesting about this project, found subtle places with sales, sales, etc.  After each meeting, I had to add or change something in the presentation and business plan.  In search of an investor, I took half a year to myself, I decided that if I could not find it, then someone would already come up with a similar project and start implementation.  I did not register the patent, before finding the finance, I already had one patent, but more on that next time. <br><br>  I did not find the money, but while I was searching, several of my mini-presentations were poisoned into the largest IT companies operating in Russia.  One of them, by a strange coincidence, is Maykrasoft.  At the time of writing the business plan, patent and filing applications for such an invention, even Microsoft did not have. <br><br>  Bottom line, I left to do other IT affairs and mentally let go of this project. <br><br>  The first in 3 years was implemented a similar project from <u><b>Microsoft</b> .</u> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/730/4a5/0da/7304a50da935442e9cd8c742e92cbe47.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7a8/cc6/4b4/7a8cc64b48564d9abecd903c6afc3aaa.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ddb/7cf/1f6/ddb7cf1f67b44fb08560fb36344ddc1e.jpg"><br><br>  Another implementation I saw the other day with a colleague "in the workshop", based on <b><u>Hewlett-Packard (HP)</u></b> . <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/59b/018/8fa/59b0188fa667481dafa0c6c88cbb8834.jpg"><br><br>  Here is a brief story on another idea that was not implemented by me.  If ideas are still interesting, which were spinning in my head many years ago, but not realized by me, I will write. <br><br>  I am sure there are many such inventors, they came up with, but could not be implemented for a number of reasons ... <br><br>  All great ideas!  :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/318812/">https://habr.com/ru/post/318812/</a></p>
