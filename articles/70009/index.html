  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Monopoly City Streets: a million lemming can't be wrong</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> In recent days <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/tag/Monopoly%2520City%2520Streets/">, many articles have already</a> been written about the game <a href="http://www.monopolycitystreets.com/">Monopoly City Streets</a> .  If you still do not know where and how much, follow the links, I will not repeat. <br><br>  As you know, an online game advertises an <a href="http://www.hasbro.com/monopoly/en_US/shop/details.cfm%3Fguid%3D7DDF7CC9-782B-1014-9A0F-DE00CF835ECE%26product_id%3D24233%26src%3Dendeca">offline board game</a> with the same name.  Its creators clearly did not expect such a stir, otherwise in their place I would have thought that they would advertise here, because much more could be earned on a virtual monopoly.  How? <br><br> <code>1.    <br> 2. ??? <br> 3. Profit</code> <br> <br>  But also, about which, oddly enough, I have never read anywhere, this game could have other great benefits on a global scale. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Egor and I sat on the couch and searched for free streets in our native Academgorodok.  There were no free streets, but on the map there were streets that cannot be bought.  They are not in the database.  ‚ÄúIt would be great if you could add streets,‚Äù said Egor.  And indeed, the game takes data about the streets (in any case, from the bottom right, so it is written) from the <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/">openstreetmap.org</a> project, and there you can add streets! 
      <br>

      We have the following scenario - on openstreetmap.org the streets are clearly marked not all and some with errors.  The data from this site, as I understand it, can be freely used in your projects.  So why not use a million greedy lemmings to fill up the street base? <br><br>  If there was such an opportunity, I would personally mark all the unmarked streets in my city with the intention of occupying them.  An experienced user will immediately indicate a possible problem, when people go to mark the left streets somewhere in the forest far away, so that no one sees.  Non-existent streets we certainly do not need.  But first, we still have a million lemmings that can not only mark the streets, but also knock on those who mark the wrong streets.  + and - similar to Habra, for example.  Secondly, for one person to put a limit of 1 street per day.  Somewhere limit the possibility of adding within large cities, so that the forests are not noted.  All principle is simple. <br><br>  At the same time, within the framework of the game, this process could go much more efficiently than adding directly to openstreetmap.org, in the end, players have something to lose if they are spotted.  And the players have an important motive - greed. <br><br>  I honestly thought that they did, but my honestly added street did not appear either immediately, or every other day, or even after a restart.  Although I specifically sat waiting for the time with the post, but suddenly it will be updated!  On the other hand, they may have frozen the base precisely because they were afraid of the millions of lemmings who would go on adding streets.  There was no need to be afraid!  It was necessary to use them for their own purposes! <br><br>  In general, the game turned out pretty boring.  You don‚Äôt have bonuses when you own neighboring streets, you‚Äôre lucky to have famous big streets (why look at other topics on Habr√©), the game is a little more than completely linear.  I see I woke up late today, but ALL the streets were already occupied.  The people must have realized and boosted their bots, now exchanging the seized streets.  In general, nifiga is not interesting and does not increase universal entropy. <br><br>  And it is a pity that the developers of such an interesting idea squeezed a percentage of 3 total. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/70009/">https://habr.com/ru/post/70009/</a></p>
