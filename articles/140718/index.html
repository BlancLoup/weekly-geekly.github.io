  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Runet Today, March 26, 2012. Experts of the issue: Pavel Cherkashin, Askar Tuganbayev</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the studio <a href="http://www.finam.fm/">“Finam FM”</a> - Pavel Cherkashin, a private investor;  Askar Tuganbaev, Director of Development of Internet Projects, CTC Media.  Together with the moderator, Maxim Spiridonov, they talk about the study, which highlights the activities of US government agencies on the Web, about a large investment in hotel booking service, the report of the Boston Consulting Group regarding the level of development of Internet business in the G20 countries, and permutations in the investor camp of the Mail.Ru Group company and on the new technology for displaying banner ads launched by Yandex. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>1. The Congressional Research Service has published a report on the use of public relations media by US government agencies.</b>  The twelve-page report states that, for the time being, government agencies have registered a total of 1,504 domain names, on which thousands of official websites have been created.  The authors of the report propose to formulate definitions of such concepts as “publicity” and “propaganda”, as well as to develop rules for the behavior of civil servants in social services. <br><br>  <i>- How do US government agencies use their social media accounts?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- The problem of erasing the boundaries between public and personal activity of civil servants in social networks.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Social media as a tool to communicate with citizens.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>"New" and "old" media.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Askar Tuganbayev: “The specificity of the United States is that their power is very much dependent on the opinion of citizens, they have a tough political struggle going on at all levels, so it’s really very important for them to provide feedback.”</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Pavel Cherkashin: “The Obama administration was the first among American presidents to master social media.</i>  <i>He, in fact, built his entire advertising campaign on this and won.</i>  <i>Now, I think they are looking at how the same experience can be applied in other areas. ”</i>

      <b>2. VTB Capital Holding together with a number of international funds invested in Oktogo hotel reservation service.</b>  This is stated in the official report on the website of the holding.  The volume of investments amounted to 10 million dollars, of which most of the invested amount accounted for "VTB Capital". <br><br>  <i>- What caused the active investment in the tourism sector of the Internet economy?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Is the online tourism industry runny in Runet?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Askar Tuganbayev: “This news looks pretty funny, because the amount is small - 10 million, but a lot of players are participating, who have tried to“ check in ”.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Pavel Cherkashin: “Tourism is one of those &lt;branches&gt; where there are a huge number of small non-centralized players who lost their efficiency due to incorrect information management.</i>  <i>Now the model is understood, how can these sources of information be combined, given directly to the consumer and earn a huge margin on this. ”</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Comment by Marina Kolesnik, Director General of the Oktogo service: “Investments will be spent on enhanced marketing, both online and offline.</i>  <i>Focus on great product, strong team and effective technology. ”</i> <br><br>  <b>3. The American company Boston Consulting Group has published a study on the level of development and prospects of the Internet economy in the countries of the “Big Twenty”.</b>  According to the report, the most Internet-oriented economy is the UK economy: the share of Internet business in the total GDP of this country is 8.3%.  In Russia, it was only 1.9%, which is close to that of Argentina and South Africa. <br><br>  <i>- How important is it for the country to focus on the Internet?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Pavel Cherkashin: “Rather, this indicator is a consequence of the indicator of economic development and the development of society, so it can be guided as an indicator of what is happening in the country”</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Askar Tuganbayev: “When accounting for the Internet industry, a bunch of different services were not taken into account.</i>  <i>E-commerce has hardly been affected.</i>  <i>We currently have Internet shops that don’t notice a lot of gray business in electronic payment systems for the economy, we have a lot of piracy, and that’s all in the shadows, too. ”</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- What is the percentage of users who are ready to give up sex and alcohol for a year, for the sake of Internet access?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- What are the prospects for the Russian Internet economy in the next four years?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- What will be the main "engine" of the Internet economy in Russia?</i> <br><br>  <b>4. One of the largest investors of Mail.Ru Group, Mikhail Vinchel, sold his 1.5% share in the authorized capital of the corporation.</b>  It is reported by the newspaper “Vedomosti” with reference to an unnamed source within the Mail.Ru Group.  The amount of the transaction, according to the same source, slightly exceeded the bar of 121 million dollars. <br><br>  <i>- What does the exit of such large and iconic shareholders from the project mean?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Future Mail.Ru Group.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Pavel Cherkashin: “Market professionals have been expecting this for a long time, and for a wide range of consumers this will not affect anything. The whole venture capital industry lives on this, you invest while the business is small, wait for it to grow, and then sell it profitably.”</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Askar Tuganbayev: “This is news for specialists. There is nothing like that, these processes have been happening for a long time, just the technical tails are now crawling out, but in fact, the release of that generation of investors took place some time ago.”</i> <br><br>  <b>5. The company “Yandex” has launched a new advertising display technology - Real Time Bidding, which allows you to place banner ads on the model of auction bidding.</b>  The sites of the Yandex advertising network act as a seller in the new service, while the buyers are advertising systems that represent the interests of advertisers.  At the moment, the new technology is in open testing mode. <br><br>  <i>- The essence of Real Time Bidding.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- The problem of loss of anonymity in the network.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Pavel Cherkashin: “With the introduction of RTB technologies, it will be possible for sites to share information on this exchange with each other, due to the fact that the unit of measurement is a person’s profile.</i>  <i>That is, information about what you like, what you don’t like, where you went, where you clicked - it forms a profile that, in fact, is put up for exchange ”.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Askar Tuganbayev: “This news revealed a long-term long struggle for user profiles. People should already understand that they are a commodity in terms of marketing.”</i> <br><br>  <a href="">Download file (38.6 MB / 56: 15 MP3, 96 kbps)</a> <br><br>  <b><i>Release on <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/id421415648">iTunes</a></i></b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/140718/">https://habr.com/ru/post/140718/</a></p>
