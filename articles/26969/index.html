  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Bad customers. How to live with them, how to fight.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> This article I do not want to write in the style of "10 rules" for working with harmful customers.  I want to describe the possible situations when working with ‚Äúabnormal‚Äù clients and how to deal with them correctly (in my opinion).  Also in the comments I will be glad to hear your additional suggestions on the strategy of behavior in such situations. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  In the article, the performer is us freelancers.  The client - in general, it is clear the customer. <br>  And so, in my practice, every 5 clients is not adequate, and often their jambs are charged to the performer.  Also, very often clients want to ‚Äúbreak through‚Äù the performer, show who is the boss, show with all of their appearance that the performer is nobody.  That is, to put it simply, not partner-friendly relations are built, but the attitude in the style of the ‚ÄúRussian Army", the soldier is nobody, the commander is our everything. In this article, I want to consider only harmful customers. Do not think that all customers are they are actually no more than 20 percent, and many manage not to face them at all. <br><br>  I will start with a few examples, I want to show who I think is a ‚Äúharmful client,‚Äù based on these examples, I will talk about possible patterns of behavior.  Also, it seems to me that without examples it is rather difficult to open a topic.

      <strong>Example one.</strong>  <strong>Timing.</strong> <br>  There is a project, the stage has come the creation of a small area of ‚Äã‚Äãa project.  To create this site need extra.  information from the client that we request from him.  The client sends the information we need on Friday, late in the evening.  On Monday morning, he calls and is outraged loudly, why he is not ready yet, that we are breaking the deadlines and trying to level the performer with the ground. <br><br>  What is wrong with the client in this situation: <br>  - Work on the weekend agreement was not.  On the contrary, it was a warning when we work (like everything from 10 to 20) on weekdays.  And at this time we are ready to do and discuss the project. <br>  - We do not mind, sometimes make an exception and work on the weekend.  However, the client did not warn that this stage of work should be completed by Monday, and from the threshold began to tear the dogs to the performer. <br><br>  <strong>An example of the second.</strong>  You did the work without initiative, without thinking at all, according to T3, and you didn‚Äôt think as best as possible / more comfortable / and so on.  I do not like the production version, because  you yourself should have guessed that there must be something else, the set and this should have realized it.  Redo everything within budget. <br><br>  What is wrong with the client in this situation: <br>  - The work was based purely on the technical task.  Which was compiled by the client (by the way, quite literate).  The client refused to offer a functional analysis, analysis of competitive products and make changes to the TK (of course, we asked for financial rewards for this service, because it takes quite a lot of time). <br>  - We initially decided that we were working within the framework of the TZ and did not make edits in the course of work (the project was programer and quite large-scale).  The client was warned about this and it was clearly spelled out in the contract.  Also in the contract it was stated that all additional functions are introduced after the closure of the development of the project according to the TOR.  To all these arguments, the client responded about not the developer‚Äôs initiative, that he did not read the contract, and so on ... <br><br>  <strong>Example number 3.</strong> Show immediately who is in the domain master. <br><br>  The potential client sends the TK and says an indicative budget.  The contractor analyzes it, and sends a list of questions.  To which the potential client sends the following answers ‚ÄúWell, what‚Äôs so incomprehensible‚Äù, ‚ÄúEverything is standard and understandable here,‚Äù ‚ÄúYes, you should know all this,‚Äù ‚ÄúLet's start the project, then discuss‚Äù and so on. To which the contractor replies that without answering these questions, we cannot calculate the budget and give our consent. The client throws a few phrases in his manner ‚Äúyes, what can I think, I have already written the budget, it suits you‚Äù, ‚Äúthis project is not worth anymore‚Äù ... <br><br>  <strong>Fourth example.</strong>  We do not like everything, return to us the prepayment. <br>  All work was done on time, according to T3 and customer requests.  When the time comes to pay for work - the client says that the performer worked poorly, he does not like the result.  Requests to return the prepayment. <br><br>  Previously, I was "breaking" under the customers.  I thought that the client is always right (in almost all manuals for freelancers - they write this), he can say his ‚Äúfi‚Äù, even if he is wrong and I should take this into account. <br><br>  For example, if we look at the first example, I have repeatedly said ‚ÄúOkeu, litter, we‚Äôll do it now‚Äù (and because of it, we had to postpone other projects, work at night ...), in the second situation, I even did a lot of extra work (not planned) within the previously agreed budget.  In the third situation, I could easily say, well, let's start and discuss all these issues later.  As for the fourth, I really returned the money a couple of times, arguing for myself with the phrase "well, and figs with him, does not give money - I will not give the project to him." <br>  As practice has shown - it didn‚Äôt bring good results.  There was little money in my pocket, my nerves were naughty.  All the following projects from a harmful client - only worsened the material and spiritual well-being.  Yes, and because of them there were shoals with projects, normal and adequate clients. <br><br>  After several such clients, I began to think that something was wrong.  I began to keep accounting records and the amount of real time spent on a particular project.  He took into account everything from telephone conversations and meetings, ending with the work itself.  After several months of keeping such records, I conducted an analysis and it became clear.  That such clients are evil, they pay the least (calculated per hour spent), because of them the schedule of work of other projects goes to hell. <br><br>  On the basis of this, I conclude, and prescribe for myself the rules of work: <br>  - all this is business and you should not give the client the will, <br>  - do not load yourself work in the load, <br>  - it‚Äôs necessary to stop feeling embarrassed to join the project‚Äôs palemic and don‚Äôt be embarrassed in requests for additional work (although in some cases I do it for free, but more on that later). <br>  - you just need to do your job well and on time (and preferably ahead of schedule).  The term I mean, not only stipulated before the start of the project.  If the term is postponed - due to the fault of the client, then in this case - I am right, the term on my part is met. <br><br>  <strong>Now the work is based on the following scheme:</strong> <br>  First, I do work without delays (I always insure in terms), I always set up unforeseen expenses in the budget (just in case), I do the work well (I‚Äôm not lazy to do things that can be omitted in principle, sometimes they are called trifles).  If suddenly the work is stopped due to delays of the client - I immediately write a letter, asking for information (so that in cases of conflict - to prove one‚Äôs case, a telephone conversation - in cases of conflict, you don‚Äôt show) <br>  As I work in the situations described above. <br>  If we take the first example, now I calmly explain to the client that this is his cant.  And that this work will take N time, for all its baseless arguments - I repeat once again, whose delay.  On provocation no longer lead. <br><br>  In the second example, everything is simple.  We refused the analysis services, which means we are doing purely technical work on p3.  Additional work - only for a fee and only after the delivery of the project (act of delivery + payment).  And even if I did not offer an analysis, there is m3 - you need to do it, the initiative is punishable.  Obvious things - naturally suggest. <br>  As for the third example, when I see that a client is harmful, I usually refuse it right away.  But no, sometimes I take it (when I want to practice negotiation tactics).  And here I act on the basis of the principles described above. <br><br>  Well, about the money back.  Now absolutely not.  I did the work according to T3 qualitatively and on time.  If I give money, yes, the client will not receive the project.  However, it will not give me anything, a lot of time I spent on the development of the project - they were wasted (in material terms).  I'm at a loss, simply because the client no longer needs the project and wants to write off his stupidity as an artist.  And this is not a business, but a casino.  If a client starts to threaten - I always meet halfway, communicating my details and addresses so that the client can fulfill his threat: send the guys, sue and so on (no one has done this yet).  And I'm not afraid of that.  I have everything documented (it‚Äôs not for nothing that I insure and duplicate all verbal agreements by mail, and sometimes I add an extra agreement to the contract), the work is done qualitatively and on time. <br><br>  <strong>With this great post I wanted to tell my freelancers:</strong> <br>  Do the work efficiently and on time, always document and insure all possible risks, both material and risks associated with the term.  And you can always keep the defense.  You cannot escape from harmful customers, they are not always able to be recognized before starting work. <br>  If you see that the client is harmful - do not touch the project, even if you urgently need money.  In fact, you will only lose them.  If you took up such a project and after its completion soberly analyze, you will understand that if this client were not, then you would have earned more money from other projects from other clients.  You would not have shoals with other orders. <br><br>  After I began to act according to the ideas described above, I began to earn much more, and also on my soul it became calmer. <br><br>  PS I'm actually very grateful to the bad customers I described above.  They taught me a lot, starting from the fact that it is necessary to work efficiently and ending with simply invaluable experience related to project management, negotiation tactics, and much more ;-) I have not received such knowledge in a single book.  Sometimes miracles happen, and harmful customers, after several heated debates, become quite normal, permanent, and beloved customers. <br><br>  PSS If this material is interesting, and its presentation is fine, then write, I have an idea to write a few more articles on the topic of freelancing, not even just write, but also discuss the following topics: ‚ÄúHarmful freelancers and how to work with them (I myself am a freelancer + I order a lot from freelancers, there are a lot of thoughts and questions on this topic) "," My personal shoals, how to recognize them, how to deal with them, and most importantly why fight them, "" Playing hide and seek.  A look on both sides of the barricade ‚Äùand others. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/26969/">https://habr.com/ru/post/26969/</a></p>
