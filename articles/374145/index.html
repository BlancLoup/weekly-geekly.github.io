  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Astronautics 2018 - overview of missions and launches</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  2018 will be an interesting year.  The great opposition of Mars, the launch of new carrier rockets, certification and possible first flight to the ISS of the Dragon and Starliner spacecraft, a telescope - the TESS planet hunter, missions to the Moon, Mars, Mercury and the Sun.  Juno will be submerged in the atmosphere of Jupiter, Dawn is buried in the orbit of Ceres, and the probes of Hayabus II and OSIRIS-REx will approach the asteroids to study and collect the regolith.  But let's start with Mars. <br><br><h2>  Mars </h2><br>  One of the main astronomical events of 2018 will be the great <a href="https://aboutspacejornal.net/2018/01/01/%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5-%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D1%258F%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5-%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D1%2581%25D0%25B0-27-%25D0%25B8%25D1%258E%25D0%25BB%25D1%258F-2018-%25D0%25B3/">opposition of</a> Mars.  This close distance is also beneficial for space travel.  So the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inspiration_Mars_Foundation">Mars Foundation Inspiration was</a> going to send two Americans on a 501 day expedition to fly around Mars.  And SpaceX planned to land <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Dragon">Red Dragon</a> on the red planet.  Both missions were supposed to fly on the SpaceX super-heavy rocket Falcon Heavy, the first launch of which was repeatedly transferred and scheduled for January 2018. Instead of Red Dragon, SpaceX will launch the Tesla Roadster on the trajectory of the passage past Mars, and nothing more is heard about the flight of Mars. <br><br><h4>  Insight </h4><br>  Instead, the previously canceled <a href="http://Insight%20">InSight</a> research mission will be held to study the internal structure and composition of the red planet.  The probe is built in the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) on the basis of the already proven design of the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D1%2581_(%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582)">Phoenix</a> landing probe.  The launch will take place on May 5 on the ULA Altas V rocket, and arrival in November 2018.

The device will investigate the origin of methane, other gases and water vapor in the atmosphere of Mars. <br>  Also TGO will perform the functions of a repeater with the future rover <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25AD%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D1%2581">Exomars 2020</a> . <br><br><h2>  Moon </h2><br><h4>  Chandrayaan 2 </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jo/g4/ez/jog4ezsfg3jjquoz-sncatqejhi.jpeg"><br><br>  In March, India plans to send its second mission to the moon - Chandrayan-2.  The mission will consist of orbital and landing devices and even a small moon rover.  Initially, the project was planned to be implemented jointly with Russia, but after the failure with <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A4%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581-%25D0%2593%25D1%2580%25D1%2583%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582">Phobos-Grunt</a> in 2011, India decided to launch the device on its own.  The launch will take place on a rocket carrier GSLV Mk II, which limits the maximum mass of the lunar mission, which will be 3.25 tons.  To achieve the lunar orbit, complex and lengthy maneuvers will be conducted.  The first Indian lunar rover will weigh only 20 kg.  and must work one lunar day. <br><br><h4>  Chang'e-4 </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/st/jd/fp/stjdfpym57jnak3w-atayfih9h4.jpeg"><br><br>  The goal of Chang'e-4 (duplication of the mission of Chang'e-3) is the first landing in history on the reverse side of the moon.  To ensure communication with the landing module in July 2018, it is planned to launch the orbital module to the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A2%25D0%25BE%25D1%2587%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8_%25D0%259B%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B0">L2</a> position of the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A2%25D0%25BE%25D1%2587%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8_%25D0%259B%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B0">L2</a> .  At the end of 2018 the launch of the landing module with a lunar rover is scheduled. <br><br><h4>  Google Lunar Xprize </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/as/6s/t4/as6st47pl7h7-casq_lwmtxdcdy.jpeg"><br><br>  In addition to the two missions of the space agencies of India and China, in 2018, the 5 finalist teams of the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Lunar_X_PRIZE">Google Lunar Xprize</a> contest are going to moonlight on the moon.  In August 2017, the end date of the competition was finally <a href="https://www.space.com/37813-google-lunar-x-prize-deadline-extended-march-2018.html">moved</a> to March 31, 2018, and the teams are at the <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/296181/">finish line</a> , but the prospects are dim. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.teamindus.in/">Team Intus</a> and Israeli <a href="http://www.spaceil.com/">SpaceIL</a> are still raising money at the start.  Japanese <a href="http://team-hakuto.jp/en/index.html">Hakuto</a> gathered to fly with the Indians and depend on their launch.  American <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_Express">Moon Express</a> depends on Electron carrier rocket, the second test launch of which was postponed to January 2018. <br><br>  International Synergy Moon will launch a launch on its own launch vehicle, which is not yet ready. <br><br><h2>  Mercury </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ov/8j/wc/ov8jwc1jt5j7mue381l__wdk7kg.jpeg"><br><br>  The joint project of the European ESA and the Japanese JAXA for the study of Mercury will consist of two satellites, with different orbits.  The launch is scheduled for October 2018 on the European launch vehicle Ariane-5, and arrival in December 2025. To save fuel, as many as 17 gravitational maneuvers around the Earth, Venus and Mercury will be performed. <br><br>  European Mercury Planetary Orbiter will study the surface and the internal structure of Mercury.  The Japanese Mercury Magnetospheric Orbiter will investigate the magnetic field and the Mercury magnetosphere. <br><br><h2>  The sun </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fn/9r/eb/fn9rebyf64nnmrybqs9i7tkcebi.jpeg"><br><br>  On July 31, 2018, the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D1%2587%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4">Solar Probe Plus</a> will be launched on the Delta IV Heavy heavy rocket - a space probe to study the solar corona from an orbit at an altitude of 8.5 times the radius of the sun.  The probe is equipped with a hexagonal shield behind which all instruments and solar panels are hidden.  Magnetic fields, formation, acceleration of particles of the solar wind and the level of energy emitted by the solar corona are going to study.  On December 19, 2024, the probe will have to reach the orbit of the Sun, for which it will perform 7 gravitational maneuvers near Venus. <br><br><h2>  ISS </h2><br><h4>  The science </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/k8/fi/lc/k8filchtvthsvsj1s9fbzdqeuxq.jpeg"><br><br>  At the end of 2018, the launch of the 25-ton Russian multifunctional laboratory module " <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259D%25D0%25B0%25D1%2583%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0_(%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D1%2583%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C_%25D0%259C%25D0%259A%25D0%25A1)">Science</a> " should take place.

And in 2018 the first flights with people should take place. <br>  Boeing plans to conduct flight tests of its CST-100 Starliner in August 2018. For SpaceX, the first demo launch of the Dragon V2 spacecraft to the ISS is scheduled for April 2018.  The first manned flights to the ISS were <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/nasa-commercial-crew-program-mission-in-sight-for-2018">postponed</a> to 2019. <br><br>  During the year, 4 manned MCs with interchangeable crews for the ISS will be launched. <br><br><h2>  Asteroids </h2><br><h4>  OSIRIS-REx </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mf/cd/qr/mfcdqrtwwtdj36ejgbpmjzqwwus.png"><br><br>  In September 2018, the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSIRIS-REx">OSIRIS-REx</a> interplanetary station will arrive at the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/(101955)_%25D0%2591%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D1%2583">Bennu</a> asteroid.  After approaching, the device will begin to map the asteroid and measure the change in its orbit depending on the heating by the Sun.  The results of the mapping will be used to select the ground location, the fence itself will be held in 2019, and return to Earth in 2023. <br><br><h4>  Hayabusa-2 </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zo/tb/y5/zotby5fxgc_nm-zbvyp6_nobxqu.jpeg"><br><br>  The Japanese Hayabusa-2 in July 2018 will arrive at the asteroid (162173) <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/(162173)_%25D0%25A0%25D1%258E%25D0%25B3%25D1%2583">Ryugu</a> .  When approaching, it is planned to bombard the asteroid with a copper shell with a charge of explosives to form a shock crater and detect other rocks in it.  MASCOT, a small, European-made descent vehicle, will descend for a more detailed survey.  Like OSIRIS-REx, Hayabusa-2 will have to deliver a sample of rocks from the surface of the asteroid to Earth. <br><br><h4>  New horizons </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qo/6r/mz/qo6rmzwcv36wp2krabxqbowuig8.jpeg"><br><br>  Launched in 2006, the New Horizons research station, located in the Kuiper belt, in June 2018 will exit hibernation and begin to approach the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/(486958)_2014_MU69">2014 MU69</a> object, although the station will reach its minimum distance only in 2019.  2014 MU69 will be the most distant object in the solar system, which will visit the spacecraft created by people. <br><br><h4>  Juno </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sr/cv/sc/srcvscov-ng9w4nl17uau-jk4vm.jpeg"><br><br>  The fate of the grand <a href="https://indicator.ru/article/2017/09/15/cassini-huygens-itogi-missii/">finale of</a> Cassini in 2017 will be repeated by <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25AE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0_(%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582)">Juno</a> (Jupiter Polar Orbiter) in 2018.
