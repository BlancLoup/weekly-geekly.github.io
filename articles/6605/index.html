  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Finetune - anti-iTunes</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Nowadays, the music site is becoming more inventive.  If you want to look at the most advanced music service, that in terms of design, that in terms of business models, then visit the website <a href="http://www.finetune.com/">Finetune</a> .  This service without loud words was launched last fall and gathered about 700,000 listeners, of whom 15% are highly active and have created more than 100,000 public playlists.  Last night, they made <a href="http://www.finetune.com/desktop/">Finetune Desktop</a> , a small desktop application based on Adobe's new application development environment - Apollo.  First you have to <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/downloads/apolloruntime.html">download Apollo</a> , and then Finetune Desktop Player, which will allow you to listen to your own playlists without having to keep the browser page open with the Finetune site.  Finetune Desktop also saves the songs you listened to and imported to iTunes, which will later help generate recommendations and various playlists to your tastes. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Another nice feature of Finetune is the ability to add widgets that share your playlists to your blog or MySpace page (there are now about 30,000 such widgets). <br><br>  Finetune is somewhere between online radio and a full-featured music subscription service, like Rhapsody.  Finetune, as well as other similar services ( <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/company/lastfm/">Last.fm</a> , <a href="http://www.pandora.com/">Pandora</a> , etc.), based on your preferences, offers performers unknown to you.  That's what the CEO, Martin Kay, says: <br><blockquote>  Until now, the tracks on the web were distributed either for free, or for a fee, or downloaded by subscription.  We realized that there was no option with advertising!  There are a bunch of other companies that are trying to sell music or support downloading music through advertising.  It's complicated.  Traditional (non-online) radio is an area with $ 20 billion.  Why not transfer them to the network? </blockquote><br>  Thinking of competing Last.fm and Pandora, Kay added that "we provide not only music radio."  Those free services create personalized Internet radio stations, but users cannot create their own, special playlists.  With Rhapsody, you can listen to any tracks, but you will have to pay 15-20 dollars a month for such privileges. <br><br>  Finetune offers a happy medium.  With it, you can create your own playlists by selecting songs from a database containing 2 million tracks (for comparison, there are more than 5 million tracks in the iTunes Store).  Finetune then randomly shuffles songs.  But as long as you have less than 45 songs in the playlist, you can listen to any song you want.

      The reason for the difference between music services is the reduction of disputes over licensing agreements with music companies.  Services such as Last.fm and Pandora pay fees of 1 cent per user every hour.  Rhapsody, which provides custom tracks, pays about 15 cents per hour for each user, as Kay says.  His compromise solution, which allows users to listen to the music that they have chosen, but in a chaotic manner, costs him a few cents an hour per listener. <br><br>  Kay plans to introduce audio advertising into the music broadcast, as is now done in traditional radio stations.  He also plans to make money selling tracks, ringtones and concert tickets.  But first he wants to discover the right sales model.  Kay says: <br><blockquote>  We believe that people will buy music, but today's music sales model is not perfect.  iTunes has grown old.  Once you buy several records, but how do you know what else you need to listen to? </blockquote><br>  Anyone who answers this question will be able to save the music industry. <br><br>  via <a href="http://blogs.business2.com/business2blog/2007/04/post.html">The Next Web</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/6605/">https://habr.com/ru/post/6605/</a></p>
