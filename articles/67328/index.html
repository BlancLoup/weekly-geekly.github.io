I just want to show you that you do not need a beautiful office and all that to start a business.  A large number of people began with a student room and a bedroom with a simple laptop in hand. <br><br>  Some of the images that you see here are a little doubtful, but remember, 11 years ago we didn‚Äôt have the clever digital cameras that we have today. <br><br>  So:

Later, he still agreed to the 240 millionth offer, giving Microsoft a 1.6% piece on Facebook, the price of which rose to 15 billion dollars. <br><br><img src="http://theifish.blogoda.ru/p/124084612.jpg" width="200" height="200" alt="Facebook"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  2) google </h3><br>  <strong>Founders:</strong> Larry Page (Larry Page) and Sergey Brin (Sergey Brin) <br>  <strong>Ground of base:</strong> garage <br>  <strong>Website:</strong> <a href="http://google.com/" rel="nofollow">http://google.com</a> <br>  At first, Lari and Sergey called their startup BackRub (back massage?), But soon decided that the search engine BackRub should change its name.  After a small brainstorming session, they settled on Google, based on the word ‚Äúgoogol,‚Äù a mathematical term for the number 1 with 100 zeros after.  The use of this term reflects their mission to put in order an infinite amount of information on the web. <br><br><img src="http://theifish.blogoda.ru/p/913928402.jpg" width="286" height="158" alt="Google"><br><br><h3>  3) Runescape </h3><br>  <strong>Founder:</strong> Andrew Gower (Andrew Gower) <br>  <strong>Place of foundation:</strong> in the bedroom of his parents in a house in Nottingham (Nottingham) <br>  <strong>Website:</strong> <a href="http://runescape.com/" rel="nofollow">http://runescape.com</a> <br>  He was interested in programming for games since childhood.

He chose Digg because users can dig up stories, unlike those on the front page of news media.  The site was named ‚ÄúDigg‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúDig‚Äù because the domain ‚Äúdig.com‚Äù was already registered with the Disney Internet Group. <br><br><img src="http://theifish.blogoda.ru/p/562157143.jpg" width="500" height="377" alt="Digg"><br><br><h3>  8) PlentyOfFish </h3><br>  <strong>Founder:</strong> Markus Frind (Markus Frind) <br>  <strong>Place of establishment:</strong> his office <br>  <strong>Website:</strong> <a href="http://plentyoffish.com/" rel="nofollow">http://plentyoffish.com</a> <br>  Back in 2001, after his birthday, someone in the office showed him an online dating service.  He went back to his place and looked at the udate.com and kiss.com sites.  He was sad and he wanted to talk to people.
