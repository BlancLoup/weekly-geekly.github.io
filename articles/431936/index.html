We have ten winners in ten different categories, and we are ready to share all the details. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8r/rq/5s/8rrq5s1p8blskoq5efhrg8f3jx8.jpeg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  But first, a few words about the contest itself for those who found out about it just now.  <a href="https://contenting.io/challenge.html">TechnoText</a> is our ‚Äúfirst attempt at <a href="https://contenting.io/challenge.html">writing</a> .‚Äù  Authors of articles on IT and technology in general could participate in it, and we didn‚Äôt limit ourselves only to publications on Habr√©.  The competition could submit work published in other sites or corporate media.  The only framework that we outlined is the publication date: the articles submitted should have been published no earlier than January 2017 - as well as the ban on submitting translations and collective creativity.  And now to the details. <br><br><h2>  What we evaluated </h2><br>  We approached the estimates comprehensively.  The most important criteria were the relevance of the topic and the depth of technical study.  We also paid attention to the conciseness of presentation and presentation (writing style, design), but with slightly smaller coefficients.

      We have distributed the bulk of the articles into previously announced nominations, the full list of which can be found on the <a href="https://contenting.io/challenge.html">contest page</a> .  However, approximately 20% of the submitted materials did not fit into them.  And since after the formation of the short list, some of the main nominations were left without applicants, we added two new ones so as not to reduce the number of winners.  They are "Hotheads" and "Technology." <br><br><h2>  How much work was sent </h2><br>  Despite the fact that the collection of applications was very limited in time, in nine days we received 55 articles, or, more precisely, references to them.  Accordingly, the participants were also 55. After the preliminary selection, a short list was formed, in which 33 materials remained. <br><br><h2>  Who is the jury </h2><br>  The main jury consisted of employees of the Habra content studio, all of them were IT journalists with many years of experience.  We also invited two experts who are well known to our community.  These are Oleg Chirukhin (@ <a href="https://habr.com/users/olegchir/">olegchir</a> ) from JUG.ru and Mikhail Bode (@ <a href="https://habr.com/users/MBode/">MBode</a> ), the creator of <a href="https://gzom.ru/">Gzom.ru.</a> <br><br>  Each member of the jury gave their scores in the shortlist protocol, and the final winners were determined by a general discussion. <br><br>  It was quite difficult to make the final choice, especially in the nomination ‚ÄúProgramming‚Äù, according to which there were as many as nine works in the shortlist.  All of them were very decent level. <br><br><h2>  Winners and awards </h2><br>  The most important thing is that we have already awarded most of the winners by inviting them to our conference <a href="https://contenting.io/">Contenting</a> last Thursday for this purpose. <br><br>  So the winners. <br><br>  <b>Marat Sibgatulin (@ <a href="https://habr.com/users/eucariot/">eucariot</a> )</b> <br>  Nomination: "Administration" <br>  Work: " <a href="http://linkmeup.ru/blog/312.html">Networks for the smallest.
