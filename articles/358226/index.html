But newsmakers were, and in today's digest we will tell about why users are dissatisfied with online banking, where bitcoins for $ 10 billion are stored and how much Xiaomi can estimate when entering <s>ICO</s> IPO. <br><br>  First about banking.  According to a JD Power survey, approximately 30% of surveyed customers of US banks work with them only through online channels.  This is mobile and online banking.  And just among these customers are most of all those who are dissatisfied with the quality of service from the bank. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gm/lf/75/gmlf75glrry1kxgdmaqtq54-lvo.jpeg">

      Among those customers who communicate with representatives of the bank personally, visiting branches, there are significantly less dissatisfied.  And here's the paradox - ‚Äúdigital‚Äù users for some reason express discontent with the lack of ‚Äúhumanity‚Äù in online services (it is understood, apparently, that there is no one to talk to if necessary).  Who would have thought‚Ä¶ <br><br>  A few days ago the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-09/bunkers-for-the-wealthy-are-said-to-hoard-10-billion-of-bitcoin">news appeared</a> in the network that the cryptocurrency startup Haro, the equipment of which is located in a special bunker in the mountains of Switzerland, already stores about 7% of the total bitcoin produced today. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/afd/14c/d59/afd14cd595ff06c88cb87e119bc05bf3.png"><br><br>  At the current exchange rate, this is about $ 10 billion. The size of a start-up deposit is greater than the amount held in 98% of US bank accounts.  And this cold repository, as far as you can understand, an online hacking of a startup with the aim of withdrawing funds is simply impossible.  And the protection system in the bunker itself is very reliable.  For example, fingerprint scanners here are equipped with pulse sensors in order to eliminate the possibility of using severed fingers or their impressions. <br><br>  In Russia, meanwhile, decided on the status of Bitcoin.  He was recognized as property during a bankruptcy court hearing.  The debtor, Ilya Tsarkov, owed money to Alexey Leonov.  But then the debtor declared himself bankrupt, saying that he had no means to pay the debt.  However, he has 0.2 bitcoin for a total of $ 1.8 thousand at the current exchange rate.  The amount is insignificant, but a court decision may have an impact on the entire cryptocurrency segment in the Russian Federation. <br><br>  A manufacturer of smartphones from China, the company Xiaomi has applied for an initial public offering of its shares on the Hong Kong stock exchange.  The startup, which was founded eight years ago by ex-employees of Google and Motorola, can now attract about $ 10 billion on the stock exchange. At the same time, investors estimate the company at $ 100 billion. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-a/uk/jz/-aukjzfiigy96jjwsytlz4hwej8.jpeg"><br><br>  The placement of shares will be conducted through the mediation of financial consultants represented by Chinese company Citic and US banks Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.  An IPO is planned for this year, unfortunately, the exact dates are not reported.  If everything turns out as analysts predict, the Xiaomi IPO will be the largest this year. <br><br>  And by the way, now many are trying to get rid of paper money and work only with electronic money.  Sweden has achieved great success in this regard.  In particular, now only about 2% of transactions in this country are made with cash.  Analysts at Capgemini BNP Paribas claim that by 2020 this share will drop to 1%.  It seems that everything is fine, but the head of the Central Bank of Sweden, Stefan Ingves, <a href="https://www.thelocal.se/20180306/opinion-sweden-needs-change-to-stop-cashless-future-creating-problems-in-time-of-crisis">states</a> that due to the massive use of cashless payments, the country is in danger - in case of the next financial crisis, there can be huge problems.  The fact is that during periods of crisis, the population is always stored in cash, because they are guaranteed by the state.  And if there is no cash, then there will be no stability. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/358226/">https://habr.com/ru/post/358226/</a></p>
