How I went from freelance to chief designer for the year</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d78/a3a/8f9/d78a3a8f95e44404baef8754538e1807.png"><br><br>  The first time I liked the rhythm of life freelancer.  But after the next project, which I forgot, as soon as I received the money, I wanted to change something in my work.  I wrote out my skills, aspirations and chose a new path for myself.  I wanted not only to receive money, but also to do something meaningful.  It was at that moment that I decided at the time to refuse future orders and prepared a step-by-step plan for achieving the goal - to become the chief product designer. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Start </h3><br>  Not having a decent portfolio, I managed to receive a new order several times a month.  Clients were satisfied with my insignificant experience, but it was not enough to work on a serious product.  On a piece of paper, I sketched the following plan for achieving the goal: <br><br>  <b>1. Implement three good design tasks.</b> <br>  Not all the work done on freelancing, I could place in the portfolio.  Some of them were made in a hurry, others I no longer like after editing the customer.  These three works were supposed to be an outlet for me from the whole routine.

      <b>2. Prepare a portfolio</b> <br>  I decided to use third-party resources (Behance, Dribbble) and not to waste energy on creating my site.  It helped me save extra money and time. <br><br>  <b>3. Find a job</b> <br>  It should have been updated profiles on hh.ru and linkedin.com.  In fact, I updated them immediately, but the profiles were completed only after the placement of works. <br><br><h3>  Development </h3><br>  I was well aware that the only way to improve design skills was practice.  Since I have limited the timeline for achieving the goal to two months, I began to look for ways to accelerate development.  And this method was found. <br><br>  At the UX-Wednesday conference, I met the founder of the <a href="https://tilda.cc/ru/">Tilda Publishing</a> service.  I liked the service.  Studying the site, I came across his design course and, after reading a few introductory lessons, I acquired it.  This course has helped me to accelerate the development several times.  It cost a decent amount for a young designer (8000‚ÇΩ), but I understood perfectly well that in the future it will pay off several times. <br><br>  I purchased a course and prepared a daily development plan: <br>  - at least 5 hours of design practice per day; <br>  - at least one topic from the course per day (+ synopsis). <br><br>  Sensible theory + practice gave the result very quickly. <br><br>  <b>Work searches</b> <br><br>  Having completed the first two points, I began to receive job offers almost every day.  Not one of them did not interest me much.  Most companies wanted to find a simple artist, while I wanted to influence the product.  Therefore, I turned to the list of contacts on Facebook and remembered a former colleague who is developing a promising company. <br><br>  I went to the company's website and realized that from the moment I left, the design had not progressed at all, although it was a decent amount of time.  ‚ÄúHere it is a chance‚Äù - I thought and suggested updating the site design as a test task. <br><br>  <b>Cognitive Story # 1</b> <br><br>  The site is really outdated, and my idea was put forward for discussion, but after a few days I still got a refusal with reference to the lack of resources.  I was surprised, but I did not stop the work on the site and showed my results at the end of the week.  The quality of work forced the director to reconsider his decision and I was offered the job of a UX designer. <br><br><h3>  Job </h3><br>  I was designing interfaces.  It was decided to transfer the design of the visual part to a third-party studio, which hurt my pride.  In addition, it was a long and expensive.  The director was on good terms with the staff of that studio, so my arguments were rejected, and I agreed to do my part.  But the designer ego made itself felt, and I changed something. <br><br>  <b>Cognitive Story # 2</b> <br><br>  I, as promised, thought out, designed the interface and gave it to the director.  But besides this, I brought the visual part to such a level that it became not only unprofitable, but senseless to donate materials to an outsourcing.  My work spoke for itself, and the question with a third-party studio was dropped.  In addition to restoring pride, I grew up in the eyes of colleagues and a month later I took the place of the chief product designer. <br><br><h3>  What helped me achieve the desired </h3><br>  <b>Purpose and plan</b> <br><br>  As you remember, I used to think on paper.  I think that writing a goal and a plan is very important.  I used to use a notebook for large-scale purposes, but with the advent of the <a href="https://smartprogress.do/"><b>SmartProgress</b></a> goal achievement service, this need was gone. <br><br> <a href="https://smartprogress.do/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/623/b96/75d/623b9675d4be4ad69974a661aae30321.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  <b>activity</b> <br><br>  Not reports, but the atmosphere of conferences contributes to development.  You enter the community of professionals and begin to listen to the conversation.  Little by little they will start to notice you and ask for an opinion. <br><br>  Conferences are useful contacts.  I met them with the head of the Mail.Ru Group design team, Yuri Vetrov, the founder of Statsbot startup Artem Keidunov, the main designer at Badoo (previously VKontakte) Pavel Shumakov and many others. <br><br>  Conferences are an opportunity to stay "in the subject."  It was at the conference that I first learned about the Sketch design tool, when few people heard about it, and for about two years I have been working only in it. <br><br>  <b>Books</b> <br><br>  I read <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/smartprogress/blog/312726/">many books</a> , but after thinking about which books helped me become a chief designer, I highlighted the following: <br><br>  <a href="https://www.alpinabook.ru/catalog/Ne_chitatel_a_pisatel/7785/%3Fav%3D1">‚ÄúHow to write well‚Äù - William Zinser</a> <br>  Most people underestimate writing skills, although we now communicate more in writing.  We write letters to employers, colleagues, and each letter forms ideas about us as an individual and professional. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.mann-ivanov-ferber.ru/books/paperbook/steal-artist/">‚ÄúSteal as an artist‚Äù - Cleon Austin</a> <br>  I stumbled upon this book in a book on Tverskaya.  She was in English, but, standing at the shelf, I swallowed it almost completely.  Austin Cleon briefly and very convincingly presents the 10 commandments of the creative person. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.alpinabook.ru/catalog/StartupsInnovativeEntrepreneurship/8830/%3Fav%3D1">‚ÄúBusiness from scratch‚Äù - Eric Rees</a> <br>  Eric Rees, using his own company as an example, tells how to test ideas, make changes to a product and, most importantly, make money on it.  This book has saved me from perfectionism when creating the first versions of the product. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.mann-ivanov-ferber.ru/books/nomer_odin/">‚ÄúNumber 1. How to become the best in what you do‚Äù - Igor Mann</a> <br>  I always recommend this book, since it was from it that I started my path of active self-development.  Igor Mann, in a manner peculiar to him, presents a clear scheme of personal development applicable in almost any industry. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.alpinabook.ru/catalog/StartupsInnovativeEntrepreneurship/8564/%3Fav%3D1">‚ÄúDevelopment of Value Proposals‚Äù - Alexander Osterwalder</a> <br>  An excellent book that forms in your head an understanding of how a business works.  This skill is important to anyone who wants to influence the development of the company.  The book is based on the business model of Alexander Ostervalder, by filling in which you can learn a lot about your company and find problem areas. <br><br><h3>  Conclusion </h3><br>  During my short career, I became convinced that finding a decent job is not difficult.  Even while studying at the institute, I managed to work as a web developer, a writer in a men's magazine and a designer.  From the beginning of my acquaintance with the new topic to the first profit, it took me no more than six months. <br><br>  I tried various activities and in the end I realized what kind of pleasure it gives me.  It took several years.  Maybe with time I will once again change the type of my activity.  I do not know that, but I know from personal experience that this is possible. <br><br>  I am sure that in our community there are hundreds or even thousands of similar stories.  Share your experience in achieving your goals in the comments.  It will be useful to all. <br><br>  Thanks for attention! <br><br>  <i>PS If you do not have an account in Habr√©, you can express your opinion on <a href="http://smarttalks.club/ru/freelance-to-head-of-design/">this article in our blog - SmartTalks</a></i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/315106/">https://habr.com/ru/post/315106/</a></p>
