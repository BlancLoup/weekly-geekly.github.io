I made sure of this more than once and decided to write a small manual so that anyone who reads it can easily make a really bad site. <br>  There are many effective ways to get a visitor from the moment he arrives at your site until the moment he runs away from him.  In this article, I stopped at 28 ways that you should definitely consider when creating a site that no visitor will ever return to. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  The first impression is the worse the better. </h1><ul><li>  <strong>M-e-e-load.</strong>  There is nothing better than watching the download bar.  Install the site on the antediluvian server and fill the pages with millions of useless images. </li><li>  <strong>"Sign in".</strong>  Make sure that when you click on the link leading to your site, the visitor gets to the main page, on which there would be a single inscription - ‚ÄúLogin to the site‚Äù.  The more times a visitor has to click the mouse to get the necessary information, the better. </li><li>  <strong>Add music.</strong>  Everyone in the world loves the same musical trends as you, so feel free to add to your site more of your favorite music, which should be constantly played in the background.  The most important thing is not to allow visitors to pause it, and even more so turn it off. </li><li>  <strong>Change user browser.</strong>  Disable unnecessary panels in his browser, and generally change the size of the window.  We after all know better how it should look! </li><li>  <strong>Popup windows.</strong>  To attract attention, there is nothing better than the good old pop-up window.  And if the visitor does not want to buy goods from the first pop-up, then he will certainly want the goods from the second!  Consequently, pop-up windows should be as large as possible. </li></ul><br><h1>  Scary design - our everything </h1><ul><li>  <strong>Complicated design, so it was not clear what is where.</strong>  Complicate it as much as possible so that the visitor could not even theoretically find out why he came.  The more information columns, the better. </li><li>  <strong>Vdarim eyes neon!</strong>  Surprisingly, how bright green text looks on a bright pink background.  Be sure to try, your visitors will love it! </li><li>  <strong>The cap should not fit on the screen.</strong>  Why do people come to you?  Correctly, to look at the beautiful hat of your site.  Therefore, make it at least 500 pikes in height. </li><li>  <strong>Embossed logo with a shadow.</strong>  When creating a logo, be sure to use the most popular Protoshop text effects - add relief and drop shadow.  The font is only Comic Sans! </li><li>  <strong>Show your ad collection.</strong>  More columns and rows of flashing animated ads.  All free space on the page must be filled with it.  And also dilute the usual text with contextual advertising, properly disguising it.  That will be a laugh when a visitor clicks on one of these links! </li><li>  <strong>Don't forget the blinking text.</strong>  The visitor will remember the good old days and will weep when he sees that you have not forgotten the html tags of the last century. </li><li>  <strong>Only tables.</strong>  Forget CSS, well, who needs it?  Make the site only on tables using the font tag. </li><li>  <strong>More colors.</strong>  Whether they harmonize or not is not important.  The main thing to make a rainbow on the site.  And this will help you Skittles. </li><li>  <strong>Gif-animation.</strong>  Firstly, it slows down the download speed, secondly, it distracts visitors from the information they need, and thirdly, a little bit of cartoony on our serious website is so cute. </li><li>  <strong>Small text size.</strong>  If the visitor wants readable text, let him go to the library.  On your website, the font should be so small that it can be read only by pressing its nose to the monitor. </li><li>  <strong>Use at least five different fonts.</strong>  Size, font, style - use everything to decorate the text.  Use non-standard downloadable fonts, the user will only thank you for it. </li><li>  <strong>Each page has its own design.</strong>  Each page should look different, and for each page there should be several style files (if you still decide to use CSS).  Be creative when creating a unique page design (do not forget to look through Kandinsky's album before this). </li><li>  <strong>Horizontal scrolling.</strong>  Yes, everyone loves horizontal scrolling!  Tear the layout with wide pictures and tables of 200 percent width. </li><li>  <strong>Cross-browser compatibility is evil!</strong>  The site should work only in one browser.  And the point. </li></ul><br><h1>  Content?  What is it? </h1><ul><li>  <strong>Studied at school?</strong>  <strong>Forget it!</strong>  Do not use capital letters at the beginning of attachments, punctuation marks and other loud speakers) who needs that payt)))) By the way, you can also use the bracelets at the end of attachments)))))))) !!! </li><li>  <strong>The text should be unreadable.</strong>  Text formatting is not for us.  Paragraphs, lists, digital designations of subtitles - all this is superfluous.  The text should go a continuous stream.  If a visitor has lost the place where he read, then these are his problems, let him bring up attentiveness in him! </li><li>  <strong>"I will not be brief."</strong>  Hide key information deeper.  In order to find out what you are doing or what services your company offers, the visitor must read the entire page.  This will either make visitors stay on the site longer, or make them leave immediately (we are actually pursuing this). </li></ul><br><h1>  Go away and don't come back! <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7e4/c29/d87/7e4c29d878b94be4d5999f5146a36568.gif" alt="image"></h1><ul><li>  <strong>Professionalism?</strong>  <strong>This is not about us.</strong>  Nothing should be or look professional - neither the site nor your actions.  Fool around on health. </li><li>  <strong>Do not pay attention to visitors.</strong>  Just ignore them.  Do not respond to their emails or any other attempts to contact you.  Better yet, remove any contact information from the site. </li><li>  <strong>Complicate the navigation.</strong>  Confuse the menu as much as possible.  Let it refers to non-existent sections or pages.  And by clicking the link "Services", the client will get, say, the page "My kindergarten photos."  In any case, your photo, where you sit on the pot, is much more fun than the dull price lists. </li><li>  <strong>The visitor must be bored.</strong>  You are not required to give visitors the information for which they came.  The site should not contain any useful information. </li><li>  <strong>‚ÄúRegister first!‚Äù</strong> Some people think that registration will force people to return to your site in the future.  This is not true.  That is why enter the mandatory registration (and the captcha should be read from the third time, not earlier). </li><li>  <strong>Never update the site</strong> .  The site must contain information a year ago.  And no hot news. </li></ul><br>  In general, there are many ways to make a bad site.  And if you have your own secret ways - feel free to add them! <br>  <em>Well, if you suddenly want to make a good site, then just do the opposite :)</em>
