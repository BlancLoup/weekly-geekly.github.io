We want to share experience with myTarget, tell what came of it and warn others.  We hope that our case will help someone to save time, money and nerves. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Disclaimer</b>  In general, we would call the experience with myTarget positive.  But if everything went well, this article would hardly have appeared. <br><br>  <b>Chronology of events:</b> <br>  On July 7, we launched test advertising campaigns, hoping that we would be able to track ads with low clickability in real time.  If the campaign is already run-in, we can predict user reaction and approximate efficiency, since we have already eliminated bad ads and optimized ad scripts.  For new campaigns, almost every minute tracking is essential. <br>  Within 2 hours, the statistics service said that no ads were shown once.  We wrote to the support service with a question about the possible reasons for such a strange behavior of the service. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/68a/e00/37b/68ae0037b28444efab99f0d68f296773.jpg"><br>  After 3 hours, support finally answered. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/84a/eb7/112/84aeb71124814cdd8f04f810864a0d07.jpg"><br>  Without waiting for the day to pass, we turned off all advertising campaigns.  It remains only to wait for the emergence of statistics to see how the ads worked and how much money was left in the account.  Someone joked that the whole budget has already unscrewed. <br>  The next day (!) Statistics became available.  As predicted, the budget went to zero, and remarketing ads were not even shown.  Gritting our hearts, we wrote in support again. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/283/92c/e7c/28392ce7cf1f422fbf7ca417de5917e2.jpg"><br>  The support service in Alexey‚Äôs face was cold - we got three lines from which it became clear that nothing terrible had happened.  Alex did not even try to hide behind servers. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/316/f66/b8b/316f66b8bca2496e8b51b26e05c588b1.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/043/f5d/59e/043f5d59e27044d5aff26508b9bd2287.jpg"><br>  After this, myTarget technical support was completely silent.

      <b>And how was it over?</b>  As you have already guessed, we have lost client money irretrievably, but we cannot refuse to use the system.  I had to replenish the account and renew advertising campaigns.  Statistics (so as not to jinx it) is working normally, without daily delays.  But this story has an open ending.  After all, no one can know on which of his accounts the servers suddenly stop coping with the load. <br><br>  The most valuable thing in digital advertising is that it can be moderated in real time, based on the observed results.  If this is not possible, then how does digital differ from subway flyers? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/292694/">https://habr.com/ru/post/292694/</a></p>
