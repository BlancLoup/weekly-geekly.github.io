  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Service to find similar people</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Imagine the situation.  You saw a young lady somewhere on the Internet, and you liked her very much.  If to speak more precisely - actually, you liked her appearance: at least, you do not know her smell, therefore you don‚Äôt know anything about her <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_histocompatibility_complex">MHC</a> - but from a biological point of view, <a href="http://asena.livejournal.com/116264.html">oh, how important it is</a> (here‚Äôs another <a href="http://www.5-tv.ru/programs/broadcast/504486/">video</a> ).  And, let's face it, in addition to the appearance and the MHC there will be other criteria that ultimately determine how much you really need it.  And nevertheless, the appearance did not seem to you to be just good, but perfect - perhaps you even once saw some kind of young lady similar to this one, and already experienced about the same feelings. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e78/411/34b/e7841134bafa4b493e9c1000693b2003.jpg" alt="The photo"><br><br>  In general, be that as it may, you really liked the appearance, but for some reason this particular girl does not suit you.  Maybe she is a superstar, and you are not very interesting to her, maybe she is married, or maybe you just don‚Äôt want to move to where she lives (you never know).  And you are wondering if she is the only one who combines all those 512 criteria of appearance that you consider to be ideal.  Actually, probably not - you have already seen such a girl before, remember?  But stop, but you don‚Äôt know her at all (maybe you saw her on the subway or on the street, but for some reason you didn‚Äôt meet her). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  And what if there was such a site?  You find a person there (after all, it‚Äôs not necessary to be a girl), and see what other people this site considers similar to him.  How does he solve this?  It seems to me that it‚Äôs worth making two layers - one is automatic, and the second is user.  With automatic everything is clear - face detection technologies are included here.  We, in principle, can with some accuracy identify people whose facial features have a certain similarity (similar eyebrows, similar lips, similar eye color).  In some form, this has already been implemented, for example, there is the <a href="http://www.pictriev.com/">PicTriev</a> site (looking for photos that have people with similar faces), and there is also a site for <a href="http://celebrity.myheritage.com/FP/Company/celebrities.php%3Flang%3DRU">searching for celebrities</a> who look like humans.  Yet this approach has obvious drawbacks - this method is rather inaccurate, and it will (at least for now) give a large number of both false positives and false negatives ( <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259E%25D1%2588%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8_%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE_%25D0%25B8_%25D0%25B2%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE_%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B0">errors of the first and second kind</a> - that is, even with the correct results, people will still often be falsely identified as similar, and falsely defined as dissimilar).  In addition, a person has not only facial features.  He has hair (they have color, some have curls, and so on), has a hairstyle that he most often wears (in many cases), has a body shape (this is a very important criterion, in actual fact), and much more  That is why I think that, in addition to automatically selecting similar people for each person in the database, there should be a selection based on data received from users.

      For example, you have a girlfriend.  You have known her for many years, and remember her appearance perfectly.  And then suddenly you see somewhere in the social network a girl who is outwardly - one to one with her.  And then you can go to this site and add a link.  If your friend is already on the site, then you go to her page, and add it there.  If it is not on the site, then you can add its page to the site simply by uploading its photo.  You can also specify a name, addresses on social networks and so on - if you want.  And you can specify later.  Or it can be done by someone else (including the girl herself). <br><br>  Probably, access to editing the pages of people should be done for everyone, because not everyone will register themselves on the site, upload a photo and indicate their data about themselves.  But, of course, you need to do it carefully from the point of view of respecting someone else‚Äôs right to privacy - of course, if someone sees his page on the site, and does not want to edit it (because previous versions will remain in the history of edits anyway), and generally remove it‚Äôs from the site, such an opportunity should also be there, otherwise it turns out to be disrespectful towards people. <br><br>  After you have created a connection (perhaps by uploading photos and filling in the data - in case some people have not been on the site before), this girl will appear in the list of similar people for your friend.  And vice versa - your girlfriend will appear in the list of similar people of this girl.  And if other people confirm that they are really similar, then the connection becomes stronger (that is, they will be displayed higher in the list of similar people from each other).  You can make a separate section on the site where you can view the links established on the site, and either confirm that they are similar, or vice versa deny it.  Thus, both links added by users and links added automatically can be ‚Äúcorrected‚Äù.  Moreover, many more things can be foreseen - for example, if a user adds different connections all the time, and they have a very good rating on average (that is, many users have confirmed that people whom this person has marked as similar really have significant similarities in appearance ), then you can initially set a good rating for this user's new links. <br><br>  In general, we get quite an interesting service.  After all, who knows how many such cases can be when we want to find people who look like some kind of person we know?  Or maybe we want to find people like us?  Or, if we are looking for actors for a film, then try to find a person who looks like some kind of celebrity who will have to appear in the film in the plot? <br><br>  If anyone is interested in joining the team - write, you can personal messages, you can e-mail.  Of course, it is still unknown what will happen in the end, but why not try it?  Something interesting might happen.  :) <br><br>  <i>Photo by Shane Barbie.</i>  <i>License <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">CC-BY-SA-3.0</a> , taken from <a href="">Wikimedia Commons</a> .</i> <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/141280/">https://habr.com/ru/post/141280/</a></p>
