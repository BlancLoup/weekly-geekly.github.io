Why is that?  It is enough to remember that the packages during installation generate the <code>.dpkg-new</code> files that <code>.dpkg-new</code> new config for the package (if the checksum of the config in the installed package differs from the checksum of the config in the system).  This circumstance should be taken into account, because otherwise you can get a new version of the software that <b>no longer works with the option you added to the config</b> , and after installing the service / application package it will simply not start.  Therefore, collecting or borrowing a package into your repository, remember that installing such a package will not update the configs itself, so, for example, if the version configs are not compatible <i>(which is relevant in the case of a more significant update than a security fix)</i> , it can be very unpleasant a situation when everything is already sleeping for a long time, and your package rolled out on a pile of servers and ‚ÄúEverything is broken, chef!‚Äù.

      Speaking of the response times of unattended upgrades packages: checking for updates and installing them on Ubuntu / Debian systems is defined in <code>/etc/cron.daily/apt</code> .  The file is launched from <code>/etc/crontab</code> , in which early morning is set by default (06:25). <br><br><h2>  Application for repository / ppa </h2><br>  Let's go to practice.  We had the following problem: one package was installed on all servers, but not in its native version, but with certain modifications.  What to do?  Obvious options: <br><br><ul><li>  ‚ÄúLet's curse one of the trainees for a few hours and let them roll out for themselves!‚Äù - this may be useful for the trainee, but only at the stage of learning how to work with the system and provided that he doesn‚Äôt know how to work apt.  Then it really turns into a curse.  In addition, the result will be more dependent on the human factor than we would like. <br><br></li><li>  ‚ÄúRoll out everywhere with Chef / Puppet / Ansible / ...!‚Äù Is a great thought, but not our case at that time and in that situation.  For the sake of one package, the dragon would have to be defeated, i.e.  set up multiple machines in the selected configuration management system. <br><br></li><li>  Since the article is devoted to unattended upgrades, it is easy to guess that it is this mechanism that offers a different way to solve the problem without spending a lot of man-hours ... </li></ul><br>  Indeed: the unattended upgrades configuration allows you to activate the automatic receipt of all updates of a package for a selected repository - for example, your own or PPA, which you have reason <b>to</b> trust <b>very much</b> .  In order for all this automagia to work at the minimum level, it is enough to create a config of <code>/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/51unattended-upgrades-custom</code> on the target machine, which will contain only three lines: <br><br><pre> <code class="hljs ruby">Unattended-Upgrade::Allowed-Origins { <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"Origin:Suite"</span></span>; };</code> </pre> <br>  If you have your own repository, then the words <code>Origin</code> and <code>Suite</code> should at least cause associations from the category "Somewhere I have already seen it ...".  I <code>*_InRelease</code> you that such parameters can be seen at the repository on the machine itself, where the package should be updated, in the <code>*_InRelease</code> file.  Illustration for well-known <code>ppa:nginx/stable</code> : <br><br><pre> <code class="bash hljs">$ head -10 /var/lib/apt/lists/ppa.launchpad.net_nginx_stable_ubuntu_dists_trusty_InRelease -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- Hash: SHA512 Origin: LP-PPA-nginx-stable Label: NGINX Stable Suite: trusty Version: 14.04 Codename: trusty Date: Sat, 11 Feb 2017 21:55:33 UTC Architectures: amd64 arm64 armhf i386 powerpc ppc64el</code> </pre> <br>  We see two parameters: <br><br><ul><li>  <code>Origin</code> - the ‚Äúorigin‚Äù of the repository, which may indicate the name of the maintainer or the repository itself; </li><li>  <code>Suite</code> - distribution branch;  for example, stable, testing for Debian or trusty, xenial for Ubuntu. </li></ul><br>  <i><b>Note</b> : For more detailed documentation on the Release / InRelease files and the parameters used in them, see <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianRepository/Format">wiki.debian.org</a> .</i> <br><br>  Thus, if you have your own package repository, you need to add these parameters.  As a result, for this PPA example, the <code>nginx/stable</code> configuration that allows unattended upgrades for all packages from it will look like this: <br><br><pre> <code class="bash hljs">Unattended-Upgrade::Allowed-Origins { <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"LP-PPA-nginx-stable:trusty"</span></span>; };</code> </pre> <br>  It is logical to automate these settings (by the method that is closest to you and / or is already used), creating all the necessary configuration files when deploying new OS installations.  And you can check how the next launch of unattended upgrades behaves as follows: <br><br><pre> <code class="bash hljs">$ unattended-upgrade -v --dry-run</code> </pre> <br>  The flags here are simple: <code>-v</code> - to be more verbose, and <code>--dry-run</code> - not to apply changes.  During the trial run, we will immediately see that this solution may have <b>reverse sides</b> : <br><br><ul><li>  If package installation requires interactivity, i.e.  user intervention (especially important if you are doing a large-scale upgrade of the system, since you have not done it for a long time) - unattended upgrades simply will not do anything. <br><br></li><li>  An example with the automatic update of nginx from PPA should not be checked in real-life production, unless you want to be seen as a ‚Äúdirty Harry‚Äù package update.  Once again, remember the name of the utility and remember that updating is only possible for something that really does not require <b>any supervision</b> .  For example, libraries (although even here there are pitfalls, if we recall at least the recent Ubuntu dances with <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/glibc/%2Bbug/1674733">libc</a> and a <a href="https://www.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-3239-1/">broken DNS resolver</a> ) and software that does not require configuration and runs on demand (atop, htop, and the like). </li></ul><br>  Another ‚Äúreverse‚Äù example, which does not even relate to the addition of specific PPAs to unattended upgrades, but which we have often encountered in practice, is a security update for PostgreSQL.  In the standard Ubuntu Server configuration (i.e., installing only security updates through unattended upgrades), automatic updating of critical vulnerabilities in this DBMS led to its <b>restart</b> at a time when not everyone expected it.  If this behavior may be unexpected (undesirable) for your case - see the <code>Package-Blacklist</code> option below. <br><br><h2>  Additional features </h2><br>  In <code>/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades</code> you can see that they can still do unattended upgrades.  There are not many settings, but some of them are useful: <br><br><ul><li>  <code>Package-Blacklist</code> - a list of packages that are not allowed to be updated in this way.  Here in the example we are immediately offered to do this for libc, and another example is described above - with PostgreSQL.  But remember that on the other side of the scale: deferring critical corrections, you <b>risk security</b> . </li><li>  <code>AutoFixInterruptedDpkg</code> - if the last installation / upgrade process failed to complete for any reason, you probably had to correct the situation manually.  This option does the same, i.e.  calls <code>dpkg --force-confold --configure -a</code> .  Please note that here the option is <code>--force-confold</code> - it means that old versions of configs will be saved if conflicts arise. </li><li>  <code>MinimalSteps</code> - perform updates with the minimum possible parts.  Allows you to interrupt the upgrade by sending SIGUSR1 to the unattended-upgrade process. </li><li>  <code>InstallOnShutdown</code> - install updates before shutting down the computer.  Personally, it seems to me a bad idea, because  I would not want to get a corpse after a planned reboot of the server. </li><li>  <code>Mail</code> and <code>MailOnlyOnError</code> - to whom to send emails about updates and / or problems with them.  Emails are sent via standard sendmail MTA (environment variable <code>SENDMAIL_BINARY</code> ).  Unfortunately, only letters, and it is impossible to perform curl to any API here. </li><li>  <code>Automatic-Reboot</code> - restart automatically after the installation is completed, if there is a <code>/var/run/reboot-required</code> file.  The file itself appears, for example, after installing the Linux kernel package, when the <code>/etc/kernel/postinst.d/update-notifier</code> rule is triggered.  In general, another option from the "dirty Harry" set. </li><li>  <code>Automatic-Reboot-Time</code> - if you want to do your dark things at night, while no one sees ... sets a specific time for automatic reloading. </li><li>  <code>Acquire::http::Dl-Limit</code> is already from the general set of parameters apt.  Limits the speed of downloading updates, so as not to clog the channel. </li></ul><br><h2>  findings </h2><br>  Unattended upgrades is an automated update installation tool built into the distributions based on Debian and Ubuntu.  It is usually used to install security updates from the corresponding repository, but it is easy to expand the application to any other repositories.  The tool will be useful for supporting easy-to-install and update programs and scripts assembled into packages - all you need to implement is the repository itself and a few lines in the config on the updated machine. <br><br>  But remember that the simplicity of the tool does not mean that you do not hit them on your fingers: do not set up automatic updates of complex or critical services if you are not 100% sure that this action is safe and this will not affect the length of sleep for you and your colleagues. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/330406/">https://habr.com/ru/post/330406/</a></p>
