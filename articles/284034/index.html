    <h4>  Trend 1 - Switch to mobile </h4><br>  This is definitely the most important and most often referred direction.  ‚ÄúWe predict that 50% of inquiries related to retail will come from smartphones (...) which is evidence of a transition from the era of a computer screen to the era of a mobile phone,‚Äù says Fashion and Luxury industry leader in Google UK. <br>  40% of respondents, including Tom Kaporaso, CEO Clarus Marketing Group, agree with this.  ‚ÄúUntil now, buyers used the mobile to search for goods only before and after the purchase itself.  Now the trend is that customers feel more comfortable paying for purchases on the website or through a mobile application, ‚Äùhe added. <br>  All e-commerce needs to be ready for this global trend.  According to analysts, mobile shopping will bring 120 billion dollars worldwide in 2015. ‚ÄúIn 2015, the share of mobile traffic will increase from 60% to 70%.  Your entire online sales strategy should be focused primarily on mobile, and then the desktop, ‚Äùsays Abbas Zakar, founder of dZine-Hub, a designer consulting store. <br><br><h4>  Trend 2 - Multichannel Approach </h4><br>  With the increasing number of buyers using mobile phones and tablets, e-commerce opens up new sales channels.  But that is not all. <br>  According to Animail experts, an increasing number of e-retailers are beginning to see the benefits of opening small offline stores.  Their presence in the shopping malls improves the quality of customer service and strengthens the brand.  Moreover, customers can pick up or return goods at such points.  Experts agree that the multi-channel approach will be distributed worldwide.  As a result, online stores that are used to working online will successfully add the traditional distribution to their portfolio. <br><br><h4>  Trend 3 - Analysis and Target Deals </h4><br>  Recent years have provided online shopping owners with a significant amount of data (traffic, behaviors, purchase history and user collection channels).  Now is the time to use this information by developing personalized offers for customers.  ‚Äú2015 will be the year when these data are no longer frightening, they are no longer incomprehensible.  Next year, marketing managers will be able to easily understand what the numbers mean, and act because the software available to them will be smarter, more intuitive and automated.  Communication strategies will finally be data driven and truly personalized, ‚Äùsays Ivan Mazur from Ometria. <br><br><h4>  Trend 4 - Free Shipping and Returns </h4><br>  Free delivery is not new to e-commerce, but only 10% of online stores in the West offer free returns.  According to experts, in 2015 this number will change.  Free delivery or exchange of goods makes buyers feel more secure, thus increasing their level of satisfaction, while the satisfied customer is more inclined to continue shopping. <br>  Another uptrend is day-to-day delivery.  This service is offered by industry giants such as Amazon, eBay and Google (Google Express), and customers are becoming more and more used to getting what they want quickly.  Remember that due to the sharp fall in oil prices, negotiations with courier companies should become easier. <br><br><h4>  Trend 5 - Effective Marketing </h4><br>  Industry analysts remind that an attractive individual offer is still the core of e-commerce.  That is why we decided to put marketing so high in our rating, speaking of it as about acquiring new customers and caring for already acquired ones. <br><br>  ‚ÄúI am constantly amazed at the number (and size) of stores that do not even fulfill the basic level of segmentation and do not set goals 1) identify their best customers and 2) serve them well,‚Äù says New York consultant Drew Sanozki.  2015 will be owned by stores that offer exactly what customers need as quickly as possible and at a reasonable price. <br><br><h4>  Trend 6 - Convenient Payment Methods </h4><br>  Innovative solutions are often used in the electronic payments sector, they all have one thing in common - the desire to be as convenient as possible for the client.  Payment solutions in one click or touch are highly desirable.  According to experts, the future belongs to universal e-wallets that do not require filling out the same forms again and again in different online stores. <br><br><h4>  Trend 7 - Individual Offer </h4><br>  Online shopping websites, apps, newsletters and other forms of online marketing will become personalized.  Even the location of the proposal should be adjusted to suit the preferences, the behavior on the site of the analyzed customer and its financial capabilities.  Adjust your best to increase your sales, mark-up and customer satisfaction. <br><br><h4>  Trend 8 - Social Media </h4><br>  We should not forget about social media when we talk about trends in 2015.  Experts highly appreciate this area and mechanisms that accurately target marketing materials and simply scale.  ‚ÄúAs soon as you give a successful announcement, allocate more funds to it in order to get more results.  Social networks allow us to segment and direct advertising in ways that were not available to us before, ‚Äùconvinces John Lawson of ColderlCE Media in his analytics for webretailer.com. <br><br><h4>  Trend 9 - User Experience </h4><br>  A well thought out and convenient buying process is essential.  This year everyone should focus on the mobile UX.  ‚ÄúWeb design will change from the desktop primarily to mobile devices.  Now we will first look at how our ad or website looks on a computer, and then we will check on a mobile phone.  There is a shift in this area, ‚Äùsays Abbas Zarkar from dZine-Hub, a company that designs templates for online stores. <br><br><h4>  Trend 10 - Marketing Content </h4><br>  Despite analyzing targeted and personalized marketing campaigns, the Internet is littered with advertising.  As a result, companies struggle to become noticed.  That is why experts recommend using marketing materials to build customer relationships.  By marketing materials they mean exciting video files that spread like a virus in social media.  Also, various guidelines and lifehacks, not to mention interesting product-related stories, will do - this can be a great trick. <br><br>  According to Dan Barker, who advises British online retailers, this strategy is crucial for smaller players who may be noticed due to their attitude or unique offer.  ‚ÄúOne of the main ways for a company to gain trust from consumers is the consistent creation of valuable content through various channels.  (...) This allows the company to consistently build relationships with its audience and develop loyalty, ‚Äùsay analysts of the Russell group. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/284034/">https://habr.com/ru/post/284034/</a></p>
