Someone knows how - but he himself cannot realize due to lack of knowledge / time.  Someone does not think about it at all, but can make a part or fully implement the idea.  The rest could benefit if they knew about it, or recommend it to others if they knew their interests / needs.  As a result, most ideas die, even without being born. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  I propose to create a website, portal or service, it is not so important what to call it.  Which will contribute to the development of ideas and projects.  Next, I will describe the step by step procedure of supporting an idea that with this support can grow to a full-fledged project, find investments and its users. <br><br><h3>  Principles </h3><br>  <em>Every idea should have a chance to live.</em> <br>  They should not die in the same head that they were born. 
      <br>

      <em>Everyone should do their own thing.</em> <br>  Regardless of who invented it, those who can do it will develop, and those who need it will use it. <br><br>  <em>Interaction between people should strive for maximum convenience.</em> <br>  Then ideological people, developers, investors and users will spend less time on communication, and more on the actual business. <br><br><h3>  How would this happen? </h3><br><h4>  Step 1. Publish the idea. </h4><br>  They invented something necessary, describe in detail what it is and why it is.  How it will work, who will need it, and how it will solve the problem.  A temporary team will be formed immediately, to which all who wish to participate in its development will later join. <br>  You can not be afraid to open your idea.  Publishing - you assign authorship to yourself.  If something like this is already there - someone will tell you about it, and you will not take the time to choose the shape of the handlebars of your bike.  If you are shown a bicycle with square wheels - your brilliant idea to make them round has the right to life! <br>  UPD: <i>Protection of the idea will be present, but will be provided in a slightly different way than copyright.</i>  <i>In the community, authorship will be recognized, and accordingly - no one will ‚Äústeal‚Äù.</i>  <i>And outside the community, the idea is implemented more slowly, respectively, you and your team will somehow become the first to implement.</i>  <i>And naturally, your authorship will remain in the history of the project.</i> <br><br><h4>  Step 2. Discussion of implementation. </h4><br>  See an interesting idea?  Do you know how to implement it at its best? <br>  Write down what technologies will fit better, what knowledge will be needed, maybe some other details about which future implementers should know in advance ... <br><br><h4>  Step 3. Implementation. </h4><br>  Will your knowledge be enough to realize a part, or maybe the whole idea? <br>  Tell me about it!  If you are interested in participating (like the idea or for the portfolio, or for other reasons) - proceed.  If you are interested in the financial side of the implementation, name the amount, and it is quite possible that someone interested in the implementation of this project will contact you. <br><br><h4>  Step 4. Investments. </h4><br>  Did you find, in your opinion, I distinguish an idea whose development hangs up unnecessarily?  Or developers are willing to work on it only for the money? <br>  You can offer financing for development, and if the author of the idea and the developers are satisfied with your conditions - the idea will live! <br><br><h4>  Step 5. Testing. </h4><br>  Do you see a project just launched, which you start using it, and see errors, or are you missing some functions? <br>  Inform the team or project developer about this.  Perhaps they have missed something important, and something can be improved and made more convenient, then they will accept your comments, or they will explain the better their implementation. <br><br><h4>  Step 6. Popularization. </h4><br>  Did you find the finished project, and did you like it? <br>  Tell about him to those whom, in your opinion, this will interest you, or solve some of his problems.  Write about it in your blog, or hang a banner on your site ... <br><br><h3>  What else? </h3><br><h4>  User profiles </h4><br>  I think that in order for all this to work effectively, each user will have to indicate in sufficient detail his interests, knowledge, skills, as well as the areas where he will be interested in developing.  Over time, a list of projects implemented by the user, both alone and in a team, will appear. <br>  Also a list of commands in which the user participates. <br><br><h4>  Teams </h4><br>  Teams can be combined from developers, testers, generators of ideas or to be combined.  They will have about the same profile as the user, with a list of completed projects, a list of interests (in which donor participation is most likely), an approximate cost for which you can hire a team for something ... <br><br><h4>  Investors </h4><br>  It will be much easier for them to choose projects for investment, when you already see the attitude to each idea, the development teams ready to work on the project, their portfolio ... <br><br><h3>  Let's try? </h3><br>  If this idea really helps to make the web better, then this can be considered the first step.  I do not know what to do next, and on which engine it is better to implement.  I can not draw.  But I can always concretize some moments, or participate ideologically.  I will be glad if she gets a start in life. <br>  Let's try the idea on it, and go through the steps to implement it.  What do you think? <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> As it turned out, there are many people with similar ideas ... It pleases.  Here they are: <br>  <a href="http://friendfeed.com/e/9a9bfc6f-3589-4cb6-8f1d-ba2335dcaa3e">A network of people who help each other realize ideas</a> , <a href="http://idea2.ru/">Idei2</a> , and a project already launched that has similar goals for <a href="http://getdone.ru/">GetDone.ru</a> . <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/53950/">https://habr.com/ru/post/53950/</a></p>
