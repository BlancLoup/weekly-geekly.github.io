      Sounds scary?  Let me explain to you.  All these technical abbreviations, like Monsters in the ‚ÄúRoom of Fear‚Äù.  Remove the mask from them, and under it will be a normal (in any case, human) face. <br><br>  Hold on to my hand, and bold, I will take you through this ‚Äúroom of fear‚Äù advertising technologies. <br><br>  <b>So what is DSP?</b> <br><br>  Demand-side platform (DSP) is software that facilitates the purchase and sale of online advertising.  This is a digital tool used by advertisers and agencies to effectively search for the best sites (inventory) for placing their advertisements, in accordance with the parameters they need. <br><br>  These parameters the advertiser (or the agency representing it) chooses from the possible.  The advertiser can sort the inventory of the publisher by segmenting the audience (by demographic parameters, interests, locations, etc.) or by type of inventory (examples: video, mobile, desktop, etc.). <br><br>  The point is that with DSP, this whole process of searching and sorting, which in the past was carried out manually and was very long and ineffective, is now done automatically with the help of a computer. <br><br>  It is faster.  It is much more efficient.  And also cheaper. <br><br>  By all measures - to win! <br><br>  <b>And what about the Mobile prefix?</b> <br><br>  Mobile DSP is designed to solve many specific tasks that the ‚Äúmobile revolution‚Äù has set.  Here are some of them: <br><br><ul><li>  Mobile users carry their phones everywhere.  To track their movement in order to deliver locally-targeted advertising on time, special technologies are required.  If done skillfully, these technologies present tremendous opportunities for personalized engagement. </li><li>  Advertising creative.  Mobile devices require that advertisements be displayed properly and look decent on the screens of various devices. </li><li>  Mobile applications.  Most users not only access the Internet and watch videos on the screens of their smartphones, but also actively use mobile applications.  Just as it is necessary to take into account the size and ratio of the screen;  different mobile applications use different sets of rules, which must also be taken into account. </li></ul><br><br>  To find mobile inventory, mobile DSP integrates with special digital platforms called ad exchanges.  This is the place where the publisher places its sites for advertising.  Our DSP is integrated with all the largest mobile advertising exchanges. <br><br>  <b>Process</b> <br><br>  After the DSP integrates with the advertising exchanges, it gets access to display ads on millions of sites across the Internet.  And besides, the process of finding and buying advertising takes milliseconds. <br><br>  How? <br><br>  All this happens through real-time auctions, in the world of digital advertising called RTB (real-time bidding). <br><br>  In this process, the DSP decides on which site is better to buy the accommodation, based on the parameters set by the advertiser, and makes a bid (bid) to determine the final price. <br><br>  <b>Implications of Mobile DSP</b> <br><br>  DSPs, especially mobile ones, are changing the whole system of buying and selling digital media.  DSP makes this process faster, more efficient, and better optimized using a wide variety of data, which is increasing every day and more accessible. <br><br>  This means that the person is no longer involved in setting the final price. <br><br>  But this is not necessarily bad. <br><br>  DSP allows ad buyers to instead plan their strategies and optimize their ad campaigns, rather than get bogged down in the routine of annoying repetitive operations. <br><br>  And this is much more interesting and productive, isn't it? <br><br> <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/register/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dcontent_marketing"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/041/3c5/29a/0413c529a1424210a02b160e54a40e80.png"></a> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg">BYYD ‚Ä¢ Mobile Advertising Platform</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/292610/">https://habr.com/ru/post/292610/</a></p>
