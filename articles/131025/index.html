I am promoting websites.  As a creative person, I can be distracted, go headlong into new ideas, and so on.  For example, now began to keep <a href="http://ifriends.ru/">your blog</a> .  But like every person, I have some basic activity that feeds me. <br><br>  Today I decided to find out what my employees are doing and I realized that they are all sitting and analyzing something. <a name="habracut"></a>

      <b>Example 1</b> <br><br>  The client's site fell out of the index, because  he was attacked, then he returned to the index, but to bad places.  I wrote a letter in Yandex, I was told that on the site "re-optimized texts", they say correct, make the texts readable for people and we will return you to the top. <br>  I called the assistant, she instructed the optimizer to do an analysis of the top, how many entries we have, how many competitors have.  He made this report, he took him 8 hours.  The optimizer receives 200 rubles per hour, so this report cost me 1600 rubles, not including electricity, rent, taxes and depreciation of equipment. <br><br>  The question is, who needs this score, who will read it?  I will not, I already see that the texts on this site are ala "Somehow SEO-specialist comes to a bar, restaurant, buy alcoholic beverages, clubs, the best bars in Moscow, order a banquet in a restaurant," I understand reports Not needed.  The report will be read by the assistant, will still climb the site, look at everything and also spend a couple of hours on it. <br><br>  And that in the end, in the end there is a report, but nothing has changed on the site.  And it was possible without a report, just spend these one and a half days to redo all the texts on the site. <br><br>  <b>Example 2</b> <br><br>  I painted a viral picture with the copyright of my blog.  I called my brother so that he could compile for me the most complete list of seo forums, blogs and websites to post it on.  2 days have passed, there is not a single site in the list, I call him, but it turns out he analyzed those 2 days sites.  Ie he can tell about each of the sites, he looked at them all, studied them, and there is not a single site in the list, so I can‚Äôt fast anywhere. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion</b> <br><br>  Today, when sorting out google docs, I realized that most of the reports are not read by anyone.  Moreover, the part is made in such a form that it is impossible to read it at all. <br><br>  When an employee sits VKontakte, plays games at work, you can fight it.  But when an employee sits all day and watches google analytics statistics, studies how visitors go around the site, watches the bounce rate, reads reports on seo conferences, then he has a full knowledge that he is doing a useful job and working.  And in fact - this is an extra way to do nothing. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/131025/">https://habr.com/ru/post/131025/</a></p>
