  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Two-layer project management model</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I would like to briefly focus on the differences between the product and the project, and more specifically, between the product development project and the actual product development.  Some articles on project management in IT in my opinion do not draw a good line between these two objects, and in fact they are in my opinion very different. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  What is it all about? </h4><br>  First and foremost, the result of the project is not only a product, and even not so much a product, as a satisfied Customer and money received from it.  Customer satisfaction is achieved by delivering a quality product on time, then the Contractor has the right to expect money.  All this is achieved by appropriate management. <br><br>  From this we can conclude that project management and product development are different categories.

    <h4>  What is the difference? </h4><br>  The difference is in the project phases and actions in these phases that are undertaken by the project manager.  All that is usually written about Agile, refers mostly to the management of the product development process, namely the process, not the project. <br><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td>  Project management </td><td>  Product development </td></tr><tr><td>  Project opening </td><td>  Drawing up contracts, charters, recruitment of project team, setting meetings, preliminary planning </td><td>  Nothing yet </td></tr><tr><td>  Project start </td><td>  Planning, organization of work, meetings </td><td>  Drafting of technical specifications, development of prototypes, collection of requirements </td></tr><tr><td>  Mid project </td><td>  Risk Management, Change Management </td><td>  Coding, Testing, Documentation </td></tr><tr><td>  Completion of the project </td><td>  Organization of acceptance </td><td>  Correction of defects from acceptance, transfer to support </td></tr><tr><td>  Project closing </td><td>  Documenting experience, both project and product </td><td>  Nothing </td></tr></tbody></table><br>  The essence can be understood from the picture, kindly borrowed from the book of S.A.  Mishina "Project Business". <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/fee1b7e6/15c21d06/d7587a69/66314baf.jpg"><br>  The life cycle of development is included in the life project.  And we can recall that the life cycle of a product includes the project life cycle (according to GOST 12207 for example).  Consequently, the quality of management determines the quality of the future life of the product. <br><br><h4>  So why all this? </h4><br>  In addition, it is the project management, not the product development process, that determines the success of the project.  Just follow, for example, Agile is not a design technology, but step by step.  The project, which includes planning, already has at least two elements of Waterfall, namely Planning and Implementation.  Why do you need planning, and why is step-by-step technology worse?  This can be illustrated by another picture from the book "Project Business". <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/71d23e53/6559a907/f4f0711a/3af31aaa.jpg"><br><br>  <b>In fact</b> , everything comes up against the definition of a project that you give to your (corporate) projects.  If this is a temporary company to achieve results (according to PMBOK), then this will be a temporary company to achieve results.  If the projects are quite similar to each other, and follow a certain technology of product development, then you can determine more accurately.  From this point of view, Agile is a product development technology, and the project management standard is separate. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  Why separate flies from cutlets at all?  Then, that project management and product development management should be separate to understand what brings us in case of failure.  For example, poor quality product is the result of bad technology, not project management.  At the same time, the low margin from the project is the result of poor project management, including possibly unsuccessful technology choices. <br><br>  In general, weigh the pros and cons when deciding <i>how to</i> develop a product.  Thank you for your attention, do not forget to write in your plans managerial activities, and good luck with your improvement! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/126332/">https://habr.com/ru/post/126332/</a></p>
