The package of shares for $ 1.2 billion in October 2015, bought the South African media holding Naspers, which collected shares of Kinnevik, Northzone, Accel, Baring Vostok and other shareholders.  As a result of the acquisition of shares, Naspers received a package of 67.5% of Avito shares, and the entire company was valued at $ 2.7 billion. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  According to the study ‚ÄúMoney Tree: Venture Market Navigator‚Äù from the Technology Center and the Russian Venture Company (RVC), the venture capital investment market amounted to 31% year-on-year, reaching $ 2.9 billion. the Oppenheimer Funds fund's exit deals from Yandex with a transaction amount of $ 190 million and the sale of Sergey Adonyev and Albert Avdolian Telconet of Yota Devices shares for $ 100 million (the transaction is still in the process of being completed).  At the same time, Intel has invested $ 100 million in the Mirantis software developer, and Alisher Usmanov has invested $ 100 million in the largest Russian eSports community. <br><br>  If you do not take into account transactions with an amount of more than $ 100 million, then the rest of the venture capital market fell by 52% compared with 2014 - just in this segment they made deals for $ 232.6 million. About 40% of transactions in 2015 were made at an early stage, and among small investments the average check of the transaction fell from $ 3.3 million to $ 1.5 million.

      The most attractive area remains information technology, in which 97 transactions took place.  The second most popular was the field of biotechnology with 39 transactions, and the third place was occupied by the area of ‚Äã‚Äãindustrial technology - 15 transactions. <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúInvestors are as cautious as possible - they invest in small amounts and not in new projects: the focus of funding has shifted to more mature projects. <br><br>  The report did not include the transactions of the Internet Initiatives Development Fund (IIDF), although they would hardly have radically changed the overall situation, ‚Äù <a href="http://www.rbc.ru/technology_and_media/24/03/2016/56f3d7a49a7947e6fc784bc5">said</a> Alexey Soloviev, managing director of the Prostor Capital fund. </blockquote><br>  For comparison, in the US venture capital market in 2015 transactions worth $ 58.8 billion were completed. In this market, the total number of transactions, the amount of which exceeded $ 100 million, was 74 against 50 a year earlier. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299674/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299674/</a></p>
