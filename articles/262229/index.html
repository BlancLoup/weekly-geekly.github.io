For obvious reasons, the load on the technical support service and developers has decreased and we decided calmly that it is called ‚Äúwithout strain‚Äù to release a new release of our cloud interface codenamed ‚ÄúVersion 3.1‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/55b/d3c/17d/55bd3c17d93944b49ec468ec3fe01129.png" alt="image"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Once having decided that AltegroCloud should become a project that provides integration of mobile communication, cloud PBX and geolocation services, we fixed in our calendar: there is no urgent need for multilevel IVR, practically no one uses voice boxes, and there are complex call processing scripts for incoming calls by operators call center - the story is long and doomed to endless competition with the already established IP-PBX, but the integration with CRM, with mobile communication, with geolocation, improved statistics - this is our all and we  We develop these options first of all, paying less attention to the telephone part.

      So, about what has been updated: <br><br>  <b>Improved API</b> <br><br>  We realized that even with a dozen of the most popular CRMs, box integration will never be enough, and half of our customers are interested in the possibility of integrating AltegroCloud with their own CRM, written for specific tasks.  After consulting and analyzing the existing requests, we decided that nothing could be done about it, it was impossible to keep up with the rapidly developing trend, which means we need to implement a public API.  What was done.  Now, in our cloud, out of the box, amoCRM, Bitrix 24 and ‚Äúalmost any-CRM-which-you-wrote-under-yourself‚Äù work.  A button appeared in our personal account, opening the way to the magical world of integrations. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/470/865/a79/470865a7937d4ef9b4a794ab9d711f10.png" alt="image"><br><br>  If with amoCRM and Bitrix everything is clear without further explanation (clicked / configured / entered the necessary parameters / started to use), then with the API the story is somewhat more complicated, but we tried to please almost everyone who once asked us about integration. <br><br>  <b>This is how it looks from the inside:</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/df2/2a5/751/df22a5751f8343478ab7dda87cbdfdfc.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Do you have your own CRM?  No problem, go to your personal account, everything is there for integration. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/298/4c4/fb7/2984c4fb79e448b8b7d28d3eac5777a6.png" alt="image"><br><br>  What happened in the end: now CRM and mobile communications are chained together - all calls from mobile employees are included in transaction statistics along with calls from office phones and you can listen to the recordings of conversations from realtor‚Äôs mobile phone Anatoly with clients directly from the transaction card.  Anatoly calls and communicates, and his manager listens and all this in one place - in the CRM interest.  Beauty and only. <br><br>  <b>Improved statistics and continue to improve</b> <br><br>  During the six months of the service‚Äôs existence, it became clear that convenient, clear statistics are simply vital for customers.  Statistics are viewed by everyone (this is a verified and confirmed thesis), and almost no one sets up multi-level voice menus in the cloud PBX (and this is also a verified thesis).  Well, they registered in the roadmap: working on statistics non-stop.  We improve and decorate. <br><br>  Now we have added a convenient graphical format for displaying call statistics in the company for any selected period.  It is clear that calls from mobile employees also fall into this very statistics, which is certainly very convenient - you get a single report on all calls, including mobile calls. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5a5/218/a5c/5a5218a5c9af443eaa207481f303d35c.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Improved integration of geolocation and mobile communications</b> <br><br>  Here is quite interesting.  Having gained access to the API service of the geolocation of the mobile operator, we realized that the service can be improved almost infinitely.  What do customers of geolocation services want?  They want to control, and control does not happen much.  It is not enough to see the employee on the map, you also need to see where he was and when, with whom he spoke on the phone and, ideally, listen to the recording of conversations.  Naturally, only when it makes sense.  And there is a sense in this for any business where mobile employees are directly responsible for business processes - couriers, delivery services and, of course, real estate agencies, in which each gone ‚Äúleft‚Äù deal is a minus big money.  We began to improve and could not stop: the scope for imagination is almost unlimited. <br><br>  This is what is right now in the sandbox, is being tested and will be available in the ‚Äúpublic‚Äù in the very near future: <br><br>  - you can set an arbitrary time interval and form a full track of the employee‚Äôs movement on the map <br>  - you can see the current location of the employee (although it was before) <br>  - it is possible, having found the employee on the map, call him, clicking the mouse on his icon - the call will be sent to our sim card <br>  - You can see the general statistics of employee calls for the selected period - how many minutes, how many missed, how many incoming and how many outgoing calls all in the geolocation interface <br>  - and, most importantly, you can see the tags of making calls on the employee's track for a selected period of time with the ability to listen to these calls.  For example, realtor Anatoly has been working ‚Äúin the fields‚Äù for a whole week and we know almost nothing about him, except that he is about to sell the Federation tower to a large foreign investor and he will call as soon as he sells.  Great, Anatoly, we went to look at the history of your travels and calls, and in what language did you communicate with this same investor. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d19/036/c15/d19036c153e44f499a32d23b064dca5f.png" alt="image"><br><br>  On the map you can see where Anatoly visited over the past three days, to whom and when he called and told about something - we can listen to the recording of each conversation right on the map.  Very convenient, the control becomes almost complete. <br><br>  Right now we are working to provide access to geodata of mobile employees and API, in other words, our customers will soon have the opportunity to integrate geodata into their own CRM, but with one of the following hubs. <br><br><habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/262229/">https://habr.com/ru/post/262229/</a></p>
