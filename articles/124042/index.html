And we once again go there, and this time we will conduct the <a href="http://www.oscon.com/oscon2011/public/schedule/detail/21144">session</a> in 40 minutes.  The exact date and time of our presentation is as follows: <br><ul><li>  <b>Date:</b> July 28th, 2011 </li><li>  <b>Location:</b> Oregon Convention Center, Portland, Oregon. </li><li>  <b>Hall:</b> E142 </li><li>  <b>Time:</b> 13:40. </li><li>  <b>Language:</b> English (questions can be asked in Russian). </li></ul><br><h4>  The topic of conversation </h4><br>  This year we will talk about <b>how to create persistent, highly-accessible web services using technology CUBRID HA</b> (High Availability).  Therefore, the presentation will mainly take place on the high availability of CUBRID. <br><br><h4>  Who should attend? </h4><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  If you are working on a service that brings or will bring you real income, it will be useful for you to come and listen to our presentation, since 100% availability of your service and distributed load balancing are most important for you, and to make it all easy to configure, maintain and also free.  Thus, in this presentation you will learn why and how CUBRID HA guarantees the eternity of your service.

      <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/cubrid/blog/117687/">CUBRID</a> [habratopic] is a complete, open source, relational database management system (DBMS) optimized for web applications.  The system is distributed as a single package, which includes both the database engine itself and the ‚Äúnative‚Äù, full-scale and reliable High Availability feature, which is the flagship feature of CUBRID. <br><br>  High Availability CUBRID is the most convenient and equipment-independent way to automatically transfer control for any failures, which also provides synchronous, asynchronous and semi-synchronous replication.  During the conference, we will tell you in a very clear and accessible language about how it all works in the CUBRID DBMS, so that you can sit down and start developing your service quickly, efficiently and, most importantly, reliably. <br><br>  At the OSCON session, we will also explain why high availability is a very important technology that you should not ignore, why you should stop wasting your financial resources on technologies that have open source counterparts, and are completely free.  Perhaps you are now paying a lot of money to Oracle to use business-level features such as synchronous replication, hot / online backup, or High Availability.  This is all you need to then manually configure so that everything works correctly with your existing Vervis.  With CUBRID - all this is available in one system for free, besides everything is automated.  We will never ask you to buy a commercial license.  We do not have it and never will.  Our project is reliably sponsored and developed by the number one leader of the Korean IT industry - NHN, which is the 13th largest Internet company in the world.  NHN saves more money on using CUBRID in its services instead of other commercial DBMSs.  Therefore, we do not pursue finance. <br><br>  At OSCON, we want to meet with company executives and tell them about why companies in Korea are massively switching to CUBRID, and how they lower their total cost of ownership using CUBRID. <br><br>  Also at the conference, we want to meet with developers and testers who are ready to try CUBRID in their projects, and could tell us about their impressions, wishes, what they would like to see in the next versions, and what needs to be corrected.  Our project is not as old as Orakl.  We have only been on the foreign market since last year, so we really need your support. <br><br>  If you have the opportunity to attend the OSCON conference, do not forget to call us at hall E142 and say ‚ÄúSalute to the CUBRID from Habrayuzer!‚Äù It will be very pleasant for us!  In addition, you can learn more about CUBRID and its High Availability features. <br><br>  PS If you are eating, let us know and we will bring you our CUBRID branded <a href="http://www.cubrid.org/my_cubrid">T-shirts</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/124042/">https://habr.com/ru/post/124042/</a></p>
