It</b> is expected that more than 5,000 IT specialists from Russia and neighboring countries will gather at the rally. <br><br>  <a href="http://sletadminov.ru/"><b>The All-Russian Meeting of System Administrators</b></a> is an annual event that brings together IT engineers, programmers, system administrators, heads of IT departments, technical support specialists, and other IT employees in the industry.  Traditionally, the rally is held in the Kaluga region, in natural hiking conditions. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

      The event has long won the love of representatives of the IT-community in Russia and the CIS, as well as system analysts from abroad.  The popularity of the rally is getting higher every year, and the number of its participants is constantly growing.  From the moment of the first meeting in 2006, its constant organizer and the main ‚Äúkeeper of traditions‚Äù is Softline, which this year celebrates its 20th anniversary. <br><br>  One of the innovations at the rally is the support of the rally sequence number by the general concept of the event.  Last year, it was the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/softline/blog/147174/">7th meeting in the ‚Äú7 Sysadmin Wonders of the World‚Äù theme</a> : the pyramid, the Semiramis Gardens, the Sysadmin terms, ‚Äúcloud skating‚Äù, the Colosseum and much more were represented on the glade.  This year the Eighth meeting of IT specialists will take place and it will be held in the style of 8-bit games - Mario, Battle City, Tetris, Pacman. <br><br>  Another new tradition is to hold a rich conference part of the rally.  In 2012, the topics of virtualization and cloud technologies were raised;  security topics and software purchases;  Brain storms were conducted on the creation of an ideal tool for accounting, monitoring and management of IT assets.  The conference was attended by representatives of Softline, Microsoft, Symantec, Red Hat, Dr.Web.  This year, given the interest in this part of the meeting from participants and companies in the IT market, the conference program will be even more intense and informative. <br><br>  As always, the participants of the event will have the opportunity to talk, discuss important issues that troubled the IT community throughout the year, spend time with like-minded people, share experiences in an informal setting and just relax in nature. <br><br>  In addition to discussions on topics relevant to the IT world, special ‚ÄúSisadmin‚Äù competitions and contests are held at the rally site, as well as an unforgettable themed entertainment program, including performances by invited rock bands, open-air discos, a traditional big bonfire, fireworks and many other interesting surprises . <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe meeting is the most large-scale IT-event of the summer.  In the upcoming event it is planned to please the participants not only with traditional contests and competitions from DSA's IT partners, but also with interesting and useful reports and master classes, ‚Äùpromises Roman Agafonov, director of Internet business development at Softline. <br><br>  We invite IT-market companies to participate in a rally and get the opportunity to directly communicate with the target audience. <br><br>  <a href="http://sletadminov.ru/reg/">Sign up</a> and get more information can be found <a href="http://www.sletadminov.ru/">on the site of the meeting</a> . <br><br>  <b>UP</b> <br>  There is only one week left to go! <br>  The event in the meadow next to the recreation center "Lavrovo-Pesochnya". <br>  How to get to the venue look <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps/ms%3Fmsid%3D211261945785522324530.0004def69d7962b7cb0e8%26msa%3D0">here</a> . <br>  Confirmed speakers and topics appeared.
