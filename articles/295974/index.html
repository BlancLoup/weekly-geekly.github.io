  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Chinese and Russian Internet retailers: friendship - friendship, and money - apart</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Judging by the research of the marketing company Nielsen, the market for Chinese e-commerce reached $ 2 trillion in 2014.  The Russian e-commerce market, given active growth, this year will at best be able to reach a volume of $ 13 billion. <br><br>  At the end of 2014, China ranked first in retail turnover in the global online commerce, <a href="http://www.ng.ru/economics/2015-11-02/4_china.html">cites</a> data from Nielsen Nezavisimaya Gazeta.  Electronic commerce in China over the past 10 years has maintained high growth rates. <br><br>  Russian e-commerce is also developing at relatively high rates.  According to the analytical agency Data Insight, online trade in material goods amounted to 560 billion rubles in 2014.  At the same time, another 85 billion rubles last year accounted for the cross-border e-commerce segment.  Thus, the expenses of Russians on the purchase of material goods in online stores in 2014 amounted to 645 billion rubles (or about $ 10 billion).

      The growth of online sales of goods in Russian online stores in 2014 amounted to 35%.  Taking into account the purchases made by Russians in foreign online stores, this figure grew by more than 40% over the year. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  ‚ÄúThe e-commerce market in Russia is growing annually by 20‚Äì25%.  At the end of 2014, it amounted to $ 10 billion, and this year it may already be $ 13 billion, ‚Äùnoted the Head of the Federal Customs Service (FCS) Andrei Belyaninov. <br><br>  Meanwhile, Chinese online retailers do not plan to stop expansion in Russia.  At the end of October, a competitor to <a href="http://ru.aliexpress.com/ru_home.htm">AliExpress</a> , a large Chinese online retailer <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/JD.com">JD.com</a> , announced that it expects to occupy 60% of the Russian e-commerce market in the future. <br><br>  But, with the small size of the Russian Internet retailer market, it is difficult for Chinese companies to integrate into the Russian infrastructure, look for partners or create their own logistics networks with fast delivery here.  Therefore, Russian online and offline retailers still have a number of competitive advantages over Chinese and are looking for new opportunities for development. <br><br>  On October 23, a coupon campaign was launched on the Russian-language website JD.com, within which a new user of the site could receive a $ 10 coupon upon registration.  Shortly thereafter, the action was interrupted.  A few hours later, a user of the IT resource <a href="http://geektimes.ru/">geektimes.ru,</a> Yuriy Yuryev, <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/264564/">reported</a> a security <a href="http://geektimes.ru/">bug</a> in JD.com: ‚ÄúThere was a hole in the JD.com system.  By clicking on a simple and obvious link, anyone could see a list of other people's orders.  If you go into any order, you can see customer data: names, addresses, phone numbers and more. " <br><br>  As a result, 3,000 to 5,000 people were publicly available.  Later the problem was solved.  As representatives of JD.com reported in Russia, the hacker attack <a href="http://new-retail.ru/novosti/retail/russkoyazychnyy_sayt_jd_com_atakovali_khakery9495/">was to</a> blame. <br><br>  It intends to expand its presence in the Russian Federation and the Chinese company <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alibaba_Group">Alibaba</a> (which includes AliExpress).  This, in particular, was previously announced by First Deputy Prime Minister Igor Shuvalov.  Online store AliExpress announced its intention to sell cars in Russia.  On November 11, 2015, the marketplace will take the first step in this direction - it will begin selling discount coupons for cars of the Chinese brand Lifan.  The relevant agreement was <a href="http://rusbase.com/news/alicars/">signed</a> today in Moscow by Lifan Motors CEO Sun Zejun and the head of AliExpress in Russia, Mark Zavadsky. <br><br>  ‚ÄúLifan is already selling cars online in China - and more than successfully.  Online shopping in Russia is also very popular, including directly from the Middle Kingdom, ‚Äùsaid Zhejun at the event, telling about the reasons for the new partnership.  He also mentioned that online sales of Lifan in China amounted to 1,000 cars in 2015. <br><br>  Commercial Director of <a href="http://www.jde.ru/">ZhelDorEkspeditsiya</a> Evgeny Mozhaev believes that Russia, despite the economic crisis, remains a promising sales market, but the Chinese are losing their competitive price advantage due to long-term delivery.  As a result, Mozhaev believes, Russian online stores will get a powerful competitor and will be forced to cut prices and unite with each other. <br><br>  Retailers know that their consumers pay attention to prices, and tend to reduce them, bringing them to similar ones in online stores.  ‚ÄúAs a result, if the difference in the price list for one or another product is insignificant between a regular store and an online store, the consumer will rather overpay, but take the goods in the store of the brand known to him,‚Äù says the <a href="http://www.acort.ru/">ACORT</a> representative. <br><br>  The Internet is creating a hybrid trading model that uses online and offline technology.  This hybrid model is especially effective for promoting virtual goods and services - for example, ordering food or places in restaurants, as well as selling beauty salon services, says Victor Xu. <br><br>  On the other hand, Russian business would also be interested in the potential opportunity to enter the Chinese market, says Mozhaev.  ‚ÄúThis could be one of the business incentives for us,‚Äù the expert believes.  True, so far, apart from food and jewelry, we have nothing to offer.  The devaluation of the ruble serves as an incentive for entering new markets, but Chinese consumers are already spoiled by low prices, and taking their place in this niche will be extremely difficult, he said. <br><br>  The head of Alibaba, Jack Ma, proposed several projects to create logistics centers in the country.  It is assumed that in this way the Chinese can buy Russian goods via the Internet, which will then be stored in special centers and then delivered to Chinese consumers. <br><br>  The agreement to work for export from Russia has already been expressed by the trading platforms of Alibaba and JD.com.  Chinese consumers are interested in such product categories as chocolate and sweets, nuts, vegetable oil, honey, mushrooms and berries products, cereals, baby food. <br><br>  The site <a href="http://about.tmall.com/tmallglobal">Tmall Global</a> , owned by Alibaba Group, has been <a href="http://oborot.ru/news/15483/23">looking</a> for online stores in Russia since February to supply food and cosmetics to China.  In particular, negotiations were held with the producer of mineral water ‚ÄúNarzan‚Äù and the distributor of food products ‚ÄúMistral‚Äù. <br><br>  The Russian representative office of AliExpress believes that the Chinese consumer may also be interested in Russian cosmetics, pasteurized milk, condensed milk, nuts, jam, gingerbread, drying and other foods with a shelf life of three months.  After six months in the Middle Kingdom, they plan to open warehouses that will allow exporting Russian sausage. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/295974/">https://habr.com/ru/post/295974/</a></p>
