  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Google bought a doubleclick</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  According to <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/internetNews/idUSN1161140920080312%3FfeedType%3DRSS%26feedName%3DinternetNews%26sp%3Dtrue">Reuters</a> , Google bought one of the oldest online advertising companies, DoubleClick.  This deal was announced on April 14, 2007, but only now the antitrust services gave it a go-ahead, and Google instantly completed it. <br>  In press releases and news about this, they write with quite general ‚Äúadvertising‚Äù words - ‚ÄúThis deal will allow Google to accelerate its promotion of corporate banner advertising to the market and complete its development plan for this year,‚Äù ... but let's look a little deeper at the specifics of the deal and try to evaluate what will happen <a name="habracut"></a>  farther. <br><br>  First, the future integration of DoubleClick with all of us known AdSense / AdWords is quite obvious.  And if AdSense now has a somewhat ‚Äúmarginal‚Äù flavor, then DoubleClick, on the contrary, is strict, serious and elegant, like a concert Becker grand piano, because it is used for advertising campaigns of huge companies (from Visa to Microsoft).  By the way, it was precisely because of such a difference in positioning that the US and European antitrust services gave permission to Google for this purchase (if Google bought the company in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãactivity that it already deals with, this would obviously reduce competition in this area; but in this case, Google is just expanding its field of activity). <br>  But to us, as usual AdSense ‚Äúusers‚Äù, this will also certainly be noticeable. <br>  The effect for advertisers will be pleasant and convenient, whether advertisers of the ‚Äúformer DoubleClick‚Äù or ‚Äúformer AdWords‚Äù - they will be able to significantly expand the scope of coverage with their advertising campaigns at the expense of sites connected to the ‚Äúopposite‚Äù network.  There will, of course, be a few unpleasant surprises (in particular, due to the fact that Google‚Äôs competitors are now actively advertised on DoubleClick - for example, AOL and, of course, Microsoft), but on the whole the effect will be positive. <br>  The owners of advertising sites will have more options to choose between the form of a banner (text or graphic), depending on the convenience of fitting into the design of the site;  It‚Äôs possible that revenue will increase (more advertisements will allow for more targeted targeting and higher CTR - this will be useful to advertisers). <br>  Those who are just ‚Äúlooking at advertising‚Äù may pay attention to increasing its diversity and the emergence of completely new advertising campaigns on familiar websites. <br>  In addition, combining sufficiently different DoubleClick and Google targeting mechanisms will further increase the relevance of each of them, which again will have positive consequences for all three parties (such as improving advertiser attendance, increasing webmasters' revenues and increasing the benefits of advertising for " readers ‚Äù).  But this is already ... <br><br>  ‚Ä¶ Secondly.  Secondly, the approaches to advertising from Google and DoubleClick are quite different, and they have something to learn from each other.  Google has context-sensitive advertisements for keywords in a developed network of sites, but the main thing is that this ad is shown by requests in its super popular search engine.  What could be more perfect and more helpful than google ‚ÄúBMW X5‚Äù and immediately see the advertising link ‚ÄúBuy a BMW X5 from a warehouse in Moscow?‚Äù <br>  DoubleClick is much more interesting.  The old-fashioned positioning on banner advertising (which I‚Äôm not cutting now, I think, is only very lazy, which the eye learns to ignore very quickly), DoubleClick was forced to lick its banner system (DART) to shine to provide at least some effect from her <br>  Unlike Google, DoubleClick targets advertising not so much on the site as on the user.  Using cookies, it collects information about user‚Äôs transitions within and between sites, the number of times the same banner shows to the same user (and therefore, in particular, doesn‚Äôt show the same banner more than three times, even on different sites, because that he understands that if a user has not clicked on him for three views - he will never click on it), information about the user himself (operating system, location, provider - and taking into account the user's transition between sites, for sure - and his area of ‚Äã‚Äãinterest  mi).  Moreover, DoubleClick allows you to target ads on the collected information about the user - right up to the local time of day! <br>  Combining such mechanisms, targeting the content of the site and the user at the same time, will create a product with absolutely unique advertising targeting ... and it‚Äôs hard to imagine where the online advertising market can develop.

      <br>
      There is one more problem, but it‚Äôs too early to talk about its seriousness - or ‚Äúalready‚Äù.  At DoubleClick, at one time there was an epidemic of ‚Äúmalicious Flash banners‚Äù downloading files, redirecting the user to another page, etc.  If earlier, by placing the AdSense code on the site, the webmaster could be sure that from this only a few new lines of text would appear on his page, and at the same time a small script from Google would be executed (and Google). we trust the degrees);  if in a small ‚ÄúFlash-banner‚Äù network to which the webmaster was connected, such ‚Äúviruses‚Äù could hardly appear only because nobody needs this network;  then in the case of the global ‚ÄúAdSense + DoubleClick‚Äù new ad network, such a ‚Äúadvertising and viral campaign‚Äù will affect a large and extremely diverse set of sites. <br>  But this is, rather, the problem of "advertising in script formats" in general, than Google and DoubleClick. <br><br>  What do you think about this? <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/21612/">https://habr.com/ru/post/21612/</a></p>
