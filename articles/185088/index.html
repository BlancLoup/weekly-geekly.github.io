      So, what can be welded from such an ‚Äúax‚Äù? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Analyze the wishes of the parties: </h4><br>  <b>What does the manufacturer want?</b> <br>  Get for the work grandmother.  And more, more! <br>  At a minimum - to pay back the product, as a bonus - to receive money for a new one, as a super-bonus - to live normally for profit. <br><br>  <b>What does the viewer want?</b> <br>  Get for your grandmothers all and more! <br><br>  <b>What does torrent give?</b> <br>  The ability of the content distributor not to distribute to everyone, but to use the power of a distributed information storage network. <br><br>  <b>What does the fan community give?</b> <br>  The ability to complement and sponsor favorite works. <br><br>  <b>What are good Stems, GooglePlay, etc.?</b> <br>  The opportunity to easily get the desired content. <br><br><h4>  Already something looms, no? </h4><br>  <b>So i'm the author</b> <br>  With difficulty I got the money, I made a film in English and I want money for him. <br>  By default - grandmas I can get ONLY from an English-speaking audience - Russian, French, etc.  - mostly in flight, alas. <br><br>  In the current situation there are two options: <br>  Or I negotiate with offices in Russia, France, etc.  and they get their percents for translating and distributing.  But then the grandmother said much in two, take it, and what and how it goes. <br>  Or I score a bolt, as often happens with the same anime, and as a result, the fans themselves plan their own subs and, if desired, the voice acting.  The stump is clear, here you can only be indignant, complain and sue.  At the same time, no one gets any goodies. <br><br>  <b>Or i'm a viewer</b> <br>  There was a certain film in the United States on the screens.  Cool, but I'm in Russia!  No, sometimes adequate people come across and the film comes out immediately and everywhere, but, alas, not always. <br>  To go to the USA to see there?  The price of airline tickets is completely inadequate compared to movie tickets. <br>  Wait for the DVD?  So half a year at least wait! <br>  Download from tracker?  So we look at the beginning - piracy, alas, is sinful! <br><br>  <b>Or I ‚Äúrogue‚Äù, then with a fat and fat channel in the Internet</b> <br>  Alas, but to look - only trackers ... <br><br>  <b>Or I am a creative person who knows a bunch of languages, speaks different voices, etc.</b> <br>  Yes, I can take a film, translate, make captions, voice, etc.  etc.  But there is no profit from this, but since  Now it‚Äôs possible to distribute only through torrents - I‚Äôm becoming a pirate.  With such a creative pirate, and because ... that the right holder with those who downloaded my version of the translation would not have received any profit, because  nafig scored on this part of the audience ... <br><br><h4>  Is there a solution?  Yes, but in some places! </h4><br>  We will try to unite the nonunification in the opinion of the right holders ??? <br><br>  <b>So, I am an author.</b> <br>  I made a film, after which I spread it on a certain national resource.  As a video track + audio + subs + additional materials. <br>  And I set prices in accordance with the costs that I want for the video - so much for the audio - so much, for the subs - so much.  If a single viewing is the sum of 1, if it wants to the collection - 2, if for display in the cinema - 3. <br><br>  <b>I'm a viewer</b> <br>  ‚ÄúOh, cool, a new action movie has been released!‚Äù - I pay a coin and I shake.  The part of the sum that makes up the cost of channel payment goes to those who have already downloaded and distributes.  Right? <br>  I downloaded, looked and stayed in the distribution - you are dripping a penny for maintaining the infrastructure. <br><br>  <b>I'm rogue</b> <br>  Honestly bought one movie, after which the year zadrodstvoval on hand and saved up for two more.  Distributed them - appeared on something else, etc. <br><br>  <b>I am a creative person</b> <br>  I downloaded, looked at Anglitsky, sat down, dashed off subs and laid out as an addition to the film.  The viewer can choose my version of the credits instead of the English ones and it will be them that will download.  And I have a little money for this dripping from every view with my sabies!  It is clear that the author of video and audio receives money at its ‚Äúrate‚Äù! <br><br>  But another creative person re-sounded on the basis of my sabs.  To me, the use of subs by percents, the personality - for voice acting, to the author of the original - for the video and, in part, for the original audio track (here the price question is, is there a ‚Äúclean‚Äù track in the set, without votes?). <br><br>  Here is the third very strongly creative person re-sounded "from scratch", inventing his funny translation and not using anything from the original at all, except for the video ... <br><br>  As a result, the viewer shakes what is interesting to him and in the ‚Äúbundle‚Äù he is interested in! <br>  Well, it turns someone away from the voice of the great and mighty, but I want to postebatsya on how it sounds on the move, but the plot is interesting and chose the Russian subs ... <br>  Or someone can hardly disassemble the subs and selects the voice acting ... And so on. <br>  Everyone is happy - and the author, and the audience and creative people. <br><br>  Unhappy only very, very beggarly and advertisers. <br>  But please!  Choose the item ‚Äúwith advertising‚Äù and ‚Äúenjoy‚Äù with the fact that the uncle advertiser will pay part of the money for viewing, but you will eat up trailers, advertisements for kala and female diapers! <br><br>  It is clear that the studios can put up their own version of voice acting with their price.  And here the viewer already ‚Äúvotes in a ruble‚Äù, which is more pleasant for him - Krucenko‚Äôs voice instead of Schwarzenegger, or Vasi Pupkin, who is behind the scenes! <br><br>  What if I paid, downloaded, started watching and realized that this is another Migalki in the company with the worst movie? <br>  Stop, put "dizlaik" and the money returned to the account, in proportion to how many had time to see.  Then it's up to you - you no longer have access to watch, but you can get yours back by gurgling at the distribution.  Or erase from disk to edren fen, so as not to participate in the dissemination of this VNA! <br><br>  Converters to Low and different formats?  Yes, calm! <br><br>  Charges, by analogy with the kickstarter, ranging from "On film" and ending with "On voice acting"?  Trite! <br><br><h4>  Summary </h4><br>  I repeat: individually, all this is and implemented!  But‚Ä¶ <br>  Who has the opportunity to realize and push through - I give the idea. <br>  But at once I say that it‚Äôs better to take on a thread of an international office, such as Google, without being hung up on a single platform! <br><br>  PS And if someone can still do it, maybe it won't offend you with a penny?  In an extreme case, the possibilities of NORMALLY AND LEGALLY RECEIVING ACCESS TO FILMS IN THE NATIVE LANGUAGE AND TIME are enough for me! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/185088/">https://habr.com/ru/post/185088/</a></p>
