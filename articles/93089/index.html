  <section class="page js-page"><h1>European service Seagate. Positive continues</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img alt="Seagate wheels" src="http://www.kolyan.cz/images/seagatedisks.jpg"><br>  About a month ago, I ordered my external disk from Seagate to live.  He behaved himself strangely for a long time and finally passed away.  The treatment with standard utilities from the manufacturer did not give any result, I decided to return under warranty. <br>  Having opened <nobr>the invoice,</nobr> I was unpleasantly surprised that the two-year warranty of the store ended a month before the incident.  I went to the manufacturer's website and after entering the serial number and batch number I saw the inscription ‚ÄúIn Warranty‚Äù in green.  I made an application, chose a point for receiving broken screws in Munich and sent it that very evening. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Seagate writes on their pages that they do not recover information, but simply send a new disk. <br>  A week later, a notice arrives in the mail about the parcel.  I am at a loss because there is no mark on the site that they received my disk.  I go to the post office and get my old disk with the crossed address of the addressee.  When I asked: ‚ÄúWhy do I get my package back?‚Äù The girl in the mail only shrugged her shoulders. <br>  Reaching home, I called the Seagate Call Center, where I was answered by a girl with an Indian accent.  He said that it was necessary to send them to the office in Amsterdam, not to the Munich collection point.  She was unable to answer my question, for which reason I was then given the choice of a reception point on the site. <br>  I perekleil address and sent the disk again, already in Amsterdam.  All the same usual cheapest package for 12 euros.  A week later, it came to me that they received a disk and three days later they wrote that they had sent me a new disk through DHL. <br>  And now, after 10 days of waiting, a girl from Seagate calls me, without an accent.  He says that they were told from DHL that they could not find me and asked what to do with the package.  It turns out that Seagate does not indicate when sending a phone number and therefore cannot find me.  After finding the girl‚Äôs tracking number, which Seagate doesn‚Äôt indicate in the letter about the delivery of the CD, I called the Czech office of DHL.  And I agreed that I would take it myself from a warehouse in √≠ƒçany (20 km from Prague). <br>  I arrived, found an office, signed papers and took everything in 20 minutes. An ordinary brown box, unusually dirty, probably because it could not find me for a long time.  It has the same brown box, but already clean.  And in her drive.  And here is a surprise.  Instead of my old Seagate FreeAgent Desktop, I got a brand new FreeAgent Desk of the same size. <br>  Having reached the house the disc was successfully divided into two parts.  One NTFS, the second WBFS, for downloading Wii games.  The new disc, by the way, looks great next to the Wii.  Everything works, everything is ok. <br>  In general, <nobr>something</nobr> at Seagate is not good with logistics, but the service is excellent. </div>
