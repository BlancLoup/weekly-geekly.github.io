For me, these ideas work "one hundred percent." <br>  New ideas often come to me.  As a rule, I have been carrying a new idea inside for some time.  Then I start to get around with the discussion of this idea (for example, in LiveJournal, this blog or in real life).  Discussion allows you to weed out too much, sometimes just to build thoughts, sometimes give birth to new ones. <br>  Very often (in most cases) I hear variations of the same answer - <strong>‚ÄúYou will not succeed!‚Äù</strong> <br>  <strong>Why the hell?</strong>  I communicate with intelligent people.  I consider many smarter than myself.  But the answer is in most cases one. <br><br>  I recently thought about this problem.  This is a problem, because it is much easier for me to develop existing ideas and invent new ones, not when I reflect negative attacks, but on the contrary - I feel the support of the interlocutor. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Conclusion - disappointing.  <strong>Many (perhaps all) people live in a fantasy world.</strong>  Each such world contains a certain framework for which it is impossible to escape within this world. <br>  <strong>Part of these boundaries in the brain begins with the "no".</strong>  You can not start a business from scratch and earn a million dollars a year.  You can not teach others without a good education.  You cannot produce a successful concert without knowing anything about the arrangement of the concerts. <br>  <strong>The second part of the borders begins with "to".</strong>  To make good money - you need to work hard.  To open your business - you need to know a lot and be able to.  To lead - you need a long time to work in low positions and gain experience. <br>  <strong>Do you know what I tell you?</strong>  <strong><em>All these statements - complete unconditional garbage!</em></strong>

    <blockquote>  These thoughts do not contradict thoughts about the fact that you have to work very hard.  You can earn a million over the weekend from scratch.  You can even hold it and multiply.  But, colleagues, we live in a world where probability rules.  Think, what are the chances for no reason to earn a huge pile of money for the next week-end?  Chances are small.  But in our hands the opportunity to <strong>increase</strong> them <strong>many times</strong> - to launch more projects, to look for new opportunities, new people.  <strong>This work is sufficient and necessary.</strong>  <strong>And it will be very much.</strong> </blockquote><br><br>  At first, I wanted to mark this article with links in order to give an opportunity to see how people sweep away all the boundaries that I have listed.  References to real people and real examples. <br>  Perhaps this would help expand your inner frame.  If not completely remove the walls, then at least expand the corridor. <br>  I did not put links.  I decided that if someone is on the right path, then he will easily recall examples from his experience that do not correspond either ‚Äúcan not‚Äù or ‚Äúto‚Äù. <br>  Why all this?  Yes, simply because <strong>I want to live not in spite of, but thanks to</strong> .  And the more people will share my opinion and push the boundaries of their internal corridors to infinity - the more comfortable I will live. <br>  The only thing I regret is that <strong>I realized all this too late</strong> . <br>  Most of his life listened to the opinion of mediocrity.  But I corrected myself.  I'm going forward.  As fast as I can.  And I do not stop to look at those whom I have overtaken.  I'm not on the road with them.  I do not consider them as competitors.  And I don't care what happens to them. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/29221/">https://habr.com/ru/post/29221/</a></p>
