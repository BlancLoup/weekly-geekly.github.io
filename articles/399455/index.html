    <h2>  How does professional acoustics differ from home high-end? </h2><br>  In some markets, ‚Äúprofessional‚Äù is a synonym for a more expensive and status object.  However, in the case of loudspeakers and related equipment, the main difference between the professional and "user" segments really lies in the plane of the product's purpose: Hi-Fi is used at home for comfortable listening - that is, for pleasure, for relaxation. <br><br>  Professional sound equipment is designed to work in the relevant field (concert halls, clubs, restaurants with banquets, sound studios, etc.).  In this case, the prefix "pro" is <i>not a synonym for elitism, but an indicator of the purpose of the product</i> . <br><br>  The frequent difference between the professional segment and Hi-Fi is the sound power.  Professional equipment must withstand large and prolonged loads (10‚Äì15 hours of uninterrupted work), produce a ‚Äúsmooth‚Äù sound without distortion at high volume (in this format no one listens to music at home).  It uses large speakers, powerful components, and the appearance of the system often fades into the background. <br><br>  In the home equipment plays a huge role nuances, features of sound, as well as the quality of finishes.  Manufacturers to the smallest details think through every little thing.  Components are selected with great care, the design of acoustics or electronics has an important role. <br><br>  Since it is important for Hi-Fi equipment that the sound is balanced and detailed even at low volume, the engineers who design such acoustics or amplifier have completely different tasks.  In the amplifier there should be low noise capacitors and transformers, the case itself should also be not only reliable and have ventilation slots for cooling, but also a pleasant eye. <br><br>  The speakers in such equipment are usually smaller than those used for pro-acoustics (the dimensions of the speakers and the components in this case reduce not to the detriment of the sound), this allows you to make the whole system more compact. <br><br><h2>  Can I use Hi-Fi acoustics instead of professional? </h2><br>  Once we were faced with a situation where the customer was planning a serious restaurant and wanted the background music playing for visitors to be as comfortable and pleasant to the ear as possible, and the appearance of the acoustics had to match the interior (in the color of the wenge tree).  Since the restaurant was small, this idea was realized: instead of an amplifier, a powerful receiver was used in a special mode and 3 pairs of bookshelf speakers with wall brackets. <br><br>  However, Hi-Fi equipment is not exactly what is needed for background sound in the same restaurant.  It is designed for small rooms (rooms from 15 to 40 meters on average).  The areas of restaurants and cafes often have more than 50 meters, and home equipment (without serious interference with the acoustics and design of the room) is simply not designed for such spaces. <br><br>  The main misconception in this case stems from the fact that professional acoustics, designed specifically for the background sound of rooms, is inexpensive - compared to Hi-Fi kits.  For buyers, the principle ‚Äúcheap means suspicious and bad‚Äù often works. <br><br>  Professional systems in this case may not sound as interesting, detailed and bright as Hi-Fi, but they will also work in a large and rather noisy room - and they will work for a long time.  In such conditions, in an unprepared room this is quite enough. <br><br><h2>  Who may need prof.  equipment - except professional musicians or sound producers? </h2><br>  Someone (we already voiced this case) takes professional acoustics for a cafe, someone - to kindergarten, to school, someone - for outdoor events, etc.  Usually for such purposes, active sets of acoustics are popular (2 satellite + built-in mixer).  In connection with the widespread opening of karaoke clubs in Russia, radio microphones and mixing consoles with built-in effects are in great demand. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RzJLbhKkNpQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  If we talk about <a href="http://www.audiomania.ru/muzykalnye_intrumenty/">musical instruments</a> (in Audiomania, you can buy them too recently) now quite a lot of non-professionals are interested in digital pianos (for example, for children who study at a music school, or simply ‚Äúfor the soul‚Äù).  They <a href="http://www.audiomania.ru/sintezator/">have</a> a number of advantages compared to the classical instrument: they do not take up much space, they can be moved and transported in a passenger car, you do not need to order a tuner every year and you can play in headphones without disturbing anyone. <br><br>  A separate niche is occupied by the equipment for podcast recordings - many people now buy <a href="http://www.audiomania.ru/usb_microfon/">studio microphones</a> and sound cards for home recordings.  By the way, microphones for iOS, portable recorders, as well as various accessories (racks, covers, cables, brackets - without which practically not a single project related to sound recording - both professional and amateur) still comes along - this is absolutely New products for Audiomania. <br><br>  We have plans to expand the <a href="http://www.audiomania.ru/mikrofon_dlja_konferencij/">equipment</a> segment <a href="http://www.audiomania.ru/mikrofon_dlja_konferencij/">for conferences</a> (there are whole systems, serious sets for large audiences): this is another interesting area in which prof.  equipment may be interesting to those who are far from professional sound recording.  The broadcast equipment was presented here before - mainly by the Apart brand.  Now added products from other manufacturers of professional equipment: QSC, JBL, Penton, Tannoy. <br><br><h2>  Now about the musicians: what is interesting, unique or rare for Audiomania for this audience? </h2><br>  For three years now, <a href="http://www.audiomania.ru/shop/taurus.html">Taurus</a> has been present in our product range - in Russia only we present products from this Polish manufacturer.  Bass and guitar amps, cabinets, combo amps and effects pedals.  Endorsing brand in Russia are musicians from the group "Aria" - Vitaly Dubinin and Sergey Popov. <br><br>  Sophisticated musicians should pay attention to the <a href="http://www.audiomania.ru/shop/analysis-plus.html">Analysis Plus microphone and guitar cables</a> (this is our exclusive distribution).  Another interesting option for professional cables is the German brand Schulz, which musicians value for good quality at a relatively low cost. <br><br>  Also, special attention should be paid to the already legendary German studio monitors <a href="http://www.audiomania.ru/studijnyj_monitor/adam/adam_a5x.html">ADAM</a> , which also appeared in our range recently, and <a href="http://www.audiomania.ru/shop/qsc.html">QSC</a> products (these are acoustics, amplifiers with embedded processors and digital mixing consoles, which attract much attention due to their functionality and ease of management) . <br><br>  It is no secret that there are brands that make equipment both in the home equipment segment and in the pro-direction, for example, DENON and Marantz: they are now also expanding their range.  Marantz has good studio microphones, new portable and stationary recorders, studio monitors have appeared;  DENON should pay attention to professional players and <a href="http://www.audiomania.ru/professionalnyj_rekorder/denon/">recorders</a> , as well as studio monitors. <br><br><h2>  What do you recommend to give a musician for the New Year? </h2><br>  It is very difficult to please the musician if he did not voice his wishes himself - there are quite a few directions among the same guitarists.  Something universal does not exist, even processors and effects pedals are selected according to the style of music.  But in any case, there are accessories that will always come in handy for the guitarist - this is a new <a href="http://www.audiomania.ru/guitar_cases/">guitar case</a> , belt or <a href="http://www.audiomania.ru/pedalboard/">pedalboard</a> under the effects pedals.  A useful and budget gift for a drummer is a set of new <a href="http://www.audiomania.ru/electronic_drum_set/">drum sticks</a> , as they often break. <br><br>  A more significant and expensive gift to the guitarist is a quality <a href="http://www.audiomania.ru/guitar_cable/">guitar cable</a> .  For a drummer who plays only at rehearsal bases, an electronic drum set can be a suitable gift.  And for a person playing the digital piano or synthesizer, a gift in the form of good overheads or <a href="http://www.audiomania.ru/tag/studiynie_naushniki/">covering headphones</a> that will allow him to enjoy his game or study without losing all the advantages of the built-in speakers of the instrument may come up. <br><br>  PS Additional reading on the topic: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/audiomania/blog/282486/">How to build a home theater, and what you can learn about the production of acoustics</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-4815.html">What you need to know about modern audio systems</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-4818.html">How to make audio element of the interior</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/399455/">https://habr.com/ru/post/399455/</a></p>
