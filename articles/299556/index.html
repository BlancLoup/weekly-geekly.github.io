A little about the history of Audiommania</a> </h5><br><ul><li>  The history of Audiomania began in 1997, when several businessmen organized a retail outlet on ‚ÄúGorbushka‚Äù; </li><li>  Then, at the Riga Radio Market, the first store of the company appeared, which then had no name; </li><li>  Gradually, the main direction of the company shifted towards high-quality audio equipment; </li><li>  ‚ÄúBut you work for audiomaniacs?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWell, it‚Äôs not for me to name the company with Audiomania‚Äù; </li><li>  By 2003, the company already had an office, a warehouse, and a second store in Prague. </li></ul><br><ul><li>  The company has established its own deliveries from abroad, which could not fail to attract the attention of other Russian retailers; </li><li>  In 2007, there was a merger of the distribution division of Audiomania with Marvel Distribution; </li><li>  In addition to offline sales, it became possible to talk about the development of multi-channel retail; </li><li>  At about the same time, the do-it- <a href="http://www.audiomania.ru/shop/cat-10.html">yourself</a> direction of electronic components was launched; </li><li>  By 2008, the offline business went online. </li></ul><br><ul><li>  Initially, the online store was focused mainly on Moscow and the Moscow region; </li><li>  The ability to pay for goods with electronic money gave a qualitative leap in the growth of the audience from the regions; </li><li>  The company has made a bid to communicate with customers, who engaged people with years of experience in the field of audio; </li><li>  We did not focus on a certain communication channel - if it is inconvenient to call, communication is transferred to chat or email; </li><li>  It was decided to divide the consultants not by sales channels, but by areas of knowledge. </li></ul><br><ul><li>  The company decided that the buyer should be entitled to listen to the equipment ‚Äúin action‚Äù, even if he had not paid for it yet; </li><li>  Next, we introduced a trade-in, when buyers were able to pass the acoustics and, by paying the difference, purchase a new one; </li><li>  We have developed a ‚Äúdelivery calculator‚Äù - even on the product card, you can find out the cost of delivery to the regions. </li></ul><br><h6>  Findings: </h6><br><ul><li>  The more alternatives for your customer are, the better; </li><li>  The same applies to the format of communication with the consultant; </li><li>  Consultants should be genuinely interested in what you are selling; </li><li>  Communication with a specialist should not require immediate purchase; </li><li>  At the place of the client, you can learn a lot about how to make his life better. </li></ul><br><h5>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/audiomania/blog/241061/">2. eCommerce technologies in the service of B2B projects</a> </h5><br><ul><li>  It becomes obvious that all business transactions will occur using IT; </li><li>  The problem is that many use technology in order to use technology; </li><li>  There are not so many modern high-tech solutions that can really give effect immediately; </li><li>  Distributors need the capabilities that modern IT tools will provide in the hands of their dealers; </li><li>  Unfortunately, eCommerce products for the most part are made by people far from eCommerce. </li></ul><br><h5>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/audiomania/blog/243841/">3. Automation of financial accounting online store</a> </h5><br><ul><li>  Standard systems used to automate accounting do not have the required flexibility; </li><li>  To create our own financial accounting system, we studied international reporting systems; </li><li>  The main task was the need to build a variety of reports on income and expenses; </li><li>  A template was created to automatically enter information into the system; </li><li>  "Own" system gives a clearer picture of the costs of each of the departments of the company. </li></ul><br><ul><li>  All processes that the employee performed in the pre-computer era should be the same when working with software; </li><li>  We rarely fundamentally change business processes, rather we try to adapt the system for people; </li><li>  Of course, all accounting is conducted in accordance with the law. </li></ul><br><h5>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/audiomania/blog/244284/">4. eCommerce for newbies</a> </h5><br><ul><li>  The first thing you need to do is define your e-commerce goals; </li><li>  The best option for you at the very beginning will be the choice of a particular specialization, or niche; </li><li>  You will need to find reliable suppliers to trade quality goods; </li><li>  To present yourself on the Internet you will need a specialized website for selling goods; </li><li>  Your logo and brand design are also important factors. </li></ul><br><ul><li>  When your company becomes more famous, you will not interfere with the unique selling proposition (USP); </li><li>  Many firms choose a price as their UTP, and, in most cases, this affects them negatively; </li><li>  The most accessible key indicator that will be the easiest to track is the conversion rate; </li><li>  Another indicator that deserves attention is the cost of attracting a client (SEC or CAC); </li><li>  Customer value during its life cycle (LTV, Lifetime Value) is considered the most important indicator. </li></ul><br><h5>  <a href="https://megamozg.ru/company/audiomania/blog/17352/">5. Unobvious ways to increase conversion: cases of "Audiomania" and "Boffo"</a> </h5><br><ul><li>  An important stage is work on increasing the number of calls from the regions to the number 8-800; </li><li>  The experiment - free delivery throughout the country with the exception of hard-to-reach regions; </li><li>  It is sometimes easier for customers from small towns to come to the regional center and pick up goods from there; </li><li>  If you have a well-established work of the courier service, give customers the opportunity to choose the exact time of delivery; </li><li>  If there are too many data on a product, organize them by tabs and indicate the conditions of return in the product card. </li></ul><br>  <i>PS Other audio materials, reviews and useful tips are in our blog ‚Äú <a href="http://www.audiomania.ru/mirhifi/">Hi-Fi World</a> ‚Äù.</i> </div>
