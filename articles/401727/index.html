A dirty souvenir, a set with shaving foam, socks - and in the appendage is a postcard with stamped banality?  We are familiar with this pain in Madrobots, therefore we present to your attention a mini-guide for good geeky gifts.  It includes various gadgets (and other interesting things) for every taste and wallet. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Smart car charger Nonda ZUS Car Charger </h3><br>  <i>To: technically advanced motorist</i> <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wLY8G3P6l5g" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  California startup Nonda has turned a banal car charger into a real smart device.  ZUS Car Charger is inserted into the standard cigarette lighter, as well as less "brainy" counterparts.  The case is quite large - 8.4 centimeters in length, made of dark gray plastic and has a stylish design that won the IF and RedDot awards in 2016.

      The gadget works with an input voltage of 12 and 24 volts, and delivers a current of 2.4 amps with a voltage of 5 volts to two USB connectors.  Nests are equipped with LED lighting and angled to each other so that the wires are not confused.  The ports are reversible, so that the plug is inserted by either side - very convenient. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7d1/868/e7a/7d1868e7a3d44c449c13684ff3dc6218.jpg"><br><br>  ZUS Car Charger connects to your smartphone via Bluetooth.  Brand mobile application is available for devices based on iOS version 8.0 and above and Android 4.3 (Jelly Bean).  After installing it, charging becomes a smart locator: when the engine turns off, it automatically remembers the position of the car.  The car becomes very easy to find in the open parking area on the compass in the application.  In addition, a parking timer and a monitor are available in the application for checking the voltage on the car battery. <br><br>  Additional attractive features of the charger include ‚Äúindestructibility‚Äù.  The developers tested the ZUS Car Charger at extreme temperatures, and the gadget failed only when heated to 140.  Charging is equipped with a cooling system and complies with the military standard MIL-STD-810G. <br><br>  Buy <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/nonda-zus-car-charger/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3D23_poborka">Nonda ZUS Car Charger</a> can be in the catalog Madrobots. <br><br><h3>  RoboShar Sphero 2.0 </h3><br>  <i>To: a little geek, the head of a large family, the owner of a dog</i> <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1S5lUDvlu3A" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Sphero 2.0 Robotic Ball is a great example of a device that encourages active interaction with other people through games. <br><br>  Sphero 2.0 is a ball with a diameter of 74 mm and a weight of 168 grams, made of white polycarbonate.  Inside are the ARM Cortex M4 processor, a Bluetooth module, an accelerometer, a gyroscope, a controller, LEDs, and other electronics.  The surface of the ball is waterproof, but it is not shockproof, so it is better not to drop it from a height of more than 15 centimeters.  The gadget independently rolls on any surface at a speed of 2 m / s and receives a signal at a distance of up to 30 meters. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/862/0ef/b02/8620efb0273c4ed79dca9bb46c995207.jpg"><br><br>  Sphero is managed via a mobile application for Windows Phone, iOS and Android.  Immediately available are two and a half dozen games, including multiplayer. <br><br>  It is quite difficult to pilot a robo ball, but with a well-trained owner skill, Sphero is capable of unusual tricks.  Robo shar races can be a favorite entertainment of a group of friends and a great reason to get out into nature.  In the latter case, for Sphero worth buying a protective rubber case. <br><br>  The battery lasts for an hour of work.  Charging is carried out in an inductive way on a special stand, and will take about three hours with fully discharged batteries. <br><br>  You can purchase Sphero 2.0 <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/robotizirovannyy-shar-orbotix-sphero-2-0/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3D23_poborka">from us</a> . <br><br><h3>  Anti-stress cube Fidget Cube </h3><br>  <i>To: restless buddy or colleague</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6bd/045/c79/6bd045c7971a4ef487552c4ec86dd1d6.jpg"><br><br>  Some people, because of their worries and habits, fidget constantly, fiddling with pens, keys, smartphones and everything that comes handy.  Vinyl cube Fidget Cube, which we have already described on the pages of Geektimes, is made specifically for them. <br><br>  The small vinyl cube fits comfortably in your hand and is comfortable to hold.  On its five sides are placed switches and buttons, and on the sixth - a recess under the thumb, like on a stone for meditation.  Some of the switches are silent, and the rest are quietly and pleasantly clicked. <br><br>  Fidget Cube promotes concentration and reduces stress just as well as a bubble film.  But, unlike the latter, the cube is reusable and does not deteriorate after active use. <br><br>  Buy <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/fidget-cube-3-bundle/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3D23_poborka">Fidget Cube</a> you can in our store. <br><br><h3>  Bobby City Backpack </h3><br>  <i>To: student, student, office worker</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9ef/027/38c/9ef02738cdfc4414912f30c6c5532655.jpg"><br><br>  XDesign‚Äôs stylish Bobby backpack has already hit our blog.  Recall that the development of Dutch designers has an unusual "anti-theft" design. <br><br>  The zipper of the main compartment runs along the edge of the backpack and is hidden in the fold of the fabric, so Bobby cannot be opened without being noticed by the owner.  Cutting a backpack is also not possible, because it is made of several layers of fabric and protective materials. <br><br>  The backpack weighs 850 grams, its dimensions are 45 to 30 by 16.5 cm. Inside the laptop fits with a diagonal of 15.6 ". Things are fixed in their places and do not hang out while walking, so Bobby reduces the load on the shoulders and back. <br><br>  You can purchase this necessary boom accessory <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/xddesign-bobby/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3D23_poborka">in our catalog</a> . <br><br><h3>  Zavtra Kit: Document Cover and Wallet </h3><br>  <i>To: no vegan, a man with taste</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1a9/78d/70d/1a978d70dabf491cb86adba4ad783d13.jpg"><br><br>  The Zavtra accessories brand is Madrobots pride because we designed it from scratch.  Special holiday kit includes a minimalist wallet and a cover for documents. <br><br>  Both items are sewn of high-quality Turkish leather.  We vouch for quality, as we have been using the first samples for more than a year now.  Bank cards, a few banknotes are placed inside the accessories (in 2017 it‚Äôs time to switch to non-cash payments!), And the cover also contains a passport with a driver's license. <br><br>  Zavtra's wallet is very thin and does not open its pockets, as it usually happens with leather wallets.  As a result, you can walk with him everywhere and leave him in jeans, without fear that he will fall out at the wrong moment.  Passport cover is no less ‚Äúslim‚Äù and elegant. <br><br>  You <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/zavtra-bundle/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3D23_poborka">can</a> buy Zavtra wallet <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/zavtra-bundle/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3D23_poborka">from Madrobots</a> . <br><br><h3>  3D puzzle Ugears "Safe" </h3><br>  <i>To: adult fan of designers</i> <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2aNt7PjH7WU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Ukrainian company Ugears has come a long way from a modest startup to the world-famous manufacturer of mechanical models in the style of steampunk.  Almost each of them has moving mechanical elements and is assembled without glue. <br><br>  A set of Ugears locomotive, apron and barrier may seem too expensive and a binding gift, and it is better to leave it until the New Year or birthday.  But a miniature safe - a great option for an intermediate holiday. <br><br>  The safe consists of 179 parts.  The assembly takes about six hours, and the result is a real, functional safe with a combination lock on three digits.  To hack the mechanism, you will need to either go through a thousand combinations, or listen to the clicks of the lock.  The safe is beautiful and looks great as an element of decor. <br><br>  This is a great gift, you <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/3d-pazl-ugears-seyf-safe/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3D23_poborka">can</a> buy a <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/3d-pazl-ugears-seyf-safe/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3D23_poborka">kit from us</a> . <br><br><h3>  Multitul-bracelet Leatherman Tread </h3><br>  <i>To: master of all trades</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/57b/5dd/365/57b5dd365b5142afac009c8d76d0b493.jpg"><br><br>  The American brand Leatherman is known for its tools and knives, and now has developed the Trend multi-bracelet.  The functional decoration came into being thanks to the protection of Disneyland: vigilant employees somehow confiscated a real multi-tool from President Leatherman. <br><br>  Trend consists of ten links and fasteners on which 29 tools are placed, from screwdrivers and wrenches to a carbide tip for breaking glass.  It turns out a bulky bracelet for a very large wrist, but it is easy to reduce the length by removing a couple of pieces. <br><br>  The bracelet is made of high quality stainless steel 17-4 and weighs 168 grams fully loaded.  It will not replace a suitcase with these tools, but it is always at hand, like a smartphone. <br><br>  You can purchase a much needed tool <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/leatherman-tread/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3D23_poborka">in the Madrobots catalog</a> . <br><br><h3>  Zowi BQ training robot </h3><br>  <i>To: geeks of middle and primary school age</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/020/75f/bb6/02075fbb6f02432cb17a79e90badfdd9.jpg"><br><br>  Spanish manufacturer of smartphones and tablets BQ in 2015 unexpectedly introduced the robot Zowi.  The toy is designed with the intention of teaching children programming and robotics. <br><br>  Zowi confidently walks on two massive legs, knows how to dance and jump.  The eyes of the robot are two ultrasonic sensors that help him avoid obstacles.  The battery will last for 8 hours of play. <br><br>  The robot connects via Bluetooth to mobile devices on Android.  In addition to settings and controls, the proprietary application includes games that open up new skills for the robot.  Zowi also supports Bitbloq block language programming. <br><br>  The robot is already in our store, where you <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/zowi-bq/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3D23_poborka">can buy it</a> . <br><br><h3>  Virtual reality helmet HTC Vive </h3><br>  <i>To: a friend or relative who has a powerful gaming PC</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f2c/f51/31a/f2cf5131acdf4d0797ee79e10275fb78.jpg"><br><br>  There is no sense in telling in detail about the virtual reality helmet HTC Vive.  The legendary device received more than convincing coverage on Geektimes and needs no introduction. <br><br>  The only point that I would like to highlight is the compatibility of the helmet.  As we learned from experience at Madrobots, the minimum system requirements do not guarantee that the Vive will work the first time or will work in principle. <br><br>  Therefore, you should first at least test your computer using the Steam VR Performance Test program.  It weighs 1.9 Gigabytes and is downloaded for free if you have an account and a Steam client.  The test itself will take a couple of minutes, and at the end it will give a detailed analysis of the state of the system and recommendations on which parts should be upgraded. <br><br>  In Russia, the helmet can be <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/htc-vive-pre/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3D23_poborka">purchased from the company Madrobots</a> . <br><br><h3>  Madrobots gift certificate for 10 000 rubles </h3><br>  <i>To: family member, close friend</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/79e/2df/637/79e2df6378074bcc832983d517b0b979.jpg"><br><br>  <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/sertifikat-10000/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3D23_poborka">Madrobots Gift Card</a> allows you to buy any item from our store catalog.  The certificate is valid for a whole year from the date of purchase, during which time the gifted one will have time to decide which gadget he needs, or even be able to successfully get one of our sales. <br><br>  We are sure that our selection will help you to please your loved ones with an original gift for February 23.
