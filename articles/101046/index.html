  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Review of the Chinese tablet on Android</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Not so long ago, I came across a Chinese tablet with Android OS.  The device has no identifying marks, it is a test copy, delivered by Chinese comrades.  I volunteered to test it and now I want to share with you my impressions about this tablet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/bb/43/bb43523728848fc5bd6a123c69b29deb.jpg" alt="tablet on Android"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The desire to copy the design of Apple products immediately catches the eye.  For this it was necessary even to sacrifice the convenience of control.  On the front surface of the tablet there is only one button, which is also not used for navigation, but serves to put the device into sleep mode or wake up.

Nothing at all. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/27/f4/27f4f683f524cfcfe8427bc49cfa0eef.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  A small surprise awaits us when the device is turned on.  In front of the expected android logo, a bird appears in the upper left corner of the screen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/76/84/76841a2abcf1b0fe203fe8c0776b3ca3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  After final loading the screen we see the following: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/bf/5c/bf5c62f9c0f52a4c3ba61f9ba7352712.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  With the words "outside the service area" to do nothing.  The tablet considers itself to be a telephone, but at the same time there is no space for a SIM card.  By the way, the location of the "Menu" button required to unlock the screen is also nontrivial.  It is located on the top edge and on the first (and even on the second, and the third) time it seems to be a volume ‚Äúrocker‚Äù.  Who thought up to combine in the "rocker" keys Menu and Home - a mystery. <br><br>  Here are the buttons and connectors in more detail.  From the signatures it should be clear what was happening: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/28/1e/281e6d8c1114d9d53e8b30f99d48d5da.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  For a charger, the plug reminds you of hi from the beginning of the past decade.  I could not get USB charging, despite the two mini-USB connectors present. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/91/52/915220e8bf859f335f3856ea25c905d4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The screen of the tablet is resistive, 7 inches, 800x480 resolution.  The screen ‚Äúgoes blind‚Äù in the sun, the room is seen quite well.  WiFi network picked up quickly.  Of course, the first thing I got on the "Habr".  Surfing the Internet is possible, although not very familiar.  With a trackball it would be much more convenient. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/15/29/1529e89a48daf92536f74b8c7fddb631.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  G-sensor is present, but it works with a very noticeable delay.  There is no GPS module, although maps in this format are much more convenient to watch than on smartphones. <br><br>  Several photos with technical details for those interested: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/ed/0a/ed0a98a733c87a0d848b1847991bd1da.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/e2/74/e274a1ab9ca93d6af18c7b48980eb06d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/b9/2f/b92f14cb634d2b0c4b1403f96bf027d6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I put a few applications from the Android Market, since it was on the tablet.  General feeling: the device slows down, lacks either the amount of memory or the frequency of the processor.  The video noticeably slows down.  Books can be read. <br><br>  But the very extravaganza I left for a snack is the front camera.  It is not clear why such a camera is needed at all.  I heard reviews that bad cameras can be installed in Chinese devices.  But the reality has surpassed all my ideas about how bad the built-in cameras can be.  During the processing of photographs for review, it was even necessary to replace the prepared epithet ‚Äúa little less than completely miserable‚Äù with ‚Äúa little more than completely miserable‚Äù.  And that's why.  Usually you shoot your face on the front camera, for review it was necessary to photograph something else.  And it turned out that the camera is not only different in its useless resolution, but also sees the world in mirror image: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/6b/3e/6b3e3944df2cebeeed168910c53d15a8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Link to the <a href="">original full-size picture</a> for the most daring. <br><br>  On Chinese sites, such devices cost about $ 107.  In Russia, Rovercomputers plans to sell something similar under the brand name roverpad at a price of 7.990 rubles.  On "Habr√©" was already a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/7days/blog/100297/">post with a video review</a> .  Perhaps the Roverpad will somehow differ, for example, the frequency of the processor and the refinement of the software, but externally the devices are very similar.  A more detailed comparison is beyond the scope of this review. <br><br>  Overall impression: if this tablet were brought to mind, I would have bought it.  But too much to bring to mind.  Wishlist List: <br>  1. Increased performance by increasing the amount of memory and processor frequency. <br>  2. Update Android from 1.5 to 2.x.  Better, of course, 2.2. <br>  3. The introduction of the "iron" buttons on the front panel.  "Swing" to give a volume.  Trackball is desirable. <br>  4. Phone, GPRS, 3G.  It is not expensive, but without it in any way.  WiFi in Russia is not so common as to position this tablet as a mobile device with Internet access. <br>  5. GPS.  If you have a module, you will get a convenient navigator. <br><br>  I hope that the Chinese comrades will listen and next time they will bring a more advanced prototype. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/101046/">https://habr.com/ru/post/101046/</a></p>
