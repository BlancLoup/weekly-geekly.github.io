  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Features of building a Wi-Fi network on innovative food production</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h3>  Prologue </h3><br>  The modern level of development of production technology, process automation, information services management and accounting on the one hand, a high level of internal and external competition, stricter requirements for product quality, cost optimization, the struggle for the end user on the other, raises a wide range of issues for manufacturers on comprehensive modernization production.  With such modernization, not only the technology, services, technical aspects, information environment, but also the psychology of the whole process (production) is changing.  Thus, the manufacturer tries to optimize the entire process, excluding the possible ‚Äúpoints of failure‚Äù at different stages.  As you know, a large percentage of failures are due to the ‚Äúhuman‚Äù factor, the more people in the chain of operations, the higher the likelihood of errors, damage to process equipment and as a result of marriage, downtime, disruption of delivery times, fines and so on. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In addition to ‚Äúmistakes‚Äù for food production, a person, as part of the production chain, strongly influences the biosafety factor of products.  And under unfavorable circumstances and violation of the technology "biofactor" can lead to the loss of entire batches of products already shipped.  Those.  exclusion of a person from direct contact with raw materials and its components directly affects the final quality of products, which in turn leads to a reduction in losses. <br><br>  But a simple modernization of production with the installation of robots, pipelines, automated warehouses, the deployment of automated accounting and control systems does not solve the whole range of tasks due to the following limitations. <br><br>  There is no ready-made solution for the full automation of production.  There are automated lines "pieces" of production, which operate within their technological and logistic tasks.  Managed by local systems and interacting with each other through some product cumulative buffer.  Often it can be automated lines from different manufacturers that do not have a single interaction protocol.  To unite such pieces of the technological chain, a single information platform (UIS) is created, which requires a physical transmission medium and interaction with all components of automated production.

      It is the features of the project and the construction of such a physical transmission medium will be affected in this article. <br><br>  A lot of technical literature, presented in the vast expanses of the Internet, tell us about the seemingly well-established and undoubtedly correct algorithms (action planes, techniques - call it what you want :)) to build this or that network infrastructure.  However, in practice, any technique must be very carefully adjusted to specific requirements, conditions and circumstances of the production of works of each specific project.  In this article we want to talk about how you can achieve success by adapting theoretical knowledge to specific conditions and create a system that fully meets the stated requirements of the customer. <br><br>  The discussion will focus on building the network infrastructure of Russia's first robotic sausage factory.  Immediately, we note that this publication will not be filled with many theoretical calculations that led to the only correct solutions; we will take a look at the design process from a practical point of view. <br><br>  The most interesting and complex tasks that we needed to solve: <br><br><ul><li>  Provide Wi-Fi a network of office premises of the plant.  As part of this project, the customer abandoned the local network ports in the workplace - employees must be mobile. </li><li>  Provide wireless WI-FI network of industrial premises of the plant for the operation of technological equipment, including robots, shuttles, transporting products between parts of automated lines. </li><li>  Provide a wired network for industrial controllers of various local automated systems and other technological production areas. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/an/2i/lq/an2ilqjoj50rltbic1bbwggltzi.jpeg"><br>  <i>The robot shuttle transports the frame with products</i> <br><br><h3>  Preparation for design </h3><br><h4>  Wireless Client Settings </h4><br>  At the very beginning of designing a wireless network, we were guided by the fact that a wireless network is built not just for ‚Äúdevice operation‚Äù, but for transferring data from specific applications and services.  That is why you need to take into account the capabilities of wireless interfaces and features of the client equipment (transmitter power, supported frequency bands, channels, etc.) in order to ensure the necessary minimum requirements for client applications for bandwidth and network delays. <br><br>  As part of this project, we have divided the main wireless network consumers into 3 groups: <br><br><ul><li>  Data collection terminals </li><li>  Shuttle robots </li><li>  Office workers laptops </li></ul><br>  The approximate requirements for the minimum necessary bandwidth and latency of data collection terminals and laptops of office workers have long been calculated and known.  But with the mysterious robots it was somewhat more difficult.  A dry response was received from the manufacturer for a request for a wireless data network: 500kbit / s, &lt;300ms delay. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hz/mv/ip/hzmvipuja266my-oxjgli80xnco.jpeg"><br>  <i>Shuttle robots on charge</i> <br><br>  We found out that all hosts have a remarkable characteristic - they support operation in the 5 GHz band!  In coordination with the customer, we decided that we would design the network taking into account the use of only this range, which made life much easier for us. <br><br>  <b>Designing a wireless network is necessary, first of all, based on the requirements of client applications and the capabilities of the client's wireless interface.</b>  <b>Otherwise, in the end, you get either a highly redundant solution or a solution that does not meet the requirements for a WLAN.</b> <br><br><h4>  Plans and drawings - the key to a healthy design </h4><br>  The process of designing a Wi-Fi network continued with a detailed study of both the plans and the object itself.  Very often, at the start of the design, the engineer is faced with a situation that there is no construction readiness at the facility, and this is not just the absence of false ceilings and plasterboard partitions, but a partial or total absence of walls, floors, parts of supporting structures. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lc/7t/5o/lc7t5oxnpehhrk9u6dc5u2k3aca.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/q8/f6/96/q8f696bpw2zsj6qczi99vryi1la.png"><br>  <i>The state of the object at the design start stage</i> <br><br>  Therefore, for successful work it is necessary by all means to seek from the customer architectural plans, sketches of equipment placement, engineering communications data.  In addition to plans, it is necessary to work closely with Customer‚Äôs technologists to understand technological processes so as not to miss important details.  Often, customers ignore requests for details, but in our case, the maximum comprehensive information from the customer was provided. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yj/p5/bj/yjp5bjyfxtb3ijcoezotmx2zhfc.png"><br>  <i>An example of a "bad" floor plan</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/w5/nz/wj/w5nzwjjyddrl4khusjs2ofp1b_s.jpeg"><br>  <i>An example of a ‚Äúgood‚Äù floor plan</i> <br><br>  "Correct" plans provide information on the placement of obstacles, structures, equipment, type of building materials.  All this allows to evaluate the factors affecting the propagation of the radio signal.  For large projects, the availability of such source data allows you to optimize the technical solution and take into account the influence of the physical environment on the installation sites of access points, their number, type of antennas to be installed. <br><br>  As an example, which reflects the need for an integrated approach to the study of the premises - the story associated with this remarkable technology viewing gallery. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lp/4t/he/lp4then1vc2hiqcht6p4whpkxgw.jpeg"><br><br>  In one of the places the access point is at a distance of 3-4 meters from the gallery, it can be seen through the glass.  At first glance, glass and glass have a relatively small absorption coefficient and the signal level in the room should be acceptable.  However, in a more detailed analysis it turned out that a fireproof stained-glass window was installed: reinforced filled aluminum frame and water-proof fire-glass.  In practice, through this design on a mobile phone, there is no signal from the access point at all, a laptop with a more sensitive receiver shows a signal at the level of -80Dbm <br><br>  <b>At the stage of starting the design of a facility under construction, it is extremely important to have a complete visual representation of all the rooms, taking into account the installation of all technological equipment (by the way, it can be located in the most unexpected way: on the floor, on the ceiling and many more).</b> <br><h4>  The plant is not your office ... </h4><br>  One of the main differences between industrial premises and office premises from the point of view of designing a wireless network is the working conditions of access points and other network equipment.  Understandably, server and telecommunication facilities are prepared taking into account the requirements and conditions of equipment operation.  But the production facilities, even within the framework of the same plant, have completely different environmental parameters and it is necessary to be extremely attentive to the installation of network equipment in them. <br><br>  In our case, the temperature was all right, it did not go beyond the range of -5 +30, but all process rooms are cleaned by high-pressure systems. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hh/px/vu/hhpxvu-p7l3g36sky8xlar8basc.jpeg"><br><br>  In this regard, whatever access points and antennas would be chosen for work in technological rooms, it was decided to install them in a sealed radio-transparent box. <br><br>  The attentive reader will immediately notice: why do you need to make such a ‚Äúset‚Äù of the access point and the thermobox, when can you use access points with IP67 security level?  Of course, we have not forgotten that each manufacturer has such, but we chose the option using a hermobox, because: <br><br><ul><li>  at the time of design, all protected Cisco access points (the equipment of this particular manufacturer was planned for use) required additional import permits, except for the IW3700 model (its cost was much higher than budgeted).  Registration of permits and delivery time of "protected" access points did not fit within the tight deadlines of the project; </li><li>  budget savings: a kit consisting of an access point 2702E and a hermobox came out cheaper. </li></ul><br>  <b>At the production facility, one should be attentive to the working conditions of the access points, taking into account the completely different characteristics of the premises (humidity, temperature, dust, etc.).</b>  <b>You can solve the problem of protection not only blindly following the manufacturer's recommendations - to use protected access points.</b>  <b>This option is not always possible and rational in the framework of the implementation of a project.</b> <br><br>  <b>In the battle of the telecommunications engineer and production technologist - the latter is always right.</b> <br><br>  Available places to install access points - another important point, which at the initial stage of the design must be clearly defined.  On complex technological objects, in addition to the installed equipment, there are also a lot of communications - electricity, water, air ducts.  Many of them are detrimental to the spread of the wireless signal. <br>  In our case, robots-shuttles were added to all of the above, which transported products from cooking sites to drying and fermentation chambers.  This is not a statically installed object, but a mobile process equipment.  It was very important to find out: where do they go?  What is the maximum height of the shuttle with the frame?  How far from the walls are the transport routes?  A general understanding of the whole process of their work was very useful and it would be good to see this action live.  But bad luck: there were no such plants in Russia at that time.  The open spaces of the Internet and the most popular video hosting of the planet was to help us - it was possible to build ideas about robots and understand where to place our access points. <br><br>  Often, at such sites the placement of access points is limited.  It is not always possible to install an access point in a place that is optimal for signal propagation.  In addition, it was necessary to satisfy the customer's requirement for resiliency in case of failure of one of the access points. <br><br>  <b>If you do not understand in detail the configuration of the premises and the process, you can get problems in the form of transfer of one or many access points.</b>  <b>And this is not just to be removed and outweighed: these are new technological openings, problems with eliminating the consequences of old openings (in the food industry, special attention is paid to them due to problems of corrosion, rust formation, and foreign flora), the transfer of the SCS point.</b>  <b>No arguments that Wi-Fi should work here and an access point installed in a dialogue with production technologists will not work if it really interferes with the installation of production facilities and units.</b> <br><br>  <b>What if something refuses ... !?</b> <br><br>  Another important condition for designing WLANs on this not simple object is fault tolerance.  Any failure in the absence of redundancy can lead to stoppages in the production process, which is not permissible.  The need for resiliency was exacerbated by the functioning of robots-shuttles.  They receive tasks via Wi-Fi networks, and also send parametric data to an automatic control system, for example, the weight of the frame being moved, the point of location, the battery charge level. <br><br>  The radio environment was designed in such a way that in case of failure of one of the access points, the adjacent ones provided the coverage area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe failed point with a signal level at the receiver of at least -75DBm. <br>  This design solution imposed some limitations and difficulties: <br><br><ul><li>  firstly, it was necessary to abandon the directional antennas (a much larger number of access points would be required, besides, the antenna price is much higher than standard omni); </li><li>  secondly - to put up with the imposition of frequencies from different points in some areas. </li></ul><br>  As for the second limitation: here we once again tested in practice all the delights of designing a Wi-Fi environment in the 5 GHz range.  Since the radio waves of this range propagate to a smaller distance than at 2.4 GHz, and there are more non-overlapping channels, this made it possible to avoid strong interference and interference. <br><br>  We went further and reserved WLANs in such a way that in case of failure of the telecommunication node, the network continued to operate in the normal mode ‚Äî adjacent access points were connected to different telecommunication nodes.  Within one telecommunication node, access points were distributed to different switches.  And of course, all other network elements (routers, kernel switches, WLAN controllers) were also reserved. <br><br>  Power supply of wireless access points made from access level switches, equipped with two independent power supplies. <br><br>  Each switch power supply unit is connected to a separate power distribution unit that receives electrical energy via an independent cable line from a separate switchboard of the uninterruptible power supply system.  It is made with mutual redundancy of components and uses in its composition uninterruptible power supply units of modular type.  SBE receives electrical energy from two independent transformer substations of the plant. <br><br><h4>  Radio planning </h4><br>  The first stage of radio environment planning - a predictive radio survey, was performed using the Ekahau Site Survey Pro software.  It should be said here that the success of a predictive radio survey largely depends on the correctness of the chosen obstacle parameters (walls, volume objects such as racks, shelves, and others), as well as the correctness of the room rendering.  Many objects have a complex architecture and therefore the reliability of the data obtained in this calculation is in great doubt. <br><br>  In practice, due to the complexity of the structures of an industrial enterprise and the various materials used in construction (for example, the drying chambers are made of metal sandwich panels), you could only rely on the program method of planning a Wi-Fi environment only partially: ‚ÄùPlacing access points, determine their approximate number.  This data is enough to start the design of engineering systems. <br>  But as soon as the construction readiness of at least part of the facility allowed us to perform a radio survey on site (pre-deployment survey, or as it is called, AP-on-a-stick), we moved to the site.  There was no time to wait for the facility‚Äôs complete readiness, it‚Äôs time to decide on the final composition of the equipment and order it.  The deadline for the project has not been canceled. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/av/3_/iq/av3_iq3w8iq2lizf5su8gbwbkag.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bx/60/xt/bx60xt3zjm2bwwmigunttt7va1g.jpeg"><br><br>  Having made measurements in several typical places, it came to an understanding of how to locate access points over the entire object.  By the way, the number of access points decreased in comparison with the originally planned by 15-20%. <br><br>  <b>You can rely on software radio modeling only when you have experience designing Wi-Fi in similar environments and with similar network requirements.</b> <b> pre-deployment site survey           .</b> <br><br><h3>   ! </h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After receiving the long-awaited equipment, without losing a single day, we sent access points to installers, to mount a large number of access points at a construction site, where besides you many more different contractors are difficult. That room was closed, then other equipment was being installed in it and it was impossible to work in parallel. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In parallel, configuration and installation of network switches, routers, WLAN controllers was carried out. Some telecommunication equipment installation sites did not have construction readiness, on the other hand, process equipment specialists already required a network for tests. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Throughout the facility we installed 14 telecommunication cabinets. Switch ports ensured the operation of not only access points, but also technological equipment.</font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rf/jb/qh/rfjbqhv3z0snlhulvfk3zlgrlye.png"><br> <i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Mounted Telecom Cabinet</font></font></i> <br><br><h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> An example of technological interaction between different automated systems </font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> A simplified typical example of the direct interaction of different automated systems through various physical means of transmission is loading the frame with the products into the drying and fermentation chamber: </font></font><br><br><ul><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> At the final stage of transporting the frame with the products, the robot shuttle reports its location to a single information platform (UIS) (via WiFi). </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> The UIS issues a command to the drying chamber controller (by wire) to open the chamber. </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Having received confirmation from the controller (by wire) that the camera is open, the UIS issues a command to the shuttle robot (via WiFi radio channel) to move inside the camera. </font></font></li><li>     -,    ,      ( )   80%   (    ). </li><li>     ,     - ,     (  WiFi)  -       . </li><li>    -          ( )         . </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fx/ft/iz/fxftizcekup25m75ydihkbyucva.png"><br><br><h2>  Summary </h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The design and implementation of LAN and WLANs, as well as engineering systems, took 8 months.
