    <div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/9-/te/db/9-tedbnhcpj-lbyr0sza_xb3ks4.jpeg"></div><br><h2>  When did everything right: 5 successful ICOs </h2><br>  <b>Spectrecoin</b> <br><br>  Spectrecoin is a cryptocurrency platform in which the ShadowCash protocol is used as the basis, ensuring maximum anonymity of transactions.  The system is based on the mechanism of consensus Proof-of-Stake v3, that is, the owners of tokens will receive a reward for the activity of their wallets, eliminating miners from the main work. <br><br>  Spectrecoin uses an energy-saving verification algorithm, which, according to the developers, will make the network environmentally friendly (will not harm the planet with a large expenditure of energy). <br><br>  And recently, platform developers presented an advanced HD wallet that allows participants in a transaction to communicate with each other in an encrypted chat and create HTML tabs.  During the ICO, which lasted a month, a little more than $ 15,000 was raised. <br><br>  <i>ROI: +60 800%</i> <br><br>  <b>Neo</b> <b><br></b> <br>  Neo is the first decentralized cryptocurrency platform with open source and blockchain.  Previously, it was known as Antshares, but in August 2017 the company conducted a rebranding.  In addition, the developers of the Chinese startup have improved the blockchain node, updated the technical documentation and switched to the NEO 2.0 smart contract system. <br><br>  Some fans of cryptocurrency called Neo "Chinese Ethereum", but this is not entirely true.  If, in the case of Vitalik Buterin's brainchild, you need to know the Solidity language for programming, then you can use Java, C / C # or GO for Neo. <br><br>  Despite the fact that the platform itself was involved in the ICO and in October 2015 collected more than $ 500,000, its creator Da Hongwey recently supported the Chinese government in the matter of <a href="https://moscow.blockchainconf.world/ru/article/ombudsmen-boris-titov-predstavil-tsentrobanku-proekt-po-regulirovaniyu-kriptovalyut-78413%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_campaign%3Dreview-13-11">prohibiting the primary placement of coins</a> . <br><br>  <i>ROI: +83 800%</i> <br><br>  <b>Ethereum</b> <br><br>  Ethereum is an open software platform based on <a href="https://moscow.blockchainconf.world/ru%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_campaign%3Dreview-13-11">blockchain technology</a> that allows developers to create and deploy decentralized applications.  Its authors were among the first to use ICO to create their system. <br><br>  The team successfully raised $ 18 million in US for 42 days.  And although this is not the most successful ICO in terms of funds raised (the same DAO raised $ 150 million), Ethereum‚Äôs ROI is one of the highest. <br><br>  <i>ROI: +96 300%</i> <br><br>  <b>Iota</b> <br><br>  IOTA is an M2M transaction oriented platform.  The main goal of the system is to maintain the machine economy by providing flexible payments. <br><br>  In 2015, IOTA conducted ICO and broke into the ranks of cryptocurrency leaders, representing a solution to many problems for the Internet of things.  For example, in the blockchain, you need to pay commissions to miners or holders of a share in order to confirm transactions, while in IOTA, users themselves confirm the transactions of other users. <br><br>  The platform also allows micropayments in real time, and instead of the blockchain, it uses DAG, a directed acyclic graph technology, where each transaction confirms one or more previous transactions, thus forming a "tree", unlike the blockchain, where each transaction carries information about all previous . <br><br>  <i>ROI: +96 800%</i> <br><br>  <b>Nxt</b> <br><br>  Nxt is an advanced blockchain-based platform that not only has its own NXT cryptocurrency, but also provides system users with a powerful modular set of tools for creating decentralized applications.  Like Spectrecoin, Nxt uses the principle of Proof-of-Stake, that is, evidence of depositing funds for a certain period of time. <br><br>  In terms of ROI, Nxt has come off strongly from its closest pursuers - Ethereum and IOTA.  ICO Nxt was conducted back in 2013, during which the creators raised $ 17,000, which does not look as impressive as the millions in other projects, but then it was enough to launch the platform. <br><br>  And in 2016, system developers presented their subsidiary Ardor with their own ARDR token. <br><br>  <i>ROI: +354,000%</i> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ih/sl/fm/ihslfmzpjys15gse9vx0yr_z4xy.jpeg"></div><br><h2>  Full disaster: 5 failing ICO </h2><br>  <b>SunContract</b> <br><br>  SunContract is a blockchain platform that allows you to buy and sell electricity.  The creators are confident that in this way they <a href="https://moscow.blockchainconf.world/ru/article/budut-li-rossiyskie-chinovniki-izuchat-blokcheyn-78203%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_campaign%3Dreview-13-11">will be able to solve many problems</a> in the modern energy sector. <br><br>  Now, intermediaries between producers and consumers of energy are utility companies, but SunContract developers want to assign this role to the blockchain.  Thus, it will reduce costs and directly connect the consumer with the manufacturer. <br><br>  The creators of the platform held ICO from June to July 2017 and collected more than $ 2 million.  That's just from that moment on, the price for one token has dropped and now amounts to 0.00000837 Bitcoins <br><br>  <i>ROI: -50%</i> <br><br>  <b>CoinDash</b> <br><br>  CoinDash is a platform for cryptocurrency traders, consisting of the so-called Market Network system, which should bring together investors, social networks and a cryptocurrency market.  Platform users can use predefined contracts for automated trading and investment. <br><br>  The creators launched ICO on July 17, 2017 and for the month collected more than $ 15,000,000. However, the company's ROI is now quite low, and the token costs 0.00001379 Bitcoins. <br><br>  <i>ROI: -60%</i> <br><br>  <b>Wagerr</b> <br><br>  Wagerr is a completely decentralized blockchain platform for sports betting.  The creators of the system offer users to bet in cryptocurrency, and in return promise anonymity and security of transactions. <br><br>  Since ICO (and it was held in June 2017), the ROI has dropped significantly, and now one WGR platform token costs 0.00002646 Bitcoins. <br><br>  <i>ROI: -75%</i> <br><br>  <b>Gilgam</b> <br><br>  Gilgam is a Ethereum based platform designed primarily for DOTA2, League of Legends, Counter Strike: Global Offense players, Call of Duty, and so on.  The goal of Gilgam is to eliminate cheating on in-app purchases. <br><br>  Gilgam conducted ICO from June 20 to July 20, 2017 and sold off more than 100 million GGS tokens.  That's just from that moment on, the price for one token has dropped approximately 280 times, and now the cost of one GGS is 0.00055 Bitcoin. <br><br>  <i>ROI: -80%</i> <br><br>  <b>Memessenger</b> <br><br>  The name of this startup speaks for itself - this is the <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/smileexpo/blog/294703/">instant messenger</a> in which, instead of the usual typing, the developers offer to chat with stickers and memes.  Memessenger appeared as an offshoot from another project - ‚ÄúEpic Messenger Game‚Äù. <br><br>  At the time of this writing, the startup is already conducting the third round of the ICO and raised $ 1,813.  It is worth noting that for the first and second stages the messenger attracted $ 150,000 and $ 250,000, respectively.  However, since the beginning of ICO, the cost of tokens has decreased almost 2000 times, and one MET is now worth 0.00000001 Bitcoin. <br><br>  <i>ROI: -95%</i> <br><br>  <i>Statistics and ROI indicators are taken from <a href="https://icostats.com/roi-since-ico">ICOStats</a> and <a href="https://www.cryptocompare.com/">Cryptocompare.com</a> portals on November 8, 2017.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/373989/">https://habr.com/ru/post/373989/</a></p>
