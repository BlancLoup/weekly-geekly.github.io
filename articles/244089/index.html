If this is the risk of accidentally putting a popular report in a small room and thereby creating a crowd and disgruntled people there. <br><br><h5>  How to solve? </h5><br>  Voting on Habr√©!  Under the cut - 22 reports (1-2 paragraphs about each) and voting at the end.  It is on the basis of its results that we will distribute the reports in halls of different sizes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cc9/18e/f7b/cc918ef7b7574422a53fd2ee4fcce84d.png"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h5>  Reports </h5><br><br>  <b>Dino Esposito - ASP.NET vNext: Microsoft</b> <br>  The ASP.NET vNext platform is a new foundation for web development through the Microsoft stack.  There is a strong deal between the platforms and the new platforms.  It‚Äôs surely more important than the future of ISVs. <br><br>  <b>Andrey <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/dreamwalker/" class="user_link">DreamWalker</a> Akinshin - Let's talk about different versions of .NET</b> <br>  A report for Middle and Senior .NET programmers on differences in runtime.  You will learn: <br><ul><li>  what makes MS.NET runtime different from Mono; </li><li>  what is the difference between different versions of the compiler and BCL; </li><li>  how the JIT compiler works on different architectures; </li><li>  what else to remember if you write cross-platform programs under .NET. </li></ul><br>  The report will be useful to all developers who at least once faced with the "unexpected" behavior of runtime. <br><br>  <b>Dmitry <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/mezastel/" class="user_link">mezastel</a> Nesteruk - How to use the new features of ReSharper efficiently and most effectively</b> <br>  ReSharper 9 adds support for Visual Studio "14", C # 6 and regular expressions, improved support for JS / TS and global changes (bulk fixes), added a new editor for code formatting and new navigation features.  In addition, all JetBrains .NET products are moving to a new common platform. <br>  Since ReSharper is a de facto industrial standard, the report will be useful to absolutely all .NET developers. <br><br>  <b>Timur <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/timyrik20/" class="user_link">timyrik20</a> Guev - C # 6.0: Roslyn and other innovations</b> <br>  The sixth version of the C # language continues the tradition of meaningful changes with each new version.  Following dynamic in 4.0 and async / await in 5.0 comes the open source compiler Roslyn. <br>  You will learn how the new compiler can affect the development of the language, how it will help the emergence of new tools for code analysis, how it will help use C # as a scripting language, and what other innovations have appeared in version 6.0. <br>  The report will be useful to those who follow the development of .NET-technologies and are going to switch to the new version in the near future. <br><br>  <b>Kirill Skrygan - Difficulties of creating large applications and their solutions on the example of ReSharper</b> <br>  We create applications with great functionality, and therefore we have to solve complex tasks: optimization of dynamic memory allocation (‚Äúmemory traffic‚Äù), synchronization of threads, taking into account the responsiveness of the user interface, optimization of caches. <br>  You will learn about: <br><ul><li>  our experience with NoSQL databases; </li><li>  performance tools (DotTrace, DotMemory, Windbg, DotPeek, .NET Memory Profiler, ...); </li><li>  errors associated with the allocation of unnecessary memory; </li><li>  non-trivial memory allocation cases; </li><li>  synchronization errors; </li><li>  the intricacies of working with COM; </li><li>  nontrivial data structures and much more. </li></ul><br>  The report will be useful to all who have to optimize their applications: both by the number of operations per second (throughput) and by the response time (latency). <br><br>  <b>Nikita <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/kekekeks/" class="user_link">kekekeks</a> Tsukanov - Using Linux as a platform for server-based .NET applications</b> <br>  Run on Linux server applications that use both ASP.NET infrastructure and popular frameworks like WebApi, NancyFx, ServiceStack.

After all, the less the API provides the CLR, the less you want to do something with it.  You will learn what lies behind this closeness, how the CLR works ‚Äúunder the hood‚Äù and see how to make the CLR not work the way it was originally intended. <br><br>  <b>Karlen <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/szkarlen/" class="user_link">szKarlen</a> Simonyan - Effective use of DLR</b> <br>  Dynamic Language Runtime began its story from the Iron-language platform (IronPython, IronRuby) as an attempt to bring dynamism to the CLR, becoming an integral part of the environment.  However, a detailed description of the internal device, resource consumption and examples of use, other than C # dynamic and scripting languages, is missing. <br>  In the report we will consider real examples of the use of DLR, and also answer the questions: <br>  when Boxing / Unboxing happens in the dynamic world; <br>  what method overload will be chosen by the runtime; <br>  what are the additional costs of memory, CPU resources for a dynamic code; <br>  How to call any methods with minimal costs without reflection and emit? <br><br>  <b>Andrei <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/violettape/" class="user_link">VioletTape Gordienco</a> - Refactoring code using PostSharp</b> <br>  New refactoring features using PostSharp.  What to do when the code still ‚Äúsmells‚Äù, and the possibilities of pure C # are already exhausted. <br>  You will learn: <br><ul><li>  how to use AOP with classic Gang of Four patterns; </li><li>  What possibilities for code modification does PostSharp provide? </li><li>  how to render the infrastructure code into separate entities; </li><li>  how to perform a fine architectural check at compile time. </li></ul><br>  This will allow you to better distinguish between business logic and infrastructure code. <br>  Report for experienced developers and technicals. <br><br>  <b>Dmitry Soshnikov - Functional reactive programming on F #: from analyzing twitter to programming a leap motion sensor and mobile robots</b> <br>  How to operate with ‚Äúlive‚Äù data streams with the same simplicity, as usually operate with data in memory.  You will become familiar with the concept of reactive programming and the functional language F # and see examples of how these tools can be applied. <br><ul><li>  for processing twitter streams; </li><li>  3D data streams from Kinect and Leap Motion sensors; </li><li>  and even to manage mobile work. </li></ul><br>  The report will be useful to anyone who is interested in functional programming and wants to learn how to apply it in practice. <br><br>  <b>Sergey Mikhalev - A True Story About Using SQL Server Change Data Capture</b> <br>  Surely everyone is familiar with this wonderful package manager.  But do you use it to the fullest?  Is the process of delivering dependencies automated and sending artifacts?  Is it an integral part of your continuous assembly? <br>  This report will show you how to use NuGet not only in Visual Studio to install packages, but how to use it as a dependency manager in your integration server, be it TFS, TeamCity or Jenkins, or even from the MsBuild command line. <br>  We will talk about the correct configuration of all participants in the continuous build ‚Äî the build tool, the binary repository, the build server, and of course, the dependency manager.  And, of course, where without a demo? <br><br>  <b>Roman Belov - Memory &amp; Performance.</b>  <b>Tips &amp; Tricks</b> <br>  You will learn about common errors leading to Memory Leak and Memory Traffic, which will allow you to make your code more reliable and more productive.  Among the mistakes that you hear about will be both common and quite tricky. <br>  The report will be useful as those who are faced with working with memory leaks and strange periodic subsidence performance. <br><br>  <b>Sergey Shkredov - What are the disadvantages of DSL and how to solve the same tasks using C # metaprogramming?</b> <br>  To automate the solution of repetitive tasks use libraries, and in particularly difficult cases - even small programming languages.  When developing ReSharper, we set and solved a lot of such tasks.  We came to the conclusion that in the overwhelming majority of cases only C # is sufficient, and the invention of your own languages ‚Äã‚Äãshould be avoided. <br>  You will learn how to express typical tasks using C # metaprogramming, what are the difficulties of developing and maintaining DSL programs and how, in this regard, I see the future of programming. <br>  The report will be useful to those who are faced with DSL in practice. <br><br>  <b>Mikhail Samarin - How to work with external devices and smartphone equipment on Windows Phone</b> <br>  You will learn how to use hardware APIs under Windows Phone and you can use the camera extremely easily, process live video stream, exchange data via Bluetooth with Lego Mindstorms robot, set up voice and touch controls. <br>  After the report, you can immediately start using the hardware functions of the smartphone, use them in both industrial and engineering hobby projects. <br>  The report will be useful to everyone who develops (or wants to develop) for mobile devices. <br><br>  <b>Mikhail Shcherbakov - What and how to protect in a .NET application</b> <br>  The main components of the security architecture.

The report for those who are developing or planning to develop security-sensitive applications thinks about the design of an extensible plug-in system. <br>  You will learn: <br><ul><li>  The main components of the security architecture. NET FW 4.0 and upcoming versions; </li><li>  type safety features in the CLR; </li><li>  about application domains (AppDomain) and Code Access Security; </li><li>  how, where and when you need to build your own sandbox (sandbox) to execute untrusted code; </li><li>  how it all works in ASP.NET; </li><li>  how code execution with limited permissions affects performance. </li></ul><br>  Together we will create an exploit for the .NET Framework, which will demonstrate the way out of the sandbox. <br>  The report will make your applications more reliable and secure.  It will be useful to those .NET-developers whose projects are associated either with the financial industry or with some personal data of users. <br><br>  <b>Dino Esposito - Challenges, Pains and Points of Software Development Today</b> <br>  Customers order and buy software.  It is a key to write successful software.  An analysis of the initial sprint zero ‚Äî it is more important that it can be used. <br>  It is easy to modify, adapt and even rewrite.  However, there is a need to change the dependency injection.  All good, except it's deadly wrong. <br><br>  <b>Dmitry Ivanov - Principles of building multi-threaded desktop .NET applications using ReSharper as an example</b> <br>  The report is based on the evolution of multi-threading understanding in the ReSharper team.  The goal is to share the experience gained and to protect listeners from generously scattered rakes on the thorny path of building a reliable multi-threaded architecture of a .NET application.  It will be told about the specifics of parallel programming tools in .NET, how, where and why they can be used in large projects. <br>  The report is designed for Senior .NET-developers who have to work with multi-pitch.

You will learn how FitNesse works, see examples of solving typical problems arising during application verification, and find out what pitfalls you can expect and how to avoid them. <br>  The report will be useful to all who seriously care about the quality of their products and especially to those who have formalized verification procedures in the project. <br><br>  <b>Roman Ageev - Fast business analytics with DevExpress Dashboard</b> <br>  When the developer faces the challenge of visualizing data for analysis, there are two possible solutions: <br>  Long - write everything yourself by implementing the visualization on third-party components. <br>  Dear - to implement the End-User solution for business intelligence and not to write code at all. <br>  At Developer Express, we tried to find a middle ground between these two extremes.  The result was the DevExpress Dashboard product, which, on the one hand, is designed as a set of components, which allows the developer to embed analytics into his application, and on the other hand, the process of creating visualization does not require coding and, therefore, is available for non-technical specialist.  DevExpress Dashboard is a cross-platform product designed to quickly create information panels - dashboards, which allows you to solve tasks such as grouping and aggregation of data, visualization using graphs and tables, filtering, navigation and support for data consistency. <br>  At the beginning of my report, I will tell you what difficulties a developer may encounter when starting to solve a data analysis problem.  Next, I will demonstrate the solution of a typical analysis task using the DevExpress Dashboard, I will show you how you can literally ‚Äúplay with data‚Äù by examining them from different angles.  In conclusion, I will touch on issues of performance, scalability and customization. <br><br><h5>  Voting </h5><br>  As always, at the end of the post golovalka.  People, please mark for the reports you would go to.  Since our halls are of different sizes (from 120 to 550 people), based on your answers, we will distribute the reports to the halls. <br><br><h5>  Just a few words about the conference </h5><br>  Who is interested in reports - here is the <b><a href="http://dotnext.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dblog%26utm_term%3Dhabrapost20141125_bottom_link%26utm_campaign%3Ddotnext2014moscow">site of our conference</a></b> .
