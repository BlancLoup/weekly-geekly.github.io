  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Is there an alternative to search engines</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I remember the first day when I connected to the Internet.  It was a modem, a busy telephone line, hourly pay and confusion - where to go and how to search.  When I got to an interesting page I did not read it, but at the same time I kept it in order to read it calmly.  Having disconnected from the first day from the network, I realized that there is an optimization task: how to spend enough money and find a lot of information?  The decision came almost immediately - I bought the ‚ÄúYellow Pages of the Internet‚Äù and, before going online, I prepared myself, carefully reading and writing out the addresses of interesting sites.  It was. <br><br>  Now it's different.  The Internet has long been unlimited and cheap.  But the search engines have usurped our right to choose, and we are accustomed to this and obediently obey this.  Search engines think for us, care about us, and without any remorse of conscience there form our understanding of the structure and content of the network.  Search engines quietly begin to sort out all the new features. <a name="habracut"></a>  For example, educational.  Schoolchildren are less likely to ask parents, who still send them to the Internet.  And here lies a bunch of dangers.  As an example, you can take a <a href="http://studlab.com/news/uchitel_i_uchitelnica_vot_ono_che/2012-09-03-500">selection of the</a> issuance of images in the request "Teacher", formed by Google.  The image of the teacher in the interpretation of the search engine is simply amazing.  A schoolboy will think that this is necessary.  And it seems to be a struggle with webmasters, leading active work on the artificial exchange of links.  The last update <a href="http://support.google.com/webmasters/bin/answer.py%3Fhl%3Dru%26ctx%3DNCUI%26answer%3D66356">to</a> webmaster <a href="http://support.google.com/webmasters/bin/answer.py%3Fhl%3Dru%26ctx%3DNCUI%26answer%3D66356">recommendations is</a> dated March 29th. <br><br>  But here, too, a seditious thought creeps in: what if this fight against webmasters-optimizers has a commercial connotation and, moreover, in its own favor?  I will quote from the above recommendations: ‚ÄúPlease note that paid links to the advertiser's site in pay-per-click systems do not pass PageRank and do not violate our recommendations.‚Äù This is why the question arises: is there an alternative to search engines?

      Here I must say that one of the reasons for the popularity of finding information through search engines is the simplicity of obtaining information - ‚Äúin three clicks: 1) launch the browser with the start page of the search engine;  2) enter the query and click the search button;  3) choose a site from the list and proceed to reading. ‚Äù <br><br>  The main disadvantage of search engines from the standpoint of the Internet community is that they belong to someone.  And the alternative can only be to create such a structure that does not belong to anyone, but rather belongs to everyone.  The global search engine should be something that you can try to express with the following definition: ‚ÄúRelevant peer-to-peer decentralized peering structure with prioritized subject nodes‚Äù.  An algorithm for constructing such a structure should be created and no one has the right to influence its work.  The webmaster who created the new site joins this system and ends up on its backyard with its website.  At the same time, a certain module is installed on the site with the visible part as a search line.  The module is responsible for the transition from the site to the relevant sites with which the site is integrated.  In other words: each site is endowed with search engine features.  As the authoritativeness of the site increases, its search functionality grows.  But at the same time there is some limiting power limit of the site, calculated on the basis of the current state of the network to maintain the equilibrium state of the system. <br><br>  Probably, these reflections are still quite soggy and should be subjected to fair criticism, and the idea itself should be thought out.  But with the increasing globalization of the search space, something needs to be done. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/175427/">https://habr.com/ru/post/175427/</a></p>
