The most interesting moments told by the heads of the CIA, the FBI, the NSA and military intelligence on this day sounded about the IoT and the terrorist attack in San Bernardino. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Although two months have passed since the Islamists <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5_%25D1%2583%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE_%25D0%25B2_%25D0%25A1%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD-%25D0%2591%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE">killed 14 people in a community center in San Bernardino</a> , an unknown encryption system still prevents FBI agents from gaining access to key evidence in the investigation. <br><br>  FBI Director James Komi said that agents were not able to do their job because in some cases the wide availability of powerful encryption tools made it impossible to access suspected messages, even by court order. <br><br>  At least the second time terrorist groups used encrypted messages, which, according to the head of the FBI, interferes with the investigation.  Earlier, James Komi reported that due to the use of FBI encryption, it was not possible to read messages between a suspect in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curtis_Culwell_Center_attack">shooting at a caricature exhibition in Garland</a> , Texas, and an unknown person abroad.

      But later, James Corney clarified that mainly local law enforcement agencies are confronted with the problem of encrypted messages, and not investigations against terrorism at the federal level.  These are phones that the FBI cannot access because of the encryption technologies used, which contain evidence in cases of homicide, kidnapping and even the causes of car accidents. <br><br>  From the scanty good news that came out of the report - the delight of intelligence from the possibilities obtained from the technology of "Internet of Things". <br><br>  More and more devices in homes are connected to the ‚ÄúInternet of Things‚Äù: household appliances, such as refrigerators, thermostats, dishwashers, home security systems (including video cameras), coffee machines are connected to the Internet in order to allow consumers to more conveniently manage their devices .  But more than once security experts say that devices on the market often have a weak level of protection, and demonstrate the possibility of hacking using the example of a <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/08/24/smart_fridge_security_fubar/">Samsung smart refrigerator</a> or <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/259290/">Chrysler cars</a> . <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/739/575/cb7/739575cb76e1aac63d36a48e0bfa4d4f.jpg" alt="image" width="250" align="right"><br>  At least two publications on Geektimes / Habr were devoted to smart TVs - <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/270242/">Smart TV - may not follow.</a>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/270242/">But still ...</a>  Recently, Samsung TVs, the only ones among manufacturers, officially began to warn users <a href="http://theweek.com/speedreads/538379/samsung-warns-customers-not-discuss-personal-information-front-smart-tvs">about not disclosing personal information in front of TVs</a> . <br><br>  All this opens up new opportunities for intelligence services to receive intelligence information. <br><br>  James Klepper: <br><blockquote>  In the future, intelligence agencies could use the Internet of Things to identify, supervise, monitor, track and locate recruitment sites, or to gain access to networks or user credentials. <br></blockquote><br>  He does not specify which US intelligence agencies can use this opportunity. <br><br><blockquote>  The TV screen worked on reception and transmission.  He would catch every word if he was uttered in a not too quiet whisper;  Moreover, as long as Winston remained in the field of vision of the muddy plate, he was not only heard, but visible.  Of course, no one knew whether they were watching him for a minute or not.  How often and according to what schedule the police thought connects to your cable - one could only guess about it.  It is not excluded that they watched everyone - all day and night.  In any case, they could connect whenever they wanted.
