It is unclear whether this is permanent care or just a gesture to draw attention to his person, but the Australian has removed <a href="http://www.drcraigwright.net/">his site</a> with statements about his involvement in the creation of Bitcoin.  There is only one note left where Craig Wright says goodbye to his readers.

      Generally speaking, the Craig-Satoshi epic did not begin in May or April.  Back in <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/267348/">December last year,</a> several reputable publications pointed out that Wright may be Satoshi Nakamoto.  Moreover, even then the main evidence presented by Craig himself was pointed out by these publications.  And already in May, the Australian himself made a ‚Äúbreak in the covers‚Äù, although not very successfully. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  After the publication of a number of statements, as well as confirmation of his involvement in the creation of Bitcoin <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4hfyyo/gavin_can_you_please_detail_all_parts_of_the/d2plygg">by</a> Gavin Andresen, <a href="http://themonetaryfuture.blogspot.com/2016/05/how-i-met-satoshi.html">John Matonis</a> and <a href="http://financialcryptography.com/mt/archives/001593.html">Jan Grigg</a> , many experts in information security, cryptography, etc.  began to doubt the words of Craig.  After that, he himself promised to provide "irrefutable evidence" that he is Satoshi Nakamoto. <br><br>  But instead, he simply took ... and deleted the site, saying that he was "not strong enough" to resist all this squall of criticism from different people and communities.  At the same time, Craig said that he did not publish the very "irrefutable evidence", as this could harm Gavin Andresen and John Matonis, experts on Bitcoin.  How could this information hurt them?  Not entirely clear. <br><br>  He says that these specialists were not deceived by them, but "the world will not believe me now." <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/788/34a/a90/78834aa90382490db95be44f92a1b0df.jpg" width="850"><br><br>  The most interesting thing is that a day before his departure from the Network, Craig decided to conduct an experiment, which was to prove the fact of his possession of Satoshi's cryptographic keys.  BBC journalist Rory Cellan-Jones (Rory Cellan-Jones) <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-36213588">suggested that Craig's company</a> send any bitcoins from that very first Bitcoin block.  But the Craig team suggested doing something different. <br><br>  The journalist was asked to send some btc to the wallet specified in the very first transaction.  And then Craig would send the funds back to the journalist, proving that he really is the same Satoshi.  This would be the first transaction with the specified bitcoin address since 2009. <br><br>  This was done, the <a href="https://blockchain.info/address/12cbQLTFMXRnSzktFkuoG3eHoMeFtpTu3S">journalist sent 0.017BTC</a> .  John Mathonis and Gavin Andresen did the same.  And then the three of them waited.  And wait.  Then the phone rang, and the Craig team reported that the operation was paused, without explanation. <br><br>  18 hours later, the return payment was not received. <br><br>  And a little later, Craig deleted his site, saying goodbye to everyone.  Why did he do this and why did he not conduct the promised transaction?  The question is rhetorical. <br><br>  Oh, everything. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/368933/">https://habr.com/ru/post/368933/</a></p>
