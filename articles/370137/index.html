  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Samsung Gear IconX has bad Bluetooth and stutters too.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I am ashamed to admit, but I screwed up.  However, if this only concerned me, I would have forgotten about it and lived (further tormented) safely.  However, the story of wireless headsets has long gone beyond the personal space, and therefore I think that I have to say a few words about Samsung Gear IconX again. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ca1/692/ff4/ca1692ff43f4454098fd1937f464c2b4.JPG"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  And the following happened.  During the fascination with the niche "Truly Wireless Earphones", or "Real Wireless Headphones", the only instance that seemed to demonstrate an excellent connection, and was - an instance from Samsung. <br><br>  They came out, overtaking everyone, I tested them first, and, once in the field, they showed themselves perfectly in terms of Bluetooth.  Then about I wrote the first "unbox" <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/medgadgets/blog/278460/">here</a> . 
      <br>

      Later, in other headsets, a common problem emerged: in open spaces, on the street, I quote the developer Bragi: ‚ÄúBluetooth is not reflected from the walls, and the connection can be interrupted.‚Äù <br><br>  Always: both in mailings and in notes, and even here, my Samsung colleagues (with my words) singled out <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/283010/">in total</a> , indicating that there is no such problem in this headset. <br><br>  I thought the old memory also.  Once I almost burned the village.  In the heat I decided to burn some hay on the field, and - oh, a miracle!  - the fire instantly spread through the dry grass all over the field.  I ran back and forth, from the sandbox to the well, jumped over the fire, stomped, beat my shirt on the flashes for about fifty minutes.  There is nobody to call, it is an open field on the backside. <br><br>  In general, I already wanted to dial 112. However!  Then I had IconX in my ears.  Field, no reflection, running around.  And they worked perfectly: not a single failure.  On that and decided. <br><br>  My colleagues, again from my words, took this idea on faith, and we later with every comment about the wireless headphones said, they say, everyone has such a problem with the out-of-sync, but Samsung ... <br><br>  This morning, they happened to be in my home again, and I went on business.  Simply put: now we can say that not in 99 percent, but <b>in 100 percent of the headphones of this design, the signal is unstable</b> . <br><br>  As with all: if the smartphone in the back pockets of jeans, Samsung IconX behave monstrously.  Stuttering constant, songs rewind back and forth for a few seconds, and so on - on the list.  The position of the smartphone plays an important role: the deeper the Bluetooth antenna in your pocket, the worse for sound. <br><br>  And now, as a result, from the first place in my personal rating, they collapse to the very last, as to this trouble it is worth adding the still disgusting sound and the battery for an hour and a half. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e46/b09/7ed/e46b097ed37f4d3abab6e03bbb501cca.JPG"><br><br>  <b>Why is it important</b> <br><br>  Firstly, this post-apology to readers and colleagues, including there are many online stores that could notice our posts and make wrong conclusions, relying on other people's tests. <br><br>  Secondly, within our team, many comments on IconX were given from my words, and now, it turns out, there is no faith. <br><br>  Thirdly!  This reason - desynchronization and stuttering - <b>will not be the reason for the exchange of marriage</b> !  As you know, headphones in the list of goods of good quality, which are not subject to exchange and return, only in the case of marriage. <br><br>  Recently, as the search for the perfect headset continues, I called ReStore.  They seem to have an exclusive on Jabra, which is completely wireless.  And I asked if the problem I described would be a reason for the return.  Answer: No.  Bluetooth works, it means there is no marriage. <br><br>  <b>What is curious</b> <br><br>  I am not the only one who "made a blunder."  It is curious to read, for example, a review of the prominent modern "Samsunhofil" Murtazin, who, <a href="http://www.mobile-review.com/mp3/review/bragi-dash.shtml">testing</a> Bragi Dash, "put an end to" them because of Bluetooth. <br><br>  But at the same time, when I tested the Samsung IconX, the topic of Bluetooth synchronization <a href="http://www.mobile-review.com/accessories/review/samsung-gear-iconx.shtml">tactfully bypassed</a> !  And in the review of The Dash, he compares both pairs of sound quality and believes that it is comparable.  This is complete nonsense!  IconX sound disgusting. <br><br>  <b>What else is curious</b> <br><br>  Attempts to find the ‚Äúright‚Äù pair are also attempts to justify themselves somehow.  And here we become very superstitious.  At the last CES2017 we got a sample of Bragi Headphones (not to be confused with Dash). <br><br>  In the US, they worked perfectly! <br><br>  In Russia: the same smartphone, and a different quality! <br><br>  Difference: climate.  It was warmer there.  IconX I tested for the first time in the heat, now - minus 12. And although it sounds like nonsense, you begin to believe after a dozen headphones in such coincidences. <br><br>  However, I probably still feel guilty. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/370137/">https://habr.com/ru/post/370137/</a></p>
