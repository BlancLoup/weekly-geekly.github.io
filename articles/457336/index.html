Today I would like to write a mini post and answer the question - ‚ÄúWhy remove wisdom teeth if they don‚Äôt bother?‚Äù went wrong  Absolutely everyone had complications and now no deletions. ‚Äù  For a start, I would like to say that complications arose not from the fact of tooth extraction, but from how this removal was carried out.  This could happen for several reasons: <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><ul><li>  <b>During the deletion, something went wrong, and it was carried out incorrectly.</b> </li></ul><br>  For example, there could be a fragment of a root that could not be deleted.  Sometimes it really happens that a piece of the root is broken;  The doctor decides not to torture the patient any more, so as not to cause even more trauma.  Well, or not to touch the mandibular nerve, which runs very close to the roots of the 8th lower teeth, trying to get this piece out.  You ask - "How so?" And so.  If there was no acute, and even worse, purulent inflammation, and a small, immobile fragment of the root remains in the hole, then nothing terrible will happen, it will simply grow.  Naturally, I am not saying that broken roots should be left in the holes, without trying to remove them.  But if the doctor understands that ‚Äúpicking‚Äù can only hurt - this is not the worst decision.  I repeat, if <b>there was no</b> acute inflammation, otherwise the tooth should be removed completely, as it is infected. <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Sterility was not observed during the manipulation.</b> </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ii/ap/6k/iiap6kpu6zlohork2hq7qlecp0y.jpeg" alt="image">

      I don‚Äôt even speak about the processing of instruments and their sterilization, which should be perfect in every medical institution.  Elementary, the doctor may not wash his hands, already wearing gloves, grab hold of something, a telephone, a computer mouse, a bag of a patient who asked for it, lots of options, and then these hands in your mouth.  Asepsis and antisepsis has not been canceled. <br><br><ul><li>  <b>The patient ignored the recommendations given by the doctor.</b> </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kq/ca/vg/kqcavgzmesc-kpfzg7rr5ox2ktk.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  If all that I mentioned above, of course, can happen, although I think there are not many such doctors.  I at least hope so.  Some time ago, when I was working in a clinic that was located in the ‚Äúbedroom‚Äù district of the capital, it was not so rare for patients to come who did not fully comply with the recommendations. <br><br>  And they went to the bathhouse - ‚ÄúHow can it not be?  I've been going for 20 years!  Stable every week! ‚Äù <br><br>  And they were actively involved in sports - ‚ÄúHow could I stop training, because I am preparing for the Olympiad!‚Äù <br><br>  And as if they didn‚Äôt want to hear that it‚Äôs impossible to rinse <b>anything</b> !  - ‚ÄúAfter removal, I came home and immediately rinsed with a decoction of herbs, chamomile, oak bark, and infusions on deer horns to disinfect.  A neighbor advised me. ‚Äù <br><br>  Even an elementary unauthorized refusal of drugs prescribed by a doctor can lead to the emergence of a huge number of complications.  Ask - what drugs?  Classically, no one wants to drink antibiotics.  Although there are those who, at the first sensation of soreness in the throat, or the beginning of a cold, throw antibiotics like candy, not realizing that this is not an antiviral drug.  And then they do not want.  An antibiotic is prescribed for a reason, but in order to avoid complications.  The area where the 8th teeth are located is especially prone to inflammation and suppuration.  So, taking antibiotics after removal of retentive 8x teeth is mandatory.  If, of course, you want to take a chance and acquire a pharyngeal abscess, as one of my patients, who decided to ignore the recommendations, then please. <br><br>  So what am I talking about ... oh yeah.  Does not hurt! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xw/_b/lr/xw_blrvivdfkqczv8qlpw4tz1d8.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  Here is a vivid example of this, which may lead to a delayed removal of a wisdom tooth.  And it does not hurt!  The man turned to a completely different problem, discovered by chance when they took a panoramic picture of the teeth. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hj/oy/pb/hjoypbp-uyaaz-10m50awmhqjko.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  Due to the incorrect position of the 8k on the contact surface of the tooth number 7, a rather deep carious cavity has formed, extending deep under the gum. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/82/hx/cc/82hxcchwuuixizgytn4e8e1gz5u.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  The wisdom tooth was successfully removed, but the seven in line ... (8ka divided into three fragments - the crown part and two roots) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vf/3l/w-/vf3lw-wsou4-xruev-tatb4ihzw.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  It would seem a normal tooth.  "Well, caries, won, the seal is worth one, put another one, business something!".  Everything is not so simple, as the carious cavity goes deep under the gum, such teeth are not subject to treatment.  Why?  Because when setting the seal, the treated cavity must be dry.  To achieve this with such a defeat is impossible.  At least due to the fact that the gum contains "gingival fluid", which will constantly flow into this area. <br><br>  What to do?  Option one is tooth extraction and implantation.  Alas. <br><br>  Let's go further! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/x8/om/sv/x8omsvr4mhlrkk7yqzu3aekyfs0.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  What do you think the patient turned to?  No, not with wild pain or swelling, as many might have thought.  But with what - ‚ÄúEven though my food is clogged from the bottom right, take a look.‚Äù That is, the young man is only worried about the food being clogged ... just the food is clogged, Karl!  To the question, did it hurt?  The answer is - ‚ÄúNo, never hurt, and nothing bothered.‚Äù Well ... you already know the order of actions in this case.  Here you are - ‚ÄúI will wait until I get worried.‚Äù <br><br>  If you think that this is the worst thing that can expect you, how could it not be so. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bi/6-/vf/bi6-vfu8zk-zc92e810fhlhvzo8.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  These cysts (and this is not the largest) can grow in your jaw and do not bother you.  Naturally the tooth needs to be removed.  In order to avoid an increase in this neoplasm, and the occurrence of possible complications.  Before this, the channels in the adjacent 7th tooth should be treated, since its roots are in the lumen of the cyst. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/d3/hi/9h/d3hi9ho28ilirfqr-rkjwwi9bm8.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  Problem solved.  The patient is happy.  But all this could have been avoided by planning a check-up to the dentist. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cr/pi/ds/crpidsdj2i7ufmarzvojkfnem1k.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  Here is a picture waiting for us a year after removal.  All dragged on.  Everything is fine! <br>  And it could threaten both a fracture of the jaw, and a lesion of the mandibular nerve, which is accompanied by numbness of the lips and chin on the part of the causative tooth, and this numbness can last for a lifetime. <br><br>  The problem is that many do not go to doctors, even when it hurts.  Although, I do not think that this can be attributed to users of Habr.  But for a certain category of people it is rather difficult to convey that ‚Äúit doesn‚Äôt bother,‚Äù not an indication that everything is in order. <br><br>  There may be questions like, ‚ÄúI have a curve of 8k, but I need to delete it?‚Äù I will answer right away.  Wisdom teeth must be removed almost always!  All these "almost always" I have already described <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/455286/">in this article</a> , and how these teeth are removed - <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/455499/">in this one</a> .  Especially, when the 8s were cut through incorrectly or not at all. <br><br>  If all your wisdom teeth have "crawled out", do not be in a hurry to rejoice and think that all is well.  It may seem to you that they are in the correct position, but do not be lazy and go to the dentist, this can be a delusion. <br><br>  That's all for today, thank you for your attention! <br><br>  Stay tuned! <br><br>  Sincerely, Andrei Dashkov <br><br>  <b>What else to read about wisdom teeth and their removal?</b> <br><br>  <b>-</b> <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/455286/">Wisdom teeth: remove cannot be left</a> <br>  <b>-</b> <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/455499/">Removal of wisdom teeth.</a>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/455499/">How it's done?</a> <br>  <b>-</b> <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/456402/">Wisdom Teeth: Pull-pull</a> <br>  <b>-</b> <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/458218/">Maxillofacial surgery or not?</a>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/458218/">That is the question</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/457336/">https://habr.com/ru/post/457336/</a></p>
