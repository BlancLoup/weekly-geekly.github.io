  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Solution of the issue with an Internet in the country</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  As you know, the slow Internet acts as something especially harmful to the nervous system.  This article is based on its own history of numerous attempts to provide an acceptable Internet speed in the country. <a name="habracut"></a>  Of course, the operators are great, they are constantly expanding the network and the connection is getting better, but our place is in the lowland, beyond the forest, to the nearest tower about five kilometers, and to the one that ‚Äúshines‚Äù in my direction, in general, all eight. <br><br>  So, let's begin.  Good and high-quality Internet is an extremely necessary thing, since it is endless to fry kebabs and steam in a bath, without the necessary minimum of brain training - not 100% satisfying surroundings. <br><br>  Back in prehistoric zero, I remember how EDGE appeared and something like 80-120 kbps with a phone on the second floor and a bluetooth connection - this was the first small step in the feeling of "well, at least something."  Further, I remember a long-and-another and very expensive experiment with Skylink, which is ‚Äúsafe‚Äù, different from everyone, and at that time it had a ‚Äúlargest‚Äù coverage area in the Moscow region due to a signal with a relatively small number of megahertz.  But here I remember a very expensive joke with an endless upgrade.  Usually, you want more, more, more - it always looks like a challenge, for competition - first a modem, then a pigtail and an antenna, plus twisting it for a couple of days, reconfiguring from station to station - here, finally, I found why it‚Äôs bad again and further - better cable, higher antenna.  In general, Skylink is probably the only operator for whose equipment I spent more money than on communication.  I admit that selling antennas and a permanent upgrade is one of their marketing strategies.  In the end, the "ordinary" operators are all in the same conditions - the coverage area within the same standard under the same power conditions is similar.  And experimenters go to Skylink, who have a dozen or two weeks of free time lying around to spit in six months and forget about this catchy nightmare.  Although, a couple of years, at the dawn of the development of the rest, they probably provided something for speed, but apparently I met them too late.

      Then there was 3G and a mast for 10 meters with a panel antenna, which, along with unlimited internet from MTS, for a year pleased me with loading under ten megabits, especially when leaves are falling from trees and no signal appears at all from the grove of a neighbor opposite.  Completely, you know, speed rose to 15-18.  I used to remember one antenna and, taking into account the difficulty of dismantling the mast, I did not climb there as often. <br><br>  To the question: ‚Äúhow much should the Internet be?‚Äù, I will answer: ‚Äúunlimited‚Äù, especially today.  Firstly, a video for children, and secondly, downloads in the evening.  Providers boast - as many as 30 GB! .. What is 30 GB?  Well, if the week of Dasha and the Blue Tractor from YouTube.  This is nothing.  No, of course someone has enough DVD and mail checking once a week, but there should be no limits for the media player and the IP camera. <br><br>  LTE with Megaphone and Yota were connected later.  Forced necessity when disconnecting an option from MTS.  The speed is two times less than in 3G from MTS.  This LTE story lasted four years.  It immediately became clear that there would be no other technology besides wi-fi connection via any provider, and I was closely engaged in setting up.  The alternative was found with channels 25 and 60 mbps, but the initial payment of more than 12 thousand rubles, while Yota at the very least gave out its 3-5 mbps with ping less than 30, was questionable.  And it‚Äôs not even a matter of money, but rather to be able to manage at least something that is practically impossible in the case of different companies that experiment in the field ‚Äî one can hardly count on a quick solution to the problem on Saturday night, if how are you in this area people five to seven.  In general, for Yota, another panel antenna was purchased and placed on the same mast.  The best and most expensive thick cable connected the E392 with my antennas, but the speed did not rise above seven Mbps, it jumped to and fro, I calmed down on that. <br><br>  But a couple of months ago, the availability of free time also came together and was tired of two or three Mbit through speed tests with a caching wheel in the middle of the screen.  To which I just did not sin - maybe wi-fi fails (neighbors also have routers) and so on.  The operator says "no, no download, everything is fine."  MIMO is in their technology standard, and I have two antennas ... <br><br>  In general, there are many companies offering "wi-fi in the country."  I think at least 95% of them also provide a connection through a cellular network and set up a regular router.  The user receives his wi-fi and something somehow works there.  This service costs with an antenna, a mast and setting in the region of 15 thousand rubles.  I personally rummaged dozens of resources on the topic and did not find any practical recommendations for configuring antennas other than describing the MIMO technology.  Nowhere not.  The best confirmation will be the statistics of speed measurements on 2ip.ru, where out of twenty results on the first page, no one has more than 14 Mbps, and the standard is up to ten. <br><br>  The whole thing, in fact, turned out to be in the polarization of the antennas.  I have two antennas, one vertical polarization, the other is set to horizontal.  Normally in this position did not work, until I, creaking with my heart and laziness, once again did not lower my mast from heaven and deployed antennas at 45 'from the vertical.  And ... oh, a miracle!  I don‚Äôt know when they turned it on - maybe recently, or maybe I just overlooked and was tortured to turn the mast back and forth without turning the antennas around its axis except at 90 '(‚Äúvertical and horizontal‚Äù is written everywhere), but I got a straight line statistics at the level of the twenty on the incoming channel and five outgoing, as the operator confirmed - Yota has such restrictions. <br><br>  So, the updated instruction: <br><br><ul><li>  mast 8-10 meters - 1 pc. </li><li>  Panel antennas - 2 pieces </li><li>  mast provider that shines in your direction </li><li>  antenna set at an angle of 45 'from the vertical </li><li>  trial and error (two options) connect pigtails and see the speed </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/eb/32/59eb3294e87cb649147213.jpeg"><br><br>  The comments are as follows: <br><br><ul><li>  it is possible the second floor, just to be sure that to the station the direct visibility </li><li>  It‚Äôs convenient to find the right direction on the Yandex Map, and tie it to the surrounding terrain - turn of the road, angle of the fence, etc. </li><li>  You can choose the correct tower according to the coverage map - there are usually three sides there are obvious increases in coverage - do not direct directly to the nearest station, it is better to choose the one that works in your direction and the open space goes to the nearest serious obstacle </li><li>  I have two antennas, but maybe one and one will work, if initially MIMO, but I can not say anything here. </li></ul><br>  When properly connected, see the photo below.  It is impossible to guarantee that the conditions are similar and the trees will not interfere, but I have not looked at the nearest station eight kilometers away, but across the field, so the forest behind it no longer interferes with the signal. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/eb/32/59eb3299d1e96823054499.jpeg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/340708/">https://habr.com/ru/post/340708/</a></p>
