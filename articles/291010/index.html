One can be sure that many Chinese companies, both private and public, are already revising their strategic imperatives in accordance with government priorities and the local potential of industries will grow exponentially.

      At the same time, based on previous experience, it can be assumed that success is fundamentally not achievable in all industries at once, and it is quite possible for Chinese companies to become world leaders only in some industries at the end of the estimated period, through natural selection. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  You can also assume that consumers will get the maximum benefit during the implementation period of the program, because companies would still, even so, go to the designated sectors, but the Chinese government has already triggered the simplest ‚Äúmagic kick‚Äù mechanism.  Unlike our country, state initiatives are somehow easier implemented (for example, someone can remember - we had a program like this - Electronic Russia, so far we are dragging documents and certificates with papers). <br><br>  So what are these coolest key industries of the future?  Many of them have been mentioned before, and some have already drunk on the edge, but let's move on from words to deeds and list them. <br><br><h4>  Information technology (yes, cap!) </h4><br>  Beijing, realizing the strategic importance of IT, stresses the need to separate China from foreign technologies and the importance of independence in the digital world.  It is worth expecting significant investments in the manufacturers of components and electronics in general, and Chinese companies with their inherent diligence and diligence will swallow a lot of international technology companies. <br><br><h4>  ACS (automated control systems) and robotics </h4><br>  China is already a leader in the budget and middle segment of the industry.  Further more.  Increased attention to robotics will contribute to increased productivity, as well as raise the intellectual threshold for entry into the business and craft.  In the process of implementation we expect an increase in the flow of goods in this segment. <br><br><h4>  Aerospace Engineering </h4><br>  China seeks leadership in the field of satellite technology and hopes to increase the production of domestic passenger aircraft, although now the entire industry is largely dependent on foreign technology. <br><br><h4>  Marine engineering equipment and high-tech maritime transport </h4><br>  Now the volume of current investments in infrastructure in the South China Sea is much more than 5 years ago.  Hope for growth and strengthening of the export sector in this space.  Let us not forget that investors from the east have already come to the Black Sea, and I have no doubt that the desire to gain additional experience in the implementation of such projects came along with the money. <br><br><h4>  Railway equipment </h4><br>  China is already exporting its high-speed rail trains to Malaysia, Russia and other countries.  Beijing clearly wants to increase its competitiveness in this area, including through the implementation of infrastructure projects of the ‚ÄúOne Belt, One Road‚Äù initiative. <br><br><h4>  Energy saving and alternative energy vehicles </h4><br>  The combination of the priority "green direction" and long-standing unmet ambitions of recognition from the whole world of the Chinese automotive industry. <br><br><h4>  Power equipment </h4><br>  The main goal for China is energy efficiency.  Already, they are the largest or one of the <s>energy</s> consumers of <s>energy</s> resources.  It is not difficult to guess that without slowing down the growth rate of the economy of the "eastern dragon" it is impossible to reduce energy production, given the current state of technology in this industry. <br><br><h4>  New materials </h4><br>  The government of the PRC considers this industry as a key one, giving it the true meaning of the term ‚Äúinvention‚Äù.  If China becomes the leader in inventing and commercializing new materials, the phrase ‚ÄúChinese innovation‚Äù will cease to be identical to ‚ÄúChinese fake‚Äù.  Will go into oblivion "Made in China", as a shameful stigma. <br><br><h4>  Medicine and medical devices </h4><br>  Chinese medical device manufacturers have shown excellent growth in recent years, and are already starting to export their products.  With further government support, this process will accelerate significantly. <br><br><h4>  Agricultural machinery </h4><br>  Another sector where China seeks to improve efficiency and create an export platform.  However, judging by the automotive industry, it is not so easy.  The country in which so many people live is simply obliged to be the world's agricultural giant. <br><br><h4>  Some examples from the initiated program </h4><br><ul><li>  Increased research and development ( <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259D%25D0%2598%25D0%259E%25D0%259A%25D0%25A0">R &amp; D</a> ) expenditure as a percentage of sales from 0.95% to 1.68% </li><li>  The annual increase in labor productivity by 7.5% up to 2020 and by 6.5% per year after </li><li>  Reducing energy consumption per unit of value added by 35% by 2025 </li><li>  Reducing water consumption per unit of value added by 35% by 2025 </li></ul><br><br>  When I write this, I somehow feel uncomfortable, because they will succeed.  China, suffering from the oppression of sanctions, is still one of the richest countries in the world.  So why do not we think about the future, and if we think about it, then we don‚Äôt realize it, and if we realize it is not the way it should?  What is wrong with us? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/291010/">https://habr.com/ru/post/291010/</a></p>
