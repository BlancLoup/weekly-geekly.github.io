Now I want to write not a technical article, a reference or a trick, but I want to share my thoughts and observations. <br><br>  Historically, my main technical activity is not Data Mining or iPhone development, but C # and the .NET platform, i.e.  with all confidence I can be called the "Microsoft guy".  I worked with products and technologies of different companies, and I can say - I like .NET, I like C # and I like Microsoft.

      Every day I read blogs, try to follow the news, communicate with developers who write on other technologies.  And every day I more and more <s>fall into someone</s> amazed at what is happening around me.  Namely, <b>well-established stereotypes and negative attitudes towards Microsoft</b> .  Expressions such as "melkomyagky", "melkosoft" entered the lexicon of many people who use them not always to the point. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  We will not go far - take everyone‚Äôs favorite habr: <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/microsoft/66850/">Buy Zune HD - Get Microsoft into Debt</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/open_source/63363/">Why free software should not depend on Mono and C #</a> </li><li>  etc. </li></ul><br>  If you search the network, then such messages are not uncommon: <br><ul><li>  <i>I could never understand why microsoft has so much of an orgasm from a ribbon, I‚Äôll watch a video at home, suddenly <s>I</s> get <s>zazombirus</s> .</i> </li><li>  The page with the avatar of the windows emblem, the comment: <i>‚Äúand the avatar will also hang, like the Windows?‚Äù.</i> </li><li>  etc. </li></ul><br>  Linux users give out something of a type (those who have not read, follow the links, read): <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/linux/65982/">Linux helps in life</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://grigorievs.blogspot.com/2009/07/lunux.html">Another reason why Linux rules</a> </li><li>  etc. </li></ul><br>  Now let's see more. <br><br>  <b>Windows only for housewives</b> .  IT industry has long been a "thing in itself."  Despite the development of technologies, products, a large availability of books, courses, an IT specialist must have very much knowledge, and every day the level of the entry point to the industry is increasing.  A variety of technologies, solutions requires to be ‚Äúon the alert‚Äù all the time, to learn and improve, therefore this expression is at least outdated. <br>  <b>Internet Explorer 6</b> .  The fight against IE6, namely the counters until the end of the era of IE6, banners on websites with threatening names, throwing maker-ups where necessary and not necessary remind me of naughty children.  You do not like IE?  <i>Use other browsers.</i>  <i>If you are a layout designer, then do your job and do not breed whining.</i>  It seems that only the makers of the sea do not have the necessary work, while others have all the feng shui. <br>  <b>Paid Windows, free Linux.</b>  Well, let's forget for a moment DreamSpark, BizSpark, MSDN AA, Microsoft Partner Program, TechNet subscriptions, discounts up to 80%, a bunch of torrents, forget that buying a washing machine, you pay <i>with money</i> , not with a rating on torrent.ru or megabytes Internet service provider.  But after all licenses for linux also need to buy? <br>  <b>Awful windows, beautiful mac</b> .  A typical Mac user reaction: I‚Äôm willing to pay $ 1,000 for a beautiful design instead of this buggy Windows PC or "yes, it's expensive, but worth it."  Hmm ... a mediocre Mac costs twice as much as a PC-based ‚Äúspacecraft‚Äù that can hang only if you ask for it very much.  No, I do not agree, <i>it is not worth it, if you do not need it for specific purposes</i> .  And if you have a Bentley, then this is not a reason to <s>blot to</s> call the owners of a Mercedes.  By the way, there was one good comment on Habr√©: <i>‚Äúis it worth a few computer reloads per year $ 1000‚Äù</i> ?  I think that it is not worth it if you are a person who is sober-thinking and don‚Äôt waste money right and left.  In addition, there are people (I, for example) for whom beauty and design are not basic to the computer.  I <i>have</i> to work behind a poppy and I cannot say that I like it.  IMHO, like everyone else. <br>  <b>Windows vs.</b>  <b>Mac: development</b> In order to run an iPhone application, you need to have a Mac (at least $ 700 for a Mac Mini, $ 1500 for a Mac), an iPhone ($ 600), $ 99 at least to give away an iPhone Developer Program, get a bunch of certificates, install them, register the application on site, download a certificate for it, sign the application and only then start.  This will take you 1-2 months (if you're lucky).  In order to run a .NET application, you need Visual Studio Express (for free) and 5 minutes of time.  In my opinion the difference is obvious. <br>  <b>Microsoft is a monopolist.</b>  What we see at the moment: <br>  Microsoft Outlook: 80% of the market is a monopolist, Gmail (8%) - but they are great! <br>  Windows: 80% of the OS market is monopolist, Linux (1%) - but they are great! <br>  IE: Microsoft - monopolist, Ghrome, Opera, FireFox - well done !!! <br>  Search: Google (81%) - <b>well done</b> , Microsoft (8%) - hmm ... freaks ... <br>  The market of expensive computers: Apple (91%) - great guys, PC - hmm ... also freaks ... <br><br>  Apple lowered the price of the iPhone to $ 100, and in Japan - in general they give in addition - super, Microsoft sells Zune for ridiculous prices - let's ruin Microsoft.  Google launches new Linux-based OS - cheers, comrades, Skynet is canceled, Microsoft is freaks (just in case) ... <br><br>  One-sided somehow it turns out ... <br><br><h4>  Open source </h4><br>  Attitude towards Microsoft due to open source has always been negative.  But my open source attitude has always been cold, and here is why. <br><br>  First of all, what motivation can there be to write an open source project: <br>  * the desire to bring the world something useful and free.  As a rule, after one or two months of work ‚Äúfor an idea,‚Äù enthusiasm somewhere abruptly disappears.  As an option, it can be a simple project as a self-advertisement. <br>  * failed commercial project.  Well, yes, we‚Äôve been bombarded with a project, there‚Äôs no use to it, let's at least push it on it - we‚Äôll post it in open source, let‚Äôs show how cool we are. <br>  * grants.  Well, yes, for the won grants need to report.  We did work on N kilobaksov, reported for N * N.  But we are good - all posted in open source, use. <br>  * well and the most interesting - big sponsors.  Who is the author of the largest open source projects?  That's right, Google, Apple, Sun, and other whales.  Microsoft is somehow out of business ... <br><br>  Open source is a new marketing ploy that makes it very easy and clear to annoy competitors.  Imagine you wrote a startup, started selling your products.  What competitors do is produce the same or even much worse product and distribute it to everyone for free with the source code.  And you find yourself at the broken trough, because <i>they have the opportunity to write open source projects and distribute it for free, but you do not</i> . <br><br><h4>  Let's talk about good </h4><br>  And now let's talk about the good, which is forgotten all the time: <br><ul><li>  Microsoft sponsors many sites, the most famous of them is <a href="http://codeplex.com/">codeplex</a> .  The quantity and quality of projects, the development of the community and the level of technical support are simply amazing. </li><li>  MVP (Most Valuable Professional) on all kinds of forums, sites give absolutely free advice </li><li>  created a huge number of courses, including video courses </li><li>  Microsoft Press Monthly Free Books </li><li>  conferences like PDC, MIX, REMIX, Platform, etc. </li><li>  free developer days, weekly conferences, workshops, webinars, trainings, contests (of which only the Imaging Cup costs) </li><li>  opportunity to develop partners, etc. </li></ul><br>  <i>Neither Google, nor Apple, nor Sun have anything similar either in scale or level (at least in Ukraine).</i> <br><br>  Well and time such booze has gone, some rhetorical questions: <br><ol><li>  Why does everyone have extra $ 1000 ($ 600 for the iPhone) for a Mac and no $ 100 for a licensed Windows? </li><li>  Why does everyone put hakintoshes, download programs with Cydia, but consider it right to spit in the face of those who use pirated Windows every time? </li><li>  Why are there no alternative search engines on the Google homepage? </li><li>  Why doesn't Apple remove Safari from Mac, iPhone and for a long time did not allow alternative browsers in the AppStore? </li><li>  How can people who have ‚ÄúLinux - rox!‚Äù In the profile (with an error) call me a religious fanatic?  ( <i>‚ÄúDo these people accuse me of fascism?‚Äù ‚ÄúUral Dumplings‚Äù)</i> </li></ol><br><br><h4>  Afterword </h4><br>  I want to thank everyone for the interesting conversation, but it was still interesting :) <br><br>  I want to answer a few questions asked during the discussion and add my comments. <br><br>  <b>Rudeness.</b>  Unfortunately, <i>some</i> people were able to learn complex technologies, learned to work on the command line, write crutches for IE6, but did not master even the elementary rules of etiquette and behavior, which is very distressing.  Basically I will not respond to these attacks, forgive. <br><br>  <b>Grammatical errors.</b>  Thanks for the indicated errors in the text.  I am also for literacy, but, as it seemed to me, for some it was a reason to get away from the main topic and show my great ‚Äúcorrectness‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>Competence.</b>  Of course, immediately many rushed to look for ‚Äúskeletons in the closet,‚Äù and shout with foam in their mouths that, they say, the author is a complete layman, etc.  and so on ... I rush to reassure you, I have little experience with different technologies and platforms - when I did the layout (hello layout makers!), and riveted PHP websites, and even wrote something on ColdFusion, now I also do development for mobile devices, including for the iPhone.  In any case, everything in the world is relative, only salary is fruitful :) <br><br>  <b>Microsoft User Group.</b>  For those who are not aware, the User Group is an informal community of programmers united by common interests.  In this case, common interests are information technologies.  If I had a profile in Microsoft Corp.  - believe, this article would not be here.  By this, I want to say that everything that is written here is my personal opinion, supported by real experience in communicating with different people (including within the User Group).  Once already remembered for UG, then I invite to our site - <a href="http://msug.vn.ua/">http://msug.vn.ua/</a> . <br><br>  <b>Open Source.</b>  No need to understand everything literally.  And I fully agree that there are wonderful examples of open source (by the way, not only WebKit and Mozilla, but also, for example, Mono and Moonlight), there are wonderful people and groups of people who do this.  But exceptions only confirm the rule. <br><br>  <b>"The Empire of Evil."</b>  I forgot to mention this phrase in my essay.  It resembles the title of a horror film or a sick fantasy of a person after overheating in the sun. <br><br>  Once again I want to clarify the main ideas: <br>  - on the face of "double standards" <br>  - besides Microsoft, there are other monopolists in one niche or another. <br>  - a negative attitude, <i>mainly</i> coming from Linux and Mac users towards Windows users.  The reverse is also true, but <i>to a much lesser extent.</i> <br>  - stereotypes need to be changed <br><br>  I will add a little article on the results of the conversation: <br><br>  <i>I thought there would be some interesting thoughts ... but quickly disappointed the fanaticism of the recording.</i> <br>  There is no fanaticism, just you want to see what you want.  This post is against fanaticism. <br><br>  <i>I am the same .net developer but I hate microsoft for the fact that everything is done through the ass and I hate C # for it becomes the # 1 language for the intimacy</i> <br>  Are you exactly .NET developer? <br><br>  <i>But for some reason, the author distorts the facts so that it seems that Microsoft is being scolded and Apple is patted on the head for it.</i> <br>  No, I do not distort.  They scold others as well, but very carefully and culturally. <br><br>  <i>The author, your year of birth - 1993, I guess?</i> <br>  No, they did not guess. <br><br>  <i>Open source is all the brightest, purest, and good things that all rotten capitalism still remain in our world.</i> <br>  Do you still believe in Santa Claus? <br><br>  <i>I hope that you will survive this article with a sign in "+" karma and we will still see articles on data mining!</i> <br>  Do not worry, survive.  There will be more articles on Data Mining :) <br><br>  <i>And yet what a brave man.</i>  <i>Bring such a topic to the public, which, for the most part, uses Gmail (8%), Linux (1%), hrome, Opera, FireFox, simply adores Google (81%) and treat Apple well (91%).</i> <br><br>  What is the strength in, brother?  In truth, brother (s) <br><br>  Special thanks to adequate people who clearly and without rudeness substantiated their point of view. <br><br>  For all companies, the main goal is to make a lot of money, any company is trying to protect their rights and neutralize competitors.  <i>Voila, hello rial world!</i>  There is no need to turn the IT sphere into politics, because in politics only the politicians themselves emerge as winners. <br><br>  <b>So let's not hate each other, ‚Äúmeasure with iPhones,‚Äù but we will help each other!</b>  <b>Everyone has the right to choose and this right must be respected.</b> <br><br>  And I would like to finish with Linus Torvald‚Äôs phrase: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/open_source/65279/">"hatred of Microsoft is a disease</a> . <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/open_source/65279/">"</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/66883/">https://habr.com/ru/post/66883/</a></p>
