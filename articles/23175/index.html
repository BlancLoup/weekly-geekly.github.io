Scientists have already created a replacement for him, endowing his new development with lightning speed, which allows you to download a movie in seconds. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  With a speed of 10,000 times faster than a conventional broadband connection, the future network will be able to transfer the complete collection of Rolling Stones from Britain to Japan in less than two seconds, reports the British newspaper <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/science/article3689881.ece">Times</a> . <br><br>  Being the newest development of CERN, the European Center for Nuclear Research, which was at the origin of the Internet, the new Network has enough bandwidth to transmit a holographic image, support the simultaneous play of hundreds of thousands of players and reduce the cost of high-resolution video to the cost of a local call.

      David Britton, a professor at the University of Glasgow and a leading figure in the development of the project, is confident that the new network technology will change the society beyond recognition.  ‚ÄúWith such computing power, future generations will have the opportunity to cooperate and communicate in ways that people like the old generation, like me, cannot imagine,‚Äù says the professor. <br><br>  The power of the network can be assessed this summer after the Large Hadron Collider (BAC) is commissioned.  This new particle accelerator is built to explore the origins of the universe.  It is to ensure the ability to process the entire data stream coming from the LHC.  and this Network was developed, which will be launched simultaneously with it. <br><br>  Scientists began to develop the Network seven years ago, when they realized that the LHC would annually generate data that can fit on 56 million ordinary compact discs.  This meant that by transferring such a volume of data, the global Internet could easily be plunged into a global collapse. <br><br>  The problem is that the modern Internet has emerged as a set of cables and network equipment, most of which were intended for telephone communication and did not have a large bandwidth.  In turn, the new network is built using a specially designed fiber optic cable and modern routers, which means the complete absence of components that can slow down data transmission.  To date, 55 thousand new network servers have been installed, the number of which will increase to 200 thousand in the next two years. <br><br>  The network will temporarily work in parallel with the Internet, linking together 11 research centers in the USA, Canada, the Far East and Europe.  Each such center will integrate other research organizations that will connect to it using their own high-speed institute networks. <br><br>  According to Jan Byrd, project manager for high-speed computing at CERN, the new network technology will make it possible to completely abandon the use of personal computers and store all information on the Internet.  ‚ÄúUsing such a network will lead to the ubiquitous use of the so-called‚Äú cloud computing ‚Äùwhen people have access to information stored on the Internet from anywhere,‚Äù says Byrd. <br><br>  The fact that computers connected to such a network can exchange information with lightning speed allows scientists, whose research is impeded by a huge array of raw data, to use thousands of computers around the world, which will significantly speed up information processing.  So, scientists have already managed with the help of the Web to develop a new medicine for malaria, which required more than 140 million components to be analyzed.  When using computers connected via normal Internet, this process would take 420 years. <br><br>  Despite the fact that the Network itself will not be accessible to ordinary Internet users, many telecommunication companies have already adopted the advanced technologies used in it.  One of the most effective is the technology of the so-called dynamic switching, when a special dedicated channel is created for a user who downloads a large amount of data, such as a movie.  Theoretically, the use of dynamic switching allows you to download a movie in 5 seconds, instead of three hours. <br><br>  <a href="http://psymusic.nnm.ru/novyiy_internet_pozvolit_skachat_dvdfilm_za_5_sek">a source</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/23175/">https://habr.com/ru/post/23175/</a></p>
