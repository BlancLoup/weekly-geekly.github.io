OAuth can connect 2 services among themselves, each of which has its own user base - I call them ‚Äúsocial‚Äù in this case.  When you start working with OAuth, the first feeling is that the protocol is very complicated and redundant.  In this article I will try to explain the basics of OAuth in human language. <br><br><h2>  Sample Cross Authorization </h2><br>  Let's go back to the year 2005 and imagine that we are writing a social network.  It has a form for importing contacts from the GMail address book.  What do you need to access GMail contacts?  Of course, the username and password of the box.  But if we ask to enter them on our site, the user will suspect that something is wrong.  Where is the guarantee that we do not save the entered passwords on the server?  Therefore, we want the password to be entered <i>only on the GMail website</i> , and after that access to contacts through the GMail API is provided to our social network (perhaps for a while). <a name="habracut"></a><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td>  It looks like this: the form consists of a single button - ‚ÄúImport contacts‚Äù.  After clicking on it, the user will temporarily redirect to GMail, where he enters his username and password (and if he is already authorized, he does not enter anything).  Next, the user is returned back to our site, where the script already gets the opportunity to download contacts through the internal GMail API. </td></tr></tbody></table>  We agree on terms. <ul><li>  <b>Consumer</b> : consumer;  script processing forms of import contacts in the social network. </li><li>  <b>Service Provider</b> : data provider;  GMail, which contains address book data that is interesting to the consumer. </li><li>  <b>User</b> : a user who has an account with both a Consumer and a Service Provider. </li><li>  <b>Protected Resource</b> : personal data;  contacts from the address book on GMail (i.e. Service Provider resources). </li><li>  <b>Provider API</b> : GMail API, allowing any script to get contacts from the GMail address book. </li></ul><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td>  <i>Now I ask you to close the upper part of the screen with a sheet of paper and, as an exercise, answer the questions: who is the Service Provider?</i>  <i>What is Protected Resource?</i>  <i>who is Consumer and how is it different from User?</i>  <i>Where is the API located?</i>  <i>Further in the article we freely operate with these terms.</i>  <i>If you are not well-versed in them, there may be problems with understanding.</i> </td></tr></tbody></table>  <b>The OAuth task</b> is to ensure that User has the opportunity to work on the Consumer service (on the social network) with the protected data of the Service Provider (GMail), entering the password to this data exclusively on the Service Provider, while remaining on the Consumer site.  Not so difficult, right? <br><br><h2>  How is OAuth different from OpenID? </h2><br>  OAuth is often called the ‚Äúprotocol for robots,‚Äù as opposed to OpenID, the ‚Äúprotocol for users.‚Äù  Do not confuse them! <ol><li>  <b>OpenID - protocol for accelerated registration.</b>  OpenID allows a user to get an account on any service without entering a password if he is already registered somewhere else on the Internet.  (And then you can log in to the service without having to enter the password, being authorized ‚Äúsomewhere‚Äù.) For example, if you have an account on Yandex, you can ‚Äúlog in‚Äù with it to any service that supports OpenID authorization. </li><li>  <b>OAuth is a protocol for authorized access to a third-party API.</b>  OAuth allows the Consumer script to get limited API access to the data of a third-party Service Provider, if User gives the go-ahead.  Those.  this is a means to access the API. </li></ol><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td><h2>  Police analogy </h2><br>  Imagine that you are an employee of the Criminal Investigation Department, looking for tips in the case of the theft of WebMoney for the 1973rd year.  Agree on terms: <ul><li>  <b>OAuth Consumer</b> : Criminal Investigation. </li><li>  <b>User</b> : Criminal Investigation Officer. </li><li>  <b>Service Provider</b> : Crime archive file. </li></ul><ol><li>  OpenID: The employee of the Criminal Investigation Department (User) comes to the Service Provider, presents an Authorization at the entrance and searches the cards for information on the spot. </li><li>  OAuth: A Criminal Investigation Officer (User) calls Consumer directly from Work (Service Provider).  He gives his last name;  if they recognize him (Authorization), he asks for a list of all crimes for the year 1973 (API call). </li></ol>  As you can see, OpenID and OAuth are different things.  OpenID allows you on-site access to some resources.  OAuth provides a piece of information from a remote service through an API. </td></tr></tbody></table><h2>  Plan for this article </h2><br>  Before turning to the main part, let's see how we are going to move. <ol><li>  Consider the problems that arise when the "manual" implementation of cross-authorization. </li><li>  Let's talk about what an ‚Äúapp‚Äù is and who a Consumer is. </li><li>  Let's touch upon the basics of cryptography. </li><li>  Denote the demo application that we will write in this article. </li><li>  We will be defined with the test OAuth server on which we will experiment. </li><li>  Let's go through all the steps of the OAuth protocol and give the source code of the script. </li></ol><h2>  About the invention of bicycles </h2><br>  A good way to understand something is to do it yourself by stepping on all the rakes that were laid out.  Now we will reinvent the wheel: let's try to imagine how we would solve the problem of interaction between Consumer and Service Provider without any standardized protocols.

      First, let's write the very form of importing contacts with GMail: <table cellspacing="1" cellpadding="6"><tbody><tr><td>  <b>Code Listing 1: Contact import form</b> </td></tr><tr><td><pre>  &lt;form action = "http://gmail.com/auth.php?retpath=http://oursocialnetwork.ru/import.php" method = "get"&gt;
   &lt;input type = "submit" value = "Load Address Book" /&gt;
 &lt;/ form&gt; </pre></td></tr></tbody></table>  Next, we ask the GMail developers to ensure that when the user transitions over the URI /auth.php, he would be given an authorization form (in our cycle world, GMail is written in PHP).  After successfully entering the password, the user must redirect to the site whose URL is specified in the retpath parameter.  Also, an additional secret key must be transferred to the URL, which can already be used to access the GMail API. <br><br>  So, after entering the password, the user will return to our website at the following address: <table cellspacing="1" cellpadding="6"><tbody><tr><td>  <b>Code Listing 2: Bicycle return cycling address</b> </td></tr><tr><td><pre>  http://oursocialnetwork.ru/import.php?secret=Y49xdN0Zo2B5v0RR </pre></td></tr></tbody></table>  And from the /import.php script, we will access the GMail API, transfer the Y49xdN0Zo2B5v0RR key to it and load the contacts: <table cellspacing="1" cellpadding="6"><tbody><tr><td>  <b>Code Listing 3: Running a bicycle API method</b> </td></tr><tr><td><pre>  $ contacts = $ gmailApi-&gt; getContacts ($ _ GET ['secret']); </pre></td></tr></tbody></table>  Well, let's consider now a rake (because it will be too late to count bumps). <br><br><h3>  Rake first: substitute return address retpath </h3><br>  Well, of course, you guessed it that the attacker would first of all place a link on his website <table cellspacing="1" cellpadding="6"><tbody><tr><td>  <b>Code Listing 4: Link on the attacker's website</b> </td></tr><tr><td><pre>  http://gmail.com/auth.php?retpath=http://hackersite.ru/save.php </pre></td></tr></tbody></table>  and make you click on it.  As a result, he will receive a secret key that GMail returned, and therefore your contacts: <table cellspacing="1" cellpadding="6"><tbody><tr><td>  <b>Code Listing 5: Bike secret in return address</b> </td></tr><tr><td><pre>  http://hackersite.ru/save.php?secret=Y49xdN0Zo2B5v0RR </pre></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>  Second rake: "eavesdropping" the secret key </h3><br>  Suppose we somehow protected the retpath, and now it can only point to our site.  But the problem with the secret parameter remains. <table cellspacing="1" cellpadding="6"><tbody><tr><td>  <b>Code Listing 6: Bicycle return cycling address</b> </td></tr><tr><td><pre>  http://oursocialnetwork.ru/import.php?secret=Y49xdN0Zo2B5v0RR </pre></td></tr></tbody></table>  Secret can be seen from behind or intercepted by listening to WiFi traffic.  Or, on your website, there will someday be a XSS vulnerability that allows you to "slacken" the secret key.  Having a secret value, an attacker can read your address book.  So, you need to protect the secret from interception (ideally - do not pass it through the URL at all). <table><tbody><tr><td></td><td>  <i>It must be remembered that the secret key is transmitted not only in the URL, but also when calling API methods.</i>  <i>There is also an interception.</i>  <i>Of course, using SSL here helps.</i> </td></tr></tbody></table><h3>  Third rake: too many redirects </h3><br>  If each API call requires a different secret, then we will have to organize as many redirects to the site of the Service Provider, as we have calls.  With intensive use of the API, it works very slowly, and it is inconvenient in order ... <br><br><h3>  Fourth Rake: Consumer bad identification </h3><br>  GMail, of course, wants to know who uses its API.  Allow access to some sites and prohibit others ... So, when forming a request in the form of importing contacts, the Consumer (site) should be ‚Äúintroduced‚Äù by the Service Provider (GMail).  In our case, this function is partially performed by retpath (the name of the site in it), but this method is not universal, since  The ‚Äúpresentation‚Äù mechanism should also be used when invoking API methods. <br><br><h2>  OAuth Foundation </h2><br>  It is noteworthy that there are still many ‚Äúunderwater rakes‚Äù.  I will not describe them here, because this rake lies in the Mariana Trench (deep, 10920 m).  The description of vulnerabilities would have to spend a dozen pages.  So I‚Äôll go straight to the description of OAuth, where all the problems have been solved. <table><tbody><tr><td></td><td>  <i>There is a wonderful series of articles about OAuth: <a href="http://hueniverse.com/oauth/">Beginner's Guide to OAuth</a> (in English; from the author with the talking nickname hueniverse).</i>  <i>His study will take you about 4 hours if you are completely unfamiliar with the topic up to this point.</i> </td></tr></tbody></table><h3>  Application = Consumer + API Access </h3><br>  When working with OAuth, it is important that the term Consumer is not limited to ‚Äúsite‚Äù.  Consumer is some <i>application</i> , and where it is located is not so important.  Examples of real life Consumers: <ul><li> Script of the import form of contacts from GMail (see example above). </li><li>  An iPhone application that allows you to tweet. </li><li>  Rectangular widget on your site, which displays the latest chat messages and have the opportunity to write a new one. </li></ul>  But from one OAuth of a porridge you will not cook.  Indeed, all that OAuth provides is the ability to log in to a remote service provider (Service Provider) and make authorized API requests.  It does not matter how this API is organized: it can be pure SOAP, REST-approach, etc. The main thing is that each API method accepts special parameters for input, transmitted according to the OAuth protocol. <br><br><h3>  Token = Key + Secret </h3><br>  One of the principles of OAuth says that no secret keys should be passed on in open requests (in the example above, we considered why).  Therefore, the protocol operates with the concept of Token.  The token is very similar to the login + password pair: login is open information, and the password is known only to the sending and receiving parties.  In OAuth terms, the login equivalent is called Key, and the password analog is called Secret.  The situation when Secret is known only to the sender and recipient, but no one else, is called Shared Secret. <br><br>  So, if Consumer and Provider somehow agree among themselves about Shared Secret, they can openly exchange corresponding keys (Key) in the URL without fear that interception of these keys will be dangerous.  But how to protect the URL from Key from a fake? <br><br><h3>  Message = Document + Digital Signature </h3><br>  ‚ÄúDigital Signature‚Äù sounds scary, but in fact it‚Äôs quite an obvious thing.  When you sign a document with a pen, you certify that this document was written by you and not by someone else.  Your signature is ‚Äúadded‚Äù to the document and goes with it in the ‚Äúone set‚Äù. <br><br>  Similarly, a digital signature is added to some data block, certifying: the one who generated this data does not impersonate another.  <i>A digital signature does not encrypt a document, it only guarantees its authenticity!</i>  The Shared Secret allows to sign, which is known to the recipient and the sender, but no one else. <br><br>  How it works?  Let our $ sharedSecret = 529AeGWg, and we told him in a whisper in his ear to the receiving party.  We want to send the message "My Phone 1234567" with guaranteed protection against fraud by the attacker. <ol><li>  Consumer adds a digital signature to the message, in general - <pre>  $ transfer = $ message.  "-".  md5 ($ message. $ sharedSecret);
 // $ transfer = "My Phone 1234567".  "-".  md5 ("My Phone 1234567". "529AeGWg") </pre></li><li>  The Service Provider takes the data, breaks it back into 2 parts - $ message and $ signature - and does the exact same operation: <pre>  $ signatureToMatch = md5 ($ message. $ sharedSecret);
 // $ signatureToMatch = md5 ("My Phone 1234567". "529AeGWg"); </pre>  Then it remains only to compare the resulting value of $ signatureToMatch with what was in the received $ signature data and report about a fake, if the values ‚Äã‚Äãdid not match. </li></ol><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td>  <i>So, to form an MD5 signature, you must know Shared Secret.</i>  <i>(By the way, besides MD5 there are other irreversible hashing algorithms.) The attacker does not know Shared Secret, so he cannot forge the signature.</i> </td></tr></tbody></table><h2>  Demonstration of the work of OAuth on the example of a simple application </h2><br>  In order to "live" OAuth, we need two things: <ol><li>  The script that implements the client part of the protocol.  I wrote just such a small PHP script ( <a href="">link to zip-archive</a> ).  This is a widget that can be inserted into PHP sites. </li><li>  OAuth Test Server, where we can experiment.  For this purpose it is convenient to use RuTvit: there is a page <a href="http://rutvit.ru/apps/new">http://rutvit.ru/apps/new</a> , which allows you to add a test application in 30 seconds.  (By the way, the return URL in the form can be omitted - we still pass it from the test script.) </li></ol>  Looking at the code of the demo script and reading the explanations below in the article, you can understand the details of the protocol. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c51/cbd/a61/c51cbda6190e8fa9a21f255714d1e716.png" width="397" height="220"><br>  You can paste this widget to any PHP site by simply copying its code and correcting the layout.  All tweets from the <a href="http://rutvit.ru/">RuTvit</a> service are <a href="http://rutvit.ru/">displayed</a> , marked with the specified hash tag, and there is an opportunity to add new tweets (this is where OAuth is involved).  The widget uses API and RuTvit OAuth authorization, which, by the way, coincide with the standard of the Twitter API. <table><tbody><tr><td></td><td>  Currently, there is only one universal library for working with OAuth in PHP: <a href="http://oauth.googlecode.com/svn/code/php/">OAuth.php by Andy Smith</a> .  It has two drawbacks: it is written dirty, and it has not been updated for more than a year.  Links to other libraries are provided <a href="http://oauth.net/code/">on the OAuth website</a> , but these tools either require the installation of PHP extension, are either too raw, or have extensive external dependencies on other libraries (although the draft library for Zend Framework looks very promising).  So, as they say, ‚Äúthe mice cried, injected, but continued to eat the cactus‚Äù - we will use OAuth.php. </td></tr></tbody></table>  You can run this script on your test server.  For this you need to perform three steps: <ol><li>  <a href="">Download the script code</a> and deploy it to any convenient directory on the web server. </li><li>  <a href="http://rutvit.ru/apps/new">Register a new test application</a> on the OAuth server. </li><li>  After registering the application, replace the OA_CONSUMER_KEY and OA_CONSUMER_SECRET parameters in the script with the values ‚Äã‚Äãreceived from the server. </li></ol><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td>  <i>The script is specially written without OOP and as much as possible "in the forehead."</i>  <i>Two goals were pursued: a) to achieve brevity and clarity of the code, b) to make the code run parallel to the storyline in the article (hence this finite state machine and switch ... case).</i>  <i>Oh, and one more.</i>  <i>The OAuth.php file is not self-written, it is the Andy Smith library unchanged (enjoy).</i> </td></tr></tbody></table><h3>  Application registration and its parameters </h3><br>  Let's talk about where applications come from and how the Service Provider will find out about them.  Everything is quite simple: Service Provider has a special application registration form that anyone can use.  Here is an example of this form: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/875/5d0/aa2/8755d0aa2f06387bf98acd6edac2a21c.png" width="368" height="224"><br>  After registering the application, you are given 5 parameters that are required to work with OAuth.  Here is what they might look like: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/936/05f/a89/93605fa89234aaaccea42140068a2704.png" width="410" height="91"><br>  Here, the Consumer key and Consumer secret are a kind of ‚Äúlogin + password‚Äù of your application (remember the above talk about tokens? This is just one of them).  Let me remind you that the Consumer secret is a Shared Secret, known only to the sender and the recipient, but no one else.  The remaining 3 values ‚Äã‚Äãdefine the service URL, the meaning of which we now consider. <table cellspacing="1" cellpadding="6"><tbody><tr><td>  <b>Code Listing 7: OAuth parameters and variable definitions</b> </td></tr><tr><td><pre>  &lt;? php

 define ("OA_URL_ACCESS_TOK", "http://api.rutvit.ru/oauth/access_token"); </pre></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>  OAuth = Fetch Request Token + Redirect to Authorization + Fetch Access Token + Call API </h3><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td>  <i>... or, translated into the great mighty:</i> <ol><li>  <i>Consumer application receives Request Token.</i> </li><li>  <i>The user is redirected to the site of the Service Provider and authorizes Request Token there.</i> </li><li>  <i>The Consumer application exchanges Request Token for Access Token.</i> </li><li>  <i>Consumer application makes authorized requests to the service API.</i> </li></ol></td></tr></tbody></table>  In the GMail example, we used 2 types of remote calls: a) redirection through the browser;  b) accessing the API from inside the script. <br><br>  And we revealed a number of security problems, which suggests that there should be more challenges.  This is what happens in OAuth: more intermediate requests from the Consumer script to the Provider operating with tokens are added.  Let's consider them. <table cellspacing="1" cellpadding="6"><tbody><tr><td>  <b>Code Listing 8: Handling state transitions via a finite state machine</b> </td></tr><tr><td><pre>  // To work with OAuth, we need 3 variables that save their values
