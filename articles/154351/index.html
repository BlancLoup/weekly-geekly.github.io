Now they faced a housing problem, changing.  I took them to help, climbed on the real estate sites, ofigel.  Ofigel from the price, it goes without saying.  But ofigel from the sites themselves.  After 2005, time seemed frozen. <br><br>  My writings have two goals: to discover a normal website for St. Petersburg real estate - suddenly there is one.  This is the main thing.  And the second goal - sometimes you sit on your ass, and everything seems to be ok ... until from the side you do not stick your nose in your ‚Äúwork‚Äù.  So, comrades who are engaged in bn, bkn, bsn, eip, emls, itak, these ‚ÄúInternet projects‚Äù are not normal, this is not even the day before yesterday. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><h5>  Here's how.  At least </h5><br>  Sites that I know: <a href="http://www.bn.ru/">bn.ru</a> , <a href="http://www.bkn.ru/">bkn.ru</a> , <a href="http://www.bsn.ru/">bsn.ru</a> , <a href="http://www.eip.ru/">eip.ru</a> , <a href="http://www.emls.ru/">emls.ru</a> , <a href="http://www.irr.ru/">irr.ru</a> , <a href="http://www.itaka.spb.ru/">itaka.spb.ru</a> .

      First of all, I will exclude design.  To me as a front-end spoiled by the bootstrap, they hurt the eyes.  Yes, the design is ancient, and apart from irr, everyone was still under i5-i6.  And javascript is crammed there like crutches.  That kind of hooked up jquery.  then some functions and getElementById, and also &lt;body onload = "..."&gt; ... <br><br>  Design is trivia.  Usability ... also small things.  Yes, the search form is not saved on eip, the ‚Äúfind‚Äù button is not pressed on bsn, I‚Äôm not going to view a separate one (except through the checkbox and ‚Äúselected details‚Äù), and bn.ru, despite the fact that all one table, different types of search on different types, and, for example, on ads with photos, there is no filter by area.  Not to mention the fact that you can sort by descending availability of the phone (is that anyway ??) but not by the date of placement (i.e. we cannot select ads for the last 3 days). <br><br>  But that's what I undertook to help my parents.  Write parsers, add data as you want, track the dates of addition, draw everything on the map at once - a trifling matter.  For example, as in <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/148782/">this article</a> .  If there is data. <br><br>  Indeed, in essence, the <b>site is a webmord to the database</b> .  The main thing is information, quality and quantity.  In my opinion, the first thing every site should strive for is to improve its base.  Make new filters, strive to get more content, connect external systems, create all new statistical samples and not just the ‚Äúaverage price chart‚Äù. <br><br>  And here is <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259B%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0">Lithuania</a> .  This is such a country, the population is half the size of St. Petersburg.  Has anyone heard of her?  There is a forest, poor people and cows, and there is no oil and no border with Europe.  It would seem, well, what kind of Internet can there be? <br><br>  We take <a href="http://domo.plius.lt/">domo.plius.lt</a> (advertising :)).  <a href="http://domo.plius.lt/paieska/butai">The search form is</a> normal, i.e.  There are <b>all the</b> parameters that on the Russian sites + classification by streets and utility data (the type of heating in Lithuania is important).  Select an ad from the new ones, for example <a href="http://domo.plius.lt/ru/skelbimai/parduodamas-3-kambariu-butas-vilniuje-pilaiteje-bitenu-g-1843284.html">this one</a> (first available, not advertising).  It has medium text and not a lot of photos, no video.  (Here is <a href="http://domo.plius.lt/ru/skelbimai/parduodamas-3-kambariu-butas-klaipedoje-senamiestyje-lietuvininku-a-1433165.html">another example</a> , where more text is video).  It is evident that people work - the owner is the text, the agent edits the video, because they <b>want to sell the</b> apartment.  The administration also does not sit - check out the new chip kurgyvenu (link Naudinga informacija in the menu and the block under the map).  Here you can find data: statistics on heating prices from Vilniaus energia, information on air cleanliness and noise, communications, house data from the housing cadastre, data from the police department on crime statistics on nearby streets, transport accessibility rating, shops / hospitals / education, and Schools - immediately with ratings, compiled on the basis of the ex.  This is all for this particular ad.  A text page and 15 photos are the norm. <br><br>  Now we go to bn.ru.  <a href="http://www.bn.ru/detail/flats/70371.html">Announcement</a> (not advertising).  Price, address, area, telephone + text - <b>137184 XSoknaLight / yard</b> .  It's all.  Yes, you cho, fucked?  Is it a bucks for a letter to save me a place on the monitor, so that I can sit here decrypt? <br><br>  It's sad. <br><br>  Immediately drawn excuses.  They say we can not, the text is announced is taken from the newspaper, realtors close the info, but the police do not provide data for statistics, but there is simply no air data.  And so on.  But for every problem you can come up with a solution if you want.  The text for the newspaper text is obligatory for the site, abbreviations are indicated by checkboxes with decoding.  No pictures?  Take at least from <a href="http://www.google.com/streetview">google street view</a> , these guys all Peter zafotkali. <br><br>  From the side it is clearly seen that this system in Russia is degenerating, and experts are increasingly sitting on the oil needle of freebies - they are not interested in anything and do not like their job.  Programmers who do not want to go into their own govnod, managers who are only interested in the number on the counter top.mail.ru, realtors who sleep and think only about how else to restrict access to information so that the occasional buyer with a direct deal does not slip past their commission.  After all, they also compose texts from <b>137184 HS-Window / courtyard</b> and <b>135256 PPD / H, ok-ul.</b>  <b>at.</b>  , and this is hard work. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/154351/">https://habr.com/ru/post/154351/</a></p>
