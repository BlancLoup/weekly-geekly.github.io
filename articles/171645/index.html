  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Web begging or sales experience in a web studio</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In our studio - no sales.  More specifically, there are no sales people who call customers and make ‚Äúcold‚Äù contacts.  There are only those who correctly handle incoming requests.  The time interval between departure from the first and coming to the second was quite large.  The studio for a very long time believed that sales were such walkers, beggars, and we do not need this at all.  Now I understand - what exactly we were wrong then. <br><br>  Write this article inspired me a bright flashback from the past.  2008, I am 18 and I climb with a heavy laptop in my bag along the stairs to the 5th floor of an office building.  I work in one of the major web studios of our millionth city and I have a meeting with the director of a recruitment agency.  I have to present our studio and sell the creation of the site for 30-40, and if I'm lucky and for 50 000 p.  The agency's contacts were transferred to me by a girl who recently made a deal with him in the directory of companies advertising, said that there is money - maybe the site will order.  I know that, most likely, the customer will be "rotten", but I still go, because this is my job, and probably still hope for success.  The director of the agency, in fact, turns out to be an aunt about 40 years old, who doesn‚Äôt care that she has no website.  She bought cheap furniture, rented 2 rooms with a total complexity of 30 meters in an ordinary office building and still does not know that her business will not be in six months.  A miracle did not happen and the site I did not sell ... <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Behind this flashback another reached out - all the same 18, I'm going by taxi to the industrial zone.  And I pay a taxi from my pocket.  In the industrial zone there are other customers - they are engaged in some kind of filters for water purification, build houses and extract oil.  The contacts were transferred by the same girl from the catalog of enterprises, describing the customer as very, very solvent.  At the place I meet 2 middle-aged men, one of whom is the manager, the second is his subordinate.  The manager is able to talk exclusively with a mat, inserting it correctly in Pelevinsky, and it is precisely from this that he immediately begins to feel sick.  The subordinate just doesn‚Äôt care - he will still do what his boss says obscenities.  That transaction was completed successfully and the web studio made 2 sites for that office.

      These 2 meetings were remembered because they were the first and last for me from a series of a dozen others.  I am not a sales person, just in that web-studio the manager was sure that the projectors could be used as cheap selling labor.  Now, when I myself head a large web studio of the same city - I think somewhat differently. <br><br>  When we first opened the studio, we didn‚Äôt escape the web sales experience through cold calls.  There was little money to advertise, customers still did not know that a new studio had appeared, and those that knew were afraid to trust, add to this a small portfolio and the decision to hire sales will come by itself. <br><br>  But, remembering the experience of past work, we immediately made the first important conclusion.  Naturally, it is necessary to separate sales and projects.  You can not sit on two chairs, as they tried to do in the previous studio - you still can not catch anyone.  In short - sales talkative, charismatic, energetic and arrogant manipulator.  The project is thoughtful, prudent, but also not devoid of charisma and charm.  Actually, different people.  If for sales it is not difficult to pick up the phone and sit on the ears of the client, then for the project, it may be difficult. <br><br>  And we hired a very high-quality salesman, who worked for 2 months.  Having made, at the same time, exactly one sale.  Starting to analyze, we saw that the salesman worked really well - we sat in the same room and heard how the work was going on - but there was no sales and this is a fact. <br><br>  Therefore, our next conclusion from the experience of cold calls was an understanding of the price niche of successful sales of websites.  These are cheap-quick fixes.  If you remember the first flashback, the aunt clearly does not spend 50,000 r on a corporate site if she has only 300,000 r and she does not intend to conduct the bulk of her business via the Internet.  And large companies, for the most part, already have a website and, like in the second flashback, they are usually responsible for employees who don‚Äôt care how modern and usable this resource is. <br><br>  Actually, having made some simple logical connections, you can see that the aunt would buy the site, say, no more than 15,000 rubles - 25,000 rubles, and only because her friend also has a website, and the ol-lo-worker would quickly sign with her the chief account for the same, or a slightly larger amount, because it is painless for their mega-corporations and no one will pay attention to it.  Plus, you need a quick solution - a week, the highest maximum is a month.  After all, a small business can go broke while it still makes the site, and the turnover in the marketing department of large companies is very large. <br><br>  It is necessary to morally prepare for a more expensive site and do it for quite a long time.  It is necessary to ripen at all for the decision to make a site.  See what kind of web studios are in the city and what they offer, call them, examine the prices and terms, and then choose the best solution for themselves.  Do it yourself or instruct the employee who will be responsible for it.  And it is at this stage that studios working in the price range adequate to their city need to make a competent presentation, tell about the services and benefits, hook the client. <br><br>  Some time ago we didn‚Äôt have a sales person who would work with clients specifically at this stage.  The project manager, free from business, simply picked up the phone and told the potential customer about prices and the beautiful design that our studio makes.  Someone spoke well, someone did not really, they paid little attention to it - because there were always orders and there were a lot of them.  Until the project came, which used to work in sales.  He could sell anything to anyone, anywhere.  Almost every second or third call to the studio became a valid client.  Project sales was so good that it was even used by the seo department. <br><br>  And here we empirically understood - why do we need sales?  The myth of the uselessness of web begging has been destroyed.  We realized that sales in a web-studio are necessary, but it is important to separate flies from cutlets - they are useful only at the stage when the client made a conscious decision to make a website, he is ready to pay an adequate amount for it, he presents the real terms of the project, but to him it's hard to figure out what does one studio differ from another.  It is at this moment that the talkative and charismatic sales will come to the aid of the client and your studio.  The client will receive the desired product, studio order, and sales salary.  And no outstretched hand. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/171645/">https://habr.com/ru/post/171645/</a></p>
