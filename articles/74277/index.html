  <section class="page js-page"><h1>re: sad statistics</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I was inspired by today's post <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/blog_sersh/74232/">‚ÄúSad statistics or never rely on freelancers‚Äù to</a> write this post.  In fact, it will be an anti-post to him. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  On the one hand, a post, like a post, is a statement of a subjective opinion on a problem, but on the other hand, everything is one-sided and not entirely logical. <br>  This post personally caused extreme hostility and disgust in me, as well as a lack of understanding. <br>  Firstly, I myself a flasher, and although I sit in the office, sometimes I am engaged in freelancing.  Secondly, not so long ago I had the opportunity to work remotely with Anton on the same team, so to some extent I took his post to my side.  (If, for the curious, the work experience is neutral, they worked, they passed and it is good) Thirdly, and most of all, the mad popularity of the post (at the time of this writing is +195) indicates that people understand little in the work of a freelancer, or In general, uneducated anikees, or maybe just bastards (I think for this phrase I will otgreb so much karma that I can never write here :)) <br><br>  My post will consist of two parts: the first is the answer to Anton's post, the second is my comments on the situation with freelancers and customers as such. <br><br>  So.  Personally, I would be ashamed to post such a post.  From the first lines, I got the impression that they were trying to impose someone else‚Äôs, unfit thought for me.  " <i>Attention! This article contains ...</i> ".  it is straight like "Everyone got air in their lungs, now it will be funny" (c).  Second, it put me in a light stupor.  Post that with freelancers should not work, although the author himself a freelancer with experience.  Further, in fact, a boring text begins, on the subject I am the same D'artanyan.  The author had a clear statement of work, terms and three flashers, which for various reasons did not cope and fell off.  This encouraged him to revise his previous works, which led to an even more sad conclusion.  Of the people who worked with him, only 5 percent did not drop it.  Say sad all?  And I will say that he himself is to blame.  Once an accident, twice a coincidence, three times the law.  If there are always flaws, then you should probably reconsider your requirements for the performer and the method of his choice, and not hang a medal on his chest, for the fact that everything works like hell.  And in general, more understanding of the problems of other people. <br>  What do I mean by more understanding? <br>  <i>‚Äú18 of them (35%) abandoned the project at an early or late stage.</i>  <i>Those.</i>  <i>someone suddenly had a business, someone gets married, falls ill, becomes uninteresting to someone ... Well, kindergarten, really.</i>  <i>Of these, 12 people (67%) returned an advance, while the remaining 6 disappeared, someone immediately after receiving the money, someone pre-powdered their brains. ‚Äù</i> <br>  A performer is not a slave who volunteered to plow from dusk to dawn for food, he also has his own rights besides duties.  If the disease and the wedding is a child garden, then I recommend reading the Labor Code for the beginning.  And to record 12 people who returned an advance, especially at an early stage, into the barren is disgusting. <br>  Still need to be treated with respect to the labor and experience of others, so that later there was no <br>  <i>Or the copywriter refused to break in half a paragraph of a huge text, because ‚Äúhe knows better, but it‚Äôs not written in the statement of work‚Äù.</i> I want to remind you that the copywriter was hired so that he could do what he knew best. <br>  And in order for the project to succeed, it is necessary to make the correct TZ, which is rare in itself, but after its preparation, the project can be considered half completed. <br>  At the same time, it will eliminate the side effects in the form <br>  <i>For example, the flasher flatly refused to put a simple link inside the movie to the button already there, because it was not described in the statement of work.</i> <br>  And rightly so, it was necessary to think up such things initially in the TK.  And in order to insert a banal link on a button, I need to find the file that needs to be fixed, find the line, insert, recompile, send to the customer and wait for confirmation that everything is gut.  (usually 20-30 minutes, depending on the efficiency of customers), and at this time I can do the project for money or have a rest for my pleasure. <br>  (update from comments: once or twice you can and even need to make such trifles, but not more)

      "But the biggest trouble in the freelancing world is timing."  I subscribe to each letter.  and the Author will also sign under each letter, if I remind you;) <br><br>  I think my negative reaction is now clear.  and how for me this kind of article is a demonstration of non-professionalism <br><br>  Now at the end of the promised second part.  She will be small. <br>  What the customer needs to understand <br>  1) The freelancer is the same person, no better and no worse than the customer, with his problems and other cockroaches. <br>  1) Hypoliter is hired to do his job with quality and according to TK.  If it is done not according to the TZ, all the trump cards are in the hands of the customer, and if according to the TZ, then please, do not need it - ‚ÄúAnd let's move the logo 2 pixels to the right‚Äù. <br>  1) Timing, multiply by 1.5.  EVERYTHING.  and managers and performers.  And not because then you need to find other executives in return for the current one, if you immediately approach the project better, don‚Äôt take it at all, but because in the process of work there will be a lot of serious and not very reasons for delaying the work <br>  1) Portfolio. <br>  - If a person in the portfolio has a bunch of pictures without links, these are crafts or fakes.  For each work in the portfolio should be a link to either the product itself or to the description of where it is used. <br>  - reviews, with them you have more chances to run into non-pro.  (it concerns RuNet more).  If you really need these reviews, then check the complexity of the project for which the review was left.  better look at the portfolio <br>  1) Clear TK and make sure that the performer understands it as you do. <br>  1) Don't be greedy for money <br>  1) Bug trackers, and not only for bugs :) <br><br>  update (from comments) <br>  1) Codetrackers </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/74277/">https://habr.com/ru/post/74277/</a></p>
