      [pathetic mode on] <br>  Aviators have such a saying - the weather must be waited at the aerodrome.  If we change it a bit, then we can say: <b>Aviation should be loved - when flying.</b> <br>  [/ pathetic mode off] <br><br>  I will talk about aircraft with a maximum take-off weight of up to 600 kg, otherwise this topic will become endless.  The article will use the abbreviation <b>LA</b> , which means an <b>aircraft</b> . <br><br>  Any motor LA is just a <b>glider with an engine</b> .  If the engine fails in the air, you turn into a pilot of a bad glider.  And your chances of salvation are equal to your skills. <br><br>  In the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/167093/">last article</a> there were many questions regarding flight safety as such. <br>  Now I will try to pay more attention to the risks of flight. <br><br>  <i>Nobody was in the air yet.</i>  <i>All return to earth.</i>  <i>(c) folk wisdom</i> <br><br><h5>  What can happen in flight (ordered by decreasing probability): </h5><br><ul><li>  <b>Engine failure</b> <br>  It may take you by surprise if you are not ready for it.  If you train - it's not scary.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DFEQ8ANx9VpQ">A nasty example.</a>  Mythbusters even <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DaHDWtrXwHNY">checked</a> . <br></li><li>  <b>Pilot error during takeoff or landing</b> <br>  Usually means an insufficient level of training or reassessment of their strength.  Regular exercise will minimize the likelihood of such an event. <br></li><li>  <b>Difficult meteorological conditions</b> <br>  The weather does not change instantly.  20 minutes ahead it is quite possible to predict visually, assessing the dynamics of development.  And the presence of the motor allows you to fly around in bad weather or go back. <br></li><li>  <b>Violation of aircraft limitations</b> <br>  Most aircraft have limit operation parameters.  If you do not know them or do not know how to observe them, then it is still too early for you to fly without an instructor. <br></li><li>  <b>Collision with ground obstacles</b> <br>  Most often cut into the wires, because  they are not noticeable.  I know quite a few of such cases.  Many are fatal.  However, all instructions prohibit flying over obstacles below 50m.  If you fly around the terrain - you yourself have created a threat to yourself.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D6gWGrUXrDws">There are bad airfields.</a> <br></li><li>  <b>Colliding with another LA</b> <br>  Most flights take place according to the rules of " <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D1%2583%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D1%2585_%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D1%2591%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2">visual flight</a> ."  This means that you must turn your head 360 degrees to prevent this.  The collision is most likely in places where LA is congested.  Do not meddle in the crowd. <br></li><li>  <b>Loss of orientation and, as a result, landing outside the airfield</b> <br>  The most common problem for beginners.  From the air, the earth does not look at all like on the map.  Even with a map in hand, you can get lost.  Now GPS saves from this problem, if it refuses - there can be many problems.  I fly with two GPS receivers with independent power sources. <br></li><li>  <b>Collision with a bird</b> <br>  Yes, sometimes.  The consequences of such a collision are similar to a collision with a bird in a car.  But the probability is similar. <br></li><li>  <b>Impairment of well-being</b> <br>  If before the flight you have health problems - do not fly.  A sudden deterioration of well-being is a rather rare situation. <br></li></ul><br><br><h5>  Important features of motor flight </h5><br><ul><li>  The smaller the aircraft, the more susceptible it is to air flow (there is more sausage in flight), but the more freedom of movement it is. <br></li><li>  The presence of the engine requires <b>attention to the performance of</b> its work and compliance with service regulations.  To score on a strange sound is risky.  For example, overheating is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DyDu0jYiz-v8">very dangerous</a> . <br></li><li>  The presence of the engine is <b>relaxing</b> .  There is an illusion that at any time you can give gas and fly away from danger.  This is usually the case, but if at this moment the engine fails, you can <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DKgpddw6AVYY">break the</a> wood. <br></li><li>  Takeoff has a number of features: <br><br><ol><li>  If the engine is located in the nose (pulling screw), then a gyroscopic moment is created, which tends to turn the plane in the direction of rotation of the propeller.  It is necessary to compensate for the rudder. <br></li><li>  If the engine is located behind (the pushing screw), then you will turn in the opposite direction.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DmOK_u1ZIUyU">There are fakapy</a> . <br></li></ol><br></li><li>  Usually there are several fuel tanks.  They are switched by an ordinary mechanical valve.  You can incorrectly switch the valve and even in the presence of fuel to get engine failure in the air. <br></li><li>  LA can be sold in two forms: as a finished product and as a KIT-set (aircraft designer ‚ÄúLego‚Äù).  KIT-kit is cheaper and you can (in theory) assemble yourself, which allows for customization. <br></li><li>  Technically, it is possible to fly in any weather.  Flying in the rain and snow creates additional risks, but the pilot is free to make a decision about the flight. <br></li><li>  In Europe, the level of development of private aviation is at least 10 times higher than in the CIS.  For example, in England 112 flight schools, and in Ukraine - 3. <br></li><li>  Big aircraft flies on special, aviation, engines.  For small aircraft often used engines from lawn mowers, motorcycles, snowmobiles and cars.  Their reliability depends on the qualifications of the staff.  Aircraft engines are more expensive. <br></li><li>  Many engines run on an ordinary A-95. <br></li><li>  In motor aircrafts, they often use not an individual rescue device (parachute), but the rescue system of the entire aircraft (large parachute). <br></li><li>  Most training programs consist of theory and at least 40-45 flight hours. <br></li></ul><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">What kind of people shouldn't fly</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><ul><li>  <b>With increased emotionality.</b> <br>  Do not cope with emotions in the air - to be in trouble. <br></li><li>  <b>Overconfident.</b> <br>  The level of your training is estimated by more experienced pilots.  And your opinion may not coincide with their opinion.  You must be able to humble yourself. <br></li><li>  <b>Lovers to break the law and swim against the stream.</b> <br>  It is one thing to violate state laws, and quite another - the laws of aerodynamics. <br></li><li>  <b>Extreme</b> <br>  All aviation is built on flight safety.  If you are looking for extreme here, you will easily find it.  Only I do not want to fly with you. <br></li><li>  <b>Lazy or unwilling to learn</b> <br>  You can take off and land, possessing only mechanical management skills.  The lack of knowledge of the theory in a strange way attracts problems. <br></li></ul><br></div></div><br><h4>  Aircraft </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5b9/c1c/89d/5b9c1c89d702febe804a9dfa7bdf0040.jpg"><br><br>  With these aircraft began aviation.  The plane of the Wright brothers just falls into this category.  In essence, this is an air car.  You can fly over the houses or gain a kilometer of height and look down on the ground.  Full freedom of action!  Flying on a small plane is not at all like flying a passenger on a large one. <br><br><h5>  Data: </h5><br><ul><li>  Empty weight from 80kg to 300kg. <br></li><li>  Speed ‚Äã‚Äãfrom 50km / h to 220km / h. <br></li><li>  Price new from $ 40,000. <br></li><li>  Take off from water, snow or soil.  Takeoff distance of about 150m.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Ffeature%3Dplayer_detailpage%26amp%3Bv%3DEOGTjUoU22c">It is possible less</a> . <br></li><li>  For planting is usually enough 300m.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DhcMOBPIWKm8">Masters enough and 20m.</a> <br></li><li>  A parachute for the entire aircraft is used as a rescue system.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Ffeature%3Dplayer_detailpage%26amp%3Bv%3DaG4nIeyaoek">Really saves</a> . <br></li><li>  Gasoline consumption A-95 about 9l / 100km * (in the absence of wind). <br>  For distances within the fuel reserve, the flight by plane can be cheaper than by car, since  the flight takes place in a straight line and with the same automobile consumption. <br></li></ul><br>  * - Aviation does not measure fuel consumption per 100 km.  Everything is measured in engine hours at different power.  The figure given is the average value. <br><br><h5>  pros </h5><br><ul><li>  This is really a plane.  Took and flew where you want.  Weather dependence is minimal.  You can fly <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DAw4FulU3rao">above the clouds</a> . <br></li><li>  The design of serial aircraft worked out, a lot of information on the Internet.  You can do something from scratch. <br></li><li>  Depending on the engine, aircraft can reach up to 6000m.  Above 4000m a person needs oxygen equipment. <br></li><li>  The plane itself can steer on the ground.  This is very convenient, but you should always take into account the presence of wings, because  they are easy to hook on something. <br></li><li>  With proper preparation, you can travel across continents and even <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DrDokAWe5mlg">between them</a> . <br></li><li>  You can buy a KIT-kit (designer) and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DvJJGVHVB4Gk">build it</a> yourself. <br></li><li>  Some are perfectly able to turn <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DKI5wBvP4p2I">aerobatics</a> .  And even <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Dm7uwmuQT9zo">such</a> . <br></li></ul><br><h5>  Minuses </h5><br><ul><li>  This is a full-fledged aircraft, which means that it requires documents (which must be regularly renewed) and a pilot certificate. <br></li><li>  Although the aircraft can technically fly up to 6000m, in practice in the CIS it is possible to fly only up to 900-1500m.  Above - you need to agree.  Legislation is different in different countries. <br></li><li>  When flying along a route, you are required to have a working radio communication and conduct radio communication with controllers, which requires specific skills. <br></li></ul><br>  <b>Medical requirements</b> <br>  In Europe, even an invalid can fly a plane, but in the CIS it is required to undergo a real medical examination. <br>  But there is a saying: a medical commission does not pass only the greedy or the dead.  So this is not an insurmountable problem.  The situation is slowly improving, and European norms come into our world. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/REmmQMDW8Vg%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256&amp;usg=ALkJrhjnoBE-5DjyhqNdg263xRI_HDnpnQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h4>  Motorized glider (deltalet) </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/eae/64a/29c/eae64a29caa07b4c5cfc7fbb43c9c88f.jpg"><br><br>  This is exactly the thing on which <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DapHpVUTEiqQ">Putin</a> had the honor <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DapHpVUTEiqQ">to fly</a> . <br>  If we draw the analogy of an airplane = a car, then a hang glider = a motorcycle. <br>  There is a completely new trend nanoTrike - almost a stool with a motor <br>  Continuing the analogy, this is an air moped. <br><br><h5>  Data: </h5><br><ul><li>  It consists of two parts: a hang-glider (wing) and a trolley with a motor.  Some hang gliders are so versatile that they can be used for both motor and soaring flights. <br></li><li>  Instead of wheels, floats for take-off from the water or skis for snow can be installed. <br></li><li>  It is often used for aviation work. <br></li><li>  As a rule, the cabin is open. <br></li><li>  Empty weight from 100kg to 300kg. <br></li><li>  Speed ‚Äã‚Äãfrom 50km / h to 150km / h <br></li><li>  There are 1,2 and 3 local. <br></li><li>  Price of the new from $ 20,000 to $ 100,000 <br></li></ul><br><br><h5>  Pros: </h5><br><ul><li>  It is quite versatile and compact for storage. <br></li><li>  This is almost a full transport. <br></li><li>  More intuitive to control than an airplane, because  close to the bike. <br></li><li>  The feeling of flight is brighter, because  no cabin. <br></li><li>  From it you can <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DrJdwFdJ0thU">jump with a parachute</a> . <br></li><li>  There are special flight schools where you can learn how to fly using specially designed programs. <br></li><li>  All components are easily accessible for maintenance and repair. <br></li><li>  Maybe he steer on the ground. <br></li></ul><br><br><h5>  Minuses: </h5><br><ul><li>  ‚ÄúWind in the hare, and I scrub‚Äù - this is about the trike.  It is not very comfortable to fly without a closed helmet, especially in the winter.  And with it visibility and impressions are sharply reduced.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DapnZN93HcEE">There are perverts</a> . <br></li><li>  The flight is not as comfortable as on the plane. <br></li><li>  It is necessary to fly in overalls, because  even if it is hot on earth, it will be cold from the oncoming flow, and the higher - the colder it will be.  And on the ground in overalls hot. <br></li><li>  Inverse control.  For many pilots, this is not very convenient, because  back to the aircraft. <br></li><li>  More affected by air flow.  A strong gust of wind or upward flow can knock the control stick out of your hands. <br></li><li>  You need to put physical effort to fly in a straight line. <br></li><li>  In the case of landing / falling on the forest, nothing protects you.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DWFL1i0Jx2rM">An example</a> . <br></li></ul><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/KeMchtBedx4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256&amp;usg=ALkJrhg8_eceARdo2ExYKCZpltZkvTg62g" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">One more photo</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><h5>  nanoTrike in flight </h5><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1cf/80d/64f/1cf80d64fc36adae9feca39642f19f1d.jpg"><br><br><h5>  nanoTrike on earth </h5><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2db/4fd/aad/2db4fdaad24dc090db824565e4a2a374.jpg"><br></div></div><br><br><h4>  Paramotor (motorcycle) </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/127/bd4/896/127bd489651b97376faff98be1e55d76.jpg"><br><br>  This is a realization of the idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãCarlson.  To put the engine on your back and, using a paraglider, to fly.  Excellent hobby weekend. <br><br><h5>  Data </h5><br><ul><li>  Engine weight from 7kg to 20kg. <br></li><li>  Flight speed from 20km / h to 60km / h <br></li><li>  In quality of transport practically are not used. <br></li><li>  Usually single.

Nobody will fix the mistakes for you. <br></li><li>  Pilot training techniques do not exist.  Train current pilots in their individual programs. <br></li><li>  If the engine fails in the air - you do not have either aerodynamic quality or speed reserve.

It can fly from point A to B. <br></li><li>  A motorized hang glider is a motorcycle or moped. <br></li><li>  Paratrayk is a fan.  Long haul flights are rare. <br></li><li>  A paramotor is an opportunity to feel like a <s>carlson and fly to the baby</s> in the sky as cheaply as possible. <br></li><li>  The motoplaner is flying on a glider without a tugboat and with insurance. <br></li></ul><br>  The number of myths and stereotypes about aviation is extremely large.  Some of them were attempted to dispel.  And in conclusion one more moment. <br><br>  If you think that flying is a pleasure for the rich, then you are mistaken. <br>  There are options even for those whose income is not allowed to fly on a commercial basis. <br><br>  Regardless of the situation with finances, the first thing to do is to <b>COME AT THE AERODROME</b> .  Make an introductory flight (of course, for a fee).  In the process, you will not only understand how interesting this is for you, but also gain the first aviation acquaintances.  The best option would be to try not only a plane, but also a glider - these are two different worlds and concepts. <br><br>  Returning to the option when there is no money: you can fly (including study), if you perform some work at the airfield.  Work is often unqualified (to dig or build something), but you want to fly, right?  Vacancies and announcements of this are not posted at the entrance to the airfield, but you can learn about them in private conversation.  That's what you need and familiar at the airport. <br><br>  Another point of application of your strength, as well as a way of exploring the world of aviation, is volunteering by profession.  In quality, developers, designers, artists, administrators of OS, electronics engineers and so on. <br>  Aerodromes, aviation training centers, federations of aviation sports, as well as other "earthly" structures, require websites, graphics and other IT assistance.  Also, the help of teams of aviarestavtory, among which there are teams raising to the sky historical vehicles. <br><br>  If there is a desire, but to whom it is not clear to help, contact <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/leksey/" class="user_link">leksey</a> Alexey Spiridonov (leksey@ya.ru) in Russia and <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/genius_a/" class="user_link">genius_a</a> Anton Voronin in Ukraine. <br><br>  Tell your friend / girlfriend about this offer.  Our experience shows that there are enough volunteers to contribute in this area, but most of them have no points of intersection with the aviation world. <br>  A remarque for those who think that this is such an attempt to attract free labor: aviation in Russia and Ukraine in most cases is an occupation for devotees and fans, where, like at the dawn of flying, everything rests on enthusiasts.  However, in the main aviation country - America, much is similar. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/176205/">https://habr.com/ru/post/176205/</a></p>
