  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Overview of Ubiquam UM-400 CDMA Modem</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Every summer in the summer I, like many others, go out of town.  While preparing for the next departure, I thought it would be nice to have high-speed wireless Internet in the village to spend time there comfortably on rainy evenings.  My choice fell on the operator SkyLink and its tariff "Country Internet".  The price is 1 ruble for 1 megabyte in a dedicated area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe MO (the village where I go, it enters) is attractive, isn't it?  Before that, I already had a Ubiquam U-300 phone, but in order to stay connected to the previous number and not suffer with overload of RUIMok, I bought a Ubiquam UM-400 modem. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I wasn‚Äôt allowed finances to buy a modem at that time, and I bought it with a used radio at the nearest radio market, so I can‚Äôt say anything about the bundling.  But judging by the description on the SkyLink site, except for the modem itself and the driver disk in the bundle there should be nothing.  Therefore, when I bought it with poyuzanny, I did not lose much, except a guarantee. <br><br>  The assembled modem looks like this: <br><br><img src="http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/1337658/skyobzor/photos/P1000599.JPG">

        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      Disassembled like this: <br><br><img src="http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/1337658/skyobzor/photos/P1000605.JPG"><br><br><img src="http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/1337658/skyobzor/photos/P1000606.JPG"><br><br>  On the left side of the modem is a connector under the headset, which when connected, it is theoretically possible to call.  But in the Russian party of modems such function is not incorporated, therefore this connector is useless for us. <br><br><img src="http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/1337658/skyobzor/photos/P1000612.JPG"><br><br>  On the right side there is a port for connecting an external antenna, which you will most likely need (more on this later). <br><br><img src="http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/1337658/skyobzor/photos/P1000611.JPG"><br><br>  In operation, the modem looks like this: <br><br><img src="http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/1337658/skyobzor/photos/P1000610.JPG"><br><br>  The left light simultaneously performs the role of both the power indicator and the activity indicator (it is blinking with active data transfer).  The second light on the left shows which network is currently available: 1X (red, up to 153 kbps) or Ev-DO rev.0 (blue, up to 2400 kbps).  Ev-DO rev.A This modem does not support.  The remaining lights show the signal level. <br><br>  Now consider the software that comes with the modem.  Along with the drivers, the program ‚ÄúAccess Manager‚Äù is installed, with the help of which the modem and the connection are controlled. <br>  When you start the program, we see this window: <br><br><img src="http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/1337658/skyobzor/screens/1.png"><br><br>  In it you can see the current time (why?), Establish a connection and configure a modem.  Consider the settings. <br><br><img src="http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/1337658/skyobzor/screens/2.png"><br><br><img src="http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/1337658/skyobzor/screens/3.png"><br><br><img src="http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/1337658/skyobzor/screens/4.png"><br><br>  As we can see, in the settings you can enable or disable the PIN-request for a RUIM card, set up a data transfer account and select the connection mode (1X, Ev-DO or mixed).  The variety is small, but we have enough :) <br><br>  Now press the ‚ÄúConnect‚Äù button and see what the program will look like now. <br><br><img src="http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/1337658/skyobzor/screens/5.png"><br><br>  The clock changed to the connection time counter, the indicators of the current flow appeared.  You can open more detailed statistics and look at the chart. <br><br><img src="http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/1337658/skyobzor/screens/6.png"><br><br>  The review of the device itself and the software is finished, so let's return to the beginning of the topic, that is, to the Internet in the country.  And with this, this modem is not very good.  When I tried to connect, nothing came of it.  The full receive signal indicator went out and began to show that there is no network.  But as soon as I stopped connecting, the indicator returned to the full signal position.  Phone Ubiquam U-300 caught in the same place a network of 1X perfect, Ev-DO is not very good.  I tried to go out with the laptop and the modem, but I still could not get out.  Then I tried to connect through the phone.  The connection was successful.  It does not fly, there are packet losses, but it works.  In the fight with this was made such a structure: <br><br><img src="http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/1337658/skyobzor/photos/P1000418.JPG"><br><br>  A telephone was placed in a white box under the roof (I tried the modem, I still didn‚Äôt have enough power) and the connection was established from home.  The speed from 150 kbps increased to 1500 kbps, the packet loss disappeared.  Profit, it would seem.  But with this decision, I was left without a telephone connection, since the mobile phone was used to connect to the network and hung under the roof.  A simpler solution was invented - to insert a large coil of copper wire into the antenna port of the modem.  Connect earned at a speed of about 700 kbps. <br><br>  But the test data transfer speed in Moscow, Ochakovo district <br><br><img src="http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/1337658/skyobzor/screens/7.png"><br><br>  Perhaps these are temporary glitches of the network, and maybe this is always the case, I have not tested it before.  Elsewhere in the city, the speed was around two megabits per second. <br><br>  So, the conclusion.  This modem is well suited to those who need high-speed Internet within the city.  In the Moscow region, using a modem will not work because of a rather poor reception (in my case, it was 5 kilometers to the base station, this is a normal distance for CDMA2000). <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> Carried out the speed test again.  The result was much better.  Apparently the day just lagged the network. <br><br><img src="http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/1337658/skyobzor/screens/8.png"><br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/67846/">https://habr.com/ru/post/67846/</a></p>
