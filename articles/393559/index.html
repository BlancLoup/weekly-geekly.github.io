  <section class="page js-page"><h1>"New" phone with Aliexpress with old sms</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Greetings to the community. <br><br>  An unpleasant situation happened (fortunately not for me).  On the one hand, I want to warn, on the other hand, it is possible to get advice - and what should I do? <br><br>  A friend called and asked for advice.  I bought a new phone in Aliexpress to my friend.  The phone came correctly.  Outwardly, everything is fine and the device itself is working.  But inside were contacts and SMS.  And as he knows several languages, but Russian is not included in them, he turned to me with a question.

      Alas, in fact, I have no experience in dealing with unscrupulous sellers on Aliexpress.  Until recently, I did not use it.  I could only ask how the payment was and whether the dispute with the seller is open.  Payment by Visa card, and the seller snaps that they want to dissolve him and in general he does not understand what they want from him.  The phone is there, it works, they stuffed something incomprehensible into it and fool your head. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  As I understood the situation - the phone in March was in Russia for a certain girl.  And then I ended up <a href="http://fantacy.aliexpress.com/store/609089">in China</a> .  And then my friend. <br><br>  Contacts <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/509/23a/36f/50923a36f3a1ce8632d5722fad80f039.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  SMS <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cad/f71/7cc/cadf717cc665140bbdca16b8f5da6f8e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The attempt to communicate with the "dad" is not particularly interesting.  Tolley got there not having understood the codes of operators, daddy toli decided that this is a divorce.  The conversation did not interest him. <br><br>  The phone is not in my hands, climb on the subject that there is still not work.  A friend in another city. <br><br>  As can be seen from the contacts and SMS - material for social engineering is there.  Names of friends, phones, SMS from the bank.  Most likely, if you climb in the memory, you can pull out the erased photos.  There will be something from the remnants of the application, if they were installed and managed to be used. <br><br>  The question remains, what to do with the seller? <br><br>  A friend would be advised to try to return the money.  But I strongly doubt that it will turn out judging by the negative reviews of other buyers.  I advise you to make a hard reset and use the device.  Iron seems to be no problem, but for some reason it was returned to the seller. <br><br>  ps.  The irony of the situation is that such a device in Israel costs exactly the price of Aliexpress + VAT that was taken at the post office.  It could be taken for the same money with a two-year warranty and without a headache.  But what's done is done. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/393559/">https://habr.com/ru/post/393559/</a></p>
