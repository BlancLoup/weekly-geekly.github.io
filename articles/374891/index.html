    <div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Brief history of beard and razor (in pictures)</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  It all started with a safety (bladed) razor.  There are still adherents of this method.  There are many subtleties in how to choose a razor, how to edit it and, of course, how to shave.  I think this needs a whole article, but not from me. <br> <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259E%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25B1%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/165/b4b/b7f/165b4bb7fd2e4a8ba1a804b08bec327e.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  In the 20th century, <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2596%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D1%2582,_%25D0%259A%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B3_%25D0%259A%25D1%258D%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BF">King Camp Gillett</a> invented the T-shaped machine.  Safe - because you couldn't kill yourself.  Such machines also still shave.  Like a razor, they allow you to achieve an incredible cleanliness on your face, but they also require skill and personal care. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e64/51d/7ac/e6451d7ac948aac10cff82dc666641a7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In the 70s, familiar and familiar plastic machines with <s>plastic blade</s> cartridges appeared.  Of course, they defeated dangerous and safety razors - inexpensive, easy to use, hard to cut, easy to change the blade. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/96c/ea0/1d2/96cea01d2219409cb52284ad82d549ee.jpg"><br><br>  But we are not talking about that.  Already in the first half of the 20th century, electric razors appeared! <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6e7/71b/7e8/6e771b7e85b6704c2801b084134187e9.jpg" alt="image"><br>  In the 1920s, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Schick">Jacob Schick</a> patented and released the first electric razor. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/143/532/b3e/143532b3e90aa7f17d16dbf03fa396f8.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>But this, of course, is not the first razor.</i> <br>  At this moment I will finish the super-brief historical excursion and move on to the present. <br></div></div><br>  When I began the selection of the razor, the first question that confronted me was what type of shaving mechanism do I need?  The choice of two applicants - the rotor and the grid. <br><br>  In general, we should immediately say that today there are three leaders in the production of razors in the world - Philips, Braun and Panasonic.  And Philips produces only rotary, and the Germans with the Japanese - only the grid.  No, of course, there are other firms, such as Remington (or Chinese), but I think that it is only the ‚Äúbig three‚Äù that should be considered seriously. <br><br>  According to various reviews and articles, I had an opinion about the difference of technologies for the consumer.  Rotary quieter, better shaves long hair, often more durable knives.  Grid shaves cleaner and more gentle on the skin. <br>  Most people think that when switching to electricity, it is worth trying the grid first, as it is more pleasant for the skin, and, according to the shaving technique, closer to the machine.  Looking ahead - so I did. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/98f/724/ad5/98f724ad504b3d0168d248e5a182f35d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In this case, a lot depends on the type of skin and hair, so it is impossible to predict what suits you exactly - a rotor or a mesh, Braun or Panasonic, and whether the shaver is suitable in general.  Few can give objective advice, since rarely anyone has a rotor, and a grid and enjoys both. <br><br>  <b>Rotary razors.</b> <br>  Most modern rotary shavers have three floating heads.  At the same time, <i>some people</i> release razors with five!  Under the round mesh is a knife that rotates and shaves hairs that have fallen into the holes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/077/6ef/2c9/0776ef2c99c9b3adebba056e8212ab16.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Of course, the manufacturer (in this section, he is actually equal to Philips) is trying to improve the quality of shaving, making particularly clever grids, knives and floating heads mechanisms, etc (registering patents and trademarks, hiring more and more marketers).  Perhaps I will only say about Lift &amp; Cut - this means that the knife has such a structure that it first draws a hair inward, and then cuts it closer to the skin. <br><br>  All set of razors can be divided into small groups according to the following features. <br><br>  1) For dry shaving or for wet. <br>  2) By series (the eldest - 9).  The number of improvements applied to the base system motor + knife + case depends on this.  At the same time in the middle razor you can find a top head for 1/5 of the price of a top razor, but you have to accept that it will be only for dry shaving, not such a futuristic body and more. <br>  3) The presence or absence of a glass for cleaning.  For recharging and cleaning razors, there are special glasses in which you need to pour a special liquid (or insert cartridges with it).  They (possibly) make life more comfortable, but do not affect the quality of shaving.  All manufacturers have such stations. <br><br>  On <a href="http://www.philips.ru/c-m-pe/face-shavers">the</a> Philips <a href="http://www.philips.ru/c-m-pe/face-shavers">website, it's</a> pretty easy to figure out what's what. <br>  By the way, I believe that the design of the 9 series is great. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/11e/83a/046/11e83a0466f044169d0f2526ac8f582d.png"><br>  As far as I know, the shaving technique requires a razor to drive in a circle, video instructions are easy to find on youtube. <br>  An interesting observation is that there are a lot of posts in various blogs about the new 9 series, sooo much like an advertising campaign (well, or it is really so good that everyone bought and tried). <br><br>  <b>Net razors</b> <br>  Net razors also have more than one net.  The modern minimum is two grids and a cross-border trimmer (a total of three), while the maximum for Panasonica is 5 grids.  The knife moves left and right under the net, cutting off hairs that have entered the holes.  The mesh is much thinner than the heads in rotary shavers, due to which shaving is cleaner. <br><br>  They also have some simple characteristic features for classification. <br><br>  1) Dry and wet shave.  At Panasonic, all (or almost all) razors can be used both on dry and with foam, while on Braun, most can be used for dry, and only a few - for wet. <br>  2) By series.  I will not consider the younger series.  Reviews of owners of older razors about them are unpleasant, and reviews of their owners are average.  Yes, and for a loved one is to take something that does not disappoint. <br><br>  Braun is simple: something is there, then 3 episodes, 5, 7 and 9 episodes.  In Russia, the 9 series is not.  The 3 series is not particularly praised, 5 and 7 have the same construction of grids and knives, different from 3. They use holes of different sizes and more ... Read the advertisement, in vain did the marketers do it (by the way, not very well: ‚Äúpower 10,000 microvibrations "is generally how)?  It is interesting that in all series only 3 grids are used.  There are also CoolTec series shavers, but they seem to use the third series shaving mechanism.  In each series there are versions with a glass and for wet shaving. <br><br>  Panasonic has more difficulty: something-there, then ES-RF31 (41 - with stand-charging), then ES-LF51 (71 - with a glass), and finally ES-LV65 (95 - with a glass).  There are other models - older or those that are not imported into this country.  But like ES-LV95 is the top in the whole world.  31/41 have 4 grids, a hard-floating head and a speed of 10'000 rpm.  51/71 come with the same grids, but the head itself is much more floating (there is a possibility of blocking) and the speed is higher - 14'000.  65/95 - already five grids.  All of them can shave in the wet, all have arched nets and some of the nets are ultrathin. <br><br>  They say that the sound of Panasonic is higher, but at the same time you hear the sound of cutting hair when shaving, which allows you to shave by ear.  I confirm, really so. <br><br>  It is recommended to start with either Braun 5 series or RF31.  In general, the difference in shaving if there is, then for everyone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a9e/e8a/8b2/a9ee8a8b2b454e1db3de825446005cb8.jpg"><br><br>  It is worth saying that, like almost any thing, all electric shavers have consumables - these are grids with knives.  Braun and Panasonic recommend changing the mesh and knives once every two years approximately.  This is necessary not only because the knives are blunt, but also because the mesh is rubbed off and can tear.  I don‚Äôt know about Philips, but there are also recommended deadlines for knives.  Unfortunately, the cost of consumables is quite high.  They also complain that it can be difficult to find a Panasonic. <br><br>  It is necessary to take into account the cost of cartridges or liquids for cleaning stations and recharging (glasses).  Yes, the razor in them is cleaned not just with boiled water, but with a rather expensive solution. <br><br>  In general, fans of each brand and system have their own themes for holivar (for example): <br>  1) Grid vs rotor (obviously). <br>  2) Braun vs Panasonic (Panasonic is so bad that it increases the quality by the number of grids; Braun will not make curved grids and a giant body, etc.). <br>  3) The Big Three vs China (why pay more, if in the Middle Kingdom you can buy an analogue cheaper?). <br><br>  Leaving behind general questions, let's move on to the razor that appeared in me.  And this is the Panasonic ES-RF31 (by <a href="https://market.yandex.ru/product/6480221%3Fhid%3D90570">Y.Market</a> ).  It cost me a little less than 4'000 ‚ÇΩ, now, too, can be found for the price.  If you choose between RF31 and RF41 - take 31 - save 1'000, and a stand for charging, I think, for the most part is useless. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">For fans of anboxing</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3bd/8fb/6b5/3bd8fb6b548142569c54a3dd8014d5ff.jpg"><br>  Cardboard box with a beveled edge on top.  Inside the manual, warranty, razor with a protective head on the head, a brush for cleaning, a bag for transportation and charging.  In older models you can find a jar of oil, which is recommended to lubricate the mesh and knives. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4ef/5f6/235/4ef5f623519244b990ead3cdc78ac969.jpg"><br></div></div><br><br>  This is a four-grid: two standard grids, between which there are an inter-net trimmer and an ultra-fine grid. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a98/4b9/9ba/a984b99ba2544ad6931ccb31e5f2ae33.jpg"><br>  Two knives are fixed on a razor, two knives are included in the mesh design (in Braun all knives are connected to the grid in one block).  The upper part of the head is removed, and after shaving you can easily shake out the bristles.  what I am doing.  If you shake out the sink (which is logical), then turn on the water - the stubble in the razor turns into very fine dust.  Every time I wash the head.  It could be every time, but I do not have a shelf where the razor could comfortably dry until the next time.  Before the first use, I would recommend to treat the mesh and knives with alcohol - after all, a subject of personal hygiene. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/251/d08/969/251d089697794b02971ebfcc629dd507.jpg"><br><br>  The handle is small, and at first the handle with its head seemed disproportionate.  The head can swing slightly left and right, the grids independently can be pressed inwards.  The handle is made of silver plastic with black corrugated inserts in the front and slightly soft touch behind.  Conveniently lies in the hand. <br><br>  The power button together with the power lock ring (for transport).  Below it is a three-segment charge indicator.  By the way, the charge lasted for 3-4 weeks of shaving once every two days (the manufacturer says about 65 minutes). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f14/b5c/47d/f14b5c47dc6746958133bd6205d824c8.jpg"><br><br>  Trimmer retractable and seemed to me not very comfortable.  Can whiskey trim perhaps. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6c1/410/85e/6c141085e6874c0a86998303c9632f75.jpg"><br><br>  My experience in switching to an electric shaver, I hide under the spoiler. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">I will describe in the form of a small diary.</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Before that, I shaved a well-known machine with 5 blades.  The result with him is predictable and good, especially since I shave against the growth of hair (I can‚Äôt imagine how else it can be?).  Minus - irritation on the chin, probably caused by micro-cuts. <br>  <b>1 attempt.</b> <br>  Shave a half-day bristle dry.  Mindful of the need to be careful, he left some minor flaws, but on the whole the razor was pleasantly surprised that the cleanliness of the shaved places is quite comparable with the machine (!).  Of course, I still got a slight irritation, which eliminated the cream after shaving. <br>  <b>2 attempt.</b> <br>  Daily bristles, wet shave.  The razor, of course, does not fit on wet skin, therefore, having smeared a thin layer of gel, I tried to achieve maximum cleanliness of shaving, for which I paid cuts below the corners of the mouth (not so much unpleasant as ugly) and irritation.  But it is of some other type than with a machine, I think, in the first case, the reason is that the razor still pulls the hair, and in the second - a violation of the integrity of the upper skin cover. <br>  <b>3 attempt</b> <br>  The half-day bristles are easily cleaned dry, and the irritation is removed by an after shave. <br>  <b>4 and further</b> <br>  Over time, the irritation subsided, and I stopped using any means.  Usually my face, I wipe it dry and shave after five minutes (washed before breakfast, shaved after).  Takes and a three-day stubble, although not from the first pass.  It is important to know the direction of hair growth, but this is easily determined.  It was cut only once (told above).  Not for nothing, and manufacturers, and users recommend to make an opinion about the razor, not earlier than two weeks of shaving.  The skin should get used to a new irritant. <br>  Shaving quality is not inferior to the machine.  More precisely, it is not inferior with a reservation - the bristles appear half a day faster, but you can put up with it and shave more often, all the more so in terms of time and labor costs no more. <br>  And the electric shaver, by simplifying the shaving process and adding technology to it, made it more pleasant, so now I shave more often, and my girlfriend is glad.  ;-) Yes, and smoothly shaved, you can go for an interview (if invited)! <br></div></div><br>  At the end of the conversation about razors, I want to say that you can not shave off the beard, but cut it.  For this there are trimmers (there is not too much choice).  And although they do not relate to the topic of the post, but I can not get past the <a href="http://www.philips.ru/c-p/BT9290_15/beardtrimmer-series-9000-waterproof-beard-trimmer-with-worlds-first-laser-guide">trimmer</a> WITH A LASER SIGHT! <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/85b/89d/862/85b89d8629c93e6d6726d32137807b0c.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Perhaps, only Bluetooth can do it better. <br><br>  I want to say thank you: <br>  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25AD%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0">Wikipedia</a> . <br>  <a href="http://forum.ixbt.com/topic.cgi%3Fid%3D47:11754">Forum</a> users <a href="http://forum.ixbt.com/topic.cgi%3Fid%3D47:11754">iXBT</a> . <br>  Reviews on <a href="http://www.ferra.ru/ru/byt/review/How-to-choose-shaver/">ferra.ru</a> and <a href="https://hi-tech.mail.ru/bytovaya/elektrobritvy-panasonic-braun-philips.html">hi-tech.mail.ru</a> , having their pros and cons. <br>  And also to the test on <a href="http://zoom.cnews.ru/publication/item/28660">zoom.cnews.ru</a> , which begins with a giant file, obvious to all users of electric razors: ‚ÄúI will say right away - in fact, I shave with a machine.
