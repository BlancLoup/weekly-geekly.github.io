Links to presentations. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sv/ji/ya/svjiyaigcuh9ostzxt8rfxvgimk.jpeg" width="800" height="600"><br><br><ul><li>  We liked <a href="https://downloads.ctfassets.net/2grufn031spf/31bpgPQ3kAQUmA8QKcwm6w/ef97445730165e216e59c12a76f56446/_______________________UI____________________.pdf">Vyng's profiling report</a> .  Arthur Badretdinov gave an overview of the tools that can be used to optimize data display and animation.  For example, Gfxinfo shows frame statistics, and the Hierarchy Viewer shows the hierarchy and display speed of screen components.  There were other tools.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe report is that you should always measure how much time it takes, and what is your hierarchy.  If you log everything, you can quickly find the error.  Once again about the benefits of optimizing UI. </li><li>  It was interesting to listen to the talk about how they did the application with voice control ( <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/2grufn031spf/kJbQLT0J7EQUyIw44K4eA/4a1a09fe6ebea0f48de1bcce1183058d/Martin_Mitrevski_Building_Voice_Responsive_Apps_on_iOS.pdf">Building voice responsive apps on iOS</a> ).  In addition to the interesting main topic, there was an interesting thought: no matter what problem you solve, you should always look a little wider.  For example, how to understand that it is the user who is talking to the application at the moment, and not a stranger?  In that situation it was difficult realizable.  Alternatively, request permission to the Motion Detector and use the additional library to determine what kind of person it is.  The library is guided by the user's habits (as he gets the phone out of his pocket, as he takes it off the table) and with a probability of 90 percent determines what kind of person it is.  This can be useful for enterprise solutions. </li><li>  Interested in a report on the optimization of working with data ‚Äú <a href="https://downloads.ctfassets.net/2grufn031spf/6r6ymKBvGgy0WwKA0mMYyy/2a3db3782e553836cec1d7021b3dac97/Konrad_Feiler_-_HowToFitAMillionStars.pdf">How to fit a million stars in an iPhone</a> ‚Äù.  The developer made an application with a database of stars and their display on the screen in augmented reality, faced with the problems of working with a lot of information and thought about optimization.  Even if you write on Swift, do not forget about what is happening ‚Äúunder the hood‚Äù, for example, <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2592%25D1%258B%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D1%2585">data alignment</a> .  As a result, having played around with the structures, having completed the transformations and some more tricks, he stung the average size of the structure 4 times.  Although some of the methods were already familiar, it was interesting and useful to listen. </li><li>  In the report by Andrey Breslav about Kotlin it was interesting to hear about borrowing from other languages.  Moreover, he himself heads the development of the Kotlin language.  Also flashed the news that it is possible to return the ternary operator.  Finally, many developers asked to add it. </li><li>  Report ‚Äú <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/2grufn031spf/5Nu0a8SJkQA24WsekmAe4a/993660e4b2a9b2fc210470515866ae83/Micha___Ka__uz__ny_-_Reverse_Engineering_Mobile_Apps.pdf">Reverse engineering mobile apps: how, why, and what now?</a>  ‚ÄùMade you think about security.  Everyone knows that Android applications are easily decompiled and even obfuscation does not save much, but it seems that few people think about iOS.  The speaker showed that it is easy to hack both Android and iOS apps, demonstrating this with a live example.  With enough effort, you can easily pull out the API-token code.  It is very important to consider this when developing applications where you need to work with user data. </li><li>  <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/2grufn031spf/4ceRC38gneAC2gS4qGKGsC/845a9cf351beaac8ea20d54519b81ec8/Nekliudov_Make_it_fast___Mobius.pdf">The assembly time report</a> is very relevant to us.  If the application is a single large monolith, then it is going to take a very long time, even if you change just one line of code.  The solution is to divide the code into modules.  With this approach, only modified modules will be rebuilt and directly dependent on them.  A parallel build will also be involved.  The speaker told how using this approach he managed to reduce the build time from 3.5 minutes to 30 seconds. </li><li>  It was very interesting to listen <a href="https://downloads.ctfassets.net/2grufn031spf/6zZde37gFGk088SaSMsIe6/31cf4f77d247c45cab073fa5ba631981/Trimonov_AR_in_YandexMaps.pdf">to the Yandex.Maps report</a> on the integration of augmented reality into their iOS application.  Dmitry Trimonov did not just retell the documentation, but described in great detail the process of working on the task, the difficulties encountered, the ways to solve them, and even gave a brief insight into the history of AR / VR / MR with educational program. </li></ul><br>  In general, the conference was very useful.  Through many reports, the thought of security was stretched: try to use HTTPS whenever possible, see where you get the libraries, store tokens and other personal data in a safe place.  And you will be happy (and your users).
