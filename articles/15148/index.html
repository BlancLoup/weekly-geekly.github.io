  <section class="page js-page"><h1>10 customer tricks to pay you less</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  During my work as a freelancer, I heard a lot of persuasion and so I decided to write them down in one place so that you would not fall for these ‚Äúfishing rods‚Äù. <br><br>  So: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <strong>1. "My programmer makes cheaper"</strong> <br><br>  The customer tells you - "my programmer will make it much cheaper, he is just now very busy with other projects." 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      Most likely, there is actually no programmer, just the customer wants to save on you, getting what he needs and paying as little as possible.  And if this ‚Äúmythical‚Äù programmer exists, then most likely he is not busy, and does not want to work with this ‚Äúgreedy‚Äù customer anymore - the goal of which is ‚Äúto pay less - get more‚Äù. <br><br>  <strong>2. ‚ÄúBesides you, I still received offers from N distributors - they are much cheaper‚Äù</strong> <br><br>  This begs the question - if they offer cheaper - why he (the customer) does not order from them.  The answer here is that the customer likes your portfolio more than the ones that were offered.  But he (the customer) is greedy or he doesn‚Äôt have enough money and therefore he wants exactly the same quality as yours, but at the price of those N offered. <br><br>  <strong>3. "Let us make this work cheaper, and then I will give you constantly work and for other money"</strong> <br><br>  These are all sweet promises.  In fact, if the client does not have the money now to pay you more, they will not appear further.  Most likely, the client wants to do the work cheaply, motivating you with ‚Äúfuture projects,‚Äù as a result you will do it better than usual, because you have been promised.  And the customer, having received the job, will simply disappear - and your ‚Äúfuture projects‚Äù cried. <br><br>  Offer customers to work on their price - and in the future offer a discount, as for wholesale orders. <br><br>  <strong>4. "I have an excellent plan how to make a profitable project - I will pay you when we implement it"</strong> <br><br>  If a person has a good plan, he will always find sponsors or people from his city who will do him a job, if he is so sure of the project‚Äôs profitability.  However, such people very often look for ‚Äúworkers‚Äù through the Internet - after all, this does not oblige anything - and if anything happens, you cannot prove anything. <br><br>  <strong>5. ‚ÄúOur budget is much smaller than what you ask for‚Äù</strong> <br><br>  This is another trick with the pressure of pity, calculated on the fact that you are a person who makes concessions.  Do not trust these words!  No matter who the customer is - the budget can always be increased (of course, provided that the price that you called and the one that the customer calls does not differ in order), in my experience there have been projects that have the declared price 3 times lower the one that came out of the work.  Although the customer has long argued that "there is no more money, stop-off." <br><br>  <strong>6. ‚ÄúI am a representative of company X‚Äù</strong> <br><br>  With such a statement, the customer tries to put you on his knees in front of him, so that you try to please him in every way, in order to replenish your portfolio with work for Company X.  Do not be in a hurry to trust the words - ask for a couple of minutes and ask the customer's full name - look on the Internet for the contacts of this company and call it.  If you confirm that such a person really works in this company - then offer to conclude a contract - this will bind the customer's ‚Äúwish list‚Äù if you compile it correctly and do not force you to spend extra forces on reducing the payment. <br><br>  <strong>7. "I will pay you 20% of the cost of the work, and after creating the project - the rest of the amount you will receive advertising on our project"</strong> <br><br>  Remember - there is no guarantee that the project will be successful and you can at least somehow repulse your work expenses, not to mention profit.  And placing advertisements on an empty resource doesn‚Äôt give you the opportunity to get feedback from work.  Naturally, the customer will begin to tell you that "now there is no money for promotion," and other nonsense.  In fact, he just saved on you. <br><br>  <strong>8. ‚ÄúThe project is non-profit, there is no budget.</strong>  <strong>But you are ready to work on the portfolio?</strong>  <strong>Then we have a bunch of commercial projects. ‚Äù</strong> <br><br>  If you are a beginner freelancer, this is a good alternative if there is no portfolio.  However, if you already have a lot of work left, then why should you spend your time on a free project with sweet breakfasts?  Most likely this is another way to save money. <br><br>  <strong>9. ‚ÄúI believe that you are a professional (2K text goes on about how good you are).</strong>  <strong>I ask you - I have sick relatives, make it cheaper, I beg ‚Äù</strong> <br><br>  Another desire to "persuade". <br><br>  <strong>10. ‚ÄúYou what?</strong>  <strong>There is no such price!</strong>  <strong>Come on, you‚Äôll make it N% cheaper if you do it well - I‚Äôll pay more. ‚Äù</strong> <br><br>  Most likely, nothing will be paid in addition, the customer either does not have so much money, but wants good quality, like you, or is trying to save. <br><br>  <strong>Attention!</strong>  Of all these tricks - there are exceptions, so carefully read what you are offered and analyzed and only then make a decision. <br><br><br>  Original - <a href="http://malkin.com.ua/2007/07/20/10-ulovok-zakazchikov-chtobi-platit-vam-menshe/">in the blog about freelancing</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/15148/">https://habr.com/ru/post/15148/</a></p>
