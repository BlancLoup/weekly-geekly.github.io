  <section class="page js-page"><h1>A pair of daggers in the back of paid music services</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  One of the popular services that allowed listening to music online, Last.FM became paid.  This is probably known to all those interested.  When they just announced this, I searched and found for them a nice alternative - the service <a href="http://www.spotify.com/">www.spotify.com</a> . <br><br>  The main obstacle to its use is its payment for users from third world countries like Ukraine.  Yes, there are opportunities to get registration allegedly from a resident, for example, the UK and the price for access to the music archives will only be remorse of your conscience.  But the music base, and the quality received in return for the monthly fee, made me buy a subscription for one month. <br><br>  And then the fun began.  Despite the fact that I bought a ticket, I still attributed to the people of the second grade.  Now and then, opposite to musical compositions, it was beautiful: ‚ÄúThis work is currently unavailable for Ukraine.‚Äù  (I vividly presented the picture when I was taken out from the middle of a concert, for example, at the Vienna Opera, since the next work is not for the ears of Ukrainian citizens.) 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      Moreover, the compositions that I previously had the opportunity to listen to began to be transferred to this category. <br><br>  The only thing that still keeps me on this service is that, at the end of the subscription period, I was not blocked from accessing the service.  Ie, rather because of the flaw in the service itself, I was stuck somewhere in the neutral zone, where the music from that side is audible, but not all. <br><br>  Well, I thought, since I got so drunk, I‚Äôll take a closer look at Last.fm, they‚Äôre asking for less money: $ 3 versus 9.99 euros.  And this morning I found out that the compositions to which I gave a link in my LJ two weeks ago, just disappeared. <br><br>  &lt;irony&gt; Undoubtedly, this is a very successful marketing ploy of rights holders - to remove or restrict access to broadcast music on the Internet.  Now everyone rushes to buy music on discs. &lt;/ Irony&gt; <br><br>  What are the arguments for removing the limitations of online music broadcasts on the Internet?  The quality of the bitrate is enough for the music to buzz in the background in the speakers, but far from enough to get real pleasure from the music.  To whom quality is not important, and so it does.  ‚ÄúI heard - I liked it - I bought the album / went to the concert / recommended it‚Äù - this is more logical and more reliable than ‚ÄúI heard about ... - I took a chance - I bought it - I threw it away‚Äù.  For recyclables immeasurably more. <br><br>  Re-read "Long Tail", or something. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/60696/">https://habr.com/ru/post/60696/</a></p>
