The first month of kubish.ru cashback service in Russia</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2d4/a6d/2fe/2d4a6d2fe2a14b9abbd569e9983de34b.png"><br>  Thanks to Habrozhiteli, who positively met the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/cloverr/blog/246519/">welcome post</a> on Habr√©, as we did on <a href="http://kubish.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dlink%26utm_content%3Dheader%26utm_campaign%3Dperviy-mesyac%26utm_term%3Dperviy-mesyac">kubish.ru</a> cashback service.  Many wrote to us, offered help and took advantage of the service.  Thanks to those who found bugs, we hurried to fix them and we will be grateful for future reviews. <br><br>  We had a long thought about the format in which to communicate with the world of customers and caring users, and we were hooked on the concept of openness, which <a href="http://www.quicksprout.com/2015/01/12/how-transparency-is-the-new-marketing/">Neil Patel</a> recently outlined well. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The bottom line is that you need to be open with your audience, showing the maximum number of metrics, tactics and moves by which you can track company results.  This strategy, in addition to generating additional traffic, also helps to get a loyal audience to the company and service.  Openness is not only sharing your successes and victories with users, but also the problems that you face face to face, which knock you out of a rut and make you stronger.

      Inspired by the experience of companies such as <a href="http://moz.com/blog/mozs-2013-year-in-review">Moz</a> , <a href="https://www.groovehq.com/blog">Groove</a> , <a href="https://open.bufferapp.com/">BufferOpen</a> and others who are moving forward due to their openness, regularly revealing to the world profit figures, regardless of whether the period was successful or not.  For example, in this <a href="http://moz.com/blog/mozs-2013-year-in-review">article,</a> Moz talks about how they lost 5.7 million dollars.  They talk about the growth that they managed to get and the directions in which they became better. <br><br>  So, here are some results that managed to get for a month of work kubish.ru in Russia: <br><br>  <b>1. Visitors</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/938/8aa/244/9388aa244e8246f6a08f411423fecb9b.png"><br><br>  In a month, we received 17,969 visits, or 14,152 unique visitors. <br>  Many visits were from the media and Habr.  After the release of the news about the launch of the service, many rewarded the information about us, for which many thanks to them.  The most thoughtful owners of information resources published their referral link to us, which helped them get a bunch of referrals, for each of which 50 bonus cents and 10% from each cashback of the referral are charged. <br><br>  <b>2. Registrations</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/182/eeb/ff6/182eebff69194d2594f65890abe125e3.png"><br><br>  This led to the registration of 829 users, among them 168 referral ones. <br><br>  <b>3. Shopping</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/930/193/b6e/930193b6ed7c477d83cc8f993c5d9101.png"><br><br>  128 purchases per month is a little more than 4 purchases per day, which is very good considering the holidays.  However, this is very far from our annual goal, which is 1000 purchases per day. <br><br>  <b>4. Turnover</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a07/1a3/71a/a071a371a2ce4e03866742e04588de1a.png"><br><br>  Almost 500 thousand rubles were bought by clients within a month through our service. <br><br>  <b>5. Channels of attraction</b> <br>  -Media and journalists <br>  This channel was one of the most effective.  Over the past month, 16 publications and interviews were published about us, which allowed us to tell the audience in detail about the service, to get a lot of registrations and requests for cooperation. <br><br>  -Blogs <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/cloverr/">Habr</a> , <a href="http://spark.ru/startup/cloverr">Spark</a> , <a href="http://kubish.ru/blog/">own blog</a> .  Also bring a good share of registrations. <br><br>  -Contextual advertising <br>  We managed to set up fairly cheap campaigns, and we continue to hone models for attracting audiences from search advertising in Yandex and Google, from thematic sites.  We recently launched an ad in the video and in the next report we will tell about the results. <br><br>  -Social networks <br>  We are present in all social networks and held a contest in the <a href="http://vk.com/clovrr">VC</a> this month, which brought almost 1000 new subscribers and many registrations.  Plans to launch something big for Valentine's Day. <br><br>  Referral traffic <br>  We will continue to develop the referral mechanism, and perhaps soon will offer more chips for webmasters and sites. <br><br>  -SEO <br>  So far, this channel is in its infancy.  The person who started doing it, unfortunately, could not join the rhythm of the company and had to refuse his services. <br><br>  -Email mailing <br>  Only just started and look at the result. <br><br>  -Video <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/xXRmL4mQ4Vg%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiZ4SubXye75R4mY1plmCCfaT70Jg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  We plan to release such videos to talk about the service. <br><br>  <b>6. Pro tracking</b> <br>  Be sure to use UTM tags so that traffic sources can be tracked.  It is very important to understand where and how many visitors came from and which of them was converted into registration and sale.  We try to fix all these metrics. <br><br>  7. Technical files <br>  We unfortunately did not release the scheduled mobile applications and browser extension.  Partly because there are so many distractions that need to be solved here and now, and partly because the development is two-way and requires development both on the client and on the server. <br><br>  Another technical file is related to the fact that not all partners give us information on users in full.  Unfortunately, the place that, for Western partners, works like a clock in Russian realities is not always correct.  We have to do a lot of manual work, communicate with customers and partners. <br><br>  That's all for today and thanks for the positive feedback!  We hope our experience will inspire someone to certain actions.  If readers like this format of publications, we will continue to talk about our results. <br><br>  To continue to monitor our progress, you can simply subscribe to this blog and in return we will share our lessons and strategies that we use in the company. <br><br>  PS Sign up and be sure to get cashback from your online purchases on <a href="http://kubish.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dlink%26utm_content%3Dfooter%26utm_campaign%3Dperviy-mesyac%26utm_term%3Dperviy-mesyac">kubish.ru</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/248057/">https://habr.com/ru/post/248057/</a></p>
