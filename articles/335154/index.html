  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Mobile applications: how to avoid a ban from the advertising network?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/a19/ac3/e14/a19ac3e144c54d9c86e5ea883adb525c.gif"></div><br>  Did you work hard on the game and plan your advertising strategy only so that the advertising mediation platform banned or rejected your application?  This really happens - and it seems that this is not the most favorable development of events.  In addition, some platforms and networks hide the reasons for the ban from users, and their decisions seem suspicious.  We understand how to make the application in good standing with all ad networks and prevent problems related to their integration. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Are you doing everything right? </h4><br><ul><li>  First of all, we recommend that you make sure that you personally manage the types of advertising in the application, and it is you who chose which ads will be displayed - that is, there are no third-party unknown banners, videos, etc. <br><br></li><li>  Never ask users for clicks - there should not be special CTA messages in the application that ask players to interact with any advertising. <br><br></li><li>  Advertising must not overlap the interactive elements in the application.  For example, a banner should not close a frequently used menu button, or a full-screen ad should not pop up after each click or gesture.  Advertising should not hide the main content and prevent the user from interacting with the application. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
    </li><li>  Advertising should not be shown immediately when the application starts, as well as when the device is returned from sleep mode or when the game itself is in ‚Äúminimized‚Äù mode. <br><br></li><li>  Do not show ads on screens without content ‚Äî for example, on log in / log out screens, or on screens with errors, words of gratitude, or information about creators.  The logic here is this: the listed types of screens usually pop up when you open or close an application, after an in-game purchase or download of any actions - in all these cases, advertising is prohibited to show. <br><br></li><li>  Do not show full-screen advertising at random moments of the game, when the probability of random clicks increases. <br><br></li><li>  Do not show full-screen ads one by one - after the player has already closed one ad, the next one should not pursue it. <br><br></li><li>  There should be only one banner on the screen at a time - never lay the banners on top of each other. </li></ul><br>  If the application violates any of these rules, the mediator should alert the developer.  Usually the publisher is given two weeks to correct errors.  For example, we at Appodeal are ready to answer questions during this entire period and help the developer fix errors.  It is very important to correct all violations within two weeks.  This is necessary not only to the mediator, but to the developer himself, because advertising networks can find violations and even ban you on their own without our participation. <br><br>  As a rule, our account managers not only direct developers and give advice on how to correct violations, but also help to optimize the results from advertising.  Below are tips on optimization strategies from Appodeal account managers. <br><br><h4>  Optimization strategy </h4><br><ul><li>  Analyze whether ad formats are appropriate for your application and how compatible they are with those that already work.  Remember that too much advertising has a negative effect on user retention (retention rate) and eCPM, so it is important to take into account what kind of advertising you show and in what amounts.  For example, it is known that rewarded video has a positive effect on user retention.  More information about this format and the best scenarios for the show can be found here. <br><br></li><li>  If the same ad is shown too often, consider setting a minimum price level (price floor) or frequency caps to minimize the negative effect. <br><br></li><li>  For some applications, the 15-second default banner update period may be too short.  In this case, experiments with the duration of the renewal period and monitoring of the ARPDAU indicator may be useful. <br><br></li><li>  If your application is non-fiction, and its interface is mostly texts or lists, consider the native ad option in addition to banners.  Such a technique should have a good effect on the retention rate. <br><br></li><li>  If your application has internal purchases, try to enhance their effect with Rewarded Video (watching videos for a fee).  Built-in purchases are effective only for a very small percentage of users - only 2-3% of the majority.  Rewarded Video significantly increase revenue and encourage non-paying users to interact with advertising, thus bringing previously unavailable income. </li></ul><br>  Compliance with all the rules in the post guarantees a long and happy relationship with all networks.  Ban from networks is clearly not what every publisher wants, especially from such as AdMob, with whom it is difficult to start work anew.  We hope that the two sets of rules that we have prepared will help you to monetize successfully and without any problems. <br><br>  If you want to dig deeper and increase the Display Rate (and revenues) due to a competent advertising load - read <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/appodeal/blog/333336/">our article at the link</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/335154/">https://habr.com/ru/post/335154/</a></p>
