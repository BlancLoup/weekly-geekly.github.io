Most of the ‚Äúwork‚Äù was given to professionals, and this is not because I am ‚Äúso very handy‚Äù (although this is also present), but because I want to use things that satisfy my requirements.  And it will be very long, nervously, dreary =&gt; expensive to make such ones on their own (and it‚Äôs not a fact that they will).

      As a matter of fact, guided by this rule, nothing personally was done by me in the last repair. ‚ò∫ <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h6>  So, the source data: </h6><br><ul><li>  Study area in the bedroom </li><li>  Installed bed and dressing room, and as a result, the specific colors of the facades and the specific style of the space </li><li>  The need for a workplace for me and my spouse </li><li>  The need for analogue "dressing table" for the wife </li><li>  Unwillingness to share 1 table between mine and iMac and spouse wike </li></ul><br>  It should be noted that this is not my main workplace - but a home analogue, for the evening / day off in my free time.  Yes, and the spouse spends at work no more than 3-4 hours a day (in any case, I really want to think so ...). <br><br>  In the design project of an apartment, the bedroom was not elaborated in detail because  they thought that we would be far from arranging this part of the house, and in case of ‚Äúwhat‚Äù we would manage on our own.  So it cost: <br><br><h5>  1. Made a number of requirements: </h5><br><h6>  General requirements for the workplace: </h6><br><ul><li>  Aesthetic look in the style of the room </li><li>  Do not clutter the space </li><li>  Hide everything you need to hide and remove everything you need to clean </li><li>  Place for MFP </li><li>  Analogue sill for placing flowers </li><li>  Providing electricity to all possible users </li></ul><br><h6>  Requirements for my place: </h6><br><ul><li>  Working surface at least 120x80 </li><li>  The working surface on which you can draw without moving the computer </li><li>  Boxes for documents, wiring, hardware, gadgets, other </li></ul><br><h6>  Requirements for the place of spouse: </h6><br><ul><li>  Small place for laptop </li><li>  Place for table mirror </li><li>  Boxes for cosmetics </li></ul><br><br><h5>  2. Get on the Internet and see what is </h5><br>  Basically, we limited ourselves to watching a few topics of Mr. <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/grokru/" class="user_link">Grokru</a> on the theme <i>‚ÄúJobs of freelancers from around the world‚Äù</i> and realized that there is nothing good, and to be honest - satisfying to our hotelkeepers - there is no such thing in boarding schools. <br><br><h6>  But they emphasized a couple of interesting ideas: </h6><br><ul><li>  The corner table is convenient to use for 2 tasks (work at the computer and pencil notes) </li><li>  At the corner table should not be legs in the place of pairing </li><li>  It would be fun to make a pseudo-sill to put flowers.  (Due to technological limitations in glazing \ weathe loggia sill we did not have) </li><li>  Despite the fact that our whole apartment is white, the table also wants a bright </li></ul><br><br><h5>  3. Then everything was very simple: </h5><br><ol><li>  I painted a simple sketch (I drew it in MS Word :) did not find anything more convenient): <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5d1/47a/c2c/5d147ac2ca8c3ebfd09c96847900c43c.png"></li><li>  Sent to a furniture maker who created 95% of the furniture for my house </li><li>  I asked the designer how best to arrange the colors (I remind them we had 2 - wooden and white) </li><li>  At this time, the furniture maker outlined how and for how much these things really do.  The output is as follows: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f4d/f30/96a/f4df3096a7d487d072e33fdb8cfa5230.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7f8/354/4e4/7f83544e446480cbace584dac9abfbba.png"></li><li>  Ordered </li><li>  After 2 weeks everything fell into place </li></ol><br><br><h5>  File </h5><br>  Of the small ‚Äúimprovements to the evening,‚Äù it remains only to push the wires to all consumers, and to find a place for an MFP, which of course I forgot about when ordering.  But removing one of the central shelves, my multifunctional home found an excellent home, and several extension cords, a surge protector, screeds, several screws and fasteners for the wire did their job. <br><br><h5>  See the result: </h5><br>  View from the room: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ad6/926/4f7/ad69264f74d41e8b2ba130abfbce7a6a.jpg"><br><br>  View from the door: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d73/ed6/269/d73ed6269aca39256cdad91417ff530c.jpg"><br><br>  View from the other side: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/545/72c/442/54572c442c90d4068f2a9d9a12059237.jpg"><br><br>  View along the window: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7de/fd8/d34/7defd8d342f0bd1fc5e3fa3e345044c9.jpg"><br><br>  Accessories (on my 2 such left and right): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cab/7b7/63e/cab7b763eb384aeec57cac0c4e026be1.jpg"><br><br>  The underframe at the place of the spouse (it is not realistic to remove it from the wall, because the depth of the tabletop is only 50 cm, it was necessary to move the stiffener to the wall as much as possible): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b02/533/df2/b02533df2369a9bd9e66bb361fae5352.jpg"><br><br>  Location of the multifunctional office: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/380/2e7/ce8/3802e7ce8bae824b83a8ff1a473c688b.jpg"><br><br>  My leads: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1c2/7a3/790/1c27a3790a9eaa751681c062e6bda8d8.jpg"><br><br>  Well, the picture from the height of the <s>bird's</s> <a href="">nose</a> you saw at the beginning. <br><br><h5>  A couple of comments: </h5><br><ul><li>  Work chairs yet.  Put the kitchen for beauty :) </li><li>  The curtains were ordered after ordering the table (when it became clear what was going on.) </li><li>  I don‚Äôt want to get up because of this place, so the goal is fulfilled - which is what you want. </li><li>  Poppy I do not connect via RJ45, because  when copying files to the NAS by wire - reading from it (NAS) becomes impossible (read players, also by wire).  Therefore, I am writing through the air, and reading through the wires :) Who can solve this bug is my strong thanks. </li><li>  I do not know how to take pictures and lazy to learn, so kick someone you want. </li></ul><br><br><h5>  My morals </h5><br>  People, do not limit yourself to IKEA and other stores of finished furniture, create, create, customize!  The environment (and furniture in particular), sharpened for you, to the creation of which you put more than 5 minutes in the store and N amount of money, give incomparably more pleasure and positive. <br><br>  UPDATE1: Forgot to specify the main thing - the price. <br><ul><li>  The price for making the table was 31 tons.  (at this price, everything is design, materials, installation, lifting, warranty, boxes with car snoods, fittings, good attitude, and Asti bottles for housewarming) </li><li>  Surge protectors, extenders - a legacy from an old apartment </li><li>  The time I spent is a few hours. </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/157351/">https://habr.com/ru/post/157351/</a></p>
