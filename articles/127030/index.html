Hard hit the team of like-minded people.  This is a time of hard and quite successful work in the Pinpoint team ( <a href="http://pin.pn/">http://pin.pn</a> ).  An unusual and original startup, through the eyes of a direct participant in a productive disgrace.  Immediately I confess, in order to avoid excessive flooding, that the video is lower and the pictures are not mine.  In order not to bother with grabbing, I got hold of different screens from our ideologue with his permission (they didn‚Äôt please him). <br><br><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/27967905&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgEUDmRY4lMKXGx1Zoo17ISPyKJZQ" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" title="Pinpoint.

      Herodotus, Marco Polo, Vasco da Gama, Christopher Columbus, Francis Drake, Athanasius Nikitin, Fernand Magellan.  Almost every one of us, at least once in childhood or adolescence, dreamed of inscribing his name in this series of famous travelers and seafarers.  And I am sure that dreams must come true!  Therefore, sensing ourselves as the masters of our own destiny, we came up with and realized our dream - the Pinpoint project, which allows each person to discover his own world and show how his life proceeds in a personal coordinate system. <br><br><h4>  Why reinvent the wheel ... </h4><br>  We have seen many services: different and diverse, with interesting functionality and with unnecessary features, convenient and sometimes mysterious.  Why reinvent the wheel, if we have already invented all the details that work reliably?  Therefore, in Pinpoint you can find a lot of what services have geolocation information.  We just made it easier, clearer and more interesting! <br>  All information that is accumulated on the service in the form of pins (points with semantic content) is formed in a single database and immediately displayed on a single global map of the world. <br>  So, with a pin you can easily mark a house, a cafe, a place for a party, a monument, etc.  At the same time, an individual name and a page with information ( <a href="http://pin.pn/Manneken-Pis">http://pin.pn/Manneken-Pis</a> ) are associated with each such object marked with a pin.  At the same time, each pin has different levels of privacy (now there are two of them - private and public, but the third is already being tested - the secret), which means you control those who open this information and who do not.  In short, you can create your version of the world and dispose of it completely.  I think it's cool! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/1594328e/4270845b/9020a378/4229162d.png"><br><br>  Different places on the map, marked with pins, we can combine into arbitrary thematic groups, sets: visible and invisible to the general public.  Conveniently!  So, if we continue the theme of the sights of Brussels, then they can be viewed on the set <a href="http://pin.pn/set/2613">http://pin.pn/set/2613</a> .  Of course, it is clear that we haven‚Äôt ‚Äúscrewed up‚Äù here yet: you can add the name to the set URL a little later. <br><br>  Yandex.Maps or Google Maps?  Each map service has its own priorities.  It is known that Google Maps Europe and North America are developed in more detail than Yandex.Maps.  But for Russia, Yandex.Map has a clear handicap.  That's why we made it so that in Pinpoint you can easily switch between the two most popular card systems in the world and Russia.  Moreover, on which engine the pin is set, it will be used by default for it.  Plans to connect Bing as an additional alternative. <br><br>  Search by tags!  Tags in Pinpoint work to the fullest.  One or several, they can be assigned to each pin.  The process itself, thanks to ajax-nymi ficham, turned out simple and intuitive.  As a result, you can ‚Äúin one click‚Äù get a variety of information on a given topic, which users posted.  Well, what is not a collective mind!  :) PS Since each tag has its own page with a map and pins marked on it with this tag, we get an analogue of hashtags on Twitter, but instead of a dynamic tape of tweets, we have a tape of points on the map.  Practical application of this feature, anyone can think of himself. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/d93dc394/373d9709/16edad09/0d8e3cca.png"><br><br>  Traditionally, Pinpoint makes it easy to share and share information on social networks and blogs: sharing &amp; embedding is an integral part of modern online life. <br><br>  And now, about the main feature of the project - the ‚ÄúExplore‚Äù mode.  With it, in one click of the mouse you can get information about all the pins near you and with the places that you are viewing.  And with the help of the same tags, you can quickly choose exactly what you need. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/73f0528e/d2787292/a69e1613/e5356df6.png"><br><br><h4>  What to do with this Pinpoint? </h4><br>  I periodically ask myself this question and hear it from friends and acquaintances.  Here are the answers, for the moment, come to my mind. <br><br>  1. Using Pinpoint you can share events in life: a party, a party, a business event, a date, a journey, mass meetings and everything that you wish for yourself!  Moreover, everything is simple: <br><ol><li>  set the description of the event, the place and conditions of participation </li><li>  organize and report on the meeting at a certain time and place </li><li>  customize the URL as you want (pin.pn/Vecherinka-Vashi) </li><li>  ‚ÄúOne click‚Äù share a link with friends and ‚Äúpartners‚Äù </li></ol><br>  2. Pinpoint is a personal place manager (for some reason, an adequate translation into Russian cannot be settled here, sorry :)). <br><ul><li>  We easily create our own map: we mark places where we go, relax, work, go shopping, note important addresses and interesting events.  You can create a separate set, available ‚Äúin one click‚Äù. </li><li>  we create personal notes on the map: since pins can be made private, you can only mark the city for yourself, or, for example, make to-do notes on certain places.  And then, being on the street, using the Pinpoint mobile app, quickly navigate through the nearby notes.  So, for example, I saw the pin ‚ÄúTake your favorite slippers from Katya‚Äù 400 meters from the current location, immediately call up to her and try to pick up the thing that was accidentally forgotten six months ago :) </li><li>  recommend: where to go and what to do.  Information is stored on the map. </li><li>  We organize logistics for business, creating sets from distribution points, from categories of goods that need to be delivered to specific locations, customer and partner bases, distribution of corporate training sessions and events to branches.  It is also easy to link events in the life of the company to specific places. </li></ul><br>  3. Mobile application <br>  Pinpoint in your smartphone is just some center of the universe: all the pins around and near you dynamically form the information landscape.  The created pin is easily attached to the point where you are, and instantly becomes part of all the information available on the service.  At any time you can both create and delete a created pin, if it is no longer relevant.  The iPhone application is now being actively tested and will be available for download in a couple of weeks. <br><br><h4>  So what is this pinpoint? </h4><br>  It is an organizer of personal geolocation data and business activities. <br><br>  Everything, took the soul.  Now back to the project, which for the team, as indicated in the logo, is now truly - Stellar Nursery. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/127030/">https://habr.com/ru/post/127030/</a></p>
