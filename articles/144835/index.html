      HP Folio 13-2000 can be called minimal, except for a standard-sized charger, only a quick start guide is included.  There are no useful gadgets in the box, which is very distressing for a device with a price tag of about 40 thousand rubles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/eff/22e/82f/eff22e82f733690a1b9ddfe536b0dc36.jpg"><br><br>  Specifications are quite typical for the first wave of ultrabooks and do not constitute anything supernatural, rather the opposite. <br><br><table><tbody><tr><td>  CPU </td><td>  Intel Core i5 2467M (1.6 GHz), 2 cores, L3 3 MB cache, NT, TDP 17 W </td></tr><tr><td>  Chipset </td><td>  Intel HM65 Express, TDP 3.4 W </td></tr><tr><td>  RAM </td><td>  4 GB DDR3 1333 MHz in single-channel mode, one slot total. </td></tr><tr><td>  Video card </td><td>  Intel HD Graphics 3000 </td></tr><tr><td>  Network devices </td><td>  Wi-Fi 802.11 b / g / n, Bluetooth 3.0 (Intel Centrino Wireless N 1030), Gigabit Ethernet (Realtek 8211) </td></tr><tr><td>  Storage System </td><td>  SSD: Samsung 128Gb SATA II (mSATA Interface) </td></tr><tr><td>  Integrated devices </td><td>  1.3 MP webcam, microphone, card reader </td></tr><tr><td>  Ports for connecting devices </td><td>  One USB 2.0 port, one USB 3.0 port, one HDMI port, one audio jack (headphone and microphone), one Gigabit Ethernet port, SD / SDHC / SDXC / MMC card reader </td></tr><tr><td>  Display </td><td>  13.3 ‚Äù, resolution 1366 * 768, Glossy, TN, LED backlight </td></tr><tr><td>  Battery </td><td>  6-section, Li-Ion, 59 W / h </td></tr><tr><td>  Weight </td><td>  1.5 kg </td></tr></tbody></table><br><br>  Externally, the HP Folio 13-2000 looks solid, albeit discreetly.  The fact is that only the upper part of the ultrabook is metallic, while the bottom is made of rough black plastic.  In all other respects, the design is OK.  I always liked the inconspicuous rectangles of polished aluminum, at least half). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b12/c73/c7c/b12c73c7c8261ca54e1c6bf09f85eeca.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d7e/c85/829/d7ec85829675bacb11dadb18c858cec8.jpg"><br><br>  In the opened form, the HP Folio 13-2000 doesn‚Äôt stand out in the same way and is made a lower class in the image and likeness of many other ultrabooks and fellows. <br><br>  The keyboard is made according to the recently popular principle of separate buttons, but the insertion between the buttons is made of shiny and brand plastic, which does not add solidity to the appearance.  The buttons have a soft, albeit small move, the characters are large and clear.  Several keys have an additional LED of their own, which lights up when using certain functions.  In general, typing behind such a keyboard is quite nice, you get used to the layout quickly.  It is especially convenient to work with such a keyboard in the dark, the backlight of the keys is made quite successfully, although some buttons are highlighted unevenly. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a0d/f8d/b64/a0df8db64d49ddfa29f59262cc074e9e.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9c6/c86/21c/9c6c8621c1a26dd08181204941decc52.jpg"><br><br>  Under the keyboard is a touchpad of impressive size, it is sensitive and comfortable.  Functional buttons imitating the mouse are hidden along the lower edges of the touchpad. To work, you need to press harder on the left or right part at the bottom of the touch field.  You can also turn it off completely by tapping your finger on the upper left area, and an orange LED lights up above the touchpad. <br><br>  In using the touchpad almost did not cause complaints, the finger glides over the surface easily, without discomfort.  Perhaps the ‚Äúbuttons‚Äù on the touchpad will seem tight to you, but I do not consider this to be a significant inconvenience, since I almost never use them.  Multitouch support is also good, especially considering the decent size of the touch surface. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a86/0ff/a77/a860ffa77fc666fcdb44d1bbe59fbb48.jpg"><br><br>  All connectors for connecting additional devices are located on both sides of the ultrabook.  On the right hand there is a universal headphone / microphone jack and a USB 2.0 port, on the left side is a card reader, another USB jack (this time 3.0), a charging jack and HDMI. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/646/fd8/6b3/646fd86b3c421ccb6ff8c831f3e10d77.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8ce/887/345/8ce887345cb32aa2b07d4d18ddc58655.jpg"><br><br>  Also there is a two-color indicator of the connection of the charger and the activity LEDs of the card reader and the hard disk.  The location of the LEDs is inconvenient, to see what is happening you need to either turn the ultrabook or turn the head.  But the interface connectors are well positioned, but there are only two USB ports, which, although it is a necessary minimum, may in some situations limit the functionality of the ultrabook and its usability.  At the manufacturer‚Äôs site, I would add at least two more USB ports, one of which would be at the back.  With the power of USBs, everything is in order, the manufacturer states that the HP Folio 13-2000 can feed a USB device with a consumption of up to 2A. <br><br>  The display is based on a glossy TN matrix with LED backlighting.  A modest resolution of just 1366x768.  Viewing angles, especially vertically, cannot be called good; when you change the position of the display, the picture begins to fade almost immediately.  But the screen brightness is enough with a margin, to raise it by more than 50% is unlikely when you need it. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9c8/d39/f63/9c8d39f63d319ab75a9349c1a2f344e1.jpg"><br>  The audio system is based on the exotic IDC 92HD99 codec, inside the case there are two speakers that support the Dolby format.  There are no complaints about the sound, on the contrary, I was surprised by the volume and clarity of the sound of the built-in audio system.  No extraneous noise or wheezing during watching a video, or listening to music was noticed.  The hole in the built-in microphone is located on the left edge of the keyboard. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d8c/275/a83/d8c275a83a4d4b163e46f45b059ecb6b.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6b4/6fc/a7b/6b46fca7bc88036be8ffd26964aec0ad.jpg"><br><br>  Under the hood, this friend has quite an ultrabook stuffing.  The dual-core Intel Core i5 2467M processor operates in the frequency range from 800 MHz to 2.3 GHz, using TurboBoost technology.  The nominal upper limit for it is a more modest 1.6 GHz.  HT technology allows you to simultaneously process up to 4 threads. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/636/962/d0b/636962d0be176cc9721077598bdcc396.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ed4/897/64f/ed489764f17010fd46e7a18b152a2df3.png"><br><br>  The processor is a representative of the Sandy Bridge family, it is manufactured using a 32Nm process technology.  Intel HD Graphics 3000 video system is integrated into the processor, the graphics core operates at a frequency of 350 to 1100 MHz. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f59/c8f/04e/f59c8f04e3d10494ef2ba8beb7466681.png"><br><br>  Samsung SSD has a capacity of 128GB and is connected via SATA2 interface using mSATA connector.  The speed of this drive is very decent, although not outstanding, compared to desktop solutions on SATA3.  The operating system Windows 7 Professional X64 is loaded and works very quickly. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a1d/78a/c3a/a1d78ac3ae2323d67fcc00f879d587ef.png"><br><br>  The entire possible amount of RAM is typed at the expense of a single 4GB module manufactured by Hyundai Electronics operating at an effective frequency of 1333 MHz. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/73f/004/aeb/73f004aeb2f2f2e3b6cd53e2b899ae80.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/091/b5e/e74/091b5ee7431461842516b40c94b207bc.png"><br>  That is, there is no particular reason for replacing memory, as well as the possibility to increase its volume.  Due to the work in single-channel mode, the memory subsystem demonstrates very modest throughput performance. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cc2/961/e5a/cc2961e5aa31a41d0f472afe5f197fb5.png"><br><br>  Wireless capabilities are implemented through the adapter Intel Centrino Wireless N 1030, which provides support for Wi-Fi b / g / n standard and Bluetooth 3.0.  Time passes and Centrino is now a network card, not a notebook platform.  By cable HP Folio 13-2000 communicates with the outside world through a network card Realtek 8211. <br><br>  So far, the impressions of the ultrabook I have quite mixed, the performance measurements should help to figure out what's what. <br><br>  Performance evaluation by OS forces shows that the weakest link is the speed with Aero.  Well, okay, this fad does not upset me at all, especially since the rest of tsiferki look more impressive. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/598/e79/b6d/598e79b6d46412e0a6936968fef67122.png"><br><br>  After the launch of a pair of not the freshest 3DMark enthusiasm, the scored points show only that in 3D my test subject is not at all strong, despite optimistic estimates of the operating system.  In online toys such as World of Warcraft or the like to play it will turn out, but no more. <br><br>  <b>3DMark2006:</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/be3/80a/025/be380a025db85d6b410f0a5c6c29da59.png"><br><br>  <b>3DMark Vantage:</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d15/54a/a05/d1554aa05cd5dbd846b3a9462d8b8567.png"><br><br>  Measuring the speed of the SSD drive shows only that everything is fine with it, without surprises such as low write speed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e31/ace/6c7/e31ace6c71245bd2474fdd7eb332c354.png"><br><br>  <b>PCMark 7:</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1b2/26b/c4d/1b226bc4ddb750157a64c9d949941d01.png"><br><br>  <b>PCMark Vantage:</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/db6/01a/482/db601a482b7a7070f1b655a3b3464f81.png"><br><br>  The PCMark 7 and PCMark Vantage tests somewhat improve the overall impression of the device, it works a bit faster against the background of the clones.  More precisely - by <b>712</b> and <b>2408</b> points faster than <b>Toshiba Portege Z830</b> and <b>1265</b> and <b>3124</b> faster than <b>Acer Aspire S3</b> .  Here they are, the advantages of a quick-on SSD recording <br><br>  In the test for the autonomy of <b>Futuremark - PowerMark</b> , HP Folio 13-2000 lasted <b>4 hours and 4 minutes</b> with a Balanced profile, display brightness of about 70% and the backlight turned off.  This result is a good achievement, even against the background of other ultrabooks.  <b>Toshiba Portege Z830</b> lasted only <b>2</b> hours <b>49</b> minutes in this test, <b>Acer Aspire S3</b> <b>2</b> hours <b>29</b> minutes, so our hero is in the lead in terms of survivability.  In many ways, this is achieved through a 6-cell battery with a capacity of 59W / h and an overall low power consumption of used components. <br><br>  In the process of work, the ultrabook makes a noisy noise, starting to howl softly under load.  Turning off the ‚ÄúFan Always On‚Äù function in the BIOS does not affect the situation.  The noise level at the partial overlap of the ventilation holes grows almost instantly, so working with the beech on the knees or putting it on a soft surface will be uncomfortable.  Looking at these thermal sensors, one wants to tempt fate even less.  The measured maximum temperature of the processor in 81 'during the passage of PCMark Vantage frankly does not please, especially considering the fact that the ultrabook was installed on a flat surface and the ventilation grilles were not even partially blocked. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b2f/9f2/50c/b2f9f250c09abf08baf36f16de97fad3.png"><br><br>  In my opinion, HP Folio 13-2000 is suitable primarily for employees of the corporate sector, as a traveling machine from office to office.  Working with him at home or somewhere on the knee is not convenient, mainly due to the weakness of the cooling system, which requires a flat surface under the bottom.  There are no complaints about the stuffing, a powerful processor and enough memory together with a fast and rather capacious SSD will provide a decent level of performance for any work tasks, except for toys.  We should also note the backlight of the keyboard, which will be very useful when conducting a presentation in a darkened room or typing in the dark.  In conclusion, I will say a few words about the operating system, more precisely about how it looks.  Frankly speaking, the ‚ÄúSeven‚Äù pre-installed in HP Folio 13-2000 is the only one for which there are no serious complaints.  The necessary minimum is set to ensure the correct operation of the touchpad and function buttons, and the role of the antivirus is Microsoft Security Essentials, and not something paid and trial.  No ugly toys and sponsor tags.  The system rollback also works flawlessly.  In general, in terms of pre-installed software, sheer goodness and beauty. <br><br>  <b>Pros:</b> <br>  - Long battery life. <br>  - Keyboard backlight. <br>  - Powerful USB ports. <br>  - Good sound embedded system. <br>  - Not preloaded with overloaded software pre-installed OS. <br><br>  <b>Minuses:</b> <br>  - Weak and noisy cooling system. <br>  - Glossy matrix with small viewing angles. <br>  - Insufficient number of USB ports. <br>  - Brand plastic between the keys. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/144835/">https://habr.com/ru/post/144835/</a></p>
