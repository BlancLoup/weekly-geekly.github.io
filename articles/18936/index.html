  <section class="page js-page"><h1>ppp vs www as an idea to create a distributed network</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Now the whole Internet is built on distributed servers.  All web applications are executed on servers and data is transmitted to users.  Obviously, this state of affairs makes the Internet not equal - the giants' companies have more resources and can afford to launch larger projects.  They even collect equipment specifically for their needs and are not dependent on suppliers. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Now no one notices that companies like MS, Google, Yahoo are dragging the entire web onto their servers, their share in global traffic is increasing significantly.  They parasitize on the content of other resources, providing a search for them.  In fact, users come for content in a search engine, and not to a resource.  The search engine is a universal content aggregator.  This versatility creates a monopoly of search engines for information on the Internet.  Search engines are closed hierarchical systems; they can influence the output of information by changing the indexing algorithm.  In fact, they can affect the content of the Internet. <br><br>  On the other hand, there are open protocols, the most standardized of which is bittorent, the author of which is an ingenious psycho.  But at the moment, this protocol does not fulfill what the web gives users and search engines ‚Äî it does not aggregate information.  Those.  There is no such tracker or torrent that would represent a clear and complete solution for users.  All resources are integrated with www.

        </script>
      <br>
      Such a development is dead-end - search engines are already replacing www-parts of trackers and giving a search on the content of torrents.  That is exactly what the operatives of the ‚ÄúK‚Äù department find - Google, Yandex, Yahu - they all index your websites.  Welcome to the territory of Big Brother!  If you forbid search engines from indexing a site, then the share of conversions from search engines will disappear, which is usually very important for site owners. <br><br>  In our opinion, http as the basis of www is an outdated protocol of the times of corporations and mainframes.  Berners Lee designed it because  in the conditions of the slow Internet and limited resources of users only such implementation was possible.  At the moment, the user equipment is almost not inferior to some old servers, and by the number significantly exceeds the most huge server platforms.  Moreover, it is being improved much faster than servers.  Internet channels are also constantly expanding.  Soon, half of the globe will have the opportunity to connect the Gigabit Internet. <br><br>  If you combine the thoughts of Berners Lee and the genius - the inventor of the torrent, as well as the ideas of the exchange dht, then you can understand what we mean by ppp!  PPP are sites without physical embodiment, sites.  where all the scripts, all data processing is performed on the user side.  Sites that do not have hosting, but there are visitors, each of which carries a piece of the site and is the embodiment of this piece. <br><br>  To put it simply, users download the site to their machines as soon as the user visits the site, then they receive updates from other visitors, such as comments, content, etc.  Moreover, if he is an active member of such a site.  then he is vitally interested in making his part of the site more accessible - this is his content, which he wants to convey.  The more often a user visits a site, the more parts of it he downloads, <br>  This is like a browser cache, which always remains on the user's machine.  The user can choose the size of this cache according to the capabilities of his car. <br>  This cache is updated every time you visit the site, if the user has set a size limit and they are exhausted, only the most necessary data or data that has little peers are updated. <br><br>  Thus, the number of visitors to the site directly affects its speed - more peers, a better site.  This will avoid duplicate content sites - each piece of content has its own hash key, which identifies it and does not allow users to upload duplicate content to the site.  Facilitated by content search sites, because in fact in this context - this is a search for content on the machines of users. <br><br>  From this concept was born the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe first site of this network.  Naturally, this is a social network for sharing content for users.  This is somewhat not an ordinary network, because  she has no central server.  Network only feasts and no one else. <br><br>  The network is built on a hierarchical structure.  Those.  experienced users lead and suggest beginners, beginners are trained and become experienced users.  The only and permanent currency of this social network is traffic!  The more traffic you give, the more useful your network is.  This is not a restriction on ratios and a ban on downloading files to those who have distributed little, it is a social regulator - you can see in the user profile how rich or poor it is in traffic.  The main point of self-expression in this network.  All users can become pro-users and moderators, for this they need to achieve a certain level of "wealth" and create certain conditions for the functioning of the network (allocate space on their disks, select a wide channel). <br><br>  I'd like to hear opinions about the possibility of implementation, as well as the quality of the idea itself.  The management of my company rejected the idea as inconsistent, but it caused a definite response among the employees.  Perhaps with further elaboration of the idea, we will proceed to the implementation. <br><br>  As always, the question of information security arises.  There is no guarantee that one of the peers will not change the content of the information that it distributes ... In fact, there are no ‚Äúofficial‚Äù sources of information.  Although, ppp does not abolish the use of www.  Critical places can be used "in the old manner" <br><br>  PS: The article was written by me for a long time, was not published anywhere.  In addition to the closed section of my blog. <br><br>  PSS: Why ppp?  Everyone got used to the names of "three letters" (c) PPP = person2person2person :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/18936/">https://habr.com/ru/post/18936/</a></p>
