The customer wants quickly, the investor reliably ‚Äù</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The article is devoted to a real startup. <br>  The article was written by Yuri Vetrov for the information portal about startups <a href="http://live.liveidea.ru/%3Fcat%3D11">Liveidea.ru</a> <br><br>  <strong>Work with startups.</strong>  <strong>The customer wants quickly, the investor - reliably.</strong> <br><br>  We are in the penultimate stage of work on the development of the interface of a single web startup.  The customer company has found an excellent investor, so there is an opportunity to develop a project not through the forces of friends, but as part of a well-established process.  However, in addition to good financing, the investor requires detailed reporting.  And part of this task, as a contractor, falls to our company. <br>  <strong>Briefly about the project.</strong>  <strong>The works are divided into 4 stages:</strong> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  1. preliminary analysis and evaluation of the project.  The customer and the contractor build a general picture of the future system, evaluate the work at a cost and time and plan it; 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

      <br>
      2. interface design and creation of an interactive prototype.  Start of work on the system.  It is necessary to obtain its current model.  First, in order to fix the concept.  Second, test its usability with future users; <br><br>  3. system specification and terms of reference for its development.  Need to put a clear task to the developers.  This will help a series of documents describing the database, system architecture, business logic, work equipment and other points; <br><br>  4. development and launch of the system.  Programming and related work.  According to the result - transferred to the customer. <br><br>  The first difficulties begin with a contract.  Although we have all the stages of work and are painted in sufficient detail, meticulousness at the legislative level is required.  Despite the fact that many of the documents we have made are needed rather for internal use, all of them should be given an unequivocal definition.  Plus, they need to be inventoried.  Of course, it does not reach the list of files, but a list of documents of each type must be attached.  The customer needs the most detailed progress report before it begins. <br><br>  In the course of work, for example, the concept of the interface may change, so you have to make reservations in such places.  But after a long series of edits, everyone was finally satisfied and the contract for the second stage of work was signed. <br><br>  But there are other quirks.  The customer wants to see an estimate of the work at all stages.  As we conclude a separate contract for each of them, he wants to estimate both the total cost and the ratio of the amounts for each of the stages.  The vagueness of the concept (and, accordingly, the amount of work) after the first stage, although it hinders the exact figures, but is solvable.  Approximate figures can be built now, although there is another problem. <br><br>  The project will use an external digital content storage system - the startup plans to make money on it.  Consequently, the amount of programming on our part will be smaller.  But which part is less?  And how many additional resources will be required for the integration of these systems?  Anyway, maybe it would be more expedient to develop the supplier of the external system?  It was chosen by the customer and the model of interaction of the systems was not immediately apparent.  But all the same it turned out, and with it the approximate estimate and plan of work at all stages. <br><br>  Not only we got the extra headache from this, but also the customer himself.  Due to the protracted decision-making process, the project has moved forward, although the customer planned a very quick launch.  But here it is up to them to decide what is more important - the launch speed or a safety net for all cases. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/12687/">https://habr.com/ru/post/12687/</a></p>
