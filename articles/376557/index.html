  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The evolution of the online buyer: how tastes and preferences have changed over the past three years</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <b>Hi, Giktayms!</b>  We, like any large trading network, should be aware of user preferences.  Every sale, every online order, every call to the warranty service affects the purchase and supply of goods for the next day, week, month or even year.  Of course, all this data is carefully collected, stored and cataloged.  And today we would like to share with you information about how consumer preferences of our site <a href="http://mvideo.ru/">mvideo.ru</a> users have changed over the past three years. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d1a/231/e74/d1a231e74c8e4bacbfeb7cfa1b2d197b.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Immediately, we‚Äôll warn you that in this publication all the information will be presented in a rather concise and simplified version, without any pieces of the statistics collection code and specific figures with which the employees of our company operated. <br><br>  First, let's take a look at the general picture we drew for publication:

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a71/1fa/d33/a711fad33d3f4c13848f67c315513f97.jpg"><br><br>  Online user preferences are somewhat different from those who came to the store in person.  Orders through the Internet mostly indulge in young people, hence the love of new technologies, saving time, a healthy lifestyle. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#eb2429">year 2012</font> </h2><br>  The iPad became the king of Internet sales of the 12th year: then the first model with a retina-display appeared.  Not to say that the device revolutionized, but it was the iPad 3 that really made a qualitative improvement in the user experience and the most popular tablet model from Apple. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a4f/85a/c0d/a4f85ac0ddd34e38bf5bd6fe9f6b958a.jpg"><br><br>  Multicookers are in second place in 2012.  If you consider this topic irrelevant, then here is a <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/169579/">publication</a> on Geektimes (which at one time on Habr√© gained more than 500 thousand views). <br><br>  Kitchen technologies in general appear and are popularized by the waves: in the late nineties and the beginning of the two thousandth, aerogrills were on the horse, then they were replaced by microwaves, bread machines were popular, and in 2012 multivarks became one of the best-selling products on our website.  Updating technology in the kitchen does not happen so often, so as soon as a trend appears, everyone massively buys the product, and then uses it for a long time and does not update it. <br><br>  The third place, which is strange, went to the headphones.  It is difficult to explain the demand for headphones - perhaps they were taken as a set with iDevices :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d90/e12/a44/d90e12a443bd4964a15468eee73ccdd8.jpg"><br><br>  The rest of the goods, in principle, fit into the general theory of the "young and healthy consumer": <br><br>  4th place - iPhone, 5th place - scales, 6 - e-books, 7 - auto registrars, 8 - yogurt makers.  In ninth place is not a product, but a whole brand: Tefal.  Closed the top ten - Sony Playstation Portable.  The demand for it is not accidental: with the release in early 2012 of the "replacement" for the old woman-PSP in the face of the new PS Vita, rumors about the end of the production of the old console began to spread.  Prices for the new did not please anyone, the games on it were a cat that wept, so lovers of portable consoles and ran to buy the time-tested PS Portable. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#eb2429">year 2013</font> </h2><br>  The trends of the year before last do not differ much.  Multicookers came out on top.  The growth of popularity, the presence of such a convenient thing with friends, word of mouth and aggressive advertising <s>on Habr√©</s> did their job. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d7a/193/015/d7a19301595b447285831405c84b6294.jpg"><br><br>  The iPad, which prevailed a year earlier, failed right up to the fifth position: why it was necessary to change a perfectly working model to almost the same, but with thin frames, it was not clear to anyone.  Basically, the owners of the first and second series of iPads changed the tablet, but their number was less than those who first decided to take a tablet for themselves. <br><br>  The second place was taken by refrigerators, but the scales went up to the third place. <br><br>  Quite good inexpensive FullHD TVs from LG and Samsung with the Smart TV function raised the popularity of the entire segment (and became the fourth in sales via the Internet), besides the release of a new generation of consoles (PS4 and XBox One) spurred the popularity of good screens.  PS4 itself, by the way, is located in seventh place. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3b7/b4f/010/3b7b4f010e7042acb5e8d517dd7755c2.jpg"><br><br>  On the sixth - not the product got out again, but the whole brand - Samsung. <br><br>  7 - PS4, 8 - iPad Mini, 9 - Computer and TV speakers (hi, PS4 and FullHD-TVs!), On the tenth place is the Apple brand. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#eb2429">year 2014</font> </h2><br>  Last year, the composition of the online-market turned upside down.  Buyers were filled with specific devices, and they began to choose devices according to the principle ‚Äúwhat else does this brand have‚Äù. <br><br>  In the first place on the requests was Samsung technology.  With a small margin from the leader, Sony occupied the second position: the fans are no less loyal to the brand than Apple lovers.  The third place was taken by Lenovo - for the first time on the list, the brand immediately took off to third place: reasonable prices, aggressive expansion, nice laptops, long-lived smartphones - naturally, buyers became interested in, ‚Äúwhat else does the Chinese giant produce?‚Äù <br><br>  Surprisingly, in fourth place was the manufacturer of gaming peripherals - the company Razer.  In principle, players just like when everything that surrounds them - from one producer, in the same style, about the same level in quality and ease of management, but to win fourth place for the year ... That's really, they know how to get into Razer heart and soul!  :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e73/3fd/d5b/e733fdd5b3784ab69c92e05fac5a29a1.jpg"><br><br>  Surprised that the iPad is missing from the rating?  Surprise even more when you learn that in 2014 he, as a separate product, did not even enter the TOP-20.  Nevertheless, in the fifth place was the technology under the Apple brand, among which, of course, can be attributed, and tablets.  Unfortunately, inhuman-high prices in the second half of the year could not help but affect the bet: buy one of the best smartphones for 30 or 40 thousand rubles wherever it went, but for 50-60 - inevitably think about your own sanity. <br><br>  In the sixth place - again the column, the third year in a row from the TOP-10 do not fall out and the scales, ranked seventh.  Apparently, every customer has high hopes for them, as well as subscriptions to a fitness club. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/89a/04c/2f6/89a04c2f66524d50b93662864d4e9b84.jpg"><br><br>  Smart watches and fitness trackers are in eighth place: on the one hand, this is the trend of 2014 as a whole, on the other hand, the high price and questionable usefulness for one and all restrain the growth of this category.  We think that in 2015 (if something unpleasant does not happen again with prices) this category is expected to grow steadily, especially with the release of Apple Watch in the spring. <br><br>  The brand Canon took the ninth place, and on the tenth there was a new ‚Äúkitchen‚Äù interest: waffle iron.  Just as with multivarcs, we think that next year this category of goods will experience both sales growth and active promotion. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#eb2429">Trends</font> </h2><br>  The presence or absence of a product in the TOP does not mean that the demand for it has fallen dramatically.  Firstly, this sample was compiled exclusively at our online store, although in general it may reflect general market trends.  In the segment of young and actively using the network of customers, a kind of saturation has occurred, because of this, the demand in certain areas has decreased. <br><br>  Secondly, steel makers are more actively promoting the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãan ‚Äúecosystem‚Äù in which all devices of the same brand can interact with each other - previously this was peculiar only to Apple, but now other manufacturers are trying to follow the same path.  From this in the search sample of 2014 there are so many brands and so few specific products. <br><br>  And thirdly, not the most pleasant financial situation led to the fact that at the end of the year the demand for expensive equipment first experienced an explosive growth (people were afraid of further price increases), and then began to decline: stocks spent, prices went up, bought for 50 thousand the fact that only half a year ago there were significantly less cost very few people wanted, especially if the product was in the ‚Äúwant‚Äù category, and not ‚Äúnecessary‚Äù.  So this year we can see in our selection much more B-brands than before. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ae6/26a/6b9/ae626a6b9b8a4d6fb553ff3c3f025e49.png"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">I have an investor with my mother</font></i> <br><br>  Thanks for attention <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fa7/d16/199/fa7d16199fca4fee89c0b96fa9919513.png"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/376557/">https://habr.com/ru/post/376557/</a></p>
