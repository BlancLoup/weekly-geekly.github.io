    <h2>  Large IT companies: simplicity and performance </h2><br>  IDataLabs analysts have been collecting data on how many companies use Python for more than two years.  As a result, <a href="https://idatalabs.com/tech/products/python">they found</a> that 75 thousand companies around the world write in this language.  And although, according to their data, Python does not have the largest market share, its popularity is steadily increasing. <br><br>  Last year, Python ranked fifth in the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2598%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2581_TIOBE">TIOBE</a> ranking.  This is an index that measures the popularity of PL, based on the number of search queries on Google, Wikipedia, YouTube, Amazon, and others. <a href="https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/">ranking</a> . <br><br>  Among the large organizations that began to use Python precisely because of its simplicity and popularity, we can <a href="https://www.cleveroad.com/blog/discover-5-leading-companies-that-use-python-and-learn-does-it-fit-your-project">distinguish</a> Instagram.  As <a href="https://thenewstack.io/instagram-makes-smooth-move-python-3/">representatives of the company noted</a> , they switched to Python 3 and the Django framework due to the fact that this YaP is ‚Äúfriendly‚Äù to developers and allows them to concentrate on creating important functions for users. <br><br>  Plus, the prevalence of the language and the global community (according to SO, 39% of developers <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018">write</a> on it, and 68% <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018">call</a> Python their favorite programmer) they can quickly hire new team members. <br><br>  Another <a href="https://www.cleveroad.com/blog/discover-5-leading-companies-that-use-python-and-learn-does-it-fit-your-project">case</a> is SurveyMonkey, a company that develops cloud-based online survey software.  Every day, the organization processes about millions of respondents.  The original SurveyMonkey web application was written in C # using the .NET platform.  The application worked without failures, however, it showed not the best performance during testing and development of new features. <br><br>  In SurveyMonkey, they decided to rewrite the application in Python and split the main functions into several services, each of which ‚Äúcommunicated‚Äù with the rest through the API.  This reduced the code base with which it was necessary to work when testing functions, and simplified the process of their implementation. <br><br>  In addition to simplicity, among the advantages of Python, developers from SurveyMonkey note convenient <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonTestingToolsTaxonomy">tools for testing</a> and deploying applications and a large number of libraries. <br><br>  In Python, they <a href="https://realpython.com/world-class-companies-using-python/">write</a> to Google, Facebook, Netflix, Quora, Reddit, and <a href="https://www.quora.com/Which-companies-are-using-the-Python-language">many other large companies</a> .  In this case, Python is used not only by developers, but also by specialists in data processing and analysis. <br><br>  According to the July <a href="https://www.burtchworks.com/2018/07/16/2018-sas-r-or-python-survey-results-which-do-data-scientists-analytics-pros-prefer/">survey</a> from Burtch Works, where data analysts are engaged in the selection, Python and R are in second place in popularity: they are used by a third of the 1,200 experts surveyed.  At the same time, SAS-Python was only one percent behind the survey leader.  And according <a href="https://www.kdnuggets.com/2018/05/poll-tools-analytics-data-science-machine-learning-results.html/2">to</a> the Kdnuggets analytical platform, over the past year, 66% of the 2,300 data scientists surveyed used Python in work projects.  Moreover, the popularity of the language increased by 14% from 2016 to 2018. <br><br>  For example, as <a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-do-data-scientists-prefer-Python/answer/Abhishek-Ghose">noted by</a> Abhishek Ghose from [24] 7.ai, a client software development company, he uses Python to collect and process data from various formats.  According to Ghosh, it simplifies and speeds up the process of writing code.  At the same time, the specialist notes that to solve some of the data science problems, it is enough for him to use the Python shell. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/n6/da/qu/n6daquwigpjqy81hcmbalchpo4g.jpeg"><br>  <font color="#A9A9A9"><i>/ photo <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tambako/8651113869/">Tambako The Jaguar</a> <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/2.0/">CC</a></i></font> <br><br><h2>  Startups: minimum resources to launch a project </h2><br>  Unlike big business, most startups do not have a strong start-up capital, and time is a critical factor for start-up companies.  It is important for them to create a working solution as soon as possible in order to present it to investors.  Python also allows you to speed up development, spending a minimum of resources.  The language allows a team of two or three people to create a working prototype for a couple of months.  Under <a href="https://stxnext.com/blog/2018/04/03/why-python-should-be-programming-language-your-startup/">this scheme,</a> in 2013, they <a href="https://blog.ycombinator.com/the-most-important-decision-is-getting-started-laura-behrens-wu/">started</a> at Shippo, a company engaged in the supply of goods for businesses. <br><br>  This language feature helped Drew Houston in his time when he <a href="https://opensource.com/business/13/12/why-python-perfect-startups">began work</a> on Dropbox.  As a student, he constantly forgot the flash drive at home.  Having decided to solve this problem, Drew quickly created a cloud storage prototype and closed a deal with investors. <br><br>  Another example: Nikita Sobolev, the developer and founder of the startup Wemake.services, <a href="https://vc.ru/37415-zachem-izuchat-python">transferred</a> his entire team from Java to Python.  Among the reasons for this decision, he calls the speed of development.  According to him, the performance of a programmer who writes in Python is several times higher than, for example, that of a person who writes in Java. <br><br>  Programmers with knowledge of Python are very much in demand.  According to <a href="https://www.hntrends.com/2018/jul-top-ten-programming-languages.html">Hacker News statistics for July 2018</a> , this PL is the second most popular after React: 24% of all posts on the resource are devoted to searching for Python-developers for startups.  At the same time, this PL has been holding positions for several years. <br><br>  And there is reason to believe that in the future Python will only gain popularity. <br><br><hr><br>  <i>PS Fresh materials from our corporate blog:</i> <i><br><br></i> <ul><li>  <a href="https://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/seti/raspredelennyj-brandmauer-v-vcloud-director-8-20-osobennosti-resheniya/">Distributed firewall in vCloud Director 8.20: solution features</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/funkcionalnost/chto_skryvaetsa_za_terminom_vcloud_director_vzglyad_isnutri/">What is behind the term vCloud Director - an inside view</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/zhelezo/servery-dlya-sap-osnovnye-platformy/">Servers for SAP: Basic Platforms</a> </li></ul><br><hr><br>  <i>The main direction of our activity is the provision of cloud services:</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i><a href="https://www.it-grad.ru/services/iaas/iaas-vmware-virtual-infrastructure/">Virtual Infrastructure (IaaS)</a> |</i>  <i><a href="https://www.it-grad.ru/services/iaas/pci-dss/">PCI DSS Hosting</a> |</i>  <i><a href="https://www.it-grad.ru/services/iaas/fz-152/">Cloud FZ-152</a> |</i>  <i><a href="https://www.it-grad.ru/services/1c/">Rent 1C in the cloud</a></i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/418909/">https://habr.com/ru/post/418909/</a></p>
