  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Interesting economics or manipulating numbers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently, 2 topics skipped: about the fact that <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/popular_science/83272/">eating in restaurants is cheaper</a> and about the fact that <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/popular_science/83327/">your car is more expensive</a> . <br>  Now, using simple calculations as an example, we decide the opposite ‚Äî I will not write much.  I just remember the things that the authors of the above posts, due to ignorance, unconsciousness or malicious intent, have forgotten to announce. <br>  Let's start the same. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The author of the <b>first post is</b> indignant that he will have to spend his time buying and cooking. <br>  However, this action can be entrusted to one's half - as observed, people rarely live alone, usually with their parents and then with a girl / wife.  We will not consider the case of parents, the case of a girlfriend / wife is also obvious: the cost of products is clearly less than the cost of their products prepared in a restaurant. <br>  On the example of <b>pizza</b> : the cost of products 50r, and ready-made <u>big</u> pizza costs 300. <br>  Or on the example of <b>cheese soup with shrimps</b> : 6 servings cost 150 rubles, while in a restaurant, 6 servings will cost per thousand. <br>  I did not specifically count the cost of everyday food such as chicken or fried potato soups - the gap there is much larger. <br>  <b>What were the mistakes of the</b> author of the topic (subjectively, of course)? <br>  1) He considers the cost of a relatively extremely narrow stratum of people who live separately from their parents, but do not have the second half. <br>  2) He considers the cost of cooking and buying as part of the cost of the goods.  Taking into account the first point, this is absolutely wrong; if it is not taken into account, it is strongly overstated. <br><br>  <b>Auto</b> <br>  Let's look at the average taxi.  Sometimes there are budget Hindai-type foreign cars, sometimes even classics (and if you take a province, then only classics). <br>  Average cars to used (think your taxi off the assembly line) Nexia.  And throw on the repair thirty, repair after purchase immediately =) Total &lt;200tr. <br>  The author clearly raised the price, this is far from the middle class =) <br>  With the cost of gasoline in 20t.r.  In principle, we can agree. <br>  We will not consider parking, this is unnecessary: ‚Äã‚Äãif an icicle falls, then money can easily be cut from the wagon (see court practice).  A gangster 90s long past. <br>  And we believe that the car for 5 years.  After which it will be sold for 50% of the sales price (taking into account possible accidents and depreciation of the car). <br>  Costs: 200/5 years (purchase with repairs) + 20 (gasoline) + 10 (minor repairs) - 100/5 (sale) +3 (insurance) = 53t.r.  in year. <br>  We consider a taxi: 4 times a day (2 times there / back a day on average) for 150 rubles - already clearly for 200t.r.  In Moscow, even more expensive. <br>  Conclusion? <br>  And even if you use public transport, it will not be cheaper.  Considering the fare for 15-20 rubles for 2 people 2 times in both directions we get the same 50t.r. <br>  After buying a car, my family budget has become a little freer.  I felt it in my own skin.  This is not to mention the fact that you can now go <b>at any time and in any place</b> . <br>  <b>What were the mistakes of the</b> author of the topic (again subjectively)? <br>  1) Extremely high prices for cars.  Taxis are not like =) <br>  2) CASCO for the new expensive cars.  Delete or take on our second-hand cheap. <br>  3) Parking. <br>  4) The cost of a taxi.  When calculating, I took less, but I took into account that I would have to travel more than 1 time there / back. </div>
