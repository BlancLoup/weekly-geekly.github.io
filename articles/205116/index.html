    <ul><li>  Organize automated acceptance of payments on your website using the most popular electronic payment systems, Internet banking, terminals, mobile payments, payment using VISA / MasterCard, etc. </li><li>  Organize the work of your employees using the built-in task manager (distribution of tasks among employees and control of execution) </li><li>  To carry out email-mailing to customers of your online store with a high percentage of email deliverability (send commercial offers, inform about ongoing sales, promotions, etc.) </li><li>  Automate the processing of incoming requests from customers (ring out unpaid bills, conduct surveys, collect feedback on purchased goods, etc.) </li><li>  Evaluate the effectiveness of advertising channels used and conduct SPLIT testing of new marketing techniques </li><li>  Get comprehensive statistics on the performance of your online business with an indication of all kinds of cuts. </li><li>  Keep a simple record of expenses related to the business. </li></ul><br>  This list of opportunities is incomplete, but it allows you to generally understand why AvtoOffice was created and how it can be used in your business. <br><br><h4>  Quick sales start for your business </h4><br>  A feature of AvtoOffice is that to set up the connection of all the functions described above to your site, you do not need to hire a programmer or code something yourself, i.e.  the service is designed in such a way that its capabilities are available not only to programmers or businessmen who have their own programmers on staff, but also to those who do not know anything about the technical side of Internet sales. <br><br>  At the moment, with the help of AutoOffice for automated payment acceptance, you can connect the following payment options to your site: <br><br><ul><li>  Payment system Yandex.Money </li><li>  Payment system Interkassa </li><li>  Z-payment payment system </li><li>  WebMoney payment system </li><li>  Payment system RBK Money </li><li>  PayPal payment system </li><li>  Payment system QIWI </li><li>  Payment system ROBOKASSA </li><li>  For legal entities - Invoicing the client with the details of the legal entity </li><li>  Payment through a bank - Formation of a form PD-4 for a user of a payment order </li><li>  C.O.D </li></ul><br>  All these methods of accepting payments are connected without programming, digging into technical documentation and picking API payment systems.  All connection is reduced to registration in the payment system and specifying the interaction settings between the selected payment system and your store registered in Avtooffice. <br><br>  The process of specifying a connection is described in as much detail as possible in step-by-step instructions that any person who has managed to get a mailbox in any mail service can understand.  Those.  when you start an online business using AvtoOffice, you will need to spend a minimum of time and effort on mastering the technical side, because  Most of the typical problems have already been solved. <br><br>  For example, in order to start selling online, you will need: <br><ol><li>  Create a website with a description of your product or service in any way convenient for you: WordPress, Joomla, HTML-page, etc.  - if you are not a perfectionist, this procedure will take you no more than 1-2 days. </li><li>  Register your online store in Avtoofis - 2 minutes. </li><li>  Fill the store, registered in AvtoOffice, with goods (specify the name, price, short description) - 2 minutes. </li><li>  Connect at least one payment system to the store - 3 minutes. </li><li>  Place a button on the order of goods on your site - 3 minutes. </li></ol><br>  And then go head to marketing and mastering new channels of advertising! <br><br><h4>  If you want to sell software or services </h4><br>  One of the features of the AvtoOffice service is the automatic sending to the client after payment of special materials, such as download links for software products, data for access to closed sections of the site, PIN codes for activation of software products or access keys to online resources.  If you trade in these types of goods, then AvtoOffice not only fully automates the process of placing an order and accepting payments, but also automatically sends your goods to your customers after receiving money to your account. <br><br>  In the case of trade in goods of intellectual labor (programs, 1C training, access keys, PIN codes, etc.), the client will receive the paid goods almost instantly and be able to start using it. <br><br>  In addition, if you release any update of your program or create a paid add-on or module, you can always use AvtoOffice to notify your customers about it.  In the service there is the possibility of sending information letters on your client base with high deliverability and fixation of guaranteed open letters.  (How this problem is technically solved, perhaps, I will tell in the following posts). <br><br>  You can read more about AvtoOffice and try it in business here: <a href="https://autokassir.ru/%3Fr%3Dacs%26id%3D33%26lg%3Dru">https://autoweboffice.com/</a> <br><br>  If you have questions about the service AvtoOfis, then ask them in the comments, I will try to answer. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/205116/">https://habr.com/ru/post/205116/</a></p>
