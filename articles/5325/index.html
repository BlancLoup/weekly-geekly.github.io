Here are the main key points that should be covered in a truly hit article on Apple: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Mention Microsoft <br><br>  ... and even more than that - splash into the text of Windows Vista with Bill Gates.  Speak about Apple's successes and Microsoft's problems (or vice versa, add something about the latest Redmond achievements against the background of overlays in Cupertino).  Even if all this has absolutely nothing to do with the topic of the article, still insert at least a mention of Microsoft somewhere in the middle of your text. <br><br>  Report fresh rumor

      What, there is nothing in mind?  So come up with yourself!  Not sure how to write rumors?  It's simple: remember the market for some consumer electronics, in which Apple is not represented at all, and write that in Cupertino they plan to move in that direction.  A specific example: ‚ÄúApple is trying its hand at the food processor market!‚Äù Alternatively, take a couple of popular gadgets at random and write that Apple is going to release a hybrid device called iDevice based on them (the indispensable lower-case ‚Äúi‚Äù will add credibility to your ravings).  Then you can safely move on to the next item - <br><br>  Upcoming Apple Conference <br><br>  ... and tie her up with the ear just laid out.  Again, a concrete example: "One of the most awaited WWDC will surely be the revolutionary iCrowave - a microwave oven running the Apple iPod." <br><br>  Don't forget about Apple's market share. <br><br>  Here, too, will not prevent a couple of loud statements.  To do this, we need some current statistics with its subsequent extrapolation - for example, we find out the growth rate and calculate what Apple's share in the market will be in a hundred years.  Then, with a clear conscience, you can make a sensational headline in the title. ‚ÄúAnalysts predict an increase in the market share of Apple Inc.  up to 87%. "  The fact that even in an ideal scenario, this will happen not earlier than in 2109, we will modestly keep silent. <br><br>  Lawsuits <br><br>  Without them - as without bread.  Potential lawsuits, rumors of lawsuits, court hearings about the next lawsuit and so on and so forth - everyone is interested to know who is trying to sue someone.  In general, on the legal front, Apple appears in two typical situations: either lawyers from Cupertino run into any small pawn, or some large corporations make their claims to Apple, and then Apple itself turns into a pawn. <br><br>  New processors <br><br>  You write about the new Dell XPS with the Intel Dual Core double-espresso core six quattro chip, and everyone boldly swallows such nonsense.  We take a breath, write the same thing about Macs and suddenly find links to our own text in Digg, Slashdot and the spread of the New York Times. <br><br>  "And now ... iPhone!" <br><br>  Until recently, it was enough to mention in the text of the iPod, so that the whole article breathes a real sensation.  Now, the iPhone has replaced iPod: tie this magic word with another lawsuit, a fresh ear and further on the list (see above) - and you are in queens. <br><br>  Love for apple <br><br>  This part of your text will be a solid hyperbole (save the arguments for the future) - just tell us how comfortable, beautiful and unsurpassed the new Apple product will be.  The fact that you have never seen this novelty live can be easily disguised by extensive quoting of "insiders" and "leading experts." <br><br>  Apple Hate <br><br>  After a beautifully stated declaration of love for Cupertino, the impressive traffic on the site is provided to you, but if you want to really stir up readers, write a material called ‚ÄúI hate Apple‚Äù.  Even the mildest criticism will work - the line ‚ÄúI like absolutely everything in Apple products, not counting one annoying Mac OS X settings panel‚Äù will instantly localize thousands of hot supporters of the Preference Pane you dislike.  Learn a lot of interesting things. <br><br>  ... After all of the above, readers may have a natural question - ‚Äúwhy did you, dear, still not write your own mega-article‚Äù?  To be honest, I myself am surprised at this - however, I am amuse myself with the hope that this text will become such a mega article.  And, of course, I really want to know what the title of the Most Popular Apple Article will look like.  My version - <br><br>  ‚ÄúRumor of the day: Bill Gates is going to file a lawsuit against defective iPhone Quad Duo after doubling the share of these devices on the market.‚Äù <br><br>  Author: Devanshu Mehta (http://www.applematters.com/index.php/section/comments/how-to-write-the-most-popular-apple-article-ever/) <br>  Translation: Andrei Bessemer (http://www.mactime.ru/Environ/WebObjects/mactime.woa/wa/Main?textid=7011&amp;level1=mactimes) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/5325/">https://habr.com/ru/post/5325/</a></p>
