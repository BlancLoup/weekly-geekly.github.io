  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Online shopping 11.11 as a reason for dating</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  New holidays appear on the calendars, sometimes unexpectedly.  And not everyone still knows that November 11th is the world day of shopping, which arose from the light hand of Chinese marketers.  Why this particular day?  The fact is that 11.11 in China marks the day of the bachelor (single, one person).  For several years on this day, online and offline stores have been doing big sales, handing out coupons and writing discounts.  Good Chinese tradition, which combined Black Friday and Cyber ‚Äã‚ÄãMonday, quickly <s>overcame the Chinese firewall</s> caught on around the world - who would refuse thousands of products at prices from a few cents.  We are proud to be part of this tradition. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b47/687/bc4/b47687bc458a8ea3258b366afc113104.png" width="500"></div><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <font color="#c30023">Who are we?</font> </h2><br>  Hi, Geektimes!  We are already familiar with you in absentia, it's time to meet in person.  <a href="http://en.jd.com/ru/%3Fkey%3D10.8"><b>JD.com</b></a> is China's largest online store, ranking second among the top B2C e-commerce players.  Globally, the company is named the fourth largest e-commerce company.  Since May 2014, the company's shares have been listed on the NASDAQ trading floor.  JD.com, being the largest online retailer of China, has experience in creating 123 own warehouses and 3210 centers for issuing orders.  For the international market, the online retailer has the address en.jd.com and for Russia, in particular, JD.ru.  The version created for the Russian market fully provides service for Russian buyers. <br><br>  The main difference between JD.com and other Chinese online stores is the presence of a special, unparalleled JD Collection brand zone.  In the JDCollection category there are only original products from brand manufacturers, which guarantee the buyer high quality, reasonable price level, one-year warranty service and the ability to return the goods within 30 days after purchase.  We appreciate your time and therefore are quick enough: even during sales we try to deliver the goods within 7 days.

      Our arrival in Russia was noisy, interesting and ambiguous.  The call has been accepted.  Today we see that many buyers love JD.com for good prices, accurate and fast delivery.  And finally, having solved all the issues with coupons, we give the start to our very first 11.11 sale in Russia.  We have something to say to the Russian-speaking IT community.  In particular, we will be happy to talk about the features of Chinese retail, problems and solutions that arise when sending packages, tell you about new brands and gadgets that Russians already love: gadgets, low cost action cameras, quadcopters and numerous electronic toys. <br><br>  We still have time to discuss all these topics, but for now the main thing for today is the grand sale 11.11. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#c30023">SALE on JD.com</font> </h2><br>  The online store JD.com presents a huge number of items - from consumer goods and knick-knacks to serious gadgets of local and global brands.  That is why we have decided to hold a sale so as to reach the maximum audience with any requests and interests.  To do this, we have developed a coupon system with which the buyer can make purchases at a discount of up to 40% or purchase goods for only 5 cents, depending on the type of promotion, and also purchase goods in the category of special offers at a discount of up to 80%. <br><br>  We know a lot about Chinese brands that are ready to answer almost any global technical innovation.  Therefore, for us one of the goals of the ‚Äú11.11‚Äù sale is closer acquaintance of the Russian consumer with the largest international brands.  Xiaomi, Nubia, Wileyfox, ZUK, Oneplus, Zopo - these brands are already well known to Russian geeks and have earned their trust.  In flash sales, for example, leading models of smartphones already familiar to many, such as Wileyfox Storm, Nubia Z9 Maxi, Oneplus One, Meizu M2 Note, were presented. <br><br>  The start of the ‚Äú11.11‚Äù sale of 2015 proved that JD.com‚Äôs efforts to conquer Russian consumers were not in vain.  Our thoughts are confirmed by the most recent statistics collected.  Judge for yourself: official sales within the framework of the ‚ÄúBachelor's Day‚Äù campaign started on JD Global ( <a href="http://en.jd.com/">en.jd.com</a> and <a href="http://www.jd.ru/">jd.ru</a> ) on November 9 at 10:00 Moscow time, and already on November 10 at 10:00 in the morning a fixed number of orders from several dozens of countries reached 300,000. Russia is the first overseas market to which JD.com officially entered, launching a separate russified Internet platform JD.ru.  And in the first two days of large-scale sales for the ‚ÄúDay of the Bachelors‚Äù about 80% of orders placed fell on Russia and the CIS.  Smartphones and electronics account for more than 50% of the total number of orders. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#c30023">About the main thing - about coupons!</font> </h2><br>  If you have not registered on the site, immediately proceed!  At the moment, 2 types of discount coupons are available for users registered with JD.ru: <br><br><ul><li>  Coupon <b>JD555</b> gives you the opportunity to purchase products from a list of 20,000 items for just 5 cents.  The coupon is valid for the entire promotion period. <br><br></li><li>  Coupon <b>JD777</b> offers a discount of $ 10- $ 20 dollars for special offers from famous Chinese brands.  It is also valid on all sales days. </li></ul><br>  The third coupon, <b>JD111</b> , gave a discount on lots that participated in flash sales on the first day of the promotion.  At the moment this coupon is valid as a discount ($ 20 for orders for $ 50, $ 40 for orders for $ 100 and $ 60 for orders for $ 150). <br><br>  To get a discount, simply enter the coupon code in a special field when placing an order, including the names of the goods to which the promotional code applies.  By the way, when registering, an invitation code will be sent to your email.  if you send it to a friend or acquaintance, each of you will receive $ 10. <br><br>  Looking ahead, we answer the expected question in the comments - there should be no technical problems with coupons, they work without complaints for at least 2 days.  Therefore, we are waiting for you with coupons on <a href="http://www.jd.ru/act/singles_day.html">the sales page</a> .  The festival of discounts, dedicated to the day of the bachelor and a beautiful date 11.11, is already in full swing! <br><br><h2>  <font color="#c30023">MiniFAQ</font> </h2><br>  It is possible that rumors about the alleged problems of our project, carefully replicated by the titular Russian media, have reached you.  We consider it necessary to write about it in the official blog. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Recently read that your discount coupons do not work ...?</b> <div class="spoiler_text"> At the end of October, we really had technical problems with the mechanism for issuing and activating coupons, we made maximum efforts and solved the problem within a few days.  Coupons were returned to all bona fide purchasers under the same conditions, the action was resumed on October 27, 2 weeks passed and timed for sales 11.11, no problems arise.  So, it is better to see once than to hear 100 times. </div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Recently I read that your customer data was stolen and publicly available ...?</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  User data leaks have occurred at many Internet companies, including the largest and most famous.  Unlike these examples, we have not had leakage of critical data (neither passport data, nor e-mails, nor data of plastic cards).  In addition, our team did everything possible and impossible, and managed to stop publishing 95% of all sources within 8 hours after the leak. </div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Recently read that the information on payment for goods goes to someone's mail</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  This is not so :) In fact, this is an art director's post that guided the process of creating a custom mailing list.  His mail was used in the layout as a sample.  No letters "on the side" did not go away. </div></div><br>  In just a few days, we want to sell 20,000 products at a price of 5 cents and tens of thousands more at equally attractive prices.  We plan to deliver all this in 7 days.  Simply put - we are ready.  Are you with us? <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/eb9/7bb/995/eb97bb995efbe87ff3eb51d11c58b6ef.jpg"></div><br>  Enjoy the shopping! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/368947/">https://habr.com/ru/post/368947/</a></p>
