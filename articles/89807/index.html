They already know that <br><br>  1. There should be a lot of texts on the site. <br>  2. The number of these texts should increase regularly and, preferably, according to the plan developed, and not anyhow. <br>  3. Texts must be unique <br>  4. And finally, the texts should be interesting and informatively valuable for the targeted site visitors. <br><br>  With the first three postulates everything seems to be clear.  The more texts on the site, the higher the effect of promotion on low-frequency inquiries, and the greater the likelihood that the site‚Äôs representatives will often come across to the representatives of their target audience in the top ten search engines.

      But with the fourth postulate - not so all and unambiguously.  Do people read articles posted on websites, or order informationally useful, and, therefore, not cheap texts - waste money in vain?  Maybe there really are enough articles written without grammatical errors, so long as they contain <a name="habracut"></a>  were keywords present? <br><br>  So read or not?  The question is really non-trivial. <br>  The need for texts convincing webmasters is not necessary.  But after all, they do not need the texts in order to have something to read themselves, but, first and foremost, to solve the tasks before them.  And then an interesting situation arises - a customer who is tempted to promote his site higher in the SERP has to be told why we need these very texts. <br>  On the technical side, there are explanations.  Even to the Customer who is not familiar with the technologies of optimization and website promotion, it is easy to justify the need for texts.  But with regard to their quality characteristics, everything is much more complicated. <br>  It seems intuitively understandable - the more interesting the text, the better.  However, the material side of the issue is a significant barrier. <br>  If the text as an object for reading is not claimed, then why not spend money on it? <br>  As they say, if there is no difference, then why pay more? <br><br>  It can be said unequivocally - people read articles posted on sites. <br>  But this should be said with one essential caveat - people read not just texts, but only a wealth of information that is useful to them, which helps them in solving certain tasks.  In order to leave no doubt about it, it remains to consider why they not only read, but also want to see useful texts for themselves. <br><br>  To begin with, it is necessary to make a reservation - we are now talking about corporate sites offering a particular product and its delivery offline, although the following are quite true for social resources. <br><br>  The target audience of corporate sites is different.  It can be both business potential buyers (representatives of the Company), and individuals - the final consumers of the product.  But with this difference, they also have in common - they all visit the site not for the sake of entertainment, but in order to satisfy their need for something. <br><br>  This, in turn, means that all these people are already prepared for the perception of information initially.  Moreover, they want to get it.  At the same time, the less aware a person is in the peculiarities of the proposed product, the more he is ready to consume the information offered to him.  If an ambiguous attitude to the product or a negative image has been formed, but there is a need for it, however, the site visitor will surely read the article proposed to him. <br><br>  Such potential willingness of the audience to assimilate the materials offered to it is especially beneficial for those companies that have yet reached the brand level.  Brand in its understanding, when the confidence in the product and its supplier is so great that a company-brand can afford to abandon targeted sales to Clients belonging to certain segments of its target audience or postpone such sales. <br><br>  The company ‚Äúwhile-not-brand‚Äù can conquer its Clients with the help of texts.  And that's why. <br><br>  Aristotle, the author, who does not need a special presentation, noted in his ‚ÄúRhetoric‚Äù a valuable moment for us: <br>  ‚ÄúVerbal beliefs are of three kinds.  The first type depends on the personality of the speaker;  the second is to create a certain mood among the audience, the third - as evidence or visible evidence, is contained in the words of the speech itself ‚Äù. <br><br>  In social psychology, there is one interesting pattern established - the higher the personal interest of people in a particular information, the more convincing is their well-cited argument, than the opinion of a particular personality expert. <br><br>  It turns out that when a topic is directly related to a person, then he draws attention, and he listens primarily to arguments, and the personality and status of the source of the message recede into the background.  Consequently, the text that contains the arguments, he will read.  And the higher the quality of both the argument itself and the article as a whole, the greater the likelihood of converting the target site visitor into the Client. <br><br>  This is especially true for visitors to those sites that are focused on the B2B segment.  Texts that are useful for potential Clients and consumers can be turned into real buyers by the part of them that looks at the site, since these visitors are already motivated to receive information and its perception.  Why?  Suffice it to recall who visits such resources.  These are the so-called ‚Äúbusiness buyers‚Äù, already by definition absolutely far from making spontaneous decisions.  These people will carefully select different options, compare and compare the data and generally do many other ‚Äúboring‚Äù things that they may not do when they buy something for themselves. <br><br>  Responsibility for a business or an elementary fear of losing a job forces people from business to study the market for the product of interest in great detail.  Is it possible to say with confidence that this work is a pleasure and joy?  Maybe.  But be that as it may, those who facilitate it will win extra points already at the stage of selecting options.  Should I give this a head start to their competitors? <br><br>  Of course, texts that add winning points to the site owner and form preliminary loyalty should not only be informationally valuable to the visitor, but unique in essence. This, in turn, means that the creation of such texts should begin with studying the information on competitors' sites.  Articles for the site being promoted should be at least as good.  But in any case, the information should be submitted from a new angle and have its own "twist", which, not only can, but must manifest itself as a presentation of the material. <br>  And, of course, any text intended for site visitors should sell.  And often to sell in such a way that only the owner of the resource, the one who promotes it on the Web and the one who writes this text know that the article is selling. <br><br>  Why I decided to write this article ... <br>  Those who promote websites ‚Äúin a white way‚Äù, and I cooperate with such representatives of the adjacent workshop, know perfectly well that a significant and often the lion‚Äôs share of the costs of promotion is occupied by texts. <br>  And when creating a site, if its functional purpose is to sell, the content plays a tangible role.  How many customers take the texts for their resources seriously?  Someone - yes, but they only need this article in order to once again be convinced that they are right and finally dispel doubts about the fairness of the investments made.  And someone seriously believes that for 10-15 thousand rubles, you can get a great corporate website "turnkey".  And in fact receive.  Turnkey, with the texts bought on the cheap.  And then they are outraged that the returns from their site are zero, although it is in the TOP. <br>  It is quite clear that it is often much simpler not to explain anything to the Customer who ‚Äústudied‚Äù the market and who knows best how much ‚Äúnow the sites‚Äù.  There is no pity.  At their service are dozens of content exchanges and the hands (not the brains) of thousands of ‚Äúspecialists‚Äù. <br><br>  But there are others - those who are willing to pay for high-quality websites that are able to perform their tasks.  And such Customers just want to know - do they have to spend extra money. <br>  These Customers very often have to answer the question posed in this article.  It is not difficult to answer it if he himself is convinced of the need for "correct" texts.  And if not, if you yourself doubt it or just the right words are not found?  Then the whole process of negotiations "floats". <br>  Some of my Clients decided this question simply - they say to their Customer: ‚ÄúHere is a copywriter's contact for you, agree on your own.‚Äù  And in this case, explaining why it is harmful to neglect the content side of texts is my task. <br>  However, this is not always possible. <br><br>  I hope that what I wrote will help those of you who no, no, no, and are forced to answer the Customer a ‚Äúchildish‚Äù question - do people really read articles on websites? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/89807/">https://habr.com/ru/post/89807/</a></p>
