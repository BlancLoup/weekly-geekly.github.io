  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Linux accounting and reporting</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The article deals with the actual issue of accounting and submission of electronic reporting to the regulatory authorities in the GNU / Linux operating system. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Baseline conditions </h4><br>  A few months ago, I was faced with the goal of finally transferring all the computers in the organization to Linux.  Most of the employees in the organization have long been working on computers on which Linux is installed and use Free Software (OSS) in their daily activities.  The only department that was not affected by the progress was accounting. <br><br>  To transfer accounting to Linux, it was necessary to solve two main tasks: <br><ol><li>  What is accounting for in Linux; </li><li>  How to send reports to regulatory authorities. </li></ol><br><h4>  Electronic reporting </h4><br>  If everything is more or less clear with the accounting records, then reporting on Linux is not a trivial task. <br><br>  <i>Submission of reports in electronic form is carried out via telecommunication channels of communication (TKS) with the use of enhanced qualified electronic signature through electronic document flow operators.</i>  [one]

      The first problem is that none of the <i>operators of electronic document management</i> , or as they are called the <i>special communication operators</i> (SOS), does not provide ready-made solutions for Linux. <br><br>  The second problem is the <i>enhanced qualified electronic signature</i> (CEP).  To work with it requires the presence of an established <i>means of cryptographic information protection</i> (ICPT), certified by the FSB. <br><br>  Strangely enough, but such SKZI under Linux exist.  Most of the special communications operators use CryptoPro CPSP, which is available for all major operating systems. <br><br><h4>  Market Review </h4><br>  The website of the Federal Tax Service of the Russian Federation contains a list of Organizations - Operators of Electronic Document Circulation [3].  Currently it contains 98 organizations. <br><br>  Some of the represented companies are partners of the four leading companies in the market: Tenzor, Takskom, PF SKB Kontur CJSC, and Kaluga Astral CJSC.  Other companies provide their services only in certain regions. <br><br>  According to the data of the Social Insurance Fund (FSS), the distribution of clients between SOS for 2013 is as follows [4]: <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8e8/4c4/e73/8e84c4e734996307f52776157f0746e9.png" alt="image" width="600"></div><br><br>  The company "Tenzor" offers the product "SBIS ++".  The program is implemented as a Windows application, supports work with several crypto-providers: CryptoPro CSP, Signal Com CSP, Lissi CSP, VipNet CSP.  [five] <br><br>  Taxcom offers two solutions: PC Sprinter and Online Sprinter.  The first is a Windows application, the second allows you to work with the system through the Internet Explorer browser.  Both solutions require the presence of CryptoPro CPSP.  [6] <br><br>  ZAO Kaluga Astral offers the product Astral Report, also made in the form of a Windows application.  CryptoPro is used as SKPI.  [7] <br><br>  CJSC PF SKB Kontur offers a variety of solutions.  Most of the company's products work using SaaS technology (software as a service) and is available via a browser (latest versions of IE, Chrome, Safari or Firefox). <br><br>  They also provide the so-called <i>cloud</i> - <i>based CEP</i> (CloudKEP). <br><br>  <i>Cloud electronic signature is a qualified electronic signature (CEP), which is stored on the server of a specialized telecom operator.</i>  <i>It can not be damaged or lost.</i>  <i>To confirm access to the cloud signature, you will need to enter a code from an SMS message (for example, when decrypting or signing documents).</i>  [eight] <br><br>  To work with such a CEP, specialized software is not required.  All operations of signing and decrypting reports occur directly on the SOS server. <br><br>  Main products of the company for reporting: <br><ul><li>  Contour.Extren - requires system-dependent components. </li></ul><br><br>  Products that do not require the installation of additional components: <br><ul><li>  Contour. Extern <a href="https://kontur.ru/kemb">Small Business</a> (CEMB) </li><li>  <a href="https://otchet.kontur.ru/">Report.ru</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.e-kontur.ru/">Kontur.Elba</a> - business accounting and reporting for entrepreneurs on the simplified taxation system and UTII without the participation of an accountant. </li><li>  <a href="http://www.b-kontur.ru/">Kontur. Accounting</a> - Accounting, payroll and reporting for accountants of small companies. </li></ul><br><h4>  Testing </h4><br>  It was decided to test the performance of the above products on Linux. <br><br>  Unfortunately, no reporting program, made in the form of a Windows application, was launched via Wine.  There is information that in WINE @ Etersoft 2.0 the possibility of launching SBiS ++ and CryptoPro is implemented, for more details follow the <a href="http://club.cnews.ru/blogs/entry/novyj_wineetersoft_2_0_sbis__i_kriptopro_v_linux">link</a> .  I have no opportunity to test the performance of this solution. <br><br>  "Online Sprinter" was tied to Internet Explore and CryptoPro. <br><br>  Products of the company ZAO PF SKB Kontur showed much better than themselves.  They turned out to be more convenient both in terms of testing and in terms of use.  Testing was facilitated by the availability of demo access and promotions for free use.  Also, their work does not require the installation of additional software when using the cloud-based CEP and they work fine in the main browsers (Firefox, Google Chrome, Chromium). <br><br><h5>  SKZI and CEP </h5><br>  Most of the SOS work with the CryptoPro CSP IMSP, some support the Signal Com CSP, Lissi CSP, VipNet CSP.  Only CryptoPro has a native version for Linux.  However, launching CryptoPro on Linux turned out to be not so easy and in the end it was not possible to ensure its correct operation. <br><br>  For this reason, we have abandoned the use of "iron" CEP.  For cloud-based CEPs, the installation of an IPMS is not required. <br><br><h4>  Results </h4><br>  After a month of testing, the choice was finally stopped at Kontur. Accounting, which allows not only to keep accounting records, but also to send reports to the regulatory authorities.  For the promotion we have three months of free work in the service.  And in the organization there is only one computer with Windows on board, the license so far allows, but we do not plan to extend it. <br><br>  Accountants are also very satisfied.  You can work on any computer.  The service is simple, understandable and contains many additional features: a regulatory framework, allows you to check counterparties, ask a question to experts, and many additional training materials. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/19c/767/588/19c76758813f483fbaf635290092e9f0.png" width="600"></div><br><br><h4>  Accounting in Linux and alternative 1C </h4><br>  For Linux, there are a number of accounting programs.  All of them are very peculiar and do not always keep pace with updates to Russian legislation.  The only serious and official decision for accounting in Linux is 1C. <br><br>  About the disadvantages of 1C is well written in the article <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/244727/">Why 1C is bad and why 1C programmers don‚Äôt like it so much</a> . <br><br>  Our choice in favor of Contour. Accounting identified the following factors: <br><ul><li>  Easy installation and configuration, or rather the lack thereof, Kontur. Accounting simply works; </li><li>  Cloud-based CEP is used to send reports; programs of other developers like CEP are not supported; </li><li>  Simplicity of the interface and use; </li><li>  Updates are free and installed automatically on servers; </li><li>  Cloud principle of work, without restrictions on the number of jobs; </li><li>  No need to have a freelance 1C programmer; </li><li>  Availability of related services; </li><li>  Large regulatory and training base. </li></ul><br><h4>  Is everything so cloudless in the clouds? </h4><br>  The company and its services left a pleasant impression.  We are very pleased with the step taken.  But there are certain limitations. <br><br>  First, nowhere on the company's resources I have not met the official confirmation of support for operating systems other than Windows.  License agreements also do not include operating systems other than Windows. <br><br>  Secondly, the company's products are not suitable for all organizations, it all depends on the tax regime and type of activity.  Before purchasing products you should carefully familiarize yourself with all the capabilities of the services. <br><br>  Thirdly, in a number of moments Kontur. Accounting is not a competitor 1C, which has a more flexible adjustment to individual needs. <br><br>  Therefore, before the final transition, it is necessary to carefully study the needs of accounting and functional services, the benefit is the ability to do this without any risk.  The first 30 days of using Contour. Accounting is provided free of charge.  There is also an action ‚ÄúA gift for new LLCs‚Äù - a quarter of work in an online service with sending reports.  For Kontur.Elby, the action ‚ÄúYear of Elba for beginners IP‚Äù is valid - a year of free service at the Premium rate.  For Kontur. Extern Small Business there is a campaign "Test Drive" for 3 months. <br><br>  You can get acquainted with the work of Kontur.
