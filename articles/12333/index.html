  <section class="page js-page"><h1>iPod: programs for every day. Part II</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  ‚ÄúThe show is a master go he,‚Äù as the great Freddie Mercury sang.  Well, let's continue.  In the <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/blog/ipod/18387.html">first</a> part of the article, I quickly told about the most interesting programs that I felt and read about on the web.  Now it will be a matter of what I myself have used for a long time.  I will tell about my impressions, about all, in my opinion, the pros and cons of those or other programs.  These are a couple of video converters, a couple of plug-ins to iTunes and iTunes 7.3 itself, as well as a small utility for working with music. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I will begin, of course, with a review of <strong><a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/download/">iTunes 7.3</a></strong> <br>  So, this combine has expanded its capabilities in almost all areas of its activities.  In addition to adding <em>support for the iPhone</em> and working with <em>Apple TV</em> , the player now <em>works smarter with iPods</em> .  Synchronization has become <em>smoother</em> , fixed minor bugs, including a <em>warning that there is not enough space</em> .  Now the player himself will say how much space is needed, but how much space is and how much is not enough. <br>  Work with large media libraries has also been improved - this concerns not only music, but also video.  In addition, the Cover Flow mode is improved, especially for the rendering engine.  Substantial changes with podcasts: now you can add covers to programs, use all cover display modes, redesigned podcast download mechanism.  Changed the sorting order: now artists with articles (a la ‚ÄúThe‚Äù, etc.) are sorted without them.  For example, The Beatles will stand alongside Beethoven, not System Of A Down. <br>  And one more small change - now the color of the selected element of blue shades looks better than in the previous version. <br><br>  Now about the <strong>plugins for iTunes</strong> .  I see many people use the <a href="http://www.lastfm.ru/">Last.FM</a> service.  Another <a href="http://www.lastfm.ru/download/"><em>upgrade</em></a> took into account many of my needs - including iPod support and scrobbling from it.  The design of the program and the quality of scrobbling are also improved.  In addition, a very interesting plugin-visualizer - <a href="http://software.barbariangroup.com/magnetosphere/"><em>Magnetosphere</em></a> .  The main advantages of this plug-in are that the visual range perfectly aligns with the current composition, i.e.  clearly displays bass, drums, vocals, etc. Another advantage of the plug-in is that it is podstayvaetsya under your video card.  Also, the personal opinion of the author, the effects of the plug-in are more beautiful and not so burdening the eye, they are calm and distinct.  The variety of possibilities is not as great as that of a standard visualizer: fireworks and star motifs.  But, unfortunately, a minor flaw was noticed in the work of the add-on: in a mode of incomplete window, through the visualizer, parts of the tree of the playlist list skip.  But in the other modes - everything is just fine.  Try it; it's worth it;). <br><br>  <strong>The following is a story about various video converters</strong> .  Two other excellent converters came to my field of vision - MPEG Streamclip and Videora iPod Converter.  But first things first. <br>  <strong><a href="http://www.squared5.com/">MPEG Streamclip</a></strong> is by far the most powerful tool that is not easy to use.  Getting confused is simple.  Numerous settings that are poorly designed and generally <em>poor interface</em> program repel.  Having understood everything, I converted a half-hour film to the * .mov format.  I was not pleased with the result: in addition to the <em>sound coming before the video</em> , the <em>quality of the video, in many points, leaves much to be desired</em> .  In general, this program I would put <strong>4 out of 5</strong> , given that it supports a <em>huge variety of formats</em> , and can also <em>convert audio</em> .  This program is also a <em>player</em> , and an <em>editor</em> , and can <em>download</em> media.  unconditional plus of the program is a free license.

      <strong><a href="http://www.videora.com/en-us/Converter/iPod/download.php">Videora iPod Converter</a></strong> is a free video converter from popular formats (AVI, WMV, ASF, MPG, FLV, etc.) to formats that support all iPod models except nano and shuffle: MP4 and MOV.  This is an indispensable assistant for those who use iTunes and QuickTime. <br>  The program <em>is simple and easy</em> to use.  Having set the format of the output video, its size (for a player or TV), whether to improve the quality of video and sound, you click on a couple of buttons and - hallelujah!  - wait until the program does its job.  During the transcoding, only the most important information is output: the progress bar, the remaining and elapsed time, the size of the output file and its bitrate.  After the conversion is finished, the program <em>will automatically add the finished video to the iTunes library</em> .  <em>The result is beyond praise</em> : a clear, high-quality image with excellent sound. <br>  Among other things, Videora Converter has a <em>library of converted files</em> in which you can view all the converted files, move them to the player or to iTunes, delete or play. <br>  Hint: For best results, use the MP4 format. <br>  Thus, it is a convenient and powerful video converter with a good interface, with an excellent result of coding, broad support for iPod and Tunes.  Those.  This converter can be safely advised to the owners of iPod Video, as well as those who use iTunes for all its features, because  This software handles its tasks 100%.  So my score is <strong>5 out of 5</strong> ! <br><br>  And, for the road, a useful utility <strong><a href="http://mp3gain.sourceforge.net/">MP3Gain</a></strong> is a utility for equalizing the volume in MP3 music files.  MP3Gain provides the ability to equalize the volume in a single file, and in a group of files (for example, in any music album).  It works quite correctly and does not change the encoding / decoding of an MP3 file, i.e.  the quality of the piece of music remains unchanged, only the sound volume is subjected to processing.  The interface is simple and clear, the user needs to perform only a few actions (specify files and sound level) to work with a music file (or a group of files), the utility will do the rest. <br><br>  Here, for now, everything.  Some will argue that I have not written everything.  Maybe, but these are only the most important features of programs and utilities.  Others will say that I have not described all the programs.  I set myself the task to show only the best, as in my opinion, because people are different;).  I would be very happy to learn some new software and comments on the programs described above.  I did not take on the description of RocBbox - because  I do not want to ruin my player.  if you want to write - then I only for! <br><br>  <strong>PS</strong> Thanks to the <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/nopoc/" class="user_link">nopoc</a> , <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/pooh/" class="user_link">pooh</a> and <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/vitya/" class="user_link">vitya habrauds</a> for the information on the existence of converters (MPEG Streamclip and Videora iPod Converter, respectively) and MP3Gain.  I will hope for their cooperation;). <habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/12333/">https://habr.com/ru/post/12333/</a></p>
