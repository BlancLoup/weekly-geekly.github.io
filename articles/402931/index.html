Have you ever thought about the Big Bang itself?  Fraser Kane will lift the veil of this mystery for you. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  About thirteen and eight billion years ago, the universe was born in an explosion.  She opened the door with her feet, took out the cheese and ice cubes, put a huge bowl with punch and invited all the neighbors to a party, and what kind - to all the parties, until the end of time.

      What happened before that?  What happened before the Big Bang? <br><br>  Considering the history of the Universe, we take the Big Bang as a reference point and study everything that happened after.  Likewise, it is very different than astronomers see the Universe, looking back from the present. <br><br>  All that we can distinguish from here is the relic radiation that appeared three hundred and eighty thousand years after the Big Bang.  Before him, nothing could be made out; the Universe was opaquely dense and hot.  Like pea soup.  A soup of delicious, scalding, high-calorie ‚Äúwhole.‚Äù <br><br>  In a flawed, traditional, terrestrial coordinate system, without the TARDIS, we are not able to see the origin of the Universe from its place in space and time.  Damn you, our place in space and time!  Fortunately, there were clever men who voiced some hypotheses - sometimes crazy, sometimes incomprehensible to the mind, delusional, without exception. <br><br>  First thought: it all began as a kind of quantum oscillation, which expanded to the modern universe.  Something completely elusive, growing over time, gave rise to our existence as a by-product. <br><br>  Alternative version: our universe originated in the black hole of a more ancient universe.  Think about it.  Boil in your pot.  There was some kind of universe right here, but not our universe, then it became a black hole.  And from this hole we were born and everything around us.  Literally, everything that we see, wherever we look, and everything that exists so far only in our imagination. <br><br>  Here's another idea for you: we are constantly seeing the emergence of new particles in the Universe.  But what if, after a long time, a whole army of particles, so that was enough for the universe, appeared at once?  Seriously ... And at first, for a long, long time there were a lot of ‚Äúnot-dissidents‚Äù who were unlucky. <br><br>  Most recently, the BISEP-TWO team found probable evidence of inflation in the early universe.  Their conclusions, like all statements of a similar scale, have caused a tough controversy.  If the inflation version is correct, our universe may be part of a larger multiverse.  And the most popular version of this version involves perpetual expansion, in which universes appear constantly.  And our turned out to be one of them by chance. <br><br>  Perhaps asking what was before the Big Bang is like asking what is north of the North Pole.  Maybe the choice of the angle makes us believe in the existence of the root cause?  We want to think that phenomena should have a reason, but what if the Universe is an exception?  Maybe she just is.  Because. <br><br>  Come up with yourself.  What happened before the party?  Tell us in the comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/402931/">https://habr.com/ru/post/402931/</a></p>
