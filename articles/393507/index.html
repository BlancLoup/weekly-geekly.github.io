True, the joy was not complete, given the departure of Deimos, but over the years he has learned to rejoice in trifles. <br><br>  “Nowhere can we be in time,” thought James, looking at the high-rises of the capital from a car window. <br><br>  The electric motor did not make a single sound, and only the rustling of tires on the asphalt of the road broke the silence of the cabin.  The landscape has changed.  In place of the center and the Ring of Life came the trade row, followed by the general and industrial zones of the capital. <br><br>  “We'll be there soon, sir,” the driver reported. <br><br>  Harris said nothing, only nodded shortly. <br><br>  “How many years have passed?  Thirty?  Thirty five?  I already do not remember what he looks like. ” <br><br>  The car slowed down smoothly at the checkpoint, where the driver presented the highest-level government clearance, and after five minutes Harris went down into the elevator below the ground. <br><br>  Michael was waiting for him on the right floor. <br><br>  “Good day, Councilor Harris,” Ivor greeted him. <br><br>  - Hello, Mike, - he will answer, hugging a comrade, - see, we were wrong, we still saw each other. <br><br>  - Yes, - agreed Ivor, - tea? <br><br>  “No, thank you, a lot of things,” said Harris, “where is our guest?” <br><br>  - Follow me, advisor. <br><br>  Even there could be extra eyes, so they should be careful. <br><br>  Mike led Harris through the hollow corridors of this underground hive.  They walked for at least ten minutes, and the closer James approached Matt, the more his impatience grew. <br><br>  “Almost arrived,” Ivor threw over his shoulder. <br><br>  They turned down the hall for the last time and Mike stopped at one of the doors. <br><br>  “This is an insulator,” he said to James, “planned for the maintenance of riotous experimental subjects, if any, but, as you see, it was also useful for other purposes.” <br><br>  “Yes, not bad,” said James, “is it shooting inside?” <br><br>  “Of course,” said Mike, “but I took care of everything, nothing has been written since your arrival.” <br><br>  “Fine,” Harris didn’t need the extra evidence of his presence here, “would be grateful if you would leave us.” <br><br>  Ivor looked at Harris very carefully and longer than necessary, and then he put a key card in the adviser's hand. <br><br>  “This level is isolated, so Matthew cannot escape.” <br><br>  “All right, I understand,” answered James, “go, Mike, then I myself.”  And they came this girl, Melissa, just in case.  I'm not a fighter, unlike Matt. <br><br>  The surgeon nodded in agreement, slapped James on the shoulder, and walked back down the hall to the guard room. <br><br>  Harris was all at the door.  He heard how the steps of Ivor fell silent in the distance, but he did not enter inside. <br><br>  “Pull yourself together, Jamie!  Forward! ”Harris himself mentally encouraged himself. <br><br>  He brought the card to the reader and the door, locked by an electromagnet, opened with a quiet characteristic sound.  He pushed her and took a step inside. <br><br>  - Hello, Matthew. <br><br>  ** <br><br>  “Good girl,” Ivor smiled at the woman and sat back in his chair, hiding Matt's gun in the drawer, “I promised Deimos that I would tell you everything, Matt.”  This order is still beating in my head, and I cannot oppose it, but our god did not give any other instructions. <br><br>  - And what's next, doctor?  - Matt mattered. <br><br>  “Well, I’ll tell you what I have to, and then we will isolate you and Oliver before the arrival of your esteemed brother, Matthew,” Ivor answered. <br><br>  “It's easier to shoot on the spot,” Melissa loosened her control a little, and it became easier for Matt to speak, but his body still didn’t obey him. <br><br>  “Who knows?” Ivor thought a little about something of his own, and then continued, “Do not misunderstand me, Matt, unlike you, dirty partisans, who killed and killed everyone who was in your way, I found more sophisticated way. <br><br>  - And what?  - Matt asked. <br><br>  “He’s in front of you,” Ivor nodded at Melissa, “operators, telepaths, mind control.”  This society, formed after a global cataclysm, famine, civil war, is now breaking off hundreds of contradictions.  People cannot find a place in this world; they follow the ghostly ideas of the past, instead of raising their heads and admitting that this world will never be the same.  All the great empires were created by the strong hand of the dictatorship, no matter how she presented herself to the people.  Only the sole power of enthusiastic people can bring humanity to greatness. <br><br>  Ivor got up from the table and moved closer to Matt. <br><br>  “Do you not know what we did to the planet, Matt?”  You still found that agonizing world that tried to sit on two chairs at the same time: freedom and progress.  Ball rules capital, as, indeed, now it happens, but everyone pulled the blanket over himself.  And again, history tells us that it does not lead to anything good.  The Persian kingdom, the Roman Empire, the Tatar-Mongols, the Russian Empire, the Soviet Union, the Third Reich — all these states were great, but became pages of history as soon as someone's personal interests came forward.  Dictatorship, Matt is the only effective way to unite humanity.  It can have different faces, different degrees of freedom, but the essence is the same - no one should be the undivided master, because human egoism has no boundaries.  And a person, rather than giving way to another place under the sun, will destroy this place so that it will not get to anyone.  It is this feature of human nature that has set our view on the brink of survival not so long ago.  But, as you see, Commander, we survived, and some, for example, I and your brother also learned the lesson taught to all of us. <br><br>  - Why all this demagogy?  Dictatorship?  It already exists, Matt replied, the army controls everything and everyone. <br><br>  “No, Matt, you are wrong,” objected the old surgeon, “they do not control the most important thing — the heart.”  You can own the body of a man, but you will never comprehend his soul.  The Eye project can change that. <br><br>  - True?  “Matt laughed,” I see, that all three of your main telepaths are under control, especially Deimos. <br><br>  The face of the old surgeon faltered, but he quickly pulled himself together. <br><br>  - Yes, something has gone wrong, but as long as I am alive - I can create new Deimos and new Astrei and Adikiy - this is only a matter of time. <br><br>  “And how are you going to control them?”  How can you control what can get into your mind? <br><br>  - Oh, you did not know?  - Ivor laughed.  - The most valuable thing a person has is his life.  I am only a scientist, but not a magician, Matthew, and the Oka module is a foreign body, and also having contact with the nervous system and the brain. <br><br>  Matt didn't understand anything. <br><br>  “Oh, you didn't tell him, Melissa?”  “Ivor was pleasantly surprised,” Matthew, nobody canceled the rejection of the module with his body.  Without antibiotics and proper care, the operator has a few weeks, and then - Ivor slapped in front of his face with the back of one hand on the other - that's all, the end.  Strange, did you not notice how Melissa did an injection every once a few days so as not to die?  And at the same time, we have another safety net - we can just burn out the Oka module with the help of EMP, and at a very solid distance.  Yes, this requires a powerful installation, but it is possible.  And even if the operator survives thereafter, he will be no more dangerous than petty mongrels. <br><br>  The old commander was stunned. <br><br>  - I thought that we would be able to negotiate with Deimos, his psycho profile was suitable for such work, but, no, not so, the people of your brother will take care of it.  And I will create new “leaders” for the Eye project. <br><br>  “You can never break the will of all people,” Matt replied, “and there are many more of them than you think.” <br><br>  Ivor just smiled at these words. <br><br>  “Yes,” he answered, “I understand that some are less controllable than others, but any barriers can be weakened.”  Do you know how many residents of the capital at the age of thirty have used a new drug at least once, which is popularly called “Angel dust” or “just“ dust ”?  Ask not to be confused with good old cocaine.  Do you know how much? <br><br>  Matt said nothing. <br><br>  - According to the latest data - forty percent.  But the youth is the main inert mass of any society.  All coups and revolutions began with the blood of young, stupid youths, eager for change.  The dust, which was developed under my strict guidance and based on a small concentration of EP-22, opens up their minds.  We will seize control over the lower ranks - and there will be nowhere to grow discontent, everything is simple, commander.  And over whom we will not capture - we will destroy, together with the army.  James was always afraid that not everyone in command would accept this path, but I personally have some agreements - they will definitely take our side when the time comes.  Yes, it is possible that unrest will begin, but our enemies, wherever they may be: among the population, in the government or in the army, there is not a single chance. <br><br>  - The genocide of their own people?  - In Matt's chest, rage boiled, - for some ephemeral goal, initially a failed idea of ​​control over society? <br><br>  “This is not my people,” Ivor raised the tone, “my people remained on another continent, where they safely and perished through the fault of those who put their interests above the common good.”  We do this not out of a lust for power, Matthew, we do it for the sake of the survival of humanity as a species, because otherwise we will lose everything that has been invented and obtained in the last thousand years - we will return to natural economy.  Saving civilization and progress is our main goal, Matthew. <br><br>  The prisoner did not answer, but only tried to understand whether Ivor was seriously speaking now, or was simply mocking him.  In the end, Matt came to the conclusion that he was not - the old surgeon was not joking and believed in what he said. <br><br>  “And you, of course, are the inspiration for all of this, yes, doctor?  - He asked Ivora. <br><br>  “Well,” the surgeon threw one leg over the other, “your brother put a lot of effort into developing this concept to put it into practice.”  Let's put it like this: the Eye project is our joint creation.  Okay, - Ivor got up, resting his palms on his knees, - it became easier for me, which means I told you enough.  Melissa, ”he turned to the telepathic woman,“ escort Commander Matt to the detention center, and then transfer this butcher, Oliver Steele, to separate rooms as well.  Good? <br><br>  “Yes, Dr. Ivor,” Melissa nodded in agreement, “I'll do everything.” <br><br>  “That's nice,” the surgeon returned to his desk, “what advisor Harris decides to do with you,” he added for Matt, “but I wouldn’t have much hope for brotherly love.” <br><br>  ** <br><br>  - Hi, James.  And you are stouter. <br><br>  “Yes,” agreed Counselor Harris, “but also a sex creature.” <br><br>  “I was more fortunate with this,” Matt told his brother, “why did you come?” <br><br>  - We have not seen each other, Matthew. <br><br>  - How many years have passed? <br><br>  - I do not remember.  About thirty, I think, - the adviser answered. <br><br>  - I, and even more so. <br><br>  - Mikhail said that you are aware of our company? <br><br>  “Yes, your test subject gave him a rather ironic attitude before leaving this place,” Matt confirmed. <br><br>  - That's how it is.  Will I sit down? <br><br>  “Yes, of course,” Matt moved up on his bed, making room for his brother. <br><br>  James Harris sat down beside him. <br><br>  “You now have every chance of becoming the extraordinary head of the council, Jamie,” said Matt, “you caught the first two enemies of the state.” <br><br>  James laughed. <br><br>  “Matthew, you understand perfectly well that for the last ten years you and Oliver have been rather personal enemies of individuals rather than enemies of the people.  Active battles ended long ago. <br><br>  “This is a long time ago,” Matt agreed. <br><br>  He was extremely calm.  The days of waiting led to the fact that he realized that he was no longer living alive.  James won't allow it. <br><br>  They were silent for a while. <br><br>  “I'm tired of playing these double and triple games, Matthew, you can’t even imagine how badly I am tired,” James rubbed his face with his hands, as if trying to take off the burden he was talking about.  - Hatred is a warrior to you and your alternative, as I call it for myself, look at the social system, I was, at times, simply amazed.  Any attempts to reach the world broke about their stubbornness. <br><br>  - Warriors?  “Matt was surprised,” I always thought the council was in control of the army. <br><br>  “No matter how it is,” laughed James, “this structure has grown so tightly together with the money-bags controlling the capital that it has turned from a state structure into a private one.  I also gained some influence on a number of councilors, but against the background of the army, these achievements fade. <br><br>  Matt tried to digest what was said.  He always believed that his main enemies were sitting in the oval hall of the Council, however, everything turned out to be much more prosaic. <br><br>  “This country in general has always been subject to a symbiosis of power and capital, and not having contracts for the purchase of weapons, equipment and foodstuffs, the latter felt not the best way,” added James. <br><br>  - And to arrange cleaning?  Expose, shift?  - Matt asked. <br><br>  - Not so simple, brother.  It's like chopping the head of a hydra: you will cut off one, and in its place will grow two.  To burn out these parasites is possible only with one blow. <br><br>  - And for this project was created Eye?  “Matt asked, seriously?”  Based on what your partner, Ivor, told me, this was a replacement for soap. <br><br>  James shook his head. <br><br>  “Matthew, remember what you always told me when we were young?” <br><br>  - Do not believe anyone? <br><br>  - Exactly.  Mike Ivor just performs his function, nothing more.  Operators are an enviable tool.  Fully dependent on medical care and easily disposable, at the same time they were a tasty morsel for the army.  Sent to the units as a gesture of goodwill, a tribute from me to the army commander, they perform the function of Trojan horses. <br><br>  Matt is completely confused. <br><br>  - Wait, what do you mean by that? <br><br>  “Hydra can be defeated only by destroying it all at once,” answered James, “but let me start again.”  Captain Henry Johnson, whom you know as Deimos, worked for me several years ago.  After Mike Ivor came to me with the documentation on the Eye project, with Nikitinsky notes and his own calculations, I began to look for alternative sources of information.  And you know, Matthew, I found them.  The data about the experiments of the Russian professor came to intelligence before the drought.  And, most surprisingly, instead of developing their own telepaths, the then leaders decided to start deploying a counter-mental shield.  A network of "wilderness" waves emitted by operators was created along the entire east coast.  For normal people, harmless, but for telepaths - things are very unpleasant. <br><br>  - And what from this? <br><br>  “Do not interrupt,” answered James, “my engineers said that the equipment was perfectly calibrated and, with some modifications, it can be converted into operator signal repeaters.  Captain Henry Johnson was one of the leaders of the search group, they found mothballed objects with equipment and transported them to the capital. <br><br>  - So, what is next?  Well, do you have repeaters, but why? <br><br>  - To send a sufficiently clean and clear signal, an operator with a high level of synchronization was needed for the order to be executed accurately.  We tested hundreds of soldiers, but as it turned out, very few people approached.  But Henry showed perfect results. <br><br>  - So he voluntarily went for it?  “Matt was amazed,” he turned into, as far as I know, a psychopath. <br><br>  “Yes,” agreed James, “something went wrong, but given that Henry left the Center, I believe that he is still in his right mind.” <br><br>  - And what did you agree, huh? <br><br>  James folded his hands in his lap and looked ahead. <br><br>  - Matt, Henry, Deimos, or whatever you call him, has his own mission - to start a new revolution.  Only Mike believes that it will be aimed at creating a humble, loyal to us, and specifically to him, the society under the control of operators, but in reality the goal is simple: to destroy the army command and all those associated with it with one blow.  To deliver such a blow to the army “hydra”, after which the power will actually go to the Soviet.  To do this, Captain Johnson will use a network of repeaters to launch a simultaneous attack on all fronts. <br><br>  Matt presented how, at one moment, in all parts, to which fifty operators were assigned, the slaughter begins. <br><br>  “Do you want to drown the Capital in blood, Jamie?” <br><br>  “This will be no innocent blood, Matt,” the adviser answered. <br><br>  They heard faraway footsteps behind the door. <br><br>  “Oh, and Melissa,” said James. <br><br>  “Yes, because of her fault, I was locked up,” Matt growled. <br><br>  “It's not that simple, Matthew.”  She is a good soldier, but she also plays a double game, but I was not against it. <br><br>  - In terms of? <br><br>  - It was sent to me by Richard O'Connell, the colonel of counterintelligence, in fact, the king and god of his department.  He dug his nose to understand what was going on in the country, however, he dug in the wrong direction - under me.  But I forgive him for this, - James smiled, - if you tell her that you need to see Richard, she will lead you to him, and then decide what to do next. <br><br>  - Listen, I certainly understand everything ... - Matt was puzzled. <br><br>  “Time is short, Matthew, do not interrupt,” James interrupted him, “I believe that Michael is playing in two camps: mine and the army.”  Melissa will be able to close only one mind from other operators, so you will get out of here.  I can’t influence anything anyway, it’s still not today, then tomorrow, the military police will come after me, they’re close, and it’s impossible to establish peace between the resistance and the Council without you. <br><br>  He slapped Matt on the shoulder and continued: <br><br>  - I'm very tired, brother, and you have to go.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Find O'Connell and help Henry. And I'll give you a little head start. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">While Matt was trying to figure out what was going on, James reached for something under his jacket and after a moment a gun dimly flashed in his hand. The adviser put the trunk to the head, just above the ear. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">“Bye, Matthew,” said James and pulled the trigger.</font></font><br><br>  ** <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Melissa was a little surprised that she was sent to the detention centers where Matt and Oliver were held. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">“Nothing special, just Counselor Harris decided to make secure,” Ivor said, looking at her from the screen of the communications terminal, “come down here and see that everything goes fine.” </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And now she walked down a long corridor to the rooms, where almost a week ago she locked people who considered her to be their comrade-in-arms. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Vile feeling. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">“What have you gotten me into, Richard?” The woman thought, “I didn’t register as traitors. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Already at the door, she heard the sound of a shot. Melissa abruptly pushed the door and burst into the room.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Matt was sitting on the bed with a completely startled expression on his face, and adviser James Harris was lying next to him. Melissa thought to attack the old commander using the Oka module, but at the last moment she noticed that he was unarmed. The pistol lay in the adviser's hand, and she was here a couple of seconds after the shot. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- What the hell happened here? - She screamed at Matt. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">“I don’t know,” he answered, “my brother just took and knocked out his brains.” </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Do not play the fool, Commander! Did you shoot him ?! </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- You can check why you ask? - snapped Matt.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">His voice was full of pain and bitterness, and Melissa realized that in whatever relationship these two were, they were brothers. The woman touched Matt's mind and saw everything that had happened: the dim glitter of the pistol, farewell and a shot. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">“C'mon ...” she said quietly. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">“Melly,” Matt began to come to his senses, “Advice ... James, before ... Do what I did, mentioned Richard, the colonel, it seems.” Do you know him. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This question drove Melissa into an even bigger stupor. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Yes I know. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">“Great,” said Matt, “help Oliver and I get out of here and bring him in, this is very important, you understand?” Otherwise, my brother shot himself for nothing. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">“Richard, how does he know about Richard? Councilor Harris told him?</font></font> But why?<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Richard warned that he could not be trusted. ” </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Will you help us? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Melissa just nodded in response. She took out a key card with a photo of Dr. Ivor from the breast pocket of her deceased jacket, snapped her tongue in satisfaction and, showing the loot to Matt, said: </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">“This is our ticket from here.” Now we take Oliver, he is in the next room, and out. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">“Take care,” Matt replied, “and I'll catch up.” </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After Melissa walked out the door, Matt walked over to the body. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- What kind of game did you start? - He turned to the dead man, - and where did she bring you? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He bent down, pulled a pistol out of the still warm, as if it belonged to a still-living person, and looked at his brother for the last time. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Bye, James.</font></font><br><hr><br><h4>  ,       ,           GT,  ,      ,   VK   ,  <b><a href="http://vk.com/projecteye"> «»</a></b> .
