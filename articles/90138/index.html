After answering one letter (answered, trying to help, for it was curious :) the next one comes.  I do not know this person, I have never heard of him, and I have no idea who he is.  The addressee‚Äôs first and last name are the same, the email addresses are different.  Striking style of letters.  And if the first could be fitted with a stretch to try to extract the password, then the rest and not stand next to it.  The letters are obviously connected, and not by a computer, but by a man.  Question to the community: <i>"And you had it?</i>  <i>Spam, divorce or UFO?</i>  <i>What is the highlight? ‚Äù</i> Curiosity has already tortured, I ask for help, thanks in advance :) <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><blockquote>  Eugene, hello! <br><br>  Tell me, please, what are the settings for the mail program using the POP3 protocol for working with Gmail mail?

      Sincerely. </blockquote><br><blockquote>  Eugene, hello! <br><br>  If you remember, you advised me to install Kaspersky Anti-Virus instead of ECET NOD32, which I had before.  And you can not tell how it is possible to get the continuation of the possibility of working with ECET NOD32?  I like it more than Kaspersky Anti-Virus.  The fact is that Kaspersky Anti-Virus is somehow annoying.  They say that the best referee is the one who is not noticeable on the field :-).  And Kaspersky Anti-Virus starts a ‚Äúquick‚Äù scan for a long time when the computer starts up, and then, just now, it issued a ‚Äúbrilliant‚Äù message in general, ‚ÄúThe file is a Trojan program.  Healing and deletion is not possible because the file is being used by another program.  Unlock the file. ".  And how is that ???  I have something here, there is a ‚ÄúUnlock‚Äù button !?  What do you need to do?!  Kaspersky Anti-Virus means that he himself does not know and blames all responsibility for possible incorrect actions of the user on the user himself.  It will not go like this.  After this message, I clicked somewhere, in general, there was some kind of the most stupid message, understandable except for Blin Gates (and even that was hardly).  And on the A: drive, although there is no diskette in it, Kaspersky Anti-Virus scrubs so that it will break it in a month.  In ESET NOD32, there was nothing like that, I installed it - and no settings, everything is by default.  In general, I applied a radical method of struggle against arbitrariness - I turned off the computer.  Plug from the socket.  Now Kaspersky Anti-Virus is disabled.  So better for health.  Of mine  The computer is a minor matter.  But still.  Tell me, please, if a return to the ECET NOD32 is impossible, what should be all the installations of Kaspersky Anti-Virus, so that it turns out to be a good arbiter, and not an annoying stupid parent :-). <br><br>  Sincerely. </blockquote><br><blockquote>  Eugene, hello today again! <br><br>  Sorry to bother you, but I still have 2 problems: <br><br>  1. When the computer was completely disconnected from the network, it began (for a long time) to forget the date, time and system settings.  Removed the standing battery from <br>  motherboard - yes, it is completely discharged.  But replaced it with new - all the same.  I checked the new item - no, it was not dead. <br>  What else can be the reason for forgetting system installations? <br><br>  2. Gmail mail for all installations specified by the link that you sent me does not work with Microsoft Outlook Email program <br>  11. I spent several days and today in the morning.  Useless.  I decided to try on Mail, maybe a fool himself - nothing like this: <br>  in one fell swoop started a new address.  And nothing needs to be set up, it works right away.  Here, in fact, from him and convey this message. <br>  Apparently, Gmail for supermasters, I do not know why he is so problematic.  And what are his advantages, by the way, over the same, say, <br>  Mail?  Here you have, as I understand it, there is a corporate lateps, which is probably paid, and therefore reliable, but then gmail ... <br><br>  Sincerely. </blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/90138/">https://habr.com/ru/post/90138/</a></p>
