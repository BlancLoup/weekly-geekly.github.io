  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Open move. "Finguru" is looking for like-minded people to create a global IT-service</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d14/578/b19/d14578b19232dd8722196ae93ea35b12.png" alt="image">  In our previous article <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/a-practic/blog/228359/">‚ÄúHow we created a mass accounting service,‚Äù</a> we talked about the principles and rules of the company ‚ÄúFinguru‚Äù.  In today's post, we would like to make the readers an offer of <a href="http://fingu.ru/article/licenses/">cooperation</a> .  We invite everyone to participate in the creation of an "advanced" accounting service, which has no analogues yet. <br><br>  Here we will share what we already have - our own work and thoughts ‚Äúto whom and why this is beneficial‚Äù, and at the end of the article we would like to get feedback on how you offer us, whether you are ready to join us and offer your ideas. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, to the point of our proposal.  Entrepreneurs hate accounting.  And accountants do not know how to sell.  But both of them should interact with each other, often without understanding the specifics of each work.  FinGouru will ‚Äúhelp with accounting‚Äù to any businessman, but now we are also ready to help with the conduct of our business to any accounting firm.  And all this thanks to our developments in the following areas: <br><br><h3>  I. Marketing and sales.  Sharing a brand </h3><br>  We offer a kind of franchise history for small and large accounting firms.  A company (or even one remote accountant-homeworker) can still work under his own name, but be accredited from Finguru in his own city. <br>  <b>Why it is beneficial for small companies:</b> we solve for them the problem of attracting customers (some will come directly from our site, some - when they independently search for the Finguru brand in their city). <br>  <b>Why it is beneficial for large companies.</b>  As a rule, large companies have no problems attracting new customers, but there is another one - the ‚Äúceiling‚Äù, a certain number of customers that they can serve.  Usually it is 50-100 companies.  We will help large companies not only to attract customers, but also to serve them effectively.

    <h3>  Ii.  Documents and processes.  Sharing standards </h3><br>  Each accounting firm has to create its own documents: from the texts of service contracts to letters to customers.  But why reinvent the wheel.  We have hundreds of necessary templates ready and they work fine.  And most importantly - part of the processes that are performed in other accounting firms by people, we are fully automated. <br>  <b>Example: an</b> entrepreneur did not file an act on time. <br>  How this problem is solved in a regular accounting firm: an employee opens Excel or 1C (underline the necessary) and starts a ‚Äúmanual‚Äù search for a forgetful client.  After that sends him a letter. <br><br> <a href=""><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/090/507/d78/090507d7847e33c2d0cec7c1fb199680.jpg" alt="image"></a>  How this problem is solved in the "Finguru": the system itself finds the "debtor" and itself sends a polite letter to it.  And with the address by name and detailed indication of further actions - the recipient has the feeling that an employee of the company is having a dialogue with him, and not a robot. <br>  <b>Why it is beneficial for small companies.</b>  No need to spend time on creating texts of documents, letters, appeals, do not need to keep a calendar of reminders for each client.  It's easier to take a turnkey solution with us and start working. <br><br><h3>  Iii.  Production software.  Sharing convenience </h3><br>  The advantages of the production software from "Finguru" - a set of "chips" that make working with documents as simple, convenient and fast. <br>  <b>Example: a</b> client sends an invoice to the accountant with a list of one hundred items.  The accountant must translate this document into electronic form in order to proceed.  Previously, you would have to manually re-arrange each position, and it would take more than one hour.  But with the software from "Finguru" this problem is solved in a couple of minutes.  See for yourself: <br>  <b>Why it is beneficial for large companies.</b>  Saving resources and staff time.  Ready-made work standards, automated in the CRM-system. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/8ewjsRT8dFM%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhi19KLg0tpLmo2GdZtNMidMR2Uu4A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>Why it is beneficial for small companies.</b>  First, it seriously saves time, which means you can serve more customers.  Secondly, all software has already been ‚Äúsharpened‚Äù for an accounting service, which means that it is not necessary to compile the solution from different ready-made software products or to search for developers for their side solutions.  In addition, such searches are fraught with serious spending, but not the fact that the result will be satisfactory. <br>  <b>Why it is beneficial for large companies.</b>  We recognize that large companies have their own automation systems for various processes (this is the popular 1C, systems for sending reports via the Internet), but our solutions will serve not as a replacement, but as a good addition to this list.  Just add the blocks you need to your systems: electronic document flow, scanning and recognition of the primary, checking contractors, electronic archive - and enjoy the result. <br><br><h3>  Iv.  Management software.  Share tasks </h3><br>  Management software from "Finguru" is a powerful CRM-system, closely integrated into business processes and existing accounting software.  Perhaps for small companies this is not so necessary (due to the lack of a large staff and clients), but for large ones this is a big plus.  Our software allows not only to distribute tasks among employees and control their implementation, but also to simplify the lives of customers.  Management software from ‚ÄúFinguru‚Äù does not require installation on a computer, and it is not only closely connected with professional accounting programs (such as 1C and Kontur Accounting), but also with other information systems: electronic document management, online conferencing, etc. <br><br><h3>  V. Training and support.  Sharing knowledge </h3><br>  Who can an accountant contact if he has a professional question?  Most often the answer is sought in forums or in regulations.  In the first case - not the fact that the answer will be correct, in the second - it may take too much time to find the right answer.  "Finguru" contains an electronic knowledge base in the form of cases, similar cases and financial transactions. <br>  Example: an accountant needs to post to a currency account.  To consider in this particular case the VAT or not to consider?  And if you count, how?  For help, he can contact the personal manager "Finguru" and get not only an answer, but also an example of such a transaction from our database. <br><br>  <b>Conclusions:</b> we are open for further collaboration with entrepreneurs, accounting firms, IT-specialists.  Our ultimate goal is to automate business processes, making accounting services simple and fast.
