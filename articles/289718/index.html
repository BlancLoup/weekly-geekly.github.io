We have to spend a lot of time and effort to tell about the product / service, practice in building the logic of the conversation.  The turnover in such departments is often very large.  And again, you need to train, bring up to date, spend time.  Vicious circle. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  We ourselves have been active in sales for 10 years.  In the past 2 years also advise their clients. <br>  The problem with the training of telephone sellers and we and most of the companies we know is acute.

      The process of course in different companies is built differently, but it boils down in large to three points: <br><ul><li>  Product training / service.  A beginner is piled up with a bunch of talmuds (or files, entries in the corporate wiki) with properties, features, options, differences, sales techniques.  A newcomer is cramming for a long time, he is checked, but in the end, he still constantly makes mistakes for a long time.  Yes, he has it all at hand, but looking for a file, flipping through 5 pages in search of what you need during a conversation is not convenient. </li><li>  Beginners are taught how to work with CRM.  Where to click, how to fill in correctly, you must be told that ‚Äúin no case should we forget this‚Äù (we hope that you have CRM).  Of course, then often it is ‚Äúthis‚Äù that they forget to fill in, and they often ask what is right about one, second, third. </li><li>  Verbal recommendations are given to the newcomer: how to present themselves, what to say, what you need to ask.  In the head of the recruit porridge and horror. </li></ul><br><br>  What happens next?  Phrases are modified, questions are not asked, the teacher sits with the student (or listens to the notes) and tries to correct him.  The brain of our student is in full swing. <br>  And so - every time, equally, tedious. <br><br>  <b>What to do with it?</b>  <b>The answers are obvious - to train faster, faster to throw into battle.</b>  <b>But how?</b> <br><br>  Give the newcomer a tool with which he will almost immediately start working.  The time-tested tool is a telephone conversation script, with meticulously spelled out correct phrases, answers to all tricky questions, reminders of what needs to be done at the current stage of the conversation. <br>  And in such a way that the necessary information was always before your eyes. <br>  Of course, the first thing we had for a long time was the conversation scripts in text files, it‚Äôs better than nothing, but it‚Äôs difficult to use them in a conversation, you still have to think. <br><br>  Quite a while ago, we had 2 questions: <br><ul><li>  how to show our scenarios to the operator in a convenient way </li><li>  how to enable the head of the department to compile and edit scripts conveniently and without special knowledge. </li></ul><br><br>  At one time we were looking for a technical solution for ourselves and did not find it.  More precisely, we did not find a suitable option for the cost - CRM sharpened for call-centers, in which there are script designers are extremely expensive, and we already had a ‚ÄúCorporate Portal‚Äù from 1C Bitrix. <br>  We decided to write a module for it, because we could not work further. <br><br>  Well, and when we did it, we appreciated it in practice - we decided to make the module available to others. <br>  You can already get acquainted with its versions <a href="http://callhelp.kit-media.com/">here</a> . <br>  While the application is available for the cloud Bitrix24, Bitrix24 in the box and a standalone web application. <br>  In the future, we will work on other integrations with popular CRM. <br>  The module is paid, each version has a trial period, the number of users is not limited. <br><br>  So far, not everything that was conceived has been done, but even at the current stage of development, the module is sure that it will facilitate the work of very many people and will improve the results of sales departments. <br><br>  We will be grateful for the feedback, advice and suggestions - it is for this that we are in such a hurry to publish it in order to get feedback and lead the development looking around at real users. <br><br>  In the future, we will write about the module, the writing of the scripts themselves and much more related to telephone sales. <br>  Order interesting topics for you. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/289718/">https://habr.com/ru/post/289718/</a></p>
