We got used to it, that we are always in touch, that at any moment we will be able to call any familiar person to any point on Earth, that there is always a Network at hand.  And if we happen to adore gadgets, we will become completely helpless.  If a person takes away all electronics, will he remain calm for a long time?  Day?  Two?  Why, what's the day, especially teens-inspired comrades like me feel discomfort only from the thought that it will not be possible to use the Internet or a mobile phone.

    <a name="habracut"></a>  So that such unpleasant situations did not even arise hypothetically, progressive mankind invented removable batteries, which can be quickly replaced and ‚Äúput into operation‚Äù again.  However, what to do if the battery is built-in?  Or do you always have several devices with you?  Do not carry the same scattering batteries?  Sockets on the trees in the parks - this is also clearly not an option, you know, then you have to bother with regard to the energy consumed, followed by payment ... <br><br>  In general, while the panacea for a steady battery is an external power source, which is connected to the devices via the charging jack using one of the complete adapters.  The solution may not be the most elegant in terms of comfort (after all, wires, adapters ...), but it definitely has a lot of advantages.  First, in order for the phone or any other device to regain its strength, you do not need to turn it off, as it would be in the case of battery replacement, and secondly, due to the presence of several adapters, you can charge several different batteries from one external battery. devices throughout the day. <br>  But these are all lyrics, and give you the facts, right?  Therefore, as an example, I will cite a pair of Xpal Power batteries, which by chance and one good person fell into my hands.  One of them is compatible with almost all mobile equipment, ranging from laptops to various small things, and the other is designed exclusively for mobile phones and others like them, but it can ‚Äúrefuel‚Äù not only from the network, but also from the sun.  I spent a month with these things, and now I can tell in colors what it is like to feel even more mobile than usual :) <br><br>  Experience, I must say, turned out the most positive, and it began with astonishment at the modest size of a rather capacious lithium-polymer battery.  Both occupy an insignificant part of the depths of the average size of a backpack, and make it easy to place there what is planned to be charged during the day.  In my case, this is a netbook, camera and player.  Mobile phone safely travels in your pocket. <br><br><img alt="XPAL Power Apollo SP2000" width="525" src="http://newswrighter.cyberstyle.ru/UserFiles/Image/xpal_power/6.jpg"><br><br>  The smaller gadget, called SP2000 or Apollo, is designed to charge various small devices such as mobile phones, PDAs, books on electronic ink, etc. It is unlikely to be able to share energy with something more impressive, because its output voltage is low Namely, ‚Äúuesbeshnoye‚Äù - 5 volts, and the battery capacity is only 2000 mAh, that is, one and a half to two battery capacities of the average communicator.  But a small capacity is not a bug in general, but rather a feature.  The developers obviously had a goal: to make a lightweight compact charger, but a large capacity is a large size.  Therefore, instead of making a large capacious battery, they made it small, but almost autonomous, aligning it with solar cells.  Yes, of course, it‚Äôs faster to charge the battery in advance at home - it will take four hours (it‚Äôs written in the manual that it is three), but, let's say, you went to nature for the whole weekend, and of course there are no outlets in the trees and are not even planned.  It is then that they come to the rescue - photoelectric converters: press the button on the side of Apollo and watch how the flaps of the lid open in different directions, exposing the cells hidden inside.  After that, put the device somewhere on the stump in the sun and wait.  How long we wait, I will not say for sure, because everything depends on the brightness of the sun and the angle at which its rays hit the photosensitive elements, but in ideal conditions, when there is not a cloud in the sky, and the device is turned perpendicular to the flow of photons coming from our star, fully charged The SP2000 can make it in six to eight hours.  And for those who already poorly remember the school curriculum in geometry and can hardly resurrect from memory, which means the word is perpendicular, not to mention rays and photons, one of the four LEDs located on the front of the device is provided.  It burns red the brighter, the more perfect the conditions of feeding.  Yet together, these diodes are an indicator that, by pressing a small button, shows how much more energy remains inside. <br><br><img alt="XPAL Power Apollo SP2000" width="525" src="http://newswrighter.cyberstyle.ru/UserFiles/Image/xpal_power/7.jpg"><br><br>  A charged battery is connected to a discharged device using the bundled (in the sense of the Apollo kit) twisted cord with a standard USB plug at one end and an adapter at the other.  These SP2000 adapters come with six pieces, and they fit Nokia, SonyEricsson, Samsung, and LG.  But if the needed one was not included, you can do with a USB-charger from a mobile phone kit or any other device with a suitable plug at the end.  For example, for the iPhone, the adapter was not included in the kit, but it began to charge perfectly on its white cord.  And besides, by registering on the manufacturer's website ( <a href="http://xpalpower.com/">xpalpower.com</a> ), you can get from him for free the two necessary connectors on the farm.  And this can be done not once, but once a year.  So if you get a new gadget, which also requires charging on the way, you will not be left empty-handed. <br><br><img alt="XPAL Power Apollo SP2000" width="525" src="http://newswrighter.cyberstyle.ru/UserFiles/Image/xpal_power/1.jpg"><br><br>  Apollo's older brother is named Victor or XP18000.  The number in its name unambiguously hints at the battery capacity - 18000 mAh at a voltage of 5 V. That is, in the region of 18 full recharges of a mobile phone battery.  Here, as you understand, engineers took the opposite approach: let the battery be very capacious to last for a long time, and nothing that it becomes heavy and rather large.  Yes, and decided to abandon the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãsolar cells.  I suppose because it would take much longer to fully charge this model, even though their area would slightly increase along with the size of the device, because the efficiency of these converters is still at a rather low level.  But "Victor" has three output connectors. <br><br><img alt="XPAL Power Apollo SP2000" width="525" src="http://newswrighter.cyberstyle.ru/UserFiles/Image/xpal_power/3.jpg"><br><br>  One - the same five-volt USB, the second is marked blue and gives a voltage of 16-20 V, and the third - light green - at 9-12 V. Thus, you can charge not only small gadgets, but also all sorts of video cameras, laptops, etc. Moreover, all these connectors can be used at the same time, which sometimes is archiudic.  To do this, the XP18000 kit contains three cables, six adapters for mobile phones, the same number for laptops and three connectors for all sorts of media devices.  All plugs and cords are marked with the appropriate color so that no one has any confusion about which nest it is intended for. <br><br><img alt="XPAL Power Apollo SP2000" width="525" src="http://newswrighter.cyberstyle.ru/UserFiles/Image/xpal_power/2.jpg"><br><br>  At the same time, both batteries look like they came off the conveyor exclusively for photo shoots: all are glossy, of good plastic, do not creak, do not play, the details fit.  Of course, cognitive dissonance arises ... How do you carry them everywhere with you?  After all, spoil, and then what was all this boxed gloss?  The answer is simple: they need to be transported in black fabric covers under velvet, where all adapters with wires are placed.  But unfortunately it does not save from scratches on the case, because the device still has to be pulled out during use. <br><br><img alt="XPAL Power Apollo SP2000" width="525" src="http://newswrighter.cyberstyle.ru/UserFiles/Image/xpal_power/4.jpg"><br><br>  In general, I can say that the gizmos are extremely convenient and useful.  Victor can provide energy to a mobile phone or communicator for at least a fortnight, or several times extend the autonomous life of a laptop.  And Apollo will not only share energy with the communicator in field conditions, but also be able to non-trivially attract anyone‚Äôs attention.  Girls, for example, having seen an unusual device, begin to show genuine interest to its owner: ‚ÄúAnd what is this about you here?  Solar battery?  Wahhhhhhhhhhhh .. <br><br>  <em>¬© Zvyagin Ivan, 2009, for <a href="http://cyberstyle.ru/">CyberStyle.ru</a> , but of course I can‚Äôt share it with habra people :).</em> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/74617/">https://habr.com/ru/post/74617/</a></p>
