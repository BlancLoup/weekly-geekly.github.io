While working on the anti-spam service, I manually combed a couple of hundreds of popular blogs and looked at a couple of thousand sites referenced by commentators. <br><br>  There were posts in which <em>eight out of ten comments were spamming</em> , and these cretins even ‚Äútalked‚Äù with each other with phrases like ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt understand anything‚Äù or ‚Äúcool, author respect‚Äù. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      The remaining two comments belonged to the blogger who thoroughly responded to the typical comment "I did not understand anything what you mean." <br><br>  And there are a lot of such totally filthy posts, there are thousands of them.  <a href="http://blog.micromarketing.ru/images/2008-03-17-spammers-suck/spammed.txt">The first 215</a> , just continue to be too lazy to copy. <br><br>  Where do these numerous ‚ÄúDima Nevers‚Äù, ‚Äúal777‚Äù, ‚ÄúPskov women‚Äù and ‚ÄúVavans‚Äù come from? <br><br>  Spinning one spam net, in the second ten domains I came across a <a href="http://tinyurl.com/2tlaop" rel="external nofollow">curious page</a> : <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/bfd/e1b/5e9/bfde1b5e94397f20312f097463f50ec1.png" alt="Spammer buys sixes for blogging"><br><br>  Pay attention to the screenshot.  Goblins who scatter thousands of junk comments for links are paid <strong>two bucks for 13 links</strong> .  Excellent earnings for diligent cretin.  By the way, here is the result of their efforts: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/377/288/1b7/3772881b7d83095777cf4106d675c815.png" alt="Sixes reports about blogging"><br><br>  There are a lot of such links there, hundreds.  Nerds love spamming on Anton Popov, Viktor Zakharchenko, Maule, Dimka and many others on blogs (download list of links).  Spammed Perfectomania, TooDoo and dozens, if not hundreds. <br><br>  Moreover, it is worthwhile for the blog owner to leave one larva postponed by the spammer, as a few more amateurs flock to the smell.  The missing spam comment is a signal for the rest: you can turn around here. <br><br>  New industry is scheduled, not worse than postal spam or porn.  Please note that the customer recommends that his cret shit blogs, in which there is no spam.  There are also recommendations on how to do it correctly. <br><br>  By the way, there is even its own software.  Automatic text snatchers, typo generators, synonym substitutes <br><br><h2>  Victims of spammers </h2><br><br>  What does a typical spammer victim look like?  Here <a rel="external" href="http://www.blog.in.ua/2008/02/01/ttelefonru-rrespekt/">is a blog post by Viktor Zakharchenko</a> .  Of the 15 comments, <strong>all 15 are spam</strong> !  By the way, Victor has the Spam Karma plugin installed.  Apparently, he does not help here.  Akismet does not help either, who likes to kill normal comments more and slow down the work of the blog. <br><br>  Such a dump is not conducive to meaningful discussion, maintaining the interest of readers, etc.  Do you want comments on your blog to become someone else?  Look, because there is not a single comment from a normal reader, there is no room left.  If they did, they would have drowned in the stream of spam comments. <br><br>  The authors spend a lot of time on the development of their blogs, write articles to promote them, but do not think about protecting their investments.  <strong>Kommentskrementy repel audience.</strong> <br><br><h2>  In the animal world </h2><br><br>  Watching blog spammers, you can even roughly determine which splogs belong to the same spammer.  For example, only some of the dozens of conversations belonging to the same citizen: <br><br><ul><li>  tixonov.ru ‚ÄúTikhonov in the network.  <strong>Life</strong> as I see it. ‚Äù </li><li>  malow.ru ‚ÄúEvgeny Malov's blog.  About me, <strong>about life</strong> " </li><li>  mikebelov.ru ‚ÄúMike Belov's personal blog.  Just <strong>about life</strong> " </li><li>  sokolow.ru "The diary of Mikhail Sokolov.  About my hobbies, about friends, <strong>about life</strong> ... " </li></ul><br><br>  All "about life", about her, darling.  What a delight, downright affection!  Here are some more virtual peppers: <br><br><ul><li>  dymow.ru "Dymov <strong>in the network</strong> " </li><li>  polyakow.ru "Poles <strong>in the network</strong> " </li></ul><br><br>  Here the principle is slightly different.  Another whole pack of these caught: <br><br><ul><li>  neweroff.ru "Dmitry Neverov's online diary." </li><li>  sawichev.ru "Blog about everything and nothing" </li></ul><br><br>  Common features can be traced already in the choice of a domain name.  Some kind of surname, some letters are replaced.  Most often, this spammer replaces v with w.  The title of the splog and its ‚Äúdescription‚Äù are designed to imitate a ‚Äúblog about everything and nothing‚Äù belonging to a real person. <br><br>  The challenge is for owners of spammed blogs to accept this spamming crap for real blogs, but not to clean them up.  That's just the trouble, they steal something from the same RSS-feeds!  Although, with very, very many rolls. <br><br>  Another spammer was also not particularly wise with the choice of domain names: <br><ul><li>  zigfilm.ru </li><li>  zightml.ru </li><li>  zigdogs.ru </li><li>  zigpizza.ru </li></ul><br><br>  Here are a few domains owned by a negligent spam customer, thanks to which we received a healthy list of spammed blogs and wonderful screenshots: <br><ul><li>  cat2build.ru </li><li>  all2cat.ru </li><li>  music2cat.ru </li><li>  sound2cat.ru </li><li>  video2cat.ru </li><li>  image2cat.ru </li><li>  cat2work.ru </li></ul><br><br>  There are adherents of literary subjects: <br><br><ul><li>  4italknigy.info </li><li>  biglitera.info </li><li>  bibliograf.info </li></ul><br><br><h2>  SMO-shniki or SEO-shniki? </h2><br><br>  I can not comment on the <a href="http://dikiy.com/blog/archive/2008/02/27/ssmo-mmust-die.html" rel="external nofollow">persecution of the unfortunate SMO-Schnick</a> and the <a href="http://news2.ru/story/37352/" rel="external nofollow">discrediting of the very term SMO</a> , developed, as it seems to me, either because of some kind of topersonal dislike for one of them (hello, Ilya), or because of a misunderstanding of the work of <em>real</em> experts on Social Media Optimization . <br><br>  Working with social networks involves attracting people, and not links for search engines.  By the way, blogs in vain persecuted SMO-Schnick too pretty spammed. <br><br>  Of the several thousand spamming comments, maybe two or three of them had some dubious relationship to the SMO.  All these comments are the fruit of SEO work.  Normal optimizers please do not be offended, this is not about you. <br><br>  Remember, some time ago, one disgraceful office of "advertisers" from St. Petersburg spammed by telephone the clients of competing companies?  Very much they were pushing for "promotion of articles", and they built slander and slander on competitors. <br><br>  So, in order to pump the TIC and Pagerank dumps "articles", such offices and spam blogs.  Especially distinguished one "directory of articles of construction subjects." <br><br>  Spammers are very fond of construction, tourism, cellular themes.  I downloaded a dozen or two splogs or "article directories" - and now there is a significant savings in links. <br><br>  Many, by the way, start splogs with automatically stolen content only in order to ‚Äúpump‚Äù them and then sell links on exchanges. <br><br><h2>  Samples of comments </h2><br><br>  We continue our entertaining biology.  Like other members of the animal world, blog spammers emit garbage.  Collecting samples of spam creativity, I found several varieties of comments. <br><br>  <strong>Podmykivanie.</strong>  Traces of Spamerus Cretinus Vulgaris.  The most primitive form of spam available even to spambots. <br><br><blockquote>  Bomber: <br>  February 6, 2008/6: 19 pm <br>  Quickly EPT :) </blockquote><br><br><blockquote>  Stanny: <br>  February 10, 2008/1: 06 am <br>  xax, yes </blockquote><br><br><blockquote>  kornet: <br>  February 11, 2008/10: 25 pm <br>  it certainly pleases </blockquote><br><br>  <strong>Poking up.</strong>  These comments are left by Spamerus Debilius.  It is also a primitive form, but with a slightly better disguise due to, allegedly, compliance with the topic of the post. <br><br><blockquote>  Serch: <br>  February 15, 2008/10: 10 am <br>  yes, nice  but prices are very expensive there </blockquote><br><br>  xxax: <br>  February 6, 2008/6: 13 pm <br>  Yes, such efficiency deserves respect. I just wanted to order a phone for myself, I can even order there! <br><br>  <strong>Licking.</strong>  The sense of licking is for a blogger to leave a comment in which he is so thankful or praised.  Here is a professional lizun, a representative of the species Spamerus Oralis, spy-profi walked through several blogs: <br><br><blockquote>  spy-profi: <br>  February 29, 2008/8: 43 pm <br>  Amazing article, I liked it!  Thanks to the author! </blockquote><br><br><blockquote>  spy-profi said <br>  February 29th, 2008 at 23:07 <br>  Amazing article, I liked it!  Thanks to the author! </blockquote><br><br><blockquote>  Evseev Says: <br>  February 28th, 2008 at 23:04 <br>  cool  1000 readers is a really great achievement! </blockquote><br><br><blockquote>  Maslov Alex Says: <br>  March 6th, 2008 at 3:02 <br>  Yes, I would like to have such an audience of 1000 readers </blockquote><br><br>  <strong>Support Group.</strong>  This type of commentary spun off from the previous one and mutated.  A spamer like Spamerus Commentarius Analis now pretends not to be an admirer, but a like-minded person. <br><br><blockquote>  Alexander Mukhin <br>  I agree))) each frog praises its own swamp. And the main thing on the sweeper's brush is not to trash the blog </blockquote><br><br>  <strong>The beginnings of intelligence.</strong>  This is a more or less well-disguised spamming bot, Spamerus Mozgodolbius.  Sometimes even normal comments come across that can be left.  But the link - remove. <br><br><blockquote>  dnu: <br>  March 7, 2008/9: 28 pm <br>  The online store is certainly good, but I prefer to look ‚Äî touch ‚Äî touch ‚Äî press, let alone make a purchase, since the purchase of a phone is not such a frequent purchase.  and if at the same time you also win in price, and by a substantial amount, then I‚Äôm for nothing, not a virtual store. </blockquote><br><br>  <strong>Start a discussion.</strong>  This form of comments is one of the most effective.  If the conversation ensued, especially with the blogger, then almost always the spamming link remains untouched.  Usually, open questions are used for this purpose (we read psychology).  Here the blog owner responds to the call of the spammer: <br><br><blockquote>  Evseev said <br>  March 2nd, 2008 at 00:32 <br>  You took a better picture of yourself ... and threw it on the site ... otherwise she bought it, but where is the proof? </blockquote><br><br><blockquote>  Anna Matochkina said <br>  March 6th, 2008 at 23:50 <br>  Evseev, and I filmed myself :) Not a webcam, but specifically for the blog. </blockquote><br><br>  Splog belongs not to Evseev, but to one advanced spammer.  He also owns dozens of similar "personal blogs about life and everything."  Please note, an imitation of a man by the name of Evseev worked here. <br><br>  <strong>Cretan discussion.</strong>  Surprisingly, sometimes this works, bloggers even try to explain something, it looks funny. <br><br><blockquote>  Andrey Kornev <br>  micromarketing is an ambiguous concept, explain which side you mean? </blockquote><br><br>  <strong>Clinical cases.</strong>  This is already from my blog.  The comment did not last half an hour, the search engines would never see it. <br><br><blockquote>  Gon <br>  Why are you so attached to spammers ?!  By the way, people earn good money!  so what if you have a couple of spamming comments on your blog? .. yes, blah, if I wrote ‚Äúoh, what a cool site‚Äù !!!  I delete such ones myself!  this is already arrogance ... have you never dealt with doorways ?!  if not then it is very vain!  got like you !!!  spam is bad!  spam is evil!  how are we going to fight !!!  yes fuck you need it ?!  you will not change anything!  it's just easy money enough ... and everyone loves easy money! </blockquote><br><br><h2>  Bloggers and spammers </h2><br><br>  For some, good news, for others - bad.  I finished work on the plugin for WordPress and the service.  A narrow circle of people will be allowed access for testing.  After testing, the plugin and service will be available to everyone. <br><br><h2>  <a href="http://blog.micromarketing.ru/uncategorised/spammers-suck/">What the plugin does</a> </h2><br><br><h3>  Thanks </h3><br>  <a href="http://mzz.ru/" rel="external">Ivan Kurnosov (zerkms)</a> - for patient answers to my questions about MySQL. <br>  <a href="http://lessio.ru/" rel="external">Alexey Molov (lessio)</a> - for patient answers to my questions on PHP. <br>  <a href="http://saahov.ru/" rel="external">Andrei Serebryakov (saahov)</a> - for participating in the compilation of a list of spammers. <br>  <a href="http://studiomade.ru/" rel="external">Studio Made</a> is my studio, our <a href="http://blog.studiomade.ru/" rel="external">studio blog is</a> one of the first to be armed with a new plugin. <br><br>  If you want, you can try <a href="http://blog.studiomade.ru/kitchen/life/let-there-be-light/">this post here</a> , using as links, for example, gagastogo.com or russianpropert.cn - you will see the work of the <a href="http://parasite-eliminator.ru/">Parasite Eliminator</a> plug-in in action. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/288734/">https://habr.com/ru/post/288734/</a></p>
