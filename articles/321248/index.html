      Today our guest is Nikolai Grigoriev. <br><br>  Nikolay works in the game department of the All-Russian State Television and Radio Broadcasting Company, in <a href="http://i-mult.ru/">the Interactive Mult</a> publishing house as a leading developer - an architect of children's mobile games and applications. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>What do you do in the company?</b> <br><br>  I select technologies for the implementation of stories, plan seams and interfaces in the code for the parallel work of the team.  As far as possible, I bring up the manual according to the guidelines in Robert Martin's ‚ÄúIdeal Programmer‚Äù. <br><br>  I propagandize dependency injection only through the constructor and work on git-flow / gitlab-flow. <br><br>  <b>One word that best describes how you work:</b> <br><br>  Directing. <br><br>  <b>How many hours a day do you spend on work?</b> <br><br>  From 8 to 12, if you count the work is not at the computer.  Some tasks are very intrusive and do not let go after leaving the office. <br><br>  <b>How many hours do you sleep?</b> <br><br>  From six to seven, the last time I try to stabilize at eight o'clock. <br><br>  <b>How do you have breakfast?</b> <br><br>  The fact that you can quickly cook: usually brew porridge in milk and make coffee. <br><br>  <b>What are you doing on the way to / from work?</b> <br><br>  I try not to think about anything intensely, turn on the music.  For a quality solution of work issues, you need to immerse yourself in the process as much as possible, so I relax before coming to the office. <br><br>  <b>What kind of todo-manager do you use personally?</b> <br><br>  I personally use only GitLab and keep.google.com.  In GitLab there is a versioning of documents and tasks, markdown markup. <br><br>  <b>What applications and services can't you do without?</b> <br><br>  Git - our everything (GitLab, GitHub), also often at hand I keep: online validator JSON, drive.google and music.google. <br><br>  <b>What kind of task manager / issue tracker / repository do you use in the company?</b> <br><br>  In the company, fortunately, we work in JIRA, in conjunction with various CI modules.  The repository is a local GitLab. <br><br>  <b>What other tools and software do you use at work?</b> <br><br>  In my opinion, Visual Studio + ReSharper is the most powerful tool for working with code.  For everything else, there is Sublime Text.  Also on the work computer are traditionally 5-10 versions of Unity3D.  Some time ago I mastered SmartGIT, threw out the sourceTree and have no regrets. <br><br>  <b>Does the company have internal projects?</b> <br><br>  We have an infrastructure development direction designed to make life easier for employees, some of their products are successfully used in projects under my leadership. <br><br>  <b>What annoys you most when you work?</b> <br><br>  In real work, the worst thing is when you work without all the necessary data.  This may be due to the sparingly described history \ task or incomplete \ missing \ inadequate documentation.  I try to deal with this with all my might.  I get very upset when the efficiency of a team of programmers falls due to the fact that they have to invent behavior themselves, I try to organize the work of programmers so that they have all the necessary ingredients. <br><br>  <b>What professional literature would you recommend?</b> <br><br>  Depending on the level and known technology of the reader: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/22104901/">‚ÄúDeploying dependencies in .NET‚Äù</a> , Mark Siman; </li><li>  <a href="https://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/5011068/">Clean Code</a> , Robert Martin; </li><li>  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Unity-iOS-Essentials-Robert-Wiebe/dp/1849691827">Unity iOS Essentials</a> , Robert Wiebe. </li></ul><br>  <b>What do you prefer: electronic reading rooms or paper books?</b> <br><br>  Paper books, if used as a reference.  PDF on PC, if I use for one-time \ selective reading. <br><br>  <b>What technique and why do you prefer at work and at home?</b> <br><br>  I like the control and availability of calibration to increase efficiency, so I have a PC with Windows 10 at home, devices with MIUI Android with root access.  I use the same approach at work and demand from subordinates. <br><br>  <b>What do you listen when you work?</b> <br><br>  When I write code, the only thing that really increases efficiency is the sound of rain.  Everything else is distracting.  When I don‚Äôt write code: I generate radio in music.google based on Russian or British rock. <br><br>  <b>Which life hack allows you to be more efficient?</b> <br><br>  Once I analyzed my replays of games from Starcraft 2 and noticed that apm and the number of victories correlate with the type of chair I sit on, has since begun to study this question. <br><br>  It turned out that personally, my performance drops with incorrect posture and (unexpectedly) the presence of wheels on the legs of a chair.  Since then I have been sitting on simple stable chairs and periodically unsuccessfully trying to refute this theory. <br><br>  <b>What kind of professional advice for the future can you give yourself?</b> <br><br>  Constantly develop, do not linger on some technologies, analyze the market yourself, know your ship. <br><br>  <b>What would you recommend to a person trying to go the same way?</b> <br><br>  You are well done and have chosen a very exciting and intensive development path, it will not let you get bored.  Do not stop and move forward. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/321248/">https://habr.com/ru/post/321248/</a></p>
