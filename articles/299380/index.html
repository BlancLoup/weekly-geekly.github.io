  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Messengers - "new black"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I admit, since February of this year, the possibility of instant messengers, as new PR platforms, have captured not only my imagination, but also part of the time.  I am an active Telegram user as a subscriber and as a content creator - I have my own educational channel.  But first things first. <br><br>  The fact that brands need instant messengers started in early 2015.  Why is that?  Let's start with the quality of the audience.  First, the mobile audience has money.  The second, almost phenomenal targeting capabilities (location, purchases, search queries and even the removal of physiological data (in perspective). And finally, instant messengers are perhaps the shortest way from acquaintance with a brand to purchase. <br><br>  At the front of the technological flank, as usual - Japan, South Korea, China.  There are some favorites to forget about the existence of the web as an entity.  Order food, taxi, tickets, book and pay for hotels, read the news, play, call and send messages - all this without going beyond the limits of one messenger.  In the West, and even with us it is stricter: there are instant messengers for calls, there is for secret correspondence, there is for communicating with relatives, and there is for contacting with colleagues.  The main thing is not to confuse. <a name="habracut"></a>

      But it is right now.  In the case of such explosive growth (which can be compared, perhaps, only with the recent era of the emergence of social networks) I want to understand where everything is moving and how it will develop.  It became known that Google in the mode of strict secrecy is developing a mobile chat application based on artificial intelligence technology.  In the summer, they even wrote that corporation scientists developed an online robot that, based on an analysis of the dialogues from films, tries to communicate with people. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/df4/b1c/7c0/df4b1c7c0b744eecdf9047cc4ea55a60.gif"><br><br>  This is all, of course, entertaining, but for us in marketing and PR, numbers are most important.  In February, the messenger of Pavel Durov Telegram reached 100 million monthly users. <br>  WhatsApp‚Äôs audience is 1 billion, and Facebook Messenger just recently reached 800 million. <br>  Fine.  And what about us?  In total, according to estimates of J'son &amp; Partners Consulting, almost 60% of smartphone owners use mobile messengers in Russia, which is 50-60 million people.  WhatsApp and Viber are fighting for primacy in our market - their monthly active audience is about 30-50 million people.  Next, with a large margin followed by Skype, Facebook Messenger and others. <br><br>  Here we are finally close to the basic question ‚Äúwhat to do about it?‚Äù Depends on the messenger. <br><br>  For example, Viber allows advertisers to pay for branded sets of stickers that users install on smartphones.  In addition, the messenger has public chat rooms in which brands can communicate with their audience (for this, it‚Äôs enough on your website to provide a link to this group).  This will be especially true if you work with an audience from the regions - the user will be easier and more familiar to use the messenger. <br><br>  Facebook Messenger plans to allow publishers and official media to share news.  Already this April, the company will present a tool for distributing news content.  In addition, it has recently become known that Facebook is discussing with the airlines the display of announcements of tourist flights, well, but about the integration with Uber I have not heard only a deaf and blind person or a person who is far from the industry. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/7a9/56a/85b/7a956a85bb51295153894afdf63e8ee1.gif"><br><br>  Telegram in Russia does not have such a wide audience (1% of application users), like WhatsApp and Viber, but perhaps the most attractive features are bots, information channels, groups, and an open license that allows using and modifying its code. <br><br>  Just recently, the news passed that Tinkoff Bank created an unofficial client by connecting the MoneyTalk code and the Telegram code.  Forbes (American) launched a bot that answers readers' questions and sends information on request.  Bot "Medusa" is able to show the latest news, popular news, search for information on the site, and also gives on request random material about cats.  The Sberbank bot provides information on branches, ATMs, exchange rates and bank contacts.  And haha!  Boat "Mail of Russia" allows you to get information about tariffs and services, and they also say that it is smart.  Creating a bot takes up to 4 weeks, and the cost of development ranges from 50 to 500 thousand rubles. <br><br>  But one thing, forecasts and other people's cases, and another own experience.  Since mid-February I have subscribed to the popular and interesting thematic channels in Telegram - Yuri Saprykin about culture, Grisha Prorokov about science and technology, NeuroScienceRu about neuroscience, etc., and also created my own PR channel about methods of promotion in the digital environment. and is ready to share impressions both from the side of the user and from the part of the PR-specialist. <br><br>  As a consumer of information, I am absolutely delighted, I have practically left the other sites and for a month now I have received my necessary information minimum from the messenger.  Why did this happen?  A minimum of superfluous information noise, lack of advertising, a format conducive to concise and clear language, as well as stickers and gif-animation.  This is an ode to minimalism.  And yes, I feel that this is the future. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/fa9/e4e/e9a/fa9e4ee9a4e3bcb5e946e81b1f71f737.gif"><br><br>  From the point of view, a specialist in promoting me cannot but rejoice at the good organic growth of the audience of channels and the characteristics of its coverage.  Attention drum roll.  For each individual post, the average percentage of coverage ranges from 60 to 90% of the channel audience.  Here, however, it should be noted that the audience of the most popular channels in Telegram today is several thousand users, but just think about the extent of its loyalty (even if you turn off the sound alert, the phone will notify you about the update by vibration), in addition, the number of messenger users in Russia continues to grow.  Mark Zuckerberg himself predicted an increase in the number of Telegram users to 5 billion people by 2030. <br><br>  And returning to the original question of this review, I think we must take it.  For all promotion specialists, instant messengers are the new black.  And I also want to remind you about the ‚Äúpioneer effect‚Äù, today any integration of a brand with messengers is a suitable information guide, whether it be a launch of a bot or another kind of integration.  So, let's not miss this wonderful moment. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299380/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299380/</a></p>
