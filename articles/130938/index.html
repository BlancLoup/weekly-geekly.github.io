  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How does knowing MVP help save a startup time and effort?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In my opinion, every start-up should know and at least partially use the elements of MVP in their projects.  This article highlights the highlights of MVP, knowledge of which will save you time, nerves and money. <br><br>  What is MVP and why is it so good?  The answer to this question is below, but let's start with the fact that many of us are faced with such a dilemma: ‚ÄúThere is a great idea, but you need a lot of time and money to implement.‚Äù  Perhaps a couple of days this idea does not leave your mind, but then you understand your impotence, and that‚Äôs all.  But things could be different ... <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  First you need to understand how good and viable your idea.  Maybe she's only good for the one person you are.  To do this, it is necessary to conduct an independent survey and see existing competitors. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      Competitors, albeit indirect, should be.  It is unlikely that this idea only occurred to you.  If no competitors could be found, then there are three options: you were not looking well, your idea was brilliant or your idea was so utopian that no one undertook to implement it in any form.  You decide. <br><br>  It is better to conduct a survey on strangers, because  friends will not want to go against your vision and most likely you will hear: ‚ÄúYes, very much nothing.  Do it.  It is very difficult to tell a person his face if it is radically different from his opinion. <br><br>  You can make a simple dummy site and catch up with people through contextual advertising.  This will give you an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat order of conversion, what users want to see, what they are interested in.  Do not ask people ‚ÄúWhat do you want?‚Äù, Most people literally do not know what they want.  Instead, offer several options and see which option is most interesting. <br><br>  So, the first step is done.  It is clear that the idea has the right to life.  We must take and do.  This is where MVP knowledge will help us. <br><br>  The concept of MVP (minimum viable product) is a product with minimal functionality that will give an understanding of whether there is demand for it.  A product that can be made fairly quickly, at no extra cost and immediately test it.  The concept of MVP belongs to the ideology of Lean Startup - a startup that is done with minimal budgets and funds within a reasonable time. <br><br>  A lot of time is spent on the elaboration of all the little things and details, while the main attention should be focused on the basic version of the product with minimal functionality.  Why do too much, if possible, these features are not needed? <br><br>  The product should not have serious, critical bugs, because  this may alienate potential users from your product, which may be, it is even very interesting for them and will mislead you. <br><br>  Start testing as early as possible.  No need to polish all interface elements, no need to think through the turn of each phrase.  Quickly make the most simple product and test it immediately.  After testing, refine and test again, etc.  Only in this way, starting from a small, iterative, it is possible with a rather limited means to make a product that will be properly accepted by the market. <br><br>  Get feedback, correct bugs and errors, but do not rush to implement every proposed feature.  You only need to implement the features that most of your users need.  Very well this idea is reflected in one of the chapters of the book ‚ÄúGetting Real‚Äù from 37Signals. <br><br>  Basics of MVP ideology: <br><ul><li>  Do not make the full version of the product. </li><li>  Make as simple as possible a trimmed product. </li><li>  In the initial version there should not be critical bugs </li><li>  Test as early as possible. </li><li>  Get user feedback </li><li>  Run-test-finish and so many times </li></ul><br>  A few words from my personal experience.  Some time ago we did a project with a friend, which we thought would be in demand and could bring good dividends.  As it turned out later, when the product was completely ready, there is interest in the product, but no one wants to buy. <br><br>  Now I understand that to test demand it was enough to make a simple website with a description, interface sketches, or a simple dummy program, and not a complete finished product, throw a bait and wait.  This would save us 4 months of our strength and nerves spent on the project.  Knowing the basic elements of MVP would allow this to be avoided. <br><br>  Useful resources: <br><ul><li>  For more information about Lean StartUp and MVP, as well as how <a href="http://vimeo.com/21202935">Flikr</a> started: <a href="http://vimeo.com/21202935">vimeo.com/21202935</a> </li><li>  Small presentation: <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/startuplessonslearned/minimum-viable-product">www.slideshare.net/startuplessonslearned/minimum-viable-product</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/130938/">https://habr.com/ru/post/130938/</a></p>
