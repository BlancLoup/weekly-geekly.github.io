      **** <br><br>  It all began according to a fairly standard scheme for a novice freelancer - penny customers, lazy projects, such as fixing javascript-test for SMS.  Fakes of the main pages of social networks and a simple walker for Odnoklassniki for 20 bucks, which knew how to enter the site, collect users and visit their pages. <br>  There are several basic types of software that are used to make money, we will look at them in the following chapters. <br><br>  The first serious project for two thousand carried out one task - copying the contents of the beatport.com baskets from account to account.  Half-day work, without experience - for a day and a half. <br>  Vasya made an order for 3 days, several times delaying the release date, because fresh thoughts were constantly coming to my head, swollen with ideas.  The functionality grew and expanded, filled with Ajax interfaces and dynamic output to the web console, a simple order became a convenient and versatile tool that performs the tasks. <br><br>  At the same time, the FreedomScripts project was founded - Vasya wanted to assemble a team, as in old times he gathered people to co-create card mods, first Halflife 1, and then 2. <br><br>  The people were assembled fairly quickly, but due to the lack of team management skills and even if there were some vague goals that absolutely did not require any kind of organized work, Bob quickly lost the team, but the project remained. <br><br>  A topic appeared in the spirit of ‚Äúwriting on pehepe‚Äù on the forum, regularly raised by ‚Äúan‚Äù -s, which served as advertising of services, a list of reviews and regularly performed the function of attracting new customers. <br><br>  Income grew significantly in just two months and now Vasya was already able to repay the loan, slowly collecting money to pay off the debt, but the issue with his studies remained unresolved.  Suddenly, the summer session that had come up gave Vasya to understand that a cross should be put on such a ‚Äúhigher education‚Äù.  Moreover, there was no money, no time, no desire. <br><br>  Later, Vasily came across in the comments of one site an idea that finally approved the correctness of his choice: ‚ÄúIt is necessary to clearly decide for yourself whether the desire to leave the university is caused, or you can spend this time more efficiently.‚Äù  Paraphrased, but not the point.  It is important that Vasya firmly answered himself - I can. <br><br>  **** <br><br>  The work was going on, the projects from Lazhov were transferred to the category of unique ones - again, no one except the customer needed them, but interesting ones.  There was an order for a fake banking site, a dozen steps pulling all possible information from a naive client, ordered a fake website for a freight agency.  Basically, the income came from the development of software for social networks and the rare moments of its re-sale. <br><br>  Since there were practically no manuals on the network, frameworks and experienced friends were also not available - Vasya wrote everything from scratch.  In addition, he fiercely hated the use of someone else's ready code, which they stuffed him in the offices. <br><br>  The first scripts simply output information line by line on the screen and to a file. <br>  At this stage, we had to dig deeper into the buffer cleaning functions and make a primitive logger that would display messages on the screen in the following way: <br><br>  $ tlog-&gt; log ("text"); <br><br>  Later, it was this class that spawned a universal interface on which all the scripts are written, the editor of the config, the editor of the files and even the admin for two tricky injections of Zeus. <br><br>  Having also collected a class with functions for writing to a file and a class with static helpers, Vasya called it the ‚ÄúAquaScript Framework‚Äù, later reducing it to ASFW. <br><br>  The project development time on this framework, which Vasya improved with almost every order, and sometimes it took more than the actual order, was gradually reduced from noon to a couple of hours.  Positive feedback accumulated, BL grew and, if you do not remember the terrible story of the webmoney, when the Persian was blocked up for six months, life took on meaning and colorful shades. <br><br>  **** <br><br>  Finally, the fierce Siberian winter came. <br>  Vasya repaid the loan ahead of schedule, saving himself from overpayment of 40 thousand, distributed debts, repaired the crumbling Nissan, and moved out from his parents, taking the girl with him. <br>  They conducted adsl-internet, bought some simple furniture, picked up a sick kitten on the street, who later grew into a beautiful and intelligent cat and put a live New Year tree. <br><br>  Happy End <br><br>  In total, a full year and a half of unhurried freelance activity took place on a complete change in living standards and now Vasya is confused by articles such as ‚ÄúFreelance Cons‚Äù, in which they talk about fictional terpilakh characters who are forced to provide support for their products even while lying on a beach lounge chair. <br><br>  FreedomScripts did become the project of the team, and not one person - at the summer session, Vasya met two fellow students, of varying degrees of familiarity with programming, who literally six months later abandoned their work and engaged in the same freelancing. <br>  One of them quite well realized himself as a site developer and worked on Vasya‚Äôs previous work, while the second one installed elevators in buildings and didn‚Äôt know how to program at all.  However, both eventually achieved quite good results in this field, becoming free people with decent earnings. <br>  There is no Lexus at the end of the story and will not be - instead of realizing such mundane desires, typical of the majority and imposed on us by the primitive consumer society, Vasya changed his Nissan to an even older car - Toyota Crown, because he always loved old Japanese cars for their beauty and durability.  Also, considerable sums went to the aid of his parents - only after that Vasya felt truly calm and free. <br><br>  The New Year's morning was greeted at a friend's apartment, where they met the four of them with their girls and spent the whole night learning the GUI on Qt4. <br>  On the way to the kitchen, Vasya stopped at the window, looking at the blindingly white snow covered with the morning sun. <br>  Mentally looking back - he realized that all external stimuli - work, "study", loans and problems with the car - were left behind.  And now nothing holds him back on the path to a happy and beautiful future, which is to be built with his own hands. <br><br>  PS <br>  In the following chapters, I will list the types of existing software and give a brief explanation of each of them, after which I plan to start talking about the framework itself. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/109230/">https://habr.com/ru/post/109230/</a></p>
