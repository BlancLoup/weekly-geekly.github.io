They can not always shift them to their product.  <a href="https://blog.prototypr.io/so-your-boss-doesn-t-believe-in-user-research-40d8128db08e">Laura Martini makes the correct analogy</a> : accountants do not say they earn money by filling in the tables of incomes and arrivals, and personnel officers say that they get money for calls and letters to candidates;  they talk about business value - healthy finances and strengthening teams, respectively.  It is better to translate the pain of users into the language of business, rather than continue to argue - then everyone will be happy.

      One example is the <a href="http://www.dmi.org/%3FDesignValue">Design Value Index</a> .  This is the capitalization index of companies investing in design - in 2015 it grew by 211% more than the S &amp; P 500 stock index. <br><br> <a href="http://www.dmi.org/%3FDesignValue"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4bd/0f3/4f0/4bd0f34f0498396fbbacb601811ca7f8.png" alt="Design Value Index, 2015 &amp; copy;  DMI" width="600" height="370"></a> <br>  <i>Design Value Index, 2015 ¬© <a href="http://www.dmi.org/%3FDesignValue">DMI</a></i> <br><br>  Not really.  Bloomberg compared the American Customer Satisfaction Index and the market dynamics of 190 leading companies - the <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-12-17/proof-that-it-pays-to-be-americas-most-hated-companies">opposite is true</a> . <br><br> <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-12-17/proof-that-it-pays-to-be-americas-most-hated-companies"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/db9/472/a89/db9472a89520b0b91e3fb2e3b2e894dd.png" alt="Bloomberg: A Comparison of American Customer Satisfaction Index and Market Dynamics of 190 Leading Companies" width="628" height="500"></a> <br>  <i>Comparison of American Customer Satisfaction Index and market dynamics of 190 leading companies ¬© <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-12-17/proof-that-it-pays-to-be-americas-most-hated-companies">Bloomberg</a></i> <br><br>  In fact, both are right index.  In a competitive B2C market, product and service quality is very important for market success.  But if sales are little dependent on the end-user opinion (monopolistic industries, government services, corporate software with centralized procurement), other patterns work.  In addition, investments in product quality are aimed at the long term, they will not show a quick result. <br><br>  Therefore, it is not enough to refer to the success of other companies - their business may work on other principles.  You need to soberly assess the current situation and understand where the design can benefit the business.  Otherwise, you will remain a pixel engine or a toy in the hands of management. <br><br>  Solving business problems is the main task of designers after the most basic - assistance in product development.  Companies, of course, it is important how well we do our work - the design should not delay the launch of products and their updates to the market, and its quality should be decent.  But this is only a small piece.  It is even better if designers help businesses make better product decisions.  Or even find new opportunities for growth. <br><br>  This is what will allow the design team to become not just a performer and advance along the maturity model from operational (how well a specialist does his job) and tactical levels (how well the product production process is built) to strategic (where and how successfully the company develops).  In the end - to influence what the company is doing and why. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/393/07c/e05/39307ce05182106902fd1c5aefad612f.png" alt="UX Maturity Model.  Strategic level" width="640" height="500"><br><br><h3>  Design should solve business problems </h3><br>  Designers often complain that they are not attracted to the work of defining a product.  Requirements come from managers and they just draw pictures.  Somewhere this is due to the immaturity of the company and management, somewhere - the weakness and short-sightedness of the designers themselves. <br><br>  Start with yourself - you need to increase the credibility of the design team and not leave tails, solving basic problems at the operational and tactical levels (I have written enough about this in 2-4 parts).  But if you want to influence the product - fight!  It is important to show and prove the value of design - we know a lot about users, and this is important for product managers to make decisions.  Then you will be invited not only for the production of models and prototypes.  WeWork's Bobby Ghoshal says that <a href="http://blog.invisionapp.com/inside-design-wework/">80% of design decisions are taken out of pixels</a> ‚Äî in discussions, presentations, meeting meetings, and so on.  - and it is important to be able to argue your ideas. <br><br>  <a href="http://melissaperri.com/2016/01/17/pmvsux/">Melissa Perri</a> and <a href="http://tynerblain.com/blog/2016/04/12/product-owner-manager/">Scott Sehlhorst</a> show that the product manager and designer overlap in many ways.  Some of this concerns quite familiar design artifacts that designers have been successfully making for a long time.  But the most important thing is user problems.  To be able to find them, assess the importance for customers (goals, context, motivation and opportunities) and the business itself (product strategy, competition, organizational potential, etc.), and as a result - the ability to offer and visualize the future in which the problem is solved - here are the key growth points for a design team aiming for a mature UX. <br><br> <a href="http://melissaperri.com/2016/01/17/pmvsux/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e76/e82/414/e76e82414f795cbf7bbbf63acdcc754f.jpg" alt="Melissa Perri: Common Languages ‚Äã‚Äãand Designers and Product Managers" width="780" height="585"></a> <br>  <i>Common language and problems ¬© <a href="http://melissaperri.com/2016/01/17/pmvsux/">Melissa Perri</a></i> <br><br>  In a mature company with cross-functional teams, designers help product managers make decisions.  Where and what?  Imagine an idealized process of working on a product: <br><br><ol><li>  <strong>Product hypothesis</strong> .  Search for unresolved user problems that our product could close to increase business performance. </li><li>  <strong>Preliminary validation</strong> .  Analytical assessment of how demanded and commercially such a product can be. </li><li>  <strong>Design and development</strong> .  Production of a product or functionality at the right time and quality. </li><li>  <strong>Testing the solution</strong> .  Preliminary assessment of how the product is suitable for the target audience. </li><li>  <strong>Distribution of the product</strong> .  Attracting users through different channels and markets, possibly with different promises and values.  Plus the organization of the seamless transition of the user between the channels. </li><li>  <strong>Feedback from the market and users</strong> .  The actual assessment of the product and the introduction of changes to it, whether it is the implementation details, the possibilities or the concept / target audience as a whole. </li><li>  <strong>User support</strong>  Solving problems arising from the use of the product, with which users contact support services, social networks and other channels of communication with the company. </li></ol><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9ef/035/562/9ef0355624fcb413c0f1370cfe1f533b.png" alt="The idealized process of working on a product or functionality" width="780" height="183"><br>  <i>The idealized process of working on a product or functionality</i> <br><br>  The model of developing products and their new functions over the past 10‚Äì15 years has become increasingly dynamic, so this scheme is rather arbitrary - full of both more iterative and more conservative examples.  In addition, in the real world, the first stages are often shortened to the finished product plan.  But this does not change the essence. <br><br> <a href="https://jasonevanish.com/2011/11/27/the-lean-product-life-cycle/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/66e/731/24e/66e73124e85a8495bb880b5f7f63fc8d.jpg" width="500" height="446"></a> <br>  <i>Lean model of the product or functionality ¬© <a href="https://jasonevanish.com/2011/11/27/the-lean-product-life-cycle/">Jason Evanish</a></i> <br><br>  If along the entire chain, designers will always remember why the company solves specific problems and how these decisions affect the business, the focus will shift from project artifacts and methods to product work.  And finally, we will not only solve development problems, but will influence key business indicators and, perhaps, even introduce innovative ideas.  This transformation of the role of designers consists of three stages: <br><br><ol><li>  Assistance in finding and solving business and user problems. </li><li>  Evaluation of maximum exhaust when solving problems. </li><li>  Transition from problem solving to innovation </li></ol><br><h2>  Step 1. Help in finding and solving problems. </h2><br>  If we take product development beyond the brackets, then the product team and its manager have three main tasks: <br><br><ol><li>  Find unsolved user problems (problem space) </li><li>  Understand what and how to do to solve a problem (solution space) </li><li>  Assess how well the problem is solved (how to develop the product) </li></ol><br>  <strong>They can be represented as a ‚Äúproblem ‚Üí solution ‚Üí validation‚Äù chain.</strong>  <strong>The product team will go through it more efficiently with the help of tools that UX-specialists have.</strong>  Many companies are beginning to integrate designers from the last stage, organizing the process of usability testing - it is relatively simple, and the exhaust is immediately clear.  But if you join in all three, you can dramatically increase the value of the work of designers. <br><br><h3>  1. Find unresolved user problems </h3><br>  One of the ways to launch new products and develop existing ones is to go from the still unsolved problems of users.  If the potential audience is large enough and there are prospects for monetization, the company can offer them a suitable product.  What the product manager does in this case: <br><br><ul><li>  <strong>Market assessment</strong> (capacity in money and audience, main competing products, typical business models, growth prospects, domain map). </li><li>  <strong>Competitor research</strong> (market share, business models, product functionality, marketing). </li><li>  <strong>Functional matrix</strong> (comparison of functions that are in competing products). </li><li>  <strong>Evaluation of the target audience</strong> (segmentation, preferences, expectations, problems, solvency). </li><li>  <strong>Building a business model</strong> . </li></ul><br>  The advantage does not always come from the product itself (somewhere a competitive struggle is won by a cheaper price or new distribution channels; someone starts with technology).  But if the matter is still in him, then the design team can greatly help the product manager: <br><br><ol><li>  <strong>Research users and their needs</strong> .  Ethnographic research, interviews, surveys, diaries, focus groups, work with analytics will give a lot of useful information about the importance of problems and features of the target audience (segments, behavior, motivation, context, mental and consumption patterns, expectations, fears and prejudices). </li><li>  <strong>Analysis of competing products</strong> .  Comparative usability testing, expert and heuristic evaluation and user research methods from the previous paragraph.  They will show how well problems are solved by other companies in the market and that users find particularly important. </li></ol><br>  To formalize user problems, the <a href="http://jobstobedone.org/">Jobs to Be Done</a> method is increasingly used.  <a href="https://www.intercom.com/books/jobs-to-be-done">Intercom</a> and James Kalbach <a href="https://www.intercom.com/books/jobs-to-be-done">are writing a lot</a> about digital products about it now.  <a href="https://jtbd.info/replacing-the-user-story-with-the-job-story-af7cdee10c27">Job stories</a> show what life situations cause problems for users (functional, emotional, social) for which they are ready to pay.  A similar approach to finding and describing potential problems is <a href="https://medium.com/hubspot-product/designing-for-anxieties-8a229052b45a">described by HubSpot</a> . <br><br> <a href="https://jtbd.info/replacing-the-user-story-with-the-job-story-af7cdee10c27"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ea7/b31/7f4/ea7b317f484bf7ad572fa156ef293420.png" alt="Job story by Alan Klement" width="780" height="312"></a> <br>  <i>Job story ¬© <a href="https://jtbd.info/replacing-the-user-story-with-the-job-story-af7cdee10c27">Alan Klement</a></i> <br><br> <a href="https://blog.intercom.io/mattresses-using-jobs-done-research-software/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/975/cfc/bea/975cfcbea1382dd498955a8c607a796c.png" alt="Model Intercom Jobs to Be Done: 4 forces" width="780" height="579"></a>  Model Jobs to Be Done: 4 forces ¬© <a href="https://blog.intercom.io/mattresses-using-jobs-done-research-software/">Intercom</a> <br><br> <a href="https://blog.intercom.io/mattresses-using-jobs-done-research-software/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4b0/173/6ec/4b01736ec86b3ebc37c7b419c7c38c50.png" alt="Intercom's Jobs to Be Done Model: Life Cycle" width="780" height="512"></a> <br>  <i>Model Jobs to Be Done: Life Cycle ¬© <a href="https://blog.intercom.io/mattresses-using-jobs-done-research-software/">Intercom</a></i> <br><br> <a href="https://experiencinginformation.wordpress.com/2016/10/23/a-practical-model-for-jobs-to-be-done-jtbd/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a0e/149/10f/a0e14910f780285e4066c4e7192db61f.png" alt="Model Jobs to Be Done by James Kalbach" width="650" height="517"></a> <br>  <i>Model Jobs to Be Done ¬© <a href="https://experiencinginformation.wordpress.com/2016/10/23/a-practical-model-for-jobs-to-be-done-jtbd/">James Kalbach</a></i> <br><br>  Jobs to be Done are also a way to segment users according to their needs.  Previously, designers used characters for this, but this tool has recently lost its former glory - few people use them effectively throughout the work on the product, and not just at the beginning.  In addition, JTBD has a clear focus on problems, while characters often spend a lot of time describing personal characteristics, moreover, taken from the head, not from user research.  Problems are easier to use as a filter for subsequent product decisions.  Although the characters are still well pumped empathy to their users from the grocery team.  And if the segmentation of the audience of the product is quite clear, the characters in conjunction with JTBD will be an excellent tool. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.businessmodelgeneration.com/canvas/vpc">Value Proposition Canvas</a> facilitates the similar task of linking the description of a user's portrait and his problems.  This approach shows how a business plans to solve user problems through providing value to them. <br><br> <a href="https://strategyzer.com/canvas/value-proposition-canvas"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2aa/e06/e11/2aae06e118ebb2efbf6f9f899a137967.jpg" alt="The Value Proposition Canvas framework by Alexander Osterwalder" width="780" height="551"></a> <br>  <i>The Value Proposition Framework Canvas ¬© <a href="https://strategyzer.com/canvas/value-proposition-canvas">Alexander Osterwalder</a></i> <br><br>  A good tool for a more detailed analysis of user problems is the customer travel map (product interaction map) and the experience map (a more abstract process of solving a life problem).  This is the language of designers, which is useful to teach managers (and the most advanced of them have already tried it out).  Although in addition to these two formats, service blueprints are also distinguished (as the company provides service), many experts advise not to be killed about semantic accuracy and pattern matching - the main thing is for the card to help in its work. <br><br> <a href="http://www.macadamian.com/2014/02/28/introduction-to-customer-experience-maps/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/29a/eeb/7af/29aeeb7afd1c2c83c32756374e73e180.jpg" alt="Customer Journey Map by Macadamian" width="780" height="558"></a> <br>  <i>Customer Journey Map ¬© <a href="http://www.macadamian.com/2014/02/28/introduction-to-customer-experience-maps/">Macadamian</a></i> <br><br> <a href="http://www.bethkyle.com/portfolio-item/pregnancy-experience-map/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/04d/3d6/05b/04d3d605bdd9137970689e627c14c6cf.png" alt="Experience Map by Beth Kyle" width="790" height="611"></a> <br>  <i>Experience Map ¬© <a href="http://www.bethkyle.com/portfolio-item/pregnancy-experience-map/">Beth Kyle</a></i> <br><br>  Such cards show how the user solves his problem now (in a particular product and outside of binding to it), noting the key stages of this scenario, as well as positive and problematic places in them.  They may include the full cycle of the client‚Äôs purchase of the product from its awareness of the product to active use and recommendations to friends, or interaction with a separate large piece of service.  If we are talking about a new product of the company, the map will help to present its main functions;  if about existing - will show the bottlenecks, the solution of which will allow to develop it.  Moreover, the card affects both the digital product and accompanying services in other channels of user interaction (including offline).  And this is a deep look at the problem, giving even more useful information for decision-making. <br><br>  The interaction map does not have to be complex and spectacular, as in the examples above.  The main thing is that it helps to visualize user problems. <br><br> <a href="https://blog.prototypr.io/design-for-the-feedback-you-want-1a65d58ff74f"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1c9/020/b46/1c9020b4672646e89b70d0904908281c.png" alt="Customer Journey Map in a simplified version of Shopify" width="780" height="455"></a> <br>  <i>Customer Journey Map in a simplified version ¬© <a href="https://blog.prototypr.io/design-for-the-feedback-you-want-1a65d58ff74f">Shopify</a></i> <br><br>  True, exhaust depends on the complexity of use cases.  One-page promotional site is better to include in the general map of interaction with the product that it sells - interaction with the landing itself is too primitive.  If the product processes a lot of scenarios, but it is still atomic (for example, an Internet search) - rather complex analytics and behavioral segmentation of users will help. <br><br>  In reality, companies often come from opportunities in the market, quickly launching a product and iteratively developing it, and the understanding of users comes later.  In this case, many angles are cut off and no user studies are performed.  But for successful product growth, the need to understand your customers is important, so the product manager will return to these issues sooner or later.  Moreover, the focus of mature companies is increasingly shifting from solving problems to finding them, and without an understanding of users, these possibilities are limited. <br><br><h3>  2. Understand what and how to do to solve the problem </h3><br>  When the problem is studied well enough, and its importance and value to users is large enough, the product manager needs to offer a product solution for the target audience.  What the product manager does in this case: <br><br><ul><li>  <strong>The vision of the product</strong> (how will we solve the problems of users so that the company has commercial success or achieved other goals). </li><li>  <strong>Product</strong> features (functional set, ranked by value for users and business). </li><li>  <strong>The concept or prototype of the solution</strong> (or several alternatives). </li><li>  <strong>Production, start-up and distribution plan</strong> (is it possible to do the first version right away or, first, you need to check the main hypotheses; what team and resources are needed for this). </li></ul><br>  Here the participation of the design team is more active and we can further help the product manager: <br><br><ol><li>  <strong>Evaluation of user attitudes to the product idea</strong> .  Although at very early stages, when there is not even a prototype, it is difficult for users to assess their interest in the product, there are formats of surveys and interviews in order to probe them. </li><li>  <strong>Hypothesis testing using a prototype solution</strong> .  Creating static and interactive prototypes, pseudo-automated services with manual order processing and a lot of what else - there is a large range of cheap solutions.  After that, testing: qualitative (interview, usability testing) or quantitative (analytics after launching to a small audience, comparing several solutions) and iterative refinement of the prototype. </li></ol><br>  Hypothesis testing is a major place for designers to benefit.  And thanks to the popularization of the practices of design thinking, companies are increasingly ‚Äúthinking with their hands‚Äù, creating prototypes of solutions.  And with the spread of lean approaches, the importance of fast iterative work in the early stages has increased. <br><br>  Although hypotheses are tested at the next stage, they need to be put at the stage of proposing solutions (and the very formulation of the problem is, in fact, a hypothesis).  It is important to understand how we will make sure that the proposed concept really solves the chosen problem of users.  To do this, you need to decide on the experiment: the way of testing (as well as which users will see the concept), the success metrics (which statistically significant data from analytics or user research will confirm the hypothesis) and the minimum set of functions (MVP (minimum viable product): which scenarios the concept should work out ).  In many ways, this is the task of the product manager, but the design team has many methods for testing hypotheses and, in a mature company, is actively involved in the process. <br><br>  <a href="http://eleganthack.com/a-map-from-goals-around-assumptions-through-tasks-towards-results/">An interesting approach to the description of hypotheses</a> suggests John Cutler. <br><br> <a href="http://eleganthack.com/a-map-from-goals-around-assumptions-through-tasks-towards-results/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/879/959/377/8799593776e212d16cb4cd93ab223d85.png" alt="John Cutler's Hypothesis Description Format" width="780" height="557"></a> <br>  <i>Hypothesis Description Format ¬© <a href="http://eleganthack.com/a-map-from-goals-around-assumptions-through-tasks-towards-results/">John Cutler</a></i> <br><br>  Based on this, it is possible to vary the degree of development of the prototype, depending on the hypothesis itself and the process stage: from a rough demonstration of the key steps in the form of block diagrams of screens to a complete customer journey map on real data, including initial training.

In general, everything is exactly the same, but the maximum number of those who do not mean that this approach maximizes the proportion of those who continue to use the product.

Therefore, I note once again that it is important to understand the peculiarities of your company's business, before taking ready-made recipes. <br><br> <a href="http://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-high-price-of-customer-satisfaction/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1ca/0a0/d61/1ca0a0d614b8723364776a42ff01fe8b.jpg" alt="User satisfaction and profitability &amp; copy; Mit sloan" width="504" height="288"></a> <br>  <i>User satisfaction and profitability ¬© <a href="http://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-high-price-of-customer-satisfaction/">MIT Sloan</a></i> <br><br> <a href="http://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-high-price-of-customer-satisfaction/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7ef/58e/78a/7ef58e78ac56bfe9e39c649d5dd282f8.jpg" alt="The importance of user satisfaction for different types of companies &amp; copy; Mit sloan" width="460" height="281"></a> <br>  <i>The importance of user satisfaction for different types of companies ¬© <a href="http://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-high-price-of-customer-satisfaction/">MIT Sloan</a></i> <br><br>  A similar problem with your favorite designers "delightful details", seeking to cause delight and increase loyalty.  The article by Matthew Dixon, Karen Freeman, and Nicholas Toman <a href="https://hbr.org/2010/07/stop-trying-to-delight-your-customers">gives disappointing facts</a> - exceeding expectations, for example, in the form of free delivery or a gift, makes customers little more loyal than just the usual fulfillment of obligations.  If you take two conditional cakes with things that increase and decrease loyalty, respectively - the product and brand will dominate the first (despite the fact that the service takes up a small part of it).  But in the second, the quality of service is the main reason for the negative attitude.  But this is the topic of the next group of metrics. <br><br><h4>  3. The quality of the product </h4><br>  Internal indicators of the stability of the product and the quality of its implementation for all components - functionality, marketing, support.  Indirectly affect the attitude of users to it and, ultimately, the money. <br><br><ul><li>  <strong>Technical stability of work</strong> - how often the service is inoperable and how many users this affects. </li><li>  <strong>Efficiency of use</strong> - how much time and effort does the user have to complete the task in the product? </li><li>  <strong>Quality of support</strong> and <strong>CES</strong> (Customer Effort Score) - how quickly problems of users are solved, whether it is necessary to contact to solve the problem again. </li><li>  <strong>The number of found bugs</strong> - how many errors in the work of the product the user encounters. </li><li>  <strong>Compliance with standards</strong> - whether interface solutions depart from the best practices and checklists of usability, accessibility. </li><li>  <strong>SUS</strong> (System Usability Scale) and <strong>SUPR-Q</strong> (Standardized User Experience Percentile Rank Questionnaire) are standardized methods for assessing usability through 10 questions about working with the product. </li><li>  <strong>SUM</strong> (Single Usability Measure) - combined usability assessment by test results. </li></ul><br>  The integrated usability indicators work well here, which take into account several factors at once.  Either standardized, like <a href="http://www.measuringu.com/sus.php">SUS</a> , <a href="http://www.suprq.com/">SUPR-Q,</a> and <a href="http://www.measuringu.com/SUM/index.htm">SUM</a> , or tailored to the needs of specific companies, like ICU / ICU (Integral Criteria of Usability) from UIDG or TPI (Cisco Task Performance Indicator) from Cisco.  The principles of the latter are well described in the <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/task-performance-indicator-management-metric-for-customer-experience">article Gerry McGovern</a> .  They can be tracked over time in order to assess the improvement in consumer qualities of the product, or to compare with competitors in order to assess competitiveness.  By the way, for the interest you can see the classic integral quality metric RATER (initially <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SERVQUAL">SERVQUAL</a> ) - reliability, assurance, tangibles, empathy, responsiveness. <br><br> <a href="https://alistapart.com/article/task-performance-indicator-management-metric-for-customer-experience"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2f4/fef/bb4/2f4fefbb419e1d3114496aaa6008e576.jpg" alt="Cisco Task Performance Indicator" width="696" height="396"></a> <br>  <i>Cisco Task Task Indicator ¬© <a href="https://alistapart.com/article/task-performance-indicator-management-metric-for-customer-experience">Gerry McGovern</a></i> <br><br>  In the previous group of metrics, I ended up with the fact that the quality of the service is capable of greatly dropping user loyalty.  Harvard Business Review talks about <a href="https://hbr.org/2010/07/stop-trying-to-delight-your-customers">CES (Customer Effort Score)</a> , which affects repeat purchases more than satisfaction and NPS.  It shows how easily the client solved his problem with the product.  Designers need to remember that in addition to the main interface of the product there is support, distribution and other components of interaction with the company that affect the business. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"> <a href="https://hbr.org/2010/07/stop-trying-to-delight-your-customers"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d18/ffa/613/d18ffa613aeb82a73307427b685d09f4.gif" alt="The impact of quality support, NPS, and satisfaction on repeat purchases &amp; copy; HBR" width="360" height="359"></a> </div><br>  <i>The impact of quality support, NPS and satisfaction on repeat purchases ¬© <a href="https://hbr.org/2010/07/stop-trying-to-delight-your-customers">HBR</a></i> <br><br><h4>  4. Market as a whole </h4><br>  Metrics that talk about the long term company.  If there is simply no space for growth, then the overall strategy needs to be changed - otherwise product improvements will bring little benefit. <br><ul><li>  <strong>Market capacity</strong> - an assessment of the solvency of the audience in money. </li><li>  <strong>Competition</strong> - the market share of competitors in percent, as well as an assessment of the growth prospects of each of these companies. </li><li>  <strong>Market saturation</strong> is a potential audience not yet covered by the products of the company and its competitors. </li></ul><br>  As applied to startups, they often talk about the importance of getting a product into the market.  Marc Andreesen writes that a <a href="http://caps.fool.com/Blogs/the-pmarca-guide-to-startups/410455">strong market with a large number of potential customers is able to pull the product out</a> .  He divides the life of a startup into two stages - before entering the market (when it is necessary to adjust the concept, the team and the choice of the market often and quickly) and after (when there is a normal development of the company).  Andy Rachleff says that the main killer of companies is the lack of a market and it doesn‚Äôt matter whether a strong team works in a weak market or a weak one in a strong one - only the market is important. <br><br>  This is also important for mature companies - the market may collapse or become too competitive.  Christina Wodtke gives a <a href="http://eleganthack.com/picking-a-market/">matrix of markets</a> for the importance of customer problems and the frequency of its occurrence: the ocean (it is easy to achieve profitability, although it is important to find your niche), a swamp (many people without special preferences, so you need powerful marketing), a well (high margin, but small volumes) and desert (little chance).  Designers need to understand where the company is located and what problems it will bring to its solution. <br><br> <a href="http://eleganthack.com/picking-a-market/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c2d/e26/836/c2de2683617d0f9b7e1b468c4c46d033.jpg" alt="Market Matrix &amp; copy; Christina wodtke" width="780" height="514"></a> <br>  <i>Market Matrix ¬© <a href="http://eleganthack.com/picking-a-market/">Christina Wodtke</a></i> <br><br><h4>  5. Brand values </h4><br>  In addition to metrics, there are common brand values ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äî principles, a manifesto, and other ways to describe why a company exists.  This is a high-level filter that helps to choose among all initiatives those that are close to the brand in spirit and competence.  And then - and specific solutions to problems.  Otherwise, entry into the market may become too expensive and risky. <br><br>  Erik Roscam Abbing and his company Zilver Innovation <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/brandriveninnovation/brand-driven-innovation-39837653/">consider all initiatives and solutions from the point of view of the brand</a> : <br><br> <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/brandriveninnovation/brand-driven-innovation-39837653/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/edf/68d/a6e/edf68da6ebcf726bf17cf31b18051394.jpg" alt="Innovations from the &amp; copy; brand Zilver Innovation" width="780" height="910"></a> <br>  <i>Innovations coming from the brand ¬© <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/brandriveninnovation/brand-driven-innovation-39837653/">Zilver Innovation</a></i> <br><br>  Take a look at Facebook and Google: who is better at creating devices, and who has social networks? <br><br><h4>  Interconnection of metrics </h4><br>  Between these five groups of metrics is approximately the following link: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c98/6bc/0d0/c986bc0d0ea2f9e31cafb62b1c1905de.png" alt="Chain of metrics" width="780" height="183"><br>  <i>Chain of metrics</i> <br><br>  You can track changes in this chain along three sections: <br><br><ul><li>  <strong>Growth and health indicators</strong> .  How much key metrics have changed during the reporting period.  Their fall speaks of problems, and growth speaks of successful changes in the product. </li><li>  <strong>Comparison with competitors</strong> .  Comparison of indicators and absolute values ‚Äã‚Äãhelp to understand how well the company is competing in the market.  Is there a threat to its current position and whether to push it. </li><li>  <strong>Key milestones</strong> .  Desired absolute values ‚Äã‚Äãof key metrics (for example, monthly active audience).  Overcoming them indicates that a business has reached a certain scale. </li></ul><br>  The first cut is the main working tool.  You set the period for which the metric changes.  Then see what effect the changes in the interface gave.  For example, did the return rate increase in a month or did the number of registrations increase in a week.  Small products need more time for the number of users in the experiment to become statistically significant.  Whatsapp Monster gets about 700 registrations per minute and can conduct tests almost in real time.  By the way, statistical significance is important in all dimensions.  And also a sober assessment of growth opportunities - somewhere an increase of 20% will not be noticeable, but somewhere + 2% will give an explosive effect. <br><br>  It is also useful to have counter-metrics for key indicators - so you make sure that you do not harm the product.  For example, the number of registrations may increase due to a new distribution channel, but the involvement of these users may be too low. <br><br>  It is also necessary to distinguish metrics from signals like the number of page views per day.  They are needed when conducting experiments (for example, whether we began to view the movie page more when adding a link to it on the news page) when we are solving a specific task.  Or if the company's critical indicator is built on such a signal (I gave the above <a href="https://www.quora.com/Growth-Hacking-How-do-you-find-insights-like-Facebooks-7-friends-in-10-days-to-grow-your-product-faster-1">example of Facebook</a> , where a potentially active user adds 10 friends in the first 7 days).  But in any case, our main task is to improve the key indicator and in another experiment we will need other signals.  Therefore, do not give them too much attention, otherwise you will dig in the flow of useless information.  Or even worse - you will start to solve problems like a high failure rate in panic, without understanding <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/return-visits-not-bounce/">the broader picture of the user interaction with the product</a> . <br><br><h3>  How design ideas can get into the product plan </h3><br>  Ultimately, designers want their proposals to fall into the design plan.  True, many have met <a href="https://hbr.org/2015/09/design-for-action">one of the following reactions of the product manager to product development proposals</a> : <br><br><ul><li>  I do not consider this problem critical. </li><li>  These are not the product development opportunities that I am considering. </li><li>  It would be worth exploring other issues altogether. </li><li>  The offer is not very convincing. </li></ul><br>  Common language and problem visualization are part of the answer to such objections.  The second part is participation in the selection of priorities for product development and the preparation of a product plan (roadmap).  It is good when the whole team has access to it and understands the criteria for evaluating the functions falling into it.  This will allow designers to independently check whether their ideas have a chance for implementation. <br><br>  There is no single standard for product plans, but, as a rule, there are two tools: <br><br><ul><li>  <strong><a href="http://svpg.com/assessing-product-opportunities/">A table of product ideas</a></strong> in which each row is assessed by several parameters (impact on key metrics, technical complexity, timeframe and cost of implementation, consumer qualities, volume of potential audience, competition).  Each of the parameters is given its own weight, so that the result is a total score.  The table is sorted by this score. </li><li>  <strong>Roadmap</strong> in the form of a ranked list of specific functions from the table of product ideas.  Depending on the development process, this may simply be backlog (the team takes functions from top to bottom), or a pre-agreed release plan or quarterly plan.  Ideas come here as they are worked out, although many of them will remain ideas. </li></ul><br>  Mature in terms of design, the company takes into account among the parameters of assessment and consumer qualities.  There are several common ways to evaluate them. <br><br>  <strong><a href="https://articles.uie.com/kano_model/">The Kano model</a></strong> allows you to divide product ideas into five categories: attractive (exceed expectations), work efficiency (key characteristics that compare competitors), mandatory (without them, the product cannot be sold), unimportant (do not affect user choice) and negative (in minus product).  The most valuable fall into the upper right corner.  For the evaluation of ideas and the subsequent placement on the scale can be used to survey users. <br><br> <a href="https://articles.uie.com/kano_model/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/12c/167/c31/12c167c31d71fc4ea0e148efdba84737.png" alt="Model Kano &amp; copy; UIE" width="500" height="500"></a> <br>  <i>Model Kano ¬© <a href="https://articles.uie.com/kano_model/">UIE</a></i> <br><br>  <a href="https://hbr.org/2002/01/turn-customer-input-into-innovation"><strong>The window of opportunity</strong></a> helps to assess the potential of product ideas due to the difference between the importance of the problem for the user and satisfaction with the current solution.  The importance and satisfaction are assessed on a 9-point scale, the total score is obtained by the formula ‚Äúimportance + (importance - satisfaction) = window of opportunity‚Äù. <br><br> <a href="https://experiencinginformation.wordpress.com/2016/12/11/combining-mental-model-diagrams-and-jobs-to-be-done/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2ea/30d/4cf/2ea30d4cfb89052ee19c4cf50203c954.png" alt="Calculation principle Opportunity gap &amp; copy; James kalbach" width="780" height="568"></a> <br>  <i>Calculation principle Opportunity gap ¬© <a href="https://experiencinginformation.wordpress.com/2016/12/11/combining-mental-model-diagrams-and-jobs-to-be-done/">James Kalbach</a></i> <br><br>  Evaluation, again, can be done through a user survey.  It is important to correctly describe the product ideas - in terms of the ultimate value for the user.  The most valuable problems for the user fall into the upper left corner: <br><br> <a href="https://experiencinginformation.wordpress.com/2016/12/11/combining-mental-model-diagrams-and-jobs-to-be-done/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/aad/8e2/d58/aad8e2d58517ffa8e3041df3ee45b7d7.png" alt="The most valuable problems &amp; copy; James kalbach" width="779" height="633"></a> <br>  <i>Most Valuable Issues ¬© <a href="https://experiencinginformation.wordpress.com/2016/12/11/combining-mental-model-diagrams-and-jobs-to-be-done/">James Kalbach</a></i> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.measuringu.com/blog/key-drivers.php">Another way to visualize this approach</a> is Jeff Sauro: <br><br> <a href="http://www.measuringu.com/blog/key-drivers.php"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/72e/8e8/07d/72e8e807d7cdd275822ffb84316b34de.jpg" alt="Analysis of key drivers &amp; copy; Jeff sauro" width="500" height="334"></a> <br>  <i>Analysis of key drivers ¬© <a href="http://www.measuringu.com/blog/key-drivers.php">Jeff Sauro</a></i> <br><br>  A great <a href="https://medium.com/%40wnialloconnor/how-to-build-an-experience-map-5e55b7ee4f32">example of passing through the whole chain from finding problems to visualizing and prioritizing them is</a> described by Niall O'Connor. <br><br> <a href="https://medium.com/%40wnialloconnor/how-to-build-an-experience-map-5e55b7ee4f32"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/580/09e/fbf/58009efbf7b02d8cfdd02e7fdd5f38f8.png" alt="A bunch of user and business issues &amp; copy; Niall O‚ÄôConnor" width="780" height="527"></a> <br>  <i>A bunch of user and business issues ¬© <a href="https://medium.com/%40wnialloconnor/how-to-build-an-experience-map-5e55b7ee4f32">Niall O'Connor</a></i> <br><br> <a href="https://medium.com/%40wnialloconnor/how-to-build-an-experience-map-5e55b7ee4f32"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/173/d24/c04/173d24c04638b70fe9081e793269fe34.png" alt="Problem Map with Problem Designation &amp; copy; Niall O‚ÄôConnor" width="780" height="430"></a> <br>  <i>Interaction Map with Problem Designation ¬© <a href="https://medium.com/%40wnialloconnor/how-to-build-an-experience-map-5e55b7ee4f32">Niall O'Connor</a></i> <br><br> <a href="https://medium.com/%40wnialloconnor/how-to-build-an-experience-map-5e55b7ee4f32"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b8a/b1a/b69/b8ab1ab695f95b1c40b3eb7444c92dd0.png" alt="Roadmap with product ideas on key parameters &amp; copy; Niall O‚ÄôConnor" width="780" height="431"></a> <br>  <i>Roadmap with the evaluation of food ideas on key parameters ¬© <a href="https://medium.com/%40wnialloconnor/how-to-build-an-experience-map-5e55b7ee4f32">Niall O'Connor</a></i> <br><br><h3>  Problem visualization </h3><br>  The set of the most important indicators now depends on the type of product, the stage of its life cycle and the market - tracking all possible metrics at once is useless.  When looking for a suitable market, a grocery solution and a business model for its monetization, recurrence is critical - is it valuable enough?  In a period of growing user base and / or profits, it is important to reduce the outflow by optimizing the entire interaction map.  In short, key metrics should answer the right questions about the current state and business plans (there is even the concept of <a href="http://mobiledevmemo.com/minimum-viable-metrics/">Minimum Viable Metrics</a> ).  They can be used in the prism ‚Äúbusiness targets ‚Üí opportunity on the market (user problem or product flaw) ‚Üí solution ‚Üí validation ‚Üí business growth‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/589/269/20d/58926920d8ac3d5067e2bc1ff3870a94.png" alt="Prism to evaluate solutions" width="780" height="183"><br>  <i>Prism to evaluate solutions</i> <br><br>  In order to make work on solving problems more systematic and visual, you can tie key metrics to the interaction map.

At the bank‚Äôs office there is a huge map for the whole wall, on which they mark business objectives and highlight key metrics that can be pumped in various ways.  These analysts are also marked on the map - they help to find ideas for product improvements.  Moreover, the ideas and solutions of competing banks were also noted there.  Concepts and prototypes of new interfaces that solve the selected problem can also be placed here.  The result is a powerful tool for finding problems and choosing the most effective points of application of effort, which is used by the whole team and shows the whole picture of the client's interaction with the company. <br><br>  You can log in on the other hand and use the pirated metrics of <strong><a href="http://www.expectedbehavior.com/experiments/pirate_metrics/">AARRR</a></strong> (Acquisition, Activation, Retention, Revenue, Referral) of Dave McClure - they show the user's life cycle in terms of the effect on business: <br><br><ul><li>  Acquisition (increment of user base, evaluation of channels to attract users) </li><li>  Activation (total number of users, rate of user activation, number of active users) </li><li>  Retention (outflow, NPS, engagement) </li><li>  Revenue (LTV, ARPU, frequency of purchases, time of return on user acquisition costs) </li><li>  Referral </li></ul><br> <a href="http://www.expectedbehavior.com/experiments/pirate_metrics/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ca8/7d8/059/ca87d8059fc0294be8fb8a4391687edb.png" alt="Pirated AARRR metrics &amp; copy; Dave mccleure" width="678" height="444"></a> <br>  <i>Pirated AARRR Metrics ¬© <a href="http://www.expectedbehavior.com/experiments/pirate_metrics/">Dave McClure</a></i> <br><br>  In his book Build Better Products, Laura Klein offers a similar model: <br><br> <a href="http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2016/11/build-better-products.php"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8ac/79b/e7a/8ac79be7a9d30252fc8ac6296b903365.jpg" alt="Funnel of the life cycle of user interaction with the product from Laura Klein" width="474" height="499"></a> <br>  <i>Product Life Cycle Funnel Funnel ¬© <a href="http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2016/11/build-better-products.php">Laura Klein</a></i> <br><br>  Another model that visually represents the health of the product is <strong><a href="http://www.dtelepathy.com/ux-metrics/">HEART</a></strong> (Happiness, Engagement, Adoption, Retention, Task Success) in the prism of ‚Äúgoals ‚Üí signals ‚Üí metrics‚Äù from Google Ventures.

While the routine and not very impressive-looking work on the creation and maintenance of infrastructure often brings people much more benefit.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Real innovations are solutions to complex problems, made commercially successful for the first time. They directly affect the lives of millions of people. Therefore, you need to look in the direction of frequent gradual improvements.

Mailchimp designers have built a powerful knowledge base that combines knowledge of users from a variety of sources (user research, analytics, feedback, research of competitors and the market, etc.), which allows you to quickly get answers to many questions. <br><br> <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/connected-ux"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/228/2ff/52e/2282ff52e6c194740472921455acce8c.jpg" alt="Mailchimp User Knowledge Base" width="474" height="356"></a> <br>  <i><a href="http://alistapart.com/article/connected-ux">Mailchimp</a> User <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/connected-ux">Knowledge Base</a></i> <br><br>  If these opportunities and insights are considered not within the framework of point problems according to the map of user interaction with the product, but in conjunction, i.e.  as an improvement in key scenarios entirely - you can go beyond incremental improvements.  For this, it is important to have a well-coordinated interaction between roles and divisions, because growth points can relate to various parts of the product.  Alex Rawson, Ewan Duncan, and Conor Jones describe <a href="https://hbr.org/2013/09/the-truth-about-customer-experience">many good examples of such system work</a> . <br><br>  In order for such interdisciplinary interaction to be possible, some companies systematically develop a culture of innovation.  Adobe, Intuit and CSAA Insurance Group have created <a href="https://www.fastcodesign.com/3063611/every-company-needs-an-innovation-toolkit">special innovation toolkits for employees</a> who teach methods and practices to search for both incremental improvements and more serious breakthroughs.  Innovations of both types are possible only in companies that have created a suitable culture, one of the key features of which is the ability to try and make mistakes without consequences for a career.  There are many windows of opportunity for designers in this, both in terms of applying research methods and prototyping beyond the usual framework of the interface, and in terms of the development of the culture itself. <br><br><h2>  findings </h2><br>  User research and analytics are powerful decision support tools.  The more such support comes from us, the better the company's solutions and we are more valuable as designers.  And the closer the language of designers to the language of business.  After all, with a common language, it will turn out to ‚Äúmarry‚Äù the goals of business and users.  For product managers, such a language is key business indicators.  For designers - interaction cards. <br><br>  Total: <br><br><ul><li>  Benefit throughout the process of working on the product, not only in its development. </li><li>  It is important to understand not only users, but also the company's business. </li><li>  Consider interface solutions in terms of ‚Äúbusiness targets ‚Üí opportunity on the market (user problem or product flaw) ‚Üí solution ‚Üí validation ‚Üí business growth‚Äù. </li><li>  Clearly show problems in the work of users with the product using the interaction map. </li><li>  Look at innovations more broadly, then the company will be able to issue them more often. </li></ul><br>  You will bring even more good to users when you start to choose interface solutions not only with your heart, but also in accordance with business success indicators.  People vote with a purse and commercial success is a good indicator of the benefits brought. <br><br>  PS It is important not to forget your roots and not turn into a soulless metrics optimization machine.  We need a healthy compromise in the interests of business and user, commerce and aesthetics.  Otherwise, in pursuit of numbers, the quality of the design will fall. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/https://translate" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/326448/">https://habr.com/ru/post/326448/</a></p>
