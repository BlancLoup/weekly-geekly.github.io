The head of the Internet Video Association (among its members are the largest Russian online cinemas), Alexey Birdin, <a href="http://izvestia.ru/news/585631">told</a> the Izvestia newspaper that the copyright holders already have a list of more than 700 sites.  If copyright infringements do not cease, perpetual blocking will be sought for resources from this list. <br><br>  The contents of the list were not disclosed, but for example, 5 resources were named: kinogol.net, bobfilm.net, kinozal.tv, zerx.tv and intv.ru.  Bardeen also declined to say whether Odnoklassniki and VKontakte social networking services are on the list. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  From May 1 of this year, amendments that come under the scope of the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D4%25E5%25E4%25E5%25F0%25E0%25EB%25FC%25ED%25FB%25E9_%25E7%25E0%25EA%25EE%25ED_%25EE%25F2_2_%25E8%25FE%25EB%25FF_2013_%25E3%25EE%25E4%25E0_%25B9_187-%25D4%25C7">Federal Law of July 2, 2013 No. 187-FZ,</a> music, books and software - the so-called ‚Äúextended anti-piracy law‚Äù - <a href="https://megamozg.ru/post/11532/">come</a> into force.  Now it applies only to movies.  Another change is the nature of blocking: the Moscow City Court can recognize the site as a violator, and the Roskomnadzor will transfer the site for uploading to communication service providers.  After a few hours, the site will become unavailable in Russia, but after removing the content-inducing questions, it will also be quickly excluded from the ‚Äúblack list‚Äù.  From May 1, right holders will have the opportunity to block websites that repeatedly violate the law for life.  It is enough that the same company won a court against the same resource twice, and the court can block the site forever. <br><br>  It is not known whether the two strikes of the violation will be taken into account in this calculation until May 1, 2015.  Lawyers of Webkontrol, who filed lawsuits against the Moscow City Court against nnm-film.me, rutor.org, myvi.ru, bobfilm.ru, my-hit.org, kinogo.net, hdkinomax.com, kinozal.tv, tushkan.net, are sure what will be.  The head of the Russian anti-piracy organization (Disney Enterprise, Paramount Pictures Corp., Warner Bros. Entertainment, Sony Pictures, and others) Konstantin Zemchenko admits that the right holders have different opinions on the issue.

      Alexey Birdin said that those resources that compete with legal platforms will be prosecuted first.  In this case, the association "Internet video" will act as a coordinator in the protection of the rights of holders of copyright and blocking "pirated" sites.  ‚ÄúClaims will be filed by copyright holders and contractors who are engaged in anti-piracy activities under powers of attorney from copyright holders,‚Äù says Byrdin.  According to him, the list compiled by the association was formed at once by several large associations of rightholders. <br><br>  Leonid Agronov, general director of the National Federation of the Music Industry (Sony Music, Universal Music, Warner Music and others), said that there are also music companies in his list, but he is far less - 23 resources.  But he, according to Agronov, covers 95% of all illegal downloads and auditions.  Among the sites - rutor.org, primemusic.ru, buffa.ru, claims against them will be among the first.  Agronov also reports that he is ready to accept proposals for the legalization of "pirated" resources. <br><br>  Alexander Akopov, chairman of the Association of Film and Television Producers (it includes Bazelevs, Art Picture, Amedia, Comedy Club Production and other large Russian production companies), says that the "pirates" had enough time to prepare for May 1, and resources will be toughly dealt with by bringing closures: ‚ÄúThe law works in such a way that there is no need for all those whose rights are violated to file complaints on the same site.  The right holders will share this responsibility among themselves, and after May 1, lawsuits will be filed against the main pirate sites. ‚Äù <br><br>  The Federal Law of July 2, 2013 No. 187-FZ ‚ÄúOn Amendments to the Legislative Acts of the Russian Federation on the Protection of Intellectual Rights in Information and Telecommunication Networks‚Äù entered into force on August 1, 2013.  It implies the possibility of blocking websites on which there are unlicensed materials, we are talking about video content.  After non-fulfillment of the requirements by resource operators, the site is blocked by adding the site to the Roskomnadzor‚Äôs ‚Äúblack list‚Äù.  The law <a href="http://rublacklist.net/5773/">caused a</a> great response from the entire Runet, among the companies criticizing it were Yandex, Google, VKontakte, Mail.ru Group, and Wikimedia RU.  <a href="http://b-online.ru/infobusiness/2686-antipiratskiy-zakon-uvelichil-prodazhi-filmov-onlayn-v-2-raza.html">It is believed</a> that the implementation of the law has doubled sales of online video. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/374939/">https://habr.com/ru/post/374939/</a></p>
