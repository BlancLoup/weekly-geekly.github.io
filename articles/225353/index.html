In the arsenal of a competitive intelligence officer must be a variety of skills, including the possession of tools and plug-ins, so the level of hardcore, it was decided to slightly increase.  However, the traditional requirements for deduction and the ability to search for connections have not gone away. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  1.

      According to legend, the player appears as a novice in the <b>Anneximous</b> underground hacker party and is assigned to discover the email address of one of the ATH employees: <br><br><blockquote>  Hi, <br><br>  I heard you wanted to join the Anneximous group.  That's fine but you should not be worth it. <br><br>  Rumor has it that feds are close to us.  Those dumbasses from ATH (Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Hackers and Cookies) must be spying on us! <br><br>  Teach one of the lesson and maybe accept you.  Get his email address. </blockquote><br>  We deliberately left the intro-task simple enough not to scare anyone away.  This task was solved in one request in Google: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/50f/863/809/50f863809e4cfff8648e491dfcd0f960.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Solved:</b> 82 people <br><br><h4>  2.

Also, check out this service for Japanese hieroglyphs recognition - <a href="http://appsv.ocrgrid.org/nhocr/">http://appsv.ocrgrid.org/nhocr/</a> . <br><br>  In this place most of the participants started having problems until the publication of the hint. <br><br>  We have a link to our ‚Äúcase‚Äù and dossier number for the Japanese (126), which we must find.

If the title in the upper left corner is enlarged, rotated and pushed into the translation service, the link to which is in the tooltip, and then to Google Translate, then we will recognize the name: <b>Haru Sakata</b> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/667/c17/bff/667c17bff712ec2029e53b92e929ade4.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/169/0b8/9e1/1690b89e151d96ed7c5b0495061d2bde.png" alt="image"><br><br>  By the way, this is what happens if you do not enlarge the image: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ec1/25f/4ca/ec125f4ca9d9dd9ab7cbda2d035d763f.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The task is not over yet - players will find out the date of birth and place of work of the Japanese. <br><br>  There are as many as four <b>Haru Sakata</b> on twitter.com, of which we made three for the contest.  Google Images helps to separate the "real" from the unreal.  The image search service will help to understand that this person is not at all Haru Sakata, but, say, a famous Japanese actor. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3f7/caf/5fe/3f7caf5fed95253ba6a0f0a960f50959.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Solved:</b> 4 people <br>  <b>Points:</b> 20 <br><br><h5>  2.3.

This photo can be viewed in the original: zip: //46a2934643bf3f80c530aee55195594d.docx/word/media/image2.emf <br><br>  Now the picture becomes clearer: the character must be somehow connected with Paris, it‚Äôs not by chance that this iron thing appeared on it :) <br><br>  As a result, as many as five people could not distinguish this counsel from its counterparts with the exact same photo, but not related to Paris. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e41/bdf/af3/e41bdfaf30afdc10d7cbb4367ff5fcd7.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Decided:</b> 9 people <br>  <b>Points:</b> 20 <br><br><h5>  2.4.

Why do you think there is an e-mail? <br><br>  The only thing that we have not provided for in the mechanism for checking the correctness of the answers is that the participants (or the organizers) confuse the first and last names, and no single answer will be considered correct. <br><br>  And the task was easy enough: we find the ftp.wwidol.com domain (brute force or AXFR requests that were allowed for the wwidol.com domain), which has anonymous FTP access.

If you send a letter to the johnsmith@athc.biz box, we will receive two hints in the reply. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e5a/588/cb8/e5a588cb8429b5cf82e9705ed3b7cc8a.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The first - some kind of anti-virus checks all the links from the letter, apparently for viruses, although, judging by the news (http://habrahabr.ru/post/180163/), it may be for other purposes;) <br><br>  The second is that the NetGear N600 router, which has very interesting vulnerabilities, looks at the Internet: <a href="http://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/32883/">www.exploit-db.com/exploits/32883</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9d6/f2c/553/9d6f2c553625033105638f46b189a032.png" alt="image"><br><br>  That's what will happen if you throw the "antivirus" link to your resource: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/694/eaa/80a/694eaa80a673959fcc23bb3b742f864a.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The IP address 162.243.77.131 really has a router that has the vulnerabilities mentioned above, which allow, say, to get the admin password, despite the HTTP 401 response: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/20d/f4d/abe/20df4dabeb761a2b793d41b2a19e6a3e.png" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/903/4e3/85c/9034e385c628dacd16dd43d0eb84ee4f.png" alt="image"><br><br>  In this ‚Äúmodel‚Äù of the router, there is already more functionality: and the attachment of the logo to the footer of pages, as some mobile operators are doing now, and the SMB Manager, which with the help of the Java Applet allows you to ‚Äúplay around‚Äù on computers on the internal network, you would only know the IP address . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f6c/afd/2f2/f6cafd2f2df013dd7bb0187fe9cf3436.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4f6/a73/489/4f6a734897963f65b0268ff4a5c6e57b.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Judging by the hint, you can figure out the IP address using the footer change form in the HTML pages and the exploit modification from the hint: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a28/7b5/4de/a287b54de1f5ab4aca6d3f89b5649d8c.png" alt="image"><br><br><pre> <code class="perl hljs">&lt;script&gt;

What a freaking surprise! <br><br>  Well, in order to learn everything about the taxi driver, the participants needed to get into the mail of the lawyer, his brother.  Those who passed the 3rd task knew his birthday.  In the mail you could find the username and password from the mail of the Indian. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/255/059/227/255059227849536e68381cfa5df6ff22.png" alt="image"><br><br>  And in the Indian post it becomes clear that he actively uses "apple devices". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/212/63f/b3e/21263fb3ef28bdbe855ff6eddea6e3b5.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The account from iCloud coincided with the postal one, but in any case, if desired, it could also be reset, having access to the mail.  Having entered iCloud, it was enough for participants to simply track the iPhone, which we sent to Delhi in advance :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/527/0e5/584/5270e5584ef8ab7665948caab0b2af45.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Decided:</b> 2 people <br>  <b>Points:</b> 40 <br><br><h5>  3.3.

But on which host?  If the participant had already made an AXFR request by that time, then he knew about the host src.wwidol.com, if not - now it was time to either add third-level domains, or do this Zone Transfer Request. <br><br>  The password is very fast: this is the string ‚Äúadmin‚Äù, which is enough to get all the information about the admin in the file /about-me.txt <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5e8/a59/09d/5e8a5909d4cb48f79b859551281a997d.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Decided:</b> 3 people <br>  <b>Points:</b> 30 <br><br><h5>  3.4.
