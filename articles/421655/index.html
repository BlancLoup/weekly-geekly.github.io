      Andreev received secondary technical education.  Since the beginning of the 1920s he lives in Leningrad.  In 1919, he developed the world's first knapsack rocket apparatus on a liquid jet engine.  The project was sent to the Council of People's Commissars, and from there to the Committee for Inventions.  The patent application, having received a critical review, was rejected.  In 1925, the inventor submitted a new, revised version of the application.  After a positive expert opinion and further alteration of the text, in 1928 a patent was granted for an invention.  ( <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2590%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B2,_%25D0%2590%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2581%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4%25D1%2580_%25D0%25A4%25D1%2591%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587_(%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C)">Wikipedia</a> ) <br><br><h3>  1919 </h3><br>  In the Leningrad Regional State Archive in the city of Vyborg (LOGAV) there is a typewritten text (LOGAV. F. P-4476, op. 6, d. 3809.) of the project with two registration marks on the first page.  The first of these marks is as follows: <br><br>  "BUSINESS MANAGEMENT <br>  Krestyansk.  and working.  Governments <br>  Republic of Russia 14 / XII 1919 <br>  Enter  No. 19644. " <br><br>  The second mark: <br><br>  "COMMITTEE <br>  for inventions <br>  At Nauchn.-Tekh.Otd. <br>  V.S.N. X. <br>  December 19, 1919 <br>  Vh.  No. 3648. " <br><br>  The document with these notes was, as follows from the application written on 10 February 1921 by the inventor's hand, one of the three copies of the draft text submitted to the CDI together with the application (the other two are stored in the same archive file). <br><br>  So, the draft of the backpack aircraft was ready by mid-December 1919 and managed to visit the two highest state institutions of the country during December. <br><br>  It can be assumed that the events developed as follows. <br><br>  The inventor sent the project to Sovnarkom in an attempt to obtain materials for the implementation of his plan, rather than hoping to patent it.  The attractive prospects for military use of the device (in the section ‚ÄúPurpose‚Äù, Andreev wrote: ‚ÄúYou can do aerial reconnaissance with the help of the device with greater security than on an airplane ... whole military units being equipped with these devices (the cost of which in factory production will be several times more expensive than a rifle) ) at offensive in general and the siege of the fortresses, bypassing all earthly obstacles, they can fly completely freely to the rear of the enemy "), it would seem, they allowed to hope for a favorable attitude of the government  to the invention. <br><br>  However, in the Council of People's Commissars, the project, as can be assumed on the basis of a small difference between the indicated dates of its registration, was not considered, but was immediately redirected to a more appropriate address - to the Scientific and Technical Department of the Supreme Council of the National Economy, or even directly to the CDI.  Moreover, it was done from, apparently, in a big hurry: in the register of the incoming documents of the Council of People's Commissars for 1919, the line of the incoming number 19644 (from whom the document came in, what was sent) was not filled at all, just as the lines of three more the numbers adjacent to it (19640, 19643, 19645). It can be seen that the staff of the Council of People's Commissars was not up to processing mail in December 1919. <br><br>  No other traces of the Andreev project in 1919 on the Council of People's Commissars ‚Äî as, indeed, in the organs of the Supreme Council of the National Economy ‚Äî could be found.  It is unclear how long the project was in the CDI and how soon it returned to the author.  [ <a href="http://epizodsspace.airbase.ru/bibl/iz-istorii/andreev.html">Source</a> ] <br><br><h3>  1921 </h3><br>  In February 1921, Andreev wrote a statement to the CDI with a request for a ‚Äúlegal right‚Äù and deficient materials for the project, and, unfortunately, does not mention in a word in this statement what preceded it. <br><br>  Chronicle of further events in brief is as follows.  On the basis of the devastating review of E.N. Smirnov, one of the two experts who were approached by the KDU (the second review was very restrained, although generally positive, was given by N.R.nin), the application was rejected.  [ <a href="http://epizodsspace.airbase.ru/bibl/iz-istorii/andreev.html">Source</a> ] <br><br><h3>  1925 </h3><br>  In July 1925, the inventor submitted a new, seriously revised version of the application to CDI.  However, as noted above, the processing touched mainly the presentation of the material and did not bring in fundamentally new details to the project;  in fact, it almost completely boiled down to the textual description of assemblies and units, which in 1919-1921.  were presented only in the drawing.  After the positive review of the expert N. G. Baratov and the further alteration of the text, on March 31, 1928, the ‚ÄúPatent of the invention patent‚Äù was signed.  [ <a href="http://epizodsspace.airbase.ru/bibl/iz-istorii/andreev.html">Source</a> ] <br><br><h3>  Patent number 4818 </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/86e/536/9be/86e5369be1df3efc916ced741a0cfd67.png" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b94/bb6/c60/b94bb6c6000d51d4d13a1b4bfc6da5e7.png" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ebc/fd4/fe1/ebcfd4fe1adfec96df6974aa5cf7ceef.png" alt="image"><br><h3>  1928 </h3><br><blockquote>  "Upon receipt of the patent on August 23, 1928, I proceeded to its implementation, since  most of the work on implementation takes place in the apartment where I live, then I ask for help about not applying a forced resettlement to my area of ‚Äã‚Äã10 sq. m.  such contributes to successful work. " <br>  - Andreev </blockquote><br>  TsBRIZ (Central Bureau for the Implementation of Inventions and the Promotion of Invention) - on the basis of a negative opinion from an expert engineer of the Selection Board dated January 9, 1929 - refused the assistance requested by Andreev. <br><br>  The technical content of the project Andreeva for 10 years in fact, has not changed from the original version to the final known.  The latter differs from the first one mainly in the text description of some devices, which, although, as can be seen from the first version of the drawing, were from the very beginning in the author‚Äôs intention, however, in the 1919 text they were either not considered at all or described in less detail than in the text of the patent description published in 1928, such as, for example, a pilot device, pumps, a vessel for liquid gases.  Another difference of the patent description from the original project consists in a broader formulation of the scope of application of the device: not only (in the form of a knapsack) for human flight, but also for moving small loads, for example, a projectile with asphyxiating gas, an explosive. <br><br>  On the results of the desire of Andreev to carry out his project in practice, nothing is known.
