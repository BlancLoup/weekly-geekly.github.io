  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Five common mistakes novice managers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p>  All good!  As always, a little about us: the <a href="https://otus.pw/K3Qh/">‚ÄúDevelopment Manager‚Äù</a> course, despite its novelty for being a not quite clean ‚Äúprogrammer‚Äù course, turned out to be very successful in terms of the number of people who graduated: only four people were eliminated from more than thirty people, and even then learning related reasons.  So having finished one stream, we start now the second one, having slightly updated and added now open lessons, where you can get acquainted with the teacher - <a href="https://otus.pw/3j4q/">Stanislav Mikhalsky</a> , and in general with what is given on it. </p><br><p>  Well, also, as always - a small article-article from a teacher about typical mistakes that he, and probably everyone had to face. </p><br><p>  Go. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2f0/262/065/2f0262065eafd2769c0b3166d97d20e5.png" alt="DevHead_Deep_LAST_11.07_2_Site.png"></p><br><p>  <em>‚ÄúAlways honestly admit your mistakes, it will dull the vigilance of the authorities and allow you to mess things up new.‚Äù</em> Mark Twain <a name="habracut"></a></p><br><h1 id="1-prosche-samomu-vsyo-sdelat-chem-obyasnit">  1. Easier to do everything yourself than to explain </h1><br><p>  This is probably the most common mistake.  For some reason, many people think that it is more difficult to set a task than to solve it yourself.  Especially in the situation of the approaching deadline.  Often, managers are justified that "now is not the time to teach others, you just have to do business."  And in the next project they are again in the same situation. </p><br><p>  <strong>Output:</strong> conscious willful effort not to allow yourself to perform the tasks of the performers.  The key competence of a manager is to achieve results not by himself, but by the whole team.  A leader who cannot do this is not a very good leader. </p><br><h1 id="2-ya-teper-rukovoditel-i-v-detali-vlezat-ne-hochu">  2. I now head and I do not want to get into the details </h1><br><p>  The leaders who came ‚Äúfrom outside‚Äù are inclined to this extreme.  Some do not dive into the business at all.  This is as bad as the previous error.  A good salesperson himself necessarily participates in transactions.  The leader of the evangelists must speak well himself.  The programmer must understand the code. </p><br><p>  <strong>Truth is in the middle: a</strong> good manager needs to know how a business works, in detail.  But not to try to do all the work for your employees - it will not work anyway, sooner or later he will rest on natural limitations, and the team will not develop. </p><br><h1 id="3-ya-hochu-kontrolirovat-vsyo">  3. I want to control everything </h1><br><p>  The situation is similar to the first one, but the emphasis here is different.  The head seems to give the task to the performer.  But at the same time wants to see almost every character code!  The employee is constantly ‚Äúunder the hood‚Äù, and the manager asks him to put himself in a copy of all the tasks, asks for daily work reports, and so on. </p><br><p>  Naturally, the employee does not feel responsible for the result.  The leader delegated to him the execution, but not the responsibility.  Not only that micromanagement great reduces the efficiency of labor and the performer, and the head.  It also completely deprives of motivation. </p><br><h1 id="4-ya-ne-interesuyus-tem-chto-proishodit">  4. I am not interested in what is happening. </h1><br><p>  Reverse situation: the head is fully transferred and the performance and responsibility of the employee.  But not even interested in the progress of the project or the implementation of the task.  In this case, the contractor does not feel that the task is important for the manager, does not have the opportunity to ask for advice, does not receive feedback from the manager and, as a result, makes mistakes or at least does not achieve the maximum result. </p><br><p>  <strong>Exit: you</strong> need the right balance.  Extremes do not work in either direction.  Search for the right balance, individual for each employee. </p><br><h1 id="5-putat-loyalnost-i-predannost">  5. Confused loyalty and loyalty </h1><br><p>  We recall Shakespeare and "King Lear."  Novice executives often confuse loyalty and dedication.  This is a very dangerous mistake.  After all, far from always those who agree with you will be with you in difficult times.  And those who argue with you do not always give pleasant feedback and save you from error, often turning out to be your most loyal companions.  Not to distinguish loyalty from loyalty is a big mistake, since not always the absence of loyalty means loyalty. </p><br><p>  The consequence of this error is to recruit managed employees to the team.  Who will treat you loyally.  And the obstinate, having their own opinion - to avoid.  A special case: to avoid people stronger than yourself, for fear that you will ‚Äúsit down‚Äù.  This is a very big mistake.  The caliber of a manager is determined by the caliber of the people who work for him. </p><br><h1 id="bonus-samaya-bolshaya-oshibka">  BONUS: The biggest mistake </h1><br><p>  Not to admit one's mistakes, to be ashamed of them, to hush up them, not to be willing to discuss them is the biggest mistake.  In fact, there is nothing wrong with them.  They are the best indicator that you are developing.  Is it possible to learn to ride a bike without ever falling?  Is it possible to learn how to fry pancakes without making at least one pancake lumpy? </p><br><p>  On the contrary, if you do not make mistakes, then you have stopped in development.  So please mistakes.  Thank those who point them to you.  Do not be offended, do not argue and do not make excuses.  Draw conclusions and grow above yourself. </p><br><p>  THE END </p><br><p>  We are waiting, as usual, for comments and questions, and we invite you to <a href="https://otus.pw/hyfR/">an open lesson</a> where the first mistakes of a specialist will be considered. </p></div>
