For this, I registered my own Limited Liability Company in Russia and a company abroad, received a couple of patents and, if you look at the project more realistically, it is ready for more than 70% in half a year.  In the team, I have a designer and a ‚Äúpack of advisers‚Äù ... At this stage I decided not to look for an investor, but to begin this at the stage of 95-100%.  I did not find any analogs for him, but I searched for a long time, so the development of the project is worth it.  But that's not the point. <br><br>  Since the discussion of the <a href="http://i-gorod.com/">i-gorod</a> site was constantly going on, I decided to try myself as a participant in this project's <s>cutting</s> ... <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><h4>  How to apply? </h4><br>  This requires registration on the site.  We drive in E-mail, password and security code ... And we are already there.  Where you are physically is not important.

    <h4>  Who can apply? </h4><br>  Yes, even someone.  Legal entity, individual, individual entrepreneur - it does not matter. <br>  After you have to wait for the results of your application.  If it satisfies the foundation, then you can safely roll in Skolkovo. <br>  An individual can then, if he wants, create a Legal Entity, and thus become a member of Skolkovo "essentially." <br><br>  However (!), The <a href="http://www.i-gorod.com/docs/20100928-fz-244/">provision</a> states that only a Legal entity or an Individual entrepreneur may be a participant. <br>  And in <a href="http://www.i-gorod.com/docs/20101220-status-uchastnika/">this position, in</a> general, it can only be a legal entity ... <br><br>  Already interesting ... <br><br>  And, by the way, all scanned copies of documents should be exclusively in PDF ... <br><br>  Well, it's not long ... <br><br><h4>  Can I get funding from the fund? </h4><br>  Sure you may!  To do this, you need to provide only a little: <br><br>  - A brief description of the innovative project (the essence of innovation); <br>  - A brief description of the market (demand for a product or technology, as well as competition); <br>  - A brief description of your company (employees, name, etc.); <br>  - A brief description of the financial plan (how much money you need, how much, when and in what quantity they will fight off); <br>  - Brief description of risks; <br>  - Specify separately how much money you need from the Skolkovo Foundation. <br>  - How are you going to make money on your innovation; <br>  - Than your innovation is better than the competition; <br>  - What is your innovation interesting users; <br>  - Technical description of the product; <br>  - Roadmap of the project; <br>  - Characteristics of the consumer (yes, you still have to be an awesome psychologist with a time machine); <br>  - The size, dynamics and segmentation of the target market; <br>  - Barriers to entry into this market; <br>  - Existing and potential competitors (and here the time machine is useful); <br>  - What conditions are required for the "conquest" of the desired market; <br>  - Financial documents about themselves and existing investors, as well as investment schedules and estimates; <br>  - Sales forecast; <br>  - All kinds of risks. <br><br>  I understand that all this, logically, should already be when searching for an Investor (there is experience in the previous project).  Therefore, we go further. <br><br><h4>  Up to which date can I apply? </h4><br>  Reception of applications is ongoing. <br><br><h4>  Is an application required in English? </h4><br>  As stated on the site, if you want to speed up the consideration of the application, then yes.  However, when filling out an application in Russian - an application in English is required ... When submitting an application in English - it is possible not to apply in Russian. <br>  Alas, such is the " <b>Russian</b> Silicon Valley". <br><br>  This is also not a problem ... <br><br><h4>  Requirements for the applicant to participate </h4><br>  Why did I put this in the end?  Yes, very simple. <br>  So, the requirements: <br><br>  - Applicant is a legal entity <br><br>  And you can file and an individual, but it must be legal.  Where is the logic here - it's hard for me to understand.  Well, okay, I have a jur.  face. <br><br>  - The constituent documents allow the implementation of research, development and commercialization activities in the following areas: energy efficiency and energy saving;  nuclear technology;  space technology;  medical technology;  strategic computer technology and software. <br><br>  No problem!  It was thought out at the beginning, because  I do software. <br><br>  - The applicant undertakes to carry out research activities. <br><br>  I have already ceased to understand what ‚Äúresearch activity‚Äù is, therefore I agree. <br><br>  - The project submitted by the applicant involves the participation in it of a specialist engaged in scientific and (or) teaching activities in a Russian and (or) foreign educational and / or scientific institution, which is confirmed by his written statement. <br><br>  Well, let's ask the mom for a statement, she‚Äôs just a teacher ... Although I don‚Äôt know how to get the rest out. <br><br>  - The project complies with the requirements: Complies with the Directions of activities  involves the development and (or) commercialization of unique and (or) possessing competitive advantages over world analogues products and (or) technologies; <br><br>  Here I hope I will pass.  But I didn‚Äôt specifically indicate the last point ... Here it is: it proposes the participation in the project of a foreign specialist who has considerable authority in the investment and / or research environment.  The participation of the specified person and (or) his intention to participate in the project is confirmed by his written statement. <br><br>  And now the question is: if I find a foreign investor, are you sure that I will not go abroad, and not to Skolkovo?  Wow!  Where can I get a foreign specialist with considerable authority? <br><br>  Simply put, to develop it is necessary to have a tough and reputable specialist in the company.  As a result, your company must pay him a lot of money to work for you ... <br><br>  Well, and how can my company with a potentially ‚Äúcool‚Äù project get into a developed IT community?  Yes, nothing.  The point is not even in the project, but in the fact that Skolkovo, logically, was created for cool companies that, no matter how ridiculous they may sound, are fleeing from Russia. <br><br><h4>  Total </h4><br>  In general, I "spat" on Skolkovo.  It is possible to find an investor and a place with great success not only without Skolkovo, but, according to the established impression, it is even better without Skolkovo. <br>  And about the development of the company in Russia - the topic is as old as the world. <br><br>  All for innovation and development? <br><br>  <b>UDP</b> : as I learned here, weaving in Skolkovo costs from 150 to 250 thousand dollars.  Real estate in the area - from 15 thousand dollars per meter. <br><br>  <b>UDP 2</b> : As it was said by the user <a href="https://megamozg.ru/users/kochetkovweb/" class="user_link">kochetkovweb,</a> Yandex yesterday launched the <a href="">Yandex.Factory</a> project, which has a good chance of becoming a Russian Startup Center.  I will try my luck ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/292532/">https://habr.com/ru/post/292532/</a></p>
