    <h4>  Email Marketing Trends </h4><br>  Let's start by talking about noticeable trends in email marketing.  Here you can highlight several important facts. <br><br><h5>  4.3 billion accounts in 2015 </h5><br>  According <a href="http://pechkin-mail.ru/">to</a> researchers, in 2015, 4.3 billion email accounts will be surpassed.  This means that e-mail not only does not lose its popularity, but will continue to be one of the most sought-after channels of digital communication. <br><br>  It is also obvious that companies will strive to get as wide an audience as possible with the help of newsletters.  Below are a few statistics, using which you can achieve better results when working with email. <br><br><h5>  The length of the subject field is not particularly important. </h5><br>  Mailchimp‚Äôs email service team conducted a survey to find out if the length of the email subject is affecting its effectiveness.  Analysts <a href="http://blog.mailchimp.com/this-just-in-subject-line-length-means-absolutelynothing/">examined</a> 12 billion letters sent in 2012 to see how an increase in the length of the subject field affects the opening rate of the letters and the number of clicks on the links inside it.  The results suggest that the length of the topic does not affect these indicators: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d22/10b/d69/d2210bd695535cfc9a09c0d0f884797d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Representatives of the company Adestra <a href="http://www.adestra.com/true-false-shorter-subject-lines-will-give-better-results/">conducted</a> their study, which confirmed the fact that the discovery rate does not depend on the length of the letter.  As for the clicks and the number of users who clicked on the links after the letter was opened, it turned out that the longer topics of the letters show the best results: <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fcd/8aa/090/fcd8aa090d4dfea108ddd0467e45b368.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br><h5>  Personalization is the key to success </h5><br>  According <a href="http://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33901/The-Ultimate-List-of-2012-Email-Marketing-Stats.aspx">to</a> the same Adestra, a letter with a personalized topic will be opened with a probability of 22.2%. <br><br><h5>  Social buttons in letters increase CTR </h5><br>  According <a href="http://blog.getresponse.com/social-sharing-boosts-email-ctr.html">to</a> GetResponse, emails with social network buttons installed in them showed a CTR 158% higher than mailings that did not include such buttons. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/73e/5a4/836/73e5a483604907f5136c60c098fc5904.png" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Runet statistics </h4><br>  A large number of emails are sent daily through the <a href="http://pechkin-mail.ru/">Pechkin-mail.ru</a> service, which gives us the opportunity to collect interesting statistics on which e-mails of Runet companies show the best results, and what factors influence this. <br><br><h5>  It is most advantageous to send mailings on Monday </h5><br>  There is a widespread belief that the best results in the implementation of email-mailings can be achieved if you send letters on Tuesday (there are also <a href="http://netology.ru/blog/mythbusters-why-not-tuesday">refutations of</a> this thesis). <br><br>  There is evidence that on Monday it is possible to achieve the greatest financial return from the sent letters - our statistics confirm the thesis about the productivity of the first working day (although, hand on heart, other days of the week are slightly worse for mailing): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2ce/d7c/d61/2ced7cd6132e6c404a8eea8789d2b1af.png" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  In the first days after mailing it is opened most often. </h5><br>  Despite the fact that according to some studies, e-mail <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/10349547/Email-the-slowest-form-of-customer-service.html">is named</a> one of the slowest ways to communicate with customers, our data suggests otherwise.  In fact, mailings are very fast - half of all discoveries of letters are made within 6 hours, and in the first day - more than 75%. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b97/d91/feb/b97d91feb5285339cbd2c5a3d7e180bc.png" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  When letters are best read </h5><br>  People read e-mail throughout the entire working day - as seen in the graph, the distribution of the percentage of letter openings is fairly even.  In order to get the largest audience reach, you should send a newsletter at the beginning of the working day - most of the discoveries will happen in the first few hours, so you do not need to wait until night. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cda/d8e/446/cdad8e446667e92adfad91627c2f66b2.png" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  Gmail ahead of Rambler-mail by the popularity of in RuNet </h5><br>  Two years ago we already <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/pechkin/blog/179371/">published</a> similar material on Habr√©.  According to the statistics of that time, users of the RuNet more often sent letters through the Rambler mail.  Since then, Gmail has managed not only to play the backlog, but also significantly outpace the competitor. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/504/dd4/768/504dd4768d6bd85642fc6a6a2aaad494.png" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  How effective is sending IT companies </h5><br>  Many IT companies in recent years have begun to actively use mailings as a means of communication with customers and have achieved some success in this field.  According <a href="http://mailchimp.com/resources/research/email-marketing-benchmarks/">to the</a> Mailchimp service, mailing lists of technology projects, in general, read no worse than letters from companies from other industries. Below is a section of telecommunications companies, social services, software developers and online stores: <br><br><table><tbody><tr><th>  Industry </th><th>  Opening rate </th><th>  Clicks </th><th>  Waivers </th></tr><tr><td>  Social services </td><td>  22.54% </td><td>  3.81% </td><td>  0.44% </td></tr><tr><td>  Software and mobile application developers </td><td>  23.27% </td><td>  2.80% </td><td>  1.17% </td></tr><tr><td>  Telecommunications </td><td>  20.63% </td><td>  2.25% </td><td>  1.26% </td></tr><tr><td>  E-commerce </td><td>  17.14% </td><td>  2.69% </td><td>  0.36% </td></tr></tbody></table><br>  For comparison, real estate organizations have a bounce rate of 22.20%, a click rate of 2.29% and a bounce rate of 0.87%. <br><br>  That's all, thank you for your attention.  In our next publications we will talk about how to typeset and arrange letters so that they do not fall into the spam folder, services and tools for creating HTML versions of letters, technologies for recording clicks, discoveries and spam, and other interesting topics. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/252641/">https://habr.com/ru/post/252641/</a></p>
