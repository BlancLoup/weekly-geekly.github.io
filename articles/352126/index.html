  <section class="page js-page"><h1>CodeFest 2018: We Hire Talents</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fm/7x/av/fm7xavjgrtdxdn6k4gxhiwzi-ls.jpeg"></p><br><p>  From March 31 to April 1 at the CodeFest 2018 conference in Novosibirsk, you can become members of the Cloud Mail.Ru, Tarantool or Mail.Ru Cloud Solutions (MCS) development team.  The lucky ones at the conference will receive a job offer in our head office with a move to Moscow!  You can learn all the details and sign up for an interview on the site <a href="http://codefest.mail.ru/">codefest.mail.ru</a> <a name="habracut"></a></p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8a/l_/iz/8al_izh9qhm7ifyjtdv_zzudtqw.jpeg"></p><br><p>  By the way, if you recommend your friend for one of the vacancies and we take it, you will receive a bonus of 100 thousand rubles. </p><br><p>  Read more about the Mail.Ru Cloud Solutions project and what we value in people, says Ilya Letunov, head of MCS, and Ilya Zaretsky, technical director of cloud solutions at Mail.Ru Group. </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BijEjOHmopM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><p>  The MCS project is a new line of business for the Mail.Ru Group, which combines selected cloud-based B2B services Infra, Hotbox and Icebox.  The teams that developed them are also brought together into a single team, and more resources are now allocated for the development of MCS than for the three ‚Äúold‚Äù services combined. </p><br><p>  At this stage, we made basic IaaS services: a private virtual network, object storage and backup storage, a balancer, NAS, NFS and CIS network storage systems, block storage and configuration management services ... In the future we plan to launch a number of PaaS services, and as a result we hope to get concrete solutions for tasks of any complexity, for any IT infrastructure.  Within three years, Mail.Ru Group plans to occupy 15% of the domestic market for IaaS solutions. </p><br><p>  If you need to make a React / Redux-solution, build an ERP, deploy 1C, make a backend or a mobile application, you can configure any environment from our ready-made IaaS and PaaS services, quickly scale it, convert it into a testing and development environment.  This is our main business message and strategy. </p><br><p>  Our product is designed for admins, DevOps and developers.  He is very close to us, because we make the product for ourselves as well, we use it when creating other solutions.  In addition, we are trying to ensure that our service has a ‚Äúhuman face‚Äù: we provide high-quality technical support 24/7 and focus on the needs of customers, are attentive to the wishes and requests of each of them. </p><br><p>  The product consists of three modules. </p><br><p>  The first is OpenStack, this is an open-source engine, on the basis of which we deploy IaaS. </p><br><p>  The second is the object storage developed by us, which allows you to load data and work with it within any infrastructure. </p><br><p>  And the third is a front-end solution, admin panel, in which we put all our UI / UX product development experience. </p><br><h2 id="kak-ustroeny-produkty-mcs">  How are MCS products arranged? </h2><br><p>  MCS cloud storage is based on the same technologies that Mail.Ru Cloud is built on.  The main language is Perl, we have a lot of experience developing on it, so you can deepen your knowledge and better understand the subtleties of this language. </p><br><p>  Virtual machines in the MCS project are built on OpenStack technology, and Python is actively used in this area.  The frontend is built on a framework that is widely used in all other Mail.Ru Group products.  However, we are finalizing it with the use of React, so candidates should be able to work with this technology. </p><br><p>  It is very important for us that those who come to the team understand what kind of product they are doing, and not just solve the tasks set by the product manager, but also help make business decisions.  You can determine the development of the product.  This is our drive, and this is what we expect from our future colleagues.  After all, the market is now very unpredictable, and the business is actively adapting to customer needs.  We do not make plans for the year ahead.  Every two or three months, we can completely rebuild to the current market requirements.  And this requires flexibility of thinking and the ability to independently make decisions at the developer level. </p><br><p>  Some of the scenarios that we implement, the developer may know many times better than the product manager setting the tasks.  The ability to communicate and interact is very important qualities that we seek in people. </p><br><p>  In terms of graphics and remote work, our team is very open and free.  Independence is also a very important quality.  We are focused on the result, on the commitments that we take on the scheduling.  Then a person can independently solve all issues, contact with any units. </p><br><p>  At the conference, we will hold interviews for two or three hours and are ready to offer work right on the spot.  In the chillout, on the plasmas there will be links to the landing page with a recording of the interviews with Mail.Ru specialists.  Anyone can book a time and chat.  We quickly make business-critical decisions and project this value into employee search. </p><br><p>  In addition, we solve issues with moving to Moscow, pay for tickets for the candidate and family members, the first month of renting an apartment, the services of a realtor, hotel accommodation in Moscow during the search for housing.  Detailed conditions for moving to Moscow and recording a conversation on CodeFest on <a href="http://codefest.mail.ru/">codefest.mail.ru</a> .  And do not forget about the bonus of 100 kilorubles for recommending a friend! </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kk/q2/6i/kkq26iadrmhtymbroaonceaicne.gif"></p><br><p>  <strong>Jobs:</strong> </p><br><p>  <a href="https://corp.mail.ru/ru/jobs/vacancy/2603/">Frontend Developer (MCS)</a> <br>  <a href="https://corp.mail.ru/ru/jobs/vacancy/1219/">Frontend Developer (Cloud)</a> <br>  <a href="https://corp.mail.ru/ru/jobs/vacancy/3547/">Perl Developer (MCS)</a> <br>  <a href="https://corp.mail.ru/ru/jobs/vacancy/2641/">C / C ++ developer</a> <br>  <a href="https://corp.mail.ru/ru/jobs/vacancy/3585/">Solution Engineer</a> <br>  <a href="https://corp.mail.ru/ru/jobs/vacancy/2639/">Site Reliability Engineer (Infra)</a> <br>  <a href="https://corp.mail.ru/ru/jobs/vacancy/1739/">Lead Developer, Python / OpenStack</a> </p><br><p>  <strong>Come to our booth, ask any questions and join our team!</strong> </p></div>
