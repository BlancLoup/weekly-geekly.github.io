How to order it?  In this case, you will be helped by 5 questions to which you, having answered, will easily order a mobile application. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  1. The first banal question, "why do you need a mobile application?". <br>  Although the question is simple, but sometimes it can be difficult to answer.  Answers like this: ‚ÄúThis is fashionable‚Äù, ‚ÄúNow everyone is doing it this way‚Äù and ‚ÄúWe want it like this‚Äù are not accepted.  We need to take this issue a little more seriously.  The customer must understand why he is needed, what functions he has to perform, whether their business model is integrated with the mobile application, or they need an additional sales channel, or is it an image move.  After identifying these hallucinations, it will be easier to move on. <br><br><br>  2. The second question, "what is your budget?". <br>  The reaction is ambiguous, but we have to find out.  From this, what kind of prototype will be;  what complexity will be the design;  how much time will coding and testing;  and whether support is needed after the delivery of the project ... We will need time to analyze the project.  And it is clear that the customer breaks the price not only from one company, there may be several such companies, in which the best option is chosen. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      So why bother to figure out the budget?  The answer is simple: time is money.  Thanks to this, we will understand the whole picture. <br><br>  3. The third question, specifics, "what goals do you want to achieve with a mobile application?". <br>  A brain explosion, yes!  Here, in part, we ourselves help our customers: we find out what the customer has to give to its customers;  what metrics should see in the report;  and also to study the course of action of consumers;  whether consumers achieve their goals;  whether sales conversion increases or not.  There are many goals, you need to find out what exactly the customer will be useful. <br><br>  4. The fourth question, "how will the design of the application be determined?". <br>  Here, the customer swings to the fullest.  At this point, a brain explosion occurs at the performers.  They reveal a desire to see several dozen design options, either they have seen a beautiful design already in an existing application, or they already have a ready-made design.  Initially, it is desirable to proceed from the brand of beech, and in this correspondence to make a prototype.  After the start of the primary version, the design can be improved by analyzing A / V testing and taking feedback from consumers on usability. <br><br>  5. The fifth question, ‚Äúhow will the customer see the whole process from the inside?‚Äù. <br>  Ideally, the customer immediately wants to see all the statements in one piece of paper.  In reality, this is a little different. First, we need to work out business processes.  Secondly, to develop an API (Application Programming Interface), in simple terms, this is ready-made code to simplify the life of the programmer.  In the third writing documentation of various forms.  Further processes on the specifics of the project.  When the customer reaches this stage, he will easily understand what is written here. <br><br>  All successful and productive day.
