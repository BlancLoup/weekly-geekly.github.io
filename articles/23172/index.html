  <section class="page js-page"><h1>iPhone and me</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently I bought an iPhone.  What to do with this unfortunate phone is not clear.  But now I have it.  And there is no one else who would have every chance to buy this miracle of technology if I had not bought it.  It would be worth it a miracle sad and lonely in the store.  I couldn‚Äôt allow this to happen, and now after the official adoption ceremony IT Telefonco lives with me.  Perhaps he would be more fortunate if someone else bought it, would do something good, bright, eternal with it, but what can you do - I have a phone (headless owner who rushes to where this miracle Apply technology).  A lot of different things have been said about him.  I will not repeat this.  I just want to share my thoughts on what can be done with him (besides the desire to arrange a crash test against the wall or unsuccessful attempts to figure out how to call him a third day). <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Immediately it should be said that I have very conflicting feelings about the iPhone.  On the one hand, I knew very well before buying what it is and what it is eaten with.  On the other hand, apparently, my degree is growing, either geekiness or just mischief, and I am already beginning to suffer the illness of all those who dislike Apple devices.  Where are the settings?  Where are they sharing all my settings?  How can I customize this phone for me, so that it would be convenient for me and not someone else to use it?  Once again the idea is confirmed - if you do not see something / do not know, this does not mean that it does not exist.  There are enough settings there with your head, another thing is that you cannot change something significantly here.

      So far, I have an opinion about him: the iPhone is more of a man‚Äôs phone, despite the fact that the girls are delighted with it.  They are delighted until they hold it in their hands.  It is big, I would say, as the phone is very big.  It‚Äôs hard enough for me with my little hands.  Of course, I‚Äôm already getting used to it a bit, but nevertheless, I‚Äôm still afraid to accidentally drop it out of my hands.  He is heavy.  It can not be compared with my previous lightly clamshell-Nokia.  What is there in it that makes people buy it, especially for such money? <br><br>  Sadly, for many iPhones this is a ‚Äúsuper-mega-device‚Äù and ‚Äúglamorous gadget‚Äù (a good bluff is more expensive than money, aha).  We will not be like these people, although the elegance of the iPhone is clearly not taken away.  I like that it is well made.  I like that it is well designed.  I like the fact that the usability of the phone (oh yeah, this scary word just means ease of use) is top notch.  Finally, at least someone took care of me as a user and did a really nice and easy to use thing.  The iPhone is great with my macbook.  Everything synchronizes itself using iTunes.  Once again made me glad that I was not too lazy to fill in the Address Book.  I myself transferred all my mailing records and bookmarks of Safari, I set everything up myself, all I had to do was to enjoy life, receive e-mails and ‚Äúgo hunting‚Äù on the Internet as if without separation from my MacBook.  I quickly copied the music that I constantly listen to, and most importantly - the podcasts.  Finally, I can listen to them normally and correctly on the road.  And striking simplicity and ease of all the above.  Once you can choose what, how and with what to synchronize, then you can only connect the computer to the laptop and click one button "Synchronize", and that's it. <br><br>  Apple is positioning the iPhone as a <em>three-in-one device</em> : a phone, an Internet device, and a player.  My priorities in its use are set to the opposite: <br><br>  1) <strong>player</strong> (music is our everything: ‚Äúmusic is my boyfriend, music is my girlfriend, music is my hot, hot sex‚Äù, as in advertising).  Podcasts, podcasts and once again podcasts are always with me! <br><br>  2) <strong>Internet device</strong> : Wi-Fi at home, when there is no Wi-Fi - EDGE.  Soon (knowledgeable people say, within two months), you can wait for 3G iPhones, but unfortunately, such a fast internet connection is not yet relevant.  Here there is Safari, there is Mail, iChat with support for ICQ and Jabber (more precisely, XMPP protocol) and many Web-apps for every taste and color.  In the mornings and in the evenings, when the computer is either still or has already been built and is quietly sleeping, and I have not woken up myself (or have not quite gone to sleep), I read Habr and <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> .  I have a live broadcast of the series there - I'm afraid of something ‚Äúinteresting‚Äù to miss.  (Do not forget, all Apple products are designed for housewives, so where are we without TV shows).  In the last <a href="http://radio-t.com/podcasts/radio-t-80/">Radio T,</a> I, like other listeners, were told what else you can do with the iPhone: for example, read something or write while taking baths.  I do not do it for two reasons: firstly, I usually take no baths, but a shower in the morning, and I don‚Äôt have much time for fees (so the last five minutes, as always, is not enough), and secondly, I‚Äôm very afraid to drop phone into the water (not only this one, but any other). <br><br>  3) And finally - <strong>just a phone</strong> . <br><br>  Actually, a certain interesting and amusing story is connected with the function of the phone.  I warn you in advance, <em>remove the factory film</em> immediately after the purchase, so that such oddities do not arise.  I bought my iPhone on the eve of the weekend, somehow there weren't any calls in the first days, but on Monday the phone started ringing in the morning.  Imagine my horror: I pick up the phone - I don‚Äôt hear anything, I bring the volume to the maximum - it‚Äôs still very quiet, rather you guess what the interlocutor is talking about, because it is heard in fragments.  Who is to blame and what to do?  Where to run, and why do I need such a phone, on which it is impossible to talk, because I can not hear anything?  I'm just in a panic.  The fact that I just can't make friends with his keyboard adds fuel to the fire.  The buttons are pressed, but somehow tight and not immediately (if at all you can say so about his touch-screen keyboard).  By the way, another fact that confirms that the iPhone - rather a male phone.  It is assumed that the buttons on the screen must be pressed with fingertips.  What do ladies with long manicure - is unclear.  I had to remember the cheerleader times and cut everything under the root to work normally with the device.  (Here are some of the sacrifices that yablofanatiki, yeah).  So, the solution to all the problems turned out to be simple and elegant as the iPhone itself - it was only necessary to remove the protective film.  It turned out to be very dense, making it difficult to press the Home key, which I had managed to dislike because of this, made the interlocutor's speech much quieter than it actually is (of course, how can a poor speaker with a plastic gag try to broadcast?).  Thanks to the <a href="http://www.iphones.ru/forum/">iphones.ru</a> forum, where such uninitiated in all apple-phone wisdom have already been answered this question more than once or twice. <br><br>  In conclusion, I want to say that despite all my conflicting feelings for this phone, I like it more than not (especially without a protective film).  I am not a particularly picky user, and he satisfies my needs with a head.  For me it is very important that in fact three different devices are combined into one, and it is always with me.  The question arises: why did none of the manufacturers have thought of making such a device before?  After talking with the iPhone, you begin to expect that all devices will be like that.  I am just in awe of this new way of interacting with technology - tyts-tyts across the screen!  I'm typing already cheerfully and quickly, I easily change the layouts and place punctuation marks.  Of course, there are not enough ready-made emoticons, but nothing (maybe, even though I‚Äôll disaccustom them with a word).  The device is new, the device is revolutionary, not suitable for everyone, but it can not leave you indifferent (oh, how the windows in Safari fly by pushing a finger!).  This is my subjective opinion.  Perhaps I will still write on this topic, share my thoughts on this subject, for now.  Thank you very much for your attention. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/23172/">https://habr.com/ru/post/23172/</a></p>
