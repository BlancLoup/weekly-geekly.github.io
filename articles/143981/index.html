      It is worth mentioning here that my PC (possessing 640 KB of RAM, a drive for 5.25 "720KB diskettes and a TV instead of a monitor)" did not pull "Turbo Pascal 6.0, which included the Turbo Vision library, and the text CGA mode emulation on The ‚Äúsearch‚Äù was terrible - the characters could be, if memory serves, white / blue / pink on a black background, or black on a blue / pink / white background. <br><br>  In short, I wrote my Turbo Vision graphical analogue under CGA graphics (320x240, 4 colors) on Turbo Pascal 5.5 with pieces of code on Turbo Assembler 2.5 (the trimmed set of this farm just fit on a 720Kb floppy disk). <br><br>  Nuances of CGA-implementation: <br><ul><li>  Graphics libraries are not used. </li><li>  All drawing is done through an intermediate buffer, in which each pixel corresponds to 1 byte (to eliminate flicker and increase drawing speed). </li><li>  Partially overlapping elements are drawn using a mask array (i.e., only unmasked parts of the image are displayed on the buffer). <br>  To save memory, each element of the mask corresponded to a square of 4x4 screen pixels, respectively, the position and size of elements were multiples of 4th. </li><li>  Homemade proportional raster font (standard in resolution 320x240 looked gigantic). </li><li>  Mouse emulation through the cursor keys of the digital block (there were no mice on the ‚ÄúSearch‚Äù)). </li></ul><br>  At that time, my program could not boast of any usefulness, it was rather a ‚Äútechno-demo‚Äù, which I boasted to my fellow students (the windows are being dragged, the buttons are pressed, the watch goes)) <br>  She looked exactly as in the first picture. <br><br>  In the fall of 1996, my father bought (at the cost of great efforts: saving and borrowing dollars, thanks to him) a full-fledged computer (AMD 5x86-133, 4Mb RAM, S3 Trio64 1Mb video, 850Mb HDD, 14 "ARX monitor) to me. <br>  Now you can use Borland Pascal 7.0, a mouse and 256-color SVGA modes. <br><br>  Next implementation: <br><ul><li>  used 256-color VESA-modes, for which UniVBE was installed - a VESA-video BIOS emulator (rare video cards had corresponding built-in support at that time); </li><li>  drawing large elements that do not fit entirely into the buffer, was conducted in horizontal stripes; </li><li>  drew a full-color mouse cursor, which flickered only if superimposed on the region being updated (i.e., flickered much less than in most graphic programs); </li><li>  got support for rendering 256-color images of BMP format; </li><li>  included some ‚Äúported‚Äù / ‚Äúdoped‚Äù to support graphics Turbo Vision sources. </li></ul><br>  In the subsequent period (until 1999), the above developments were used to write some program files. <br><br>  The unfinished educational game for the computer science classroom at school: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bc5/d53/929/bc5d539295d9aa6c325f0d0c2bfd3097.gif"><br><br>  Course work - a game about factories / raw materials / products and other "economic modeling": <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/370/8c5/9c2/3708c59c2477bf7ff4f1b293a10d56cd.png"><br><br>  The simplest under-editor of raster proportional fonts was implemented (before that there was only one small proportional font from the CGA version, you had to use a converted font with a fixed width of characters as a large font): <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/471/740/fbc/471740fbc65d07b7844a44531bfb4f31.gif"><br><br>  Laboratory work on statistical modeling: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/de7/a0a/636/de7a0a63689661172ce88147175ac70e.gif"><br><br>  Laba on logic programming: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ee9/29d/021/ee929d021ce43e5a47f98ddab9bab41a.png"><br><br>  Part of the lab on computer graphics: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/17c/3d3/4e9/17c3d34e91e5dc2e8fdfe4643a602983.png"><br><br>  As a result, by 1999 the following has accumulated: <br><ul><li>  the raster regions were implemented to cut off the invisible areas when drawing, as a result of which restrictions on the size / position of elements were eliminated (I also wanted to make visible elements of arbitrary shape based on the regions, but this was not done); </li><li>  implementation of the Floyd-Stenberg algorithm for adapting the loaded images to the fixed palette used (the 8-bit color had the format RRRGGGBB, i.e., 3 bits were allocated to the intensity of the red and green components, 2 bits were allocated to the blue); </li><li>  some standard controls were ‚Äúported‚Äù (list, drop-down list, file selection dialog boxes, etc.); </li><li>  ability to display / edit labels (implementation of TGrid) </li><li>  due to the increase in available memory and the ‚Äúvictorious march‚Äù of Windows 9x, interest in DOS programs was gradually lost. </li></ul><br><hr><br>  In preparation for the article, I wanted to see how my DOS graphic WVision would look in FullHD resolution, but, unfortunately, I did not find the VESA code for the 1920x1080x8 mode.  Only 1280x1024 was able to be set, took a screenshot (that's just habrastorage stung him to 800x640, while increasing the file size by almost 6 times)): <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b7c/45c/143/b7c45c1430d5baea4a0b0682e4345625.png"><br><br>  Sources and working exe-files are available in the <a href="http://files.mail.ru/GPYN02">WORKS.7z</a> archive <br>  (only the source code of the CGA implementation was lost somewhere on the five-inch floppy disks, only the executable file windy0.exe remained). <br>  Minimum requirements to run: 386-compatible processor, 640KB of RAM, 512KB of video memory, VESA support from the video BIOS (windy0.exe will go to 8086 with CGA graphics). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/143981/">https://habr.com/ru/post/143981/</a></p>
