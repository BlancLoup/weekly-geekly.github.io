  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Erotica and porn at level 2.0</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  More and more erotic and porn sites appear on the Internet that refer to the Web 2.0 generation.  One of the most profitable e-commerce industries is reaching the next level. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I must say that the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãsuch services is quite sensible.  Sex is an interest that unites the absolute majority of people.  Moreover, many people can say that sex and erotica occupy the main place in their life.  This is more important than music, literature, career and other nonsense, on which social networks are often based.  Professionals of porno-commercials will say without a doubt: it is sex that drives people, makes them look for acquaintances and join social networks.  For women, it is even more important than for men. <br><br>  A few months ago, the <a href="http://www.utherverse.com/">Utherverse</a> site was <a href="http://www.utherverse.com/">launched</a> on the Internet - the world's first social network based on sex.  This is a kind of erotic version of MySpace.  Here, users can upload their own erotic pictures, talk about their fantasies and get to know each other.  The basic functionality of Utherverse is no different from the usual social network: each registered user can blog, add friends, update their profile, comment on postings, profiles and photos of other participants, and also share private letters with them.  Everything is free. <br><br>  The creators of Utherverse seriously expect to repeat the success of MySpace.  They <a href="http://today.reuters.com/investing/financeArticle.aspx%3Ftype%3DgovernmentFilingsNews%26amp%3BstoryID%3D2006-07-26T235456Z_01_N26325878_RTRIDST_0_MEDIA-MYSPACE-UTHERVERSE-PICTURE.XML">said</a> that by the end of 2006 they expect to attract at least a million participants.  Obviously, in their plans to entice part of the MySpace audience to themselves, especially since the import of profiles from MySpace is carried out on the site automatically.

      The Utherverse social network was created as an extension of the multi-user erotic 3D universe of <a href="http://www.redlightcenter.com/">Red Light Social Center</a> - a virtual world that exists exclusively for dating, flirting and sex.  In this world, streets, night clubs, virtual bars, cinemas, hotels and other objects are designed in such a way that facilitates the establishment of intimate connections between the participants.  Each character can carefully choose their three-dimensional avatar.  In the basic version, the game is free (though, only those who paid for membership in the VIP club at a cost of $ 20 per month can engage in sex and voice chat). <br><br>  Free membership in the Red Light Social Center includes a dressed avatar, photos and videos with soft eroticism, limited access to the viewing rooms.  Paid membership abruptly: nude avatars, porn galleries, full access to all viewing rooms and all the videos in the cinema. <br><br>  Red Light Social Center - the world's first development of this kind.  Since the opening of the virtual world on May 6, 2006, more than 30 thousand people have already visited it. <br><br>  The social porn network Utherverse develops this idea.  Only here can participants communicate not in a fictional 3D universe, but in a familiar social network space, publish their own photos and make real contacts.  Very convenient, and you don‚Äôt have to pay for sex - social network services are free. <br><br>  The developers of Utherverse and Red Light Social Center specifically emphasize that they created erotic services specifically for women.  This is a general rule for creating a successful erotic service or an erotic multiplayer game on the Internet: women should like it.  If the weaker sex approves the game, then the men themselves will catch up. <br><br>  The creators of the pornographic clone YouTube are trying to please both women and men.  The site <a href="http://pornotube.com/">PornoTube</a> presents erotic and pornographic content of any type: soft and hard.  It supports tags, themed RSS feeds, social bookmarks, comments - in general, all the features of Web 2.0 are on the highest level.  In addition to videos, you can upload sound recordings and photos.  PornoTube is a real-life community that is united around free porn content. <br><br>  Thus, we can state the fact: the porn industry copies one by one all the most successful Internet development of the Web 2.0 era.  There are already multiplayer games, social networks, and video sharing services.  Recently, we talked about <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/article/429/">dating sites 2.0</a> , which, for example, allow you to choose a partner for sexual pleasures, indicating the geographical coordinates of the place of dating.  This is Web 2.0 in all its manifestations.  What is missing?  Is that content with a vote (a la Digg) and integration on mobile devices.  And that, probably, will appear soon. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4227/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4227/</a></p>
