      Angular 2 has changed a lot since the first version.  In this report, Alexander will talk about the general architecture of the new framework, dependency injection, the interaction of components, routing, the compiler, as well as approaches to deploying applications. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/100/3ca/26d/1003ca26d12b447fba9c20196fca5101.png" align="left">  <b>Andrei Gedich, C ++ Developer</b> <br>  <b>Machine learning, parallel and distributed computing in drug discovery</b> <br><br>  When they talk about machine learning, they usually consider it in the context of creating spam filters, recommender systems, text recognition, faces and voices.  In this report, machine learning will be considered in relation to pharmaceuticals, namely drug discovery. <br><br>  The report is divided into 3 parts.  In the first part, Andrei will consider the implementation and the main stages of the pipeline, which is used in drug discovery, using a real example.  In the second part of the report, with reference to C ++, the possibilities that can be used to organize parallel computing will be considered.  In the third part, Andrei will tell how you can use distributed computing to scale an existing solution when it is undesirable or impossible to change the existing code base. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b7e/dac/3d5/b7edac3d578c457a9334bd62db44182c.png" align="left">  <b>Artyom Kravchenko, tester</b> <br>  <b>ISTQB certification for engineer QA</b> <br><br>  Every year more and more specialists with different levels of training come to testing.  And the longer we are engaged in testing, the more we want to structure / systematize our knowledge according to a single standard.  Common language helps to develop international ISTQB certification.  In his report, Artyom will tell you what she is and what benefits she gives, as well as the rules for passing the exam and how to prepare for it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e93/fe8/875/e93fe88754a044c0bde0d3909602f4fc.png" align="left">  <b>Nikolay Seliverstov, JS Developer</b> <br>  <b>HBase and Phoenix as the basis of an ETL application on Node.js</b> <br><br>  In the report, Nikolay will consider the architecture of the distributed Apache HBase NoSQL database and the Apache Phoenix interface to it.  In addition, Nikolai will share his experience of using these tools in a real project, talk about stuffed cones and give practical recommendations. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dd3/808/d14/dd3808d146e747019fbaf838bf586898.png" align="left">  <b>Victor Dimbrovsky, timblide / web developer</b> <br>  <b>Zero downtime - how to release a product to millions of users</b> <br><br>  When participating in the development of a high-load system, developers face many interesting problems that are irrelevant for small projects.  For example, having a large number of active users, not everyone can afford to suspend the system while a new version is being released, which makes the life of developers much more exciting even in relatively simple projects.  What if the system consists of a large set of web applications, services that constantly interact with each other, has a public API, etc.? <br><br>  In the report, Victor will show how to update the application seamlessly for users, identify the main factors that may prevent the release without stopping the application, and also give practical advice on implementation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/875/41e/8a9/87541e8a976c4de199a2cd4c7bbc4573.png" align="left">  <b>Andrei Kholyavkin, Head of the Arcadia Taganrog Office</b> <br>  <b>The Basics of Agile Project Management or Farewell, Project Manager!</b> <br><br>  The principles of Agile and practical methods of their application are widely known today.  In the report, Andrei will consider the aspects of theory and practice proposed by the ICAgile consortium for project managers for certification by Agile Project Management. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/807/b43/0ca/807b430cac5747f7bafd5eee59d45c05.png" align="left">  <b>Mikhail Seliverstov, team leader / web developer</b> <br>  <b>Building a process and applying Best Practices from scratch on an existing product is a living experience.</b> <br><br>  Imagine a situation: the customer comes to you, he already has a product, and you need to organize the process and create the appropriate infrastructure so as to make the work on the product as convenient and efficient as possible. <br><br>  What steps were taken and why, what problems met and how they were solved by the project team in the situation described above, what all this led to at the moment - this will be covered in the report. <br><br><hr><br>  To participate you must register on <a href="http://azov.developersmeetup.ru/adm2016">the conference website</a> .  Participation in the conference is free, the most active participants will receive prizes. <br><br>  Venue: st.
