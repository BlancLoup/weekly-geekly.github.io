I remembered crying on Sunday evening, because I didn‚Äôt want Monday to come.  She remembered getting up at 5:30, so that by 8 she would come to work in Moscow.  As she came home, and the strength after the subway and the train remained only to sit on the sofa, staring at the wall, and observe the complete lack of thoughts in my head.  To wait for the time to go to sleep, to finally fall asleep, and for a new day to come - as empty as the one I had just lived through. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  This was my first ‚Äúadult‚Äù work, and I was horrified to find that weeks, one by one, began to simply fall out of my life, and I was no longer in this life.  I could not remember what I was doing on Monday, what was on Wednesday last week: all the days were absolutely the same.  When I mentally ‚Äúlived‚Äù such a life and looked back, I simply became frightened.  Years spent on working in a corporation in positions where any monkey would do its job no worse than me.  So did I want to live my only life? .. <br><br>  No, after realizing all this, I did not rush headlong to drastically change everything around me.  I was afraid, I did not want to be left without work and again depend on someone, and changing from one office to another would hardly have solved my problem.  The whole year passed like this - with a virtual loop around his neck, with a crush in the morning electric trains and with the nascent thought that something needs to be changed.  I even went to preparatory courses at the British Higher School of Design and was going to get a second education there, but very soon I realized that this was not an option for me: to pay that kind of money for tuition, you need to go to work, you need to hold on to work that eats all the power and does not normally study.  A vicious circle, and I did not pass the entrance exams. <br><br>  And then my friend quite unexpectedly went to work in the field of Internet technology, and after a while offered to resurrect my handmade site, which I abandoned when I went to my first ‚Äúadult‚Äù job.  And after a while we decided to try to fulfill my old dream: to open an online store of personal belongings for needlework.  Anyway, all the money I spent on all sorts of things for handmade, books and other rubbish - why not buy the same in large quantities and not sell from us, and see what happens. <br>  All the costs of creating websites were paid from the office salary, the purchase of goods, too.  The store was opened 2 months ago, and already a little surpassed my expectations in the number of orders :)

      I do not know how this will end, what the result will be.  I know one thing: for the first time in my life, I get real pleasure from what I do every day - and this is the most important thing.  For the first time in my life, I feel interested, I feel a personal responsibility and feel a desire not to stand still, to develop and come up with something new.  I feel the excitement. <br><br>  Now my motto is: "You can do anything you want," and I do not get tired of repeating this to all doubters. <br>  True. <br>  You only need to understand in which direction to move, you only need to start - and you quite unexpectedly find that you have become a completely different person. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/24416/">https://habr.com/ru/post/24416/</a></p>
