It will be interesting both to those who are looking for work, and to those who are looking for those who are looking for work ... confused ... well, read! <br><br>  ‚ÄúThere are many things that are similar in all vacancies and for all candidates, ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  ... for example, if at 8 pm hang up a junior tester's job, then by 8 am you will receive 30 responses and another 70 during the day, and if this is the June exam, then there will be hundreds of responses.  (I was so, I'm not lying!) And the vacancy Frontend-developer responses can wait for weeks at any time of the year.  It will be necessary to try, in a hundredth circle, to look at summaries on hh and the like, to spam social networks, call, humiliate, persuade, threaten, promise much ‚Äî a horse and two monitors. <br>  Of course, those who are eager to work in IT are also hard.  They want a certain salary color, the availability of parking and cookies, crave interesting projects and work from home, if required.  I want very much that out of the hundreds of resumes that flashed before the recruiter‚Äôs eyes, he chose yours.  So that after five steps of interviews, you have already been sent an offer or have your elbows bite off forever. <br>  As a recruiter and job seeker to find each other, do not kill each other at the interview stage, get married and live happily ever after, I will teach you now!

    <h4>  The theater begins with a hanger, and a search with a job description and resume writing. </h4><br>  <b>Recruiter</b> <br>  Stable company, market leader and all that - do you know?  Think someone is reading this?  Calm down, you already slip away from your eyes, like a banner in the upper right corner.  Do not lep in the description of what is written on the main page of the company's website.  It is better to write that you have a cool development team that is looking for a programmer.  Give a link to the site, who are interested, go over and read that you are also stable, and also the leader, and that‚Äôs all.  Next, be sure to indicate WHAT you need to do and HOW.  For example, write that you have a corporate site that was once written by someone, you are looking for a php programmer to support this site as best he could, add new modules from time to time, ensure the interaction of this site with CRM .  How?  Well, of course, I have to say about agile practices and mitaps every week.  A person should read and understand at once about what he will need to do and whether it is worth finding out the details.  Someone hates support for endurance, but don't feed someone with bread.  Mention, by the way, about the team.  What is in the team, it turns out, is one and a half programs and one tester, and not one programmer who repairs the Internet at the same time, if that happens. <br><br>  She came up with a cool description - well done, just see that it was not too girlish and mimic.  Give it to fellow progred colleagues.  If they hate you for bringing them to this terrible office, of course, nothing will come of it.  Otherwise, they will gladly help and give comments. <br><br>  By the way, do not lep in the job that is not needed.  English.  Seriously?  Do you have American management?  Chinese partners?  Customers from Europe?  Then, it's OK.  No - delete this item, do not confuse people. <br><br>  <b>Candidate</b> <br>  Dear friend!  First, please read the description carefully.  Whatever Krivorukov was not the recruiter who wrote him, he reflected the essence.  If you really need (and it‚Äôs written about it, here it is! Right here and even in bold type) so that the content manager distinguishes between h2 and h3 headers and works with at least a year and Wordpress, then you don‚Äôt have to respond to your awesome journalist‚Äôs resume or copywriter.  Well, Kamon!  Surely there are companies that really need such a fashionable, youth, capable and eager to learn the craft of a poster.  Look for it.  Do not burn napalm all jobs in a row.  Even if a recruiter invites you for an interview, everything will open during the conversation, and you will only lose time.  In general, of course, on the topic of resume, you can talk for hours.  But the main thing - you do not know half of the ‚Äúskills‚Äù and did not do half of the ‚Äúduties‚Äù - you risk losing an hour and a half of life plus the road. <br><br>  <i>By the way, the story of life.</i>  <i>I, all so experienced, smart and beautiful, responded to the vacancy, because the company is cool and I really wanted to go there.</i>  <i>The vacancy is written in black and white, they say, knowledge of the PR market and advertising, the experience of public speaking.</i>  <i>And I knocked.</i>  <i>And they called me, well, still.</i>  <i>(The summary is written in black and white about the experience in IT and a little in oil and gas, plus the absence of any hints of publicity).</i>  <i>And we sat like that, two eychars, looked at each other like two fools.</i>  <i>And I did not understand why they called me, but they did not understand what I came for.</i>  <i>Short description of an hour and a half conversation:</i> <i><br></i> <pre> - Experience of public speaking where have you been?
 - Nowhere.
 - How do you know the advertising market?
 - I do not know. 
 - Well, why did you come, we have written a vacancy ...
 - Oh, and what did you call me, read the same summary.
 A curtain. </pre><br><br><h4>  Give birth - half the battle (popular wisdom) </h4><br>  <b>Recruiter</b> <br>  Remember - you never have to wait for the weather by the sea, when the cancer on the mountain whistles, when the water flows under a rolling stone and when a suitable candidate responds by himself. <br>  Look with your hands! <br><br>  Sometimes in my house you can hear the blows of something solid about something solid.  This is my husband beating his head against the wall, because he received another letter from the same Bla-bla-software with a job offer in a stable company.  How is this going?  Every three months in Bla-bla-software one recruiter is replaced by another and figarit the same newsletter on the same base.  And no matter how much my husband wrote or said in words that he was not interested and in general, he absolutely forbade Blah-bla-software to offer anything to him, only the ‚Äúspam‚Äù tag helped. <br><br>  You came all young and promising to a new big company and you think that you are the only one so smart, didn‚Äôt anyone send anything to you?  So, mailings were invented long before you, your predecessors actively used them.  I will not give advice on exactly how to do it.  Even if you are desperate. <br><br>  By the way, 50% of specialists suitable for you are online: they have profiles on Vkontakte, Facebook, Linkedin, Githab ... <br>  But only 3-5% of them were hung up on work sites.  (I didn‚Äôt open it, Sergey Dmitrichenko did it for me, the founder of one of the recruiting companies, he did research and counted). <br><br>  Therefore, when (or if) you were lucky, you found these pitiful% resumes on hh or got a profile on Facebook, do not spoil the raspberries with standard letters, they say, hello, your resume seemed very interesting to us or Please add me to your contact list.  In a letter or message write a shortened or supplemented version of your job description.  There is already everything that is important, what to do, and with what resources.  Once again, do not give information that can be read on the company's website without snot.  In the letter, by the way, remember about the teaser.  If we start with: ‚ÄúHello, we really need a tester, otherwise they will dismiss me!‚Äù, The probability that a person, even out of curiosity, finishes reading to the end.  And once read, then perhaps even give feedback.  Write your personal letters.  Invest time and emotions.  Check out the profile. <br>  I swear they read and respond.  Some interesting, some say, they say, thank you, do not, but I have a friend, here are his contacts. <br><br>  <b>Candidate</b> <br>  Above, I said that your copywriting experience is not interesting to anyone in the position of a content manager.  Do you really want to?  Can you  Tell me about it!  Another true story.  <i>I am looking for a web developer, such a half-junior welterweight, full stack.</i>  <i>A young man of nineteen is responding, only a layout for the money is in the resume.</i>  <i>And he writes a letter to me, they say, he became interested in class 7, learned, put some crap in the 8th grade, sold this crap in 8th grade, bought a normal computer for the money, learned how to make up normal.</i>  <i>Take me to yourself, I will learn this your php and postgreSQL for a month.</i>  And my heart faltered.  And he came and turned out to be cool.  Sits now, programs. <br><br><h4>  Just sex or marry </h4><br>  <b>Recruiter</b> <br>  Lured a candidate for a meeting - good girl!  I did everything right.  Now do not spoil everything.  First, do not be late.  Are you from the generation that remembers shaping?  Are you from a generation that still believes that a candidate should sit for 10 minutes, wait and be nervous?  Forget this stupid rule!  Respect someone else's time, do not disgrace and be for an interview at the time that you yourself appointed.  Convince yourself and your leadership that the seven circles of interviews are impossible and ay-ay-ay.  A rare bird will fly to the middle of the Dnieper (s) and sustain it.  People value themselves, value their time and do not like complicated procedures and long coordination.  And the price can be filled in another way. <br><br>  <b>Candidate</b> <br>  Remember, the people who interview you really want to hire you.  Although a bit wrong: they really want to hire someone, for example, you.  Because the project really needs hands, head, comrade and brother.  Help these people understand what kind of person you are.  I swear, I don‚Äôt understand what the question is about ‚Äúwho you‚Äôre seeing as five-fold‚Äù, but the answers to the questions: what do you expect from a new job, where do you want to grow, why do you quit, etc., are very important for us.  We know the company from the inside, we understand that if we have a startup and everyone does a good job for the sake of purpose, as in the Soviet Union, and you were stifled by startups and you want a thoughtful working structure, guidelines, clearly defined in the task manager with clear deadlines then we are not on the way.  We have to reveal at the interview that if you are seduced by a busty secretary, proximity to the metro station and cookies, you will not quit one day when the manager comes running and says, we say, we are sawing this stuff for a month as you please, just to roll out in time.  And then we check - it will work, we will fix, improve and finish.  It does not work, we begin to cut another garbage, too, urgently.  Do you understand?  Let us know if we fit your desires and expectations. <br><br><h4>  Try not to climb into the water, not knowing the ford </h4><br>  <b>Recruiter</b> <br>  If you previously wrote an awesome code, and then decided, they say, burn everything with fire, go to IT-recruiters, then your employer is very lucky.  And if you graduated from the Faculty of Sociology, Psychology or Philosophy, God forgive me - do not get smart!  You don‚Äôt need to hear the answer to the question ‚ÄúWhen is it better to use a SAX parser, and in which DOMs?‚Äù, And in order not to hear, don‚Äôt need to specify it.  Even if the techirr wrote with his firm hand a detailed answer to this question - do not.  The candidate will answer in other words, and you will fail along with the technical manager.  Find out the usual everyday things: is it comfortable for a person to work in openspace, whether he wants to be the hope and support of trainees or wants to code quietly and not communicate with anyone, is he ready to go out in 2 weeks or have to wait for him longer and so on.  Depends on the features of your company and a specific team.  Then tell me about the company and let the technician continue the conversation.  Just tell me how it is, do not forget about the color of the salary, processing, registration and additional payment of sick leave. <br><br>  <b>Candidate</b> <br>  Do not lie!  Got everyone at the interview in some way?  Blowed test?  Everything will be revealed and if they hire you, they will pull it out during the test period. <br><br><h4>  Feedback </h4><br>  <b>Recruiter</b> <br>  Spend an hour of time and deny everyone who needs to refuse.  Do not embarrass yourself!  Do not spoil the impression of yourself.  The market is big and there are few candidates.  In this office, this particular person did not come in handy, but when you are fired and taken to another wondrous place, it is quite possible that he would fit in perfectly, just like you did.  But his Skype already keeps the history of your correspondence, ending with your words: "We will contact you."  Yes, even if you are cool (like me) and you will not be fired anywhere, keep in touch.  The candidate did not fit now, but it may well fit in a couple of years. <br><br>  <b>Candidate</b> <br>  Answer the letters.  And for calls.  "Thank.  Don't. ‚ÄùThis is already a success.  Anything in life happens, you never know who will have to ask for snow in winter.  Be polite, look to the future, give feedback.  Today she writes to you Please add me to your contact list and invites to Kolkhoz Dawn LLC.  And tomorrow she pumped, settled in JetBrains, went to Munich and huntit people from there.  And he remembers how then, 5 years ago, you sent her to FIG. <br><br>  In general, everyone needs to remember that there is a circulation of everything in the world and everything is interconnected.  If you use only one napkin at each meal and print everything on drafts, saving paper, then the person who sells the forest will soon die of hunger.  If you do not care about the candidates, you will not get good employees.  There will be no one to program, there will be nothing to sell, the company will run out of money, you will be fired and you will also die of hunger. <br><br>  If you act like Ksyusha Sobchak when you are young, star right and left, ignore foolish letters, do not answer, if an unfamiliar number is determined, refuse test ones and that's it, cozy companies of one hundred and fifty people where you can come to 11, but you can by 12, but you can work at all from home or from Thailand, you can hardly be hired.  And we have great :) ‚Äú </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/291810/">https://habr.com/ru/post/291810/</a></p>
