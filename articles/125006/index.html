We receive information</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/037/010/d6d/037010d6d3bd6e72222a0c499faf2bf6.gif" alt="image"><br>  With a boot, we are trying to solve problems related to time: untimely responses (to kick the customer), late execution (to kick the developer), late information (to kick the manual).  We need ticks to solve information-related problems. <br>  <i>Information problems are of 2 types:</i> <i><br><br></i> <ul><li>  There is little information </li><li>  Information is of poor quality (fuzzy, unstructured, contradictory, blurred, not at all about, in Swahili, etc.).  In fact, this is a modified first case, because of the large amount of poor-quality information, we choose bits of truth, and as a result we come to the fact that this information is not enough for us. </li></ul><br><br>  Different managers are struggling with the lack of information with different tools, not necessarily ticks.  Someone prefers to work with an iron, others indulge in a soldering iron.  The benefit of the Inquisition and the KGB left the accumulated experience and a wide range of ways of obtaining information. These are lyrics.  Now in the case.

    <a name="habracut"></a>  <b>Who usually have to be treated with ticks?</b> <br><br>  1. Customers.  Favorite, dear clients have to be tortured with ticks, since the description of the requirements for the project with the wording ‚Äúmake me pleasant‚Äù or ‚Äúmake me beautiful‚Äù gives an incomplete picture of the desired result. <br><br>  2. Experts.  I place experts in a special category.  An expert can be your boss, your neighbor in the office opposite, any professional from whom you need information, advice. <br><br>  There is an opinion that the experts do not "prick" for nefig.  This is not always true.  Most often, consultants who pretend to be experts do not prick.  Real, true experts often simply are not able to split.  Speaking in a civilized language, the experts can not give a clear, understandable answer, because most of the experts' experts act intuitively, without thinking.  Transforming experience, identified patterns and practices into intelligible speech is a complicated thing.  Recall, at least, a teacher from your university: it seems to be very experienced, but how to begin to explain, nothing is clear.  Not everyone is given this - the ability to explain.  Since we are talking more about IT people, it‚Äôs still worse.  Half of IT experts cannot speak.  Neither in Russian, nor in Ukrainian, nor in English. <br><br>  How to work ticks?  How a shoe works is understandable: ‚Äúa hedgehog is a proud bird, until you kick it, it will not fly‚Äù.  We project on our daily work: <br><br><ul><li>  the developer bird is proud, until you kick - the bug will not be fixed </li><li>  The client bird is proud, until you kick - the content for the site will not give. </li><li>  The head bird is proud, until you kick it - he will not add a person to the team. </li></ul><br><br>  Pliers are a much more complex tool than a shoe, because you have to think a lot with your head.  I work as ticks as follows: <br><br><ul><li>  Take your problem and apply your violent imagination to it.  In other words, imagine all sorts of solutions / developments.  What turned out is laid out into many small units of meaning.  With this all the good go to any tough nut, not wanting to give clear information. </li><li>  Begin carefully, in turn, to lay out one semantic unit after another in the form of questions.  You should get primitive questions that can answer yes / no, or give a short, monosyllabic answer.  In the worst case, you will be sent on an exotic trip.  In the best - you get a lot of small answers.  This is jigsaw puzzles.  Put jigsaw puzzles in your skullcap and put together the answer to your difficult question.  If the puzzles do not work out, contradict each other, or they are not enough for a full caritna - we start the iteration from the beginning. </li></ul><br>  <b>This is an important point.</b>  If the first time you have not received a clear answer, do not be afraid to repeat the question, paraphrase or return to it after a while.  It is better to be a stupid bore than a helpless manager.  Remember, your goal is to get information. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/4be/5b7/bd1/4be5b7bd1022534b815c724fcd55341b.jpg" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/125006/">https://habr.com/ru/post/125006/</a></p>
