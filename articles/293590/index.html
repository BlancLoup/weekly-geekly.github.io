How to promote a startup and attract investments?  How to quickly form a pool of brand advocates?  How to conduct branding and rebranding?  As you can see, this episode should be watched by the whole team at the meeting: marketers, PR specialists, designers, brand strategists will find a lot of informative and useful information for themselves.  Bonus for top managers: the episode contains a short course on the public presentation of large projects. <br><br><h2>  "Jared and his assistants," series "South Park", episode 2, season 6 </h2><br>  Within 20 minutes you will complete a full course on co-branding campaigns, as well as proper organization of work with the face of the brand.  But what kind of theory without practice?  In the center of the story - as many as 2 case studies: the federal campaign Subway and the regional campaign of the restaurant ShityWOK.  And you will learn how to carry out liposuction at home. <br><br><h2>  "17 moments of Spring" </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bd9/e36/f12/bd9e36f12c47403a918cd742c22bfb0b.jpg"><br><br>  Every spy is a very fast marketer.  At the heart of his success is the situational readiness phenomenon with a very short loop NORD, which is also sometimes called the Boyd cycle: ‚Äúobservation‚Äù - ‚Äúassessment of the situation‚Äù - ‚Äúdecision‚Äù - ‚Äúaction‚Äù.  The better the spy, the shorter the cycle and the shorter the reaction time, on which the agent's life depends.  If we take a closer look at Boyd‚Äôs cycle, we‚Äôll understand that marketers do the same thing when developing strategies, only sooo slow.  To get better, we look at the ‚Äú17 Moments of Spring‚Äù, in which Stirlitz skillfully uses the NORD loop, although he does not know about it. <br><br><h2>  Game of Thrones </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c07/010/f73/c07010f73ba24788ad447b2aabd9ed33.jpg"><br><br>  Thanks to the new marketing understanding of Game of Thrones, you can watch this series right at work in the time allotted for self-education.  And as long as others see only dragons, you will see the very essence. <br><br><ul><li>  Each House has its own positioning, supported by the logo and commercial message.  Moreover, these basic elements of communication platforms accurately reflect the Big ideas of each brand, and their brevity and rhythm allow you to memorize slogans from the first time: ‚ÄúWinter is coming‚Äù, ‚ÄúWe do not sow‚Äù.  Houses support their brands by constantly providing RTB.  From series to series, we observe how family strategies are developing, and at the end of the season we understand who managed to survive longer on the market. </li><li>  The financial insight of the Lannisters is an invaluable experience for media planners and strategists: the ability to properly allocate budgets, calculate ROMI for each tool, competently invest in the right channels.  And most importantly, the payment of debts as a solid foundation for reputation management. </li><li>  Each House is brilliantly marketing territories: all market players accurately represent where one or another family is based and how to get to it, and also how the terrain reflects the character of the brand. </li></ul><br>  As a viewer, that is, as an expert in the market, looking at all business processes from the outside, you can work out a lot of military strategies and tactics, find new solutions, evaluate the situation holistically and train skills in anti-crisis marketing. <br><br><h2>  Breaking Bad </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e93/1ab/72a/e931ab72a0934540bc6b713b2a78c491.jpg"><br><br>  Find your niche, put together a team, organize all business processes - now you can approach the management of a marketing agency from an academic point of view (the main character is a doctor of chemical sciences - he won't advise the bad). <br><br><ul><li>  The right choice of business partners: form a team of people-opposites so that they fully complement each other and be important for business. </li><li>  Search for new markets.  Here, of course, one cannot do without the emphasis on the fact that connections decide everything.  But a good audit of the market and the search for a free niche became the basis for the success of the main characters of Walter and Jesse. </li><li>  Work with competitors.  Do not think that we offer to arrange a shootout and destroy competitors in a figurative sense.  Recall better negotiations, dialogues and monologues from the series: the ability to convince with a word, to build trust in oneself with the properly cited arguments - and competitors can become excellent partners in the future. </li><li>  The advertising message ‚ÄúBetter Call Saul‚Äù became the name and idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa separate series, which underlines the excellent positioning of a lawyer who could teach himself and knew how to work correctly with non-standard clients. </li></ul><br><br><h2>  "Better call Saul" (Better Call Saul) </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a81/381/d6e/a81381d6efd840bd95e6b7358ac8dbf2.jpg"><br><br>  Recommended to all startups.  Starting a business is always difficult, especially when there is high competition, minimal start-up budgets, and there is no close partner.  How to be?  Do not despair, remain faithful to your principles and include a little bit of fantasy to search for a free target audience.  The main character of the series, Saul, found his niche as a lawyer: he became a lawyer for retired single or abandoned relatives!  The right approach to the target audience (lonely pensioners need to be kind and attentive to all their problems, they are not well versed in laws and afraid to be deceived by their relatives), patience (for example, wait until the old woman rises to the second floor and descends back ), well-built communications (for example, Saul placed an advertisement at the bottom of jars of yoghurt, which he brought to the nursing home for free) ‚Äîthat will be the recipe for success. <br><br><h2>  "Force majeure" (Suits) </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/104/3d6/e51/1043d6e5137d4957930e3be45f3a70c5.jpg"><br><br>  ‚ÄúMad Men‚Äù in a modern way, but in the main roles - a couple of lawyers: one - the shark of the world of jurisprudence Harvey Spectr, the second - the genius-dropout Mike Ross, the new trainee of the company with a criminal past.  There are many similarities between marketers and lawyers: both of them play on shades and nuances of truth, balancing on the verge of what is permitted. <br><br>  We are "Force Majeure" interesting, above all, impeccable customer service and focus on work not from call to call, but on the result.  Relaxing while watching does not work: you constantly analyze what is happening and ask yourself the question ‚ÄúWhat would I have done?‚Äù. <br><br>  <i>One of the best quotes of the series:</i> <i><br></i>  <i>‚ÄúWhen a pistol is applied to your temple, you take it away, or you pull out your pistol, or you bluff, or do something else from the remaining 146 options.‚Äù</i> <br><br><h2>  ‚ÄúRay Donovan‚Äù (Ray Donovan) </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cb6/245/466/cb62454661564d4c81e7c1eb6924e266.jpg"><br><br>  The series is for those who do not yet believe in networking.  The main character, Ray, clearly shows us how to build up a circle of social ties, as well as competently use it to achieve our goals.  Almost in every episode, thanks to his contacts, he solves the problems of clients, on which he earns.  In Russia, well, just an irreplaceable skill. <br><br><h2>  "Underground Empire" (Boardwalk Empire) </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/18e/0c5/825/18e0c5825a044717a30fda3ec25eafef.jpg"><br><br>  America of the twenties of the last century, where the ‚Äúdry law‚Äù dominates, is the ideal place and time for extreme marketing and <a href="http://takethecake.ru/solutions/strategy">strategic planning</a> in an aggressive competitive environment.  The ‚Äúunderground empire‚Äù is a 5-seasons case on how to sell a product that the consumer desperately needs, but outside of the law and in an underground underground business saturated with competitors. <br><br>  Sophisticated story-throttling will be liked by strategists, who with passion will evaluate and analyze the ups and downs in the fate of the Empire, wondering what techniques can be transferred to their professional practice. <br><br><h2>  Lie to me </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ab5/c3e/0dc/ab5c3e0dc469407a9d61e6c6e5345cb1.jpg"><br><br>  An x-ray machine should be built into every marketer to let you know for sure if your opponent is lying and no matter who: friend, girlfriend, business partner or just a passerby.  The ability to recognize false will protect the strategist from actions or decisions that can cause a lot of trouble.  ‚ÄúLie to me‚Äù is the textbook with which you can pump the internal lie detector. <br><br>  In addition to the series, we recommend reading Paul Ekman's two books, The Psychology of Lies.  You will be able to track the interlocutor's reaction and see how his own body gives out when he lies.  The most interesting thing in this process is not to show your opponent that you have seen it through.  The performance can go on for a very long time, but you are no longer a victim, but a director, and you can stop it at any time. <br><br><h2>  The Last Ship </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/033/f82/f47/033f82f4796e4006a7c473dcb1c27e6e.jpg"><br><br>  Visual aids on team building.  In order to unite, any team - heroes or villains - just need a common goal that affects the interests of each team member.  And you also need a leader - the one who has the biggest cockroaches in his head, in other words, this person should be charismatic. <br><br><h2>  "Sharp Visors" (Peaky Blinders) </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a5e/f9c/8fc/a5ef9c8fca2d4cf8be70e20b4fe6541e.jpg"><br><br>  The charismatic gangster Tommy Shelby, considered from the right angle, is a great example of a strong leader for business owners in our country.  He can: <br><br><ul><li>  find new niches on the blue ocean strategy, just like Kim Wichang; </li><li>  to lead the team, bringing to it their ideas, which at first glance seem insane; </li><li>  to build negotiations in the right way; </li><li>  smear competitors or turn them into partners - whichever is more profitable for the business. </li></ul><br>  In general, 12 episodes of pure pleasure called "How to do business in Russia."  Deviating from the topic of the article, we note that this is one of the highest quality TV shows of the XXth century, and it can be safely put on a par with Mad Men, True Detective and Game of Thrones.  And it should be noted the bright naming of his gang - ‚ÄúPeaky Blinders‚Äù.  I feel like saying: ‚ÄúI would have entered!‚Äù <br><br><h2>  Mad Men </h2><br><br>  Employees of one of the best advertising agencies in New York, a sample of the 1960s, suffer from spiritual devastation, are experiencing a volatile era, and sell excellent advertising to it.  How to do the first, second and third - you can learn from the "madmen".  A typical example of emotional branding from the series: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/d3iGxmuIX-k%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhULdKNexSv6lePBm70EmVaQ0VMLA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h2>  "Crazy" (The Crazy Ones) </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3e4/302/078/3e43020789ac4e8cb5502ac522b41dee.jpg"><br><br>  Having learned to do marketing in New York, go to Chicago.  Despite the fact that the television series has existed for only 22 episodes, we have 22 half-hour selected cases, from which it is possible to create a training plan for the month. <br><br><h2>  "House MD" (House MD) </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7fc/3f9/488/7fc3f9488ac44195997facb0854d8c88.jpg"><br><br>  In addition to the fact that Vicodin is an excellent tool for productive brainstorming, the Dr. House TV series teaches us how to properly brief clients.  Often, without realizing it, they keep back key things for the strategist or embellish the product, harming not only themselves, but also their company.  The task of the marketing team is to pull out the necessary information from the client's patient to form a healthy strategy. <br><br>  Despite the fact that Dr. House is a bright leader and an eminent diagnostician, he cannot work without his team, and all his brilliant ideas are born only during the discussion.  It often happens that it is the team that influences the correct diagnosis.  For the success of any project, do not underestimate the power of the team and brainstorming (and here we gracefully loop back the review and return to the first paragraph). <br><br><h2>  "American Family" (Modern Family) </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/246/df4/a5a/246df4a5a90e4816b742f948839da16c.jpg"><br><br>  Studying the target audience, and you need inspiration for the formation of insights and building communications?  Look behind the scenes of the average family, see what problems they face every day and how they solve them.  The pseudo-documentary of the series makes it possible to understand why this or that hero did just that, because all the characters comment on their actions.  Only everyday situations are shown - from finding a job to organizing a big holiday: no superheroes, aliens, dragons.  Just life.  Special attention to marketers should be paid to the hero Phil, who is the seller of houses.  He uses a lot of advertising tricks, and we see the consequences of an unsuccessful choice of advertising message or advertising medium. <br><br>  You will say: ‚ÄúBut this is an American family, is it really possible to transfer insight to a Russian audience?‚Äù The fact is that there is no typical American behavior or American humor that we dislike in the series.  The issue of the series is international, remember, like Tolstoy‚Äôs: ‚ÄúAll happy families are alike, each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way‚Äù.  So, here the families are happy). <br><br>  * The article was first published in the corporate blog, you read a special version for the "Megamind" * </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/293590/">https://habr.com/ru/post/293590/</a></p>
