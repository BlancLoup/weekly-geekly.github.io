I am a workaholic by nature, in which, of course, there are both positive and negative sides.  One of the positive aspects - I can not give myself a break and do nothing for a whole day.  On the other hand, work without rest and clear goals reduces motivation, and, of course, tires.  That is why I decided to trust the good old saying and try to become better. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5ee/ebd/910/5eeebd910f1841d1af20df5ea4bb740f.png">

      To become an excellent designer is a serious challenge.  Becoming known and recognized is even more difficult.  In the field of digital design there are so many narrow specialties with many categories of designers who, each in their field, make a name for themselves.  Some of them are great web designers, others are great UI designers if they concentrate on animation, and so on.  How to find yourself among a huge number of successful people, and what excites you more, how to succeed in such a competitive environment? <br><br>  The answer to this question: work, work and work again.  Of course, talent helps.  But it is persistence and work that separates a good designer from a great one. <br><br>  What I want to share is my story about how I began my path, about personal and professional growth. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/de7/881/785/de788178597946659e10c2b31d573231.png"><br>  <i>This illustration is my first step in Dribbble.</i> <br><br><h4>  Practice </h4><br>  The obvious advantage of working in a creative and eminent digital agency - your environment forces you to improve at every step.  Your colleagues are experts in your field, and least of all you would like to fall behind.  The competitive environment acts as an extremely positive incentive. <br><br>  I wanted to be one of those amazing people.  I knew that I needed to develop my creative potential and promote myself as a designer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ad7/f1d/a17/ad7f1da17c8b42d4bebf0b48eb099e50.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/538/169/4df/5381694df7f448ab809484d3b069f20f.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/006/dd8/b25/006dd8b25bd44ba4970670fb52031234.png"><br><br>  The first thing that came to mind was training.  When I go to the gym, I often see athletes who train daily, developing dexterity, strength and coordination.  The same with musicians.  They repeat their compositions until they begin to play them from memory.  Practicing in various occupations, we learn new things, new movements.  Our brain creates new synoptic connections, and we begin to see the problem in a new light, in other words - we develop our creativity. <br><br><blockquote>  Practice does not lead to perfection.  Only perfect practice leads to perfection.  Vince Lombardi </blockquote><br><br><h4>  Come up with a test </h4><br>  Being motivated to action is just as critical if you want to grow and develop.  I need such a test to have to surpass myself.  I also need to be clear on the end goal.  When you develop an application, you know perfectly well what you expect from the final product.  Many fine points will have to be settled and combed during the course of the project, but your goal should be clear.  In my case, this means that I need to come up with a design project that will require transcending myself. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/059/bbd/16a/059bbd16a3ae4792b88dd3e1d620731a.png"><br>  <i>The first published illustration.</i> <br><br>  This is how the project <a href="http://icon-a-day.com/">icon-a-day.com</a> appeared. <br><br>  The initial idea was to create a simple icon every day for a year, using Adobe Illustrator as the main tool.  The concept is simple: the circle in which I fit the icon.  Themes of illustrations are completely different.  I must confess that in the beginning I was not sure that this would lead to anything.  But the main goal was to improve the skills in digital graphics.  I wanted to make different illustrations in order to master several styles.  I learned my capabilities (and continue to learn them). <br><br>  Since the project began, he has practically lived his own life.  Creating icons was my second self, almost like brushing my teeth every morning. <br><br>  Although the initial idea was simple icons, over time they grew into full-scale illustrations. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eca/0e7/7b1/eca0e77b14e44e3cb4a4d4ad1380c347.png"><br>  <i>Sketch.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5d1/701/071/5d17010718844d07aa60df3e241465fc.png"><br>  <i>Finished illustration.</i> <br><br><h4>  Know your abilities </h4><br>  Naturally, the work on such a project in personal time entails a certain number of problems.  The biggest problem for me is finding time.  Working from 9 to 5, you realize that time is not really infinite.  Your day may be overloaded with personal or work responsibilities.  It is very difficult to invest all that you have in the project alone. <br><br>  One of the pitfalls of a long-term project is the loss of motivation and the inevitable loss of quality.  The key task is to always remain focused on the main goal and publish the icon at the end of the day no matter what. <br><br>  Staying persistent throughout the project is a challenge in itself.  I started with simple icons, but as I developed, I learned new techniques for applying shadows, filters, effects, etc. <br><br>  These examples show the progress I have made from the beginning to the present: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3af/9e4/eb3/3af9e4eb3af74528af7be6eee271088e.png"><br>  <i>Day 3</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1cb/c02/24e/1cbc0224edb94fea95b7ac5373645aa7.png"><br>  <i>Day 25</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4b2/706/cd5/4b2706cd50354e008ae4646c5bee1bdb.png"><br>  <i>Day 111</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/33a/803/958/33a803958370424ea4bc7c583c0e6989.png"><br>  <i>Day 168</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5c0/42f/9ca/5c042f9ca73141dda405df466ff5b21c.png"><br>  <i>Day 214</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2a1/634/fde/2a1634fdebe8421088f58d2bb75c6343.png"><br>  <i>Day 286</i> <br><br><h4>  Take obligations </h4><br>  You must remain obligatory in your work.  Finding motivation for action every day is difficult.  I realized that self-promotion helps to cope with this task.  Publishing your work on social networks like <a href="http://icon-a-day.com/">Tumblr</a> , <a href="https://twitter.com/icon_a_day">Twitter</a> , <a href="https://www.behance.net/sweetness-every-day">Behance</a> or <a href="https://dribbble.com/sweetness-every-day">Dribbble</a> gives you a wide audience.  Recognition from the side imposes obligations on you to continue the project. <br><br>  I started my blog on Tumblr, where I posted icons daily.  I was able to easily see my progress during these 365 days, besides this is a good way to show the work to other people.  In addition to Tumblr, the illustrations, which I consider to be a success, fall on Dribbble - this community is more oriented towards designers.  When you publish your work online, you have a certain audience of subscribers, and, as a rule, your popularity as a designer grows. <br><br>  If I missed one day, I would have found a reservation to skip another one and so on.  Be true to your business and it will pay off. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3fc/ba6/7cb/3fcba67cb7234cdc8c91aaaf8be98746.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a71/beb/a41/a71beba41848425c8e4340ff1e04a266.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c54/8c1/dba/c548c1dbad5a4c71b7d37a28f3b0b88e.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2c5/cfb/a86/2c5cfba86ba84b54885d481e87199c23.png"><br><br><h4>  Enlist the support of friends </h4><br>  If you are starting a long-term project, there is a risk that friends will be skeptical about it.  Do not fall into this trap.  Friends play a big role in your development.  You need to surround yourself with people who will encourage your work.  People who will see the point in your project and will give you advice when you come across a creative crisis, and believe me, there will be days when this crisis will happen. <br><br>  No matter how good you are in your business.  There are times when you encounter obstacles that you cannot overcome.  That's when the participation of friends and colleagues is important.  They can show / offer a new solution, give the right advice. <br><br>  Although my project takes time, I have not lost friends because of it.  Quite the contrary, I started several new ones during the project, especially in the design environment. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b68/3f3/873/b683f387336b4f7b9daf04c4c1e90dc0.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Realize the result </h4><br>  It may seem that you do not get more from your project than personal growth.  You will be surprised how you can get a result by starting something to do.  In addition to the disclosure of creativity that could sleep all this time, there are many other things that can happen on the way to your personal goal. <br><br>  As for me, I became stronger in the illustration, I learned to animate my icons (it was a small third-party project that my colleagues helped me with), I met many new creative people and opened the doors to the design community.  The project found a commercial side: people liked the illustrations, and they wanted to get the right to use or hire me to make illustrations to order.  I also started selling my icons on Society6, where you can meet them on various household items, such as mugs, watches, and bedspreads. <br><br>  All the consequences of this work have led to increased self-confidence.  The end result of the project covers small negative moments that can happen on the way. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/713/a69/5b8/713a695b883b47dbbc39fc3a1bb1eace.gif"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ae5/e3c/486/ae5e3c48680e4ee28b9b914e81fcf858.gif"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/544/3ed/bc4/5443edbc4b974f94a4980f64e184d88c.gif"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/489/091/b80/489091b80d1a45f79127f158560ac8c1.gif"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/683/735/e70/683735e7026c4990b313c57788671b7c.gif"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8ea/c32/e8e/8eac32e8e70546d7916d9829ec96cbe2.gif"><br><br><h4>  The end of a long journey </h4><br>  If someone told me a year ago that I would create one illustration per day, I would most likely not believe it.  I did not realize what progress I can achieve in such a short time. <br><br>  Colleagues from work ask me: what will you do when you finish your 365th icon? <br><br>  Fair?  I dont know.  Probably, I will find myself another goal, a new test that will make me better, already in the new field of digital design. <br><br>  What I can say for sure is that the icon-a-day project has become my great achievement, and I recommend everyone to start their own project.  Life is a process of lifelong learning, and such goals help us expand our own boundaries.  This gives us growth, both professional and personal. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/264741/">https://habr.com/ru/post/264741/</a></p>
