  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Bought> filled> in your pocket! Review PocketBook 515</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Do you like to read from your smartphone, but because of this he does not live to see the evening, and his eyes get tired?  Do not like big reading rooms, because they can not be removed in your pocket?  Especially for you are available pocket readers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dca/90e/2ae/dca90e2ae412b5c7746e804fd0e6b294.jpg" alt="nKP0sem2.jpg"><br><br>  It is not expensive, a screen with a familiar 4: 3 aspect ratio (like a classic paper book), advanced E-Ink displays with good contrast ratios, and most importantly - you need to charge it once a week.  And the smartphone does not need to torment.  On one such branch of the library in pocket size today and talk. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Appearance and body </h4><br>  Few people care about the appearance of the reader, this is, after all, not a status Vertu or a new iPhone, but a purely utilitarian thing.  In my case, the 515th was a strange green with an orange button, but the manufacturer has other color solutions: graphite gray and white cases with light green edging buttons.

      All controls are concentrated at the bottom of the device - an on / off microbutton, a five-way D-Pad with a central "menu" button, buttons to the left and right of the D-Pad that have slightly noticeable risks in the form of up and down arrows.  At the bottom is also located Micro USB connector for charging and syncing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ac5/226/e28/ac5226e28d15ac4233fc6215cbdbe2e1.jpg" alt="h5YzKgcOB.jpg"><br><br>  Otherwise, the reader is like a reader, plastic is moderately so-called, the tactile sensations are ‚Äúordinary‚Äù, you can't call it pleasant or nasty. <br><br><h4>  Display </h4><br>  Five inches, 800x600 points, E-Ink of the last (at the time of release in 2013) generation, there is no backlight.  Rendering speed, contrast and clarity - like everyone else.  On a sunny day, in a room with the lights off in the afternoon, in the evening at the floor lamp or in the subway readability is excellent, in the dark, respectively, zero. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ae8/96f/0b1/ae896f0b18bce519072403bdb529df2a.jpg" alt="M7OR.jpg"><br><br>  Due to the smoothing function of the fonts, there are no teeth on the letters, in general, the sensations of using the book for its intended purpose are the most pleasant: the picture is refreshed quickly, looks smooth, and the eyes do not get tired. <br><br><h4>  Soft </h4><br>  Inside is a typical PocketBook.  The book comes out of sleep instantly, 15 seconds are loaded from the ‚Äúoff‚Äù state, the menu, settings, applications and the reader itself are the same as the older brothers, except that there is no touch control on it, only buttons, only hardcore.  I know that many people have a negative attitude towards touchscreen readers, but poking at the desired menu item (in my opinion) is much more convenient than moving around in an array of rows and columns of the main screen using the D-Pad.  As an additional alternative, I would not give up the resistive sensor, specifically for navigating through the menu and in all sorts of applications: calculator / search / pointers / notes and similar features. <br><br><h4>  Management, navigation, features </h4><br>  The main screen, like all other screens, in fact, almost completely repeat what I saw in other readers of this company.  Such continuity pleases, changing the model does not have long to get used to the new interface.  Minor improvements, of course, produce, but the main list of functions and their location remains unchanged. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ae8/96f/0b1/ae896f0b18bce519072403bdb529df2a.jpg" alt="M7OR.jpg"><br><br>  Homescreen contains a list of recent books, a menu of four items below it, and the status bar is even lower, displaying the date, time, and battery status. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/634/858/1b6/6348581b66908c442c61293b201803a4.jpg" alt="xOd4Yyf.jpg"><br><br>  In some places, the left and right buttons on the D-Pad duplicate the functions of the buttons to the left and right of the central five-position control, in others, they are responsible for navigating the menu, and the buttons on the case are behind the back "And" forward "on the history of screens.  The solution is not perfect, but you can use it, a matter of habit.  The menu bar contains the items "Library", "Notes", "Applications" and "Settings", in principle, their functions are understandable by name, but let's take a quick look at the internal screens. <br><br><h4>  Library </h4><br>  The library is formed, as I have already said, similar to the rest of the poketbooks ‚Äî the folder tree, the control via the D-Pad, the redrawing of the menu items almost instantly, everything is intuitively clear. <br><br><h4>  Notes </h4><br>  It contains your book clippings.  Without a touchscreen display, it‚Äôs hard to make comfortable notes, but you can handle it.  The presence of features is not an absence, so let it be. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0f7/9ab/560/0f79ab5609af2dc39a973ed74bf6ba6c.jpg" alt="XTb6P0.jpg"><br><br>  Navigation, similar to the library, is done via the D-Pad, you can return to the main menu with the button to the left of it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/86f/53f/615/86f53f615820e6ea688b7df80ed8d917.jpg" alt="hbBYw.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Applications </h4><br>  Again, the list of applications coincides with other readers, there are a calculator, a dictionary, a calendar clock and several toys: chess, kerchief, snake and sudoku. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0b5/bc9/fa4/0b5bc9fa43291318be3ab94b15d9466f.jpg" alt="ucGp9U4.jpg"><br><br>  The image viewer is there, but, of course, it‚Äôs impossible to enjoy the full-color presentation of the images, but rather, to read comics in the form of JPEG cuts.  In it, by the way, the buttons to the left and right of the central one are responsible for scrolling, and the output is carried out through the central button of the D-Pad. <br><br>  The screen update speed is excellent, ‚Äúghostingom‚Äù does not suffer, here <a href="">‚Äôs</a> a two and a half meter <a href="">gif</a> . <br><br><h4>  Settings </h4><br>  Actually, the settings are the settings.  You can ottyunit almost everything that is available to the reader: in the personalization section, what to show when you turn on (menu or the last book), screensaver, font, reassign some buttons in applications;  in the rest - system and near-system functions, DRM-protection and select the interface language.  As a nice bonus, you can enable multi-user mode and not suffer from porridge in the notes, the history of books and other "personal" data.  Trifle, but nice. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/36b/d8b/bfb/36bd8bbfb49180db2b3bb98e9e64bdef.jpg" alt="1RvFtNW0.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ce8/899/0b2/ce88990b22fef5b8e12d26855ceec8d0.jpg" alt="QGBXztUw.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Oh pleasant and not so </h4><br>  The reader is small, smart, perfectly displays text and pictures, fits into the pocket of your jacket, jacket, coat, or even into the front pocket of jeans, if you try (although I would not recommend keeping the reader there, it‚Äôs difficult to damage the screen, but you can). <br><br>  The advantages are: omnivorous popular formats (thanks to FBReader, built in as the main application for reading), PDF support, the capabilities of older models, compact size, small frames (for which you can still hold the reader without obscuring the display), the ability to work in landscape mode (and support for a "flipped" left-handed album). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2be/e66/d26/2bee66d26bf831867767c48ebf21be76.jpg" alt="XsNIk4.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/17d/aa0/1c2/17daa01c252b131aa37d0fadb8bfd0e2.jpg" alt="bW71eHI.jpg"><br><br>  Of course, this also applies to the price (only two and a half thousand wooden).  The built-in memory of honest 4096 megabytes, of which almost  are accessible to the user, at least learn. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/af0/1a3/a7f/af01a3a7fc5a12bb998e1d006e03014d.jpg" alt="o0b2qePz.jpg"><br><br>  There are also disadvantages: a ‚Äúcreaky‚Äù build (although it may be a cant of my test copy, which is finished with reviewers and regular shipments with couriers), fingerprints remain on the back cover (although who cares about the reader?), There is no way to plug in headphones and listen to audiobooks (although now every phone / smartphone can reproduce them, the loss is not great).  No memory card slot. <br><br>  My opinion?  If you need a book "pocket" format - take it, you will not regret.  It is not expensive, smart, long-playing, excellent high-contrast display with an almost paper-white substrate.  Well, if you have not yet decided on a gift for the New Year ... You know that the best gift is a book.  And the best book is just an e-book.  All with the coming. <br><br>  <b>PS:</b> The broken area on the display is from the previous reviewer.  I do not know how he managed to leave a mark. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/207330/">https://habr.com/ru/post/207330/</a></p>
