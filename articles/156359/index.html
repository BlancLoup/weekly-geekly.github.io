I think many of you know that Google recently <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/apps4all/blog/155239/">announced an event</a> under the slogan "Playground is open", which will be held on October 29th.  I decided to collect all the rumors hovering around this presentation in one post.  And so, under the cut, you will learn about the <s>scandals, intrigues, investigations of</s> Android 4.2, two completely new devices and one updated. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cc5/f7b/682/cc5f7b682e38441cbd8e4c1e439b2189.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Just want to clarify that all of the below are rumors, leaks and squeeze from the news sites of mobile subjects.  Do not take this information as the ultimate truth.  Do not build high hopes and will not be disappointed.

      So, let's begin. <br><br><h4>  <font color="blue">‚ñå</font> Nexus 7 with 3G and 32GB of memory </h4><br><h5>  Appearance </h5><br>  It all started with the fact that a buyer from Japan received a 32GB version of Nexus 7 by mistake.  According to the documents it was a device with 16GB of memory, but the memory information showed 27.58GB of free space. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bdb/fb4/378/bdbfb4378152543a7c1998772f11289f.jpg"><br><br><h5>  Intrigue </h5><br>  A little later, in the Google Play store, the 8GB version of the device was labeled ‚ÄúComing soon‚Äù.  In itself, this event would mean nothing, but in the store Staples, which is located in the USA, a box with a 32GB device surfaced and a document instructing the removal of the 8GB version from the sale. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3ee/a01/f5c/3eea01f5c7588ce0f35039b6e76a82ef.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/443/d5e/bc8/443d5ebc8970ee4eba334a16f7c7abe6.jpg"><br><br>  It seems that the 16GB version will replace the version with 8GB with a price tag of $ 199, and the maximum bundle will be 32GB with a price tag of $ 249. <br><br><h5>  Now with a SIM card slot </h5><br>  But is it just a matter of memory?  On the Federal Communications Commission website, a device that is certified to use the 3G module, with code number ME370T <b>G, has</b> surfaced.  Considering that the original Nexus 7 has the serial number of the ME370T, there is no need to think long about what awaits us at the presentation. <br><br><h5>  Take my money! </h5><br>  Seven-inch tablet with support from Google, with a 3G module and 32GB of memory, yummy!  Question remains only the price.  Will the ‚Äúpumped‚Äù model remain within the ‚Äúavailability‚Äù that the Nexus 7 showed us initially? <br><br>  <b>UPD</b> : A photo appeared with a price of 32GB model.  ¬£ 199.99, pretty good, eh? <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d76/783/ae4/d76783ae4580047f34030bbaa72b94a0.jpg"><br><br><h4>  <font color="pink">‚ñå</font> Nexus 10 or Retina Display smokes on the sidelines </h4><br><h5>  Secretive </h5><br>  This device remained a secret for a long time.  At first, it appeared in the server logs of the <a href="http://androidpolice.com/">androidpolice.com</a> site, code-named Manta, then - photos with EXIF ‚Äã‚Äãtag Model - ‚ÄúNexus 10‚Äù surfaced on the network.  A couple of days ago, a photo of the user's manual of this device, in which the location of the elements on the case is indicated, leaked. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/835/ce9/bb3/835ce9bb3b3010211ebecee00aba7877.jpg"><br><br><h5>  Show me your face </h5><br>  And only today there were real photos of the device from the guys from Brief Mobile: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d9b/7da/2f5/d9b7da2f580963ed1b61e208f9525694.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dd4/f32/79b/dd4f3279b4524641787af911cb136316.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2eb/a81/4a5/2eba814a59721fd6f759e9f8f2b9b134.jpg"><br><br><h5>  Filling </h5><br>  Expected device performance: <br><ul><li>  Android 4.2, build on October 24 </li><li>  Dual-core Exynos 5250 processor with a clock speed of 1.7GHz </li><li>  Mali T604 GPU video chip </li><li>  RAM: 2GB </li><li>  16GB of memory (there may be other modifications) </li><li>  10.1 "Super AMOLED screen with <s>good bye</s> resolution <s>, iPad</s> 2560x1600 and ppi ~ 300 </li><li>  Rear camera with a 5MP matrix (front camera specifications are unknown) </li><li>  NFC </li></ul><br>  Unfortunately, there is no information about the price of this device. <br><br><h4>  <font color="yellow">‚ñå</font> Nexus 4 from LG </h4><br><h5>  Traveler </h5><br>  With a smartphone from LG turned out quite a mysterious story.  He somehow appeared in Belarus, from where the first photos of the device were taken: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/522/251/2d8/5222512d8095473721e59ec53adfe69e.jpeg"><br><br><h5>  Price </h5><br>  Somewhere a week later, the smartphone lit up in the database of the Carphone warehouse, with a price of ¬£ 389, which is about $ 628. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d80/7f0/ec4/d807f0ec4da9d8f2b915349db0067e3c.png"><br><br>  Also on the website of the company the opportunity to pre-order.  They promise to start sending on October 30, i.e.  just a day after the presentation. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/055/85b/e80/05585be803fb0df976815cf07b4e9ac2.png"><br><br>  Today, in the <a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks">@evleaks</a> twitter account, the final, according to their assertions, smartphone render <a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks">has</a> been published. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f1a/6de/fad/f1a6defad0237b69263c8a5cc761a5f3.png"><br><br>  <b>UPD</b> : The first video with the new Nexus 4: <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/SAR2azfZdmk&amp;xid=25657,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhhKNgR0bBqTS_57Fe5DBrvJ3Hivjg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h5>  Power </h5><br>  Characteristics of the smartphone are as follows: <br><ul><li>  4.7 "screen with a resolution of 1280x768 </li><li>  Four-core Snapdragon S4 Pro processor </li><li>  Adreno 320 GPU video chip </li><li>  2GB RAM </li><li>  8GB / 16GB internal memory </li><li>  Main camera - 8MP, front - 1.3MP </li><li>  2100mAh battery </li><li>  9.1mm thickness </li><li>  Android 4.2 Jelly Bean </li></ul><br><br><h4>  <font color="red">‚ñå</font> New Android 4.2 Jelly Bean </h4><br>  Yes, the new version of the OS is likely to have the same name.  No major changes are foreseen, this is work on improving the current version of Android.  There are rumors about the following changes: <br><br><h5>  Updated Gmail Application </h5><br>  Recently, a new version of Gmail client has leaked to the network.  Of the new "buns" it is worth noting: <br><ul><li>  Approaching letters ‚Äúpinch‚Äù </li><li>  The type of images attached to the letter has changed.  Preview icons are bigger, clearer <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/daa/945/f4a/daa945f4aae0a9e08a86a1580d0eb2a4.png"></li><li>  To archive or delete a letter, now simply swipe through it from left to right. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/700/bc5/13e/700bc513e319699a25ae4e942ad19677.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b1a/3a1/674/b1a3a16748a6b201a7021eb622ee5e64.png"><br><br></li></ul><br><h5>  Updated gallery application </h5><br>  The gallery has undergone a redesign that brings the appearance of the application to the gallery in the Google+ client. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2a4/6b5/cf3/2a46b5cf3b5975c1457014b7eeb1c94e.png"><br><br><h5>  Second curtain for ‚Äúquick settings‚Äù </h5><br>  An option that is shrouded in mystery.  When re-pulling the notification curtain, the user should get access to the quick settings.  Most likely, it will be something similar to switches in CyanogenMod or in shells from vendors, like Samsung or LG.  In the lost version, on the site of these settings, there was just a stub picture. <br><br><h5>  Custom profiles for tablets </h5><br>  It is no secret that the blanks for the system profiles appeared in the Android code back in 2011.  The new version of the OS should allow changing the device settings and the list of installed applications depending on the selected user profile.  Also, we are likely to see "parental control", which will complement and make safer multi-profiling system. <br><br><h5>  Security enhancements </h5><br>  Google is working hard on Android security.  So, recently, a malware scanner has been added to the server side of Google Play.  Also, lines were found in the Google Play client that indicate that the verification of applications already installed on the device for malware will be available soon.  The leaked OS version found evidence that SELinux modules will be added to the kernel, which will restrict program access to system files, minimizing the possibility of harming data.  Also, the new version of the OS should please people who constantly use VPN, it will have options for using the Internet only when VPN is available. <br>  We should also see the option to confirm the sending of messages to short numbers.  This is great to limit malicious programs that send expensive SMS.  Now the pests will be powerless, unless the user himself allows sending. <br><br><h4>  <font color="purple">‚ñå</font> Summing the line </h4><br>  Many of these rumors and leaks look very plausible, some not so.  The dissemination of information in our time occurs at lightning speed, so it is possible that even a giant like Google is not able to keep all the secrets.  I am glad that the presentation will take place very, very soon, and all controversial points will become clear.  I also hope that not all the interesting things that have been shown to us at the presentation got into the network.  A pair of trumps up their sleeve at Google should be, right? <br><br>  When writing the article materials from the sites <a href="http://androidpolice.com/">androidpolice.com</a> , <a href="http://briefmobile.com/">briefmobile.com</a> and <a href="http://nexusnews.ru/">nexusnews.ru were used</a> . <br>  Thank you for taking the time to read this article.  If you find a typo - write to the LAN, always ready to correct. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/156359/">https://habr.com/ru/post/156359/</a></p>
