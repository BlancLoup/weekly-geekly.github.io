  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Earth in the information blockade?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  First, a few numbers and brief information.  To whip up the fantasy. <br>  Khe-khe.  Our galaxy is called the Milky Way and has in its composition, according to various estimates, from 200 to 400 billion stars.  Of these, type G stars, like our Sun, are about 5% (that is, at the lowest estimate 10 ^ 10 such stars).  At least 30% of these stars have planets, and this estimate is likely to be underestimated, as with modern technology, scientists discover only large planets.  Based on infrared studies, it is estimated that from 20% to 60% of solar-type stars can form planets like our Earth.  By the most conservative estimates, this is somehow the billions of planets suitable for life. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/07c/b5f/5dc/07cb5f5dceb9abb6d81257e2ecb3fed5.jpg" alt="The Milky Way is shaped like a spiral."><br>  <i>The milky way has the shape of a spiral.</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Although, of course, this does not mean that it is there, because for the emergence of a carbon form of life similar to us, and its evolution to a high level, a combination of <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2593%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0_%25D1%2583%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B9_%25D0%2597%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8">many factors</a> and a lot of time is necessary (at least 4.5 billion years).  But this compensates for the moment that many scientists look at life rather narrowly, suggesting that for its occurrence it is necessary to copy the earthly conditions.  This is a wrong, and not at all scientific approach to business, which is proved by the fact that such intelligent people, like Tsiolkovsky, for example, put forward hypotheses about the possibility of the existence of other life forms, such as <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B4">plasma ones</a> .  And this is still more likely confirmed than refuted.  At this moment, by the way, everyone should be ashamed of earthly cinema, where 95% of aliens are humanoids (galactic intolerance?). <br>  In addition to the information above, it is worth mentioning that our Milky Way is only one of 30,000 galaxies (approximately the same size, just imagine it) the Virgo Supercluster, which, in turn, is not the only supercluster in the Universe, naturally. <br>  With such figures, it is quite funny to think about whether we are alone in the Universe.  From my point of view, the answer is absolutely obvious.  True distance to closest friends may be such that humanity has a chance not to live to contact ever. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7d0/988/fd0/7d0988fd0e0c86c8003cd6b41802a751.jpg" alt="Hubble Space Telescope"><br>  <i>Over 10,000 galaxies.</i>  <i>Exposure&gt; million seconds.</i>  <i>Space Telescope Hubl.</i> <i><br></i>  <i><a href="">Full version 18 MB</a></i>

      Let's go back to our galaxy.  As many great minds thought about sabzh, <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BA%25D1%2581_%25D1%2584%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8">the Fermi principle</a> was finally formed, that is, a paradox that sounds like: <br>  <i>The combination of the common belief that there is a significant number of technologically advanced civilizations in the Universe, with the absence of any observations that would confirm it, is paradoxical and leads to the conclusion that either our understanding of nature or our observations are incomplete and erroneous.</i> <br>  Within the framework of this paradox, many theories have appeared, the proof of any of which would explain it, but all of them, of course, remain only assumptions.  There is even the well-known <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A3%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5_%25D0%2594%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0">Drake Equation</a> , which according to modern estimates gives a chance of 0.002275 for the existence of intelligent life in the galaxy. <br>  However, I will adhere to the opinion that the Drake equation is quite far from reality, because it is based almost entirely on assumptions and does not take into account the most important thing - the paucity of human knowledge at this stage of development. <br><br>  However, the Fermi paradox itself is really very interesting, it is also called the Great Silence paradox.  Indeed, with such huge numbers, the chance of contact must be very large.  But there are a lot of reservations.  For example, it‚Äôs not at all the fact that a civilization that is close enough to us is in contact with us.  Maybe it is still underdeveloped in information technology.  Or the development of this civilization has taken a completely different path, maybe they are interested in other things.  Not all civilizations have necessarily hit IT, like humanity (maybe they are philosophers, hehe), because if you think about it, in the last 50-100 years we have only information technologies reached an incredible speed of development, and other areas have not made any fundamental breakthroughs for a long time .  This is strange - in theory everything should be interconnected and one should push the other forward.  So it happens, of course, but coeff.  correlation is far from unity. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/300/082/fe0/300082fe0f96ed8514b50cd11bcac50b.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>The game SPORE reminds us that the Universe is wise and beautiful.</i>  <i>And be sure to give us surprises.</i> <br><br>  There is still an interesting option that this civilization, let's call it Mymtik, is generally not interesting contact with us.  For various reasons.  They have cool technologies for transmitting information, but they are not interested in contact at all, or they are afraid to do it.  Or maybe they were watching us, but we did not pass the trust test, proving to be a rather quarrelsome and inadequate population, and Mymtik, as already quite developed and befell the zen race, decided to abandon the contact.  And there are no other civilizations nearby, except for the Mytics.  Or eat, but they didn‚Äôt like us either.  Hence the name of the article - maybe we are just unworthy of contact and isolated us from it.  As a special case of such a direction of assumptions - the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A2%25D0%25B5%25D1%2585%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B3%25D1%2583%25D0%25BB%25D1%258F%25D1%2580%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%258C">technological singularity of</a> other civilizations. <br><br>  The next option is that the Mymtiks decided to take a risk and make contact with us, but physically they cannot do it - the technologies are not sufficiently developed to reach us, and we do not accept messages because we don‚Äôt have such technologies or even worse. Our methods of receiving / transmitting information are very different from the methods of transmitting information of the Myths.  We are waiting for a laser or a ship on the head, and they are being thrown by bosons.  And just launching a ‚Äúbottle‚Äù in our direction (read Pioneer-1 \ 2) with a tied message will not work - until both civilizations reach the flippers.  Or the ‚Äúbottle‚Äù has been flying for a long time, even with passengers on board, but it will have to be patient and wait. <br><br>  In general, on the scale of the universe it is very difficult to say something.  After all, all observations are based on the study of electromagnetic waves, but as long as these waves have reached us, evolution can take place there, and 4 world wars, and the death of civilization, in general, a full set of all-inclusive, and we will sit and wait until all these events can notice with such a huge delay.  Messages can go on for tens of thousands of years, and for now there are no grounds for asserting that there are ways to deliver information, and even more so matter, much faster. <br><br>  I still tend to the fact that the Mymtik is somewhere nearby, the time has not come yet.  In addition, there is a very important and slightly amusing factor - if all civilizations are actively searching for signals and sending as little as Earth, then the chance of contact is rather low.  Yes, just an incorrect strategy for receiving / transmitting information.  We hope that we will be noticed simply because we have an increased electromagnetic background (which has dropped since the development of new technologies, such as optical fiber), and there are very few signals from the helmet. <br>  In any case, humanity now has many other tasks.  No, do not kill each other in the third act of world love and slide down to sticks with spears, but to colonize the solar system, for a start.  <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F_%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D1%2581%25D0%25B0">The colonization of Mars</a> and the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A2%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2584%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5_%25D0%2592%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D1%258B">terrorization of Venus</a> are very interesting and exciting things. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/700/a1d/b00/700a1db00cade896387e724bd49f58a7.jpg" alt="Terraformed Venus"><br>  <i>Terraformed Venus</i> <br><br>  In addition, it is clearly necessary to invest all forces not in civil strife and conflict, but by all means trying to invent working methods for moving our carcasses to more significant distances.  And there we will meet life too, I am sure. <br>  The main thing to remember is that if we are not alone, then we will show ourselves as fools, destroying our appearance in constant wars.  And if one thing is all the more, we give every chance for the disappearance of such a rare thing as the carbon form of life. <br>  We must live by science, gentlemen, science and love.
