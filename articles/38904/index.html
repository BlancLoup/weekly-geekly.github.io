      And now let's see what this license shines with us along with other Google services. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Tobish, everything that you managed to do with the help of this browser - quite legitimately falls into the hands of Google.  Including personal, personal information.  Photos, correspondence, messages on the forums.  And Google generally likes to store a bunch of different information.  Previously, he knew only what you were looking for.  Then a google post appeared and he found out about what and with whom you correspond.  Then a google reader appeared and he found out what you were reading.  In our time, it is important not so much to own this information, how to be able to process large amounts of it and to take advantage of it.  I think Google can do it. <br><br>  Two days ago, the third version of the Picas was released - it can now recognize faces.  You yourself sign your photos and from now on Google knows how you and your loved ones look.  Even if you do not do such nonsense, your acquaintance who has your photo and picas will do it.  Theoretically, it is enough to sign one person once so that Google recognizes this person in all the photos stored in the database. <br><br>  Are you still not scared?  If to summarize all the above, it turns out a very detailed personal case for each Internet user who uses Google.  And who among us did not use them?  Do you even provide details about which you can find out if you aim to benefit from it?  Yes, to hell with it, with benefits, just imagine that a person has been using the whole range of Google services for 5 years in a row.  5 years long dossier: all photos are in chronological order, sometimes with even gps coordinates indicated - we know where you were, when and with whom.  Your entire search query history - what you were looking for, what were interested in, when.  Your history of visits to sites - what you read, what information you own, what you bought, where, for how much, what you are interested in.  What they were sick with, where they went, what films they watched, in which cinemas, whether you use drugs, visit opposition sites, and what kind of porn do you prefer.  All your correspondence with whom, about what.  All information about your contacts is collected in the same way as yours - with photos and everything else. <br><br>  If you correctly put together all these data - a person can know better than his own mother knows.  His psychological portrait, sphere of interest.  What then with this data will do?  Well, Google will swear that all this will be used solely for the best of reasons to make our life easier and more convenient, for example, advertising targeting.  Well, who would doubt.  But I am doubted that a person who understands that power is in his hands will resist the temptation to use it.  Well, or not a person, but an organization.  After all, we know that when it comes down to business, all the cries for freedom of speech and protection of personal life are cries and remain. <br><br>  Someone will say - so what?  I have nothing to hide, I am a law-abiding citizen, well, think about it - they know everything about me - and then what?  I‚Äôm a little gray mouse that nobody cares about.  - Indeed, you will be a part of the statistics.  We will not consider cases when all this data falls into the hands of a petty fraudster who once ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù meets you at a bar and understands you so well that he‚Äôs not gone a couple of days as he becomes your best friend to the grave and after a week, disappears with your wife, after receiving your company, home and borrowing money.  Of course, I'm exaggerating, because this can not happen to you, this is not a movie, right?  You will be just invisible in a crowd like you, who, using statistics and personal information, simply brainwash themselves very efficiently and imperceptibly and push the different crap you really need, cutting off coupons from you.  There were no associations with a flock of sheep, no?  Well, well, why do we need excitement, why do we need to know that the entire advertising industry is paid by us <br><br>  But to be a gray mouse may not work.  Every person has his weaknesses.  And if you know how to use them, you can make ropes of you.  And when there are millions of such people? <br><br>  I will not summarize, I am sure that your imagination will help you and draw the appropriate picture of the personal information apocalypse, under the guidance of Google, not worse than me.  Of course, I could be wrong.  I just do paranoid and I tend to see what really is not.  I am almost certainly mistaken.  Only here in the picture that I drew - nothing is impossible, either technically or whatever. <br><br>  As for me, after all these thoughts I carried Chrome.  Now here I think, how would I be so more comfortable to refuse the mail with the reader? <br><br>  About how to confront this - I will tell you next time. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/38904/">https://habr.com/ru/post/38904/</a></p>
