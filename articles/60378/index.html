He unfortunately not Habrayuzer, so I place. <br><br>  <b>"My percentage of effectiveness is too low to share experience in undertakings."</b> <br>  It is not clear how you can judge the taste of food without trying it.  Business is practice, practice and practice again. <br><br>  <b>‚ÄúThis is not a business, this is your job that you are doing well.‚Äù</b> <br>  Can you give an example of free money?  You have to pay for everything.  Even just investing money has to bear the risks (country, market, industry, etc.).  To minimize the risks of their study = plow, compete.  The stagnation of the real estate market is very well broken off lovers of freebies. <br>  Business is making money.  Salaries of top Moscow managers are several times higher than the incomes of small private entrepreneurs.  The result is important, not the method. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

      <b>‚ÄúJust unlike work for a company, here you get a double income, determined by the fact that there are no expenses for UST and organization.‚Äù</b> <br>  That's right.  Moreover, in many areas of services, the cost of work can be ten times higher than the salary (for example, building design).  Working for yourself, you yourself make a profit ... as if you yourself become a top manager with a high pay. <br><br>  <b>"Who has money, they often want to throw him"</b> <br>  In order to make this money yourself you have to strain a lot and evolve the brain.  After such a transformation, the person becomes different.  Most people who win millions in the lottery become poor after a couple of years.  People who have learned how to earn millions suffer a lot of bankruptcies, open new businesses and continue to earn millions.  Experience is important! <br><br>  <b>‚ÄúOf course, there is freedom, but in some cases, the fact that for others the holiday is New Year, March 8, you can‚Äôt technically make money and have a rest with your family == problems in the family‚Äù</b> <br>  Think of the pros.  You yourself organize your working day, decide how much you want to profit and how much you need to work.  The success of work, unlike work for an uncle, is 90% dependent on you.  There are unforeseen work and unforeseen costs, but this is again our joint.  It was necessary to provide.  IMHO, it is much better to know the result of their work than to live in hope. <br>  There is still one moment.  Work will only be productive when it is "high".  Remember famous artists, musicians, athletes.  They work 20 hours a day and enjoy it.  This is the only way to become the best and compete.  Favorite activity, no matter how hard it was, brings pleasure.  Unloved work, regardless of its severity brings only stress.  The severity of the work is determined only by our attitude towards it, and not by the norms and rates. <br><br>  UPD: Author <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/my_business/60286/">Business vs rest</a> .  fixated on the internet.  There are more opportunities in the real economy. <br><br>  PS: For discussions with Autograder, you can send him an invite;).  I think it will be interesting - comrade has experience working for his uncle in different offices, working on the stock exchange and willing to start his own business. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/60378/">https://habr.com/ru/post/60378/</a></p>
