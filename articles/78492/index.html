  <section class="page js-page"><h1>‚ÄúBrazilian training‚Äù</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello, dear! <br>  I want to share with the community my thoughts on a topic raised in recent posts ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/my_business/55116/">Wolf</a> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/my_business/85950/">Daily</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/arbeit/85875/">Butterfly Effect</a> and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/my_business/85950/">Freedom or Fear. Make Your Choice</a> ). <br>  To begin, probably, should be a little from afar. <br>  In 1997 I graduated from the Faculty of Biology of the Far Eastern State University and went to work as a biologist.  I was bored sitting in the laboratory and for nine years I happily ran through the taiga, studying various interesting little animals.  And before that, it was interesting to me that I was not particularly strained at the expense of paying for that work a little, to say the least. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  In 2006, he moved to St. Petersburg, looked for a job in his specialty, not immediately, but found - in 2007, he worked at the Institute of Urban Studies, participated in the creation of the General Plan of Tver and the Development Plan of the Arkhangelsk Region, and since November 2007 got a job as an ecologist on the Russian Antarctic Expedition .  More than a year otzymoov in Antarctica, studied penguins ... Salary was tolerable, although it could be more. <br><br>  And so, during the wintering process, various intelligent thoughts began to come into my head - from the category of ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs next?‚Äù I didn‚Äôt want to go on an expedition anymore, and I didn‚Äôt want to sit on the dismal budget wage of a biologist at the institute even more. <br>  At this moment, with the help of friends, I was struck with the idea that it might be worth changing the field of activity altogether, since in biology everything is so sad with financing.

      I had a couple of DVDs with Linux distributions with me, in which there were both programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãand documentation (there was no free access to the Internet at our station).  And the first part of the Merleson Ballet began - first the databases (they could be built for the real business - for processing field materials collected by me), then the interfaces to these bases. <br><br>  As a result, at the time of wintering, I, being self-taught, created a real database on PostgreSQL and its replica on MySQL, and wrote simple interfaces (data entry, modification, deletion, output with all sorts of conditions) to work with these databases in C, Perl , Python, PHP and Ruby (pure Ruby, I also had no idea about rails). <br><br>  But the same fear, which has already been repeatedly mentioned, repeatedly brought to my inner eye the same line from the published vacancies: ‚ÄúI need a programmer for ... <b>with 3 years</b> experience ...‚Äù I have experience in extreme environmental conditions 10 years, and with programming experience - some kind of garbage ... <br><br>  I returned at the end of May 2009, received holiday pay and immediately began discussions with my relatives and friends, what to do next.  My good friends immediately advised me not to bathe about my lack of work experience, but simply to write a resume, where to indicate, first, 10 years of experience working with databases (this is true, in general, all past years I used MS Access to process field materials), secondly, add a year of Web development experience (did you do the interface to the database in PHP? So write, do not mislead people), and third, without unnecessary modesty, add to key Words often found in the job descriptions magic, apparently, a bunch of HTML + CSS + JQuery + AJAX.  So I did.  And he responded to all the <s>vacancies</s> posted on <s>Headhunter</s> on one famous site. <br><br>  Quite quickly began to receive answers.  They, as a rule, or contained additional questions (‚ÄúAnd do you know how?‚Äù, ‚ÄúAnd how are things with you?‚Äù), Or test tasks.  In any case, a day or two of intense reading of everything that can be reached, and I could confidently answer all the questions that were in the letter. <br><br>  A month later, one office called me for an interview, just seeing my code.  They didn't take me there at the end and the marathon continued.  Jobs-tests-studies-failures-vacancies-tests-studies-Ur!  Interview!  - failures ... <br>  After the fifth interview in a row I was hired.  Although they thought and doubted for a long time, the ability and readiness to learn and do it quickly decided everything. <br>  The entire job search took a little less than 3 months.  Polar vacation lasted until the first salary "butt". <br><br>  The quality of such training can be judged by the following facts: <br>  1) the trial period passed normally; <br>  2) Recently, I once again raised the salary. <br><br>  Honestly, changing my field so cool (from biology to programming) at 34 is not easy.  But really, as you can see. <br><br>  Right now RubyOnRails is on my agenda, since our organization started an interesting project using ROR.  Moving on, reading, writing, learning ... <br><br>  Do not be afraid to change, do not be afraid to become an upstart, do not be afraid of failures of employers (investors, beautiful girls, etc.)  Do it! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/78492/">https://habr.com/ru/post/78492/</a></p>
