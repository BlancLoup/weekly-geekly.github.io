On the one hand, this policy is useless, since the effect of the policy of the prepend is fading away at values ‚Äã‚Äãin the region of 5, on the other hand, such an announcement remains legitimate.

      We asked questions to the users with whom we had blinked sessions, and in most cases the BGP session on the user's side was configured using Quagga or Brocade routers (which is also based on Quagga).  Having assembled a stand, we were convinced that the problem was indeed localized in Quagga implementation - after processing this route, Quagga created an announcement with several anomalies at once: the route turned out to be the wrong length of the <code>AS_PATH</code> attribute, as well as the very value of the <code>AS_PATH</code> attribute turned out to be incorrect. <br><br>  As a result, in accordance with <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4271">RFC4271</a> , a similar announcement led to the rupture of BGP sessions, which began to rupture BGP sessions around the world.  For operators whose upstream providers use Quagga, this anomaly, due to the constant breaks in the BGP session, was able to result in partial or complete network unavailability.  We found several hundred networks affected by this incident. <br><br>  This anomaly was repeated last weekend, but for another prefix - <code>186.176.186.0/23</code> .  It ended only yesterday, October 16, 2017, thus the total duration of the incident was more than two days. <br><br>  At the end of last week‚Äôs implementation of Quagga, as part of release 1.2.2, an error was fixed with the length of the attribute <code>AS_PATH</code> .  Our team also sent an additional patch that fixes the second problem with the contents of this attribute itself.  As of last week, the error in the code was partially corrected in the framework of release <code>1.2.2</code> .  The Qrator Radar team provided an additional patch for Quagga, correcting the formation of the incorrect value of the <code>AS_PATH</code> attribute, and yesterday <a href="http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/quagga.git/commit/%3Fh%3Dbalajig_devel">it was adopted</a> , but is not yet related to the current release. <br><br>  We strongly recommend all Quagga users to upgrade their software to version <code>1.2.2</code> and keep track of subsequent updates.  Also, in the appendix to this publication, we attach a patch that fixes both the above problems with Quagga announcements. <br><br>  Quagga team thanks for your quick response. <br><br>  <a href="https://radar.qrator.net/content/0001-Fix-problems-with-long-as-path.patch">Link</a> to patch. <br>  <a href="https://radar.qrator.net/blog/global-consequence-of-bug-in-quagga-routing-engine">Check</a> if your AS is offended. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/340356/">https://habr.com/ru/post/340356/</a></p>
