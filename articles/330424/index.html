  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Joint security in the cloud according to RUVDS, HUAWEI and Kaspersky Labs</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A year later, the previous event, as promised, RUVDS and HUAWEI gathered everyone again, but already with Kaspersky Lab.  This time they discussed the security of cloud solutions, including a joint one from the event organizers and their partners.  In our opinion, it was interesting and many things were presented for the first time in Russia.  Below is a brief overview of the event for those who missed. <br><br> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/ruvds/blog/330424/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f27/46a/247/f2746a247755516ce494094edfb46805.jpg"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The event was held at the Moscow hotel ARARAT PARK HYATT on May 31 and, like a year ago, gathered about a hundred vendors, consumers and other interested parties.  Of particular interest at the event was the presentation of the thinclient technological solution from RUVDS and HUAWEI.  Specialized equipment and software can significantly reduce the cost of acquiring personal computers in favor of a combined cloud solution.  But first things first. <br><br>  One of the brightest reports of the forum was a presentation by guests from Switzerland: Deltalis data center CEO Frank Harzheim and sales manager Lidia Schreider-Strobe told about their data center in the canton of Uri in Switzerland, which is considered one of the most secure and safe data- centers in the world.  And from January of this year, this data center was also at the disposal of RUVDS clients.

And Switzerland is exactly the place where special attention is paid to it. ‚Äù  After the report, a short video about the data center was presented, which was met with stormy applause: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/H11YHqinl0g" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The speakers of the plenary session were followed by the Joint Security of Cloud Business Solutions, during which the speakers discussed various methods of ensuring security in the cloud, their advantages and disadvantages, and how these solutions are suitable for end users. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3e4/69b/ecd/3e469becd78ceaaa9b90b367a7bfa275.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">In the photo from left to right: Stanislav Pogorzhelsky (HOSTKEY), Alexander Misyurev (Development Director, AIG), Alexander Milyar (HUAWEI), Frank Harzheim (CEO, Deltalis), Lydia Schreider-Stroub (Sales Manager, Deltalis)</font></i> <br><br>  The discussion turned out to be intense and very interesting.  The speakers agreed that absolute protection could not be provided either on a physical server or on a virtual one, and here, by the way, we had a recent decision from AIG and RUVDS to insure against the risks of data loss and confidential information leakage.  RUVDS became the first provider in Russia to insure its customers and liability to them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b71/725/d45/b71725d45539fe92703a0c19942ca2cd.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">In the photo: Alexander Misyurev (Director of Development, AIG), Alexander Milyar (HUAWEI)</font></i> <br><br>  Alexander Misyurev, director of the AIG business development department in Russia, assured that this type of insurance is not new to AIG and until now the main insurers were large corporate clients, financial institutions that are concerned about various threats to their data and services, and small and medium enterprises. online business.  With the RUVDS case, other market participants will catch up, he is sure.  After all, among other things, this is a more mature alternative to SLA agreements common in the market.  But unlike the latter, an insurance policy will allow you to receive compensation commensurate with potential losses, and not with the cost of the service provider. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8b0/d74/1a9/8b0d741a9c63f5042df0d9ace88c159b.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">In the photo from left to right: Vladimir Ostroverkhov (corporate sales support expert, Kaspersky Lab), Mikhail Sergeev (director of corporate communications, GARS telecom), Nikita Tsaplin (managing partner, RUVDS)</font></i> <br><br>  The SMB segment (medium and small business) has generally become the key topic of the session.  The speakers discussed requests from this audience, how important this segment is for vendors.  And it turned out that demand in this segment is actively growing, agreed with Alexander Misiurev (AIG) and vendors of security solutions from Kaspersky Lab, and the Varity project, Vladimir Ostroverkhov and Danila Chezhin.  As for providers, both RUVDS representatives and HOSTKEY provider (Nikita Tsaplin and Stanislav Pogorzhelsky) could not confirm the growth of SMB customers, believing that many register accounts for individuals.  However, one cannot but agree with Vladimir Ostroverhov that the SMB segment has become more competent in technologies of both virtualization and security. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a6a/608/26b/a6a60826bfa0029ff177b9ad5461608e.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">In the photo from left to right: Nikita Tsaplin (Managing Partner, RUVDS), Danila Chezhin (Sales Director, Variti)</font></i> <br><br>  Next, the guests received a report on the topic ‚ÄúProper protection of clouds‚Äù from Kaspersky Lab, in which an integrated approach to the proper protection of cloud infrastructures was considered, not bypassing the technology, some of which were offered by RUVDS to their customers.  In particular, there were demonstrated fundamental differences in security compared with traditional solutions; you can read the report <a href="http://cloudrussia.ru/report2017">here</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5b6/383/dd6/5b6383dd64c8a4ed5b24466c35cef266.jpg"><br><br>  Two reports on HUAWEI VDI technologies, as well as technology trends and current SDN solutions for the data center, completed the events.  The first of which was a logical continuation of the presentation of the joint product RUVDS-HUAWEI for VDI, which is a set of software and hardware solutions for deploying cost-effective VDI solutions on the RUVDS cloud platform. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7fa/8a0/ef5/7fa8a0ef51fe944987ae42583e2e0d45.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">In the photo: a demonstration stand of a joint VDI-solution RUVDS-HUAWEI</font></i> <br><br>  After the completion of the main program, the guests traditionally waited for the rally of HUAWEI smartphones, the entertainment of drinks from RUVDS and informal communication. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3b1/043/a87/3b1043a8734517f8ebceaa528f7f88a2.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">In the photo: Artem Fedoseev (Managing Director, RUVDS)</font></i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7ac/392/fa5/7ac392fa50e3649638c2a2504846a0a1.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">In the photo: Lydia Schreider-Strub (Sales Manager, Deltalis), Franz Harzheim (CEO, Deltalis), Alexey Khoroshilov (General Director, MT TECHNOLOGIES), George Khomasuridze (Leading Customer Support Specialist, Ultravds)</font></i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/010/2d0/633/0102d0633a6f7c3edcdd93616cb774f0.jpg"><br><br>  RUVDS together with HUAWEI hold the Forum annually in order to maintain communication with the end user and exchange experience with the largest vendors of IT services in Russia and abroad.  ‚ÄúMost of our clients find us via the Internet and the experience of such events is invaluable for us and the entire IAAS segment,‚Äù said Nikita Tsaplin, managing partner of RUVDS. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/1ef/262/f84/1ef262f849d64c089f749ede702e7d53.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/fb1/360/da0/fb1360da03d04a35abed410c80594fcc.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/91c/b61/0dc/91cb610dcce44abe81489da784fd7b24.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/cae/ae3/abd/caeae3abd7494f12a375429bcfbae6a2.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/330424/">https://habr.com/ru/post/330424/</a></p>
