His fault is in disobeying the court.  According to American law, he will now be kept in custody for an unlimited time: ‚Äúuntil he fully complies‚Äù with the HDD decryption requirement, as stated in the <a href="http://arstechnica.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/comply.pdf">warrant</a> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The document states that the suspect was confiscated:

    <ul><li>  Apple Mac Pro; </li><li>  cell phone Apple iPhone 6 Plus; </li><li>  external hard drive Western Digital My Book for Mac; </li><li>  external hard drive Western Digital My Book VelociRaptor Duo. </li></ul><br>  The authorities were unable to examine the contents of the two external disks encrypted by FileVault.  The Mac Pro computer was decrypted using the recovery key from the iPhone 5S, but they did not find anything suspicious. <br><br>  Counsel Keith Donoghue demands that his ward be released immediately: ‚ÄúHe was not only detained without charge, he had never been tried in his life,‚Äù he wrote in a <a href="http://arstechnica.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/philydecrypt.pdf">petition</a> for the Court of Appeals for the Third District of the United States. <br><br>  The authorities are seeking from the suspect decrypt HDD <a href="http://arstechnica.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/decryptruling.pdf">on the basis of the law All Writs Act</a> .  Adopted in 1789, the law is valid now, as amended in 1911, as amended, but in principle it has not changed in 227 years.  By law, the court ‚Äúhas the right to issue all the necessary orders in its jurisdiction that comply with the principles of law‚Äù if other legal instruments are not applicable.  This is the same law that the Department of Justice <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/271892/">tried to apply to Apple</a> , demanding that the San Bernardino offender's iPhone be deciphered, which Apple <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/271238/">refused to do</a> .  The authorities refused the trial, according to them, had to pay "third-party hackers" <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/274739/">more than $ 1 million for hacking</a> . <br><br>  The lawyer believes that in this case the Fifth Amendment to the US Constitution is violated.  It states, in particular, that a person accused of committing a crime should not be compelled to testify against himself. <br><br>  Keith Donohue recalls that in a similar case in 2000, the court decided that the suspect could not be forced to issue a safe code in which evidence could be stored against him.  On the other hand, in 2012, a federal appeals court <a href="http://www.wired.com/2012/02/laptop-decryption-appeal-rejected/">ruled</a> that the accused of bank fraud had to decipher the contents of his laptop, although that decision was not enforced because the experts were able to independently decipher the laptop. <br><br>  The Foundation for Electronic Fronts stood up for the suspect in possession of the CP, which published its own statement for the Court of Appeal of the Third District of the United States with an analysis of judicial precedents from 1886 to 2015. <br><br>  ‚ÄúAt its core, coercion to decipher forces the suspect to use the contents of his mind to translate incomprehensible evidence into a form that can be used against him,‚Äù explain the lawyers of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, pointing to a clear violation of the Fifth Amendment. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/393495/">https://habr.com/ru/post/393495/</a></p>
