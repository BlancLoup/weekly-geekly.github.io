  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Good morning</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The high-frequency squeak resonated with Misha in a terrible way, the sound waves seemed to enter the brain for the purpose of its total destruction.  Finally, the biocontrol system recorded the normalization of brain waves and stopped the sonic torture.  The marketing team approached the advertising campaign of biorhythmic correction on a large scale, and this correction did indeed give a positive result, but right now Michael mentally covered with notable mathews of marketers, and indeed all of the SocialBioKorr employees - it was not the best idea to refuse to extend the license to listen to alarm melodies in favor of the correction of biorhythms. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The smell of chicory that reached the room transferred the hero's wrath to a different direction.  The new object of anger for Mikhail Nikolayevich was the life support system, which for the second week cooked exclusively chicory with salad for breakfast, while natural coffee wanted to be creepy.  Despite the fact that thanks to his personal productive contributions, Misha could afford natural coffee, and the installations were set appropriate, the system considered the coffee harmful for his health. <br>  ‚ÄúCoffee, then, is harmful, and morning squeak is not ...‚Äù - rushed through Misha‚Äôs head. <br><br>  The life support system worked like a clock, notifying him that life satisfaction was lowered, providing the notification with a long list of possible approaches to solving problems.  In any case, it is necessary to undertake something - a reduced level of life satisfaction does not contribute to its productivity, which negatively affects the amount of contributions it makes.  After thinking about it, Mikhail decided to spend a part of his savings, which he retained for the right to visit the food production center of hand-made production, for a half-hour subscription to the audio information channel ‚ÄúClassics of Socialist Rock‚Äù.  Room audio speakers filled the apartment with the sound of guitars mixed with the vocals of a certain Sergei Zverev. <br><br>  Misha once read that in the past, people spent time and productive contributions in order to look at live playing artists, and this phenomenon caused him genuine interest.  He resolutely did not understand the meaning of such events, in the end, really, they did not have opportunities for audio synthesis?

      ‚ÄúTo hell, people consider me crazy even when they find out that I prefer‚Äû Classics of socialist rock ‚Äúto generated ideal harmonic music ...‚Äù - he tried to get rid of Misha‚Äôs strange thoughts. <br><br>  Suddenly, the music stopped playing, a system notification of extreme importance arose before Mikhail's eyes.  The title of the notice read: ‚ÄúYou received a state genetic order.‚Äù  With shaking hands with excitement, he reproduced the gestures necessary for reading the notice and read its contents: <br>  ‚ÄúState Genetic Order No. 18.2114.10577594. <br>  Dear Mikhail Nikolaevich, a resident of the Unified European Socialist Republic, the serial number is 1827176630045. With this message we notify you that as part of the strategic planning of the human resource for the next fifty years, you have been selected as a genetic donor to replenish the Children's Educational Center IT-1051865.  We are obliged to come to the City Genetic Center today at 4:00 pm. ‚Äù </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/186992/">https://habr.com/ru/post/186992/</a></p>
