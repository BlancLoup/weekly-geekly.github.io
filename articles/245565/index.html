Our idea was embodied in the <s>stone</s> online service. <br>  Having made a long way from the idea to the service, through the mountain of code, the walls of tickets and the sea of ‚Äã‚Äãtests, one can say with confidence - we started. <br><br>  Our service puts software in the cloud.  Mostly large server products, but there is also room for small programmer environments.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  What is Deploy4Me? </h2><br>  <b>Deploy4Me</b> is a service for installing business software in the cloud without coding, reading manuals, using tambourines and other shaman devices.  According to the principle of Next, Next, Next. <br><br>  How did the service idea come about?  When the phrase <b>‚ÄúNow we will quickly install and ...‚Äù</b> was heard again, and a long experience in IT suggested that ‚Äúnow‚Äù is an indefinite concept, and sometimes tending to infinity.  Here we thought, why not make the installation service so that, in the foreseeable time and without blunders, put the software in the cloud.  This is how the idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãDeploy4Me was born. <br><br>  Of course, I had to sweat, the project dates were shifted a couple of times, at one time they even succumbed to thoughts about finding investments and tried to find them.  But still - succeeded.  Implemented everything they wanted.  Without investment and in a reasonable time. <br><br><h2>  How does the service work? </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/22a/a65/e02/22aa65e0247d48e5ba3f2b39e97d70ff.png"><br><br>  Deploy4Me works with the Amazon cloud (currently only with it).  The main feature was access to the user's own cloud.  It is in the cloud of the user that we install the software.  So, this is <b>not a hosting</b> that resells the power of Amazon.  The advantage is that you have <b>full control over your virtual machines</b> .  Wanted - removed the connection to Deploy4Me, and all - you're in the house.  Added connection - and again you can continue the installation. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/hqiKfu4ux_4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhbU3tTlrOQ-0Z_3r5K9tZBIv1YCw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The number of cloud connections is unlimited.  This is convenient if you need to install something in the customer's cloud. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f35/566/7fd/f355667fdf094df6a91a961201e88e6f.png"><br><br>  A large amount of time and effort was spent on implementing the interface of working with software.  I wanted to make it as clear and convenient as possible.  So there was a copy, merge, split, add and delete servers in the interface.  Each function was thought out and tried.  For example, the combination takes into account compatibility with the operating system and the possibility of sharing ports. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f9f/f8a/c17/f9ff8ac17d0f4ce3aff32a517d41649c.png"><br><br><h2>  How did the service unroll itself? </h2><br>  When we were preparing for release, it was time to <b>deploy the combat infrastructure</b> , wiki, ticket system and blog.  Everything is good, but, having tried to use our own service for this, we came across various restrictions.  We are IThniki ... and the infrastructure is such a thing.  I wanted to put a separate database.  We want it all.  Really we did a service, and we can‚Äôt install our servers through it.  This is ridiculous.  As they say, if you do not use your product yourself, others will not use it either. <br><br>  After long debates whether to add functions now or postpone, emotions prevailed and for another 2 months we sat down for coding and testing.  So the ability to separate the database from the frontend has been implemented! <br>  As an example of WordPress with a separate database: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4be/0e2/fc5/4be0e2fc5a844e15bcb74a04ec0c0d50.png"><br><br>  Our happiness did not know the end, until the thought crept in.  The problem is this: there are 2 farms, each farm has a front and a database.  And why ... not to combine the bases on one server and also on one port =) It is said - done. <br>  This is how the database Jira and Confluence look like: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4e6/5c4/0a7/4e65c40a73a841599c77fe3105438040.png"><br><br><h2>  What's next? </h2><br>  Plans for the development of many.  We will continue to communicate with customers.  Develop partnerships with software manufacturers that can be installed through our service.  Improve and add tasty.  There are a couple of unrealized aces in the sleeve =) <br>  Write reviews and suggestions, use <a href="https://deploy4me.com/">Deploy4Me</a> . <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Thanks for reading</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Free credits are given at registration. </div></div></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/245565/">https://habr.com/ru/post/245565/</a></p>
