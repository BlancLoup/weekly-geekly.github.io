  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Music sales make up only 6% of the musician's income.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It is well known that most of the income of record labels is made up of music sales, but when considering individual performers, a completely different picture emerges.  This was shown by the research of Professor Peter Di Cola, who processed the data of several thousand performers and came to the conclusion that, on average, in the income of the author of the sale of music is only six percent, and copyright law affects mainly large performers. <br><br>  It is worth remembering that the Recording Companies Association of America <a href="http://www.riaa.com/physicalpiracy.php%3Fcontent_selector%3Dpiracy-online-scope-of-the-problem">considers</a> piracy its main threat and source of damage for themselves and the authors themselves.  This fact is now being established by them as an immutable truth. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e6d/4f1/6a1/e6d4f16a138130ce89f8b7de74b2a1af.jpg" title="Sources of income"></a>

      However, Professor Peter Di Cola, who works at the School of Law at Northwestern University, was not so sure of this, and conducted an in- <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm%3Fabstract_id%3D2199058">depth study of</a> this issue.  He interviewed 5,000 music performers living in the United States, asking them various questions, including attitudes towards the illegal distribution of sound recordings. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Of all the performers, about a quarter said they suffer from network file sharing, another quarter believe that file sharing actually helps them.  The remaining half does not have an established opinion, or they did not answer this question. <br><br>  The survey showed that if illegal distribution in the network and causes a decline in sales of their records, this decline is insignificant and affects only a small part of their total income.  The pie chart above shows the distribution of sources of income for musicians and their average values ‚Äã‚Äãin total income.  The chart shows that only 6 percent of the income of the average music performer is provided by sales of recorded music.  Revenues, for example, from performances with a live sound are several times higher - this is already 28 percent, and they are growing rapidly, as shown by previous studies. <br><br>  Incomes of large record companies, represented in such a diagram, would look different, since their main source of income is sales of records, which explains the strong position regarding the distribution of music. <br><br>  The study addressed the topic of income of musicians, which allowed to compare income streams depending on the level of earnings.  As can be seen in the figure below, music sales make up less than 10% for any of the income groups, the highest figures for this source are for the least earning musicians - 9%.  The upper group earns an average of 330 thousand dollars a year, and basically this income is provided by composing music and lyrics (28%).  Most performers who are not spoiled by musical income receive profits mainly from live performances (40%). <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d0b/cd2/754/d0bcd27549f222be4556635ac8220c56.jpg" title="Distribution of income sources"></a> <br><br>  Professor Peter Di Cola came to several conclusions, one of which is a reformist view of the structure of the legal base of copyright.  The researcher believes that the laws are created mainly for highly paid performers instead of encouraging all musicians to create new works.  This is not surprising in the light of the existence of entertainment services markets, in which the dominant player receives almost the entire income according to the ‚Äúwinner gets everything‚Äù principle. <br><br>  However, the study does not suggest that copyright law should be ignored or abolished altogether.  One of the reasons for this is that the incomes of some subgroups (for example, composers) are not described by the data obtained - they receive most of the income from writing music.  Di Cola writes that composers and some performers are more vulnerable to copyright infringement <br><br>  It is not clear how much the music industry changes every year, but it will be interesting to see how the figures obtained will change in the future. <br>  <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/music-sales-are-just-6-of-average-musicians-income-130114/">via</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/165849/">https://habr.com/ru/post/165849/</a></p>
