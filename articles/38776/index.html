  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Learning the language by mini immersion</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I think that many people here are interested in learning foreign languages, at least because it won't go far without IT.  For learning languages, many applications have already been created, websites, tests, etc., I think it‚Äôs not worth enumerating, we have tried many of them at least once.  But there is one drawback, the most important one: it is necessary to collect your thoughts, take time, sit down, switch to it and purposefully study.  This is of course correct, but just as if you went to this country along the way, it does not work. <br>  So, I see a solution to this small problem. <a name="habracut"></a>  : we need a service that would force our convolutions about the new language, while not distracting from the main process, i.e.  work, etc. How do I imagine this?  You register on this service, specify your ICQ / Jabber and a specially trained robot will from time to time ask you a question about the messenger on the language.  This can be either a translation of a word from one language to another, or more complex testing, with the insertion of the right word, the choice of the correct turnover, etc., etc. In general, all that we are given when studying in courses and in high school is only more possibilities.  You will not need to go to the service itself, you just need to answer questions from this specially trained bot. <br>  It's simple.  The message came ‚Äútranslation of the word apple‚Äù - answered as ‚Äúapple‚Äù.  The message of course depends on the level of training.  And they didn‚Äôt answer it as it usually happens on regular services, when your table is overwhelmed with all sorts of reference books, language textbooks, when you are ready for this and immediately found in the reference book.  And then when you are not ready, and you really have to wriggle with your brains, rummaging in your head in search of the right answer.  Yes, it is more difficult, even tough, but it works, maybe not as a complete immersion in the language environment, but closer to it. <br>  From the use and possibilities I think it is clear, now about the inner side of the matter.  Technically, there are no special difficulties, the library for use, at least Jabber, I know.  For other IM, too, should be, so everything is solved.  A bot needs to be taught to check with whom to ask a question (so that he does not sleep, is not busy, etc.), what question (breaking up into groups, levels and determining what is best to ask, there are techniques), accept the answer ... and that's it.  To all this, to fasten the site, it is enough on the finished CMS, where the user will indicate what he studies and when.  Immediately show him the statistics on the study, that he is good at what is bad, ratings, etc. Let the statistics and the level of education even publish, show how he is cool in the language, what is not social.  Is the network working? <br>  Yes, and more.  We are business people, we understand that to launch such a combine is also expensive, which means that service and development should at least pay off.  Here, too, there are options: you can take orders for any research (conduct a survey), advertise on the site (if of course there will be the mentioned social element) and offer paid courses and paid certificates (and more accurately reflect the reality than the same brainbench).  By the way, not necessarily language training, you can teach / test on a variety of topics, but this is all a further development, and there is much to develop. <br>  So, if this is already somewhere, even though I have not found it, then great, I will use it.  If not, damn it, let's do it ourselves !? <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> I was told here that there is unreliable software, with similar functionality.  Plus here is that you do not need an Internet, the downside is that not everyone will put it at work.  Although I heard that messengers in some places are also prohibited.  In general, here everyone chooses what is more convenient. <br>  And I would also like to note that this is by no means a replacement for traditional education.  This is just a way to keep yourself in good shape, during pauses between learning from books, courses, sites, etc. <br></div>
