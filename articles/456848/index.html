    <h2>  Windows 3.1 </h2><br>  Music <a href="https://tpenguinltg.wordpress.com/2013/10/23/microsofts-sample-midi-files/">appeared</a> in Windows 3.1, introduced in the 90s.  Around this time, the first MIDI-enabled sound cards came onto the market.  Also began to appear software to work with this format - for example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steinberg_Cubase">Steinberg Cubase</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finale_(software)">Finale</a> . <br><br><blockquote>  Windows 3.1 included nine MIDI songs that were in the C: \ WINDOWS \ MEDIA folder.  You can listen to them all <a href="">on Archive.org</a> . </blockquote><br>  Two tracks are excerpts of classical works by Bach and Vivaldi - " <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2591%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B1%25D1%2583%25D1%2580%25D0%25B3%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D1%2586%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D1%2582%25D1%258B">Brandenburg Concerts</a> " and "The <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2592%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B0_(%25D0%2592%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8)">Seasons</a> ".  Two more works demonstrated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passport_Designs">Passport Designs</a> MIDI sequencer capabilities - PASSPORT.MID and CANYON.MID. <br><br>  The author of the first is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/ncigy/whos_the_composer_of_passportmid/">unknown for sure</a> , but the second <a href="http://vgmpf.com/Wiki/index.php%3Ftitle%3DTrip_Through_the_Grand_Canyon">was made by the</a> jazz musician George Stone as the composer.  But he did not anticipate that the music will be distributed along with Windows (he wrote it to advertise a sequencer on the MAC).  Passport Designs experienced financial difficulties and sold the rights to the Microsoft composition without the knowledge of Stone.  George did not receive money from this transaction, but his work has gained wide acceptance. <br><br>  There are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results%3Fsearch_query%3DCanyon.mid%2Bcover">lots of</a> CANYON.MID <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results%3Fsearch_query%3DCanyon.mid%2Bcover">covers on</a> YouTube.  The composition was even performed at one of the MAGFest festivals devoted to computer games and music in them. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8eRgGS4SuJ8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><h2>  Windows 95 </h2><br>  Here <a href="">CLOUDS.MID was</a> added to the previous nine tracks.  It was conceived as ‚ÄúEaster eggs‚Äù, therefore it was not in the MEDIA directory.  To listen to the song, it was necessary to perform a number of manipulations with folders.  Instructions <a href="http://www.brianorr.com/blog/2010/01/14/windows-95-easter-egg-song-clouds-mid/">are</a> in the blog of the composer CLOUDS - Brian Orr (Brian Orr), who at that time was an intern at Microsoft. <br><br>  In addition to the new MIDI song, two music videos <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/rmanmb/woah-weezers-buddy-holly-was-included-on-the-windows-95-install-cd">appeared</a> in Windows 95.  The event was timed to release the free version of the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_for_Windows">Video For Windows</a> player that comes with the operating system.  The first video is the clip of the American singer Edie Brickell for the song <a href="http:/www.blinn.com/wtvn/980419.htm">"Good Times"</a> . <br><br>  The second is the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DkemivUKb4f4">video</a> for the song ‚ÄúBuddy Holly‚Äù from the Weezer album.  Stylized as a scene from the sitcom " <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D1%2587%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B2%25D1%258B%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8_(%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB)">Happy Days</a> " clip won <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddy_Holly_(song)">four</a> MTV <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddy_Holly_(song)">awards</a> , including the title of "Best Alternative Clip."  Today the song Buddy Holly is considered one of the most recognizable compositions of the 90s, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D10rGK92gblc">covers</a> are still being <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D10rGK92gblc">performed</a> on it. <br><br><h2>  Windows 98 </h2><br>  In Windows 98, all MIDI tracks were replaced with three new files.  As representatives of Microsoft <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20130212-00/%3Fp%3D5263">told</a> , few musical instruments were involved in them. <br><br><blockquote>  These three tunes were often <a href="https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/off-topic/computer-science-and-technology/490303-the-meaning-behind-onestop-mid-town-mid-and">used</a> by Microsoft technical support specialists as tools for diagnosing problems with multimedia extensions.  With their help checked the performance of sound drivers. </blockquote><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cC9Wr3OpaK0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  New tunes were called FLOURISH.MID, TOWN.MID and ONESTOP.MID.  The authorship of the first two tracks is attributed to <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2122794/">Neuton Grieg</a> (Nathan Grigg), today known for his soundtracks for the FEAR and Middle-Earth series of games.  The third song was written by David Yackley (David Yackley), and the glory of one of the worst music MIDI-files of Microsoft was <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/%3Fp%3D5263">fixed</a> to it. <br><br><h2>  Windows ME and XP </h2><br>  In the IT community, Windows ME <a href="https://www.neowin.net/forum/topic/377659-why-is-windows-me-unstable/">does not have the best</a> reputation, but this OS is known for the track ‚Äú <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DwQS9_ei66Co">Beautiful Way</a> ‚Äù from the American multi-instrumentalist <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2591%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA_%25D0%25A5%25D1%258D%25D0%25BD%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD">Beck Hansen</a> .  The composition was part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midnite_Vultures">Midnite Vultures</a> album, which was highly appreciated both by critics and fans of the musician. <br><br>  The new track demonstrated the capabilities of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Systems_Format">ASF</a> multimedia format containing streaming audio and video.  Typically, these files had the extension .asf, but if the container contained only music, it was designated as .wma.  It was in this format that compositions were presented in Windows XP. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wl/4d/hm/wl4dhmfjg7jmi1f__3wljchmqz8.jpeg"><br>  <sup><font color="#A9A9A9"><i>Photo by <a href="">Simon Goldin</a> CC BY-SA / Windows XP's ‚ÄúSerenity‚Äù photo taken in 2006</i></font></sup> <br>  Windows XP came out just a year after Windows ME and became the first operating system in which the well-known Sample Music directory appeared.  It contained songs from the last album of the rock group <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talking_Heads">Talking Heads</a> , as well as the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D1%2586%25D0%25BE">scherzo</a> from the Ninth Symphony of Beethoven and a light jazz number called ‚Äú <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DKuyogMrZqd4">Highway Blues</a> ‚Äù by Mark Sils. <br><br><h2>  Windows vista </h2><br>  In Windows Vista, the number of music tracks that came with the system reached eleven.  Among them were the works of Italian percussion duet <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aisha_Duo">Aisha Duo</a> .  The selection includes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DNlHk-PySwwM">two</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DUvsXXiuyMFY">songs</a> from their album Quiet Songs.  Also in the folder with the samples lay the music of the Brazilian jazz singer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luciana_Souza">Luciana Souza</a> ‚Äú <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DeaU_LZeC9Og">Mutia Bobiera</a> ‚Äù and the composition ‚Äú <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DMOSTsRE5IMQ">MAO's Blues</a> ‚Äù by the New York pianist Aaron Goldberg. <br><br>  Senegalese guitarist Habib Koite provided two songs from his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muso_Ko">debut album</a> , in which he combined western guitar music and traditional music of the Mali peoples.  Also in Vista, one could come across works by American percussionist Kursha Kal, who is considered to be the pioneer of the dance genre <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_Underground">Asian Underground</a> .  Now you can <a href="https://karshkalemusic.bandcamp.com/album/realize">listen to</a> his songs <a href="https://karshkalemusic.bandcamp.com/album/realize">on Bandcamp</a> . <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s6R2Ko5qRkA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Diluted ethnic music and jazz songs The Posies.  The band just released their first album in eight years.
