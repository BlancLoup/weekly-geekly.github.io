  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Wean Chrome to eat hard drives</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I like Chrome, but it bothered me that it squeaks with the hard drive as if they do not break.  I decided to wean him to do it.  It turned out, now sharing the recipe. <br><br>  What for?  First, the hard drive - not iron, in the sense - iron, of course, but knows how to break and the more they hammer it - the faster it breaks (as I understood from my own experience when I lost all the data);  secondly, Chrome stores a lot of all sorts of junk in databases that barely use the computer‚Äôs memory, as a result, after a month of use even the address set becomes torture - the hard drive squeaks, the letters are typed in seconds.  All these problems are removed. <br><br>  Warning-warning!  Immediately warn you - a topic for advanced users, a lot of pitfalls!  But if you are worried about your data and the hard drive - welcome to our ranks. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, the idea is simple.  Make RAMDisk (virtual "disk" in the computer's memory) and make Chrome keep there his affairs.  It sounds simple, there are enough pitfalls and some inconvenience will be, but then the hard drive will be released alive and Chrome will fly.  So do not rush to do, read.

      1. Downloading the RAM Disk: the link was taken <a href="http://www.mydigitallife.info/2007/05/27/free-ramdisk-for-windows-vista-xp-2000-and-2003-server/">here (+ explanations)</a> and it led to the <a href="http://depositfiles.com/ru/files/916161">download</a> (in my opinion, even <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/257405">this is</a> the same thing). <br><br>  Download, run, there, in general, everything is obvious.  I created a 128MB RamDisk (less recommend) called R :. <br><br>  In theory, it will automatically be recreated at boot time.  (I'm creating) <br><br>  2. Download Iron Portable (this is a modified Chrome that doesn‚Äôt send Google too much about you - do you want to be paranoid? Try adding 127.0.0.1 google.com to hosts - Google Chrome will not even be able to work - it needs Google‚Äôs dad. At least So it was a couple of months ago.) Link to <a href="">download</a> .  If out of date - look for the Portable version on <a href="http://www.srware.net/en/software_srware_iron_download.php">this page</a> . <br><br>  Why choose Portable?  We want Chrome to store all databases on the RAMDisk (that is, in memory, which is 100 times faster than the hard drive and not so sensitive to overwriting - in other words: it won't break). <br>  But Google Chrome stores all your data in the mystical Application Data / .... directory, and not where you installed it.  In theory, you can run Chrome with a parameter that should change this directory to another, but in practice this key is purely meditative (to calm), but does not really change anything.  So, it was not possible to force the unmodified version of Chrome to store the databases on RAMDisk.  Portable version on the other hand stores data exactly where it is installed.  The rest is almost no different. <br><br>  3. Unpack the Portable version in R: \, rename the folder name to Iron.  Validation: the file R: \ Iron \ IronPortable.exe must exist <br><br>  4. Copy this directory somewhere to your hard drive (backup, because RAMDrive will clear after reboot). <br><br>  5. Create a shortcut for the Portable version, specify: <br>  Object: R: \ Iron \ IronPortable.exe <br>  Working folder: R: \ Iron \ <br><br>  The working folder must be specified!  Otherwise, you will have a profile created where you created a shortcut (on the desktop, for example). <br><br>  6. Disable phishing protection nafig - these are giant files that slow down the work.  If paranoia really hurts - put <a href="http://opendns.com/">OpenDNSs</a> as DNS servers - and it will work faster and will dislike phishers.  If you register and disable advertising for your ip on non-existent sites, it works fine and does not ask for food. <br><br>  7. (optional, problems!) By running this label we get almost silent Chrome.  There remains one more problem - Chrome has a habit of creating etilqs files (sqlite backwards) in the TMP folder (c: \ Windows \ Temp) - this also creates a load.  Go to change the Temp folder on the same RamDrive.  ("Windows Key + Break" - "System Properties" - "Advanced" - "Environment Variables" - in the bottom window we search for TMP, put R: \ tmp <br><br><h4>  Problems </h4><br>  1. The problem of clause 7 is that many programs, for example, WinRAR or installers will unpack temporary files in R: \ TMP and if this file has more than free space (which is about 70MB with Iron Portable installed) then the installation will not reach the end , and the archive will not be unpacked. <br><br>  2. Another problem arises with the fact that sometimes Chrome will suddenly take off from you - this means that the place on R: \ has ended.  We close Chrome, go to r: \ Iron \ Profile \ Default \ Cache \, delete everything there without regrets. <br><br>  3. Another nuance [*]: YouTube and other videos Chrome has a desire to cache, so large videos that do not fit on the RAMDisk will be shown only in chunks.  It may be true, this is solved if you do not do clause 7 (did not check). <br><br>  [*] Dear Habravchane, do not write, please, more " <a href="http://gramota.ru/slovari/dic/%3Fword%3D%25ED%25FC%25FE%25E0%25ED%25F1%26all%3Dx">nuance</a> " - I'm not literate, of course, but it really hurts my eyes and <a href="http://www.google.ru/search%3Fhl%3Dru%26newwindow%3D1%26q%3D%252B%25D0%25BD%25D1%258C%25D1%258E%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D1%2581%2Bsite:habrahabr.ru%26btnG%3D%25D0%259F%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%26lr%3D%26aq%3Df%26oq%3D">often occurs</a> .  (Sometimes you want the tag [spoiler] [/ spoiler]) <br><br>  4. Lastly, if you click ‚ÄúSet Iron as default browser‚Äù desktop shortcuts with links like http: // ... will create profiles where this shortcut is opened, so you need to look in the registry (regedit.exe) http: / handler / (I found several of them, in my opinion HKEY_CURRENT_USER \ Software \ Classes \ http \ shell \ open \ command) - replace there Iron.exe with <i>‚Äúc: \ ram_iron.bat‚Äù - ‚Äú% 1‚Äù</i> and create c: \ ram_iron .bat with this content: <br><br> <code>r: <br> cd \iron\ <br> IronPortable.exe %1 %2 %3 %4</code> <br> <br>  5. Some .html files, for example, from folders with spaces in the name will not open (my bug, but I don‚Äôt know how to fix it using the .bat file without using any programming language).  The point is that in each argument spaces must be replaced by% 20, and how to do it in .bat - who knows. <br><br><h4>  Is it worth it? </h4><br>  For me, yes.  To me, the health of the hard drive and the speed of browsing are very important. <br><br>  Personally, I use Chrome (more precisely, Iron) only in this way, otherwise the ideology of SQLite (‚Äúwe will never lose data, so we write every byte to the hard drive, we don‚Äôt need gigabytes of RAM, we want reliability‚Äù) no matter how correct ( in theory), but hard on the hard drive beats.  There are inconveniences, but they are miserable (to save the state before rebooting, to restore when turned on - of course - not for the novice user), but periodically the cache has to be cleaned (but this can be avoided by taking up more RAMDisk memory). <br><br><img src="http://habrahabr.ru/media/userpic/avatar/14/45/58/31055.png"><br>  Yoi Haji <br>  <a href="http://yoihj.habrahabr.ru/blog/">view from Habra</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/61616/">https://habr.com/ru/post/61616/</a></p>
