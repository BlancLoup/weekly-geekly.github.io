  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The operational headquarters of the Russian Post stops a post collapse</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On the official website of the Russian Post a <a href="http://www.russianpost.ru/rp/press/ru/home/newscompany/item%3Fnewsid%3D7750">message</a> appeared with the following title.  Quote from the site (with correction of errors): <blockquote>  On Saturday, April 13, a meeting of the operational headquarters of the Federal State Unitary Enterprise ‚ÄúPost of Russia‚Äù, created for the early elimination of the collapse of international shipments at the airports of the Moscow hub, was held in emergency mode.  The meeting was held in the main center of the main mail traffic in Moscow. <br><br>  It was led by Alexander Timofeev, who had just returned from the meeting of the Universal Postal Union, the head of the directorate for the organization of production processes at the Russian Post.  He reported that there he was able to reach agreements with the world's leading postal operators about a more rational mode of entry into our country, with the redistribution of their mail to other Russian cities and reducing the burden on the postal service, airports and customs of the capital. </blockquote><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The situation on 04/13/2013: <br><br>  1. Sheremetyevo exported 90 tons of international mail to other processing points.  there is a slight decrease in the arrival mail - by 23 tons.

        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

          data-ad-layout="in-article"

          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

        </script>
      <br>
      2. From Domodedovo sent for processing to Moscow and Samara 100 tons of mail.  83 tons are in operation, the daily residue is 14 tons. <br><br>  To enhance the dispatch and removal of processed mail, transport of the Federal Postal Service Administration from Samara and Novosibirsk was attracted, the personnel was increased by a third. <br><br>  3. Negotiations were held with the countries of the Universal Postal Union to change the logistics of entry into the country. <br><br>  In order to reduce the burden on Moscow airports, where 90% of the entire international Russian Post now arrives, an agreement has finally been reached in negotiations that have been going on for 3 years.  Now mail flows will be redirected from Southeast Asia to Novosibirsk.  Scandinavian countries agreed to use flights to Pulkovo instead of Sheremetyevo. <br><br>  America, England, Israel and Italy sent their mail through flights arriving at Vnukovo airport. <br><br>  And, finally, I will cite another interesting quote from the message: <br><blockquote>  Two years ago, the Post of Russia warned that a collapse would occur due to international e-commerce and prepared for it by opening and at its own expense equipping technically several new terminals, including equipment for customs.  however, the customs service did not take the warnings seriously and did not resolve its personnel issue.  Relevant documents and letters confirming this are attached.  and so far this issue has not been resolved.  the areas are idle while the country is waiting for its parcels, and MMPO Moscow is suffocating in colossal amounts, working at the limit of the technical resources of the building. </blockquote>  The confrontation in the field of shifting responsibility to each other continues.  But we see that the Russian Post is already taking real measures to get out of this situation.  I hope these are not just words and they will be able to unload all of their MMPOs as soon as possible and, in the future, evenly distribute the load between them. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/176609/">https://habr.com/ru/post/176609/</a></p>
