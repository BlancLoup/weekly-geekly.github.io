In release: the modx-club site closed, progress with the conversion of processors, active work on documentation, notes and updates to add-ons. </p><br><p>  Enjoy reading! </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2 id="novosti-i-sobytiya">  News and Events </h2><br><p>  <strong>MODX Club all</strong> </p><br><p>  <a href="https://prisma-cms.com/topics/vse,-net-bolshe-vashego-modx-kluba.html">‚ÄúEverything, there is no more of your MODX-Club‚Äù</a> , Nikolai Lanets wrote the other day and announced the closure of the site modxclub.ru, while the old notes will still be available on the new site of Nikolai‚Äôs project - <a href="https://prisma-cms.com/">prisma-cms.com</a> . </p><br><h2 id="razrabotka-modx">  MODX Development </h2><br><p>  <strong>Documentation</strong> </p><br><p>  Ivan Bochkarev wrote a short note on the current status of MODX documentation - <a href="https://modx.pro/news/18087">‚ÄúMODX Docs.</a>  <a href="https://modx.pro/news/18087">New site.</a>  <a href="https://modx.pro/news/18087">Translation into Russian ‚Äù</a> .  And I must say, the activity with which the work on the documentation of the last weeks is being conducted is simply amazing.  You can see <a href="https://github.com/modxorg/Docs/pulse/monthly">this for</a> yourself - <a href="https://github.com/modxorg/Docs/pulse/monthly">here are the statistics for the month</a> .  <strong>129</strong> commits, <strong>1501</strong> files and <strong>57995</strong> lines added and <strong>14470</strong> lines removed!  Powerfully! </p><br><p>  You can see how the <a href="https://docs.modx.org/">site with the documentation</a> looks, it is regularly updated.  And you can join <a href="https://github.com/modxorg/Docs">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/modxorg/DocsApp">here</a> .  Or ask Ivan Bochkarev, he will tell you where to start. </p><br><p>  <strong>Refactoring</strong> </p><br><p>  Work on refactoring the MODX 3 kernel continues, but not as fast as we would like.  The reason is exactly three people involved: I (Ivan Klimchuk), Joshua L√ºckers and directly Jason Coward, so before you criticize, first consider how you can help. </p><br><p>  Since work is being done on one large <a href="https://github.com/modxcms/revolution/pull/14534">pull request</a> , the changes have to be sent to <a href="https://github.com/opengeek/revolution/pulse">Jason's fork</a> , because of this, in the main repository, all activity is not visible.  However, the result can be seen here - <a href="https://github.com/opengeek/revolution/pulls%3Fq%3Dis%253Apr%2Bis%253Aclosed">here already closed (converted processors) requests</a> . </p><br><p>  <strong>News from GitHub</strong> </p><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://github.com/modxcms/revolution/pull/14558"># 14558</a> - Sergey Shlokov discovered that in the MODX database schema there is one interesting index that is essentially useless, and in some cases even harmful, and suggested removing it.  Removing something is always perceived with caution, so the discussion on the appropriateness of this action continues on github.  However, the evidence is very obvious and the garbage should definitely be removed from the system. </li><li>  <a href="https://github.com/modxcms/revolution/pull/14559"># 14559</a> - Ilya Utkin discovered a regression of changes, which is expressed in the missing animation of checkboxes on the resource page and corrected this misunderstanding. </li></ul><br><h2 id="interesnye-zametki-i-stati">  Interesting notes and articles </h2><br><ul><li>  Mat Dave Jones in a blog on modx.com wrote a good article about choosing a control system for the site (from open source solutions), which you can use to communicate with potential customers.  Translated into Russian, the title reads <a href="https://modx.com/blog/read-this-before-you-choose-an-open-source-content-management-system">‚ÄúRead this before choosing an open source content management system</a> , <a href="https://modx.com/blog/read-this-before-you-choose-an-open-source-content-management-system">‚Äù</a> the note itself is in English. </li><li>  <a href="https://modxdevpro.ru/blog/revo/solutions/99-personal-pages-of-users">Personal pages of MODX Revo users</a> - Kirill Korovin wrote a note on his website on how to organize personal pages for users registered on the website.  You should decide what to put on these pages yourself, but the general approach to implementation is described well. </li><li>  <a href="https://modx.pro/news/18049">Several paid applications have become free</a> - Andrey Stepanenko decided to make several of his add-ons free.  On the one hand, this may please someone, since there is no need to pay more money, but at the same time, these additions are now delivered as they are, without guaranteed technical support and development. </li><li>  Under a note with the news about the closure of the MODX club Roman Voropayev <a href="https://modx.pro/news/18100">shared an interesting opinion on the current status of MODX</a> .  No less interesting answer from Sergey Shlokov there.  If you have something to say on this topic, you can join the discussion.  It would be interesting to see the detailed opinions of people on this subject. </li><li>  <a href="https://modx.pro/components/18079">Translitor as an alternative to transliterating pseudonyms</a> - Nikolay Savin proposed his improved class for more ‚Äúcorrect" transliteration of pseudonyms, the implementation of which was peeped in a similar solution from the world of Laravel.  Similar behavior can be achieved with standard tools by changing the system settings, but it may be possible to install the package in one click by someone in an easier way. </li><li>  <a href="https://ilyaut.ru/advice-and-solutions/using-preset-templates-for-tinymce/">The use of predefined templates for TinyMCE</a> is a note about the capabilities of the TinyMCE editor, which is often used in MODX.  Namely, how it is possible for the editor to prepare in advance the blank blocks, which at the time of editing can be selected and inserted into the document.  Almost like ContentBlock, only simpler and free. </li></ul><br><h2 id="novinki-i-obnovleniya-dopolneniy">  New and updated add-ons </h2><br><ul><li>  <strong>modRetailCRM-2.5.0</strong> - updated the package for integrating MODX with RetailCRM, which now supports full-fledged work with modifications from msOptionsPrice2, and also can unload goods with all properties in xml-format.  Nikolai Savin, the author, <a href="https://modx.pro/components/18062">wrote a short note about the update</a> . </li><li>  <strong><a href="https://modx.com/extras/package/admintools">AdminTools-1.15.0</a></strong> - Sergey Shlokov updated his component with a set of convenient tools for admin MODX, adding an indicator of unread messages there and correcting along the way several bugs inside. </li><li>  <strong><a href="https://modx.com/extras/package/twilio">Twilio-0.0.2-beta1</a></strong> is a package for integration into MODX of Twilio service for sending SMS from YJ Tso (sepiariver).  The author has <a href="https://sepiariver.com/modx/twilio-for-modx/">posted</a> documentation on use <a href="https://sepiariver.com/modx/twilio-for-modx/">on his site</a> . </li><li>  <strong><a href="https://modstore.pro/packages/photos-and-files/instafilters">instaFilters-1.0.0-pl</a></strong> is a <strong><a href="https://modstore.pro/packages/photos-and-files/instafilters">terribly</a></strong> simple component that adds a filter to the image shown in the parameter, as in Instagram, but in pure CSS.  Free, <a href="https://modx.pro/components/18061">motivation and examples of use in the author's note</a> . </li><li>  <strong><a href="https://modx.com/extras/package/mchimpx">mChimpX-2.1.0-pl1</a></strong> - Anton Tarasov updated his component, which itself is a hook for FormIt, which allows you to sign a user on the Mailchimp mailing list at the time of sending the form.  Mainly updated line breaks, added translations of some error messages and just fixes bugs. </li><li>  <strong><a href="https://modstore.pro/packages/discounts/mstimestamp">msTimeStamp-1.0.1-beta</a></strong> - Andrei Stepanenko published his free add-on, which allows you to remove statuses of goods (new, special or popular) after some time.  It works without the need to install tasks in the crontab.  <a href="https://modx.pro/components/17997">Read more in the author's note</a> . </li><li>  <strong><a href="https://modstore.pro/packages/content/althelper">altHelper-1.0.1-beta</a></strong> - Pavel, after his <a href="https://modx.pro/solutions/17943">note on solving the problem of automatically filling out alt-attributes in pictures</a> , put together his decision in a free package.  Use. </li><li>  <strong>amoCRM-1.2.1-beta</strong> - Mikhail Voevodsky has released a large update package for integration with amoCRM.  I wanted to list the innovations, but they are specific and in fact there are a lot of them.  Especially since all the fixes are diligently listed in the changelog package. </li><li>  <strong>msPre-2.2.20-pl</strong> - a large component update for mass editing of resources (or even products).  Of the new features - selected resources and filter on them for faster catalog management and also the rapid creation of groups of products through the minishop.  <a href="https://modx.pro/components/18068">More details in the author's note</a> . </li></ul><br><p>  <strong>Thanks for attention!</strong> </p><br><p>  If you notice a mistake - please write me. <br>  Write questions and suggestions in <a href="https://t.me/alroniks">telegrams</a> . <br>  You can send a link to the digest through <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdOdEnBweIxSgKCTGIupyZ6TuqsNlbhHofIqRROoPdGAGSNCA/viewform">this form</a> . <br>  More news and comments on the <a href="https://t.me/modxdigest">MODX Digest</a> Telegram channel. </p><br><p>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/447894/">‚Üê Previous edition</a> </p><br><p>  Do not forget to say thanks to the author! </p><br><p>  <strong>You can support the podcast and digest and generally everything that I do for MODX by <a href="https://www.patreon.com/ivanklimchuk">becoming a patron on Patreon.com</a> or by <a href="https://money.yandex.ru/to/41001878021446/1000">transferring any reasonable amount to your wallet in Yandex.Money</a> .</strong>  <strong>Thank you in advance!</strong> </p><br><p>  PS From the digest, links to paid components are cut in order not to violate the rules of the sites where the digest is published.
