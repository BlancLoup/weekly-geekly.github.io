    <h2>  <b>A bit of background</b> </h2><br>  In May 2016, VMware decided to take a course on developing browser-based thin clients.  Then representatives of the company <a href="https://blogs.vmware.com/vsphere/2016/05/goodbye-vsphere-client-for-windows-c-hello-html5.html">announced</a> the termination of support for a C # client for the vSphere (which was a fat client).  Instead, they offered users the Host Client system and the vSphere Web Client.  The first allowed to manage individual ESXi servers through a web interface, and the second - to work with the virtualization infrastructure through vCenter. <br><br>  The Web Client was based on Flash technology.  However, shortly after the release of the Flash client, users <a href="https://searchservervirtualization.techtarget.com/news/450425633/Upgraded-vSphere-web-client-fails-to-fix-old-complaints">began to complain</a> that it was seriously ‚Äúslowing down‚Äù.  It got to the point that administrators of some companies ‚Äúrolled back‚Äù and postponed updates in order to retain the ability to work with a C # client. <br><br>  The company VMware took note of the claims of users and began to develop a new client for vSphere, already based on HTML5. <br><br>  At first, VMware suggested that administrators use the HTMLS client <a href="https://labs.vmware.com/flings/vsphere-html5-web-client">vSphere Client Fling</a> , which was created specifically for vSphere 6.5.  We have already <a href="https://habr.com/company/it-grad/blog/319612/">described the</a> vSphere Client Fling v3.0 solution in one of our materials.  One of its key features was the function of deploying a VM from a template in the Content Library and an OVF template. <br><br>  But Client Fling was a kind of intermediate solution.  And this fall, it will be replaced by a full-featured HTML5 client.  It will be available for vSphere version 6.7. <br><br>  In fairness, we note that the work on Fling did not stop.  Now for users there is a version of vSphere Client Fling v3.41, in which the developers have added PowerCLI automation.  In this update for Fling'a <a href="https://blogs.vmware.com/vsphere/2018/05/fully-featured-html5-based-vsphere-client-coming-fall-2018.html">promise</a> to release every week. <br><br><h2>  <b>Why HTML5</b> </h2><br><h4>  <i>Security (compared to Flash)</i> </h4><br><ul><li>  WhiteHat Security estimates that Adobe accounts for 14% of all web application vulnerabilities.  One of them was discovered at the beginning of this week - <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/09/patch-tuesday-september-2018-edition/">speech about CVE-2018-15967</a> .  There are few details about it (for example, it is known that attackers can gain access to user data with its help), but Adobe has noted the level of its importance as ‚Äúimportant‚Äù.  The developers have already <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/flash-player/apsb18-31.html">rolled out a</a> patch for it, simultaneously releasing <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/adobe-patch-update-tackles-six-critical-vulnerabilities-in-coldfusion/">five more patches</a> . </li></ul><br><ul><li>  HTML5 is an open solution (not proprietary, like Flash) and is <a href="https://html5sec.org/">being developed with the support of companies</a> such as Facebook, Google and PayPal.  Therefore, it is considered that the security situation in HTML5 is better.  In this case, all updates for HTML5 are installed along with updates for browsers (they do not need to be installed separately, as is the case with Flash). </li></ul><br><h4>  <i>HTML5 less load devices</i> </h4><br><ul><li>  According <a href="http://iss.oy.ne.ro/HTML5-Video-Battery">to the test results</a> , devices that work with HTML5 consume 17% less energy than in the case of Flash.  This allows you to significantly save battery mobile gadgets. </li></ul><br><h4>  <i>Browser Compatibility</i> </h4><br><ul><li>  A number of users of the vSphere Flash client <a href="https://searchservervirtualization.techtarget.com/news/450425633/Upgraded-vSphere-web-client-fails-to-fix-old-complaints">have faced</a> browser compatibility issues.  For example, the system administrator of the Greenbrier Companies Transport Corporation said that he had to operate seven different desktop clients, and he had to use different browsers to work with them. </li></ul><br><blockquote>  All these features affect the popularity of both technologies.  According <a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/3796/websites-using-flash/">to</a> Statista, in 2011, Flash used half of the websites, and in 2016 - only 10%.  At the same time, <a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/ml-html5/all/all">according to data for this year</a> , 73% of all sites use HTML5.  At the same time, Adobe generally <a href="https://theblog.adobe.com/adobe-flash-update/">stops</a> supporting Flash by 2020 - this is another reason why VMware focused its efforts on developing an HTML5-based client. </blockquote><br><h2>  <b>What's new</b> </h2><br><h4>  <i>Admin tools</i> </h4><br><ul><li>  In the HTML5 version, we <a href="https://searchvmware.techtarget.com/feature/VMware-vSphere-HTML5-client-enhancements-prompt-upgrade-buzz">added</a> a feedback tool that allows system administrators to take screenshots in the system and send them directly to the technical support service. </li></ul><br><ul><li>  Also, developers <a href="https://vmiss.net/2018/04/17/update-manager-new-and-improved-html5-vsphere-6-7-client/">have improved the</a> utility for updating vSphere <a href="https://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/funkcionalnost/novaya-funkcionalnost-v-vmware-vsphere-6-7/">Update Manager</a> clusters.  The new version of the manager ‚Äútaught‚Äù to automatically update ESXi-hosts.  A <a href="https://searchvmware.techtarget.com/feature/VMware-vSphere-HTML5-client-enhancements-prompt-upgrade-buzz">number of hotkeys were</a> also <a href="https://searchvmware.techtarget.com/feature/VMware-vSphere-HTML5-client-enhancements-prompt-upgrade-buzz">added</a> (including Alt + F4, the lack of which in the Flash client <a href="https://blogs.vmware.com/vsphere/2018/05/fully-featured-html5-based-vsphere-client-coming-fall-2018.html">caused some users to be dissatisfied</a> ). </li></ul><br><h4>  <i>Improved usability</i> </h4><br><ul><li>  Host information can now be monitored at the cluster level using a separate repository status page.  You can also use all the "features" of the browser: bookmarks, navigation, zoom. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bv/qr/1f/bvqr1fgwg3-clojf4ndwg09r0mu.jpeg"><br>  <font color="#A9A9A9"><i>/ photo by <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/bike/198959255/">Richard Masoner</a> <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/">CC</a></i></font> <br><br><h4>  <i>There are plugins</i> </h4><br>  In order to improve performance for the HTML5 vSphere 6.7 client <a href="https://blogs.vmware.com/vsphere/2018/06/vsphere-6-7-client-plugin-readiness.html">,</a> nine plug-ins <a href="https://blogs.vmware.com/vsphere/2018/06/vsphere-6-7-client-plugin-readiness.html">are available</a> .  Among them, there is a plugin for <a href="https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/5.5/com.vmware.vsphere.storage.doc/GUID-ACC10393-47F6-4C5A-85FC-88051C1806A0.html">Virtual SAN</a> ‚Äî software-defined storage and a plugin for <a href="https://www.vmware.com/products/vsphere/integrated-containers.html">vSphere Integrated Containers</a> ‚Äî a technology that helps manage Docker virtual containers on vSphere. <br><br>  However, some users <a href="https://searchvmware.techtarget.com/feature/VMware-vSphere-HTML5-client-enhancements-prompt-upgrade-buzz">believe</a> that this number of plug-ins is not enough for normal operation and in some cases will have to use the functionality of the old web client.  For example, in the HTML5 version there will be no plug-in for <a href="https://www.vmware.com/support/pubs/orchestrator_pubs.html">vRealize Orchestrator</a> - data center and cloud management systems. <br><br>  In response, VMware <a href="https://searchvmware.techtarget.com/feature/VMware-vSphere-HTML5-client-enhancements-prompt-upgrade-buzz">promised to</a> gradually add all plug-ins supported by the previous client to future versions of vSphere, as well as to improve and expand the capabilities of the HTML5 client based on the wishes of users. <br><br><hr><br>  PS Additional reading in our blog about IaaS: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/funkcionalnost/novaya-funkcionalnost-v-vmware-vsphere-6-7/">New functionality in VMware vSphere 6.7 - an overview of new features</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/funkcionalnost/organizaciya-blokchejn-na-vmware-vsphere-ot-teorii-k-praktike/">Organizing the blockchain on VMware vSphere: from theory to practice</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/funkcionalnost/evolution-vmware-vmotion/">VMware vMotion Evolution: yesterday, today, tomorrow</a> </li></ul><br>  PPS Related articles from our blog on Habr√©: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/company/it-grad/blog/319612/">VMware Introduces HTML5 Client vSphere Client Fling v3.0</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/company/it-grad/blog/415765/">Why VMware decided to create a platform for developing corporate blockchains</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/423419/">https://habr.com/ru/post/423419/</a></p>
