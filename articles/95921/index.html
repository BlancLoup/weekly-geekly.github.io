  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Learning to make money without copyright - how to make money on a simple idea?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Dear habrovchane, I had one funny problem.  I have not yet come up with solutions.  The problem lies in the field of intellectual values ‚Äã‚Äã(IC).  I intentionally do not want to use the term intellectual property (IP), because I believe that the ownership of information is absurd. <br><br>  The essence of the problem is the following: I came up with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãincreasing the competitiveness of a certain type of food.  The idea is terribly simple, I would say, trivial, so I do not see it as possible to patent it (and this contradicts my position on IC).  The manufacturer who first learns the idea can very easily implement it at home (this does not require a special investment).  As a result of implementation, its products will differ significantly from competitors' products in a better direction for buyers.  Sales of products will increase, market share will increase.  How can I make money on it? <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Since an idea cannot be patented, this idea is very easy to borrow.  The manufacturer, who gets the idea first, will be able to be protected from copying by competitors only by having the ‚Äúmodified‚Äù products enter the market earlier.  He can also emphasize in his advertising campaign what he comes up with and copy from him, which means he is more innovative, advanced and generally the coolest.

      <br>
      The problem with the idea is that it is very simple.  If you tell the manufacturer of these products about it, he will say that he himself has thought of it for a long time and is already launching the idea into a series, but keeps it a secret, and having learned about the idea, he will run to implement it at a run (it is very simple and not expensive).  Perhaps I am not the only one who has thought of this idea, but I have not found examples of its implementation.  Perhaps the producers will come up with this idea themselves, I don‚Äôt mind, I won‚Äôt claim for money. <br><br>  An analogue of this idea could be the production of cold tea in cans.  It was not thought out for a very long time to produce it in such a form, but as soon as they thought it out, all the key market players released such products.  To patent it is impossible, to present any rights to this idea - it is meaningless. <br><br>  Attention is the question - how can you earn at least some money on such a simple idea?  I‚Äôm not looking for a way to limit the use of the idea before paying me any money, I‚Äôm looking for a way with a high degree of probability to receive money if the <b>idea is implemented and brings profit to the ‚Äúincarnator‚Äù</b> . <br><br>  The way ‚Äúto enter this market myself‚Äù is not to offer - the starting barrier is high and I will not beat it off in that short period while I have an advantage. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/95921/">https://habr.com/ru/post/95921/</a></p>
