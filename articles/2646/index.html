Rather, too much is not true to perceive it differently than the cry of the soul.  Pro prices, for example, are written by rubbish ... Here is an online store in the UK <a href="http://www.sainsburystoyou.com/">www.sainsburystoyou.com</a> .  Prices are comparable with Moscow, in some places higher, in places lower (I will not even compare with Kopeyka and prices in the markets).  Where does this categorical rating come from? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Agricultural products we can not be cheaper.  Just because our super-cheap labor has scanty productivity, its efficiency tends to zero.  Moreover, our men are in the ranks with an enviable inconstancy.  What can there be planning and setting up business processes?  If we add to this not the best conditions for growing anything, lack of money for fertilizers and agricultural equipment, as well as huge distances with bad roads, then everything becomes clear.

      Western "food manufacturers" can provide cheaper products due to the fact that they receive subsidies from the state, have developed sales channels, "long" loans for equipment, favorable conditions for equipment leasing and a highly competitive market that forces the development and improvement of the entire production process. <br><br>  Our market is only in its infancy.  During this period, high prices are natural.  I will give an example from life.  In the early nineties, an acquaintance in the Far East did the following: he drove from his small town to Khabarovsk, bought a TV set.  Brought, sold 2 times more expensive.  With this money I bought two TVs.  Brought, sold.  Bought four.  A month later, he had already brought a truck of any equipment and opened a shop.  Try it now!  What is now trading cheat on a budget TV in Eldorado?  The market has reached a certain development and the margin has begun to decline, and the quality of goods and services grow. <br><br>  The same thing will happen and is already happening in other industries. <br><br>  Another example. <br>  When I was in the hosting business N years ago, Highway had a very popular Pyaterochka fare.  For 5 euro per month, it offered 5 MB for the site and 5 MB for mail (later expanded to 50 MB).  No databases, php, perl, cgi.  html, SSI, basic scripts - and be healthy.  But they snapped up Pyaterochka like hotcakes, because in the market there were no offers that were cheaper than 10 ye in principle. <br>  Compare with what is happening now. <br>  Is iron cheaper?  So after all, limits have grown for everything - a lot of places, bases.  And now the sites eat more than 3-5 years ago. <br>  Traffic has become cheaper?  Indeed, at that time serious players did not consider traffic for virtual hosting. <br>  Increased staff costs?  But increased process automation. <br>  Increased rent for offices?  Krupnyakov geographically divided the reception and back office, someone brought the call center outside the metropolis. <br>  Has the margin decreased?  But increased volumes. <br>  Increased market entry price?  Increased investment in infrastructure. <br>  But this is not the limit of price cuts and increase in performance characteristics ... and the changes will occur further. <br><br>  I'm all to the point that you should not panic.  Apocalyptic mood can be crammed away.  In our country, everything is not so bad.  You need quite a bit: to work on yourself and develop the areas in which you rotate.  Do Your Best, and the market will put everything in its place and we will be happy. <br><br>  :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/2646/">https://habr.com/ru/post/2646/</a></p>
