  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Car audio as headset for phone</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  With a small car and using a head unit, you can run into the lack of USB, to play music from a USB flash drive and the lack of Bluetooth, to use the speakerphone, play music from the phone. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/895/858/cf7/895858cf7c104813a883d8ffbed896f6.jpg"></div><br><br>  The use of the AUX IN connector partially helped out, with a simple 3-pin Jack 3.5 mm cable - 3-pin Jack 3.5 mm.  Thus, the car audio system was used as a speaker for the phone.  This use is associated with some inconveniences: <br><ul><li>  To switch music, you have to use the touchscreen display of the phone, while the music application is minimized, the screen is turned off, the system is under a password; </li><li>  the answer to the call is somewhat simpler, but no one has canceled the touchscreen display; </li><li>  during a conversation with me, people complained that I was hard to hear, which is connected with a far enough for a built-in microphone, the placement of the phone from the driver. </li></ul><br>  My walks were not originally related to pulling the phone out of my pocket to switch music or answer a call, and the microphone was close enough.  Rescued wired headset.  Why, instead of small speakers from headphones, would you not connect big speakers from a car?  Of course, everything was done with a 3-pin Jack 3.5 mm plug, but the car audio system has become a headset for the phone. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  From available tools there was an old <a href="">Sony Ericsson MH-650</a> headset from the <a href="">Sony Ericsson Xperia arc S</a> and a 3-pin Jack 3.5 mm - 3-pin Jack 3.5 mm cable.  From these elements, it was decided to make a cable 3-pin Jack 3.5 mm - <b>4-pin</b> Jack 3.5 mm, with a microphone and a button.  At the stage of testing the headset performance on a new phone model, I had to find out what <a href="http://rones.su/techno/raspinovka-garnitur-trrs-staraya-i-novaya.html">OMTP and CTIA are</a> .  It turned out that the OMTP standard was used on the Xperia arc S, and the new <a href="">Sony Xperia Z1 Compact used</a> CTIA.  Of course, you can find an easy way: <br><ul><li>  there are special OMTP adapters &lt;-&gt; CTIA; </li><li>  Buy a new headset with CTIA pinout. </li></ul><br>  Then you would have to redo only one part, dropping out the speakers, and in their place soldering Jack 3.5 mm. <br>  Both options were noted, because the new connectors do not add aesthetics to the devices, but we wanted to use the headset, which had been idle for 2 years.

      Based on an article from the PCTUNER website, <a href="http://pctuner.ru/page-al-sony_mh750.html">Sony MH750 Headset Modification for 2011 smartphones</a> , which describes a conversion of the headset from CTIA to OMTP, the reverse transformation was performed, from OMTP to CTIA. <br><br>  Unfortunately, the photographing process was not carried out, so I will explain all the work in the figures.  Pictures will be presented without unnecessary pads for better understanding.  An idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat the board itself looks like can be obtained from the PCTUNER article. <br><br>  Initially, contact connections look like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3f1/284/018/3f12840183754509aedb0e704a52a0d6.png"><br><br>  <b>Before working with the headset, make sure that the markings on the contacts match the tester!</b> <br><br>  It is necessary to swap the wires coming to M + and M-, and to make a jumper between the contact pads M- and G.  We get a headset converted from OMTP to CTIA: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3e5/181/90f/3e518190f72c44d8bf468bac8f511e4c.png"><br><br>  It remains to cut the 3-pin Jack 3.5 mm, with the wire of the required length and solder the wire to the board.  Contacts should be connected as follows: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/520/a4e/c69/520a4ec6923343d8949c0df0aa7f16f8.png"><br><br>  You can fix everything, pour hot melt and put the board in the case.  How did it happen with me: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4b3/aed/72a/4b3aed72a51045dea7ecdea7b33dc66f.JPG"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b48/2bd/e0c/b482bde0c8714138ad8484ff46b026c7.JPG"><br><br>  He soldered for the second time in his life, so he didn‚Äôt know that it was possible to tie a knot at the end of the soldered wire, which later also fit in the case, so my design was not very reliable, the wires are held in place only by solder and hot melt.  I am lucky, this cable has been living for several months. <br><br>  When using such a device, the inconveniences described at the beginning of the article disappeared, and an additional function was found.  If you hold the button on the cable headset, the Google Search application starts, with voice recording active.  As you know, now Google Search is not just a voice search, but also a great program for voice control of the phone.  You can call (‚ÄúCall% contact%‚Äù), send SMS (‚ÄúSend SMS% contact% with text% text%‚Äù), build a route in Google Maps, start the application and, I think, some other things.  For security reasons, if the device has a password, then voice control is not available until you unlock it.  For quick unlocking, you can use the <a href="http://repo.xposed.info/module/pk.qwerty12.nfclockscreenoffenabler">NFC LockScreenOff Enabler</a> module for <a href="http://repo.xposed.info/module/de.robv.android.xposed.installer">Xposed</a> and the NFC tag.  It is enough to turn on the screen and hold the phone over the NFC-tag.  The tag can be pulled out of a regular travel card on the subway, soaking the card with water.  This method of unlocking will be available only to those who have <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A0%25D1%2583%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B3">Root-rights</a> , installed by Xposed and, of course, the NFC LockScreenOff Enabler module.  There was still an application on Google Play that allowed you to unlock the device when you received a unique NFC tag code, but in the locked Android device, the NFC module in the phone is turned off, therefore, for the application to work, you need a modified application that is responsible for the operation of the NFC module (usually This is NfcNci.apk), which, for some devices, is somewhat more difficult than installing Xposed, especially for replacing NfcNci.apk, you also need root-rights. <br><br>  As an analogue, you can use a regular Bluetooth-headset, with a 3-pin Jack 3.5 mm jack for connecting headphones.  This analog has the advantage that it can be used immediately, without labor costs, and the phone does not need to be manually connected all the time.  Still, it is not without flaws, the Bluetooth headset must be charged, turned on / off before use.  Due to the need for charging, it cannot be stored permanently in the car, and if it is charged in the car, it will occupy a valuable 12 V socket, through which the phone is usually charged. <br><br>  Recently, I found analogs of such a cable headset, <a href="http://store.apple.com/us/product/MHDV2G/A/beats-remotetalk-cable">Beats RemoteTalk Cable</a> , for $ 29.95 and the <a href="http://store.griffintechnology.com/headphone-control-adapter">Griffin Headphone Control Adapter</a> , for $ 9.99 (price with a discount of $ 10), and for Griffin you also need a 3-pin Jack 3.5 mm - 3-pin Jack 3.5 mm.  Make yourself much more pleasant, especially since the price of Beats RemoteTalk Cable, in Russia, is 1,490 rubles, which can be spent more usefully. <br><br>  The presented material, of course, may seem very simple, but I have never met such solutions anywhere, I hope the article will be useful. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/239163/">https://habr.com/ru/post/239163/</a></p>
