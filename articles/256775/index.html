More and more programs are being ‚Äúcompiled‚Äù from modules-libraries, more and more journalistic short news materials can be collected automatically from typical strapping around ‚Äúbare facts‚Äù.  Experiments on programming automation and writing articles by artificial intelligence have already entered the preindustrial phase.

      But there should be no pessimism: mankind is not scattered by top-notch experts - the usual transfer from drying out industries to gaining strength will occur.  About 15 years ago, when the first Internet wave in journalism had already formed, at the meeting in the office of Yassen Zassoursky, dean of the Faculty of Journalism of Moscow State University, the question ‚Äú <i>Well, is there really a lot of journalists here? !!</i> ‚Äù Yasen Nikolayevich sadly shook his head.  In the large office there were several tables, on which Mount Everest books, magazines, newspapers, almanacs, saturated with thoughts and time, stood on the heights of the mountains.  And we had a hot hour discussing with the doctor of philology where to turn the path of future graduates of journalism.  Honestly, life still turned out to be richer than our speculations: <b>blogs and Facebook, YouTube and news aggregators, peculiar to the uniqueness of Twitter, communities around traveling photographers and like-minded commentators around all sorts of thematic resources</b> - all this diversity could not even appear in most pink dreams at the turn of the century.  It is symptomatic that the grandson of Yasen Nikilaevich, ‚ÄúInternet researcher‚Äù Ivan Zassoursky, heads the New Media department at the Faculty of Journalism. <br><br>  We will continue the positive dose and see which trends can strengthen the position of leading journalists in their desire to influence all large groups of people, and how the Big Data industry can help with this re / evolutionary explosion: <br><br>  <b>1. Identify new trends</b> <br>  A typical example is the Chelyabinsk meteorite.  Those.  we are talking about a completely new entity that previously did not exist, or an object whose information background was minimal for a long time. <br><br>  <b>2. Change in existing trends</b> <br>  For example, elections in France: there are three political forces and three persons (Hollande, Sarkozy, Marie Le Pen), there is a division of society into those who have already made their choice and those who hesitate.  The goal of the ‚Äúplayers‚Äù is to get the largest possible percentage of the votes of the undecided voters.  You should constantly analyze trends and reactions to actions and campaign promises. <br><br>  <b>3. Ratings of interests (media persons, thematic events)</b> <br>  In any field of society there are leaders recognizable by society: these are individuals (football players, politicians, scientists, musicians), and objects (Sosa-Cola, Moscow, Sberbank, Zenit).  The very fact of getting into a thematic rating or a change in positions in ratings is a signal of changes in the public information field. <br><br>  In the previous series, it was already said about the need to distinguish between approaches: <br>  A) personalized multi-data-per-object, <br>  B) the information field of data in the industry and around objects. <br><br>  Until recently, for journalists and the public, which received the main stream of data almost exclusively from the media, there was in fact no alternative to option ‚ÄúA‚Äù (topic ‚ÄúDossier‚Äù).  Newcomers (people, brands) needed to actively interact with the press in order to get into the circle of objects mentioned by the media. <br><br>  With the development of social media, the direction of the vector has changed significantly: <br>  - <b>‚ÄúSensors‚Äù</b> (people, companies, structures, robots) generate and constantly generate data in the information field; <br>  - The <b>media adapts</b> to the new reality - because of the competition for the speed of news release, the editorial staff creates monitoring groups for the early detection of information leads; <br>  - <b>The role of the media is changing</b> - because of the sharply increased overall flow of materials in the world, thematic focusing and polarization of the opinions of specific media takes place; <br>  - <b>The role of the media is declining</b> - people are increasingly using other information flows, competition is becoming tougher over the time of people, which is 24 hours a day. <br><br>  Here are the interesting data obtained from Brand Analytics on the Russian-speaking information field for the week of April: <br>  Date - News - News Comments <br>  04/02/2015 ..... 147 607 ... 68 957 <br>  04/03/2015 ..... 126 685 ..103 503 <br>  04.04.2015 ... 69 924 ... 85 015 <br>  04/05/2015 ... 58,961 ... 78,819 <br>  04/06/2015 ... 121,247 ... 92,784 <br>  04/07/2015 ... 148 011 ... 104 245 <br>  04/08/2015 ... 189 650 ... 92 011 <br><br>  Those.  <b>862 thousand news was published in a week</b> , to which <b>625 thousand comments</b> were made <b>.</b> <br><br>  For those who are more comfortable to think in the data format for the month - data for March: <b>news - 3.7 million, comments to them - 2.7 million. In total, 6.4 million</b> ‚Äúabout-media articles‚Äù are received.  Quite a bit (0.5%) of the flow in <b>1 BILLION of Russian-language messages in social networks</b> (plus a few blogs, forums, review sites, etc.) generated by people who are ‚Äúsensors‚Äù around the world. <br><br>  Therefore, it is not surprising that an unexpectedly occurring phenomenon - the same ‚ÄúChelyabinsk meteorite‚Äù - took just a <b>few minutes</b> to appear in social networks (Twitter, YouTube, VKontakte) and as much as <b>2-3 hours</b> for the first information to appear in the media. <br><br>  Thus, modern media (no matter what format they currently operate) make it very important to <b>quickly receive information from the ‚Äúsensors‚Äù</b> (manufacturers' sites, people at the scene, robotic systems), <b>thematic filtering</b> to reduce the ‚Äúomnivorousness‚Äù and more targeted readers, as well as <b>operational rating</b> , which allows you to ‚Äúbe in good shape‚Äù and in time to adjust your view of the world on how the world is perceived by ordinary people. <br><br>  As a real case, let's look at three ratings that are regularly produced by the largest Russian media based on the analysis of large volumes of unstructured information from social media: <br><br>  1. Profile, thematic: <b>monthly citation rating of the Russian media</b> on Lenta.ru <br>  <a href="http://lenta.ru/articles/2015/04/07/bamarch/">lenta.ru/articles/2015/04/07/bamarch</a> <br><br>  2. Non-core, thematic, situational: during the <b>World Cup in Brazil, the</b> site RT (Russia Today) published a daily rating of the most popular ‚Äúhumanity‚Äù materials on the football theme <br>  <a href="http://br-analytics.ru/blog/sovmestnyj-proekt-brand-analytics-i-russia-today-ezhednevny/">br-analytics.ru/blog/sovmestnyj-proekt-brand-analytics-i-russia-today-ezhednevny</a> <br><br>  3. Profile, total: <b>monthly rating of media persons</b> on the RIA Novosti website: <br>  <a href="http://ria.ru/infografika/20150402/1055894152.html">ria.ru/infografika/20150402/1055894152.html</a> <br><br>  Regarding the last rating - media people - of course, much more interesting is the daily rating, reflecting changes in the perception of society.  Here are the Top 50 tables for yesterday (April 26): a separate media rating and a social media rating.  Find many differences :-) <br><br>  The "+" sign next to the person means that this media person was included in today's Top 50 rating for the day and was absent from the Top 50 yesterday.  This rating allows you to immediately assess how much you are aware of yesterday's events of the day - do you understand what exactly served to make Nazarbayev appear on the list (hint: yesterday the presidential elections were held in Kazakhstan). <br><br>  <b>Media rating:</b> <br><br>  No. Quantity Fiz.  face <br>  1 4528 Vladimir Putin <br>  2 1435 Petro Poroshenko <br>  3 1070 Barack Obama <br>  4,959 Nursultan Nazarbayev <br>  5 692 Wladimir Klitschko <br>  6,590 Ramzan Kadyrov <br>  7,438 Arseniy Yatsenyuk <br>  8 390 Joseph Stalin <br>  9 387 Dmitry Medvedev <br>  10 375 Dmitry Rogozin <br>  11 348 Dmitry Peskov <br>  12 337 Adolf Hitler <br>  13 310 Angela Merkel <br>  14,296 Boris Nemtsov <br>  15 295 Vitali Klitschko <br>  16 257 Vladimir Lenin <br>  17,252 Francois Hollande <br>  18 243 Viktor Yanukovych <br>  19 240 Boris Yeltsin <br>  20 209 Alexander Lukashenko <br>  21 188 Rinat Akhmetov <br>  22 188 Joseph Kobzon <br>  23 177 Sergey Shoigu <br>  24,152 Federica Mogherini + <br>  25,115 Ban Ki-moon <br>  26 145 Sergey Lavrov <br>  27 137 Vladimir Soloviev + <br>  28 131 Stepan Bandera <br>  29 123 Yulia Tymoshenko <br>  30 119 Mikhail Saakashvili <br>  31 118 Mikhail Khodorkovsky + <br>  32 115 German Gref + <br>  33 111 Alexander Zakharchenko <br>  34 103 Jose Mourinho <br>  35 98 Robert Downey + <br>  36 96 Kim Kardashian + <br>  37 90 Alexey Navalny <br>  38 86 Mikhail Gorbachev + <br>  39 82 Fabio Capello <br>  40 77 Nadezhda Savchenko <br>  41 75 Alexander Pushkin <br>  42 73 John Kerry <br>  43 72 Oleg Lyashko <br>  44 68 Lionel Messi <br>  45 68 Napoleon Bonaparte + <br>  46 65 Igor Kolomoisky <br>  47 65 Nikita Mikhalkov + <br>  48 65 Jen Psaki + <br>  49 64 Arkady Rotenberg + <br>  50 59 Cristiano Ronaldo + <br><br>  <b>Rating of Social Media:</b> <br><br>  No. Quantity Fiz.  face <br>  1 144539 Vladimir Putin <br>  2 35769 Petro Poroshenko <br>  3 31902 Barack Obama <br>  4 25706 Ramzan Kadyrov <br>  5 23137 Joseph Stalin <br>  6 18729 Vitali Klitschko <br>  7 14936 Adolf Hitler <br>  8 14328 Arseniy Yatsenyuk <br>  9 13440 Wladimir Klitschko + <br>  10 13027 Alexander Pushkin <br>  11 12799 Vladimir Lenin <br>  12 12267 Nursultan Nazarbayev + <br>  13 11995 harry potter <br>  14 11579 Boris Nemtsov <br>  15 9377 Cristiano Ronaldo <br>  16 9326 Erich Maria Remarque <br>  17 8816 Lev Tolstoy <br>  18 8469 Timati <br>  19,8405 Lionel Messi <br>  20 7974 Albert Einstein <br>  21 7799 William Shakespeare <br>  22 7606 Omar Khayam <br>  23 7429 Sergey Yesenin <br>  24 7156 Viktor Yanukovych <br>  25 6843 Sergey Shoigu <br>  26 6452 Dmitry Rogozin <br>  27 6402 Vysotsky Vladimir <br>  28 6189 Dmitry Medvedev <br>  29 5974 Bernard Shaw + <br>  30 5838 Vera Brezhnev <br>  31 5661 Vladimir Solovyov + <br>  32 5642 Alexey Navalny <br>  33 5622 Yulia Tymoshenko <br>  34 5608 Dmitry Peskov <br>  35 5526 Vladimir Zhirinovsky <br>  36 5513 Fabio Capello <br>  37 5426 Zemfira + <br>  38 5391 Johnny Depp <br>  39 5198 Napoleon Bonaparte <br>  40 5006 Anatoly Shary <br>  41 4943 Stepan Bandera <br>  42 4934 Andrey Lenitsky + <br>  43 4929 Boris Yeltsin + <br>  44 4922 Fyodor Dostoevsky <br>  45 4899 Sergey Lavrov <br>  46 4583 Joseph Brodsky + <br>  47 4572 Faina Ranevskaya + <br>  48 4467 Nietzsche <br>  49 4467 Polina Gagarina + <br>  50 4446 Stephen King + <br><br>  For the formation of a daily rating, a stream of <b>30-40 million Russian-language messages is</b> processed, <b>taking into account ‚Äúnon-object linguistics of social media‚Äù</b> , which allows identifying new entities, and not just filtering data with a predefined list of people. <br><br>  Let us summarize and continue our conversation with Yasen Nikolayevich on the topic ‚ÄúHow can more readers please the forces of a small number of journalists?‚Äù As a technocratic approach, we offer ‚Äúmodular journalism‚Äù: <br>  - The <b>information sea generated by ‚Äúsensors‚Äù</b> (people, companies, structures, robots) - for the Russian-speaking segment it is 30-50 million messages per day from 12-15 million ‚Äúsensors‚Äù; <br>  - <b>Analytical system that reveals new trends</b> (‚ÄúChelyabinsk meteorite‚Äù, ‚ÄúEarthquake in Nepal‚Äù); <br>  - <b>Analytical system that tracks changes in existing trends</b> ; <br>  - <b>Analytical system, highlighting named entities</b> (objects) and ranking media objects; <br>  - <b>Rating system for monitoring</b> thematically-related objects. <br><br>  Such a set of modules will allow you to generate <b>from 10 to 90% of</b> materials on your content resource, allowing you to quickly respond to expectations in the information support of readers.  In one way or another, most of the publications have long been moving in this direction (for example, a selection of 5 news on the popular TJournal) - it‚Äôs all about the tools used and the ‚Äútrust‚Äù in us, readers, in terms of understanding our interests. <br><br>  Of course, an intelligent reader will immediately see the danger of template making and ‚Äúkilling‚Äù publications - if every publication (even if it is within its scope, there are still a lot of such) will publish materials on the principle of ‚Äúmodular journalism‚Äù, then why are there so many similar publications!  We do not have an answer to this question now, but we are sure that creative people will definitely find a creative way to the next level :-) <br><br>  <i>UPD: Popularity ratings on the commentary of News Sites, blogs LJ, Twitter, YouTube, VK are available in the public domain on <a href="http://pl.ilook.ru/">pl.ilook.ru</a></i> <i><br></i> <br>  <i>PS For those bloggers, journalists, editors who need or are interested to be in the know, you can send a request to pr@br-anaytics.ru with a request to include your address in the daily mailing list of Media Persons for the past day.</i>  <i>Our colleagues from Brand Analytics are ready to provide free information with ratings of TOP-50 media people until the end of May.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/256775/">https://habr.com/ru/post/256775/</a></p>
