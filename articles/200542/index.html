      <sup>* under the cut, three and a half thousand letters, four photos, three of which are made on the poor iPod camera, and half of the screenshot from the nexus itself</sup> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Review Content: <br><ul><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/200542/">Packing and Shipment</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/200542/">Phone mount</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/200542/">Appearance</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/200542/">Charging and battery specifications</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/200542/">Personal impressions</a> </li></ul><br><br><h4><a name="anc1"></a>  Packing and Shipment </h4><br>  When ordering, the case is sent from Hong Kong, one of the available shipping options.  In my case, the cover was sent by the Post of Russia, which, in spite of the opinion already established on it, showed its best and delivered the parcel not in 2-3 months, but in 3 weeks. <br>  The cover came in a yellow envelope familiar to the recipients of parcels from China.  Inside the package, which protects the cover from the above-mentioned mail.  Packaging (and an envelope, and a plastic box) without problems opens without scissors. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/58c/fb9/ee3/58cfb9ee3c1e0c5120ec6309110184fd.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><br><h4><a name="anc2"></a>  Phone mount </h4><br>  The case covers the phone with a thin rim in the corners, with all the buttons, a microphone and a mini-jack made the correct cutouts.  Only the cutout for microUSB port is too thin, which makes it possible to connect not all cables.  If the ‚Äúnon-native‚Äù cable is slightly thicker - it is no longer inserted until the ‚Äúcharacteristic click‚Äù.  What is forgivable, given that during charging from a third-party source, the cover function is decorative-protective maximum. <br>  Through the entire thickness of the cover, cutouts were made - under the camera with a flash, and a thin cutout under the speaker.  The camera, which is expected, does not interfere with the case (on the contrary, the visor adds <s>, like with cool lenses</s> ), the sound from the speaker is almost not distorted, except that it becomes a little softer softer. <br><br>  And now the promised revelation.  Until I got a case in my hands, I did not think about it, but how the case actually charges the phone.  Wireless charging supported by nexus?  Small hidden microUSB on the loop? <br>  TA-dah!  Why hide. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/69c/784/f27/69c784f27de03e26d4f877d500367c49.jpg" alt="image"><br>  But if you think about it, this is the best option.  Wireless charging entails large losses, and a small train would make it difficult to charge another phone.  Yes, the cover for the Nexus 4 can be charged not only Nexus 4. <br><br><br><h4><a name="anc3"></a>  Appearance </h4><br>  The first impression of the case itself is that it is very pleasant to the touch, soft-touch plastic, combined with rounded edges.  As an added bonus, there are almost no fingerprints on the case.  And for dessert - for the week spent with a case in the company of keys and a wallet in one pocket of a work bag, not a single scratch was noticed on the surface of the plastic. <br>  The second impression is the impressive size, which, however, does not interfere as much as it seemed from photographs.  For its size, the case is pretty light.  Fastened to the phone tightly, without gaps and backlashes, so that this design looks quite monolithic. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ab0/e86/e00/ab0e86e00a3cc59aa0fa0dda86d584ab.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4><a name="anc4"></a>  Charging and battery characteristics </h4><br>  The purpose of this review was not to make accurate laboratory measurements; therefore, all figures were obtained experimentally.  The phone was discharged, for example, with the help of Ingress, then it was charged from the case - during use and during rest. <br><br>  The battery cover is enough for two phone charges (in standby mode), which is quite logical, despite the fact that the stated capacity of the cover battery is more than two times greater than the declared capacity of the phone battery.  Apparently, this is ‚Äúmore than enough‚Äù, made to compensate for power consumption, if the phone is not turned off while charging, but is in standby mode or even doing something. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/51a/ea3/c10/51aea3c100f5d46945b631c0255f4bfb.png" alt="image"><br><br>  From the moment when the phone is completely discharged, and the cover is fully charged, until the moment when the phone shows 100% charge, it takes about 4.5 - 5 hours.  If I use the phone at this time, the charging time increases, but I never managed to create conditions under which the charge of the phone decreased during charging.  So, theoretically, the cover can really support the life of the phone in normal mode, until it sits on its own. <br><br><h4><a name="anc5"></a>  Personal impressions </h4><br>  The main, most important impression is that this battery case cannot be viewed as a case.  Then it turns out that this is a huge bar that encloses your phone, which makes the device larger and less convenient.  Not.  This is primarily an external battery.  And then it is a damn convenient battery that fits very well with your particular phone and does not create any inconvenience during use, as it is attached directly to the phone, leaving all functions available. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/314/73a/30c/31473a30c99aa8272747ce94664513f4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Case for review provided by the <a href="http://mugen.co/">manufacturer</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/200542/">https://habr.com/ru/post/200542/</a></p>
