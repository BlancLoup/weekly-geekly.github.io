Paraphrasing the well-known foreign proverb that ‚ÄúThe main problem of Christianity is Christians,‚Äù in today's business, the key problem of any site today is its team.  No, not a gradient.  Not even the layout.  And absolutely not flat icons.  People. <a name="habracut"></a>

      Comrade Stalin was not mistaken, until now it is the cadres who decide everything and always.  In any business, in the real world, or in the virtual world, everything depends on the concrete person, his skills, abilities, thinking and not indifference.  It is he who animates with his own content all those pixels that are soullessly displayed on our monitors with you.  Well, or zaparyvaet everything to the end. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/296/29d/8ab/29629d8abefa706fe6b438b7380e432c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>What paragraph should start any site audit</b> <br><br>  Correct thinking, well-built processes, intelligible and transparent analytics allow any intelligent people to find and define problems themselves.  Each person is able to identify critical problems in his own business, if not too much is distracted by social networks and smoothies.  But most often this does not happen, but not at all because a certain misleading Cossack from competitors purposely pulls your business to the bottom - on the contrary, your most trusted people are simply not ready for changes in their minds.  After all, all people want, as easy as possible and cheaper, and more desirable quickly and without preparation.  Although in life this is not the case.  And that's why. <br><br>  <b>Paragraphs of adoration psaki</b> <br><br>  I admire everything related to the image of Jennifer Psaki.  I am not personally acquainted with her, but in a carefully crafted image I bow to this woman and I believe that having such people in any team is a reason for a properly built structure, when a person who is absolutely incompetent in geography and braces can come to any position from nowhere in the layout or javascripts - and not to destroy anything: the United States did not go bankrupt with it, did not fall into hell, the Mexicans did not take Texas away from them, etc.  This means that before Jennifer, so many wise people worked in the team, and such communications were established, such a foundation was laid - that now the layman is simply unable to destroy everything. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/9f9/3ea/ed9/9f93eaed96e4223b2e50bd8f725d1e5f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Now compare this situation with your business?  Imagine for a moment that tomorrow psaki will get you a delivery manager, layout designer or art director?  Will it all collapse overnight? <br>  I hear you breathing "yes" in chorus all over the country - yes, because your system is already unsteady and you only need the most expert guru, only the invincible superhero, who daily rescues you from fire and flood at the same time. <br><br>  A similar approach, when only heroism and miracle every day save the situation from collapse - can be seen in our mentality not only in the IT industry.  Each in his place considers himself to be the last surviving infantryman, who daily throws his breast at the ‚Äúenemy‚Äù machine guns - because there is no grenade again, and you will not get air support. <br><br>  Recently, by the will of fate, I attended a very smart conference, where the most pressing problem of a generation was discussed: ‚ÄúHow to raise the prestige of the city?‚Äù.  I suggest you include knowledge of the Russian mentality and indicate in your comments which ideas in your opinion were taken into work, and which were rejected with anger: <br><br>  A) Remove dirt on the streets or make the inscription: "Forward Yekaterinburg" on T-shirts? <br>  B) Repair the roads or pay the new logo for designers? <br>  C) Revise your city management strategy or change the font and button color on the official website of the Internet? <br><br>  That's how we live.  And then we are surprised - why didn‚Äôt it work? Ordinary people couldn‚Äôt understand what, maybe they could even chew on our branding?  Yes, all people understand, and even very well, that's why they turn away. <br><br>  <b>Practice: team structure = site structure</b> <br><br>  How this article will help in practice?  Based on many years of experience, I found the magic method of designing a fast and efficient structure of any site.  Your site should look exactly like your business team - links within it and the entire hierarchy.  So, if you focus on the meaning and content, but not on the lifeless page templates, then the site should completely mirror the very essence of your business.  Examples: <br><br>  A) You are simply an entrepreneur, you do not have warehouses throughout the country, there is no delivery service, personnel department and other factories-newspapers-steamboats.  You also do not have your own content manager and most likely you will not write more than 3 lines about yourself, your offer and achievements.  To expect that the press suddenly also starts to write about you in a massive way is also not necessary. <br>  Solution: make one general page in which 4-5 paragraphs will tell you everything you can about your services, prices, delivery, mission, achievements and development history. <br><br>  B) There are more than 500 people in your team, half of whom do not understand what they are doing at all.  You also have a content manager, cm-specialist and dozens of marketers - super!  This means that the amount of information on the projected site only on the history of the corporation may exceed several thousand characters.  And the most massive profession in your team is movers in dozens of warehouses across the country. <br>  Solution: then the structure of only the delivery section of the site you are designing should look like this: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eac/ff3/102/eacff3102ca44eab9636d4d08d64770d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  B) If you have something in between, let's say a construction team of 15 people: painters, bricklayers and carpenters?  Do I need to give a complete list of hundreds of thousands of pages with descriptions of services, materials, examples of work?  No, the rule ‚ÄúAccording to Senka and the cap‚Äù should work clearly.  Admit it, you never in your life fill hundreds of pages with interesting unique content, even if you yourself write one message a year in your Odnoklassniki profile.  Concentrate on the designed site on key information, and prove the rest to customers at the construction site, not on the site: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9c8/5ef/05e/9c85ef05e4ff483dadb29ed501edb940.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  This approach guarantees the correct formation of the site on the basis of the opportunities available to you personally.  It's simple.  As on the ground - and on the web, make your website by structure - a projection of the real state of affairs, team structures and analyze it as regularly as you collect daily reports on the activities of the company. <br><br>  First people - then pictures.  Do not produce extra essence. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/289030/">https://habr.com/ru/post/289030/</a></p>
