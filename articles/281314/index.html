  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Easla.com review</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Easla.com is a new online electronic document management system (platform).  Designed to manage both data and documents.  Allows you to gradually or automatically automate business processes of any complexity in an organization of any scale. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/03a/90a/39e/03a90a39e6b042d99bbda1515b6a2b8e.png"><br>  - Aaa, again a new system ... - you will think.  But, I propose to hold skepticism a little and get acquainted with the capabilities and features of the system, before writing it into a ‚Äúlong list‚Äù called ‚Äúheard - know‚Äù. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  The main advantages of easla.com </h4><br><h5>  Easy to use </h5><br>  The system is extremely easy to use for the end user, i.e.  first of all for the employee of the organization.  After authorization, the employee is always on the same page, which only changes its content.  It has access to a menu of processes, created objects, as well as a selection of objects or the shape of a single object.  That's all!  Nothing extra!  Just what you need for work! <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/223/b0a/fcf/223b0afcfe6f4f039d449ebfa772c33f.png"><br><br><h5>  Cost of </h5><br>  The system is free at the initial stage of use and allows you to automate business processes without attracting initial investment in software or hardware (which is extremely important in the current environment).  Depending on the intensity of use, you can use the system for a long time for free or using the minimum plan. <br><br><h5>  Versatility </h5><br>  In <a href="http://easla.com/">easla.com</a> , business processes of any complexity can be implemented, from simple ones with a couple of roles and without statuses, to complex ones with dozens of roles and intricate transitions between statuses.  For example, you can start with the deployment of the process of managing contractors and contacts, then move on to managing calls, appeals, incidents, changes, tasks, to whom that is closer.

    <h5>  Multi-organization </h5><br>  Each <a href="http://easla.com/">easla.com</a> administrator can create and manage several organizations independently, but, if necessary, can provide employees of different organizations with the opportunity to work <u>together in one process</u> !  For this, it is enough to make employees of one organization part-time workers in another and include them in appropriate roles.  In the main menu, part-timers will have processes of another organization (see the screenshot below), and they will be able to participate in them in accordance with the roles they occupy. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2b7/3ab/439/2b73ab4397e1453eb45e141033f2f706.png"><br><br><h5>  Availability </h5><br>  Of course, the online system is available wherever there is Internet access.  You do not need any VPN, terminal access and other difficulties, just access to the site.  The security of data transmission is ensured by the https protocol. <br>  In addition, the system easily integrates with other existing systems or applications via SOAP and MS SQL.  There is a real experience of integration with Microsoft Word and CSoft TDMS.  Using the <a href="http://easla.com/ru/site/page/view/tools">Easla Agent</a> you can work with <a href="http://easla.com/">easla.com</a> via COM.  Recently, the ability to transfer files to FTP. <br><br><h5>  Speed </h5><br>  The system allows you to very quickly start business processes by borrowing and adapting existing processes published by other administrators to fit your needs, as well as quickly making changes to them in real time <u>without compiling</u> . <br>  All published processes can be easily borrowed and guarantee operability in 90% of cases.  The <a href="http://easla.com/">easla.com</a> cannot give a complete guarantee of the efficiency of the borrowed business process, since  the process may have dependencies that it cannot track.  In general, you should not be disappointed if after borrowing the process does not start or gives an error.  You just need to understand the causes and eliminate them.  As a last resort, you can always write a letter to the technical support or to the author of the process and you will definitely be helped! <br>  Oh yes!  The speed of the system itself is also at a decent level.  At the moment, she successfully rolls tens of thousands of objects with almost a million attributes! <br><br><h4>  System features </h4><br><h5>  Work with files </h5><br>  Working with files through the browser is inconvenient.  Constant downloading and uploading files will tire anyone. <br>  You can avoid these procedures in <a href="http://easla.com/">easla.com</a> using the <a href="http://easla.com/ru/site/page/view/tools">Easla Agent</a> , which allows you to work with files in the same way as if they were located locally.  Clicking on the link does not download the file, but opens it in the corresponding application, each saving of the file automatically uploads it back to the server (in fact, the file is of course downloaded and uploaded, but not by the browser). <br>  In addition, <a href="http://easla.com/">easla.com</a> implements a file revision (version) mechanism that can be turned on or off, <a href="http://easla.com/">thus</a> ensuring safe work with files. <br>  By the way, files are stored in attributes in the same way as other data, therefore any object can contain several attributes of the file type.  For example, in an outgoing letter it is convenient to store a separate file with a letter - it must always be one and a certain format, and separate application files - there may be several and different formats.  It's great! <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2e2/928/40a/2e292840a35043d1bedec7395db783b0.png"><br><br><h5>  Work calendar </h5><br>  The work or production calendar is a unique tool for managing workdays and holidays of each organization.  With it, in <a href="http://easla.com/">easla.com</a> you can calculate time intervals not on calendar, but on working days.  For example, in the process of managing tasks, there is always the question of calculating the planned closing date of a task based on certain standards of time for its execution.  The conditions for calculating the planned date may include the urgency of the task, the category of the task, the type of customer and other criteria, and as a result, the task must be calculated the planned date and time of closure, taking into account working time, excluding weekends and holidays.  Using a working calendar easla.com to perform such a calculation is easy! <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1e3/83f/1ff/1e383f1ffd2e4630ba5b88fafd6ffb21.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2be/adb/80f/2beadb80f45f4cd1a81c439d2f564dfc.png"><br><br><h5>  Work with users </h5><br>  Users in <a href="http://easla.com/">easla.com</a> can not only be added manually one by one, but also imported via LDAP. In addition, users can even log in to the system using a domain account!  Of course, for the sake of this convenience, the administrator will have to put the system into the domain, but usually it does not cause difficulties. <br><br><h5>  Earning opportunity </h5><br>  Any <a href="http://easla.com/">easla.com</a> administrator has the ability to manage multiple organizations and can create an unlimited number of processes in them.  Thus, he can independently or with the help of his team earn money on automating the business processes of his clients! <br><br><h5>  Process publishing </h5><br>  Each administrator can publish their process for public use.  Imagine, you can develop a process that will perfectly show itself in work, and share it with a community of the same specialists.  In response, get useful feedback, discuss the nuances and correct mistakes.  The process will automatically receive a unique designation, and as it is borrowed by other administrators will increase its rating!  Who knows, maybe your business process will be the benchmark and books will be written about you! <br>  As a result, you can borrow business processes published by other administrators and thus achieve a ‚Äúquick start‚Äù!  (see the following article in a couple of days) <br><br><h4>  Results </h4><br>  I do not call right now to go to <a href="http://easla.com/">easla.com</a> , because  the system may seem complicated at first glance unprepared administrator.  In the next article I‚Äôll talk about how to administer a simple process to an administrator and to be in the user section for the first time. <br><br>  PS All impatient can feel free to write all the questions at <a href="">support@easla.com</a> .  I promise - we will answer all! <br>  PPS At the moment the system is ready to work in Russian.  In English.  language in the translation process. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/281314/">https://habr.com/ru/post/281314/</a></p>
