  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Education Passport instead of a higher education diploma. Prototype from MyEducationPath.com</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A diploma of higher education is an important element of a successful career.  The presence of qualifications in describing vacancies almost always means having a corresponding diploma, and, moreover, a state sample.  Cases when a qualified job accepted a person without a diploma are an exception. <br><br>  The discussion about changes in the global system of higher education is heating up with a new force, but the state diploma is still one of the main arguments for the traditional HE system.  You can complete 30 open online courses in the same subjects as at the university and have a certificate after each course.  But after all the diploma of specialty will not be! <br><br>  However, I believe that changes will occur.  A traditional university will become a multitude of small independent, highly specialized companies competing with each other.  This will not happen because someone wants it.  The reason for the changes will be simple market laws from which it is impossible to escape.  Instead of a diploma, we will demonstrate the history of personal education - Education Passport.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  How does a VO diploma work and why does it work </h4><br><br>  A diploma in HE is important primarily to the employer.  A diploma means that a person studied for 5 years and at the end was tested under the control of the state according to the standards of the same state.  A diploma is a guarantee that a person can do a certain job at the minimum necessary level according to the state. <br><br>  The requirement for a diploma by an employer has two components: <br>  1. Everyone requires me too. <br>  2. Testing the applicant can be reduced.  Having a diploma means something he can.  You can go directly to the details. <br><br>  What happens if the applicant does not have a diploma?  The employer needs to spend more time to determine whether the applicant is suitable or not.  Does he know how to do what he said or not. <br><br>  If there was something else instead of a diploma of higher education confirming qualification?  Perhaps a diploma would not be needed.  The employer has the main qualification of the employee and how much money he will bring to the business. <br><br>  Oh yes.  It is necessary to pay attention to the fact that in large organizations the hiring of new employees can be strongly bureaucratic and there is no need to wait for changes there soon.  For example, in the case of admission to the public service, the employer (people) cannot influence this process at all and somehow optimize it (in the sense that if you want to be an official, you can stop reading, there is no alternative to a diploma for you). <br><br><h4>  What is an education passport in the <a href="http://myeducationpath.com/">MyEducationPath.com</a> view <a href="http://myeducationpath.com/">?</a> </h4><br><br>  If there is no diploma, but the applicant has studied many online courses and also knows what a university graduate.  In this case, you can simply show the potential employer the history of their education. <br><br>  The prototype of the Education Passport is already working on the MyEducationPath.com - <a href="http://myeducationpath.com/page/mypassport.htm">My Education Passport</a> .  An example of an education passport is <a href="http://myeducationpath.com/p/byqydy/John%2BSmith.htm">Education Passport of John Smith</a> . <br><br>  In the passport, you can show the studied courses (including the currently popular MOOC), passed independent exams ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/myeducationpath/blog/198928/">some examples in our blog</a> ), internships, and so on. <br><br>  For each entry in the passport indicates the time and duration.  Entries are sorted in chronological order.  For courses and exams, you can download a digital version of the certificate or provide information about the certificate (many course providers issue a certificate with a number to check online). <br><br>  Personal education passport can be published and the link is included in the summary. <br><br>  Currently, about 500 users of our site have already created their education passport.  These are mainly students of popular MOOC providers such as Coursera, Udacity, edX, and so on. <br><br><h4>  When the education passport will actually act </h4><br><br>  At first glance, such an education passport cannot really work.  After all, you can add any courses, even if you never taught.  Now it is.  But the situation will change.  Already, there is an opportunity to check the certificate online by number or unique code.  When adding a course to an education passport, we will require a certificate number and use it to determine the name of the student in the provider database.  The same for independent exams. This will significantly increase the credibility of the passport of education. <br><br>  The next step is the invention of how to identify students online courses.  You need to be sure that the hundred course studied and the exam was passed by this particular person and not his friend who knows the subject better.  Technologies for this are already there and they are booming. <br><br>  Then it all depends on employers.  For some professions such a passport can work right now.  For example, for programmers.  Education passport can serve as a reason to invite the applicant for an interview.  And then the employer himself will easily determine what the applicant knows and knows how.  The same approach will work in most cases, if necessary, to hire a qualified employee.  We need only successful examples and real market demand for skilled workers. <br><br>  The employer can see the list of courses in the passport.  But how can an employer know which courses are normal and which ones do not teach anything?  To do this, there are ratings of courses.  Ratings from students and from employers themselves.  The employer can evaluate the skills of the employee and this will affect the rating of the rate where the employee studied.  That is, employers can help students choose the right course from hundreds of courses on the desired subject. <br><br><h4>  The diploma will be back.  10 years after leaving. </h4><br><br>  The employer can really view the list of courses studied by the applicant, passed exams and relevant certificates, internships and so on.  But, ultimately, an employer needs to know only one thing, whether a person is able to do the work for which he applies or not. <br><br>  As a result of this need, independent testing centers will offer a service for testing fitness for a specialty.  The applicant pays for trying to pass an exam or a set of exams and receives a certificate or not.  At the same time nobody cares where he studied and how he prepared.  Just checked the set of knowledge and skills necessary for the execution of a particular job.  The certificate of such an exam will be the equivalent of a modern diploma.  Only with minimal participation of the state and complete freedom in choosing ways to prepare for the exam.  Learn where you want, how you want and how much you want.  It does not interest anyone.  The exam will show that you know what you can do.  Did not pass, pay for another attempt and try again. <br><br>  The question arises - which testing centers to trust?  There are 2 options.  Rating from employers can be a sign of the level of testing for other employers.  Or, for "not very market-based" states, one can have a state certification of testing centers.  But ultimately, the market approach should win, because it is more effective. <br><br><h4>  Again.  Why this happens if the traditional diploma works. </h4><br><br>  It's my personal opinion.  I do not give any guarantees.  But once again I will bring my arguments in favor of <br>  quick changes in the system of higher education and crowding out diplomas with an education passport and independent knowledge testing of estates. <br><br>  The traditional VO system is inefficient.  This system is too inert, expensive, bureaucratic.  She lives only because there is no alternative.  If you decompose a traditional university into many independent players, the processes will accelerate and efficiency will increase.  The competition of many small enterprises leads to more fair prices for the final product.  Some products may simply be free as online courses (i.e. university lectures).  Establishing an independent testing center is much easier than a university.  As a result, there will be many centers and, accordingly, market prices and not taken from the ceiling as in a traditional university. <br><br>  The organization of some of the processes of personal education can be skipped, for example, to organize an internship itself.  In the case of a traditional university, this is included in the price and has already been paid.  Thus, the cost of education can be very individual and depends only on the student. <br><br>  The reason for the upcoming changes in the VO system is simple - it is competition.  The old inefficient system will disappear under the pressure of the new effective. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/200726/">https://habr.com/ru/post/200726/</a></p>
