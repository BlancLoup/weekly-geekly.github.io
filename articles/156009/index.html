Since I just stick out of the pieces of iron, I like to squeeze them and look at them, and the brilliance of pancakes from the HDD just fascinates me, I liked the thing and after a while I repeated the experience of others as the skills.  Ahead of the holidays, weekends, and perhaps someone wants to do the same needlework.  Moreover, all this is very simple.  Further traffic and pictures. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4f3/0d7/0bc/4f30d70bce17ab8cf1c4c230fec2a692.jpg" alt="image" width="460"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Minimum set of materials and tools </h4><br><ol><li>  Winchester (better defective) </li><li>  Clockwork (maybe not any) </li><li>  A set of arrows (hour, minute, second) </li><li>  Super glue </li><li>  Double-sided tape or thick tape </li><li>  Screwdriver for disassembling the hard drive </li><li>  Drill or other metalworking tools </li></ol><br>  I had three dead drives in my household.  Patients and conventional instruments when assembling watches: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/092/ac9/4ce/092ac94ce6113102499256bd8536e568.jpg"><br><br>  Particularly useful is a screwdriver with a set of interchangeable bits, a superglue, and a <a href="http://www.buysku.com/wholesale/3-5x-12x-working-magnifier-with-steel-plate-base-led-lamps.html">backlit</a> Chinese <a href="http://www.buysku.com/wholesale/3-5x-12x-working-magnifier-with-steel-plate-base-led-lamps.html">magnifier with BuySKU for $ 14</a> , helping my aging vision.  A set of sprocket keys was needed, as the manufacturers liked to use such screws, but not ordinary, cross ones in new hard drives.  Moreover, these new screws easily lick and unscrew them is almost impossible.  That turned out to be the patient on the right who cracked the WD drive from the Apple iMac.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fc8/d7b/f06/fc8d7bf06b4ddd9b48d4c6afc84832ee.jpg"><br><br>  We analyze patients as much as possible, analyze the contents. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/762/c18/1c4/762c181c487763f0ebd5fa5b5a17b962.jpg"><br><br>  The extreme left, ancient Fudjitsu, turned out to be the most subtle, and therefore the most convenient in my case.  The fact is that the platform of the hard drive is the basis for the clock and you need to somehow place the clock mechanism on it.  For me, the preferred option is always to place the clock at the back.  Some authors cut a hole in the case to the size of the clockwork and in some way match them.  The extreme option on the right (the most modern screw) turned out to be unusable at the moment.  Firstly, the hexagonal slots on the screws licked him, and secondly, the clock mechanism would have to be placed on the front side of the intended watch, sticking forward the pancake, which would most likely hide some of the beautiful mechanism of movement of the heads.  Compare the thickness of the cases, Fudjitsu, Samsung and WD: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/dcd/b20/02d/dcdb2002d0d19f14b039942225e3dfbc.jpg"><br><br>  ‚Ññ‚Ññ 2 and 3 will wait until better times.  Customize other key components.  The donor alarm clock for 70 rubles from Auchan (its gut lies nearby), as well as the clock mechanism for needlewomen from Leonardo for 135 rubles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/88a/060/b56/88a060b5616f52a048e8f08132909850.jpg"><br><br>  It is worth noting that the idea to save money by buying a cheap donor turned out to be unsuccessful: the height of the turntable on which the hands are mounted was too small and it is more difficult to assemble a watch on such a mechanism, since it will be necessary to fit literally a fraction of a millimeter.  What to do - the manufacturer was counting on a thin paper dial.  Compare the height yourself: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/722/8dd/a94/7228dda9402063a3d24eb919a00ca6a3.jpg"><br><br>  Pay attention to the arrows.  Huge arrows on the left bought in the same Leonardo for 75 rubles.  A little expensive for a few drops of painted aluminum, but they are ideally suited to their clockwork.  And it is absolutely not suitable for watches from the hard drive, as they are excessively large.  I will simply cut them off until I find more suitable ones.  The arrows on the right are taken out of the donor and, alas, are only suitable for its clockwork.  Postponing. <br><br>  I also already have a stock of pancakes from different hard drives, different shades and thicknesses: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/573/c0f/9de/573c0f9de8ff38b8e8805e02c9e9e9f9.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Next - the most interesting. </h4><br><br>  As I said above, the options for mounting the clock mechanism may vary depending on the format of the hard drive, the type of clock mechanism used, the hands, the desired result and other restrictions due to the cranks and decisions of the body manufacturer. <br><br>  In my case, I decided to place the undercarriage behind, let the rack for the arrows pass through the engine plate, after having knocked the engine out of it.  Sometimes it is possible to keep the motor in place by knocking out the spindle.  Then the pancake planted back looks more aesthetic.  As an option - you can drill the spindle or use for the scenery very sympatichny clamping plate-pancake washers.  I had no fuss about anything because of the designated time limit.  So, carefully dismantle and knock out the engine: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4cf/179/88f/4cf17988fd24bbfd8e946556ec40e68c.jpg"><br><br>  The hole in the center was too narrow, I had to expand it with a drill.  I do not keep a vice in an apartment, therefore their role is performed by a duty piece of chipboard and self-tapping screws, which fix the part.  This is necessary, because when drilling it gets very hot, and it can just fly off to the side, causing injuries: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/715/ad2/02f/715ad202f6c3d22df0b9713cc9f32d44.jpg"><br><br>  The opening is expanded, we carry out fitting.  We screw the plate into place, insert the mechanism in the back, and we see that in such variants of the thread, which will be above the shiny pancake, it is not enough to fix the mechanism with a nut due to protruding screw heads: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/faa/7d9/33f/faa7d933f33a66eb51df11e42e4d65e2.jpg"><br><br>  The solution comes quickly: we unscrew the screws and glue the plate on the superglue, since the parts fit perfectly and fit perfectly together.  Hats are eliminated, we win the necessary millimeter.  Alternatively, you could glue the clock mechanism on the back to the same superglue or double-sided tape and not use the nut.  But I prefer to assemble so that the product can be disassembled later, without taking anything away. <br><br>  Fix the pancake, press it with a rubber washer and nut to the mechanism, tighten it until it is fully fixed. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6ed/a67/e67/6eda67e67581bce5ea2e1010a3570642.jpg"><br>  Proponents of aestheticism (and I) prefer more technological and beautiful solutions, but I have a time limit.  So that the pancake is not loose, I fix it with three drops of superglue directly to the body of the screw. <br><br>  Side view: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3ca/c40/42c/3cac4042c1d9e8ab2550fe3c611e618b.jpg"><br><br>  We put in place the pre-cropped arrows and previously removed details for the convenience of the mechanism for positioning the heads.  It turned out somewhat <s>ugly</s> unusual, but there are no suitable shooters, therefore, we grind our teeth. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/307/551/9ee/3075519ee8e1dbd43ade28276ee55b08.jpg"><br><br>  The look falls on the remaining screw cap.  Without thinking twice, fasten it from behind, closing the clock mechanism and giving the construction of weight.  Fastening on the wall is ensured by a hole drilled in the lid for ordinary wall nails and dowels: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9ed/405/ff0/9ed405ff023774e2e829710cddeedbdb.jpg"><br><br><h4>  We hang on the wall: </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3ec/d95/27b/3ecd9527b6d9bbee3bb88e084383a83e.jpg"><br><br>  We put in the phone a reminder that you need to buy a fluorescent paint and cover it with arrows and, possibly, some other things. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/156009/">https://habr.com/ru/post/156009/</a></p>
