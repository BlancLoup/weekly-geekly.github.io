I think my favorite activity is to delete the code!  The worst is trying to figure out why some code is as it is.  It is sometimes hard to work on Rails, because in some places the code is outdated, so it‚Äôs difficult to track down where a piece came from or why a particular piece of code is exactly like that. <br><br>  Deleting code.  I think my favorite thing to do is delete code!  It is the way that it is.  It is difficult to track it. <br><br>  <b>What do you consider your main achievement in life / career at the moment?</b> <br><br>  I think so far my main achievement is the performance improvements that I achieved in ActiveRecord (this project is called AdequateRecord).  I have been learning to refactor code for years, so that later I could make such performance improvements.  Pleasant feeling when you work on something for so long and, finally, see the result.  I'm also happy that I managed to improve performance without having to change the public API. <br><br>  I did it on the ActiveRecord (called AdequateRecord).  I could make this type of performance improvement.  It is actually ship.  User interface APIs makes me very happy. <br><br>  <b>In your opinion, in what direction will Ruby and Ruby on Rails develop in the coming years?</b> <br><br>  I hope that in Rails we can improve the performance of HTTP in Ruby web servers.  I want streaming to be better supported, and then we would use it as a launching pad for HTTP 2 support. Regarding Ruby, I‚Äôm encouraged by the improvements in the garbage collector.  I think in the long run, the future of Ruby is associated with the addition of designs for working with concurrency, possibly with the built-in actor pattern. <br><br>  For Rails, I hope that we can improve the HTTP story in Ruby webservers.  If you want a launching pad for HTTP 2 support.  As far as Ruby is concerned, I am excited about Ruby's garbage collector.  I think it‚Äôs possible that the constructor can be, <br><br><br>  <b>What, in your opinion, is the most important problem that the Ruby and Ruby on Rails developers community is facing now?</b> <br><br>  In the future, for the Rails community, I think it will be very important to support HTTP 2, and it will not be easy.  We have a large number of programs that are dependent on HTTP 1.1, and I think it will be a daunting task to upgrade. <br><br>  It‚Äôs quite a challenge.  HTTP 1.1, This is a lot of software that depends on HTTP 1.1. <br><br>  <b>Is there a heme you could point your finger at and say: ‚ÄúThat's the way to write code‚Äù?</b> <br><br>  I think <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.0/libdoc/minitest/rdoc/MiniTest.html">minitest</a> is a good example.  It is small and easy to understand.  But I must say, not a single gem is perfect.  Everywhere there are problems, you can simply not see them yet! <br><br>  I think minitest is a good example.  It's small and easy to understand.  But I have to say that no gem is perfect.  It doesn‚Äôt have any problems! <br><br><br>  <b>What rules would you suggest to establish for the successful development of a Ruby project with 250+ thousand lines of code by many developers with very different skill levels?</b> <br><br>  I think the best rule I can offer is good communication within the team.  In addition, adhere to the principles of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design)">SOLID</a> .  I think these are good rules for newbies, and when you gain experience, you will begin to understand when you can break them. <br><br>  I guess it‚Äôs a good rule.  Other than that, stick to the SOLID design principles.  It is a good idea to understand those rules. <br><br>  <b>Is there any chance that in the foreseeable future MRI will get rid of GIL?</b> <br><br>  Perhaps not in the near future.  But I really think it will happen. <br><br>  Probably not in the near future. <br><br>  <b>Do you read any blog dedicated to Ruby / RoR?</b> <br><br>  I usually read ruby ‚Äã‚Äãsubreddit.  I also enjoy listening to the Giant Robots podcast, although they don‚Äôt often talk about giant robots. <br><br>  I usually read the ruby ‚Äã‚Äãsubreddit.  Also I like listening to the Giant Robots podcast, but very often. <br><br>  <b>What do you like to do when you don't write code?</b> <br><br>  Mostly cooking and video games.  Although more cooking.  Right now I'm salting bacon with my own hands! <br><br>  Most cooking and playing video games.  Mostly cooking though.  I am curing my own bacon right now! <br><br>  <b>Thanks for the interview and see you in Moscow!</b> <br><br>  All the questions that we did not ask, you can ask Aaron and our other participants personally - September 27, at the Digital October center.
