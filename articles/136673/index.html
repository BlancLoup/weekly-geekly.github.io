  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Pinpoint - the evolution or lessons of quick sharing</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  We have become accustomed to the fact that the Internet and mobile devices reduce time costs and make our lives easier: they allow you to store and instantly find the necessary data, keeping them ‚Äúat hand‚Äù, sharing it with friends and colleagues.  Therefore, the emergence of various online services that offer all the best and faster ways to share personal information is a natural evolutionary process.  And there is no limit to perfection! <br>  I have been working for a year in the Pinpoint project team.  And we managed to make a convenient and reasonable service for a quick ‚Äúsharing‚Äù and not only. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ef1/7ea/d66/ef17ead66788327c77127b8882cc7420.png"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  What is Pinpoint ( <a href="http://pin.pn/">http://pin.pn</a> )? </h4><br>  I will try to answer this question again, because a few months ago I already had a detailed <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/startup/127030/">article</a> where I described the portal part of the project, and most importantly for what and why we are doing this service.  If you suddenly forgot or did not read my post, then I‚Äôll repeat and start with the standard description of the project with which we presented the project at European start-ups (who cares, this is our <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/pinpn/pinpoint-pitch-presentation-dec-2011">last presentation from Seedcamp Paris 2011</a> ): Pinpoint is a public Internet project, thanks to which in one or two clicks you can mark an important place for you personally on the map and at the same time share with friends or colleagues.  This time. <br>  Two.  This is an online service that allows you to bind almost any type of information to a point on the map: for example, a photo to a location, comments about an event to a place where it has already taken place or will soon happen. <br>  And three.  This is a single database in which it is easy to find, store, organize personal and public data about places and events marked on the map. <br>  Everything is quite simple as you can see, but on the other hand, there‚Äôs nothing to be wise, because the bulk of our daily activities also consist of simple and ordinary things. <br>  Who is it useful?

    <h5>  IMHO - many of us! </h5><br>  I think that almost everyone is familiar with the situation when it is necessary to very quickly transfer information about the location: to tell where the meeting will take place and how best to get, reach, fly?  Pinpoint allows you to mark and share a point on the map in 1-2 mouse clicks. <br><br><h5>  Realtors and retailers! </h5><br>  It is easy to place and store business objects on the map, organize and sort by subject, send the conditions, offers and photos of the object to the client in one link. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2e4/234/393/2e4234393facf4e6bc953787e8c6cd09.png"><br><br><h5>  Architects and photographers! </h5><br>  Conveniently, when a professional portfolio is always at hand.  It is enough to place the projects and locations on the map, attach photos or pictures to them, come up with short convenient names for links (URL) to project folders (sets).  Perhaps new customers will find you themselves - by tags, by recommendations, <br>  Everybody  Any information that a user places on the server can be assigned to one of three levels of privacy: public, private, secret (only a link to a point that is not displayed for the whole service) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4c5/8b6/dba/4c58b6dbac27709ef3c6dfa858e1bf4d.png"><br><br><h4>  How to work with the service? </h4><br>  Everything is simple here.  And it was strange if it were otherwise for public service.  Registration, as it should be, takes a few seconds, and you immediately get down to work. <br><br>  First, a convenient, understandable and familiar Flickr interface. <br>  The scheme of work is elementary, with a maximum of three steps: <br><ol><li>  Created a point (mark on the map or enter the address), </li><li>  Added a description and pictures, add tags and select the level of privacy. </li><li>  I saved it and if I wanted to share my pins with whom you consider necessary.  (and in fact it is possible to ‚Äúdrag off‚Äù interesting pins of other users, but these are already additional options of this step). </li></ol><br>  Secondly, iPhone owners can already put dots and instantly share them literally ‚Äúon the run‚Äù - you just need to download the free (and very beautiful!) Application from the App Store ( <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/pinpoint.gs/id481990806">http://itunes.apple.com/app/pinpoint.gs / id481990806</a> ). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/538/bc0/987/538bc09879b0ed8b22d816dcaec64024.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/681/c2a/3df/681c2a3df3367c1ba3cb04db825cc858.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f27/38b/e98/f2738be980134b49e7612c80e909d838.jpg"><br><br>  Thirdly, it is time to learn how to share personal events, being tied to a geographical point.  This eliminates the need for a long and painful explanation of the meeting place, remembering the recommendations of the best friend and a flock of colleagues about what to see / where to eat / to knock on a long-awaited vacation in Morocco, in the Seychelles, in Madrid ....  No, so long vacation is rare.  In the end, we once learned to upload photos and music to specialized services? <br><br>  And finally, the most important thing - in Pinpoint, it‚Äôs really enough 1-2 clicks to mark a point and share with friends directly via a short link, or through Facebook or Twitter.  Faster way yet. <br><br>  From a technical point of view, Pinpoint is a platform for storing and organizing geodata and related information.  The Web is just one of the possible interfaces for interacting with the service.  The existing iphone application using the Pinpoint API allows you to fully use the service in any place, wherever you are, which is very important for geolocation services.  The API allows you to embed Pinpoint functionality (primarily the sharing of geo-data) into other applications and create new services based on their combination.  For example, using our API, you can embed an incident search function in your area or city, and there are a lot of similar applications in the news site.  Development of the platform and the addition of new features (maybe even not presented on the site) is a priority for us. <br><br>  Pinpoint ( <a href="http://pin.pn/">http://pin.pn</a> ) is not a map service, and therefore not a replacement for Yandex, Bing and Google.  Pinpoint makes it easier and more efficient than anyone to organize work with maps, points and information.  Should we compare specialized cartographic services and personal ‚Äúplace manager‚Äù?  It is better to look and check, than to ask questions. <br><br>  If anyone has anything to say, so we will always welcome - open to any discussions and discussions.  Any opinion from the side is very important for us, because we want everyone to find in Pinpoint what he needs. <br><br>  Ps.  Who needs it, but I like the project that our team is working on! <br>  Pss.
