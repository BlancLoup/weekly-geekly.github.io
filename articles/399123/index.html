  <section class="page js-page"><h1>MATRIX PowerWatch: smart watches that do not need to be charged</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a89/074/b25/a89074b25a8cd73e46d5073c783c092b.jpg"></div><br>  Smart gadgets are now on the market more than ever.  The same smart watches are made not only by well-known companies, but also by various kinds of non-manufacturers from China and other countries.  Therefore, all those companies who want to enter the market of smart wearable gadgets have to come up with something new, something that distinguishes their devices from those already on the market. <br><br>  MATRIX PowerWatch is just such a new idea.  This is a device that does not need to be charged.  It receives energy on its own, ‚Äúfeeding on‚Äù the warmth of the human body.  Hours - the mass of all functions, including measuring the level of calories burned, tracking activity levels, monitoring sleep quality.  In addition, there is one more function that no other smart device has anymore - the measurement of the amount of energy produced by the body of the owner. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/77f/b24/6a9/77fb246a9f397023eaae59082a21aa01.gif"><br><br>  The developers say that the watches work "forever" when they are worn on the wrist.  If they are removed, the device ‚Äúfalls asleep‚Äù, and all data remains stored in the main memory of the device.  And the device collects a lot of data.  According to the authors of the project, the calculation of calories and the collection of other data hours spend exactly.  The same calories are calculated in the original way - the device tracks the dynamics of various indicators using thermoelectricity.

      According to the <a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/view-from-the-valley/consumer-electronics/gadgets/this-smart-watch-will-charge-itself-using-the-heat-of-your-skin">initiators of the project</a> , humanity thoughtlessly disperses thermal energy, although it can be used for good.  Industrial enterprises disperse heat into the atmosphere, which no one collects.  The problem with the industry can not be solved yet, but a person can recycle their own thermal energy.  What is called - a trifle, but nice. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016/11/14/matrix-powerwatch-hands-on/">The case of the device is</a> made of aviation aluminum, so that the watch is resistant to external factors, such as strikes or falls.  Inside - wireless communication modules that allow the owner to synchronize clock data with a mobile device or devices.  The clock is not afraid of water, in them, as you can understand, you can even swim. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/144/a38/6bf/144a386bfd4fa50964f7b2d04b3a1964.gif"><br><br>  Pressing the physical button allows you to start one of the applications, for example, a stopwatch.  The dial of the device can be changed - for this, the developers have created several examples.  Third-party developers can offer their options. <br><br>  The watch is compatible with Android and iOS.  All indicators are analyzed and sent to a mobile application, where the dynamics of various processes for a week or a month are recorded.  User can glance record numbers.  Plus, the software platform of the device supports Apple Healthkit or Google Fit.  Information can be sent to your friends, acquaintances or colleagues to participate in competitions - for example, keep track of who will burn the most calories in a week. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4b1/547/d27/4b1547d272b9d62ee020d6f7ca029f97.jpg"><br><br>  The thermoelectric element is made of a ceramic substrate, a conductor layer (P / N), a layer of conductive metal.  Actually, everything is standard here.  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A2%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D1%258D%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE">Thermoelectricity</a> itself is a combination of phenomena in which the temperature difference creates an electric potential, or the electric potential creates a temperature difference. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/93f/b32/f5b/93fb32f5bc185f85edcd8058e384b220.png"><br><br>  Recently, thermoelectricity has been used more and more in devices such as portable refrigerators, beverage coolers, electronic unit coolers, metal alloy sorting devices, etc. One of the materials most commonly used in such devices is Bi2Te3 bismuth telluride, a chemical compound of bismuth and tellurium. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q-fVyZSZxIw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><h3>  What about the money? </h3><br>  Now developers are raising funds on the Indiegogo crowdfunding platform.  Already collected more than planned - $ 1,77585 instead of $ 100,000.  And until the end of the campaign - another 2 months.  So the project has every chance of becoming one of the most successful of all that has ever been published on Indiegogo.  Although, of course, to talk about it with confidence, you will have to wait 60 days. <br><br>  Now <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/smartwatch-powered-by-you-matrix-powerwatch-watch-fitness">pre-order</a> can be issued for $ 119 or $ 139.  After the start of sales, the device will cost about $ 160.  In the future, developers are planning to create other thermoelectric devices, including headphones, heart rate monitors and other gadgets. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/399123/">https://habr.com/ru/post/399123/</a></p>
