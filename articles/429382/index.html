In recent years, such solutions have been actively tested by many large Russian and foreign retailers.  We selected the five most interesting examples. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qo/ba/v1/qobav15aydfjov3i17xoittxrum.jpeg"><br><br>  Learn more about how to use facial recognition, neural networks, and machine learning in business, on the <a href="https://binarydistrict.com/ru/course/ai-school/%3Futm_source%3Dblogs%26utm_medium%3Dhabrhabr%26utm_campaign%3Dalibaba_x5retail">AI School</a> intensive course. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  1. Alibaba: payment using "smiles" in stores and check-in in hotels </h2><br>  KFC, along with Ant Financial (Alibaba‚Äôs ‚Äúdaughter‚Äù), launched Smile to Pay service - a smile-based payment at its restaurant in Hangzhou in 2017.  The head of the Alibaba Group, Jack Ma, first introduced him in 2015 at the CEBIT trade show in Hannover, but it came to stores only two years later.

      <b>How it works:</b> To buy a burger, you must enter the phone number tied to your Alipay wallet and smile at the camera embedded in the special biometric terminal.  After that, the system confirms the identity of the owner of the wallet and allows you to make a payment. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f-NIAUhU2E0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <i>Video from the official account of Alibaba Group on YouTube.</i> <br><br>  A smile is needed for the system to understand that it is a living person, and not a photograph.  Two or three seconds is enough for recognition.  It is impossible to deceive the system, even by changing the hair color, makeup or wearing a wig: it uses a complex of distinctive features, taking into account both the geometry of the face, and the location of certain points on it. <br><br>  In July 2018, they also <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/11/reuters-america-check-in-with-a-smile-marriott-alibaba-trial-facial-recognition-at-china-hotels.html">started testing</a> technology in two Marriott hotels - in Hangzhou and in Sanya County on Hainan Island.  Waiting at the reception desk is no longer necessary: ‚Äã‚Äãguests of the hotels for registration are photographed and enter contact details in the self-service terminal.  After that, the terminal checks the information with the reservation number and prints the key card to enter the room.  Registration time was reduced three times and takes only a minute (earlier - three). <br><br><h2>  2. Walmart: search for "unhappy" customers in stores </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kp/u6/ib/kpu6ib2e5_-hqxntyb_tnrdqhlk.jpeg"><br>  <i>Source: <a href="https://corporate.walmart.com/">Walmart official website</a></i> <br><br>  The world's largest retailer in 2017 has <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/walmart-is-developing-a-robot-that-identifies-unhappy-shoppers-2017-7">developed a</a> technology that helps determine how satisfied a customer is with visiting a store. <br><br>  <b>How it works:</b> if the system finds a buyer with an unhappy face, it should signal the store employees.  According to Walmart management, this will help improve customer service before they complain massively about any problems. <br><br>  In addition, the system should help analyze purchasing behavior over longer periods - for this, it will connect their emotions with how much they spend and what they buy.  The client‚Äôs biometric data is matched with the data of his transactions to detect changes in consumer habits due to dissatisfaction. <br><br>  Earlier, in 2015, Walmart had already tried to introduce a face recognition system - to prevent theft in stores - but the experiment eventually <a href="http://fortune.com/2015/11/09/wal-mart-facial-recognition/">failed</a> .  The system was considered unprofitable, how many thieves could be detected with its help, Walmart management did not report. <br><br><h2>  3. X5 Retail Group: the fight with queues at the box office </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/an/vk/lt/anvkltlgf9ufdlmp5youh810v_w.jpeg"><br><br>  The largest Russian retailer - X5 (Pyaterochka, Karusel, and Perekrestok) - also began testing face recognition technology in 2017.  According to the company's representatives, the technology <a href="https://www.vedomosti.ru/technology/articles/2017/09/07/732744-tehnologiya-raspoznavaniya-litsa">should</a> , in particular, help reduce waiting in queues at the box office and optimize the retail space. <br><br>  <b>How it works:</b> remember the signs at the checkout - ‚ÄúIf there are more than five people in the queue, call the number ...‚Äù?  The facial recognition system does the same thing automatically: if the queues of more than five customers, and some of the store‚Äôs cash desks do not work, the director receives an alert: ‚ÄúWe need to open a cashier.‚Äù  And with the help of video analytics, you can find out where more people go to the store, what they pay attention to, in order to properly position the goods and promotional materials. <br><br>  At the same time, facial recognition systems do not store photos, <a href="https://www.retail.ru/interviews/147494/">explained</a> Vasily Gromov, director of information technology at the Karusel retail chain (part of the X5 Retail Group).  The system builds a function that determines the location of points on the face - cheekbones, eyes, ears, and so on (face hash).  The next time, getting in the field of view of the cameras connected to the module for recognition, the system checks the image with the hash directory and gives a signal about who is in the video.  Vasily Gromov also pointed out that ‚Äúfrom the point of view of the law, a person‚Äôs hash is not personal information, since it does not allow identifying a person without additional information‚Äù.  In the official X5 blog on Habr√©, the company recently <a href="https://habr.com/article/426221/">wrote</a> that it continues to compare technologies for recognizing faces from different companies. <br><br><h2>  4. "Dixie": women - cosmetics, men - beer </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/2v/w6/ys/2vw6yslyviodp4zdljnl17_-tf8.png"><br>  <i>Source: official site AddReality</i> <br>  In Dixie, they decided to try face recognition technology at the same time as the X5 Retail Group, but chose another developer, AddReality.  The goal was to determine the sex and age of customers and implement targeted advertising in the cashier zone and in the sales area.  Dixy began testing biometric identification at Victoria stores and its headquarters in 2017. <br><br>  <b>How it works:</b> On large screens installed in sales areas, a camera is mounted to recognize the face of a person who, passing by, draws attention to the screen. <br><br><div class="oembed"><div><div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"><video controls="" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;">  Your browser does not support HTML5 video. <source src="https://addreality.com/user/pages/01.index/02._tabs/Shop_01.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></div></div></div><br>  ‚ÄúIt is possible to determine whether a man is a woman or a woman, an approximate age, and taking into account these parameters, based on the existing pool of advertisers, the most appropriate advertisement is broadcast on the monitor.

Yandex: special advertising for "bearded men" and intellectuals in pharmacies </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rk/nk/dc/rknkdc_ixpix1fbvwniwlwjtfie.jpeg"><br>  <i>Source: Yandex</i> <br><br>  Yandex in June 2018 <a href="https://retailer.ru/jandeks-nachal-raspoznavat-lica-posetitelej-aptek-asna-i-targetirovat-na-nih-reklamu/">launched the</a> sale of targeted advertising on screens using the face recognition system in Asna pharmacies.  At the core is the same technology that has already been used in Victoria stores, supplemented by the ability to select the most appropriate advertising for the user using a search engine. <br><br>  <b>How it works: the</b> system consists of a screen and a camera that recognizes the viewer: his age, gender, appearance features - for example, glasses or a beard, and other characteristics.  After that, with the help of Yandex.Direct, the most appropriate advertising for such a client is displayed on the screen. <br><br>  According to a Yandex representative, the system can independently determine the types of several people in front of the screen, and the advertiser will pay only for targeted impressions.  If there are three people in front of the screen, only two of which are advertisements relevant, the system will count two impressions. <br><br>  In Addreality, it was noted that the system ‚Äúuses only impersonal user data, does not identify individual customers, does not use personal data, and does not record video of customers passing by.‚Äù  The experiment began with 70 screens, another 2000 will appear in Asna pharmacies in case of successful testing of the system. <br><br>  Learn more about how to use facial recognition, neural networks, and machine learning in business, on the <a href="https://binarydistrict.com/ru/course/ai-school/%3Futm_source%3Dblogs%26utm_medium%3Dhabrhabr%26utm_campaign%3Dalibaba_x5retail">AI School</a> intensive course.
