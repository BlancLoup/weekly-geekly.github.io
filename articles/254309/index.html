In the post a blitz-review of books that will be useful for IT-specialists, businessmen and those who just love to read interesting technical things.  Next to each - an explanation of what it might be needed.  This review, unlike other annual, more technical and applied. <br><br>  Let's start with Woodson and Conover <b>'s Engineering Psychology Reference Book</b> . 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

      <br>
    <h4>  "Handbook of engineering psychology" - Woodson, Conover </h4><br>  The book is about what are the buttons and levers, how people click on them.  And how to design so that people work with the system effectively.  I am glad that he considers the user as a basic input-output system, measuring its average information transfer rate (about 20 bits per second to the button interfaces), input and output speeds. <a name="habracut"></a>  Just after such books it becomes clear from where in science fiction on ships of the thirtieth century there are notifications about fire in the form of a specially created burning smell, and about a hit - by a specially created vibration. <br><br><h4>  "Design of familiar things" - DA  Norman </h4><br>  This is a good old book about why the kettle looks like this and not otherwise.  Actually, if you liked the topic about the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/mosigra/blog/251465/">interfaces in the real world</a> - immediately and without thinking, download Norman.  There are much more detailed and in-depth analyzes of conventional interfaces with theory. <br><br><h4>  "User Interface Design" - V. Golovach </h4><br>  A very old book (2001-2003), which is surprisingly good about design and generally the basics of usability.  I recommend to read it without fail.  The only moment - the author, suddenly, wrote a second book with the same title, and she is more about GTD and all sorts of side effects.  Therefore, it is extremely important to find the first part. <br><br><h4>  ‚ÄúThe language of things‚Äù - Dejan Sudjic </h4><br>  A small paper book, which could not be downloaded, had to walk to the store.  An amazingly good thing that can be read both by artists and developers.  Answers many questions in a historical context, shows the evolution of things from ‚Äúmade forever‚Äù to ‚Äúmade to break down in half a year‚Äù. <br><br><h4>  ‚ÄúThe Art of Deception‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe Art of Invasion‚Äù - K. Mitnick </h4><br>  Two classic things about social engineering, useful to everyone without exception.  But requiring real IT education to understand what is happening.  Stories from insanely beautiful hacks to theft of a gaming machine for reverse engineering firmware (more precisely, a random number generator in it), assembling a device to exploit vulnerabilities and implement in a casino.  Of course, read.  You can even like a series of stories, if you want to take on the road something interesting. <br><br><h4>  "Believe me, I'm lying" - Ryan Holiday </h4><br>  The author suddenly discovered iterative journalism on social networks for himself and was very scared of this.  Actually, the mechanics are briefly this: for money, publish an article in a small cheap rag about what you wanted to invent a subluminal engine, relying on it as a source, doing a Wikipedia article about superlight engines and your company.  Then go to the media level up or do a post on Habr under the heading "Superlight engine in 2017?", Where at the end, far, far away, say that it is possible, but most likely not.  And so on until Kommersant writes about you.  Or you can write from the left post about the installation of the ‚ÄúEye of Sauron‚Äù addressed to some religious person, explaining, asking how he can look at it in silence.  And get megaholivar the entire Runet.  In general, enjoy an educational program for trolling journalists. <br><br><h4>  "What happens In Vegas Stays on Youtube" by Erik Qualman </h4><br>  The only book in the assembly in English, but written in a fairly simple language.  It helps to master basic things by the way social networks suddenly change the world;  plus, which is important, it contains quite effective safety measures for social networks for ordinary users, parents and employees of public companies.  For example, a child leaves a ‚Äúdigital footprint‚Äù before birth - by the time he actually begins to live about him, he will already be under a hundred posts. <br><br><h4>  "Contagious" - Yona Berger </h4><br>  Surprisingly sound book about the word of mouth (read: social networks) after all the marketing sludge that is sold to the masses.  You just need to read and rejoice at how effectively you can do many things.  For example, the bar "Do not tell anyone about us" - from the street looks like a regular igalovka, but if you go inside and type the password on the phone, a piece of the wall will open and you will go to a secret bar.  Tables there booked a month in advance. <br><br><h4>  "45 manager tattoos" - M. Batyryov </h4><br>  Judging by the title and photos of the author on the cover, this book is not even worth opening.  But the first impression is very deceptive.  Inside - good life useful stories from the Russian reality from Batyryov from Consultant Plus.  I strongly advise all team leaders and those who lead their project.  A robust and unobtrusive, very, very non-American format with a chew of one thought. <br><br><h4>  ‚ÄúLife and Work Abroad‚Äù - S. Sander </h4><br>  An old book describing the correct process of driving a tractor.  However, it is worth reading it if you are just soaping somewhere to go.  And even if not, it is useful, plus it destroys several stereotypes. <br><br><h4>  "Magic Pixar" - David Price </h4><br>  Pixar is the former company of a certain S. Jobs.  Surprisingly interesting from a technological point of view, it can be considered as the history of 3D graphics.  In general, such a nice long post about renderings, cartoons and business. <br><br><h4>  ‚ÄúHow great ones perish, and why some companies never give up‚Äù - D. Collins </h4><br>  This is the good old Collins, who started with ‚ÄúGood to Great‚Äù and continued with a couple of books.  Every fact with proof, every word is weighed, the conclusions are interesting.  In general, yes, of course, read. <br><br><h4>  ‚ÄúPour Your Heart into It‚Äù - Howard Schultz </h4><br>  How Starbucks appeared, how he grew up, how he experienced crises and in general a lot of useful things.  A good tale about a socially-oriented company with a bunch of interesting facts. <br><br><h4>  "Doom Lords" - David Kushner </h4><br>  The semi-humanitarian book, where a good technological history and hardcore GameDev can be traced behind the attempts to tell the story of id.  I remind you that the engine in question in the book is in the public domain, and its later version has even been repeatedly reviewed here (here‚Äôs one of the best <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/166113/">posts</a> about the beauty of this code).  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/lesnikova/" class="user_link">lesnikova</a> donated this book to a child with ‚ÄúProdlnki‚Äù without reading, and then found there a fragment about the fascists from Wolfenstein, where Romero wanted the main character's hits to be restored when jumping through their guts on the floor.  It was a little embarrassing. <br><br><h4>  ‚ÄúThe Pearls of Programming‚Äù by Bentley </h4><br>  I do not know how I went around this book in previous reviews, but time to catch up.  I recently stumbled upon it while parsing my paper library and was wildly happy.  If you have not read - be sure to take the updated edition.  This is the good old hardcore, which does not cause anything but delight.  The book is ancient, but not outdated. <br><br><h3>  More books </h3><br>  Actually, as usual, I ask you to advise good books in the comments and write a few words, why you should read each and what's inside.  Just please, first look at similar posts in <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/mosigra/blog/110797/">2010</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/mosigra/blog/141804/">2012</a> and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/mosigra/blog/178557/">2013</a> , so as not to repeat.  Most of the books above and in these posts can be <abbr title="Yes, if suddenly you do not download books directly through Flibusta, do not forget about its patched darknet version.">found</abbr> in RuNet. <br><br>  And as usual - please do not add the post to your favorites, but immediately look for books. <br><br>  <b>Well, we need some of your help.</b>  If you came across good books about starting a business abroad and all the small projects around the ‚ÄúCultural Code‚Äù type or so on, we would really like to have knowledge about the USA and Germany in ecommerce and retail.  In any language. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/254309/">https://habr.com/ru/post/254309/</a></p>
