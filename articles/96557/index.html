  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Opened a paid web service, and what's next? Psychoanalysis for a startup</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Questions will be at the end of the post, but first a bit of a messy story. <br><br>  How many I have already tried ideas and projects, how many lines of code have been written and corrupted human nerves, how many hopes have been destroyed, but the soul doesn‚Äôt calm down - Mark Zuckerberg‚Äôs fame does not let you sleep!  I am sure there are many of these among you, you will probably understand me.  I wrote about a part of my projects in Habr√©, all went into oblivion for one reason or another.  Over the past 1.5 years, I have retrained from a stupid customer to an independent web developer, I have mastered programming myself and with grief in half, ‚Äúdesign‚Äù and now, like in an insane asylum: I made myself up, wrote it myself, I used it myself. <br><br>  So, in short: having lost the main source of income and significant savings, I suddenly found myself on Earth and realized that my dreams of opening a second facebook or Google are better postponed for now - the probability of shooting is small, and there are not enough resources.  And I decided to return to the good old method: <br><ul><li>  find a narrow area </li><li>  find weaknesses and problems in this area </li><li>  make a paid web service that solves these problems </li></ul><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  And what did I find?  I have a few friends who own popular photoblogs with non-unique content.  Content for these blogs is taken from other blogs that take this content from somewhere else.  Let me tell you America: in the blogosphere, the principle of ‚Äústeal the loot‚Äù often operates and everyone copies each other without any permissions.  Not a very ethical area?  I thought too late about whether my service will serve the Forces of Good, but, looking ahead, I will say that I am totally against copying content without the permission of the author, as reported to users.  Okay, I hope you forgave me - go ahead.  So what's the problem with these bloggers?  Many people copy pictures with their hands, and who are more advanced, use programs for parsing pictures, download them to themselves, upload them to the server, create a post with links to pictures.  There are also very expensive and obscure plugins for WordPress, which do not exactly what you need.  In general, I took and made a service that allows you to: <br><ul><li>  Parse pictures from any page and display as a gallery (you can delete extra pictures) </li><li>  allow you to download pictures in one archive to yourself or upload to the server via FTP / SFTP </li><li>  automatically generate, edit and upload a post with pictures to your hosting with WordPress (you must first upload them there via FTP / SFTP in the previous step) </li></ul><br>  Actually the service itself <a href="https://smallninja.com/">smallninja.com</a>

      And it looks something like this: <br>  ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/pupsor/" class="user_link">By the</a> way, thanks to a friend <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/pupsor/" class="user_link">pupsor</a> for a free-provided account on vimeo) <br><br><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/12103175&amp;xid=17259,1500002,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhiq330NjjU3cHt4Oac_RBM4O26OtA" width="504" height="315" frameborder="0" title="How to grab images from anywhere" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Next, I screwed Paypal, made a test free period and ... and sat down.  What's next?  How to search for clients?  How to promote?  And here I realized that every time I encountered the same problem: having implemented the project in a certain minimum, I did not know how to attract people there, I did a couple of uncertain moves, and as a result I threw.  Therefore, this time I decided to fight a little longer.  Of course, users of Habr are not the target audience for this service, so I‚Äôm ready to give you the Acca for free.  Registration is now open and 100 free attempts are given by default.  If not enough - write in a personal, make premium. <br><br>  Now questions: <br><ol><li>  Does the idea have potential?  Is it possible to earn something by this service or should I start the next idea? </li><li>  Is it ethical or unethical to create such services? </li><li>  The question is only to the designers: is the design and the interface very ridiculous, or is it tolerable? </li><li>  What would you add / change in the interface, functions? </li></ol></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/96557/">https://habr.com/ru/post/96557/</a></p>
