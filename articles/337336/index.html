But I did not reveal one rather important point - the <b>name</b> .  In fact, a well-chosen name can play a significant role in attracting an audience. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  Introduction  Scientific problem statement </h1><br>  In general, the name is best come up when the project is nearing its end.  Although in most cases this is what happens. <br><br>  So, having decided to come up with a name for my game, I got into the Internet.  But there were <i>no</i> worthwhile articles. 
      <br>

      What to do? <br><br>  And then I decided to put the problem in a scientific way, <b>classify the</b> names of the games, find the best version of the names and come up with my own. <br><br>  So, here is my small classification.  I warn you that the choice of games for examples is just what came to mind, that's all, nobody should touch anyone's preferences. <br><br><h1>  Group Number One, or abstractionism lovers </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/3b9/384/105/3b938410524d4fcfb2a34e18bee05e42.jpg" width="600"><br><br><h2>  Internal Name Subgroup </h2><br>  Well, or how to call this whole thing? <br><br>  This group includes names that seem to really mean something, but the meaning is deciphered only <b>in the game itself</b> .  An example is the infamous Armikrog: from the name of the player can not endure anything, but in the game itself Armikrog is the name of the place where the game takes place. <br><br>  <b>Pros</b> : on request only this game will be displayed without third-party links to similar requests;  unique name that can stand out <br><br>  <b>Cons</b> : The original name is harder to remember and type correctly;  the player does not receive information about the essence of the game <br><br><h2>  Subgroup of true abstract names </h2><br>  A rare group of names that are a perfect abstraction and do not reveal the essence of the game, nor its internal content.  Example: <s>Rymdkapsel</s> (I was told here that it still means "spaceship" in Swedish). <br><br>  <b>Pros</b> : the same <br><br>  <b>Cons</b> : the same, but the name is not related to the game completely, which can completely knock a player <br><br><h1>  Group Number Two, or almost instruction </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/b1b/eeb/d09/b1beebd090cb41f391df4e1c1b91a9e5.jpg" width="600"><br><br>  This type of title gives direct <b>calls and directions</b> to the gameplay process.  Example: Cut the Rope (Russian. Cut the rope - during the game you have to cut the rope).  May give instructions not only to elementary gameplay, but also give instructions already on a more developed game process (Don't Starve), set rules (Move or Die) or point to a goal of the game (Build a Bridge) <br><br>  <b>Pros</b> : the player immediately understands what he will have to do in the game <br><br>  <b>Cons</b> : if the game is not very famous, it can be difficult to find <br><br><h1>  Group Number Three, or Personal Names ... again </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/8f9/b8d/325/8f9b8d325c4948a6baffe8d2421373bf.png" width="600"><br><br>  No, here we are talking about proper names, which can at least say something to the player, unlike abstractions. <br><br><h2>  Character Subgroup </h2><br>  Still, the name of the characters may hint at what the game will be about.  In fact, an ambal is unlikely to collect flowers, and a basketball ball usually doesn‚Äôt cut enemies with a katana (although fantasy can be unlimited).  If the title is some Ninja, you can immediately understand that the game is likely to need speed or agility. <br>  Example: Super Meat Boy.  The prefix "Super" hints at some special characteristics of this character, his heroism. <br><br>  <b>Pros</b> : the player will immediately be familiar with the character;  perhaps a character can tell something about the game <br>  <b>Minuses</b> : in comparison with the previous group, the information content is still lower <br><br><h2>  Environment Subgroup </h2><br>  The names are more general in nature, they explain the atmosphere, the world, that is, the <b>setting of the</b> game as a whole.  Example: Knock-knock (Rus. Knock-knock-knock, shows that the player will obviously have to deal with someone who comes).  A bit of another variety: Limbo (well, here is a hint of a <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259B%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B1_(%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F)">limb</a> ) <br><br>  <b>Pros</b> : reveals the environment in which the player will play <br>  <b>Cons</b> : again, it can merge with related requests, it does not always clearly indicate how to interpret the name <br><br><h2>  Subgroup abbreviations </h2><br>  Sometimes even abbreviations are used, which are usually deciphered later.  Examples: CATS, STALKER <br><br>  <b>Pros</b> : Abbreviations attract attention and intrigue people, decoding can reveal more the essence <br>  <b>Cons</b> : It can be difficult to match the words to an abbreviation;  There may be a problem with finding the name. <br><br><h1>  Group Number Four, or Mix </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/742/9df/6fb/7429df6fb45b437bb0aa886b8669090c.jpg" width="600"><br><br>  And in fact, merging words to form new names is a fairly good practice.  At the same time, the result, although <b>unique</b> , can tell something. <br>  Example: The Neverhood <br>  You can <i>change the</i> usual words, but so that the search engine does not correct: Scribblenauts <br><br>  <b>Pros</b> : the name is unique, the player understands the essence <br>  <b>Cons</b> : The name can be very complicated.  and the search engine automatically correct <br><br><h1>  Afterword </h1><br>  What did I choose?  I chose Group Number Four and decided to name my project in such a way that the decor was introduced and the plot was revealed, in which one of the key points in future updates would be the absence of the sun.  Specifically - <b>Nullysun</b> , that is, "Zero Sun" or something like that.  <s>I would not openly say the result</s> if it were not for one important mistake that I did not take into account: <br><br>  The players remembered the name well, but with the <b>writing it</b> was just a disaster - they often wrote Nullisun instead of Nullysun.  What does this mean?  Try, if the name is original, avoid letters such as Y, W, beware of combinations of U / OO, C / K, KS / X, etc. This is especially true of those who count, including or mainly on the Russian audience. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/337336/">https://habr.com/ru/post/337336/</a></p>
