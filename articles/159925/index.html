When is it profitable?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Based on the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/159833/">topic of light bulbs</a> .  Since I can not answer there, I will write this post. <br>  Not everyone understands the essence of the fluorescent lamp, so some people associate them with a divorce on ‚Äúnanotechnology‚Äù, while others associate them with joy and joy for years.  So what's the matter, where are the stated 8000 hours, and is the calculation of savings true? <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f8a/9e7/104/f8a9e71047451ab8f4b6e729d62c8eb4.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  Let's start the calculation: </h5><br>  The first thing you should pay attention to is that the claimed equivalents, those that are written on the box, are something theoretical and little connected with reality.  We do not take incomprehensible Chinese, there can be anything.  They made measurements for osram and navigator - they are sold everywhere, like quality ones.  Measurements with a luxmeter showed that the illumination from fluorescent lamps is 2.5-3 times higher (not 5 ... 6 times) than from ordinary incandescent lamps.  Those that do not take whites at all are impossible to use in everyday life (the ratio was 3.5). <br><br>  Total we get that in order to replace a 60 watt bulb, we need not 15 W saving, but something closer to 25 if we want to get a yellow light.  Can I take white and save?  Here the problem is in the perception of the eye - colors and volumes are better recognized in the yellowish light, so you will still want more light.  The above is true for residential premises, white light is applicable to illuminate the planes and free spaces, but we want to illuminate the home. <br><br>  Total in the calculation from the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/159833/">article</a> we have been getting for 6-8 months, which is good, but not so super-economical as we would like.

    <h5>  Where are the stated 8000 (and sometimes 12000) hours? </h5><br>  What is simplistic advertising says: saving lamps do not have a filament, so there is nothing to burn out ... and they do not lie, but this is true while the lamp is on. <br><br>  What happens when the saving light comes on: The electronic part of the light bulb generates a high voltage pulse, which is fed to the filament, which warms up, which helps the gas to penetrate the pulse.  After that, the lamp is lit in normal mode. <br><br>  Here lies the non-saying: here, too, there are threads that have a limited resource (compared to the almost ‚Äúendless‚Äù resource of a tube with current-carrying areas).  That is, the resource rests not during operation, but against the number of inclusions, while with an ordinary light bulb the life of an incandescent filament weakly depends on on-off cycles.  <b>In fact, it turns out that we are comparing time with pieces.</b> <br><br>  Therefore, a constantly burning lamp saves, and the lamp in the toilet spends our money and is unprofitable, because it does not burn for long, and it will work out its resource quickly, and here it‚Äôs not the manufacturer and quality of the lamp. <br><br><h5>  Breakdown: </h5><br>  What usually breaks down in saving lamps and what can be done: <br>  1. Condenser breakdown occurs most often.  Especially with this, the Chinese are sinning, who put it very close to the design loads and any voltage surge breaks through it, now almost all the bulbs that they saw are already equipped with a normal capacitor, so the Chinese have corrected.  But we still have strong jumps in networks. <br>  2. Fuse.  All the same power surges during lamp operation.  Usually there is not a fuse, but a resistor with a small resistance that burns out. <br>  3. Burns the filament.  And on one thread (there are two of them in the lamp - on each side of the tube) the lamp works fine, you only need to solder a suitable resistor instead of a burnt thread.  (Remember that there is a large voltage, which may persist in the capacitor after de-energizing !!!) <br><br>  The first two failures come from the imperfection of the network (and because of this, someone has light bulbs live for years, and someone has a pair of flies every month).  The solution is to put a stabilizer at the entrance to the apartment.  Issue price of about 10-15000.  Here you protect yourself from electricians, and the lightning hits the wires and the outlet will be 220, not 250 (which happens).  I strongly recommend if there is a place to put it.  Life story: at the dacha we have a stabilizer, a lightning hit the pole next to it - we have no problems, our neighbors have to replace all the wiring, and they are also lucky that they did not catch fire - all the wires melted. <br><br>  The basic rule, which should be guided by using fluorescent lamps - if the light is turned off for less than an hour, then it is more profitable to leave it on (for the older generation it seems just awful).  And it is not recommended to turn off the lamp for less than 5 minutes of work - it does not have time to warm up and the risk of breakage increases. <br><br>  Manufacturers are forced to make sealed enclosures so that those who hang the lamp in the bathroom are not shattered by the current.  But this is also the reason for the fragility - the thermal conditions of operation of radio components are not observed, the circuit heats up and the developers have to choose between the reliability of the elements and the cost (and we don‚Äôt want to buy lamps for 600r - we need 150 maximum), so if the year works well and good <br><br><h5>  And what about the LEDs? </h5><br>  Well, let's talk a little about LED lamps: They do not burn out, they have declared 25,000 and more hours of work.  It would seem ideal.  But (as always there is) overheating and consistency of power supply is very critical for them, therefore there should be radiators, stabilization boards.  And here the main problem is in heating - there is no problem to get super light, but now that the LED inside does not overheat is difficult to provide, and therefore also compromise.  LEDs gradually dim during operation.  It can not burn out, does not change the brightness dramatically, but after a couple of years it will seem that "you need more light."  As a backlight, weak diodes are ideal and eternal, but strong LEDs have not yet received a technological solution to the problem of attenuation from self-heating. <br><br>  There was a discussion about street lights with LEDs - they put one in the yard - the price is 15,000, it shines white (and there are no yellowish modifications).  Visually, a little rain / fog a little is not visible, that is, as if it is light, but you need to peer - the rest of the lights have been decided not to change yet, they give an order of magnitude more pleasant light regardless of the weather, the technology clearly requires development. <br><br>  I actively use powerful LED lights when riding a bike - from experience after 3 years, the lantern needs to be changed, since the drop in brightness is noticeable compared to the new one.  But in this area there is no alternative - in terms of compactness and weight LEDs have no equal. <br><br><h5>  Findings: </h5><br>  It is necessary to determine the places where the light is on often and for a long time (corridor, kitchen) and hang up saving lights and do not turn them off until you go to sleep.  For night illumination, weak LEDs are perfectly suited, the consumption of which is so small that you can never turn them off.  If you need to often turn on and off the light, then we put either a normal or a powerful LED. <br><br>  All this is confirmed by personal experience.  I have a fluorescent lamp at the entrance, which is simply turned on and off by a timer - it is already 3 years old.  And while in the corridor they clicked the switch, the lamp did not live for two months, now it also hung up on the timer - it burns itself in the evening and everyone is happy. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/159925/">https://habr.com/ru/post/159925/</a></p>
