      <b>Current place of work:</b> <br>  For six years, this is Yandex.  I came here at the height of the crisis - in 2009, having decided to radically change the scope of activities.  The choice fell on the most dynamically growing industry - the Internet.  The decision which company to go to was obvious from the very beginning, because Yandex was always and remains close to me in spirit.  After three interviews, I got into the sales department.  A year later I was the manager with the biggest turnover, a year later I became the head of the group and a year later I headed the division.  It works with the 250 largest advertisers of various business segments - from FMCG to e-commerce. <br><br>  <b>One word that best describes how you work:</b> <br>  There is no such word (in fact, it is, but it is unprintable). <br><br>  <b>How many hours a day do you work?</b> <br>  Usually 9-10, but this does not include work at home and on weekends. <br><br>  <b>Current mobile device:</b> <br>  iphone <br><br>  <b>Current computer:</b> <br>  Macbook Air 13 " <br><br>  <b>Without any applications, programs, utilities you can not live?</b> <br>  My work is constant communication with the outside world, so Outlook and messengers are our everything. <br><br>  <b>Which life hack helps you save time?</b> <br>  Now there is a huge number of services and applications that help us save our time.  For example, with the help of Ya.Metro, Ya.Kart and Ya.Taksi, you can understand in a few seconds how to get from point A to point B. faster. You can shift your homework routine, which takes a lot of time, to Qlean and Youdo services.  The main hack - delegate everything that can be delegated, keep only the most important thing. <br><br>  <b>What kind of to-do manager do you use?</b> <br>  Outlook <br><br>  <b>What do you listen when you work?</b> <br>  Your selection of electronic music on SoundCloud: <a href="https://soundcloud.com/victor-yackovlev">https://soundcloud.com/victor-yackovlev</a> .  She is perfect. <br><br>  <b>What are you reading now?</b> <br>  I have a not very good habit of reading several books at a time.  Now it is Pavel Peppershtein‚Äôs ‚ÄúMyth's Love of Castes‚Äù, ‚ÄúAbout China‚Äù by Henry Kissinger and ‚ÄúAtlas Shrugged‚Äù Ayn Rand. <br><br>  <b>Which book from the last read was remembered the most?</b> <br>  "Atlas Shrugged".  She made an indelible impression on me as a real capitalist. <br><br>  <b>Do you use e-readers or prefer paper books?</b> <br>  I prefer paper, but I use purely electronic. <br><br>  <b>How long do you sleep?</b> <br>  Lately - with the advent of a small child - less than we would like.  But I try at least 7 hours. <br><br>  <b>Are you an owl or a lark?</b> <br>  Owl, which turned into a lark. <br><br>  <b>How do you have breakfast?</b> <br>  Usually my breakfast is a cup of coffee, on weekends - an English breakfast or variations on this topic. <br><br>  <b>How do you spend your time on the way to work / from work?</b> <br>  I read <br><br>  <b>What advice you have ever been given can you convey to others?</b> <br>  Defend your point of view and always do only what you think is right.  Every year, this advice is becoming more and more valuable to me. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/295718/">https://habr.com/ru/post/295718/</a></p>
