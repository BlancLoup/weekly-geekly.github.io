Judging by my friends, this is a fairly common phenomenon.  <a href="http://www.nd.edu/~memory/Reprints/Radvansky%2520Krawietz%2520%26amp%3B%2520Tamplin%25202011%2520(QJEP).pdf">A recent study</a> allows us to explain this phenomenon (it is called ‚ÄúRoomnesia‚Äù) and suggests ways to combat this problem or eliminate its consequences. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

They call such separate sections of memory "episodes of memories."  The authors of the study suggest that the simple action of passing through the door of a room creates a new episode of memories for a person, thereby reducing his ability to recall the details from the previous episode (as well as why he entered the room).  Interestingly, in two of the three experiments, psychologists tested the subjects in a virtual environment - in other words, a person does not even need to physically go through the door to experience the loss of an episode of memories. <br><br>  If new episodes of memories are created in this way, how does this affect the user's behavior on the site?  Should we avoid splitting a set of complex forms into multiple pages, forcing the user to go through them?  Should I collect all the most important thing on the main page?  Or constantly remind the user where he is and why? <br><br>  Usability expert Jakob Nielsen, in his article <a href="">Ten Usability Heurisctics,</a> warns that ‚Äúthe user should not remember information when moving from one part of the dialogue to another‚Äù.  This statement fits well with the theory of rooms - forcing the user to remember information, you increase the likelihood that the user may forget something and experience an unpleasant experience from working with the site. <br><br><h2>  Practical use </h2><br>  Taking into account this research, what actions we can take can increase user experience and help the user remember where they came from and why? <br><br>  In short, we have a large selection of solutions available.  For example, a significant part of my current job is to maintain the level of user involvement in the hotel booking process for the weekend.  And we started by trying to highlight as many reasons as possible for which users can interrupt the booking process: <br><ul><li>  users do not trust the site on which they are located; </li><li>  users are forced to register an account too early; </li><li>  the booking process seems to them too long; </li><li>  they consider the price too high; </li><li>  they leave in search of a discount code (and no longer return); </li><li>  and perhaps they forget how important the service or product they are going to buy. </li></ul><br>  Some of the key elements that we always display during the booking process are where the user is currently located and the details of the order (including its full cost).  Also, wherever possible, we try to remind you how important a product or service is to the user. <br><br>  Other possible actions that can make your site more memorable. <br><br>  <strong>Make sure that the page headers match the links that lead to them.</strong>  If the user clicks on "Order Details", make sure that they see enough detailed information about the order on the next page.  Similarly, make sure that your pay-per-click landing pages match the ads that your visitors click on.  Quite a lot of things can happen between clicking on a link and entering a page - make sure that it‚Äôs obvious to the user why he has reached this page. <br><br>  <strong>Speak the same language with the user.</strong>  Forcing a user to learn and memorize new terms and words is far from the best strategy.  Forcing to doubt and feel stupid user when he needs to memorize new words you create a negative experience in him from interacting with the site. <br><br>  <strong>Do not expect the user to memorize numbers or codes (articles, discount codes, voucher codes). The</strong> article may mean something to you, but definitely not to the user.  Never make him remember such information from one screen to another.  (comment of translator: many Russian online stores sin with too careful attitude of call center employees to articles and it is often impossible to place an order by phone if you don‚Äôt know the article number of the goods you want to order. If I want to place an order, I must the ability to do this in any way possible and know only the name of the product) <br><br>  <strong>Remind you what the user was looking for on the search result page.</strong>  This will not only allow the user to maintain an understanding of what is happening, but also to refine the query, if the initial query did not lead to the desired result. <br><br>  <strong>Encourage the user to return to the search results that users have carried out before,</strong> especially for e-commerce sites.  Search by product can be made by the user on many sites and for long periods of time.  Defining a user and showing him his previous search results, you remove from him the need to remember exactly what sequence of actions in the past led him to the desired result. <br><br><h2>  Expanding context memory </h2><br>  In the past, there were many ways to restore previous episodes of memories: stickers, calendars, diaries, etc.  Although many of these tried-and-true technologies have their digital versions, the software is out of touch with the real world.  However, with the proliferation of mobile technology, this distance is increasingly reduced.  For example, when Apple introduced the iOS5 update, their <a href="">promotional website</a> talked about the Reminders app (‚ÄúReminders‚Äù in the Russian version of iOS) as a tool for managing flashback episodes: <br><blockquote>  The next time you have the thought "Do not forget ...", just pull out your iOS device and add it to the Reminders application.  ... And with the help of geolocation service, you will receive a reminder as soon as you park the car at the shopping center. </blockquote><br>  Reminders is a great way to restore previous episodes of memories.  And if Apple further improves the accuracy of the geolocation service, you can receive reminders why you entered this particular room. <br><br>  Another application that promises to strengthen our memory is OmniFocus for iPhone.  Their "Maps" screen shows possible actions that are close to you.  "For example, if you need to buy groceries, OmniFocus can show you the nearest grocery store and create a shopping list." <br><br><h2>  Effects </h2><br>  Finally, it is worth discussing the use of this topic in an even greater context. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17470218.2011.571267">A recent study</a> shows that the Internet is becoming an external part of our memory.  This is what we call "a decrease in the level of knowledge of relevant information, but an increase in the level of knowledge about where this information can be found."  In other words, we may not remember the name of the director Memento, but we may know where to find this information.  It is much easier to remember a room (IMDb) than to remember all the actors and directors who inhabit our world.  By creating high-quality content, you make your site just such a room in which the user can always find relevant information. <br><br>  Should this study conclude that computers reduce our ability to remember?  This idea <a href="http://www.useit.com/papers/heuristic/heuristic_list.html">has been around for quite a long time</a> and there is some truth in it.  For example, when was the last time you memorized the phones of your friends or family members?  Knowing that this information is stored in the memory of my phone (or online) means that I do not need to make an effort to remember them.  It certainly does not cause any inconvenience, as long as I do not lose my phone or Internet access. <br><br>  Betsy Sparrow in his article in the magazine Wired <a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2011/07/is-google-ruining-your-memory/">Is google ruining your memory</a> concludes: "We are gradually becoming a symbiosis with computer tools, developing into interlaced systems that store less specific information, but know where this information can be found." <br><br>  Is it bad? <br><br>  Article author: <a href="http://www.uxbooth.com/author/timminor/">Tim Minor</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/146629/">https://habr.com/ru/post/146629/</a></p>
