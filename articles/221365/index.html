The problem with Nokia was that the company wasn‚Äôt able to rush into the Android camp with open arms.  Therefore, Nokia decided to outsmart everyone and make, on the basis of Android, its own interpretation of the platform, so to speak, with blackjack and other attributes.  And the price of the device, at first glance, is moderate - under 5,000 rubles (~ $ 138).  In order to better understand how the creation of the Finns turned out to be competitive, I took one of the typical new ‚Äústate employees‚Äù on Android and began to thoroughly compare the models.  What came of it - read under the cut. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bad/c6e/fb6/badc6efb6d18d4fc29d06a5ebf751481.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The Highscreen Zera F was chosen as a sparring partner. The model costs a thousand rubles less than the Nokia X, but at the same time it was announced as a budget solution of the 2014 model.  In particular, instead of the previously typical 512 MB of RAM, 1 GB was installed, and the TFT-TN screen was replaced with a more progressive IPS display.

    <h4>  Equipment </h4><br>  The dimensions of the Nokia X box immediately seem to say - they say, an inexpensive smartphone.  Behind on the package the information is presented so concisely, as if it was originally planned to place the model in an even more compact box.  And only at the last moment of development did not spare the cardboard, leaving a completely empty space with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã9.5 x 2.5 cm. Plus, I am more than confident that the knowledge of the average user in decoding resolutions is limited to HD and Full HD, whereas with an understanding of WVGA serious problems.  At Highscreen Zera F - recycled cardboard, all the basic characteristics on the front side, plus information about 32 GB of ‚Äúfreebies‚Äù in the 4Sync cloud, the latter is duplicated from behind. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ea6/dab/da7/ea6dabda7875b609f8f3548f913e41b6.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/94a/d8a/71a/94ad8a71a946ef2d6f1f55f89774d4f6.jpg"><br><br>  The Nokia X package bundle surprised me a bit - it's not that I test smartphones too often for about 5,000 rubles, but over the past year or two I don‚Äôt recall models without a microUSB cable in a box.  This is clearly not the penny accessory, which is worth saving. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e65/a13/036/e65a130367f69bdb6385e300aa4a86ff.jpg"><br><br>  In contrast to the Highscreen Zera F - not only there is a separate charging unit and "string", but in both cases there is a backlight.  Not the most important feature, but definitely bringing diversity to the world of black chargers and cables. <br><br>  The quality of the headsets in both models is somewhere at the level ‚Äúbelow the plinth‚Äù, however, I did not expect anything else.  However, I would be surprised once again - why do not bulk foam pads be applied to headphones of this kind for a long time?  For it is difficult for me to imagine an ear from which such a headset will not fall out.  And Highscreen Zera F, and Nokia X have something to flash.  At the first design, the iPhone headset is cleaned off, but the second has a bright red color in the asset. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/80c/59f/42f/80c59f42f684a0f826cc0ed73b35a48a.jpg"><br><br>  The victory is still for the "Giraffe", it has a button to call and control the player. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/346/169/fd8/346169fd879a65f7d0ae2ad105010ffc.jpg"><br><br>  I would also like to say a few words about the sachet in which the Nokia X is located. I would not at all desire call the 2-core Qualcomm S4 Play MSM8225 a ‚Äúpowerful processor‚Äù even last year, when I got acquainted with the half-dozen Highscreen smartphones with 2 and 4 -nuclear versions of this particular chipset.  Next - why point Asphalt 8 in a series of seemingly pre-installed games, if it is not there?  By the way, I managed to install this game with great difficulty, and not at all by ‚Äústandard‚Äù means of a smartphone.  From the same opera - why is there ‚ÄúYandex.Navigator‚Äù, which a) is not installed b) Nokia seems to prefer to boast about its Here Maps. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4d3/c66/ec1/4d3c66ec1d0cd14ff0204a6d4c0d4873.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Appearance </h4><br>  When you take the Nokia X in your hands, you immediately feel the main miscalculation of the case - sharp lower edges, which significantly dug into the palm.  I thought that similar strict ‚Äúbrick-like‚Äù contours ended with dual-purpose smartphones of B-brands of 2012, but no - get it, sign it.  Highscreen Zera F could expect the same fate, but the potential miscalculation of ergonomics was resolved utterly by a banal rounding from the rear to the sides.  So the model lies in the hand like a glove, and does not cause negative with its chopped features. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f88/059/a57/f88059a5736db7dd31cf67ca4b5893f8.jpg"><br><br>  If we talk about the design of the Nokia X as a whole, it left me rather a positive impression.  Any identity is present, the model is clearly not attributable to faceless clones among low-cost Android-smartphones.  Plus, the "ears" are obvious, that is, the outlines, the lines of Lumia and Asha.  The latter includes even inexpensive phones, but still pretty.  What Nokia X takes is a variety of body colors.  I see six colors on the promotional photos, and four on the Nokia website.  The colors are mostly juicy "youth".  Only here in a separate sale of covers, I do not see. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/68e/ff6/35c/68eff635c8be350fd42bd44e110a646b.jpg"><br><br>  For information, now in the B-brand smartphones a variety of complete covers has become almost a trend.  You don‚Äôt need to go far, Just5 Spacer for the same price (this is at 5 inches and 4-core MediaTek MT6582) in the box there are two covers at once, white and black.  On the Highscreen Omega Prime Mini with five multi-colored panels of decent quality and nothing to say. <br><br>  The thickness of the Nokia X exceeds the competitor - 10.4 mm versus 9.9 mm.  By weight - according to official figures, the "Finn" 128 g, "Russian" -136 grams.  But subjectively, it seems that Nokia X is harder. Just in case, I even used a kitchen electronic clock - 130 g for Nokia, 132 g for Highscreen.  Anyway, both devices do not burden with weight, but they do not seem too light either. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/667/bb2/c24/667bb2c24ecbd34faa2aec88c8d5918b.jpg"><br><br>  The case materials of the models are somewhat different.  For Nokia X, they preferred a budget matte plastic, which over time, when using the device without a case, will most likely wipe.  Plus the coating is rather slippery.  This moment specifically in Nokia X does not make itself felt, but in some 5-inch Nokia XL can draw attention to themselves.  The ‚ÄúGiraffe‚Äù is doing better, with a less branded and more ‚Äúclever‚Äù polycarbonate with a rubberized component.  Funny, in the Highscreen Zera F press release, it‚Äôs stated: ‚ÄúPolycarbonate case with velvety coating - like all the Nokia Lumia‚Äôs‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/02b/485/3b5/02b4853b5af2735dde5d15606e1247b4.jpg"><br><br>  In general, Highscreen Zera F borrowed from Nokia Lumia not only the texture of plastic, but also the style of performance of the camera's eye.  Let me remind you, the paradox of the model is that this is the first full-fledged OEM product of the brand.  But at the same time, Highscreen does not hide at all where it spied on the flagships of last year. <br><br>  For the build quality I put Nokia X strong five points - a monolith as it is, I haven‚Äôt seen such a ‚Äúsilent‚Äù case for a long time.  Highscreen Zera F did without significant drawbacks, but the lid no, no, and break the silence with a weak crunch. <br><br>  With the ergonomics of the keys, I have a claim to both devices.  So, Nokia X at first glance is pleased with the presence of the volume and power keys just above the middle on the right side.  However, for a normal press of the power button or the decrease of the sound, you constantly have to ‚Äúlift‚Äù the body in your hand so that almost a third of the screen is beyond the reach of your finger.  Highscreen Zera F has its own "cockroaches" - the power key at the top, the most inconvenient option for almost any diagonal.  Moreover, because of the flat end, you have to additionally bend your finger in order to make a click on the already low-profile button. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bae/4d1/059/bae4d10599b39122c187d64528d40f26.jpg"><br><br>  With the keypad, Nokia decided to copy iPhone to demonstrate an original approach with just one touch button.  She - the key "home" and "return".  In fact, Nokia‚Äôs desire to distance itself from Android (and Android-based smartphones) deprives users of the convenience available to owners of less restrictive brands. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3bb/f2f/d17/3bbf2fd1784855750f63455813344950.jpg"><br><br>  The models have almost the same distance from the bottom edge of the case to the display, but from the top they are different, the Nokia X is much more ‚Äúsquat‚Äù.  There are both pros and cons.  I liked to talk with such a body, together with a small bevel of the angle, it turned out to be a very comfortable option for the ear.  But when it comes to games, web surfing and other tasks in landscape orientation, holding and using Highscreen Zera F is a lot more fun. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/89e/23d/24b/89e23d24b3eff8a7229e2c1a06e7565b.jpg"><br><br>  The microUSB connector in smartphones at the top is not observed, and thanks for that - there will be no hassle when trying to talk while charging. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/92e/473/1cb/92e4731cb4011639fdf49a02b061953d.jpg"><br><br>  From the rear it becomes clear that Nokia X is useless as a flashlight, but the Highscreen Zera F can help out. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/98f/889/fe3/98f889fe3a93ea455f824e316391a1da.jpg"><br><br>  Under the covers we see that the Nokia X has two slots for microSIM cards, while the Giraffe has the usual miniSIM.  I consider the latter to be preferable, no hassle for trimming or receiving a new SIM card, if before that you exploited miniSIM exclusively.  In both smartphones, microSD memory card slots do not have spring mechanisms; it is not always possible to remove the card from the first time. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/569/087/fab/569087fabb363362602b0a407531ba9b.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Camera </h4><br>  Highscreen Zera F does not stand out among its allies for the price - front 0.3 Mp, rear 5 Mp without autofocus.  Nokia X ‚Äúon paper‚Äù is sadder, there is no front camera at all, and the rear one is just 3 megapixels for children today, severe greetings from the 2000s.  Immediately to the point - oddly enough, the camera (in particular, the main one) is the only point where the Nokia X almost completely surpasses the Highscreen Zera F. The Nokia model has much less problems with white balance, the scenes with contrasting lighting are relatively well worked out (without HDR), and in low light conditions the shots look more convincing.  Finally, the most important thing is that with Nokia X you can take photographs of books, information on stands, notes ‚Äî without clarity ‚Äî the clarity is not up to par, but there is enough to understand what is written. <br><br>  The first example is Nokia X, the second is Highscreen Zera F. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/79e/d47/9e9/79ed479e987ec840d0132c62b2e4e4f4.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c06/4e2/b16/c064e2b1634dfda18e89ba7dfab79881.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/284/9e9/193/2849e9193a5619800cca2878b01a942e.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/78a/633/7b0/78a6337b0c610eac2531e30fca9ea81d.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e6e/af0/284/e6eaf02842c9ee97e69940cdd2eba2d1.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/48d/cd7/030/48dcd70309d5898de196f832036933fa.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c36/31f/97f/c3631f97f32e54cbe14d8c58ae2202ee.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/850/35e/beb/85035ebebb8ea2a4dfe6315baec914be.jpg"><br><br>  At the same time, it should be understood that both cameras are not the best solution even for ‚Äúposting photos‚Äù in social networks.  I note that I don‚Äôt stick too much to the decadent moods of some observers in the Nokia X camera issue - 5 megapixel modules in the bulk of [ultra] budget smartphones do not give the best picture quality. <br><br>  I also praise the Nokia X shooting app. Instant access to white balance and exposure, clear settings without cluttering up those - I can only welcome this approach.  This is much better than the stock misunderstanding of any Android 4.0 and higher.  Yes, MediaTek on the example of Highscreen Zera F is also not the worst interpretation of the shooting tool, but I prefer the adequate minimalism of the Nokia X.  It would be absolutely wonderful to get rid of annoying abbreviations in the names of the items. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3d6/23d/a7f/3d623da7fb924af8ff5b04da5732aa8f.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/01c/d29/a66/01cd29a6612085860b8b09ecf8fdbadd.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Screen </h4><br>  4 inches, resolution 480 x 800 pixels and IPS-matrix - three of the same parameters of Nokia X and Highscreen Zera F. Encouraging characteristics, a year ago in the category up to 5,000 rubles (~ $ 138) there was no talk about anything better than TFT-TN .  Immediately to the good - the displays of both models left a positive impression on me.  Last year, I repeatedly encountered the fact that in budget smartphones under the IPS-matrix they gave out something unintelligible, with an unacceptable color inversion when looking at an angle.  The only significant minus Nokia X and Highscreen Zera F - not the highest maximum brightness and lack of means of dealing with sunlight.  All this leads to the fact that on a particularly clear day (and most of them are now), the picture significantly fades, although it is enough to dial the subscriber number or read / create an SMS. <br><br>  The color rendition, the sensitivity of the sensors - by four, with a slight plus, there would be more such matrices in the "up to five pieces" segment.  If we talk about the difference between the models, then the overall quality is slightly higher in favor of the Highscreen Zera F. But I emphasize - ‚Äúa little‚Äù, almost in every aspect I ‚Äúsat and delved‚Äù to consider the differences.  "Giraffe" shows a slight superiority in the contrast of the image, the saturation of color reproduction, while Nokia X slightly overexpresses the image, losing details.  Pure white for Nokia X is exactly ‚Äúclean‚Äù, on the Highscreen Zera F screen there is a noticeable departure in blue tones.  In black, it is difficult to identify the winner - and there, and there is a noticeable orange "touch", except that Nokia X starts to notice more uneven backlighting.  As you know, when looking diagonally IPS-displays like to be covered in orange or blue.  So, in comparison with the Nokia X, on the Highscreen Zera F screen, this effect is least pronounced. <br><br>  Top - Highscreen Zera F, bottom - Nokia X. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/970/b7a/b56/970b7ab56bc7b778c3a9443dbb8e389a.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d84/99e/3aa/d8499e3aac16d3aef0253a6af58065f9.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1ac/2e0/da8/1ac2e0da84688a4cdb57a1a6e7fd31e0.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/09a/a42/475/09aa42475e7cbf4c02b78ca455106edc.jpg"><br><br>  By default, both smartphones have a protective film attached.  Only I didn‚Äôt like the Nokia X with the blue corner for hitting it - they say, the sticker is only for careful transportation from the factory to the buyer.  The screen cover models - tempered glass.  It‚Äôs not quite clear to me where Eldar Murtazin saw plastic on the front of the Nokia X, and even more so because it is ‚Äúrough, because when touched and moved, it creates an unpleasant impression, as if the finger does not slide across the screen.‚Äù  Nothing like me was noticed. <br><br><h4>  Performance </h4><br>  Nokia X has nothing to brag about: 2-core Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 Play (MSM8225), Adreno 203 and 512 MB of RAM.  Just in case, let me remind you that the Qualcomm MSM8225 with the unpresentable Cortex-A5 and 45-nm process technology belongs to the most budget category in the Qualcomm Snapdragon lineup.  By the way, just a year ago, Highscreen Spark was released with the exact same processor and RAM (with the same diagonal and screen resolution) - for 3,990 rubles (~ $ 110). <br><br>  The Highscreen Zera F uses the more current 2-core MediaTek MT6572 (Cortex-A7, 1.2 GHz, 28 nm) in conjunction with the Mali-400MP, the amount of RAM is notable considering the price - 1 GB. <br><br>  With memory, each model had its flaws.  In Highscreen Zera F, all 4 GB are allocated to system memory, not a single megabyte is allocated as an ‚Äúexternal‚Äù drive.  That is, without a memory card, it will not be possible either to photograph or install any game with a cache.  Moreover, a number of programs I refused to work normally, because  they simply had nowhere to temporarily save the image-interface elements. <br><br>  However, the Nokia X still raised more questions.  So, 1.29 GB - system memory, and 1.17 GB - as a "USB-drive."  I ran into the most serious problem when trying to install Asphalt 8, which I saw on the sticker on the bag.  The game is in the company's online program store, which Nokia is trying to replace Google Play without success.  So, after downloading and running, I was categorically denied installation of the cache - they say, there is not enough space.  So fervently nudge to install the game, for which there is not enough memory?  Ok, insert the microSD card and ... no effect - the game "does not see" the card. <br><br>  Maybe we will try to transfer the game to the map through the ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù / ‚ÄúApplications‚Äù?  Again zero reaction.  In this case, in the memory section, in principle, there is no option that allows you to select the installation location of the programs - unlike the Highscreen Zera F. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a23/46c/ced/a2346cced32c0d2d001536480ebb02a2.png"><br><br>  What is the method?  True, in order to avoid a conflict between the cache versions and the installation file from the ‚Äúlayout‚Äù, both components are ‚Äúpoured‚Äù onto the memory card.  After this we do the installation, and the smartphone successfully picks up the cache.  The last two paragraphs may seem like puffing up an elephant from a fly, but in fact, Nokia completely deprives users of the ability to properly install "heavy" games. <br><br>  The situation was resolved as follows - an APK file was pulled out of Highscreen Zera F from the installed game via ASTRO file manager.  After its launch, Nokia X safely ignored the previously copied cache and climbed on its own to download dopfiles.  Happy end?  As if not so, at the very first start, I was [not] intrusively notified about the availability of an update, which you definitely need to download via ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f57/418/4e2/f574184e239afee675d237f147e14028.png"><br><br>  ... In short, in order to avoid another emerging varicose veins of the rectum, we had to play exclusively offline, first turning off Wi-Fi before launching Asphalt 8. <br><br>  So, the speed in the games was tested on the following titles: Riptide GP2, Asphalt 8, Dead Trigger 2 and Shadowgun: DeadZone.  In this list, I wanted to see Modern Combat 4, but it did not work out.  One installer tightly hung up the smartphone, the second one introduced the file verification operation (with a successful ending) into recursion, the third politely offered to buy a license.  Although YouTube confirms that comrades still managed to launch MC4 on Nokia X. It didn‚Äôt happen with GTA: SA, the game stubbornly went online for additional files and predictably did not find any sources for downloading.  Similar happened with GTA: VC. <br><br>  In the course of reading the reviews on the Nokia X, I came across a mention of the fact that some games do not want to run and stubbornly require the presence of Google Play.  I remember exactly in one of the materials an example of Asphalt 8, with which I did not show similar problems.  But with "Iron Man 3" - please. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d0f/7b9/836/d0f7b98361afc8654cb704fb449244ce.png"><br><br>  About the main thing, that is, about the behavior of Nokia X in games.  If you still manage to launch a title on this model, then with a high probability you will even enjoy the game.  In fact, I came across MSM8225 in at least two smartphones and almost did not experience performance problems.  For the simple reason that, surprisingly, smart phones have clearly turned off any shader effects and quietly worked through simplified textures.  Although specifically in the Nokia X, I did not notice this effect.  In any case, it should be understood that the limit of the capabilities of the smartphone is the game process on the medium, and better low graphics settings.  As soon as the maximum was set in the same DeadZone, a regular slide show began, the same effect was observed in Asphalt 8. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/07d/663/e91/07d663e917309a0907ff8c821323174c.png"><br><br>  Just Highscreen Zera F showed its superiority at the maximum of options - the frame rate, though it began to sink, but sporadically.  Even in GTA: SA, the limit of possibilities was not the distance of drawing, but the level of reflection of surfaces. <br><br>  Now to the benchmarks, more precisely, AnTuTu Tester.  No wonder - the Highscreen Zera F, though not ‚Äúhead on‚Äù, but is noticeably ahead of the competitor with a less powerful platform. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/116/f38/f38/116f38f387958b35762f051658472e8c.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Video </h4><br>  For comparison, I traditionally used the test files from the method IXBT.  The results speak for themselves - Nokia X successfully failed the test.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In fact, this is the case when copying the video "blindly" will not work - you need to run the movie on Nokia X just in case to make sure that there are no problems or the need to compress the file. Moreover, the results of the IXBT commercials left me with a sense of incomplete verification, so just in case I uploaded three more of my own clips ‚Äî in HD and Full HD resolution. Highscreen Zera F did an excellent job with all 720p commercials and refused to play 1080p smoothly. Nokia X has failed all attempts. That is, viewing HD-content is excluded, there is nothing to do here without compressed files.</font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2b8/d2c/e77/2b8d2ce77df4279fd3658707e3d81be6.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Software </h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So we got to the most ambiguous moment in Nokia X. The Finnish manufacturer shyly tries to hide the Android-essence of the smartphone and show its ‚Äúindividuality‚Äù. It turns out very badly, because in comparison with any current Android-smartphone, work at Nokia is most associated with ‚Äúa crutch on a crutch sitting and a crutch chasing‚Äù. In the section ‚ÄúAbout the phone‚Äù we are told that in front of users there is no Android at all, but ‚ÄúNokia X software platform 1.0‚Äù. I remember the words from one well-known movie: ‚ÄúSo he will split at this jump, a radish, at the first whiz!‚Äù. Yes, there are certain problems with disguise, even AnTuTu immediately indicated the presence of a certain ‚Äú4.1.2‚Äù - and this is clearly not a version of that Nokia platform.</font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/245/257/d8f/245257d8f711a3f7d5ac85c576e0614b.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/555/e68/959/555e6895913d7d4f369ccaea20d190ab.png"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In short, if you still do not know, I will tell you what the program shell of the model is. The main screen is an attempt to show Nokia‚Äôs commitment to the tiled principles of Windows Phone. A continuous vertical sheet of tiles, each can be reduced / enlarged, folder creation is also available. There are no additional desktops. And even the "second", a complete list of programs you will not find here - all applications and widgets are crammed in a single window with vertical scrolling. Is it bad? In my opinion, no. If we talk about "vertical", we saw the same thing in the shell of Feel UX in Sharp smartphones in 2012. There is no hidden behind the desktops list of all programs? So this is a normal situation in almost half of the branded shells of manufacturers, I will at least remember at least Huawei smartphones.</font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a27/8b9/362/a278b936277772aea458cc798d6fb7d1.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/48c/9ba/92b/48c9ba92b0fea211bec4f08d9904a377.png"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Scrolling the screen to the right or left opens the "Recent" dialog, also known as "Fasltlane". At first glance - the task manager, but due to the limited amount of RAM, this somehow does not believe it. And, you know, I really liked this ‚ÄúFasltlane‚Äù. Firstly, seven items are displayed in one window, not three, as in Highscreen Zera F. Secondly, the fact that, in usual Android, it hides behind the notification curtain, it is integrated into this dialog. Even the current cache load Asphalt 8 was displayed in the list. And it is very convenient.</font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/259/78e/e55/25978ee555a56746cd81b437c85b4f4b.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fe1/adb/bc4/fe1adbbc4f913f20ebef20e0503f7cb5.png"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Another thing is that you cannot call Fasltlane on top of a running application, you must exit the program and scroll through the screen. Minus to the speed of switching between tasks. In general, the interface of Nokia X SP impresses me, but with a reservation. The Finns managed to create a simple and intuitive shell. It is almost impossible to get confused here, this is almost an ideal variant of a ‚Äúsmartphone for relatives‚Äù. No wonder that many WP-backgrounds are recommended for non-advanced users. Still, sorting out the ‚Äúbare‚Äù Android with a swoop for the ‚Äúteapot‚Äù is not a trivial task.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Oh bad. There are problems with the speed of work. The main shame of the system is such a window that I see when I try to quickly return from the program to the desktop. Moreover, it would be okay if we were talking about some Asphalt 8, so I‚Äôve seen a similar warning when exiting the Quadrant menu. </font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/996/94f/41e/99694f41efe402ce7bc6d88860b7c620.png"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At first, I didn‚Äôt even notice the low speed - it was cleverly disguised as a smooth switch, there was no obvious interface twitching, there was no lag. However, as soon as you return to the Highscreen Zera F, everything falls into place. In the future, these same Aghi met more often, I hope Nokia will deal with problems in the next system updates.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I praised the shell, but only in terms of the interface - and from the point of view of inexperienced users. Everything related to the full-fledged Android-infrastructure, familiar to any Android smartphone, as if to put it mildly, is not impressive. Best of all, the situation is characterized by the title of one of the reviews: "Nokia X Dual SIM: what is Android without Google." The answer is that this is a very strange product, for which even getting an official YouTube client using standard tools is extremely difficult.</font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/815/8a8/66f/8158a866f7669dd3bcf15042c1ad07e3.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/36e/1be/971/36e1be971262f469eb07a6cc855b8772.png"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">First of all, there is no Google Play. An attempt to replace it with Nokia‚Äôs own service and download offerings from all kinds of ‚ÄúYandex.Store‚Äù returns to the issue of crutches. The Nokia recommends tab looks especially mocking in this very Yandex.Store when you access it in search of a program because of its absence from the Nokia service. And this very service is quite buggy. So, when trying to install the VKontakte application, he recommended that I update the phone software, otherwise, they say, the installation of the client is impossible. I go to the settings, check for updates, but no - it's empty. How to understand this - God knows. As a result, downloaded "Contact" from Yandex.Store.</font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9b0/069/71b/9b006971b2bc19f9ec6df29356a0a144.jpg"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">On the other hand, installing Google Play is allowed by the simple application of the Nokia X / XL Tools program. On the third hand, for those users who are primarily addressed to the plain Nokia X SP, any ‚Äústep aside‚Äù will cause paralysis from fear. Well, there will be no accountant Anna and plumber Vasily bother with such difficulties. By the way, to the question of alternatives - no one bothers to install any other shell. It is even welcome, as it can positively affect the speed of work. ‚ÄúYandex.Shell‚Äù showed itself well, but Go Launcher EX didn‚Äôt please us with its smooth animation. Plus, you need to remember that the alternative shell will not introduce the standard task manager, but it will easily hide Fasltlane permanently.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the context of comparison about Highscreen Zera F there is almost nothing to say - Android 4.2.2 as it is, with a couple of additional programs from MediaTek. Nokia X can be praised at least for the fact that, after it, you see the things that seem mundane in Android with particular warmth. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A few words about the pre-installed Nokia X software. Among others, we have a non-standard music player, MixRadio, Viber, Skype / Twitter / Facebook clients, ASTRO file manager, WeChat. I really wanted to evaluate MixRadio, but the program required an update, offering to search for it in the Nokia service or on Yandek.Store, but there was no application in both stores.</font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bd8/c96/7d4/bd8c967d4f2564cce08186f959bdb635.png"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Perhaps, the map maps service Here Maps deserves special attention, making it possible to download maps for offline navigation free of charge. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The GPS module works fine, the search for satellites takes less than a minute - everything is in perfect order with both smartphones.</font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/47e/229/319/47e229319963b2946e429fd05030823e.png"><br><br><h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Autonomy </font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Nokia is equipped with a 1,500 mAh battery, the Highscreen Zera F has a slightly larger margin - 1,600 mAh. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The difference in autonomy can be seen in the diagram - more advanced process technology and battery capacity make themselves felt, Highscreen Zera F in places noticeably ahead of Nokia X. The data are given in minutes.</font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/90f/c98/c8b/90fc98c8b08937855638a7cceb960b0a.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  After reading a lot of reviews on the Nokia X, I was extremely skeptical about the model, but it wasn‚Äôt as bad as it seemed.  The main thing is to understand that Nokia X still has its own niche, I would divide the potential owners of the model into two main groups.  The first - geeks, lovers of "garage work".  Those who like to experiment with the firmware, ‚Äúsqueeze the maximum‚Äù, etc., from this point of view, the Nokia X is an excellent and very inexpensive toy.  The second group - the above-mentioned "relatives".  If the future owner is not guaranteed to appreciate the capabilities of Android and rather fictitiously wants to join the world of smartphones, Nokia X will be a good choice.  Mainly due to the extremely simple to learn interface. <br><br>  I would not advise everyone else to make a choice in favor of the Nokia X, even of particular love for the brand or bright panels.  Even if you do not specifically take into account the Highscreen Zera F, against the background of the standard functionality of Android-smartphones, the Nokia X craftsmanship causes at least bewilderment.  Attempting to invent a bike with an approach like ‚ÄúAndroid, but not like Android‚Äù initially looked suspicious.  The result, from the point of view of a more or less progressive user, is sad.  If to compare with Highscreen Zera F, relatively higher performance, system stability and the initial lack of need for ‚Äúcrutches‚Äù make the model more attractive.  And you should not forget about the advantage in autonomy.  The only thing Nokia X bypasses the competitor is in the camera.  Not the most consolation against the background of flaws.  I will not talk about expensive / cheap, just to remind the prices of models: Highscreen Zera F costs 3,990 rubles (~ $ 110), Nokia X in the "white" retail will cost 4,990 rubles (~ $ 138). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/221365/">https://habr.com/ru/post/221365/</a></p>
