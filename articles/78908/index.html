With a large number of incoming calls from other operators, this is a very profitable rate, since  the user is credited with cash bonuses (3.5 kopecks) for each minute of the incoming conversation. <br><br>  From December 1, 2009, Beeline introduced the "improved" version of this tariff plan, the essence of the improvements is that when you make calls within the network, only the first minute of the call is paid, then - for free. <br>  Of course, I wanted to switch to the ‚Äúimproved‚Äù version, especially since they promised to make the transition for free and save money on the bonus account.

      The list of amazing rakes that were waiting for me at every corner of this seemingly simple action is under the screen. <br><br>  <b>Attention!</b>  <b>A lot of boring text.</b>  <b>No pictures.</b>  <b>Actual only for Ukrainian users of Beeline, and, most likely, only for users of ‚ÄúAllo Beeline‚Äù / ‚ÄúTheir people‚Äù.</b> <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  First of all, I was surprised by the construction of the tariff line in the old and new tariffs: <br><br>  <i>in the tariff Allo Beeline (normal)</i> <br><br>  Outgoing to Beeline - 7 kop / min <br>  Outgoing to your favorite Beeline number - 3.5 kopecks / minute <br><br>  <i>in the tariff Allo Beeline (improved)</i> <br><br>  Outgoing to Beeline - 7 kop / first minute, then 0 kopecks all subsequent <br>  Outgoing to your favorite Beeline number - 3.5 kopecks / minute <br><br>  That is, it turns out that calling your favorite number is cheaper only if the call duration is less than 2 minutes.  Well, okay, this is just not the strangest thing. <br><br>  Go to the new TP proposed in two ways: <br><br>  1) Through the service control panel in the " <a href="https://poslugy.beeline.ua/">Personal Account</a> "; <br>  2) Via the voice menu of changing the tariff plan to the number 067400; <br><br>  On the evening of December 20, I decided to use method number 1. <br><br>  To enter your personal account, you must send a request * 110 * 9 # and get a login / password to access the system.  In my <i>humble</i> request was received sms with the text <br>  ‚ÄúVybachte, dana posluga dlya Vas nedostupna‚Äù (Sorry, this service is not available for you). <br><br>  Slightly ofigev with surprise, I decided to call the operator at number 0611 to find out why it was me. <br><br>  When I called from my mobile, I was waited for by a ‚Äúpleasant‚Äù surprise in the form of a non-working voice menu.  After selecting the dialogue language, when choosing any option (1, 2 or 3), I returned to the same ‚Äúfirst‚Äù menu. <br>  References, in general, did not work. <br><br>  When I called the operator from a fixed phone, I explained the essence of the problem, after which I (extremely politely) were advised to change the TP via the number 067400, and to file the applications for the presented claims and wait for their fulfillment. <br><br>  As of December 22, the voice menu was repaired, access to the personal account still does not work for me or any of my friends who use this operator. <br><br>  <b>Attention, hint.</b> <br><br>  When calling the operator after 0611, I was asked to wait, as a rule, for 20-30 minutes (!) Before the release of the human operator. <br>  When calling from a landline to a toll-free number, the waiting time was never more than 2 minutes. <br><br>  The end of the hint. <br><br>  By calling the number 067400 I learned from a polite robot that for changing the tariff plan I need UAH 9.75 on the main account. <br><br>  When I tried to <a href="https://www.portmone.com.ua/beeline/uk/">replenish an account</a> from the site (I confess honestly, before that I had never replenished my account from the moment I purchased my starter account, I had enough bonuses), I received a funny error ‚ÄúTechnical problem when transferring your number‚Äù (Technical problem when checking your number). <br><br>  Again a call from a landline operator, "Yes, yes, we know about this error, wait." <br><br>  By lunchtime, on the 21st of December, the replenishment through the site was successfully repaired. <br><br>  After replenishing the account to 10 UAH, I call 067400 again, I choose a tariff plan change, I receive ‚ÄúYour account has been received‚Äù (your request has been accepted), I‚Äôm glad to see you receive the SMS ‚ÄúNot enough funds in the account‚Äù. <br><br>  Extremely surprised, I‚Äôm calling the operator, clarifying the ingenious - to switch to the "improved" plan, you need not 9.75 but 16 UAH on the main account (at the same time, they are not withdrawn, the transition is still free, just "it‚Äôs necessary that System works‚Äù) by number 067400, to put it mildly, I lied. <br><br>  I replenish the account with another UAH 6, I call a false robot and ... the option to change the tariff plan disappeared from the voice menu. <br><br>  Those.  I was not allowed to change the TP due to lack of funds in the account, but in the menu for selecting the service it was already gone, as was used. <br><br>  A call to the operator, a short story on how I <s>spent the summer</s> trying to change the tariff plan, the operator's attempt to change the TP to me manually, fail, ‚Äúsorry, the system did not work, I will issue an application for tomorrow‚Äù. <br><br>  I look forward with interest tomorrow in search of a new, unexplored rake. <br><br>  But in general, I have not tried to replenish my account yet, change the tariff plan, and calling a support service seemed like an excellent operator with favorable tariffs. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/78908/">https://habr.com/ru/post/78908/</a></p>
