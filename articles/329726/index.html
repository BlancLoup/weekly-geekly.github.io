Dozens of courses and trainings that promise you ‚Äúmodern pieces‚Äù that will make you a specialist in 1-2 months.  Why do we need 11 years of school and 5 institutes?  If there is an option to become a pro for quick.  The problem is that in 90% of cases it does not work.  This is just one type of business.  It will not work to become a master in 2 months.  But I want to believe in a miracle and beautiful advertising text helps you with this. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In my career I managed to go on both sides.  In the role of student and teacher.  He worked in an online school and studied in different institutions.  For 7 years in the development, I learned to learn and learn to teach. <br>  I did not like the option of paid courses, but the desire to help others remained.  So I started to stream.  I recruited free groups and perfected various programs, different explanations.  In the end, I realized that it makes no sense to prepare one program and tell the same thing from group to group.  You can not talk only about one part of the development of the project and not to talk about everything else.  You know how to very quickly and quickly peel potatoes but do not know how to make soup from it.  So you spend all your life on the blanks and did not become a chef. <br><br>  At the moment I like to share my experience in stream format.  This is a more natural and honest option.

      What we will do in the near future.  As I said above, I want every specialist to understand how the whole project works.  From prototype to sales.  Therefore, the first 2 months I will tell without going into details about all the stages of project development.  And after that we will begin to analyze each stage in detail.  Having an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow the entire project is being developed, it will be much easier to study the individual stages of development.  The first two months are mostly introductory information after which you can make your first website.  More precisely the first layout.  From this layout make a template for cms and send the whole thing to the hosting.  Yes, it will be a simple site.  But you will learn how it all works and then only improve your skills.  I do not promise everything at once.  I will train you 2 times a week, help you develop in the profession and answer all the questions you have. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.liveedu.tv/eboldarev/2b9eL-bystryi-start-v-veb-razrabotke/">Link</a> to the channel where it will be trained.  To take part in the training you need to purchase a subscription to the service LiveEdu.tv, the cost is 500 rubles (10% discount on the promo code: DenisMay2017). <br><br>  <a href="https://t.me/allwebpro">Chat in the telegram</a> where you, at any time, can ask questions related to training. <br><br>  Plan for the first 2 months: <br><br>  May 29, 20:00 - Introductory stream.  I am talking about the goals of the project, how the streams will be held and what the tasks will be ( <a href="https://www.liveedu.tv/eboldarev/2b9eL-bystryi-start-v-veb-razrabotke/AjgPq--2072/">you can see in the notes</a> ) <br><br>  <b>May 31 20:00 - Stages of project development.</b>  <b>Consider what are the stages and what each stage is important.</b> <br><br>  June 5 20:00 - Ideas, prototypes, project tasks.
