Unlike parcis, there are only two players, but there are more than four chips at their disposal, and all of them are on the board from the beginning of the game.  Blocking an opponent is an important part of the game, and the ability to play at stakes adds excitement.  As a result, the strategy is much more important in the game than it seems at first glance. <br><br>  <b>Game Review</b> <br><br>  At first glance, it seems that backgammon has nothing to do with games like Parchis, but their basic rules are really similar.  Two players take turns to roll the dice and move the pieces in a circle in one direction.  The result can be divided to resemble two chips, or move one chip twice. <br><br>  Unlike parcis, players move across the board in opposite directions.  Several checkers (chips) of one player can occupy one cell, blocking the opponent‚Äôs checkers from moving to this section (but not through him).  A double is counted as four dice with a drawn out number, which means the player can walk twice as much. <br><br>  At the beginning of the game, all the checkers are put on the field, which favorably distinguishes backgammon from Parchis, with its tightened, gradual introduction of chips, which strongly depends on the player‚Äôs luck.  The cell on which there is only one checker is called a ‚Äúblot‚Äù.  If the opponent's checker stops on it, the blot is considered beaten and placed on the ‚Äúbar‚Äù - the partition between the players' fields.  In his turn, the owner of the beaten checkers must, first of all, ‚Äúcharge‚Äù it ‚Äî return it to the field in the opponent‚Äôs house.  In this case, the checker can be put only on those cells whose numbers fell on the cubes. <br>  As the game progresses, it becomes more and more difficult to avoid capturing cells, but proper placement of checkers can significantly reduce risks.  If there is at least one beaten checker, the player cannot walk until he returns it to the field.  However, if both cells corresponding to the drawn numbers are occupied by two or more opponent's checkers, you will have to skip the turn. <br><br>  In some cases, thanks to a competent game and accompanying luck, you can completely block the "house".  Thus, the opponent will be forced to pass the course of the course, until you start to put checkers for the board.  ‚ÄúCharged‚Äù checker can be captured immediately after entering the field, but it can also beat the opponent‚Äôs blot. <br><br>  As soon as the checker enters the "house" - it becomes on one of the six cells that complete the full circle - it can be removed from the board.  To do this, you need to roll a die, and the resulting number must match the number of the cell on which the checkers are placed.  The player who removed all his checkers from the board before the opponent becomes the winner. <br><br>  Thanks to a combination of luck and mastery, backgammon attracts gamblers who prefer to play at the stakes.  Some sets include the so-called "doubling cube" - an additional cube, on whose faces the numbers 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 are printed. In order to raise the bet, before going, the player must place the cube with a face showing the coefficient increase, up.  The opponent can continue the game at double the rate or surrender.  If the opponent is confident in his abilities, he can double the stakes on his turn.  Many other rules are associated with the doubling cube, which continue to be updated to this day. <br><br>  <b>What can be learned from this game?</b> <br><br>  Although it is not obvious at first glance, a large number of chips, the ability to block an opponent and the movement of players towards each other give backgammon a strategic depth that is not enough for ordinary hodikam games.  A well-thought placement of checkers, taking into account options for subsequent moves, may force an opponent to separate their checkers, making them vulnerable, or block movement altogether. <br>  Of course, much depends on luck, but experienced players know how to wrap it to their advantage.  The point is to move the checkers to expand the space for their maneuvers and narrow down to his opponent.  In this way, you can protect yourself from an unsuccessful die roll and make your opponent play at random. <br><br>  The betting system significantly speeds up the process of the game.  If a player has strongly pulled ahead, it is in his interest to raise the stakes in order to finish the game as soon as possible.  When it becomes clear that the victory of one player is a matter of time, the game no longer needs to delay.  The game of betting is included in many amateur and tournament rules.  The most popular variations of this system can be found <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backgammon">on the English-language game page on Wikipedia.</a> <br><br>  Recently, desktop enthusiasts have become skeptical of games that are too dependent on luck, and developers are less likely to use the luck factor in their games.  However, backgammon provides a good example of how luck and strategic depth can be combined in a single game.  Players do not need to adjust their tactics to the rolls of the dice - moreover, the possible options only add depth to the game. <br><br>  <b>Monopoly</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2a0/d4f/314/2a0d4f314d014222bfffde987432990d.jpg"><br><br>  <i>Publisher:</i> Hasbro <br>  <i>Type:</i> economic board game for 2‚Äì6 players (the more players, the more interesting) <br>  <i>Difficulty:</i> low to medium <br>  <i>Creator:</i> Charles Darrow;  the prototype was the game The Landlord's Game ("Landowner") Elizabeth J. Maggie Phillips (there are other conflicting and unreliable versions of the emergence of the game). <br>  <i>Popularity:</i> high <br>  <i>Luck factor:</i> high <br><br>  <i>Description:</i> Players take turns throwing dice and moving around a square playing field, buying real estate and paying rent on cells owned by other players.  If the entire property of one color group belongs to one player, the rent increases, and if houses are built on plots, the amount becomes even greater.  However, the player rarely manages to collect all the plots of one group alone, therefore real estate trading is of great importance in the game.  The winner is the last remaining player, after all rivals have gone bankrupt and dropped out of the game. <br><br>  <b>Game Review</b> <br><br>  "Monopoly" is considered the most popular economic board game in the world, but among the fans of the board there is an opinion that it is too tight and too dependent on luck.  In this, of course, they are right, and yet the game fully pays for its shortcomings. <br>  The playing field is a square, divided along the edges into areas that players pass in a circle, taking turns to roll the dice.  Each time a player completes a ‚ÄúForward‚Äù circle completely, he receives a symbolic amount in the form of a ‚Äúsalary‚Äù.  On most plots are located real estate with the specified value.  Having completed his turn at such a site, a player can buy it out from the Bank (which owns all the tied property) and receive the appropriate card for ownership. <br><br>  Real estate brings the player income when it stops rivals.  If you do not want or can not purchase a lot, the Bank puts it up for auction for other players.  Interestingly, the role of the cubes changes at different stages of the game: at first they give players a lot of opportunities, but over time they become all the more dangerous. <br><br>  At the beginning of the game, each player receives 1500 thousand dollars and in the true spirit of capitalism must use this money with the maximum benefit.  Considering that income directly depends on the purchase of a drawn lot at the beginning of the game, all players have supposedly equal chances of getting rich.  However, the whole essence of "Monopoly" is how you manage and sell your property, and the subsequent hours of throwing dice and moving around the map will only show how effectively you do it. <br><br>  Players can trade in real estate among themselves on any conditions - assign any value, offer exchange or exchange with surcharge.  The site can also be deposited in the Bank for the amount indicated on the back of the card.  This can be done at any time, for example, to pay debts or get money to purchase another object (including at an auction). <br><br>  Having pledged the property, the player must turn the card on the right of ownership face down.  The pledged object ceases to generate income, and buildings cannot be built on it.  To redeem the property, you need to pay the bail amount and another 10% on top.  The ability to lay an object without putting it up for sale gives the player the freedom to choose, but half the cost is not the most advantageous offer.  The pledged property can also be sold to another player, and the buyer will have to immediately pay 10% of the deposit amount to the Bank and will not be able to use the object until it has repaid the remaining debt.  Therefore, mortgaged real estate, as a rule, is not in special demand. <br><br>  A real gold dwelling for a player is the possession of all areas of one color group.  It doesn't matter if you are lucky or you have made a competent deal.  It is important that now you can build houses on these sites.  The more houses built on the plot, the more money the player who has fallen on it must pay. <br><br>  The rent increases even with one house, and if you build three, it will grow several times.  Provided that there are already four houses on the plot, you can build a fifth building - a hotel.  If a plot with three houses can just hit the wallet well, then once on the plot with the hotel, the player can easily go bankrupt.  If a player runs out of all money and assets, he is declared bankrupt, and he leaves the game.  In this case, if a player becomes bankrupt because of debts to another player, the creditor receives all his property, which significantly increases the chances of winning. <br><br>  <b>What can be learned from this game?</b> <br><br>  If, after reading the rules of "Monopoly", you get the impression that the game reveals capitalism rather than praises it, you have hit the mark.  The predecessor of "Monopoly" - the game "The Landlord's Game" by Elizabeth J. Maggie Phillips - and completely openly criticized this economic system. <br><br>  The popularity of "Monopoly" negatively affects the game itself.  Many players who consider themselves to be fans, do not really play it as it was intended, but only according to terrible "home" rules, including jackpots for free parking and the absence of auctions.  This makes the already prolonged game even longer and brings the luck factor to the point of absurdity. <br><br>  Like backgammon, ‚ÄúMonopoly‚Äù is a strategic game that disguises itself as a game of ‚Äúluck‚Äù.  Although ‚ÄúMonopoly‚Äù is even more dependent on luck than backgammon.  Dice rolls can negate all the chances of winning.  As soon as you start losing, all further efforts to correct the situation will go to the cat's tail, and you will soon turn into a "feeder" for more lucky players.  In this sense, Monopoly resembles real market conditions, but, alas, this does not speak in its favor. <br><br>  A big plus of European board games (which we'll talk about in more detail in this article) is that they end up just when an unconditional leader appears among the players.  But in Monopoly, even when one player is far ahead of rivals, he can wait forever for them to go bankrupt.  A little consoling is the fact that the official rules also provide for a ‚Äúquick game‚Äù, at the beginning of which everyone gets a random section, and as soon as two players go bankrupt, the game ends. <br><br>  By and large, ‚ÄúMonopoly‚Äù is not so bad.  One of the advantages of the game lies in the fact that before buying up plots of the same color, you need to take into account several factors.  It cannot be said that the cheapest real estate is the most unprofitable, and the most expensive realy will certainly bring the maximum profit.  Among other things, the choice must take into account the likelihood of other players on your sites.  In any case, the cubes behave unpredictably, so it is best to act on the situation. <br><br>  In my opinion, the biggest drawback of ‚ÄúMonopoly‚Äù is that the game is too dependent on the decisions of individual players, which other participants cannot influence in any way.  For example, if two players exchange property in order to quickly collect areas of the same color, the rest simply will not have a chance. <br><br>  Without real estate trading, the game ‚ÄúMonopoly‚Äù turns into monotonous rolling of dice and collecting / paying rent.  If no player can collect the entire color group, it can go on forever.  All that players can count on in the absence of houses and hotels on the field is the salary in the Forward cage. <br><br>  Even if you play in the company of gamblers who are serious about winning, the deals will be concluded with great caution - hardly anyone wants to sell his opponent the last piece in the color group without receiving an equal offer in return.  Obviously, this atmosphere does not encourage players to trade and stops the entire gameplay.  That is why it makes no sense to play in the "Monopoly" together - making deals with a single opponent, you will not get far. <br><br>  <b>Scrabble</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9fa/e00/116/9fae00116c904868af8c17899f1962fa.jpg"><br><br>  <i>Publisher:</i> Mattel (International), Hasbro (in the USA and Canada). <br>  <i>Type:</i> word board game for two to four players. <br>  <i>Level of difficulty:</i> high <br>  <i>Creators:</i> Alfred Mosher Butts and James Bruno <br>  <i>Luck factor:</i> low / moderate <br><br>  <i>Description:</i> Players take turns filling the board with letter chips - while new words must intersect with previous ones. <br>  Points for words are awarded on the sum of the costs of letters (from 1 to 10, depending on the frequency of use of the letter in the language), while taking into account special cells (if they overlap, the cost of a letter or word is multiplied), and the use of all 7 chips per turn ( a bonus of 50 points is awarded).  The winner is declared the player with the most points at the time when there are no more chips to complete. <br><br>  <b>Game Review</b> <br><br>  Each player has a holder with seven randomly selected letter chips.  The rest of the chips go in the draw.  The game field consists of 15x15 squares with an asterisk in the central cell. <br><br>  Each player in turn puts the words from the chips on the board, one letter for each square (word compliance with the rules can be checked using a dictionary).  The first player can make any word of his chips, but new words should cling to the previous ones. <br>  Thus, there are two types of word formation: there must be a main word composed with the help of chips already placed on the board and chips from the hand, and there are other words ‚Äúintersecting‚Äù with those just laid out.  Outside the main word chips can not be placed. <br>  Points are awarded for each composed word.  According to the rules of the game, two or more new chips should form words.  There are two dummies - such chips can indicate any letters to choose a player, but they do not bring points.  After laying out, the dummy remains on the field until the end of the game. <br><br>  On each chip, with the exception of soothers, a number is written, indicating its value.  The word brings the player the sum of the points of his letters (both just laid out and already present on the playing field).  In addition, some cells contain special bonuses: doubling a letter, doubling a word, trebling a letter and trebling a word ‚Äî they affect the final number of points per word accordingly. <br>  Despite the fact that special cells are arranged in such a way as to minimize the likelihood of their use, they complement each other: points for a word include all letters with factors, and verbal factors can increase the final result by 4 or even 9 times.  Prize cells give bonuses only in the course in which the chip was posted.  There is also a bonus of 50 points for putting all the chips from your hand in one move, which is called bingo.  This bonus prize cells do not apply.  An initial cell with an asterisk is counted as a double word. <br><br>  After the effective move, the player takes the chips from the dobor to even their number with 7. If the player does not have the ability or desire to walk, he can partially or completely replace the chips from his hand with the chips from the dobor.  The game ends when there are no more chips.  However, according to the North American rules, the game ends when the player has no more chips in his hand, or six moves in a row were ineffective (if the score is not zero). <br><br>  If a player lays out a word that, according to the opponent, does not comply with the rules of the game, the word can be challenged.  The relevant rules vary in different countries.  In the USA, if a player disputes a word and turns out to be right, the word is removed from the board, and the author loses the move.  If the wrong word is played and not contested, and if the player disputes a suspicious, but at the same time real word, he loses his turn.  Advanced players can be cunning by putting out unknown words or believable "fakes". <br>  Scrabble rules vary slightly by country.  Different languages ‚Äã‚Äãuse different sets of letters with different cost of letters, which makes significant adjustments to the original game.         . <br><br> <b>     ?</b> <br><br>        , , ,            .      ,       ,   ,      .       ,      ,      (¬´Word Freak¬ª)     (¬´Word Wars¬ª). <br>       ,     ,      ‚Äì   - .      :       .    ,                   . <br><br>   ,             ,    ‚Äì      (   )    ,     . <br><br>        ¬´¬ª, ,    ,       ,    . <br>   ‚Äì     .   ,       ,            .   ,           ,      . <br><br> <b>  :</b> <br>            ¬´-¬ª,   ‚Äì <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/letters/2009/03/02/090302mama_mail1">  </a>       21 . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/302532/">https://habr.com/ru/post/302532/</a></p>
