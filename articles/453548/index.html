I must say that I can not stand to watch videos and read from the phone, as there is no complete immersion - workers and not so much calls, incoming mail, messages from instant messengers annoy me quite strongly.  Time passed, and I studied the offers of shops and selected a price / iron ratio, but did not stop at anything. <br><br>  It was the turn of the garage cleaning, where I found the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 "P3110 (without a SIM card slot). For the sake of interest I turned on, it blinked the screen and loaded Android 4.1.

      Great, I thought, a reliable piece of hardware, if for a couple of years of being in an unheated room it started up and booted.  Perhaps I will take it under my book.  Actually, this way I got the opportunity to re-read the contents of the page several times while the text scrolls to the next one, and to watch my favorite TV shows step by step. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, the tablet configuration: <br><br>  OS Android 4.1 <br>  Dimensions 194x122x11 mm <br>  Weight 344 g <br>  Capacitive sensor, multitouch <br>  7 inch display <br>  Wi-Fi Wi-Fi 802.11n, WiFi Direct, DLNA <br>  Bluetooth Bluetooth 3.0 HS <br>  GPS with A-GPS support <br>  GLONASS is <br>  CPU TI OMAP4430 (ARM32bit) <br>  1000 MHz frequency <br>  Core 2 <br>  GPU PowerVR SGX540 <br>  Memory 8 GB <br>  1 GB RAM <br><br>  Firstly, with the latest firmware, a bunch of services arrived, namely ‚Äúupdate‚Äù, ‚Äúdebugging‚Äù and ‚Äúfrom the manufacturer‚Äù, which cannot be disabled, but if you stop them, the performance will increase significantly. <br><br>  Secondly, the outdated version, when I tried to install 50% of the software from the Play Market, informed me that ‚Äúit is possible that the software is not optimized for your version of the OS‚Äù. <br><br>  After studying the search results, and stumbled upon the mention of custom firmware Lineage-OS, it was decided to make fun of the device, since there is no practical use anyway. <br><br>  The process of firmware is described in a myriad of manuals, but still finding the path took time, publish your recipe. <br>  UPD: <a href="https://lineageos.org/">Lineage-os official website</a> <br>  <a href="http://andi34.github.io/roms_tab2_lineage.html">From here, we take custom firmware</a> , an alternative <a href="https://twrp.me/">TWRP</a> bootloader, a USB cable, <a href="https://developer.samsung.com/galaxy/others/android-usb-driver-for-windows">Samsung USB drivers</a> (for flooding TWRP firmware), the latest version <a href="https://samsungodin.com/">ODIN software</a> , <a href="https://opengapps.org/">Open Gapps</a> - Play Market for the selected version of Android, an 8GB microSD card, a desktop computer under Windows 10. <br><br>  Training: <br><br>  1. expand Odin from the archive (does not require installation) to disk, install the Samsung USB driver. <br><br>  2.1.  Swing TWRP.  As it turned out, ODIN sews from a special tar or tar.md5 format.  And on the TWRP site there is an img file with a fresh loader.  Android from version 7 has changed the format of the boot image, the 2.8 loader does not accept this format.  Therefore, paragraph 2.2 <br><br>  2.2.  Download <a href="https://androidfilehost.com/%3Ffid%3D24421527759882872">the tar file creation utility</a> that ODIN accepts.  Rename the downloaded TWRP file to ‚Äúrecovery.img‚Äù and upload it to the ‚Äúparts‚Äù directory of the utility.  Run the BAT file and after a couple of seconds pick up the twrp-3.1-p3110.tar file from the ‚Äúpackaged‚Äù directory, answering the question what we are doing (point 1 - the tar file) and the ‚ÄúY‚Äù button. <br><br>  3. Downloading Gapps, in my case, the type of processor ARM, OS 7.1, piko Gapps (the minimum set for the functioning of the Play Market) <br><br>  Process: <br><br>  4. Fill in the microSD OS, Gapps.  We insert into the tablet. <br><br>  5. On the off tablet, press and hold the power button and the volume down button.  We get into the bootloader firmware menu and click ‚ÄúConfirm‚Äù - the sound increase button - screen drivers are not loaded in the bootloader firmware mode. <br><br>  6. We connect a tablet and a computer with a cable, a certain Com port should appear in ODIN (in my case COM6).  Select the item "AP" and specify the TWRP firmware file (twrp-3.1-p3110.tar) in it.  Do a reboot of the tablet as ODIN completes the firmware. <br><br>  7. Hold the power button and add sound until the screen goes out and the tablet model appears again.  Next, the TWRP bootloader window opens. <br><br>  We need to do three things: make backup of the current firmware for rollback, clear the boot, cashe and data partition, fill the OS and Gapps. <br><br>  8. We perform backup partitions, tick System, Cache, Data, Boot (Internal Storage can also be specified, if you previously saved important data from there - this is the internal memory of the tablet).  Swipe to perform backup, waiting. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zo/wo/pz/zowopze7mmtv56b0ythpysbik4c.jpeg"><br><br>  9. Carefully erase (Wipe) with the help of the Advanced Wipe section - checkboxes next to System, Cache, Data and svayp. <br><br>  10. Proceed to install the OS: Install, select the lineage-os archive, add the gapps archive button.  to execute. <br><br>  11. Upon completion, select Reboot.  At this stage, I do not recommend experimenting with the suggestion of the bootloader to install Super SU ‚Äî the OS did not take off, I‚Äôll click Do Not Install. <br><br>  Of the errors: <br>  There is not enough RAM to install the OS and Gapps - we select a smaller Gapps archive. <br>  The OS is loading (the logo looks like a very sad smile) and nothing happens - remove the microSD and try to boot again <br>  In the OS, there is no Play Market - the wrong version of Gapps <br>  I still do not have landscape mode for the desktop, although applications run in landscape mode.  I am looking for a solution, maybe it will be in the comments. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/3o/ob/p3/3oobp32gqtfktuljkref0tbofnc.jpeg"><br><br>  Thanks for attention!!! <br><br>  PS: I apologize for the quality of the photo, it did not work out better. <br><br>  UPD2: Gapps can not be set, there will be no Google services, Play Market.  I am very lazy to track the updates of the applications I use, I set.  I noticed that without Gapps, the tablet is much faster.  In case I used this device as a multimedia device in a car or a set-top box, then I probably wouldn‚Äôt use Gapps. <br>  Or organize parental control over applications for children - completely manual installation of dad-approved applications (and mom). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/453548/">https://habr.com/ru/post/453548/</a></p>
