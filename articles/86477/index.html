Gratitude and questions please address to him.  Enjoy reading. <br><br><h5>  How much </h5><br>  After reading the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/android/78095/">review of the older model N21</a> , I became thoughtful about getting a little robot free then. <br><br><img src="http://www.scophone.com/syssite/home/shop/1/pictures/productsimg/big/4641.jpg" alt="Sciphone N19">

      Therefore, I carried out some simple operational-search measures, as a result of which I chose the <a href="http://www.scophone.com/product_4641.html">Sciphone N19</a> . <a name="habracut"></a>  He did not look so solid, but it was cheaper, and there was not a second sim card (+20 to endurance). <br><br>  He paid $ 156.09 with delivery, and sat down, arms folded, to wait. <br><br><h5>  What for </h5><br>  What did I need, why all these ridiculous gestures? <br><br>  See what kind of Android beast is: how convenient is it to use?  I tried a variety of operating systems - Palm, all kinds of Symbian, WinMobile, MacOS and so on.  The launch of Android is an important event, it gives us a vector of development of user interfaces, this is what everyone will have in 2-3 years. <br><br>  Since I have long been hooked on Google services, I also wanted to have them on hand all the time. <br><br>  Well, and - to play.  For a long time <s>I</s> didn‚Äôt <s>take checkers in my hands</s> but rewrote new devices with dubious assemblies and crooked patches. <br><br><h5>  Overview </h5><br>  The review will be unusual.  Since I did not get paid for it, I will modestly omit the technical specifications (well, there is WiFi and Bluetooth) and focus on the user's experiences and experiences.  My main perspective will be: <b>how comfortable</b> ? <br><br>  And as a kind of standard of convenience, I will take into my hands the good old ground-in Nokia 5310 and, as it were, I will constantly compare the convenience of communication.  I do not like to make photos and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DR0jvwaOEy94">videos</a> , so the photo from me will be only one. <br><br><h6>  Box and contents in hand </h6><br>  It came!  More precisely, with the battle I tore out of the liaison office: the postman escorted me with a farewell "Come without notice, there are only a few of you here, I know you all" (???) - apparently, those who receive shameful parcels from abroad. <br><br>  The box is cool, made of cardboard.  Inside the device, headphones, USB-miniUSB cable, and charging, which after 30 seconds left in a broken form in the garbage.  Well, I will charge from the computer. <br><br>  The phone is made to the touch with high quality, the assembly is good, nothing creaks and does not hang out.  Simka and flash drive are inserted from the side, regardless of the battery - convenient.  The keys on the face are not very comfortable. <br><br>  Screen - gloss, fak my brain.  Well, okay, the general impression is good. <br><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_R01FnYf38bo/S5CtekMzFNI/AAAAAAAAA68/02Jdol5kWvY/s640/DSC06992.JPG" alt="image"><br><br><h6>  Startup and configuration </h6><br>  On the phone - one and a half Android.  Honestly, I don't care what version there is, the main thing is that it works. <br><br>  The first launch is about 3-4 minutes, and it is unnerving!  Reboots too long enough.  I dig a little in the settings - the Android Market works out of the box, the settings are not enough, there is localization. <br><br>  Then I diligently went <a href="http://code.google.com/p/custom-android-sciphone-n19/">where necessary</a> , downloaded the official update, GoogleApps and the Russian TinyKeyboard keyboard from there.  Nakat update (exciting moment) - looked inside - nothing has changed.  Apparently, I had enough new firmware. <br><br>  I installed the keyboard, started to install GoogleApps, a couple of applications from the package gave a rejection, one got crazy, throwing out errors every 15 seconds - and I immediately demolished it.  I entered the password with my login into gmail, looked into the mail, and immediately fell asleep after that - it was a very disturbing day, a lot of new impressions. <br><br><h6>  In work </h6><br>  In the morning I looked at the toy - and did not believe my eyes.  Over the night, Android synced with Google services and showed me all the current contacts.  I almost wept, by golly.  So I got these endless syncs between different contact book formats. <br><br>  Lyrics!  <s>Burn in hell to the creators of Nokia PC Suite, Oxygene Phone Manager, Motorola's Eban soft software, to non-programmers from LG and Samsung, who drank a lot of my money.</s>  <s>Finally, I will demolish MS Office, which I kept only because of Outlook - an intermediary between Gmail and Nokia Ovi.</s> <br><br>  I don‚Äôt even know if there was any benefit from installing GoogleApps. <br><br>  The interface is a long conversation, because I will not be spreading very much across the tree.  Overall, good.  The screen is nice, the touch control has not yet become <i>really</i> comfortable, the buttons are still much more comfortable.  But at the same time, many interface solutions are very convenient, and quite deliver. <br><br>  Very unusual settings are organized.  But this organization is quite logical, although there are questions - in principle, there are no necessary settings.  No traffic counter, this is a minus. <br><br>  Convenience to call is satisfactory.  Dialing a number on the touchscreen is much worse, and this is a fact that cannot be changed programmatically.  Not yet found contact groups.  The quality of communication is so-so. <br><br>  SMS - I try not to use at all.  But, as in messengers, typing a message is better using the keyboard, even if it is virtual. <br><br>  The camera is scary to watch without tears.  Probably, in the phone there are all sorts of gadgets such as a voice recorder, radio, an accelerometer and other things, but.  To be honest - we in the life of this nonsense use 1-2 times. <br><br>  Embedded applications: icq-client does not support Cyrillic, it is better to download from the market.  Alarm clock would be worth the work.  Everything else works for me without any complaints, and even more than that - it pleases me with my work.  Glitches not yet detected. <br><br><h5>  Organizational Conclusions </h5><br>  Features: <br><ul><li>  The battery is weak, the buttons are uncomfortable, the sound is uterine in all directions </li><li>  Eating traffic be healthy </li><li>  You can forget about the problems with syncing contacts </li><li>  Installing additional applications is sweet and carefree </li><li>  The interface should better take into account the features of the touchscreen. </li><li>  Ready to work out of the box </li><li>  Great toy - more joy than problems </li></ul><br><br>  <b>Total: "for the money - no flaws."</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/86477/">https://habr.com/ru/post/86477/</a></p>
