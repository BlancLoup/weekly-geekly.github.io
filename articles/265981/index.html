      Immediately a <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/248560/">homeless programmer</a> came to mind, but after success with his application, he chose to remain a ‚ÄúZen monk‚Äù.  Are there any more examples?  An inspiring example that anyone can learn coding is a blind programmer.  When I read the article on Habr√© <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/260463/">"Looking at the code with my eyes closed,"</a> I realized that there are no barriers other than my own excuses. <br><br>  And I have for you three stories from my life.  Just three stories. <br><br><h4>  Story One - Lamer </h4><br>  The word "lamer" I <a href="http://old.computerra.ru/offline/1998/248/1354/">read</a> in "Computer".  The definition was given there: <i>‚ÄúLamer is not an illiterate person who does not know how (how could I put it more softly?) To program.‚Äù</i>  Inspired by the truth, I ran and told classmates to my friends, but they preferred to play football instead of mastering their superpowers.  It's funny that then they all earned money by programming, but I didn't.  A week later, I enrolled in the regional station of young technicians (KSYUT), where there was a programming circle.  There for beginners were given qbasic.  And the gods have fallen on C. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So somehow one of the "gods" called me to the monitor and asked: "So can you?".  And he showed the program, which was waiting for the user to enter any character in the command line, and then turn it 90 degrees.  I was stunned. <br><br>  Probably, it hooked me so much that I decided - no matter what, to learn everything I could and become the coolest programmer.  The charge was enough for years.  I forgot this case, several years passed, and, recalling it, I wrote no more than a dozen lines on basic ªe for 20 minutes. The program worked perfectly. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion.</b>  Personal relationships with the Padawans are very important.  Perhaps your unpretentious program will determine the fate of a person and affect the choice of life path. <br><br><h4>  The second story - the first cipher </h4><br>  The idea came suddenly.  I came so that I could not sleep and sat down to code.  From the ciphers, then I knew only about dancing little men from Sherlock Holmes (and this is class 8 or 9, he was engaged in programming for six months or a year).  I wanted to write a cipher so that it could not be so easy to open it with a simple analysis. <br><br>  The idea was as follows: we assign to each letter of the Russian alphabet an array of 5 characters in the form of letters of the Russian and English languages, special characters.  When encrypting, we randomly choose one of them.  It turned out "extended" simple replacement.  It is now clear to me how to break it, but then for me there was an exorbitant height.  In 3-4 years I will arrive on computer safety. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion.</b>  Solving interesting problems is awesome.  But it‚Äôs much cooler to invent and find tasks yourself. <br><br><h4>  The third story - the triumph of BASIC </h4><br>  I have been doing programming for 2 years.  And then in the school appeared ... computer science.  For some reason I was sent to a weak group.  As I found out later, my face did not like the teacher and she felt that I was stupid.  My friends broke into the office of the director and said that I had won a prize at the regional programming Olympiad.  The disassembly began, but I didn‚Äôt care so much that I stayed in a weak group, where they taught me to enter numbers into Excel.  For the first week I passed the entire program and calmly went to play Diablo 2 in a computer club. <br><br>  And at the Olympics was a funny case.  Allowed languages ‚Äã‚Äãare C, Pascal, and I was a hardened beysichnik.  Unscrew.  The task was taken in the form of exe'shnik, and I jumped around and found a BASIC, which forges exe'shniki.  Programs passed tests, and the tests themselves were taken on a server.  One task was purely computational.  The coordinates of the centers and the radii of the two circles were given.  It was necessary to produce a mutual arrangement of circles in text form: intersect, touch, one to another, coincide, and others. <br><br>  It was laziness to mess around with formulas, and recently I was just dealing with graphics.  I solved the problem graphically, drew a circle in one color, and then ‚Äúscanned‚Äù pixel by pixel by pixel along the second circle, do I stick into the already colored pixel.  There was a great fear that the program would not be able to work on a server without a monitor, but everything worked out - 10 tests out of 10. There was a high point on the task analysis.  Fifty people solved the problem one-on-one as an author, what was their surprise when I told my method. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion.</b>  School is evil.  The result is awesome.  Thinking outside the box is cool.  There is always a workaround. <br><br><h4>  Why do adults need to learn programming? </h4><br>  I have three answers to this question.  They depend on the planning horizon: <br><br>  - A goal for 1 week or month is a challenge.  It's like running a marathon or getting on Elbrus, checking if the brains are dry, getting out of the comfort zone. <br><br>  - The goal for a year or two is a loot.  During this time, you can learn to create value and work remotely.  Or teach others.  Many people want to learn how to program. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">proof</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bbe/bc3/a6b/bbebc3a6b3e4426ab2d047fa4df727ef.png" alt="image"><br><br>  I searched September 8 myself: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b21/5c6/9d9/b215c69d989846eb9f2bf78eedcf3e25.jpg"><br><br>  in Russian is 1000 times less: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3c3/41f/db2/3c341fdb225d4299948a9296a17f9168.jpg"><br></div></div><br>  - The goal for 5-10 years - the development as a whole.  First, you improve your thinking.  Secondly, you will make an invaluable gift to children.  They will get several years of odds in learning programming and you will have many wonderful moments of co-writing programs.  For complete happiness, it will remain to learn how to play computer games, but you most likely already know how to do this. <br><br><h4>  How to learn to program </h4><br>  There is a broken picture of this: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/89f/701/a54/89f701a5458327732ddcc040d8fcb8d8.png" alt="image"><br><br>  For some reason, everyone immediately begins to advise Knut, Kormen and others, but an unprepared person will be able to master only the preface.  If you have problems with self-esteem, take a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/265787/">children's book</a> and write a game. <br><br>  If you are ready to start in an adult, then there are plenty of resources for self-study.  From Coursera ( <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/pythonlearn">one</a> , <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/algs4partI">two</a> ) to all% name of% academy (codeacademy, htmlacademy, etc.) <br><br>  If the intentions are very serious, I can advise the course <a href="http://tceh.com/edu/rubyonrails/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dcontent%26utm_campaign%3Druby1">"Get into Ruby</a> . <a href="http://tceh.com/edu/rubyonrails/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dcontent%26utm_campaign%3Druby1">"</a> <br><br>  <b>Firstly</b> , there is a live teacher with a good background in development.
