Stylish Headphones Review</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c2f/008/149/c2f0081490e46bcb6363679d15e3994a.jpg"><br><br>  For a long time I used the headset, not only in conjunction with the phone, but also with the player.  As it turned out, the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/80920/">iPod Classic</a> opens the possibility of voice recording, if you connect the headset.  About a year later, Apple‚Äôs branded ears became unusable, as did telephone headphones.  I purchased the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/67534/">Razer Moray +</a> about which <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/boomburum/" class="user_link">Boomburum</a> wrote.  Headphones are not bad, but they have practically no tops and bottoms.  Yes, it is enough for games and telephone conversations, but to fully enjoy the works of Bach, all the same, is not enough.  Alas, these headphones also broke down after a year.  It's time to choose a new headset.  Without thinking, I picked up 4 pairs of good headphones with slightly different characteristics and prices.  Their review and submit to your judgment. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I don't want to buy what kind of headset, because  there is a desire for her to serve not a month, but at least a year or two.  It so happened that I do not count on anything more, because from the constant wearing of the headphones under the jacket they sooner or later fray the wire and one speaker stops functioning.  For me, the ideal was Moray +, but firstly they were already outdated, secondly, they didn‚Äôt suit me very much in terms of sound quality, and then, they were too boring in terms of appearance, I want something more stylish.  Of all the wide variety, I picked up the headset, which have good performance, stylish design and not exorbitant price.  Yes, I understand that there are cool headphones for 15 thousand rubles, but they are also likely to break in a year, and I don‚Äôt really want to spend money to prove it. <br>  The choice fell on the headset, not the headset, because with their help it is convenient to talk on the phone, as well as make audio notes.  In addition, for those who have a smartphone or tablet, this is the best way to communicate via Skype.  By the way, a headset is also useful for new ultrabooks, since  they lack a microphone jack, only one 3-pin headset jack remains.  But back from the lyrical part to the review. <br>  All headphones were tested in equal conditions, were used player Apple iPod Classic 160Gb, iPod Nano 6G, Samsung Galaxy S III.  Conditions were as close to reality as possible. <br><br><h4>  <a href="http://goodlocal.ru/catalog/items/pipe_mic/the_pipe_fool_s_gold_edition//">Aiaiai Pipe Fool's Gold Edition</a> </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/885/74f/72e/88574f72ee44ca23e6a9f21482105192.jpg">

    <ul><li>  Frequency range: 20 - 20000 Hz </li><li>  Impedance: 16 ohms </li><li>  Sensitivity: 105 dB / V </li><li>  Maximum power: 20 mW </li></ul><br>  As it turned out, a company with a funny Russian ear called Ayayy makes very good headphones.  Their design is rather classic, but the color scheme and some elements make them stylish and fashionable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/58a/500/e57/58a500e57e8c72eee73b37890d0730bc.jpg"><br><br>  The shape of the gags themselves is slightly elongated, which is why the headphones protrude a little from the ear, although it looks harmonious and does not interfere with the sensations.  I even tried them on with a cap, because  Often in the winter you have to use a headset in order to talk without removing the phone.  Everything is in order, there is no discomfort. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4b5/706/148/4b5706148034bac9690cee686b94456b.jpg"><br><br>  Headphone case is completely made of plastic.  Emitters are made of soft-touch-plastic, quite pleasant to the touch.  Thanks to the non-slip surface, the headphones are easily inserted and removed from the ear. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bc8/88d/341/bc888d3417c5baec89e4e363e3029644.jpg"><br><br>  Headphone wires are symmetrical, but in the place where the wire is divided into left and right, there is an interesting Y-shaped rubber seal that protects the cable from wear, in this place it often happens.  Interesting and color transition.  The cable is red, the rubber seal is orange, and the wires to the radiators are yellow.  Hipsters will be happy. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/306/49f/1e8/30649f1e88eaee83ceafea8f8bed6164.jpg"><br><br>  The control unit is slightly bulky and the buttons are tight.  But you can adapt yourself.  It is also covered with rubber and looks in the style of all headphones. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/50d/e23/356/50de2335678b1fc0a5b88d435d0f9697.jpg"><br><br>  Angle plug, which is often convenient, but here, again, an amateur.  I love straight lines.  The sound is pleasant and corresponds to the declared characteristics.  Bass saturated and tops sound good.  I didn‚Äôt have any complaints about the received sound, they did their best in Ayayay to fame. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ee5/2d8/0a4/ee52d80a4b36b455d80a542ff651829f.jpg"><br><br>  These ‚Äúears‚Äù are worth 3,310 rubles.  For many, the price will seem high, but the Apple headset (not in the form of droplets, but in the form of plugs) costs about the same.  That's just the sound quality in Aiaiai Pipe Fool is much better, at least, I couldn‚Äôt listen to what the headphones of the apple company give out, too many rattles, high frequencies are cut, and there is practically no bass.  So they are obviously worth their money, you will not be disappointed, and they look fashionable, but it‚Äôs customary to pay for style. <br><br><h4>  <a href="http://goodlocal.ru/catalog/items/akg/akg_k_350_white/">AKG K350</a> </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0e5/7c3/a86/0e57c3a862a27f276ebc85b90b8e127b.jpg"><br><br><ul><li>  Frequency range: 12 - 23500 Hz </li><li>  Impedance: 16 ohms </li><li>  Sensitivity: 121 dB / V </li><li>  Maximum power: 20 mW </li></ul><br>  I chose these headphones, firstly, because the name of the AKG company is familiar from ancient times, when I was fond of making music, and secondly, because they look beautiful, but not defiant. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/288/538/1ad/2885381ad48568d1d892ae2270011bee.jpg"><br><br>  Included is a convenient case for storing the headset.  Well, ambyushurs of different sizes, of course. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/498/e0b/737/498e0b73705d3a872c7391bf06a8e354.jpg"><br><br>  In my opinion, there is a little too big control unit, at least with such small headphones you want and miniature from the remote. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0f2/841/e88/0f2841e88081d39a53836ebbfb2093f1.jpg"><br><br>  The very shape of the headphones is very comfortable.  But this is a purely individual matter, someone may not like it.  My headphones did not fall out of the ear and did not stick out, smoothly curving right at the edge of the auricle. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/745/04f/fb8/74504ffb8ba5bbc29959a62408ce6c48.jpg"><br><br>  The sound of these babies surprised me.  Even looking at the frequency range, it is clear that they have an offset towards the bass.  But the high ones are muffled, but just enough to remove the whistle and annoying rattling, but leave the vocals and other delights that are completely unbeatable without the high frequencies.  If you like heavy metal, then this is the best choice of headset that you can find, I think. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/336/9a8/5d6/3369a85d63759cc57b2844770c64ca2d.jpg"><br><br>  The price of these headphones is approaching 2000 rubles, which is quite good.  Given the quality of sound, as well as the appearance and convenience of these headphones, this cost is very much in line with them.  Needless to say, for the same money you can buy a regular Apple headset. <br><br>  PS AKG headphones even Putin likes.  Well it is, retreat. <br><br><img src="http://www.rue89.com/files/20081215Ecoutes.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  <a href="http://goodlocal.ru/catalog/items/t_jays/t_jays_four/">t-jays four black</a> </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/456/dee/605/456dee605fe05ba95e7f70e0405732a5.jpg"><br><br><ul><li>  Frequency range: 15 - 25 000 Hz </li><li>  Impedance: 16 ohms </li><li>  Sensitivity: 98 dB / V </li><li>  Maximum power 20 mW </li></ul><br>  These headphones, in the first place, caught my attention with their appearance.  This headset even has an unusual box and you need to think a bit to open it.  The look of the headphones is so unusual that I didn‚Äôt even understand from the picture how such a whopper could fit in the ear. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/258/ee4/680/258ee46809ca9c5adbaa0867e9418d0d.jpg"><br><br>  As it turned out, maybe, but not too comfortable.  I may have small ears, but it was not very convenient for me to listen to music through this headset.  Here is a big part of it rests in the ear and causes discomfort. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9fa/8d1/2f0/9fa8d12f0357d6f9a0731464079e33e8.jpg"><br><br>  Headphones look beautiful, but the control unit was surprised.  It is small and simple, but convenient, and this is important.  Perhaps this is the best control unit of all that are presented today in the review.  Sound insulation is not at the highest level.  To listen to music in the subway, you have to unscrew the sound to the maximum. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e67/5fa/f66/e675faf66c9c86054bcc83c66da81196.jpg"><br><br>  But the sound from the headphones is excellent.  Especially the bass, they are good on the ears.  True, because of this a bit muffled high frequencies.  But if you want to listen to Rammstein or some kind of knocking trance, then these headphones will fit unambiguously.  But to listen to Mozart, I would choose something else. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/45b/fa6/4ec/45bfa64ec8ff245c3eab8cad21471190.jpg"><br><br>  The cost of these headphones is 2900 rubles.  I believe that this is a slightly overpriced price for such bulky radiators and not very convenient wire.  But in the complete set there is a convenient box, and the sound quality of the ‚Äúears‚Äù is decent.  Well, then, this is a good price for the fact that people on the streets will pay attention to you, but I would not buy these. <br><br><h4>  <a href="http://goodlocal.ru/catalog/items/klipsch/klipsch_image_s4i_white/">Klipsch Image S4i</a> </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/297/04b/b18/29704bb188d38db84c8acb15bd719c91.jpg"><br><br><ul><li>  Frequency range: 10 - 19000 Hz </li><li>  Impedance: 18 ohms </li><li>  Sensitivity: 110 dB / V </li><li>  Maximum power: 19 mW </li></ul><br>  This is the most expensive and perhaps the most interesting headset of all presented.  In general, they say that these headphones were specially made for Apple products and even sold at the Apple Store. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/920/977/c84/920977c84a6eb19dc539b7f191f46590.jpg"><br><br>  The emitters are made of high quality plastic.  Their form is interesting and incomprehensible at first glance, but then you understand why this is done.  The thing is that these headphones almost do not touch the ear, that is, only the rubber tip is in contact.  This is very convenient, especially when you consider their low weight. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1b4/aeb/f9b/1b4aebf9b60e98cf1437fcc17a87cd49.jpg"><br><br>  From the first time it is almost impossible to guess, you hold the left or right earpiece in your hands, but over time you get used to it and discern by bending in one direction or another. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a9d/47f/8c1/a9d47f8c17f5065bb3a5ad3785c32154.jpg"><br><br>  Interesting and control panel.  It is miniature, it has three buttons to control the volume and pause.  To use it is very convenient.  By the way, fully buttons work only with Apple devices.  Although I didn‚Äôt have any problems with Samsung SGS III, the manufacturer doesn‚Äôt talk about it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a57/5d7/be0/a575d7be0f14971f4ccc5669c5694ac6.jpg"><br><br>  The sound of the headset is gorgeous.  Much better than what Apple branded headsets give out.  Yes, the bass is slightly oiled and they do not reach all the upper frequencies.  But this is more an error than a serious flaw.  I am sure that non-professionals will not even notice it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/17c/e51/c1e/17ce51c1ec529c981ac1fd8b90eb1894.jpg"><br><br>  The relative disadvantage of this headset is the price of 4890 rubles.  Not every audiophile will be ready to pay almost 5 thousand rubles for some headphones.  But to be honest, if I could, I would buy them.  They are comfortable, they have good sound and a convenient remote control.  And they have such a style, alien, well, and the metal box is captivating. <br><br><h4>  Results </h4><br>  The best, in my opinion, is the headset Klipsch Image S4i.  These ‚Äúears‚Äù have a good design, they are made in Hi-tech style and look unusual.  I liked how they sit in my ears, at least with me.  The landing is not too deep, but the ambushurs do not fall out, which is the most important.  Yes, it changes with different nozzles, but there are headphones with such a structure that, as you do not change these nozzles, it still makes you feel sick, or they always strive to jump off.  The sound of this headset is very, very good.  There is, however, a slight flaw in the bass, at least in comparison with the others, but they are perfectly insulated from external sounds, so it is difficult for them to find a replacement in the metro. <br><br>  Alas, the cost of these headphones is quite high and not everyone can afford them.  For me, this is also an important criterion, therefore, in terms of price / quality ratio, I chose a proven AKG company and K350 headphones.  The bass and the tops of them are well heard, and the design is cute.  While I still choose, but most likely I will stop the choice on them. <br><br>  I express my gratitude to the store <a href="http://goodlocal.ru/">GoodLocal.Ru</a> for giving the headphones a try and deciding for themselves which is better. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/151651/">https://habr.com/ru/post/151651/</a></p>
