  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Pirate vs Copywriter</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  S.Klebanov: You are depriving people of their earnings by downloading music, movies, books, programs from the Internet. <br>  A.Sherstnev: Nobody forced these people to share their property with other people. <br>  S.Klebanov: However, there is a copyright that prohibits the distribution of certain intellectual information for free. <br>  A.Sherstnev: The owner has acquired some content.  After the transfer of information from the first owner to the second, the second becomes the full owner of this information.  So the second can distribute their property, if they wish. <br>  S.Klebanov: Information belongs to the first owner, the second owner violates the property rights of the first. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  A.Sherstnev: It is not.  Information was voluntarily sold or transferred by the first owner to other people.  There was a voluntary distribution of certain property.  So that no one possesses the fruits of your labor - do not share them.  However, you voluntarily shared them, making the owners of your information someone else. <br>  S.Klebanov: But what about ordering you to earn numerous writers, directors, actors, actors? <br>  A.Sherstnev: These are not my problems.  If they want to keep certain ideas or certain information in secret, then it was worth keeping these ideas and information secret.  To be, so to speak, the sole proprietors of their ideas and their information. <br>  S.Klebanov: What do you think copyright is then? <br>  A.Sherstnev: Monopolistic privilege. <br>  S.Klebanov: Yes ?!  Just like that?  What is the monopoly? <br>  A.Sherstnev: The fact that the owner, when receiving certain information, for some reason, loses the right of ownership of this information, although it was voluntarily sold or transferred from the first person to other persons.  Monopoly is that people who acquire or receive a certain benefit are denied ownership of this benefit by monopoly-privileged power.  People are obliged to acquire certain information only from one distributor. <br>  S. Klebanov: But this is not entirely monopolistic, because  There are numerous distributors operating illegally. <br>  A.Sherstnev: They act legally, making the cost of some information or products very cheap.  "Rightholder" is trying to get people to buy products only from him.  Thanks to the patronage of the state or international officials, the price of such a product will always be high.  Owners who have received information from the first person, sharing it with someone, bring down the cost of content.  This is not like the monopolists. <br>  S. Klebanov: Are you a communist? <br>  A.Sherstnev: No.  I'm a libertarian. <br>  S.Klebanov: Strange.  Libertarians have always been for copyright. <br>  A. Sherstnev: Many people who consider themselves libertarians were not familiar with the works of Rothbard.  When they get acquainted with them, many things become clear to them.  The same applies to the monopoly privilege called "copyright". <br>  S.Klebanov: I just recently argued with one Marxist.  He seemed to be from the so-called pirate party. <br>  A.Sherstnev: You simply did not argue with a libertarian. <br>  S. Klebanov: It is possible.  On this, perhaps, finish.  You did not convince me. <br>  A.Sherstnev: Life will convince.  All the best. </div>
