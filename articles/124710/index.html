I glanced at the notification tray, where I saw a completely unfamiliar icon and text about the following content: ‚ÄúThe best games online!  Free download ‚Äù, after which the text went beyond the allotted 480 px and hid the further essence of the sentence. <br><br>  - Hmm, I did not see anything like that, let's come here, see what it is.  - then it seemed to me that this was a notification from some application, which I can easily identify in the list of running programs, finding unknown and suspicious software, but this was not the case.  Clicking on the notification caused the opening of the browser with the transition to the typical java garbage games.  There was nothing to watch there, and since the notification was gone, I didn‚Äôt see the point of picking around with the phone. <br><br>  - I do not know, it seems that now I can‚Äôt help you with anything, let's try to rummage the next time the notification appears again.  - I left it on that, only yesterday I discovered this in the tray, and here it was already a matter of principle to figure out who the brazen was that he allowed himself not to advertise, but to send spam.

Join NOW!  - Called the text content of the notification. <br>  The list of running programs and services consisted only of trusted or purchased applications, so I ended up being driven into Google. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bff/5cb/2b0/bff5cb2b097c4dc1d846000ce34918a6.jpg" align="left">  First, I threw the cry on Twitter, no one responded.  The problem is rare, I thought, because even more interesting. <br>  The letters have already filled the search line - <em>advertisement in notification bar android</em> .  Bingo, the very first link to androidforums reveals all the secrets, interspersed with <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/gzdz6/i_as_a_developer_hate_the_idea_of_airpush_lets/">angry English-speaking curses</a> towards this technology. <br><br>  And the technology of such ‚Äúunobtrusive‚Äù advertising is called <a href="http://www.airpush.com/">‚ÄúAirPush‚Äù</a> . <br>  The enemy has been identified, it remains to understand, to the developer of what application I have installed, has such a bright idea occurred to me?  And here again, reading a long thread on reddit helped out, where one comrade shared a link to the application in the market with the uncomplicated name <a href="https://market.android.com/details%3Fid%3Dcom.brosmike.airpushdetector">AirPush Detector</a> . <br>  The application does exactly what is required of it - displays a list of programs installed on your phone that use AirPush for monetization.  Install, run ... Profit. <br><br>  I expected that there would be some sad left application installed unconsciously, but no.  KinoDroid, which has a 4+ rating in the market, with thousands of installations and positive reviews, decided to earn even more from its free version.  Well, I respect the work of the developers and buy the software that I really use, KinoDroid ran a couple of times, I did not think about the paid version, and there was no point in deleting it, but exactly until the moment when its monetization scheme didn‚Äôt exceed the reasonable edge. <br>  Agree, when you see the ad unit at the bottom of the application, you understand who hung it there, you understand why and you see it only when you use the application. <br>  When you do not understand who, do not understand how your tray begins to terrorize - this is disgusting and disrespect for the user.  I consider it absolutely valid to put 1 star in the rate to the application, which I did, and what I would never do, while watching the usual ad unit at the bottom of the screen of the free application launched. <br><br>  As for the application that spammed the heroine of the introduction to the topic, then, ironically, it turned out to be the application My Mood, with one of the developers of which she is personally acquainted.  Even more interesting is the fact that recently the developers of this application wrote a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/android_development/122738/">topic on Habr√©</a> , in which they analyzed application monetization schemes and even compared the godless AirPush in comparison.  According to them, they abandoned this method, whereas just a week ago, Natasha showed me the first time that an ad hit the tray. <br><br>  In summary, I would like to wish application developers to be more careful in choosing means of monetization.  There is nothing more expensive than loyal users, and AirPush is more likely a tool for their mass shooting.  Do not chase for super-profit, it is short-term and will rather bury your application than make it successful. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/124710/">https://habr.com/ru/post/124710/</a></p>
