  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Show us the code, Mr. Ballmer</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Site <a href="http://showusthecode.com/">Show Us The Code</a> was born on Sunday morning and immediately demanded justice from the world.  He was heard very quickly, by lunchtime, and now Steve Ballmer (Steve Ballmer) has another reason to sweat thoroughly.  Why him?  Because the home page of this site contains an open letter to the vice president of Microsoft with the requirement to show the very pieces of code in the Linux kernel that supposedly implement the ideas patented by the company. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The creators of SUTC, apparently convinced Linuxers, finally want to get Ballmer to answer for his words.  Let me remind you that the second person at Microsoft has twice stated that Linux violates their intellectual property.  Both times he based on this the company's desire to make a deal with Novell and warned users of a free OS to look more often and be ready for massive lawsuits from the Redmond giant. <br><br>  Such a method of gaining competitive advantage shocked even the leadership of Novell, the manufacturer of the SUSE distribution, which Ballmer generously declared free from legal prosecution.  However, few people seriously believed the novelists. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      I will give the most juicy quotes from the letter: <br><br><blockquote>  We are impressed by the fact that you want to work with the open source community.  After all, it was about this agreement with Novell, right?  Here is your chance. </blockquote><br><br><blockquote>  Linux community members don't want your code.  We do not want litigation.  We do not want non-free code.  And in addition, to your dismay, we especially don‚Äôt want the Microsoft code. </blockquote><br><br>  In a separate appeal to IT celebrities (Stallman, Brin, Page and Schmidt, Torvalds, Shuttleworth, Carmoni and Sulik), as well as to everyone and every Linux developer around the world who feel threatened by Microsoft, the authors of the letter encouraged them to participate in Campaigns to search for those pieces of code themselves.  The campaign will last until May 1. <br><br>  Anticipating in advance that this appeal will not remain unanswered and most likely thousands of people will want to provide such ‚Äúhelp‚Äù to Microsoft, the authors ask: <br><br><blockquote>  How many corporations, how many organizations, how many community members will respond to this to discover your bluff, Stephen? </blockquote><br><br>  In the case, if the illegal code is still found, it can be quickly rewritten, perhaps even if it has to abandon the support of such controversial technologies as the FAT file system, for which MS has two patents (but not one) .  If not - Ballmer will be confounded by arguments.  It looks like it will win Open Source anyway.  Therefore, Ballmer‚Äôs most likely reaction is silence and disregard. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/3614/">https://habr.com/ru/post/3614/</a></p>
