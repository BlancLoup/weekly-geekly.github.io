  <section class="page js-page"><h1>CodeIgniter based CMS - current situation</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The other day I needed to install an engine for an English-language blog.  The problem is that hosting (VPS with 256 MB of memory) does not pull WordPress version 2.6, and in 2.0.11 (which, perhaps, would work), not all the plug-ins I need work.  In general, I decided to see what light CMSs exist now, moreover, based on CodeIgniter, as the fastest and most memory-consuming PHP framework.  I have rather simple functional requirements: the possibility of blogging, preferably with SEO-tricks (writing titles, meta tags, generating Google Sitemap). <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  For a start, two CMS, which I did not consider as possible solutions: <br><br>  <a href="http://max-3000.com/">MaxSite CMS</a> is a Russian-language CMS, which <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/MaxSite/40922/">I already wrote about</a> .  I will say right away that this is the most advanced CMS on CodeIgniter out of all those listed in this review, but for me in this task it did not fit for one reason - its Russian-speaking, but more on that later.

      <a href="http://expressionengine.com/">ExpressionEngine</a> is a great CMS that has a lot of fans, and it‚Äôs also created by the same people as CodeIgniter himself.  But, first, the current version (1.6.5) is not implemented for CodeIgniter (the developers plan to switch to CI only in version 2), and secondly, the license for its commercial use is paid ($ 249.95), and I use the personal free version I can not. <br><br>  So, what options are there from what I managed to find: <br><br>  <a href="http://blaze.haughin.com/">Blaze</a> - this project seems to have already died, at least the latest system news dates from April 2008.  But he became the ancestor of several other CMS, which are discussed below.  I did not manage to make this system work normally.  Virtually any action occurred errors with links, both using mod_rewrite, and without it. <br><br>  <a href="http://speedovation.com/">Blogmer</a> - honestly, I could not even deliver this CMS, I did not find the index.php file in the root directory in the distribution kit.  An attempt to substitute a file from CodeIgniter itself did not lead to success.  There is no information about installing the package. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.vevmedia.net/blog/work/2008/09/29/code-ignited-cms-v/">Shanti CMS</a> - an attempt to start the system gives an error syntax MySQL, there are no instructions for installing the system <br><br>  <a href="http://ci-cms.blogspot.com/">CI-CMS</a> - this project seems to be quite lively, at least the author periodically lays out his work in SVN (latest fixes - October 23).  The system is based on Blaze, positioned as "modular" (so far there are only kernel modules, such as "blog", "page", etc.).  I put it easy, I could enter the admin area.  But the thing is that I didn‚Äôt manage to find a way to publish materials (blog and pages) in the admin panel.  Perhaps the problem is in the browser, and you need to use IE (I have FF), but I didn‚Äôt check it already :) <br><br>  <a href="http://inktype.org/">InkType</a> is the only fully working CMS of the listed.  It‚Äôs easy to install, I easily adapted one of the simple WordPress templates for it.  But there is little sense in this: there are only 4 widgets in the system for the sidebar - recent posts, search, categories and blogroll, there is no tag support in posts, and, in general, the functionality is very poor.  Let's hope that it will develop, the latest version of the system - September 7, 2008. <br><br><h5>  findings </h5><br>  1. I did not find a pure solution to the problem. <br><br>  2. InkType is the only CMS considered that can be used, but only with very modest requirements for functionality. <br><br>  3. The only way out at the moment is to use MaxSite CMS, but you have to think how to translate it into English, although it is probably not that difficult. <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/43401/">https://habr.com/ru/post/43401/</a></p>
