And I talk about the top, about the perfection of managerial skills from my point of view. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Positive Management - The Basics </h4><br><br>  It is given to us, managers, to manage the most difficult and impermanent - human resource.  We have 12 basic psycho-types, cyclicality regardless of gender, and just external influence ‚Äî the environment where we are now. <br><br>  We have in our arsenal a voice, so they can and should be used professionally.  A true manager should be able to: what, when and how to tell the other party. <br><br>  For example, there is some one positive / negative conditional parameter - even if we have a mood of +100, and all if we communicate with a person who has a mood of -30, we will eventually get a positive result in 70. And another manager with a mood in +20, when communicating with the same person, will get a negative value at -10.  Those.  with one approach, two different results. <br><br>  Accordingly, the external environment and in particular this very person is -30, they are not subject to us and we cannot influence this.  BUT, it does not mean that nothing can be done - we have a lot of opportunities to change ourselves.  How?  If it is interesting - I will tell in the next posts. <br><br>  I also want to note that in management, emotional credibility (ECD) is very important, and this account goes to every person-to-person relationship, i.e.  I have an EKD with Vanya positive, then I can ask him to do something that is more important to me than him.  But, if this loan is zero or negative, then it will not do anything for me at all. <br><br>  Conclusion - ECD should be replenished with each person.  Each person has EKD Vasya, Petit, Masha, etc.  with everyone they have ever seen and there is an EKD by default.  In order for the task to be assigned not to be very ‚Äúexpensive‚Äù for EKD, it is imperative to ask politely and say thank you - this is very important.  And secondly, you need to take care of your subordinates, if they ask for something, try to do it - to replenish your EKD with them.  Interestingly more?  - write comments - I will reveal psychology. <br><br>  Accordingly, in order for the same instruction / task to be fulfilled, it is necessary to formulate it interestingly and choose the correct method of submission.  There are many theories here, but practice nowhere without practice. <br><br><h5>  1. Ways to encourage / punish employees. </h5><br>  Since the main motivation of a person is the work itself.  Each person seeks to create something to leave behind, or to do something useful for others. <br><br>  It turns out that each person needs to be given tasks according to his level of abilities and qualifications, and to control as much as his level of self-management allows him to work independently.  If its level of self-management is 70%, then we supplement the remaining 30% ourselves.  And we try to bring the person up to 100% in order to only give him tasks, set priorities and get results.  Someone is not able to control himself because of the natural features, but a very good spec, well, you already know this and are ready to compensate for the sake of the overall result. <br><br>  Resume - encourage and punish the need to work. <br><br><h5>  2. Non-material motivation system </h5><br><br>  Motivation is a very big topic.  To begin with, 95% of people want to work well initially.  The remaining 5% - you must screen out at the interview stage immediately.  And those who do not fit your company / team / you personally at the DNA level, you need to identify on probation.  Remember that skill and qualifications can be quickly tightened, but not controllability with this is more difficult, so if a person immediately argues with you is not argued and generally does not behave adequately, then it is better not to work with this. <br><br>  Remember that the same specialist may work poorly for you, while another manager works very well on the same job (on the contrary, it also works).  I observed it many times in my own experience, therefore ... correctly, we draw conclusions and change ourselves, if necessary, so that such people can work with you. <br><br>  In general, the more different managers you have, the more people out of these 95% percent can work with you.  It reminded me of the sales funnel - I will describe it in one of the following articles. <br><br>  On motivation, I will give this advice: In order for a person to perform a task better, give him a bit of responsibility for some piece of work.  People love that they are trusted. <br><br>  And also everyone wants to be unique - tell them first about some news in the company in confidence.  For example, about the upcoming corporate event, or ask an employee for advice on some issue - this will show that you are a human too. <br><br>  Here's another interesting trick came to mind - a person acquires the qualities that you yourself and gives him, and this helps to achieve the desired result.  And it should be true. <br><br>  For example, ‚ÄúYou are such a guru in Bitrix, only you can do this integration at the weekend, because on Monday we will go to a cool client ...‚Äù By the way, the hostess has a note - if any request is made and the phrase ‚Äúbecause‚Äù then it immediately significantly increases the likelihood of its implementation, while reducing the value for EKD. <br><br><h5>  3. How to increase employee interest (especially for those who just do not care) </h5><br><br>  If you already have people who don't give a damn, it means that you need to find out what the matter is.  Discuss with each person personally why he doesn‚Äôt want to do what is needed and what you can do to make it work as you need. <br><br>  Yes, there may be an option that the person has already burned down, the company is scoring, the boss is a fool and all that - part with such a person, give him an honest positive recommendation.  This will be mutually good.  The mechanism for key and linear people should be different and it is always necessary to evaluate the price to return the person to the building and his values ‚Äã‚Äãas a specialist. <br><br>  Maybe he just scrolled at the mouse broke or comp.  began to slow down.  Get honest feedback from everyone - you will find out a lot of interesting things.  And also periodically find out how you are doing.  If you are not interested in people and their experiences, then you will not be interested in them either.  And since you are the manager, then this initiative is yours to start and maintain. <br><br>  I have such a principle - I do not punish the truth.  For repeated mistakes, the employee himself offers the options of punishment for himself, and already I choose.  Those.  if a person broke something, then he must immediately (!) come in and personally say that he broke - then he will not be punished.  It is known that the cost of an error grows over time - thus I get all the errors at once and I have the opportunity to quickly solve the problem, until it becomes a disaster.  There is one nuance here, if someone else found your mistake, and you knew it and hid it - then see point 1 of the encouragement and punishment. <br><br>  Praise people more often, but not just like this: ‚ÄúYou are well done, everything is fine.‚Äù  Specifically, ‚ÄúIt's great that you managed to make the headlight cleaning module by Friday,‚Äù ‚ÄúThank you for stopping later and helping to figure out the problem with the windmill project,‚Äù etc. <br><br>  How to scold correctly - read below. <br><br><h5>  4. Is it worth it to further punish the support department if they already rule the bugs? </h5><br><br>  There were such opinions: <br>  <i>And how do you think the ‚Äútechnical support department (TP)‚Äù should be punished (we finish and modify the sites, we have 70% of the work - editing other people's bugs)?</i> <i><br></i> <br><br>  <i>It is not the first time that I have met such an opinion, they say, it is prestigious to DONE, but bug fixing is an ungrateful slave labor.</i>  <i>Why?</i> <i><br></i> <br><br>  Firstly, any work is just work, and the question is how it relates to this.  If you have a TP, then you need to focus on the speed of closing these bugs.  Turn it into a game, give titles - Bagolov weeks, etc.  Although for others, all this TP work may already be a punishment. <br><br>  Then, usually through TP grow specialists, they immediately begin to learn the system and encoding rules.  They see all the errors and what they are, respectively, can introduce proposals to the corporate programming standard, which all must comply. <br><br>  You can also give the TP department the powers of control and testing, so that they can test the new code and ‚Äúdrive‚Äù super specialists according to company standards.  This will be the same double benefit - in improving the quality of the product and in the mutual learning of the team. <br><br><h5>  6. How to show people on their mistakes? </h5><br><br>  <b>The Golden Rule: Scold tete-a-tete, praise with the team.</b> <br><br>  A person can never be scolded: ‚ÄúYes, you always make bugs,‚Äù ‚Äúwhat can you do if you have a DNA error?‚Äù, ‚ÄúTanya is better programmer than you from the reception desk‚Äù, etc.  - this is a dead end option right away. <br><br>  It is necessary to act with an open question: ‚ÄúWhy do you think that the button should be on the right?‚Äù, ‚ÄúHow do you think, how should I set the task so that it will be done the next time?‚Äù, Etc. <br><br>  Just do not be afraid to show your weaknesses - it brings people together.  For example: ‚ÄúMy gendir requires that we open a personal account on the site on Thursday, and we still have work until Saturday.  What do you think we can do? ‚ÄùOr‚Äú I need these tedious reports in order to understand what is being done and provide the management with a report in such a way that we can calculate the labor costs for each task / project.  Do you think that the report I proposed will make such statistics?  When it will be easier for you to fill it in - at the end of the day or update it after each completed task during the day. ‚ÄùEtc. <br><br>  - As usual - the following relevant article will be written on the basis of your comments. <br>  Thank you all, who read to the end - I hope there was something useful here that you can immediately apply in the professional or personal sphere. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/146774/">https://habr.com/ru/post/146774/</a></p>
