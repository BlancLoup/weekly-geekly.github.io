Thus, there was only Transcend, which I purchased, and, I will tell you, I was very pleased and will now tell you why. <br><img title="P1230462" src="http://img686.imageshack.us/img686/6336/p1250522.jpg" alt="P1230462"><br>  He pleased me at once with several things: <br><ol><li>  Built-in USB, which allows not to carry with them the wires. </li><li>  The presence of all the parameters described earlier, but about them in more detail later. </li><li>  Ability to use as a USB flash drive (see point 1) </li><li>  Simple navigation menu. </li></ol><br>  For such sizes and prices, I believe, perfect. <br>  Well, now in more detail about each aspect and more pictures from different angles. <br>  So, buying this wonderful device you get just such a box.  Because  You can't call it a box, it's very tiny. <br><img title="File0872" src="http://img5.imageshack.us/img5/1637/file0872.jpg" alt="File0872"><br>  Its contents do not look any specific.  Unless, the rope for carrying on a neck pleased. <br>  <strong>The composition of the box</strong> : player, instructions, minidisk with instructions and drivers, headphones, rope

    <img title="File0873" src="http://img686.imageshack.us/img686/9348/file0873.jpg&quot;"><br>  Well, by tradition, let's start with the technical specifications. <br><br><img src="http://img686.imageshack.us/img686/5351/91554137.jpg"><br><br>  But let's move on from technical pedantry to user experience. <br><h3><img title="File0876" src="http://img714.imageshack.us/img714/1362/file0885.jpg"></h3><br><h3>  Design and buttons </h3><br>  As you can see in the photo, the player looks like a black ‚Äúbrick‚Äù.  Fingerprints are visible, even if you have not touched it.  Scratching is not much. <br>  There is nothing special in design, but there are two things that are not noticeable at first glance: <br><ol><li>  ‚ÄúHole‚Äù reset-a.  If the player hangs, you can restart. </li><li>  Disguised display, which is not visible if the player is turned off. Just a USB flash drive with buttons. </li></ol><br>  To control, we are given 4 buttons (left-right-top-bottom) and a select button, also known as Play / Pause. <br>  Also, there is a lock lever from accidental pressing Hold, the Rec button and the exit button to the previous menu (it also calls up the file directory) <br><img title="P1250534" src="http://img686.imageshack.us/img686/6589/p1250534.jpg" alt="P1250534"><br>  In size, and indeed, in appearance, this device is very similar to a flash drive.  After all, really, Usb, cap, eyelet for lace.  What else is necessary for happiness?  But, this is still a player, and then I will tell you why, but for now you can see its comparison with a flash drive. <br><img title="P1250540" src="http://img714.imageshack.us/img714/5011/p1250540.jpg" alt="P1250540"><br>  Oh yeah, the buttons are initially pretty tight, but quickly developed.  So, with this problem should arise.  After 2 days of use, everything is in order. <br><h3>  So after all, is it a player? </h3><br>  Yes, yes, and yes again!  This is a real player.  And it works just as well as its great fellows, and in some places even better (for example, there is no voice recorder and radio in the iPod) This is exactly the player.  Not a media center, but a player.  If you do not need to play on the road or read books from the screen of your ‚Äúlittle animal‚Äù, and you just want to enjoy the music - this is what you need. <br><br>  <strong>About the sound: the</strong> sound is decent, quality.  Of course, Apple and Cowon are far away, but Transcend walks quite confidently.  Noise was observed, the bass is playing.  There are built-in EQ modes, which are quite suitable for an inexperienced user. <br>  <strong>On the recording thereof:</strong> you can record about 90 hours of chatter on the recorder.  (It is enough to record lectures for the entire semester.) A bit of noise still records, but not critical.  Reproduces pretty clean. <br>  <strong>About radio:</strong> standard receiver interface.  Wave and the ability to choose from the recorded stations. In total, you can record 20 stations.  Pleased that you can record the track from the radio in the player's memory. <br>  <strong>About headphones:</strong> Throw out and buy any in return.  It seems that the headphones were bought for 20p.  On the market.  I did not even listen to them. <br><br>  <strong>About the screen:</strong> Excellent bright display.  Really like.  Everything is clearly visible even in the light of the sun. <br><img title="P1250558" src="http://img707.imageshack.us/img707/4328/p1250558.jpg"><br>  <strong>About Usb:</strong> and Usb it in Africa Usb.  Everything is elementary.  Connected, copied, disconnected, listen.  The transfer rate is pretty decent (about 10 Mbps) <br>  In general, the average version of the budget player.  One of the cheapest and quality players.  It has undeniable advantages, which overshadow the disadvantages in the form of terrible headphones included. <br><h3>  And finally, a summary </h3><br>  Pros: <br><ul><li>  8Gb and small size </li><li>  Low price </li><li>  Convenient USB </li><li>  Reset button </li><li>  Media reliability (Transcend warranty) </li><li>  Ability to use as a flash drive. </li><li>  Quite a long time </li><li>  High-quality display </li></ul><br>  Minuses: <br><br><ul><li>  Sometimes the cap flies </li><li>  Does not support many formats (including loseless) </li><li>  Bad headphones </li><li>  Tight buttons </li></ul><br>  Perhaps there are some other disadvantages that I have not yet noticed.  But at the moment I would give the player a rating: <strong>solid 4</strong> . <br>  In my house, he firmly took up the position between the iPod Shuffle and the <a title="iPod classic" href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/apple/80920/">iPod Classic</a> . <br><br><img title="P1250527" src="http://img710.imageshack.us/img710/6708/p1250527.jpg"><br>  I believe that it is irreplaceable if you need to transfer music to someone or any other information.  Moreover, to listen to music on the way. <br>  Here is such a thing.  Well, he will tell you his words of farewell.  =) <br><img title="P1250559" src="http://blog.kuuuzya.ru/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/P1250559-300x107.jpg" alt="P1250559" height="107" width="300"><br><br><br><br>  <a href="http://twitter.com/Kuuuzya">Follow twitter.</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/Kuuuzya"><br></a>  <a href="http//blog.kuuuzya.ru/%3Fp%3D66">Read</a> in a personal blog. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/82042/">https://habr.com/ru/post/82042/</a></p>
