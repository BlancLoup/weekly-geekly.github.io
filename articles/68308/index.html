  <section class="page js-page"><h1>A set of software for students in a private university</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In addition to my main work as a programmer, I also have a small hobby: as an administrator in my native department.  And now, although today is a day off, I went to the university at the request of the head of the department to ‚Äúspread Venda‚Äù on several machines.  In the process of "spreading", I asked myself a small question: what does a modern student of the Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics need, not from life in general, but what software should be in the terminal class?  It‚Äôs not that I never really thought about it, I just didn‚Äôt have enough time to make a list. <a name="habracut"></a>  I will give a train of my thoughts: <br><br><h4>  OS </h4><br>  First, definitely need an operating system.  * nix or Windows?  Here everything depends on the teachers' wishes and on the software they wish to see there.  So, in the presence of the n-th number of licensed copies of Windows XP, we will put it exactly. <br><br><h4>  Office software </h4><br>  Now, perhaps you can go to the software to work with all sorts of electronic document.  And again there is a choice between free and non-free software.  And again we run into a set of disciplines that take place at the faculty.  Specifically, within one of the disciplines there are several lessons on VBA, the implementation of which is built into MS Office.  I think the teachers will not agree to anything else.  So, our choice is MS Office. <br>  Plus, we will put different applications for viewing images, viewing and editing PDF, of which there is a cart and a small cart, both paid and free.

    <h4>  Work with multimedia </h4><br>  Within the framework of some disciplines that are defined in the curriculum, students learn methods of working with images, 3D graphics.  But the snag is that these courses are focused on specific software products, not the methods themselves.  What do we have as a result?  We have: Adobe Photoshop, 3D Studio Max, Corel Draw. <br><br><h4>  Learning the basics * nix </h4><br>  One of the main courses at the faculty is the study of * nix systems, of course, not only in theory, but also in practice.  Now, the most interesting moment is to set * nix a similar system for profit or to push it into a virtual machine.  In order not to create unnecessary problems for themselves, and for the students themselves, it was decided to put the OS on a virtual machine.  For example, the Virtual Box is a fairly simple and functional system.  As the OS itself, you can choose the one that is the easiest to install and work, because there are people who have not even seen Linux in their eyes.  So, we put, perhaps, Ubuntu.  It does not matter which version, because within the course, the practice is to write simple scripts, and not to write complex applications for QT or GTK. <br><br><h4>  Development environment </h4><br>  And now the choice.  We need to put a development environment or several in which we could write applications in the following languages: Pascal, Object Pascal, Prolog, Lisp, C, C ++, C #, VB.  At least, they do not teach more at the faculty.  So, in order. <br><br><h5>  Pascal </h5><br>  This language is known to be very good at learning the basics, many of it are taught at school or in the first year of university.  Much not bothering, perhaps we will put the familiar blue-mouthed TurboPascal to everyone. <br><br><h5>  Object pascal </h5><br>  The only IDE I know, and in which you can write on Object Pascal, is Delphi.  Since our department wanted to get several licenses for Borland Developer Studio 2006, we will install it. <br><br><h5>  Prolog, Lisp </h5><br>  For such languages, I do not know more convenient environments than Visual Prolog and Visual Lisp. <br><br><h5>  C, C ++, C #, VB </h5><br>  So, go to the sweetest.  A number of main languages ‚Äã‚Äãthat are partially covered during the training.  There is a small choice between Visual Studio and SharpDevelop, where there is ‚Äúeverything at once‚Äù.  Strongly without bothering ... we will put this and that, who will like what, then they will use it. <br><br>  Regarding other languages, for example: PHP, Ruby.  Our department is not engaged in them, either the teachers do not want, or something else, but the result is the same. <br><br><h4>  Work with DB </h4><br>  Since the Express Edition 2005 or 2008 MS SQL Server goes by default with Visual Studio, and this is quite enough to create even large projects, this should be enough at the university. <br>  It seems to be all.  If you have forgotten something, please remind me, otherwise in this academic year students will be left without software =) <br><br>  <b>PS</b> <br>  With this topic, I didn‚Äôt want to conduct some kind of comparative analysis of software products, but just wanted to make a list of standard for most educational institutions, including universities, software that is used in the learning process.  It is only necessary for learning the basics, and everything else is already decided by the students themselves =) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/68308/">https://habr.com/ru/post/68308/</a></p>
