"To hell with all of it!  Fight and do it! ‚Äù- and last fall I ordered goods from China, India and Nepal for 1243, 510 and 311 US dollars, respectively, completely unaware of what awaits me when these orders arrive and, as expected, will be detained by customs. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  As expected, I stepped on every possible rake at once :)

      The first order was sent to me by the EMS courier service (I chose them, after reading negative reviews about FedEx in Russia, and the delivery of DHL was significantly more expensive).  The cost of goods + shipping amounted to 1243 USD, which I was offered to pay through‚Ä¶ Western Union.  Western Union is a money transfer from a private person to a private person, and nothing can be written except the ‚ÄúLoot as a gift‚Äù in the purpose of payment.  I was wondering whether to believe in humanity and pay a stranger to the Chinese in this way, and then decided.  A couple of days nervous, I got the number of the air carrier bill: hooray, not deceived!  The order was still sent.  I chose EMS courier delivery because I wanted to receive the order as soon as possible, and the promised 7 days were fine with me.  As a result, the parcel did arrive in 7 days, but I spent another 2 weeks at customs, plus it took me another 1.5 weeks to get her out of customs. <br>  As far as I understood, all international mail arrives at the International Mail Center on Warsaw Highway, 37, where customs officers sitting in the same building inspect them, and either release or do not release further.  As a rule, shipments worth less than 10 thousand rubles go on to their recipients without additional questions, and for parcels worth 10 thousand or more, you must pay a tribute depending on the type of goods lying inside. <br><br>  The experience of communication with postal customs officers was the most terrible.  First, the cost of the order was more than a thousand dollars.  For everything that costs more than a thousand dollars, it is necessary to draw up a CCD (cargo customs declaration).  I want to clarify that what is meant here is not the cost of the goods itself, but the cost of the goods + delivery costs - this is called the customs value, and all taxes are paid from it.  A CCD is impossible for a mere mortal to make up on his own: first, you need to have knowledge and experience where to write, and second, GTDs are drawn up with special software and printed on a matrix printer on a special multi-layered form, which only customs brokers have.  That is, I could not get this order without a broker, whose services for the design of the CCD cost me 4,000 rubles.  At the same time, the customs duty for the goods that arrived arrived at a completely different end of Moscow, only in one window and only during working hours, and I was obliged to appear there on my own.  So, I spent half a day trying to roll up and pay a fee plus VAT (something came out about 12-15 thousand rubles, which doubled the cost price of the goods: I did not know that the duty was paid on the cost of the goods plus the cost of delivery, and I have cost as much as the product itself).  I spent the other half a day to notarize my TIN - when I brought a simple copy to the customs officers, as they had asked before, it turned out that a simple copy must be notarized.  And I allocated a whole weekday (they do not work on weekends), when the broker and I had already collected all the necessary documents and made the CCD to sit near their garret and wait for them to check everything there until they go to dinner, while they chat , while they smoke, while, bye ... I arrived and filed the documents at 9 am, and they gave me the package only at 16. At the same time, the broker, completely wrapped up, all the time ran from them to his computer to fix the comma in the GTD , in what way my beads were made, then what else - they nagged each erun  de, and a broker who has several years of experience behind him, reworked GTE 4 times, I guess.  At the same time, the tone of the conversation was derogatory and they communicated with me as if I were making out 30 kilograms of marijuana and trying to pass it off as dried maple leaves. <br><br>  When I was finally allowed to pick up the parcel, I felt morally devastated, I was still starting to shake, as I begin my adventure to remember, and I will try to make my shipments never again delayed by the post customs. <br><br>  The second order, for 510 dollars, was paid for with a credit card, it was supposed to be sent by the cheapest way by sea ‚Äúto the nearest port‚Äù.  I don‚Äôt know what place I thought at that moment - I never saw my order, and it‚Äôs not clear whether it wasn‚Äôt yet dispatched, sank or lay down in the port closest to Moscow somewhere in Novorossiysk, and it floated back to India :) I could not get the money back, as well as receive any comments from the sender.  If interested, more details about this experience can be found <a href="http://office-free.ru/2008/03/19/import-i-problemy-s-nim-svyazannye-tovar-poteryalsya/">here</a> . <br><br>  Most of all I liked to get an order for 311 dollars from Nepal out of the hands of customs officers.  He arrived at the cargo terminal of one of Moscow airports, and as soon as this happened, they called me and reported it by phone, and also sent a telegram.  These customs officers, unlike the postal ones, work on weekends, are friendly and do not take advantage of every opportunity to poke fun and nerves.  My 8-kilogram box was in no way compared to the usual volumes for this place: the goods arrive in containers, so most likely they therefore treated me very condescendingly and did not commit atrocities.  At the entrance I was given a memo (first go there, then there, then go here and return to step 1 - it was very much like a quest and even a bit interesting). <br>  The order arrived at the airport 2-3 days after it was shipped, and I spent about 3 hours to get it. <br><br>  Summarizing the above: <br><ul><li>  Shipments worth more than $ 1,000 bring more problems than shipments of $ 900; </li><li>  The duty is paid as a percentage of the amount equal (cost of goods + shipping cost)  For each type of goods the duty is different - you can find it in the TN VED (google), or ask a familiar customs broker.  Do not forget to throw 18% VAT - VAT is also paid when importing goods; </li><li>  Think ten times before asking for delivery of an order over 5 thousand rubles by courier service; </li><li>  Find out where the port closest to you is and think twenty times whether to order goods with delivery ‚Äúto the nearest port‚Äù if the nearest port is a thousand kilometers away; </li><li>  As soon as the seller writes that the order has been sent - ask for the airway bill number or scan of transport documents, to reassure; </li><li>  Best of all was when the order arrived at the cargo terminal of the airport; </li><li>  Just in case, you should have with you a notarized copy of the TIN, as well as all the necessary documents: certificate of IP registration, tax registration, invoice, proof of payment of the invoice, contract, passport; </li><li>  Importing and working with foreign suppliers, especially unfamiliar ones, is always a risk.  Contraindicated in those who are too serious about money. </li></ul><br>  I hope my little experience will be useful to someone :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/27158/">https://habr.com/ru/post/27158/</a></p>
