  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Dark prospects for the development of Russian Internet censorship</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This post was inspired by several earlier posts of the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/Mithgol">Mizgol webmaster</a> , who <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/151981/">spoke</a> about the actions of the authorities to block YouTube because of the presence of a video recognized as extremist and earlier posts about the ‚Äúgentlemen‚Äôs‚Äù decisions of the authorities on the phased restriction of access to information online.  I will not touch upon the moral assessment of the prohibition of access to information, let us accept for simplicity of reasoning that any unconditional restriction of access to information in the conditions of modern society should be minimized.  The prospects for the development of censorship by zealous officials are understandable, but so far it has affected only Web 2.0 sites (which are filled with the users themselves), not touching, for example, the entertainment industry, many of them are now online. <br><br>  And how are things going with this, and what is going on in this area?  Immediately I sat down and thought, and set out my thoughts below for all the habores, for joint thinking and commenting. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  As we all know, there are online games in which the game is carried out through the players' computers connected by the international network the Internet.  These are both browser games that work in the players' browsers, and modular, which work is provided by the client and server parts.  I myself played only in <a href="http://godville.net/">Godville</a> (she spends very little human time), but on the wave of modern hype I read a lot about what was going on in them. <br><br>  Yes, let me ... You shouldn't even read the news, just look at the representation of the gaming theme in web 2.0 sites to understand how comprehensive and well-known this once little-known and poorly accessible industry is due to the underdevelopment of computer technologies.  See for yourself: <br><ul><li>  A variety of views on the games are widely represented in the <a href="">Russian blogosphere</a> , and not only.  The presence of any subject in very popular sources is not something strange (it‚Äôs not for nothing that the datemaps of one of the World of Warcraft patches appeared on Reddit, a multilingual social newsletter, which surprised me a lot in some of the moments that interested me yesterday) There are games about lesser known sites: </li><li>  The <a href="http://wikireality.ru/">Wikireality</a> Encyclopedia, which is devoted to the Internet (see, for example, the <a href="http://wikireality.ru/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25BB%25D1%2583%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F:NewPages">latest articles written there</a> ), has several articles that describe some of the points of harm and shortcomings of games, as understood by the authors of these articles: such as <a href="http://wikireality.ru/wiki/%25D0%2591%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B,_%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D1%258B%25D0%25B5_Blizzard">Bans, distributed by Blizzard</a> ; </li><li>  In the Russian nationalist encyclopedia, the Tradition, which puts the interests of the Russian nation above all in its understanding of the authors, and therefore contains only materials that the authors consider useful to the Russian nation - and that appeared in an article about one of the characters from the latest addition to the MMORPG ‚ÄúWorld of Warcraft "By the name" <a href="http://traditio-ru.org/wiki/%25D0%25A2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB_%25D0%25A0%25D0%25B0%25D1%2588%25D0%25B0">Tal Russia</a> "; </li><li>  And not only.  If you look at what is being done on the other hand, we will see that in the Jewish encyclopedia <a href="http://novopedia.net/">Novopedia</a> , one of the main fillers of which is a historian and biologist <a href="http://novopedia.net/wiki/%25D0%2590%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9_%25D0%2597%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B2">Andrei Zelev</a> , who has a negative attitude towards nationalism, and that is, an article entitled ‚Äú <a href="http://novopedia.net/wiki/%25D0%2592%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4_%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582_%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582-%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580">Harm from Internet games</a> , in which an anonymous analyst described how he imagines the effect of games on a person; </li><li>  Even in the public (i.e. public page) ‚Äú <a href="http://vk.com/mudakoff">MDK</a> ‚Äù, which is conducted on the social network ‚ÄúVKontakte‚Äù by a group of anonymous administrators and specializes in distributing several memes to readers and amusing them by posting funny pictures with these memes, usually in the demotivators format - and in that presents the subject of online games, such as <a href="">such a picture</a> . </li></ul>
