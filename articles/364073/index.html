      <b>TOEFL Reading</b> <br><br>  The tasks of the <a href="http://toefl-test.ru/toefl-reading/">TOEFL Reading</a> section assess your ability to understand the basic idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãEnglish-language texts on academic topics. <br><br>  You have to read 3-4 text and answer questions posed to them. <br><br>  Candidates need to answer questions regarding the main idea, details, text output and provide a summary.  In total, 36-56 questions are presented in the section. <br><br>  Reading questions examples <br><br>  - The meaning of the word ‚Äúperspective‚Äù on line 32 is close in meaning to which of the following words‚Ä¶. <br>  - Paragraph 6 supports which of the following statements .... <br>  - Which of the following proposals best reflects the essence of this proposal? <br>  - Based on the data from the text, who conducted research on the effect of magnetic waves on human health? <br>  - Based on paragraph 4, all of the following statements are true, except ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/53f/3c9/a86/53f3c9a86e35482faf63ab5f09a113bc.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Tips for passing the TOEFL Reading section</b> <br><br>  Working with texts TOEFL is quite difficult due to their large volume (up to 700 words), therefore it is important to follow the basic rules for passing tests in this section. <br><br>  Remember that you definitely need to go back to the text to answer the question.  Most often the questions refer you to a specific paragraph or sentence of the text.  Even if there is no direct mention of a section of text (according to ..., in paragraph ...), the question often refers to some piece of information mentioned in a separate paragraph of the text. <br><br>  Please note that test developers in order to confuse you, in the form of answer choices are often offered statements that are essentially true and are mentioned in the text.  However, they often do not answer the question posed and have no relation to it. <br><br>  <b>TOEFL Listening</b> <br><br>  The execution of the TOEFL Listening section is 60-90 minutes. <br><br>  34-51 test assignment aims to evaluate your skills in understanding English spoken language in lectures and dialogues on general topics. <br><br>  Passing on need to listen to audio recordings, the number of which can vary, the following 2 options are most common: <br><br>  - 9 audio recordings - 6 lectures + 3 dialogues; <br>  - 6 audio recordings - 4 lectures + 2 dialogs. <br><br>  In assignments, it is often necessary to determine the topic of conversation, the purpose or attitude of the interlocutors to the problem.  While listening to the recording, you can make notes. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/221/8f7/870/2218f78705774c32b4252654ea93f340.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>TOEFL Listening Tips</b> <br><br>  1. Accents.  Since TOEFL has recently used various accents (British, Australian, American), we recommend that you train to perceive them by ear.  You can hear accents of carriers on special training disks, which are attached to textbooks.  We also recommend listening and watching BBC, CNN, Discovery, Animal Planet and other channels. <br>  2. Intonation.  Learn to distinguish the emotions of people according to their speech, depending on the intonation.  This will help you answer questions on Listening, even if you do not understand individual words in a dialogue or monologue. <br>  3. Vocabulary, idioms, introductory constructions. Continuously replenish your vocabulary, learn new constructions and idioms.  This is useful when listening to records - you will grab the information on the fly. <br>  4. Records. In the Listening section it is not forbidden to take notes.  Therefore, learn to write down key moments: the names of the characters, their roles, their positions, facts, numbers, verbs. <br>  5. Information only.  You should not speculate about the characters, to dream, how they could develop relationships.  Pay attention only to the facts and reported information. <br>  6. Do not be distracted and do not dwell.  Do not try to understand the meaning of individual words, do not try to remember the meaning of these forgotten words.  Otherwise, you risk losing the thread of the discussion. <br>  7. Movies and music.  You can check your listening skills by watching movies without subtitles and listening to songs without viewing texts. <br><br>  <b>TOEFL Speaking</b> <br><br>  Speaking is a TOEFL test section that tests your ability to verbally express your thoughts on a given topic in English. <br><br>  In 20 minutes of TOEFL Speaking you need to answer six simple and integrated questions. <br><br>  The section assesses your ability to clearly and clearly express your thoughts - in simple tasks. <br>  Also in the integrated tasks you will have to read a small excerpt from the text and listen to the recording, after which you need to compile the information received and give an exhaustive answer to the question posed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/937/af1/20f/937af120fe93448798c3de0cde033ffd.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Timing</b> <br><br>  Unlike this section in the <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/tests/test-ielts-obshchaya-informatsiya/">IELTS test</a> , where the examiner communicates directly with the examiner, the feature of the Speaking section is that the answer is dictated to the microphone.  You have only 15 seconds to prepare for an independent task and 30 seconds to prepare for an integrated task response.  45 seconds are allotted for reading. <br><br>  About the same length will be an audio recording for listening. <br><br>  Approximately 45 seconds (independent task) and 60 seconds (integrated task) are given for the answer, after which the recording stops automatically. <br><br>  In general, when examining your notes, examiners pay attention to 4 components: a) disclosure of the topic (presentation logic, development of ideas, examples, facts, details), b) vocabulary (volume of words used and their complexity, use of synonyms), c) presentation of information (fluency, absence of pauses, etc.), d) general impression (correspondence of the answer to the task itself, use in the answer of the information that was given in the task). <br><br>  <b>Tips for working with the Speaking section</b> <br><br>  Of course, Speaking is one of the most difficult sections of the exam for many reasons: a) the presence of a language barrier, b) the absence of the interlocutor, c) a limited amount of time to answer.  However, in the minuses you should always look for pluses.  For example, the absence of an examiner will relieve you of tricky and unexpected questions on his part or of banal subjectivism. <br><br>  Below are some tips on the Speaking section: <br><br>  1. Answer clearly the question asked, do not go into lengthy arguments. <br>  2. Do not make a great introduction.  Because of him, you just do not have time to come to the disclosure of the topic, and your speech will be interrupted in mid-sentence. <br>  3. When preparing for the TOEFL, we advise you to record your answers on a dictaphone, and then listen to the next day, do an analysis, point out your weaknesses, and work on the mistakes. <br>  4. Memorize special words-bundles, introductory words that will help you fill in the pauses between the key components of sentences. <br><br>  <b>TOEFL Writing</b> <br><br>  Writing is the last section of the TOEFL exam.  It takes 50 minutes.  This section consists of two parts: Integrated writing task and Independent writing task.  The volume of the first part is 150‚Äì225 words, the second is at least 300 words.  It will probably surprise someone that in less than an hour it is necessary to write texts of such a volume, but examiners should take into account that the necessary skills can be developed and improved. <br><br>  Many exam <a href="http://toefl-test.ru/uchebniki-toefl/">preparation manuals</a> (for example, issued by Cambridge, Barron's, Delta, Longman) present strategies for organizing the time allotted to the Writing section.  In addition, they publish essay samples, analyze the answers given by the applicants (both successful and ‚Äúfailure‚Äù, estimated low).  To improve your writing skills, it is advisable to work out some time with a teacher who knows the secrets of preparing for the TOEFL well, or sign up for a special preparation program for the exam. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dad/a30/a06/dada30a060cd4c6b84f0d73c3f3b2466.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Integrated writing task</b> <br><br>  Integrated writing task - the first task of the section.  It goes like this: there are 3 minutes to read the passage.  Then he listens to the message associated with it.  It takes 2 minutes.  After that, the applicant starts writing an essay.  This job takes 20 minutes. <br><br>  Completing a complex task will show whether the examinee is able to summarize the material presented to him.  Of course, the answer must demonstrate how the message heard confirms or denies the information contained in the passage read. <br><br>  It is advisable to make any marks already during the reading, although before the applicants are asked to proceed with the direct execution of the task, the passage will reappear.  Instructors also recommend that you briefly record information while listening, since the text is reproduced only once.  Special attention should be paid to explanations and examples that confirm or, on the contrary, cast doubt on the data presented earlier.  Do not think that any details will be superfluous.  When the applicant begins to write, he will understand that it is necessary to use all the information. <br><br>  The candidate must remember that the complex task does not imply the expression of his own opinion.  First of all, it is required to summarize all the material presented.  It is recommended to do only what is specified in the task.  Do not add or subtract anything. <br><br>  <b>Independent essay</b> <br><br>  Independent essay is the second part of the Writing section.  In 30 minutes the applicant must write an essay (4 or 5 paragraphs, approximately 300-350 words), in which he will answer the question asked. <br><br>  You need to have a clear idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat to write.  The task may contain the requirement to agree or disagree with the statement, pick up arguments, clarify something and decide on preferences. <br><br>  The first 5 minutes are best spent writing a plan for a future essay.  Many applicants prefer improvisation (an opportunity to save time plays a significant role in this), however, as practice shows, having a plan allows you to quickly concentrate and formulate thoughts in the best possible way. <br><br>  If you decide on the basic points and come up with examples, the process of writing an essay will become much easier.  Teachers are often advised to refer to the book ‚ÄúHow to Prepare for the TOEFL Essay‚Äù (published by Barron's).  It contains various methods and exercises to make the preparation for the exam as effective as possible. <br><br>  If at the planning stage it turns out that there are not enough arguments to write a qualitative and convincing essay, you should think about the opposite point of view.  The basis of the excellent essay are fresh ideas, interesting examples.  The selected point of view may not coincide with personal opinion, since the task is not to express one‚Äôs own position, but to create a convincing text. <br><br>  Having decided on the point of view, arguments, picking up examples, you should go directly to the text.  It is necessary that the examiner, after reading the first sentences, immediately understood what point of view the applicant adheres to.  If he has to think about it, then the position is not clearly formulated.  Naturally, this is a minus for an essay.  The following paragraphs should contain arguments and examples, in the latter it is necessary to conclude. <br><br>  A good essay always begins with a clear and ‚Äúdecisive‚Äù introduction and ends with a convincing conclusion.  Only in this case it will make a positive impression on the examiner. <br><br>  It is advisable to organize the time in such a way that after writing the essay there will be about 5 minutes to check the work.  Then the applicant will have the opportunity to read the finished text and correct grammatical and / or stylistic mistakes.  This will undoubtedly improve the quality of the essay. <br><br>  In order to successfully complete the task of this section of the Writing section, it is recommended to write an essay in preparation for the exam.  The list of topics is presented on the website <a href="http://www.ets.org/">www.ets.org</a> . <br><br>  <i>The <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/tests/podgotovka-k-toefl/">next publication</a> will discuss the preparation for the TOEFL.</i> <br><br>  The author of the article is Vyacheslav Davidenko, founder of <a href="http://www.mbaconsult.ru/">MBA Consult</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/364073/">https://habr.com/ru/post/364073/</a></p>
