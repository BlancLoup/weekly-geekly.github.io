Training includes unique activities, including social engineering. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Course feature </h2><br>  The uniqueness of the program lies in the symbiosis of the training format (fully distant, not requiring a break from work and study), the quality of the material and the specialized sites on which the training is carried out, allowing you to build the learning process most comfortably and efficiently.

      <i>Service should adapt to the customer, and not vice versa.</i>  <i>Guided by this rule, we abandoned the use of third-party solutions by developing our own training sites, taking into account all the needs of clients: a webinar site, a personal account and a pentest laboratory.</i> <br><br><h2>  Fully distant learning format </h2><br>  Training is carried out remotely, on weekends and in the evening on weekdays, allowing you to gain knowledge without leaving your work or school, as well as receive training from anywhere in the world - this is very convenient.  Today, specialists from different cities and countries (Belarus, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan, etc.) receive the most relevant knowledge in PENTESTIT on the initial ( <b>Zero Security: A</b> ) and professional ( <b>Corporate laboratories</b> ) training programs. <br><br><blockquote>  By the way, there were about 35 people in the group - I made friends with some and we continue to communicate.  And as we all understood - listening to webinars and learning how to search and exploit vulnerabilities are completely different things.  So, only after I passed the laboratory (despite the fact that the course lasts 2 weeks, the curator allocated another week to those who did not have time), I realized how deep the difference between ‚Äúknow‚Äù and ‚Äúknow how‚Äù.  For me, the course was so useful that I, without a doubt, signed up for Corporate Laboratories.  You can tell a lot of things, but it‚Äôs better, as they say, to see once than hear a hundred times.  Separately, thanks to our curator for the constant help and support.  Honestly - I would go again, it's just great!  <i>Igor Vasilyev</i> </blockquote><br><h2>  Only relevant material </h2><br>  The second distinctive feature of the course is relevant material.  Today, information security is changing so dynamically that it is sometimes difficult to keep track of the release of new techniques, tools for finding and operating vulnerabilities.  With each set (once a month and a half), the course is processed, so that students receive the <b>most relevant knowledge and skills at the time of the course</b> . <br><br><h2>  80% practical training </h2><br>  All knowledge gained in webinars is consolidated in a specialized laboratory containing the most popular vulnerabilities and configuration errors under the supervision of a curator accompanying the group throughout the entire learning process.  The main task of the curator is to teach thinking like a hacker.  However, if the assignment fails - the curator will certainly tell the essence of the assignment and help to cope with it.  It is worth noting that an additional advantage of the course is interactivity - ‚Äúlive‚Äù communication both to the instructors and the curator, and group mates.  Practical work in the laboratory is a key factor in obtaining high-quality training and accounts for about 80% of the total training program. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Training program</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><ul><li>  Criminal Code and crimes in the field of information technology; </li><li>  Threat models, their types, objects of research; </li><li>  Familiarity with Linux.
