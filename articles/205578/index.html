      We invite all developers of mobile applications and just interested to continue acquaintance with our service under Habrakat. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  History of creation </h4><br>  We are a young team that develops applications for mobile platforms and with us, like all developers, there came a time when the application code was already fully written and tested, which means it was time to publish the application in the store and start promoting it.  And then the question arose - where to start?  After all, we practically did not have an advertising budget, which means the chances of getting into the TOP applications were close to zero, so we had to carefully study how and where to spend the advertising budget.  It often happened that the money was invested in sources that in the end had no effect on the promotion of the application. <br><br>  But the more applications we got, the easier it was to promote them in the TOP of its category.  We used to catch up with old applications on old applications, and this gave and gives good results - our applications began to rise in the TOP of their category on their own with little or no cash costs (now only on Android, but we are striving for similar on iOS, and in the future on other platforms).  Of course, the TOP category is not a general TOP, but, in our opinion, this is also very good. <br><br>  At one fine moment, the thought came to us that there are many people like us - each mobile application developer faces the problems of promoting their creations.  We thought about it, but what if we share our traffic with other developers and develop a new advertising service for free promotion of applications in central stores?  After all, by joint efforts we will be able to build a platform that will help good and high-quality applications to achieve success. <br><br>  No sooner said than done.  Service <a href="http://startad.mobi/">StartAD.mobi</a> is the embodiment of our idea. <br><br><h4>  So what is this service and what are our goals? </h4><br>  The goal of our service is to help independent developers to facilitate the promotion of their applications and reduce the advertising budget, which is usually not enough. <br><br>  StartAD.mobi is built on the principle of banner-exchange network.  Developers integrate code into their applications and thus advertise applications from each other, which helps them to increase the number of app installations and thereby raise them in the ratings of centralized stores. <br><br><h4>  Another cross-promotion? </h4><br>  Probably everyone now thought, ‚ÄúAnother cross-promotion service?  Fuuu ... "- <b>No.</b> <br><br>  Our system works as a cross-promotion service, but with different mechanics inside, which we have not yet met in similar systems. <br>  For competitors, everything works according to the principle ‚Äúhow many users I brought, I got so much into my applications,‚Äù everything is different with us. <br><br>  <b>Applications connected to StartAD.mobi will receive more traffic than they give themselves</b> .  In more detail we will tell about it in one of the following posts. <br><br><h4>  Our advantages </h4><br><ul><li>  Our system was created to help new applications quickly rise in ratings and get a unique opportunity <b>to</b> reach commercial level for <b>free</b> ; </li><li>  developers can adapt the visual style of ads in the system to the design of their applications; </li><li>  the system has the possibility of ‚Äúexplosive growth‚Äù (we will tell about how it works in the following posts); </li><li>  Our service does not interfere with monetizing the application through adMob, inMobi and similar sites; </li></ul><br><br><h4>  So you can already try your service? </h4><br>  At the moment, we are conducting closed service testing on our applications ‚Äî we improve the mechanics, correct the shortcomings made and collect statistics on the operation of the service as a whole. <br><br>  If you are interested in our project, subscribe to our blog or leave your e-mail on the site <a href="http://startad.mobi/">StartAD.mobi</a> and we will inform you about the launch of the project. <br><br>  And if you decide to participate in the beta testing of the project on one of your applications, then write in a personal (do not forget to tell a little about your application and its attendance at the moment) and we will arrange for you access to the system as far as possible. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/205578/">https://habr.com/ru/post/205578/</a></p>
