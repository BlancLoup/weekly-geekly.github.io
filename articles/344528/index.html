      User Acquisition tendencies are not so bright and optimistic: the number of advertisers is growing with a relatively non-growing mobile advertising market.  Prices to attract new users are growing twice.  In addition, the consumer's information field is overloaded, and it is becoming more and more difficult to gain attention by advertising.  And the user base of many applications and games has long exceeded millions, which means attracting new users is simply problematic. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  If you have already encountered at least one of the above points - it's time to think about retargeting.  Retargeting technology allows you to ‚Äúwake up‚Äù users who have shown interest in your service or have already installed your mobile application.  That is, only those users who somehow interacted with the brand get to the target audience: make a purchase or simply view the offers.  Returning such users is much more profitable than attracting new ones. <br><br>  The success of the retargeting campaign lies in the correct segmentation of the audience.  Segmentation depends largely on the subject and type of business.  Retargeting is effective for any categories of applications that have the opportunity to buy something inside. <br><br><h2>  Common user segments <br></h2><br>  An effective approach to the segmentation of the retargeting campaign is segmentation based on the purchase history and consumer buying behavior.  Users of any service can be divided into 4 categories: <br><br>  1. <b>Active Payer.</b>  It may differ from service to service, but usually it is the user who uses the application regularly and recently made a purchase (at least 30 days ago), or more than one. <br><br>  2. <b>Active defaulter.</b>  This is a user who actively uses the application, but has never made a purchase. <br><br>  3. <b>Sleep payer.</b>  Once upon a time a user made a purchase (more than 30 days ago), but now he either abandoned the application, or sometimes uses it, but does not pay. <br><br>  4. <b>Inactive defaulter.</b>  The largest user base of any user base of any application.  Almost or nothing done in the application.  The most difficult to retarget.  For the price it can manage as the attraction of the new. <br><br>  Each of these generalized segments requires an individual approach and solution.  Consider the segments and approaches to working with them on specific examples of verticals. <br><br><h2>  Segmentation in travel, food delivery service <br></h2><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vx/sg/jt/vxsgjtqoe4tdiou5x1f4uue1mkm.png"><br><br>  The most popular verticals in retargeting. <br><br>  1. Users who have already made a reservation, order or payment in the application.  For each segment below, you can apply filters by prescription, frequency and amount of payment. <br><br><ul><li>  Users who recently made a payment (10, 20, 50 days ago) and are active in recent days.  Solution: you offer them additional services, special offers, special conditions, new items. </li><li>  Users who have made a payment more than 90 days ago and have not shown activity.  Solution: reminder about the existence of the service, special offer, promotional code. </li><li>  Users who have bought for a long time (90 days ago) and were recently active in your application (7 or less days ago, for example), but did not buy / order.  Solution: most likely they are interested in the service, your task is to sell it.  It is possible and necessary to split users by content search. </li></ul><br>  2. Users who did not pay and actively use recently.  Most often, these are new users who need to finish and sell the service.  Can be segmented by frequency and age. <br><br><ul><li>  Looking for something (10, 20.30 days ago) and not bought.  Most likely, they are interested in buying, it remains only to remind myself and motivate.  Solution: works well semi-dynamics.  You select a user segment based on similar search criteria and create advertising content for them.  Dynamic banners that are created in real time on the basis of a user request and are shown at the most relevant moment are perfect.  This format is best implemented with Getloyal professionals. </li><li>  Showed interest in one of the categories or added to favorites / cart in recent days.  Solution: you divide the audience according to the general characteristic of the subject of the search or category and remind the user of an advertisement that he was interested in these things (semi-dynamic).  Or run dynamic banners with Getloyal. </li></ul><br>  3. Users who installed your application and did not produce any events.  The most difficult group to return.  It‚Äôs worth starting if you have learned to motivate the second group to make a payment.  It‚Äôs not a fact that the user still has your application installed, so the path to the content of the application will be built, just like for a new one. <br><br>  Solution: the simplest thing is to take such users by the time of installation.  The user installed (10, 20, 30, 60, 90 days ago) and did nothing in the application.  The closer the installation date, the more likely it is that he can still tell about the service: discounts, feature description, promotional code.  The further the date, the less will be the conversion to reattribution. <br><br><h2>  Segmentation in mobile e-commerce <br></h2><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/um/fo/5q/umfo5qc46u73ap_2pyl8j6p5szo.png"><br><br>  The experience of taxpayers can be learned from the travel and food delivery segments described.  Only in e-commerce bundles of goods work perfectly.  In the last 7 days, the user has bought item A, with which, according to statistics, goods B, C, D, E most often buy. And you create an audience from those who bought A with additional goods. <br><br>  <b>As for defaulters, the following segments can be distinguished:</b> <b><br></b> <br>  1. Those who have recently viewed a particular product or category of goods and have not bought.  Solution: select users by search categories and make semi-dynamic campaigns for specific categories.  Well, if the link is directly in the category from which the user was looking. <br><br>  2. Those who have recently added to the basket and have not bought.  Retargeting is a great way to sell, especially with working diplinks leading to the user‚Äôs cart.  Solution: dynamic retargeting with photos of added products on the banner is perfect. <br>  Well, if you get a funnel, and you are pushing the user at each stage.  Great if Cost per new customer &lt;LTV. <br><br><h2>  Segmentation in F2P Gaming <br></h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/i-/nx/nw/i-nxnw6ywe49nvgr9tg9qx9j1ay.png"><br><br>  The experience of creating segments from payers can be taken from previous verticals.  A breakdown by statute of limitations and payment amount is perfect.  It is always more interesting to return the so-called ‚Äúwhales‚Äù who abandoned the game.  Make, for example, a segment: pay more N-amount and did not go 30 days.  They are perfect news about updates in the game, new mechanics, new maps, levels, and so on. <br><br>  <b>For non-paying there are several other solutions:</b> <b><br></b> <br><ul><li>  You ‚Äúdrag‚Äù the user along the level chain: reached 1, but did not reach 2;  reached 3, but did not reach 4, and so on.  It works well, if you have an understanding of what conditional ‚Äúlevel‚Äù the user is likely to continue playing and eventually pay. </li><li>  Same as the first, but with Retention.  You know, for example, that after retention of 28 days, users are almost completely rejected.  Therefore, you train the user on certain days of life (1/7/14/28) and try to raise Retention and% of those who pay. </li><li>  For residual resources.  For example, the user has ended some resource in the game, and you offer him a gift or share with this resource.  Works great with the possibility of customized stocks and gifts. </li><li>  Cool shares.  It so happens that in the game are great promotions on very favorable terms.  Target advertising of this offer to those who have been actively playing lately, did not pay, but does not enter in recent days and may miss the action. </li></ul><br><h2>  Segmentation of subscription services </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/5b/iu/vi/5biuvi92x2lsthlsrujzzwagzvq.png"><br><br>  How you can work with defaulters, you can understand by reading the above.  But almost in every service with a subscription there is a category of users with a trial subscription.  They can not be called payers, because the fact of payment has not yet been, but these cards have already been entered. <br><br>  <b>This segment can be returned as follows:</b> <b><br></b> <br><ul><li>  The end date of the trial subscription.  Suppose the trial subscription duration is 14 days.  You create a segment of users who activated a trial subscription more than 14 days ago and did not complete the renewal event.  Finish the service.  You can go further and target those who clicked on the campaign and still not activated: you can offer a discount, if such is provided by the service. </li><li>  The second segment of those who paid after the trial, but did not extend the second time.  Activation date - the duration of your subscription + no extension event.  You are trying to remind the user that he was happy this period, great if there are so many users that you can separate them by frequency of use.  So you will be able to identify those who are most likely to extend + measure indicators on a particular audience. </li><li>  An extensive segment can come from those who installed the application and never entered or showed little activity.  It's time to offer them your trial subscription, during which the user will understand that life before the subscription was not life. </li></ul><br>  Article author: Alexander Yusupov, Traffic Team Lead in <a href="http://getloyal.ru/">Getloyal</a> . <br><br>  Getloyal is Russia's first automated retargeting system for mobile applications.
