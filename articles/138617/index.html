  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Communicator Huawei Honor - impressions of use</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A month ago, I got Huawei Honor, and a week ago I finally moved to it from HTC Desire.  I will not write a full review, I already have enough of them in the network, but I want to write something on trifles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f72/25c/a59/f7225ca59c44d163ab104cfc9096b4fb.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In general, I thought about changing the phone since the summer, but somehow I did not see worthy alternatives. <br>  In Desire, by and large, I was not satisfied with only two things - a small amount of memory for programs and a weak battery.  The first was solved with the help of a2sd - cutting the section for installing programs and mounting it instead of the regular one on the memory card, and the second with a spare battery.  But both solutions are crutches, a2sd made it difficult to change the memory card freely, and the second battery liked to spontaneously discharge in the winter. <br>  In today's communicators, the memory problem for programs has long been resolved (which prevented this in the desire generation devices, I don‚Äôt know), but with batteries everything was, as it was, under serious load - half a day. <br>  But Huawe U8860 Honor came up with a 1900mah battery, which gave some hope that the device would live out until the evening.  The bonus looked already released firmware based on Android 4. <br><br><h5>  TTX </h5><br>  <b>Operating system</b> : Android 2.3, aHome shell (upgrade to Android 4.0 ICS available) <br>  <b>Networks</b> : GSM / EDGE 850/900/1800/1900 MHz, UMTS / HSDPA 900/2100 <br>  Qualcomm MSM8255T platform, 1.4 GHz processor <br>  <b>RAM:</b> 512 MB <br>  <b>Memory for data storage</b> : ~ 2 800 MB + slot for microSD memory card <br>  <b>Interfaces</b> : Wi-Fi b / g / n, Bluetooth 2.1 + EDR (A2DP), microUSB (USB 2.0) connector for charge / sync, 3.5 mm for headset <br>  <b>Screen</b> : TFT, capacitive type, 4 ‚Äùdiagonal with 480x854 dots (FWVGA) resolution, automatic backlight level adjustment <br>  <b>Camera</b> : 8 MP with autofocus and flash, video is recorded in HD resolution (1280x720 pixels) <br>  <b>Navigation</b> : GPS on Qualcomm gpsOne chip (A-GPS support) <br>  <b>Optional</b> : FM radio, accelerometer, light sensor, proximity sensor <br>  <b>Battery</b> : removable Li-Pol with a capacity of 1930 mAh <br>  <b>Dimensions</b> : 122 x 61 x 11 mm, 140 mm <br>  <b>Weight</b> : 140 g

      In the gland - nothing outstanding, but not an obvious budget (somewhere I saw the phrase "budget flagship" :)).  Someone might want dual-core, but why is it on the phone?  Productivity is enough, where Desire stuttered slightly, Honor works faster. <br>  The screen is not bad, no worse than that of Desire, although it does not pull on the iphone4.  But because of the somewhat non-standard resolution of some toys stomps.  Although Cut the Rope works fine, but I don‚Äôt need more.  :) <br><br><h5>  Issue price </h5><br>  Srednedeksovaya - 12 thousand, I took for 13,900 with delivery. <br>  The Chinese are worth about 11 thousand, but, given the time of delivery and the problems of a guarantee, I don‚Äôt see it as meaning. <br>  <a href="http://www.dealextreme.com/p/huawei-u8860-honor-android-2-3-wcdma-smartphone-w-4-0-capacitive-wi-fi-and-gps-black-4-gb-113407">www.dealextreme.com/p/huawei-u8860-honor-android-2-3-wcdma-smartphone-w-4-0-capacitive-wi-fi-and-gps-black-4-gb-113407</a> <br><br><h5>  Ergonomics </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8f6/fdb/352/8f6fdb3524df6328e9971ce0f247f313.jpg"><br>  In the hand is good, but sometimes it seems a little longer than necessary. <br>  But with the buttons, not everything goes smoothly.  The volume and power are pressed normally, and touch Home, Back and Menu are annoying at first.  Somehow I got used to the fact that Home is on the left (like in HTC) or in the center and is somehow highlighted.  Here are 4 buttons - Menu, Home, Back and Search, not tactile in any way.  And the menu is the first.  I got used to it for about a week, but now I‚Äôm normally finding them by touch.  Vibration helps when pressed - did not turn off. <br><br>  By the way, on the renderers and exhibition samples Home was on the left.  But on the serial changed from the Menu. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/931/f59/f17/931f59f17d3b518412e69a39ba3aefac.jpg"><br><br><h5>  Battery </h5><br>  Basically, the main reason why the phone was bought.  The first days brought disappointment - with daily use (on the day 20-30 minutes of conversations, Internet hour, hourly check of rss and mail), the battery would sit down at the same speed as Desire - by the evening of the second day to zero. <br>  It helped the phone to fully charge (charge, remove from the charger, turn off, reconnect to the charger, wait 100%) and reset the Wipe battery stats via Recovery.  After that - on the morning of the fourth day - 30%. <br>  Under a serious load (navigator, player, reader) has not yet driven - it is necessary to go somewhere, but I think it will live out until evening.  In Desire, the battery would be sitting around 4:00 PM (when removed from charge at 7:00). <br><br><h5>  Firmware and Android 4.0 </h5><br>  There is no particular variety of firmwares yet - native and cyanogen (in which some of the functions are not working yet), this is not Desire with hundreds of firmware versions up to ICS. <br>  Therefore, I am still on my native 2.3, except that I received the root and installed CWM (ClockworkMod Recovery) - I like the full backup function there. <br>  4.0 tried, but rolled back - firstly, the battery quickly went down by 30 percent, and secondly, the touchscreen somehow worked strangely - it did not react to the touch the first time.  There will be time - I will play with 4.0 a little more, but so far I need a communicator, than games with a file.  :) <br><br><h5>  Links </h5><br>  Review on mobile-review: <a href="http://www.mobile-review.com/review/huawei-honor-u8860.shtml">www.mobile-review.com/review/huawei-honor-u8860.shtml</a> <br>  The page on the yandex-market: <a href="">market.yandex.ru/model.xml?modelid=7802213</a> <br>  Talk on w3bsit3-dns.com: <a href="http://4pda.ru/forum/index.php%3F%26showtopic%3D263882">w3bsit3-dns.com/forum/index.php?&amp;showtopic=263882</a> (ibid links to firmware) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/138617/">https://habr.com/ru/post/138617/</a></p>
